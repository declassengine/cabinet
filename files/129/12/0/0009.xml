THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT.....Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 309.30th July, 1946.CABINET.FULL EMPLOYMENT  IN GERMANY BEFORE  THE  WAR.Memorandum by the load President of the Council.I circulate herewith a memorandum prepared in the Economic Section of theCabinet Office on full employment in Germany before the war. This is purelyfor information, but I thought that it would be of interest to my colleagues tosee the memorandum.I am asking the Economic Section, if possible, to produce a similar memo-ranclum on full employment in Russia, though I am uncertain whether all thenecessary factual material is available.H. M.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,30th July, 1946.Full Employment in Germany before the War.The lessons to be learnt from the German experience in the field of full employment can be divided into two parts: (1) how it was attained; and (2) how the problems arising from its existence were solved.(1) The A ttainment of Full Employment-1932-36.When the Nazis attained power at the beginning of 1933, there were nearly6 million unemployed in Germany. By the spring of 1936 unemployment, wasdown to what we should regard as a very low peace-time level, and by the out-break of war it was almost negligible. The reduction of unemployment was animportant objective of policy in the first two years of Nazi government. Themethods used to attain it included some that would not be regarded as unorthodoxin other countries, but even at that early  date, and still more in the following-years, the real driving force behind economic recovery was expenditure onarmaments.In 1932 expenditure by the German public authorities on goods and services had been only 8 milliard reichsmarks. and private investment, including replace-ments of equipment, had sunk almost to zero. By 1936 Government expenditureon goods and services had reached about 19 milliard reichsmarks, and private invest-ment, including replacements, was perhaps 7 or 8 milliard reichsmarks. Theincrease in direct public expenditure was thus far greater than the increase in private investment, which, however, was itself largely a result of public activity.This public expenditure was mostly met by taxation, but in 1936 about  milliard reichsmarks that is over a fifth of public expenditure on goods and services was being raised by borrowing. Private investment was financed largelyput of business firms&apos; own reserves; the Government wished to reserve the capitalmarket for its own borrowing operations and exercised very great influence overthe investment policy of &quot; private &quot; industry, as will be shown below.The more direct attacks on unemployment were of far smaller importance.They included :  (i) The calling up of labour for secret military training prior to theannouncement of full conscription;(ii) A certain amount of control over the movements of workers, e.g., prohibi-tion of their migration to areas of heavy unemployment;[32206]
(iii) The exercise of pressure on employers to dismiss women and young menand to employ a higher proportion of fathers of families; and(iv) The institution of compulsory Labour Service in June 1935, partly as anadjunct to military training, partly to absorb labour in reclamation,drainage, forestry and other public works largely of a &quot;relief&quot;nature.There is thus no mystery about the way in which full employment wasattained. Any Government which spent as much as the Nazis in proportion tothe national income would have achieved impressive results, though it is truethat the German Government enjoyed the co-operation of private business far more than did, say, the Governments of the United States or of France in theircontemporary employment policies. The reasons for this are partly that the nazis got business on their side by abolishing trade unions and stabilising wages,partly that their main task -rearmament -was widely approved of by the businessclasses, but largely, again, because their expenditure was on such an enormousscale that it induced confident expectations of prosperity.(2) The Problems of Full Employment 1936/39.The problems of the German economy from early 1936 were those of wareconomy. What we should call full employment had been attained; the problems that remained were : (i) How to prevent the inflation of prices and wages; and(ii) How to divide the national product between war preparation and other purposes in such a way as to provide more guns and less butter.The Nazi Government at its arrival in power had found itself with very powerful controls over many sections of economic life inherited from itspredecessors. These were increased until it could directly manipulate Wages,prices, allocation of man-power, and the investment and production policies ofbusiness. There was then no problem of how to control enough elements in the economy to achieve a given result; the problem was rather to exercise the morethan sufficient powers the Government possessed in ways which were notself-contradictory.&apos; The main controls may be summarised as follows :  (a) Wages. Under the Labour Law of 1934, all employers were requiredto publish &quot; enterprise rules &quot; setting out wages, hours and conditionsof work. These rules, which were supposed to embody both guaranteedminimum wage rates and bonuses for increased efficiency, were subjectto the approval of the Government officers called Trustees of Labour.These Trustees were empowered to promulgate and enforce enterpriserules of their own making where necessary, and they did so freely. Infact, the pre-Nazi rates of wages were continued in force over mostof industry, almost the only changes up to the war being increases in previously low-paid occupations, such as building, mining, textiles,agriculture and domestic service, the supply of labour to which was insufficient as full employment was approached. Later (from June1938), power was given to the Trustees to fix maximum wages, andthis was done in the building and metal industries where the shortageof labour was causing competitive bidding by employers.(b) Distribution of Labour. The fact that it was possible to preserve theexisting relative wage rates with little change was largely due to the direct power which the Government possessed or acquired to movelabour to the occupations where it was most needed. The labour service has already been mentioned; in the later years (i.e., 1938onwards) labour was called up not to mitigate unemployment but to hasten essential works. The office of the Four-Year Plan was empowered in June 1938 to conscribe any resident in, Germany forwork connected with any part of that Plan. In October 1938 thepolice and local authorities were empowered to call up any citizenfor emergency service a power which was used in wartime forclearing up after air raids and preparing defences. Control over theallocation of ordinary labour was secured as the State graduallybecame the sole agency through which men could be engaged. Whenfull employment was reached and labour shortage in the war industriesbecame acute, the termination of employment from either side was prohibited except with official permission a measure applied in the metal industries in November 1936 and many other industries in 1939.
In the early days of the regime measures were taken to prevent adrift out of agriculture; no agricultural labourer could be engaged fornon-agricultural work without permission, and power was taken toreturn all ex-agricultural workers to the land from other employ-ments. As industial labour got tighter, however, these provisions wererepealed, and the shortage of labour in agriculture was dealt with by providing that no unmarried woman under 25 could be given any non-agricultural work unless she had first served a year in agriculture.The control on the distribution of labour was, however, by no means at all direct. The Government control over production in indusrty was a powerful check on the absorption of labour into those trades which, though they might be attractive to the workers, were not con-sidered essential by the Government.(c) The Control of Prices. The elimination of wage increases removed oneof the factors which might have led to an inflationary spiral. Theother factor the level of prices was controlled with equal rigidity.Already in 1934 the increase, without permission, of those prices which were fixed by cartels, trade associations, &amp;c, was prohibited.In October 1936, however, a positive control over prices was establishedthrough the Reich Price Commissioner, who was given complete powerto regulate all prices except those of labour. In the following month the Price Commissioner ruled that prices were, in general, to be stabilised at the level then ruling; from then onwards numerouschanges were permitted in individual cases; the general plan was totake the existing price structure, with all its regional differences andapparent anomalies, complete, and to adjust it piecemeal to therequirements of the changing situation.(d) Control of Industry. The Nazi Government was not content to letprivate enterprise function as it liked, even within a State-determinedframework of wages and prices. As already mentioned, it subjectedit to a certain amount of direct interference through controls over theallocation of man-power, and its activities also extended beyond thatto direct control over capacity and production. The most complete control was exercised through allocation of materials with regard towhich the Government wielded positive as well as negative powers;it not only rationed materials but controlled their production and con-sumption directly through &quot;orders to produce&quot; and &quot;orders toprocess or use.&quot;Under the Compulsory Cartel Act of 1933, moreover, the Govern-ment was empowered to control both the degree of utilisation and the capacity of all industrial equipment. Thus it was able, through stillanother channel, to prescribe any firm&apos;s output of any commodity.There were still further direct negative controls over investment, sincefrom 1937 all construction requiring more than two tons of steel hadto be licensed.The problem of making it financially profitable for industry to engage in the forms of production which the Government requiredhad also to be tackled. As mentioned above, private firms were keptout of the capital market in general and encouraged to undertakeapproved expansion at the expense of their own reserves; the financialinducement to undertake such expansion was provided either by subsidies, as in the copper and ship-building industries, or by long-term Government contracts for purchase of the product at fixed price as in the synthetic oil and synthetic rubber industries. The Govern-ment also formed firms into compulsory groups for the joint under-taking of certain developments such as hydrogenation of coal andsynthetic fuel manufacture. In some of the few cases where firms were permitted to borrow in the capital market, the Government guaranteedthe loans, e.g., in the synthetic fibre industry.(3) The General Results.As a result of these extensive and, as it would appear, more than sufficientcontrols, the Government was able to guide the economy along a course which wasvery unusual by peace-time standards. The total output in 1938/39 stood pro-bably more than 25 per cent, above the 1929 level, but consumption had barelypassed the level of 1929, an increase of population in the meantime nofwithstand-ing.  Prices had risen only by some 7 per cent, on the average since the Nazis took

The total output in 1938/39 stood pro-bably more than 25 per cent, above the 1929 level, but consumption had barelypassed the level of 1929, an increase of population in the meantime notwithstand-ino-.  Prices had risen only by some 7 per cent, on the average since the Nazis took
control in the depts of the depression, and hourly wage-rates had increased even less, though the number of hours worked, and therefore total earnings, had gone up much more. Thus there can be no denying that the German system did achieve its object, which was the full mobilisation of the economy for rearmament and war, without inflation.The problems which the Nazis solved were largely different from those whichface a free economy seeking to attain full employment. The first difference is thatthey had an inexhaustible supply of public works &quot; with which to stimulate the economy, which &apos;&apos; public works &apos;&apos; were more important to them than the full employment which they produced as a by-product. The second difference was thatthey had autocratic power over every branch of economic life, in particular overthe level of wages and the distribution of man-power. This made their taskrelatively easy, and indeed it seems certain that given their powers they mighthave achieved their aims with a good deal less administrative machinery and feweradministrative muddles than they in fact produced.On the other hand, because they were determined not simply to achieve full employment (as we are) on the basis of the maximum consumption that could be afforded, but to squeeze down consumption in order to produce the maximum ofarmaments, their problem was a larger one than faces this country. Any lessonswhich their experience before the war might have taught us we can, in fact, learnmuch better from our own war-time experience, and the extent to which even thisis applicable to the peace-time problems of full employment is obviously limited.The German pre-war economy and our war economy were economies of &quot; over-employment &apos;&apos; in which a central problem was to restrict production and employ -ment for personal consumption in order to release resources for the war sector.Our peace-time employment policy will, to this extent, be less difficult, since weshall welcome the maintenance of employment by means of improved standards of consumption.At the same time the absence of such extensive direct controls over industry may make it necessary to rely rather more on inducements than on direct controlsin order to deal with some of the same problems which confronted Germany. Ourpowers may be less extensive in the field of investment and prices. This willcertainty be the case in the labour market in the absence of authoritarian powers;and we shall accordingly have to find other means of answering the two questions,how to prevent a general inflation of money wage rates in spite of a continuinghigh demand for labour and how to attract labour to any vital but undermannedindustries in the absence of a large-scale reserve of general unemployment.
