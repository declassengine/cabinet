IllTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  Jtily 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 302.26th July, 1946.CABINET.VISAS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Eoreign Affairs.VISAS on passports were introduced by the United Kingdom during thefirst world war as a security measure, but were rapidly abandoned after thewar in respect of all the nearby countries. They were retained mainly in respectof distant countries, in the interests of the travellers themselves. In the casesof Russia and Asiatic countries alone were they retained as a security measure.2. Agreements for the mutual abolition of visas between the United King-dom and Trance and Belgium were initiated by the Governments of those countriesearly in 1921, and came into effect in July 1921. The agreement with luxembourg -bourg followed in 1922, those with Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and switzerland in 1923, and those with Denmark and Sweden in 1924. agreements with Portugal and Austria were concluded in 1927, with Germany in 1928 andwith Czechoslovakia in 1930.3. On the outbreak of World War No. 2 visa abolition agreements werein force with all the Western European countries, except with Germany and austria, the agreements with which countries were denounced in 1938. In somecases they covered overseas territories.4. Some measure of relief from visa delays has been afforded to practically all persons of Allied or neutral nationality travelling to this country on reasonable grounds, other than simple holiday-making, by delegating discretion to the localBritish visa-issuing authorities abroad to grant visas without having to refereach application to the home authority. But with the increase of transport facilities which may be expected during the next twelve months, the strongestpressure will be exerted by public bodies for the extension of these reliefs to allclasses of travellers.5. It is not to be expected, however, that the public will be satisfied witha mere reduction of the delays connected with the issue of visas. The burden of having to obtain a visa for a journey, say to France or Belgium, is vexatious,and we must aim at the complete reciprocal abolition of visas between the UnitedKingdom and all countries which British subjects in large numbers regularlyvisit or of which the nationals regularly visit the United Kingdom.6. An immediate obstacle to the initiation of a programme of reciprocalvisa-abolition is the restriction on the visits of foreign tourists to this countryimplied by the Cabinet in the decision taken at its meeting on the 11th march last (CM. (46) 23rd Meeting). I am of the opinion that this ban should be liftedforthwith. I do not think that either the food position or the accommodationposition should be allowed to interfere any longer with the flow of visitors to thiscountry. The conclusion of agreements for the reciprocal abolition of visas will,by stimulating travel from this country, gradually reduce the number of food-consumers here sufficiently to balance the inflow of consumers from abroad. And,as to accommodation, an announcement could be made warning the public thatvisitors to the United Kingdom must be prepared to put up with the difficult conditions they will find.13460   [32197]
7. A possible objection to the initiation of a programme of reciprocal visa-abolition is that it will impair security. The answer is, I think, that diminishedsecurity is a risk that must be faced. Determined! scoundrels will find meansof entering this country visa or no visa, and we cannot, in my view, continue toput obstacles in the way of the large majority of honest foreigners wishing toenter the country merely in the hope of keeping out a few rascals.8. As regards any loss of revenue through the conclusion of agreements forthe reciprocal abolition of visas there is no reason to suppose that any morerevenue will be sacrificed than was sacrificed before the recent war, when so many visa-abolition agreements were in force. I hope too that my colleagues willshare my opinion that any loss.of revenue will be fully offset by the advantages. to be gained from the greatly improved facilities between the United Kingdomand the countries concerned. Certainly from the political angle, the abolitionof visas would materially improve our relations with foreign countries. Theirritation caused by the present formalities is already seriously prejudicing ourrelations with France and Belgium.9. I therefore ask my colleagues (a) to agree to the immediate relaxation of the restriction on the admission of foreign tourists to this country and (b) toauthorise me to initiate negotiations for the conclusion of agreements for the reciprocal abolition of visas with all countries, within the limits suggested atthe end of paragraph 5, that ax-e willing to conclude such agreements. It isunderstood that these agreements would apply only to nationals of the countriesparties to the agreements.E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,2Qth July, 1946.
