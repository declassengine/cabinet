THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1946.SECRET. Copy No. -CP. (46) 317.2nd August, 1946.CABINET.CIVIL AIRCRAFT REQUIREMENTS.Joint Memorandum by the Minister of Supply and the Minister of CivilAviation.1. The situation as to the availability of suitable British civil transport aircraft in the next few years is causing us concern. Evidence of the intenseactivity on competitive civil aircraft in the United States still further increasesour disquiet.2. Accordingly, we have recently undertaken a joint review of our forwardcivil aircraft position. The situation revealed is far from satisfactory, so faras aircraft for the Atlantic and Empire routes is concerned, and requiresimmediate attention.3. The position is that although from 1950 onwards the de HavillandD.H. 106 (Brabazon IV), the Bristol 167 (Brabazon I) and the Saunders RoeSaro. 45 Flying-boat all show high promise of enabling us to exploit the leadwhich we already have in the development of gas turbines, the indications are that there will be a deplorable lack of new and competitive British types forAtlantic and Empire services between 1948 and 1950. These are the years during which our services on these routes must be consolidated.4. The situation is understandable, and indeed inevitable, in view of the disruption caused by the war. Experience both in this country and in america has shown that a period of at least 5 years will normally elapse from the date when the requirement for a new large civil airliner is first stated until thedate when it goes into service. Thus types which should be coming into operation in 1948 would have had to be initiated in 1942 or 1943, when the war was at its height.5. Indeed the fact that we shall have any new types of civil aircraft inthe larger classes at all during the next two years is mainly the result of thework done in implementing the recommendations of the two Brabazon Committees.The first Brabazon Committee recommended five new types of civil aircraft to the Secretary of State for Air in February 1943. The second BrabazonCommittee elaborated these requirements and added two additional types. Detailsof these Brabazon aircraft are set out at Annex A.6. Additional interim or &quot; stopgap &quot; types developed from military designswere agreed before the end of the war and are now flying as the Avro York,the Avro Tudor I, the Avro Tudor II, the Handley Page Halton, the HandleyPage Hastings/Hermes, the Vickers Viking and the Short Hythe andSandringham class flying boats. The Avro Lancastrian and the Avro XIX were brought into civil operation in 1945 by conversion of the Lancaster bomber andthe Anson. Designs for the Bristol Freighter and Wayfarer, the Cunliffe OwenConcordia, the Percival Merganser, the Miles Aerovan and other types wereinitiated independently as private ventures.
7. As a result there are on the stocks at present more than 30 different types of civil aircraft and Government orders for some 350 aircraft of 23 different types are outstanding. The vast majority of these are due for delivery beforethe end of 1947.8. Many serious problems lie ahead. Last February, as our colleagues will remember, it was found necessary to buy 5 Lockheed Constellations from theUnited States for the North Atlantic service. While it was recognised that the boeing strato--Cruiser was likely to prove a superior type to the Constellation,choice of the former would have involved waiting until late 1947. We are planning to introduce the Tudor I on the North Atlantic service early in 1947.An adverse situation is, however, regrettably pending. From the autumn of1947 onwards all our competitors on the North Atlantic including threeAmerican companies, the Swedes and probably the Dutch and French- are likelyto bring into service the new Boeing strato--Cruiser 60. Both Tudors and Con-stellations of B.O.A.C. will be outclassed by the strato--Cruiser. They will be unable successfully to compete with it. No competitive type of British aeroplaneis likely to be available for the day service on the North Atlantic air routebetween the end of 1947 and 1950, or possibly even later.9. Our next problem is likely to arise on the Empire routes. It was roundduring the recent discussions in Canberra that Australian opinion was decidedlyin favour of buying American aircraft for the Sydney-London service. british types were regarded as likely to be inferior in performance and economy. with difficulty an agreement was obtained to postpone a decision in favour of american aircraft until September 1946 to allow time for the Avro Tudor II to undergoprototype trials and to demonstrate its capabilities. The use by the Australiansof American aircraft on the Sydney-London route would jeopardise partnershipoperation, based on the use of common types of aircraft.   It would also causefrievous harm to the market for British aircraft in Australia. We shall beortunate if we can avoid it.- 10. We have already indicated that this serious state of affairs is solely alegacy of the war. We devoted our efforts to bombers and fighters while the americans were developing their military transport aircraft, civil versions ofwhich are now appearing as Constellations, strato--Cruisers, Rainbows, andDC-6s. We cannot retrieve what has inevitably been lost. But we can ensurethat there is no repetition of the existing state of affairs. A vigorous and far-sighted policy is needed to plan and proceed with new British aircraft which canlead the world.11. During the next 10 years we have to establish a world wide net-workof British air services. Our declared policy is that the benefits of mass air travelat cheap rates shall be made available to all. The travelling public is certain toexpress a demand for varying frequencies of service, a variety of cruising speeds,sizes of aircraft, standards of comfort and duration of flights. We must answerthese demands with efficient aircraft. To do this we must determine the relativeadvantages of the landplane and the flying boat. We must explore the full com-mercial possibilities of jet propulsion and new aerodynamic developments such asthe tailless aircraft. We must discover the possibilities of helicopters for travelbetween airports and city centres and between closely situated cities. We mustinvestigate the economics of air cargo operations and whether air freight and passenger carrying should be combined or segregated.12. In addition to this requirement for a variety of new types of aircraftevolved in a carefully balanced programme, we must emphasise the need for thepresent maximum effort on research to be sustained indefinitely. An era of rapid expansion in air travel is before us, opening up new possibilities of trade as wellas a new realm of export markets. Now, more than ever before, we must striveto keep ahead of our competitors in the air. Jet propulsion, new aerodynamicforms, de-icing and cabin pressurisation all require particular attention. our success in such research and development and in subsequent production will deter-mine whether we obtain the lead for which we are striving.13. The war-time concentration of the production of transport aircraft in american hands has paid them handsome dividends during the past few months.United States and foreign orders have been placed with the American industries for some 1,075 transport aircraft to the value of over one hundred million poundssterling. For the future the Americans are developing about a dozen turbine orjet-powered transports backed by more than 20 new piston aircraft as an insurance against delays in the successful introduction of jet aircraft into civil
use. We have our advantages, too. Already we are receiving enquiries from theUnited States as to whether we are prepared to build and sell turbine engines for installation in American air frames. Approaches have been made by the lockheed, Douglas and Consolidated Manufacturing Companies and by theT.W.A. Airline. There would be advantages in prestige, in dollar exchange andin operating experience in satisfying these demands as regards engines on the openlist, so far as we are able to do so without setting back our own requirements.14. All this indicates a need for immediate ad hoc consideration of thewhole position to bring the critical points into perspective and to frame thenecessary action. Gaps in current programmes must be filled. Failures mustbe forestalled and insured against by alternative designs. An imaginative,forward-looking programme must be planned to match the swift technicaladvances. New types in addition to those already planned for service in 1950and onwards must be laid down now with adequate safeguards againstdisappointments.15. As a first step, after mutual conversations we appointed last May anofficial Inter-Departmental Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir HenrySelf, including top-level representatives of the three Corporations, to review thepresent programme of design and construction, to compare the position with thatobtaining in other countries, to prepare recommendations on the types of civil aircraft which should be developed and to prepare statements of requirements.The Committee has submitted an interim report which I attach hereto as annex B.Decisions Required.A. Proposed Purchase of American Aircraft.16. There is one aspect of the report to which we must draw particular attention. That aspect is the gap in competitive British aircraft suitable forthe North Atlantic and Empire routes which threatens between the years 1948and 1950. The Committee has not been able to make specific recommendations for filling this gap from British sources, but has set up a Panel to investigate the possibility of providing a contribution from existing British designs. Itis clear, however, that, while this may produce useful results, any such expedientoan only be supplementary to the provision of a number of American aircraft for the North Atlantic route.17. There are two American types which are likely to be in advance of anycontemporary competitors on the North Atlantic services between 1948 and 1950,both from the point of view of economics and performance, namely, the BoeingStrato-Cruiser and the Republic Rainbow. Although the Rainbow has a higherspeed, the strato--Cruiser is probably a better proposition from our point of viewfor the following reasons : (i) Delivery should be possible six months in advance of the Rainbow;(ii) It is approximately 11 per cent, more economic to operate per seat mile;(iii) It provides additional comfort;(iv) It is backed by a constructor of proved air transport experience;(v) It is a more flexible aeroplane in operation, both in payload and inrange.18. Our information is that only 60 strato--Cruisers are being made andthat orders have already been placed for 42. The Committee has explored thepossibility of obtaining an option on a number of these aircraft, but has cometo the definite conclusion that there is no alternative but to decide here and nowwhether a limited number shall be ordered or not. For effective operation a fleet of 6 would be necessary, costing, with initial outfits of spare parts, about12 million dollars. Against this, however, must be set countervailing dollar earnings estimated at 14 million dollars gross for the years 1948/1949.19. We accept the views of the Committee as to the necessity for the purchaseof these 6 strato--Cruisers if we are to be in a position to compete on anything like equal terms with the Americans on the North Atlantic route before our owndesigns are in production, and we ask our colleagues to authorise the purchaseof this number of strato--Cruisers. An order must be placed at once if we areto obtain them.
B. Allocation of Design and Production Capacity.20. Should any conflict arise in allocating design and production capacitythe Minister of Civil Aviation asks that priority should be given to civil aircraft(including their engines) of the following types : (a) Bristol Brabazon I     ...      ...   8 reciprocating engines or 8 propellorturbine engines.(b) de Havilland DH-106......   4 jet engines.(c) Avro Brabazon III     ...      ...   4 propellor turbine engines.(d) Supplementary Type to Braba-zon III(e) Armstrong - Whitworth   Braba-zon IIb        ...      ...      ...   4 propellor turbine engines,.(/) Vickers-Armstrong VC-2      ...   4 propellor turbine engines.(g) Miles Marathon II     ...      ...   2 propellor turbine engines.(k) Saunders   Roe   SR-45   FlyingBoat   ...      ...      ...      ...      propellor turbine engines.C. Underwriting of Production.21. In the interests both of civil aviation and the export trade, the Ministerof Supply should be authorised in suitable cases to encourage aircraft manufac-turers to lay down production, in advance of actual orders if necessary, and, inappropriate cases and with suitable safeguards, to underwrite such production.D. Technical Staffs.22. Special steps should be taken to strengthen the Technical Staffs of the&apos;Ministry of Civil Aviation and of the Air Division of the Ministry of Supply23. In conclusion we may add that, if, as we hope, our foregoing recom-mendations are accepted, the question of placing production orders for the United.Kingdom types envisaged in Annex B will be pursued inter-departmentally.J.

THE review of the present programme for British civil aircraft, whichthe Committee on Civil Aircraft Requirements was instructed to undertake, hasshown three serious gaps in the variety of types due for delivery during thenext five years.2. First, and most serious. No British aeroplane capable of competing inperformance or economics with contemporary American types, can be broughtinto service over the North Atlantic between 1948 and 1950. The Avro Tudor Iand the Lockheed Constellation of B.OA.C. will not be competitive with the boeing Stratocruiser or the Republic Rainbow, likely to be used, from 1948onwards, by almost all foreign airlines operating across the North Atlantic.3. Secondly. No British aeroplane capable of competing on level terms with the American Lockheed Constellation II, Douglas DC-6, Republic Rainbowand. possibly, the Boeing Stratocruiser, on Empire trunk routes, will be availablebetween 1948 and 1950&apos;4. Thirdly. Although the de Havilland DH-106, the Bristol Brabazon I,,and the Saunders-Roe, SR-45 flying-boat all show high promise for north atlantic and (except for Brabazon I) Empire operations, all these types arestill in the design stage and therefore might be delayed in coming into service.At present, no alternative is available to meet such a contingency.5. The filling of the North Atlantic gap between 1948 and 1950 is a matter for higher policy on which a recommendation is made in the covering minute.This situation must be faced frankly. But there can be no recrimination about it. The British commercial aircraft which should be coming into service to*fill the gap would have had to be designed in 1942 and 1943, during the most critical stage of the war when all available efforts were needed on military affairs.6. Competition from newer American aircraft on the Empire trunk routes between 1948 and 1950, in the opinion of the Committee must be met so far aspossible by the Avro Tudor II, the Handley Page Hermes and the Short Solent,possibly eked out by the five B.O.A.C. Constellations now operating over theNorth Atlantic, if they can be spared. We recommend that the Avro Brabazon IIIbe pressed forward as quickly as possible to ensure effective British competitionon the Empire routes from 1950 onwards, and should be made flexible enough
so that the aeroplane could act as a stop-gap on the North Atlantic should thethree long-range projects be delayed. At the same time, we are of the opinionthat requirements for a supplementary type to the Brabazon III should be formulated at once.7. The Committee further recommends that the highest priority be givento design, development and production of the following new aircraft:: (a) de Havilland DH-106 (four jet engines).(b) Avro Brabazon III (four propeller-turbine engines).(c) Supplementary Type to Brabazon III.(d) Armstrong-Whitworth    Brabazon    IIb    (four    propeller-turbineengines).(e) Vickers-Armstrongs VC-2 (four propeller-turbine engines).(/) Miles Marathon II (two propeller-turbine engines).8. In addition to the airframes, equal priority should be given to thedevelopment of the new engines needed to power them.Details of and reasons for these recommendations are set out in the appro-priate sections of this Report.9. Most particularly, the Committee emphasises that, in its opinion, a boldforward policy of design and production orders is essential if British aircraft are to be kept to the forefront on the airways of the world. It is of first importance that they should be available at the right time; the cycle from firstconception to operational use takes three to seven years depending on the size and/or enterprising nature of the design. American Constellations and strato--cruisers have gained world markets this year to the value of more than 33 million sterling because they were available for delivery at the time theywere wanted.10. So far prototypes only have been ordered for a number of civil transport&quot;aircraft under development, including the Handley Page Hermes, the MilesMarathon and the Vickers VC-2. In paragraph 23 we make recommendations with regard to production orders for these and other types. The earliest possibleproduction is required not only so that the aircraft can be available to thethree British Corporations, but so that they can command world sales also.There is little doubt that they will do so if they are available in the rightnumbers at the right time. The Committee do not, however, consider that alarge export trade in civil transport aircraft will be achieved by leaving itsolely to private enterprise to lay down production in advance of actual orders,and urge that in appropriate cases, and with suitable safeguards, the Governmentshould underwrite such production.Present Programme.11. A total of 350 civil transport aircraft of 23 different types are now on order by the Government from the British Aircraft Industry. They range inestimated cruising speed from 120 m.p.h. to 360 m.p.h. and in seating capacityfrom four day passengers to 72 (sleeper) passengers. Fourteen of these types,totalling 307 aircraft are developments of existing wartime designs. There are on order nine new types representing 43 aircraft. Production orders have beengiven for 330 aircraft of 17 types. All the 350 aircraft, production andprototypes, are due for delivery before 1951. The value of the aircraft orderedfor the three British Corporations is approximately  18-1 million sterling. Thevalue of the prototypes on order amounts to a further  7-1 million sterling, makinga total of approximately  26 million sterling for the 350 aircraft.12. This statement of the situation appears favourable- until it is analysedin detail.   The present programme gives flight dates as follows :  (a) 1946-47 : 343 aircraft of 20 types.(6) 1948-49 : 5 aircraft of 4 types.Indeed,- only four types of civil aircraft now flying (the Tudors, the Vikingand the Wayfarer) account for 66 per cent, of production orders and 63 per cent,of all orders. All these aircraft are due for delivery before the end of 1947.In addition the industry have outstanding orders from non-Governmentpurchasers (mainly overseas operators) for approximately 230 civil transport,aircraft, most of which will be delivered before the end of 1947.
13. In the face of the immense commitments which face British air transport throughout the world in the years ahead, and the prospects of export business on a substantial scale, this total of orders cannot be considered adequate and is particularly deficient in respect of the years 1948 and 1949.14. Analysed in detail, on a comparable basis with that of the present Britishprogramme quoted above, the planned flight dates for the new American types nowbuilding are as follows :  (a) 1946-47: 922 aircraft of 9 types;(b) 1948-49 : 407 aircraft of 5 types (orders for some further 600 aircraft of three types are pending).The total of 1,075 American aircraft for which firm orders have been placed(subject to guarantees on performance, delivery and price) range in seatingcapacity from 12 day passengers to 204 day passengers and in normal cruisingspeed from 200 m.p.h. to 410 m.p.h.15. In the light of these comparisons the Committee is of the opinion thatthe scale of this country&apos;s activities in civil aircraft production is at presentinadequate, and must be substantially increased if we are to secure our rightfulplace in world air transport and in the world market for civil aircraft.16. For convenience of analysis and discussion, the Committee has dividedthe working programme into three phases : .Phase One: 1946-47.Phase Two: 1948-49.Phase Three : 1950 onwards.17. Obviously little can be done now to improve the position during thefirst Phase (1946-47) except to press forward the production and the bringing into service of types such as the Tudors, the Viking and the Wayfarer and tofinalise proposals for Phases Two and Three.18. During Phase Two (1948-49), particular emphasis should be given totypes which can be produced for European operations and for foreign markets.Unfortunately, for the reasons explained hereafter, little can be done to improve the position on Atlantic and Empire routes.19. Phase Three is the most important. It offers the greatest scope for present efforts to produce results. The Committee has had vividly in mind that proposals made now for new types of aircraft in the larger classes cannot cometo fruition before Phase Three.Phase One (1946-47).(a) B.O.A.C. (Atlantic).20. Only one type of British aeroplane the Avro Tudor I will be inoperational service over the North Atlantic during Phase One. The Tudor I now seems likely to begin regular services early in 1947. It will provide comfortablesleeper accommodation and in this respect will be superior to competing Constella-tions. But, economically, it will not be able to compete with the BoeingStratocruiser which is due to appear in service in the Autumn of 1947. Never-theless, the pressurised Tudor I should be able to compete effectively with theunpressurised Canadair DC-4M 1 to be operated by Trans-Canada Airlines on the montreal-London service during Phase One.Neither the B.O.A.C. Constellations nor the Tudors can be expected to competecommercially between New York and London after the end of 1947. On theCanadian route their commercial life may be prolonged into Phase Two.(b) B.O.A.C. (Empire).Lancastrians, Yorks, and Hythe flying boats are at present maintainingB.O.A.C.&apos;s Empire services. All these aircraft are obsolescent. Two new british types will be coming into service for main-line Empire routes during Phase One.The Avro Tudor II is due on to regular Empire services early in 1947. The ShortSolent flying boat should appear about the same time.These British aircraft are likely to be in competition with the LockheedConstellation IIa (operated by T.W.A., Pan-American, K.L.M. and Air France)[32004] c 2
and the Douglas DC-4 and the Douglas DC-6 (operated by Air France, K.L.M.and Sabena). The Tudor II and the Solent can be expected to hold their own upto the end of Phase One, provided that certain aerodrome difficulties can be over-come on the South African route, and provided also that the Australian andSouth African Governments adhere to their present plans to operate british equipment in parallel with B.O.A.C. Such adherence must depend largely on theshowing of the Tudor II during the next few months.(c) BE.A.The situation in relation to the shorter-haul European services is much more encouraging. The Vickers-Armstrongs Viking, and the Bristol Wayfarer, whenfully developed for passenger carrying, each in its class appear superior to anylikely type of foreign competitor during Phase One. The Committee has in mind the desirable development of mass air travel at cheap rates for which theWayfarer, in particular, should be suitable.For feeder-line work, the Avro XIX (Anson XII) is a poor aeroplane, whereas the DH-Dominie continues to perform gallantly and economically, but should besuperseded as soon as possible on many of the routes.The aircraft situation for B.E.A. during Phase One is therefore good. Butoperations are being limited by the inadequacy of ground facilities.(d) B.S.A.A.Lancastrians and Yorks are doing well on the South American services. Theyare not proving to be so uneconomic as on Empire routes partly as a result of thehigh-densit)^ conversion planned by B.S.A.A. for the Lancastrian.Tudor Is and IIs will show a substantial improvement on these earlier types.(e) To sum up.B.O.A.C.&apos;s aircraft position on North Atlantic and Empire routes duringPhase One will be only just adequate in the face of intense foreign competition.The position of B.E.A. and B.S.A.A. is likely to be satisfactory, although bothCorporations will encounter increasing competition. All the Corporations stresstheir dependence on the provision of adequate ground facilities.Phase Two (1948-49).(a) B.O.A.C. (Atlantic).21. Phase Two is the most difficult which British Air Transport has to face on the North Atlantic. Foreign competition, with new American aircraft,will be at its fiercest. No new British type will be available. The Tudor I andConstellation Ia will be outclassed. All our competitors on the North Atlantic American Overseas Airlines, Pan-American, TWA, KLM, SILA, and AirFrance seem likely to be armed with either the Boeing Stratocruiser or theRepublic Rainbow during this period. Of the two, the Stratocruiser appears tobe the more formidable. Although it is some 40 m.p.h. slower than the Rainbow,it is cheaper to operate; it has a&apos;bigger payload, more range, increased comfort and superior maintenance qualities, besides being backed by a company withwide air transport experience. Compared with the Constellation Ia, the strato--cruiser provides about 50 per cent, more payload for the North Atlantic operationwith 30 per cent, higher cruising speed and could be operated at about 75 percent, of the Constellation^ passenger fare. In these conditions, the Tudor Iand the Constellation could not operate successfully against the Stratocruiser.The choice appears to be either inferior high-cost services with British aircraft,or acquisition of American aircraft.(b) B.O.A.C. (Empire).On Empire routes also, B.O.A.C. is in a difficult position during Phase Two.The Tudor II and the Solent will probably be opposed by an improved DC-and the Rainbow, both of which are faster and more economical than either ofthe British types. The Handley-Page Hermes may prove to be more suitable thanthe Tudor II for operation to South Africa, particularly for take off from air-ports such as Nairobi, situated 5,000 feet or more above sea-level. The possibilitiesof rocket-assisted take-off such as has been applied successfully to DC-3s inthe United States are worth exploring for the Tudor II.Thus the position of B.O.A.C. on Empire routes during Phase Two is poor though not so critical as on the North Atlantic, which is the great prestige
route of the World. The position will become even worse if the commonwealth governments do not adhere to the plans for the use of British equipment forparallel operation with B.O.A.C.(c) B.E.A.The situation of B.E.A. during Phase Two appears rosy compared withthat of B.O.A.C. Vikings will continue in operation and should do well until theend of 1949. The Vickers-Arm strongs VC-2. the Viking replacement, is likelyto come into service by the Summer of 1949 and should show a substantial improve-ment upon the earlier type. Competition from the Martin 202 and 303 or fromthe Convair 240 might be expected from American companies &quot; changing gauge &quot;after the Atlantic crossing. The VC-2 seems likely to be able to compete favour-ably with these American types and might even land orders from the american companies for &quot;change of gauge&quot; operations.The Miles Marathon II with Mamba turbines holds much promise. If orders are placed at once, the Marathon II should be available towards the end of PhaseTwo when it would be superior to any presently known competitor in its class.(d) B.S.A.A.The Tudor I, Tudor II, and possibly the Hermes are likely to give goodservice throughout Phase Two on the South American run. Nevertheless, thepossibility of competition from the DC-6, Constellation 11a or even the Rainbowmust not be ignored. Should such competition materialise, B.S.A.A. would find,themselves in much the same invidious position as B.O.A.C. on the Empire routes,unless a British aeroplane of more advanced type such as the DH-106 can be made,available during Phase Two for South Atlantic operation.;(e) To stim ztp.During Phase Two, B.O.A.C. cannot compete commercially on the north atlantic using available British in Constellation Ia&apos;s. On Empire routes^B.O.A.C. will be in a difficult position because of lack of new British equipment Indeed, the B.O.A.C. position may well become commercially desperate ifCommonwealth Governments go to United States types. On the other hand..B.E.A. should do well if projected types come up to expectations. B.S.AA. willnot be in serious trouble unless the competition intensifies unexpectedly.In general, the situation on both the North Atlantic and Empire routes isdisquieting, but little can be done to improve it with such British types as canbe made available during Phase Two. On the other hand the position on theBritish European services is encouraging.Phase Three (1950 onwards).(a) B.O.A.C. (Atlantic).22. Phase Three provides the opportunity for British aircraft to comeinto their own.The Bristol Brabazon I should come into service during 1950, to be followed.and supported on the air routes in 1951 by the Saunclers-Roe SR-45 flying boat.If they come up to expectations, both types should hold their own with presentlyknown competition. But the dates at which the)&apos; will become operational will mean that there mayT be American aircraft of similar performance in competition with them.Much is hoped from the de Havilland DH-106 jet-propelled aeroplane. Butit is doubtful whether in its North Atlantic version it could be in service before1951. If it comes up to expectations it will form a valuable unit in a fleetincluding also the Brabazon I and the Saro SR-45.Competition may be expected1 after 1951 from a propellor-turbine version of the Boeing Stratocruiser, from a jet-powered development of the RepublicRainbow, from the big turbine-powered Lockheed Constellation III (240,000 lb.)and Consolidated &quot; Super Clipper &quot; (320.000 lb.) as well as from new, high-speed, jet-driven Boeing Consolidated, Douglas, Lockheed, North American,Northrop and Martin types-all now in the design stage. There is therefore no room for complacency and every need to plan still further ahead.- In a later Report, the Committee intends to make further recommendations in the light of estimates by B.O.A.C. on its future traffic requirements.
(b) B.O.A.C. (Empire).As over the Atlantic, so on Empire routes, British aircraft will be faced bycontinued vigorous foreign competition in Phase Three. The Brabazon IIIshould begin service in 1950 and be able to hold its .own for a reasonable periodagainst likely opposition, particularly if made sufficiently flexible in payloadand in range to provide an alternative in case of the failure or delay of the projected types for the North Atlantic operation. A supplementary type should1be planned immediately.The DH-106 should prove valuable on express Empire services and willprobably be available for this purpose earlier than for the North Atlantic service.Further broad requirements for successors to both the Brabazon III and theDH-106 will be prepared by this Committee. In the interval after 1952 and before the still newer types could appear, the Saro SR-45 boats might haveadditional Empire possibilities, subject to base facilities being available.(c) B.E.A.Although the VC-2 and the Marathon II should continue usefully in service^until 1954, requirements for new and much more advanced types are needed inthe early future. There appears every prospect of the likely British lead on european air routes being maintained, provided new requirements are framedwith imagination.  The Committee intends to submit proposals in a later Report.Helicopter development is likely to be showing commercial results from1950 onwards, and the Committee has noted that six types of helicopter of differing-basic layout, each designed to carry 12 passengers or more, are now under develop-ment in the United States. The Committee reserves its judgment on this subject.Recommendations on commercial helicopters will appear also in a later Report.(d) B.S.A.A.The DH106 shows promise for South Atlantic services. Equally, the brabazon III should prove useful. Further developments of these two types, as-well as requirements for a short-range &quot; bus-type,&quot; will be needed for B.S.A.A.(e) To sum up.Replacements for the Bristol Brabazon I, Avro Brabazon III, D.H. 106. andSaro SR-45 will have to be planned in the next short while if we are to keepthe lead we may hope to gain with them. Although British turbine and jet power-units may justly be claimed to lead the world at present, intense activity is pro-ceeding elsewhere,  The Committee intends to report in detail on these matters.Recommendations.23.   The Committee submits the following interim recommendations : Production (General).(a) Production orders (hereafter specified) should be placed for a numberof types of aircraft for which prototypes only are at present under construction.Recommendations for these production orders are made against requirements bythe three British Airway Corporations. The Committee recommends further that:(i) so far as may be just and practicable, guarantees should be obtained frommanufacturers of airframes and engines as to performance, deliverydates and prices; with a sliding scale of penalties for failure to achieveestimates.(ii) arrangements should be made for the manufacturers to produce a specificadditional number of aircraft (if successful) for export markets, with assistance, where necessary, under the scheme mentioned in para-graph 10.Phase One (1946-47).24. (a) Tudor I. This aeroplane should be brought to the stage of operational trials as rapidly as possible so that it may be in regular service overthe North Atlantic by the Spring of 1947-fully pressurised.(b) Tudor II. -Development trials should be pressed forward with allpossible speed so that a demonstration aeroplane could be flown to Australia andSouth Africa as soon as possible. This is probably the only wav of preventingAmerican aircraft from being used by the Commonwealth airlines on Empireroutes.
(c) Sunderland V and Solent.-1he Committee will be reporting separately-on the question of flying boats of moderate size for use generally.Phase Two (1948-49).25. (a) North A atlantic. No competitive British aircraft can be availableto fill the gap occurring in the New York-London services during Phase Two.Although a Panel had been set up to investigate the possibilities of partly fillingthe gap by British aircraft, such possibilities can only be supplementary to theprovision of a number of American aircraft. (See paragraph 6 of coveringminute.)   The provision of such aircraft is a matter for higher policy.(b) Hermes. The development of the Hermes should proceed as quickly aspossible. An order for 25 Hermes I or Hermes II should be placed immediately,of which 5 are a firm requirement for B.O.A.C. and the remainder would be an insurance against the Tudor II not achieving a satisfactory performance on theEmpire routes. If the Tudor II does prove satisfactory these 20 aircraft willbe available for diversion to meet export orders. (The choice between Hermes Iand Hermes II will be made within the next three weeks.)(c) Ambassador. None of the Corporations has at present a directrequirement for the Centaurus-powered version of the Airspeed Ambassador(Brabazon Ha). But this aeroplane is likely to command an overseas market,particularly in its later, turbine-powered form. The Committee recommendstherefore that the possibility of laying down a small production batch for exportunder the procedure referred to in paragraph 10 should be examined.(d) VC-2. Seventy-five of these aircraft are required by B.E.A. and shouldbe ordered. Vickers-Armstrong can be relied upon to plan and tool for production for the export market.     -(e) A.W. Brabazon IIb. This aeroplane is to be a version of the Braba-zon IIb, primarily intended for overseas markets. It affords a valuablealternative to the VC-2, over which it promises some useful improvement. The,design is proceeding and a production order for 25 should be placed, as a pro-visional requirement for the Corporations, and a further 25 should be put in hand for export under paragraph 10 procedure.(f) Concordia. This type is likely to prove valuable for feeder-line work with B.E.A. and foreign operators. Two of the 10 production aircraft now being built by the firm should be ordered immediately for B.E.A., to be followed up at theearliest date, consistent with technical acceptance of the design, -with a furtherorder for 25.(g) Marathon II. An order should be placed at once for fifty Marathon IIswith Armstrong Siddeley engines for B.E.A,, with the object of bringing the typeinto service by the beginning of 1949. In addition, 25 Marathon IIs should beput in hand for export under paragraph 10 procedure. Pending production ofthe Marathon II, arrangements should also be made under paragraph 10procedure for the production of 25 Marathon Is with 4 Gipsy Queen engines for sale to overseas operators. A number of these aircraft are likely to be requiredby companies associated with B.O.A.C.Phase Three (1950 onivards).26. (a) D.ff-106. Work on this aeroplane and on engines suitable for itshould be pressed forward urgently in versions for both the North Atlantic andfor the Empire routes. If successful in performance, in economics, and in production schedules, the DH-106 may well be in advance of competitive types and have valuable export possibilities, including to the United States. TheDH-106 is not likely to be in service on the North Atlantic route before 1951 but every effort should be made to beat that date. B.O.A.C. have stated that they willinitially need eight DH-106s for North Atlantic services plus, provisionally, afurther 12 for Empire services. B.S.A.A. would initially require six. The Com-mittee recommend that the firm should be immediately advised that not less than50 of these aircraft will be required. The Committee feels bound to record that progress on the design of the DH-106 and its power-plant is by no means so far advanced as is commonly thought, and that delays may be experienced.(b) Brabazon, I. Production of the Bristol 167 would be seriously delayedby substitution-of a &apos;&apos; double-bubble &apos;&apos; fuselage. Therefore orders are being placed for the single-decker. Because three aircraft would give insufficient reserve for a daily trans-Atlantic service, a fourth turbine-engined Brabazon I should be ordered, in addition to the prototype with piston engines.(c) Brabazon III. This aeroplane deserves the highest priority. successful operation of Empire routes at the beginning of Phase Three must depend upon it.
The existing Avro proposals with Rolls Royce Clyde engines should be pressed forward, and an initial production order for 50 Brabazon Ills should be placedas soon as necessary to ensure the earliest possible production. A supplementarytype with improved performance should be initiated immediately. *(d) The foregoing recommendations concern types of aircraft now under construction or about to be built. In a later Report, the Committee intends tosubmit recommendations for new aircraft on which planning should be startedwithout delay to succeed the present Brabazon types.Conclusion.27. Recommendations made above cover the production of 376 aircraft of9 types already under development 277 for the three British Airways Corpora-tions and 99 for additional sales thus increasing the total outstanding orders from approximately 580 to approximately 956.These recommendations present a formidable task both to the aircraft andaero-engine industries and to the Ministries concerned. Not the least problem is that of sufficient personnel to complete the requirements on time. In thisconnection, the Committee wishes to record its concern at the inadequate strengthof the technical staffs of both the Ministry of Civil Aviation and the Ministryof Supply.28. Further, if the United Kingdom is to maintain her rightful place in.the World Markets for civil aircraft large and small foreign operators aswell as the three British Corporations, must be served. The only way to achieve this is to create a demand by producing (not merely designing) the right aircraft at the right time. To succeed, risks will have to be taken. Production orders willhave to be placed off the drawing board. Not all the designs in this period of change and new techniques can hope to prove outstanding successes. Thus someNmeasure of duplication of design is prudent.29. The potential market to be won is indicated by the size of the ordersfor aircraft in the United States. There is no reason to suppose that we cannotcompete successfully with the Americans. The Committee is confident that themarket will continue to expand and that British aircraft of merit can achieve-large export sales as well as promoting trade on a wide scale through Britishservices.The Committee therefore submits this preliminary report in the hope thatits initial approach towards a comprehensive civil aircraft programme will be;approved.(Signed) A. H. SELF, Chairman,I.C.A.R. Committee..Ariel House,23rd July, 1946.
