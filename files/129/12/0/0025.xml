(46) 325.29th August, 1946.CABINET.REPATRIATION OF GERMAN PRISONERS FROM THE UNITEDKINGDOM.Memorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labourand National Service.THIS paper deals only with the man-power implications of the repatriation of German prisoners.2. By the beginning of September there will be about 400,000 german prisoners of war in the United Kingdom. No more are to be brought here after that date except for 4,000 German prisoners held in Canada for the Canadianharvest who are due to be returned to the United Kingdom when they can be released. Prisoners on the last working day of July were working for Depart-ments as follows : Agricultural Departments   ...War Office (Directorate of Labour)War Office (Directorate of P.O.WMinistry of WorksAir Ministry ...Ministry of Supply and Board ofBoard of Trade (Timber)Ministry of transport ministry of Food     ......Ministry of FuelCamp Construction   ...(Camp Staff)Trade (General)158,00050,00036,00035,00019,5006,0004,5005,5001,5001,0008,500326,000Note. The total number of prisoners at this time was 394,500 the differencebeing due to temporary unemployment and prisoners awaiting postingon the day of the count, and to wastage from sickness and other causes.3. Departments have estimated their demands for the year beginning inNovember 1946, and these are summarised in the table set out in the annex.It will be seen that these show a seasonal fall during the winter and rise to433,000 in October 1947.4. These estimates may prove to be somewhat excessive. Account has alsoto be taken of labour from the Polish Resettlement Corps which will now begin to be available. As against this there is the estimate of the Steering Committeethat the general pressure of demand for labour next year will increase and thefact that there is no prospect of an increase during 1947 in the supply of labour available to meet home civilian needs, even assuming that the target increase in numbers engaged on manufacture for export oan be offset by a corresponding reduction in the Forces. It has also to be borne in mind that prisoners of war are used primarily as a reinforcement for the undermanned industries whichfind it hardest to attract labour.5.   There is increasing evidence that the prisoners are not now workingso well as formerly and this decline in output is likely to continue and intensifyunless the prisoners are given some expectation of repatriation.   This is a most[32317]
important argument in favour of an early announcement of some measure of repatriation. Moreover, the announcement must relate to all the prisoners asotherwise there is the obvious danger that the morale of those in respect of whomno announcement has been made will decline even more than if no announcementwere made at all. It will be essential to give them some information as tothe order of selection for repatriation. It is recognised that this order mustbe based on equitable principles and must have regard to the requirements ofthe Control Commission for special types of labour. The requirements of thiscountry for men with particular industrial experience cannot, therefore, beparamount. It is suggested that as a stimulus to good work prisoners miscon-ducting themselves should have their release date postponed.6.   My conclusions are :  (1) It is essential that no risk of failure should be ran in harvesting the 1947crops because of labour shortage. Accordingly we should retain asa minimum the numbers required to ensure this. On the assumptionthat some 40,000 members of the Polish Resettlement Corps will beavailable (this estimate is little more than a guess) and could beemployed on this work (e.g., if Trade Union difficulties can be over-come) the minimum number of prisoners that need to be retaineduntil the end of October 1947 is approximately 215,000 (this includesprisoners required by the Ministry of Food for food processing andthe beet sugar campaign).(2) The maximum number on this basis that could be repatriated up tothe end of September 1947 would then be 185,000 prisoners or anaverage of 17,000 a month assuming that all the prisoners then left in the country could be moved on to harvest work as required.Because for transport reasons alone any repatriation programme mustbe progressive and because of the seasonal decline in agriculturaldemand for labour in the winter, it could be assumed that all departmental demands over the winter 1946-47 could be met underthis maximum programme and its effect on industries, other thanagriculture, would not begin to be felt until next Spring or possiblysomewhat later.(3) If the morale of prisoners is to be maintained, it will be necessary tocontinue the repatriation programme after October 1947 at a steadyrate until all the prisoners had been returned. If this is done, it isobvious that the number of prisoners available for the 1948 harvestwill be very much below the numbers available next year if any remain at all. As there are no means at present in sight whereby thepermanent labour force of agriculture can be increased substantially above its present level, it appears that a decision to begin now arepatriation programme for German prisoners necessarily carrieswith it the implication that substantially the 1948 harvest will&apos; haveto be gathered without any prisoner supplementary labour. Thisis a serious issue to face. On the other hand it is clear that prisonerscannot be retained even for food production indefinitely, and thequestion is whether it is practicable to retain any of them for the1948 harvest. Owing to the winter fall in agricultural demands,most urgent needs for prisoner labour in essential industries could probably be met during the winter of 1947-48 even if repatriationwere resumed in November.(4) If a repatriation scheme is decided on, the major administrative problem from the man-power angle will be to decide how the different Depart-mental allocations should be run down so as to yield the total numbers for repatriation required for the programme decided on. It issuggested that this task should be carried out by the existing Inter-Departmental Committee for the Employment of SupplementaryLabour which has carried out the inter-Departmental allocation ofprisoners of war labour ever since prisoner of war labour became available. In undertaking this task, the Committee should, as atpresent, pay particular regard to needs arising in connection withthe housing programme and to any other authoritative decisions onrelative priorities which may be current from time to time. Should theCommittee be unable to reach agreement, the question at issue couldbe referred for decision to the Ministerial Man-power Committee.
7.   I therefore recommend : (a) that, if politically possible, any repatriation programme on which theCabinet decide should provide for a minimum of 215,000 prisoners to remain here until the end of October 1947, all of whom to be:available for work on the harvest;(b) that, if maximum output is to be secured from prisoners, any announce-ment about a repatriation programme should cover all prisoners andshould lay down some definite order of selection.(c) that the Departmental allocations of prisoners of war labour within anyrepatriation programme decided by the Cabinet, should continue tobe worked out by the Official Inter-Departmental Committee for theEmployment of Supplementary Labour with a reference to the ministerial Man-power Committee in any case where agreement isnot reached.N.
