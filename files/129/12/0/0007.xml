THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOYERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1946.SECEET. Copy No.  3 8CP. (46) 307.29th July, 1946.CABINET.LOCATION OF POWEE STATIONS.Memorandum by the Under-Secretary of State for Air.IN CP. (46) 297, the Minister of Fuel and Power seeks the authority ofthe Cabinet for the construction of power stations at Poplar and a number ofother places. In this Paper I set out the considerations which have led the AirMinistry to oppose on strategic grounds the siting of the station at Poplar.2. Without wishing to anticipate the findings of the Home Defence Com-mittee, I must warn the Cabinet that this conflict between social and economic factors on the one side and strategic factors on the other is likely to be a constantdifficulty in planning the future location of our industry. The case of this power station is the most important which has so far come to notice; but there will certainly be many more.General Strategic Considerations.&apos; 3. In any future war against an enemy who possesses atomic bombs and themeans of dropping them on this country, we shall be exceptionally vulnerable toattacks on cities, and therefore ought to take every opportunity of reducing the concentration of our -industry in big cities, above all in London. Those of mycolleagues who have read D.O. (46) 89 report by the Chiefs of Staff on &quot; future developments in Weapons and Methods of War&quot; will know that, while anatomic bomb dropped on a built-up area would do an appalling amount of damage,at the same time atomic bombs are extremely expensive to produce, and the number in the hands of any potential enemy.would not be unlimited. The greater the concentration of industry within a limited area, the greater would be the incentive to the enemy to aim an atomic bomb at that area. Conversely, the more our industry can be spread, the less would be the damage done to our war potentialby any one atomic bomb.Considerations Particularly Affecting Poplar.(a) War Potential.4. A power station of the capacity of that proposed for Poplar serving alarge number of industrial concerns is clearly a vital part of our war potential.(b) Concentration.At Annex I is a map showing an estimate of the damage which would be caused by an atomic bomb dropped in the London dock area. Within the arealikely to be destroyed by such a bomb, there are no fewer than 14 gas and electric power generating stations, besides 120 other &quot;key-points,&quot; i.e., targets whosedestruction would represent a definite loss to the country&apos;s war potential.(c) Geographical Location.London, particularly the dock area, is, because of its position and size, an easy target to find and to damage. During the recent war, bombs were dropped on the Borough of Poplar in 78 attacks. 27 V.l&apos;s and 11 V.2&apos;s fell within one mileof the projected site for the power station. The above figures show that Poplar isa likely target whether bombing in another war takes the form of aimed orunaimed attacks.5.   On all the above counts Poplar is, from the strategic aspect, about the worst possible site for a big power station.[32203]to - O \y^\/21
26. At Annex II is a note of the alternative site areas suggested by theAir Ministry. As the Minister of Fuel and Power says, this does not mean that the Air Ministry can say what site would meet the requirements of theMinistry of Fuel and Power; but from a strategic aspect any of the fouralternatives suggested would be very greatly preferable to Poplar.Other Stations Listed in CP. (46) 297.7. I have had a quick examination made of the proposed locations of thefour stations listed in the Annex to CP. (46) 297. I am glad to say that ingeneral these are not open to the same objections. Those in the Manchester andGlasgow areas are well outside the central built-up parts of those cities. Manyof the objections to Poplar apply also to the Bankside Station, but not all, andBankside is an existing station. ^Summary.8. I would urge that very serious consideration be given to re-siting theproposed Poplar station outside the London area. The Air Ministry raisesno objection to the sites proposed for the other four stations.G. de F.Air Ministry,29th July, 1946.
Smaller circle encloses three areas as follows.--(a) An area of radius 3,COO ft. in which allbuildings would be obliterated or totallydestroyed.(b) An area of radius.-. 5.000 ft. less area(a) in which all buildings would bedamaged beyond repair.(c) An area of radius 500 ft. less areas (a)and (b). in which buildings would be      uninhabitable without major repair.2.     Larger circle encloses between itscircumference and that of the smaller circlean area of 15,000 ft. radius in whichbuildings would be uninhabitable withoutminor repair.

ANNEX   II.Suggested Re-Siting Areas for Projected Poplar Power Station.THE following alternative sites for investigation by the Ministry of Fuel and power are suggested by the Air Ministry after consultation with the Home Officeand the Ministry of Town and Country Planning. Sites are in order ofpreference, bearing in mind the principles laid down in paragraph 5 of the paper.All sites are on the North bank of the Thames and ample water supplies would,therefore, be ensured.Sites Suggested.2.   (a) Between Stone Ness and Grays Thurrock.(b) Between Great cold harbour and Purfleet Barracks.(c) Between Tilbury and a point along the North bank 3 miles N.N.E. ofTilbury.(d) Rainham Caves, immediately West of Dagenham.Comments on Suggested Sites.3. The Ministry of Town and Country Planning were asked to comment onthe sites suggested. Their order of preference was as follows, taking intoaccount the Greater London plan : (a) Stone Ness to Grays Thurrock.(b) Rainham Caves.(c) Tilbury to 3 miles N.N.E.(d) cold harbour to Purfleet Barracks.The last-named area is not favoured, since it falls within the Green Belt area.4. Although there are a number of key points in the vicinity of each of thesesites, this apparent disadvantage is offset by two factors : (a) The general level of importance of key points in the vicinity is con-siderably lower than the general level of those within &apos;&apos; atomic range &apos;&apos;of the Poplar site.(b) The key points are much better dispersed in each area.5.   It therefore follows that (a) The areas suggested will be considerably less attractive for bombing,particularly area bombing.(b) The danger of badly-aimed bombing achieving unintentional success ispractically eliminated.
