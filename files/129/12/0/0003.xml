HiTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1946.SECEET. Copy NOiCP. (46) 303.2Qth July, 1946.CABINET.RECIPROCAL  ABOLITION  OF  VISAS   BETWEEN   CERTAIN&apos; COUNTRIES.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I agree in principle with the proposals made by the Foreign Secretary in his paper (CP. (46) 302) in which he proposes to negotiate agreements with foreigncountries to which British visitors are most numerous for the mutual abolitionof the requirement of a visa. Any such agreement will, of course, be limited tothe nationals of those countries but will extend to them wherever they are resident;and I suggest that for the time being at any rate the Governments to be approachedshould be only those in Europe with which travel facilities are readily available,viz., Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Switzer-land and possibly also Portugal.2. In accepting such a proposal in principle I must, however, draw attentionto certain consequences directly affecting my Department and the internal controlof aliens in this country.3. If it could be assumed that all the foreigners who would wish to takeadvantage of the removal of the restriction on travel to this country which theabolition of a visa will entail would be bona fide visitors who could be relied upon to return to their own country or place of residence after a reasonableinterval, there would be no reason to anticipate that any substantial difficulties would be created by the new arrangement. Experience^ however, has made it plain that among the nationals of Western European countries, and particularly among French and Belgians, there are large numbers who by reason of the condi-tion of their own countries as the aftermath of war find it difficult to re-established themselves and are anxious to settle in the United Kingdom where they imagine that the conditions and the opportunities for obtaining work will be morefavourable. The requirement that a traveller must first apply for a Britishvisa has enabled a scrutiny to be made by which the intending settler has been largely eliminated at the outset; but even so there has been a substantial numberwho, having been granted visas and leave to land for some temporary purpose,have after arrival endeavoured to prolong their stay indefinitely, and much trouble is caused in following them up and seeing that they carry out their declaredintention by returning to their country.4. In the absence of the preliminary scrutiny which the visa system affords,it may be anticipated that the number of applicants for leave to land, ostensiblyfor some temporary purpose, whose real object is a prolonged or indefinite stay,will be largely increased.   This will have four consequences First, the examination by the immigration staff of all alien passengers willhave to be more meticulous and prolonged, with the result that the flow throughthe immigration control will be slower and occasions for complaint on this groundwill be increased. Even if it is possible to improve the accommodation at sea and air ports for the examination service so that more immigration staff canbe deployed simultaneously, a considerable time must necessarily elapse beforethe requisite additional staff can be recruited and trained.Secondly, the number of alien passengers who will be refused leave to land(which under present conditions numbers some 30 a week of all nationalities)is certain to be multiplied many times. Some mistakes will be made and therejections will occasionally include some who can at any rate muster influential[32199]
2supporters of their bona fides. Complaints, whether justified or not, are, there-fore, to be expected and the possibilities of creating ill-will may be increasedeven beyond that alleged to result from the difficulties of obtaining a visa underthe present system.Thirdly, the immigration staff may from time to time give the benefit of thedoubt to a traveller who, though his declared intention is to pay a visit only,will in fact do all he can after admission to prolong his stay indefinitely. Inaddition, there will also continue to be large numbers whose&apos;original intention was perhaps to pay a visit only, but who will find reasons for wishing to stayindefinitely and to take employment. The task of following up such cases will fall upon the Police, and with their present depleted strength the process maybe slow;. but the longer it is delayed the more opportunity the individual willhave obtained to establish himself and the more difficult it will be to uproot him.It is to be expected, therefore, that the number of cases in which the removalof unwanted settlers of this kind will have to be effected by means of a deportation-tion order or by the threat to resort to deportation will be largely increased.Finally, the abolition of the visa system may facilitate the entry to thiscountry of some persons with Fascist or Nazi sympathies and associations. Ido not think that the entry of such persons will constitute any danger to our national security and it will, of course, always be possible to remove them bydeportation if they slip in without being detected at the ports. But their merearrival here and their being granted leave to land may give rise to public criticismin the Press or in Parliament.5. I note that the Foreign Secretary asks that the implications of theCabinet decision reached in March last (C.M. (46) 23rd Conclusions) that noactive steps should be taken to encourage tourists during 1946 should be reversed.This is a matter which affects the Departments concerned with the provision offood and accommodation rather than the Home Office, but I may point out thatit does not in itself necessitate the abolition of visas with the countries from whichtourists may be expected. If the policy which I have been following in accordancewith what I understood to be the wishes of my colleagues is to be reversed, Ishall be delighted to issue instructions to Passport Control Officers that visasmay now be granted freely to genuine tourists and holiday-makers.J. C. E.Home Office, Whitehall,26th July, 1946.
