inTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 347.Ibth September, 1946.CABINET.THE UNITED NATIONS AND NON-MILITARY ENFORCEMENTACTION.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.I regret that my absence in Paris has prevented my sending earlier these comments on the Minister of State&apos;s Paper, CP. (46) 341, which I did not seeuntil the evening of Saturday, the 14th September.2. Unless the case is already pre-judged by the discussions at the second session of the Economic and Social Council, I think we should be extremelycautious about linking the Economic and Social Council with the Security Council.3.   The Economic and Social Council is designed to promote (a) Higher standards of living, full employment, &amp;c.(b) Solutions of better international economic, social, health and relatedproblems; cultural and education co-operation.(c) Universal respect for human rights.4. The argument is advanced in paragraph 6 of CP. (46) 341 that&quot;economic warfare&quot; is part of the responsibility of the Economic and social council, because it is responsible for negotiating agreements with special agencies,which might have to assist the Security Council in applying sanctions. Theseagencies, however, as defined in Article 57, are concerned with &quot; economic, social,cultural, educational, health and related fields,&quot; and should not in my view bebrought into economic sanctions, even if the word &apos;&apos; economic &apos;&apos; appears in thatdefinition.5. The Economic and Social Council is one of the few organisations of u.N.O. which has not become involved in power politics; it carries on that sideof the League of Nations&apos; work which was well done and earned the world&apos;srespect, and it would be quite fatal, I think, to run the risk that this organisationalso would share in the general nervousness and mistrust engendered to date bythe Security Council. It is as though the Charity Organisation Society had an open link with Scotland Yard, and still hoped to retain the confidence of theMile End Road.6. The machinery &quot; required &quot; by the Security Council is defined inparagraph 9 of CP. (46) 341. Analysing this : (a) Economic intelligence, designed to find out how to make the shoe pinchhardest as an alternative to, or in addition to, actual hostilities, is a purely military subject. It should be covered by some offshoot of theMilitary Staff Committee, in exactly the same way as Trade division was a part of the Admiralty and the Ministry of Economic Warfarean organ for advising the War Cabinet.(b) Legal questions (normal rights, &amp;e).   To my mind this belongs to theInternational Court of Justice, which is specifically entrusted with&quot; interpretation of treaties, questions of international law, breaches of international obligations, and reparation for new breaches.&quot;(c) Advising U.N.O. Organisations on provisions in international agree-ments, &amp;e, to facilitate the effective application of economic sanctions.It seems to me highly unlikely that any international agreementswill be made containing provisos which one signatory even dreams[32390]
may one day facilitate economic sanctions against itself. If such agreements ;should be- made to-day they would be: argued on a powerpolitics basis (with the normal shouts, threats and walking out) andthe further we can keep the Economic and Social Council from thisatmosphere the better,v h (4) Advice to the Security Council upon its request regarding the niethodsof pressure which might be feasible in particular cases.The words underlined seem to beg the question. -The Chartermerely says (Article 65), &quot;The Economic and Social Council mayfurnish information to the Security Council and shall assist theSecurity Council upon its request,&quot; The Security Council are not likely to ask the Economic and &quot;Social Council where the shoe willpinch the guilty, but more probably what measures could be taken toprevent the innocent from being penalised also. In fact the respon-. . sibilities of the Security Council as such are laid down inArticle 50: &quot; If preventive or enforcement measures against any Stateare taken by the Security Council, any other State .... con-fronted with special economic problems arising from these measures, shall have the right to consult the Security Council withregard to a solution.&quot;That is where the Security Council would probably consult theEconomic and Social Council, i.e., on an errand of mercy, not ofcastigation.(e) Providing any assistance required in the actual administration of enforcement measures.This again begs the question. I am not sure what is meant bythe &quot; administration of enforcement measures,&quot; but quite clearly anysuch administration would be punitive rather than advisory, andwould have to be undertaken by some body of economic experts,expressly charged with that responsibility under the Security Council.7. Only those who took part in the meetings of the Economic and social council in New York can say whether the spirit of the discussions was inconformity with the idea that that Council bears any responsibility for enforcingpeace as well as encouraging it by mitigating the internal causes of war. If thisis so, we may be committed to some such action as the Minister of State recom-mends, but if power politics have not yet found their way into the Economic and social Council, I suggest that we should not take the lead in introducing them.In effect, our policy, I think, should be : (i) To say nothing about blockade, &amp;e, on the Economic and Social Council.(ii) To approach the question of sanctions in relation to the Security Councilthrough the mouth either of our representative there, or of our repre-sentative on the Military Staff Committee, who in any case must have their equivalent of Trade Division at some future date.-   A. V. A.Admiralty, S.W. 1,lQth September, 1946.
