(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERN! IENT)secret P. (46)529 - COPY NOc 3S*50th August. 1946.CABINET&apos;CONDUCT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AFFECTING india with AN INTERIM GOVERN!ENT IN OFFICE_Joint Memorandum by Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and Secretary of State for India_The situation in India makes it necessary toconsider:(a) The extent to which the Secretary of State forIndia will be expected to discharge his statutoryresponsibilities for the control of India?s foreign relations under the existing constitution during theperiod of an Interim Government in India;(b) How the continuity of United Kingdom Foreignpolicy can be maintained under conditions which cannotat present be forecast with certainty.2a     The first part of this paper assumes that an interim Government will be established, that it will accept at any rate a measure of United Kingdom control in the conduct of foreign affairs under the present constitution, and that the transition from UnitedKingdom to complete Indian control will be gradual and orderly.5.     The second part of the paper examines the situationwhich may arise if the assumptions in the preceding paragraph prove incorrect, and makes recommendations witha view to maintaining the continuity of United Kingdomforeign policy despite what may happen in India.4.     Both parts of the paper conclude:(a) that H. M. G. should be ready to maintain and staff from U. K. sources (with suitable reinforcement)Missions in Kabul and Katmandu for the purpose of representing U. K. , as distinct from Indian, interests;(b) that in preparation for an Indian withdrawalof the existing contribution to diplomatic and consularexpenditure in Persia, an Investigation should be madeof&apos; the consular posts in Persia which it will benecessary to maintain and staff by Foreign Service

Officers, with reinforcement from one I. P. 3.;(c)   that a decision in principle should now betaken to assume as rapidly as possible direct controlof, and responsibility for, the Political Resident inthe Persian Gulf, and his subordinate agencies.PART control of India&apos;s foreign relationsunder an Interim Government5.     One of the chief responsibilities of the Secretaryof State for India under the existing constitution isthe control of India&apos;s foreign affairs.   It is now time-to consider the steps which it will be necessary to take in the interim period, in contemplation of an ultimatetransfer of control and responsibility in this field fromBritish to Indian hands, so as to ensure that theIndian members of the Governor-General!s ExecutiveCouncil have the largest possible measure of authority.Thus the issue will be to reconcile the freedom whichmust be accorded to the Interim Government in foreignaffairs with the exercise by His Majesty&apos;s Government,through the Viceroy, of the minimum measure of controlnecessary to secure vital Commonwealth interests.6.     Hitherto the Viceroy himself has held charge ofthe portfolio of External Affairs; he has been advised by a Department staffed predominantly by EuropeanBritish officers,    (It should bo explained that IndiaOsrelations with other Commonwealth countries are handled by a separate Department of the Government of india which has been in the charge of an Indian Member of theViceroy&apos;s Executive Council, and do not come within chescope of this paper).   The execution of policy has been entrusted to a service winch, though increasinglyInclianised over the past twenty years, still contains a great majority of British officers.   There has there fore, up to the present, been no difficulty in securing the recognition of the fundamental unity,under His majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s control, of Britishand Indian foreign policy;7.     Prior to the war, Indian foreign interests werecircumscribed, being limited chiefly to the indian ocean Basin, the Muslim states of the Middle East and central Asia.   During the war, India&apos;s interestswidened to embrace not only Far Eastern and s. E. asian countries, but also the U. SoA0 and Africa,8.     An Indian political leader will now, as a memberof the Interim Government, hold charge of the external affairs Portfolio, and will, in pursuance of the public statements made by theGovornment Including paragraph 10of the statement issued by the Cabinet Mission on 25th .

May 1946 (Command 6835) be given &quot;the greatest possiblefreedom in the exercise of clay to day administration ofIndia&quot;.   The position is set out clearly in the Viceroy5sletter to Maulana Azad of 30th May last (Command 6861,item 4) paragraphs 3-5 of which run as follows&quot;3.   I am quite clear that I did not state to you that the Interim Government would have the same powers as a Dominion Cabinet.   The whole ConstitutionalDositionis entirely different.   I said that I was sure .that His Majesty&apos;s Government would treat the newInterim Government with the same close consultation and consideration as a Dominion Government.4.   His Majesty1 s Government have already saidthat they will give to the Indian Government thegreatest possible freedom in the exercise of the day today administration of the country; and I need hardlyassure you that it is my intention faithfully to carryout this undertaking.5.    I&apos;am quite clear that the spirit in which theGovernment is worked will be of much&quot; greater importance than any formal document and gaurantees.   I have nodoubt that, if you are prepared bo trust me, we shallbe able to co-operate in a manner which will give india a sense of freedom from external control and willprepare for complete freedom as soon as the newConstitution is made.&quot;Many of the leaders, especially of the Congress Party,and Pandit Nehru in particular, have well-defined viewson this intriguing branch of administration; with alack of experience in this field, and an impatience tocarry out ideas formed in conditions of irresponsibilitythey may be expected to pursue what they conceive,against a narrow background, to be an appropriate lineof policy without regard for its wider implications,notably the fundamental unity of the British commonwealth in which India must, at least during this period, continueto participate.9.     It is impossible to define in advance how theseCommonwealth interests might be affected and what steps would have to be taken in any given case to safeguardthem.   They may, however, be broadly described as including:-(a) the observance of treaties with foreign powers&apos;. entered Into by E VI G. in the U.K. as the Powerresponsible for the foreign relations of India;(b) the avoidance of any prejudice to H. M. G. &apos;relations with foreign powers, especially the moslem States of the&quot;Middle East;

(c)   t/liG security of British strategic interestsin the Indian Ocean Basin,10. as examples of the possible methods by which.our interests under these three heads might be affected we&quot;would instance the following:(a)   utie handling of tribal affairs in the. NorthWest Frontier of India is inseparable from the   conductof relations with the Afghan Government. whose treaty is with H. M. G. and not India.   A policy based uponpreconceived ideas, without the leaven of a knowledgeof tribal psychology and reactions which can be gainedonly by experience,&quot; is calculated to set up stressesin Afghanistan which would gravely affect relations with .M.G. and might well decide the Afghan Government to seek reinsurance with the Soviet Union.   Failure on thepart of H. II G.  to control.such developments would havea deplorable effect on their reputation for honouringInternational obligations.(b) Emotionalism may colour Indian political leaders&apos; appreciation of the facts and requirementsof India&apos;s true long-term interests in relation to persia and Tibet and may lead to ill-judged decisions on matters relating to those countries which may be gravely embarrassing to H. M. G.  in the conduct of relations with those countries.(c) Sympathy with fellow Asiatics wishing to free themselves from the tutelage of European powers maylead an Indian Interim Government to extend support tomovements in Colonial territories in South East Asia,whether British or Foreign, which claim to be based onthe realisation of national aspirations, without regard to the responsibilities of the metropolitanpowers. &quot; -I!.     Information and consultation will pass from government to Government and through the U. fC HighComiaissioner (to be appointed shortly).   But such control as H. M.G. may fInd it possible to exercise (as distinct from the attempt at persuasion which will bethe only method for one High Commissioner and the normalmethod of the Viceroy) should clearly proceed only through communications passing between the Secretary cfState and the Viceroy,    in particular, it will not bepossible for any control to be exercised, except bythis means, over the instructions sent by the interim government to any Indian representatives in foreign capitals.   A request to establish Indian legations in washington and Nanking (superseding the present Agencies-General in those cities) will follow an the formation ofan Interim Government, and it may be expected that thenew Government will extend the independent representationof India to other countries, though this process may be

impeded by a shortage of trained Chancery staff.12.     In this connection, Indian eyes will first turn to limitrophe countries and appointments todiplomatic posts in .Tehran, Kabul and even Katmandumay be expected to follow at an early stage.   When thishappens, it will terminate the arrangements by whichIndia pays the entire cost of the Kabul and Katmandulegations and staffs them from the I.P. S. , and by which she shares with H. 14 G. the cost of diplomatic and consular representation in Persia.1.3.   with a decision to establish Indian diplomaticposts in Kabul and Katmandu, a parallel decision byH. Mo G. will be necessary to maintain and staff from u, K. sources (which will probably need reinforcements from European members of the I. fe.S. ) British Missionsat these posts.   This will involve the purchase from india, or the construction, of the necessary office and living accommodation.,   al the former, the justification for this is provided in the Treaty with Afghanistan of1921 (which runs in the name of E li G. and the AfghanGovernment), by strategic considerations, and by theeconomic potentialities of the country.    (It is relevant to observe that, apart from the limitrophecountries, the U. S. and French among other Governmentsmaintain Legations there).   At the latter, apart fromTreaty obligations, the necessity arises from H..M..G. rsintention to recruit Gurkhas for the Imperial Forces.14.     The termination of the arrangement by whichIndian revenues contribute half the cost of diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia had been proposed before the War and was deferred at E M,.G. ?request.   It no longer represents the measure of influence on the direction of British policy towardsPersia which India is able to exert.   A renewal of thedemand may be expected to follow very soon after theformation of the Interim Government.15,     The magnitude and character of the interests ofHoM0Go  on the Arab shore of the Persian Gulf (relatingmainly to the protection of oil supplies, the developmentof oil resources and air and sea communications ofincreasing strategic importance as Russian pressure on Persia becomes &quot;intensified) make it necessary thatthe charge of those interests should be in reliable hands and under H. M. G. &apos;s direct control.   We must not risk anyIndian interference with our essential interests inthis area.    The treaties with the Rulers providing forthe external relations of the Sheikhdoms being under british control and for the protection of their territories from, maritime attack, run in the name ofHo IL Go , and their Rulers expect relations to be in thehands of British Officers acting in the name of H.MG.At the same time, it must be recognised that the

severance of the administration from direct provision and superintendence by the Government of India will take time to effect and will also require, as in the case ofKabul and Katmandu, the transfer to service under H. M. G.of a cadre of experienced personnel drawn from british members of the I. P. S. and the purchase, by negotiation withthe Government of India, of the administrative buildions or the construction of alternative accommodation.16.     v/e conclude that any control exercised over an indian Interim Government should in the field of foreign relations be restricted to the minimum necessary tosecure:-(a) the fulfilment of Treaty obligations enteredinto by H. M. G. as the Power responsiblefor the foreign relations of India, and(b) that steps are not taken without H. 1LG. &apos;sknowledge and approval which are likelyto affect H. M. G. &apos;s relations with foreign powers or their essential strategic interests.PART IIContinuity of United Kingdom Foreign_Policy__17.     V/e must also consider the possibility that the interim Government will not prove amenable to thecontrol of the Secretary of State in foreign relations.18.     In such circumstances the overriding necessity willbe to maintain the continuity of United Kingdom foreignpolicy in the relations of foreign countries with Indiauntil.such time as order is restored or until india has finally assumed the conduct of her own foreign policy.19.     The following are some examples of the kind situation which might arise if direct control of Indianforeign policy should prove ineffective or impossible:-(a) India might offer public support to the indonesians against the Dutch and to the VietNamh against the French; (it should not be forgotten that independence movements in Burma.Malava ana Ceylon meat equally be supported byIndian oolitical. .ieaaers).(b) India might demand the return, of Portugueseand French possessions;(c) The lives of foreign nationals - might been dangered, or their economic interests

jeopardised either as a result of measuresintroduced by Indian leaders or as a result ofcivil commotion.20.     In each of the above instances it could beexpected that foreign governments would make representations to EM,G. in the U.K, , in the firstinstance, to whom they would look for both advice andprobably also redress.    It is impossible to devisemethods in advance to deal with hypothetical situations,but it is obvious that in the worst case H. M. G. wouldbe in the awkward position of having responsibility forIndiaJs foreign affairs without being able to fulfilthat responsibility.   They would also have to beprepared to deal with possible third party interventionwith the tL N. 0.21.     All efforts will, however, have to be made tomaintain the 11 K. position as far as possible inlimitrophe countries such as Afghanistan, Nepal,Persia and the Arab shore of the Persian Gulf, for itwill be in these areas that the chief difficulties may beexpected to arise should the control of India?s foreignaffairs prove ineffective.   In some cases, e.g.Afghanistan, it may prove to be physically impossible,in the face of obstructiveness on the part of the indian government, to give full effect to PL, J:L G. &apos;s policy as hitherto conceived.22.   We conclude therefore:-(a) That H. M. G. in the U. K. must be ready to dealas they arise with questions relating toforeign affairs which may result fromunwillingness of an Interim Government in Indiato accept control or from a state of chaos.(b) That H. M, G. must be ready to set up its ownestablishments in limitrophe countries atthe shortest notice.   The steps required tobe taken are shown in paragraph 4 above.P.
