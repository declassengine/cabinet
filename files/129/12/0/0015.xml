(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S.   GOVERNMENT) -secret P. (46) 51551st July, 1946 COPY NO    3&amp;&apos;cabinet india: POLITICAL SITUATIONMeiiorandum by the Secretary of State for india by direction of the Prime Minister l circulate for the consideration of the Cabinet a draft telegram tothe Viceroy (Annexure III) regarding the policy to beadopted in the light of the withdrawal by the muslim league of their acceptance of the Cabinet Mission&apos;sStatement and of the Viceroy&apos;s interview with Nehrureported in telegram No.1579 S (Annexure I).   Theposition was discussed in the India and Burma Committeetoday and. the draft is generally on the lines therea greed upon.2. The operative part of the Muslim League&apos;s resolution of 29th July is as follows:-&quot;The Cabinet Delegation and the Viceroycollectively and individually have stated several timesthat basic principles were laid down to enable the majorParties to join the Constituent Assembly, and that thescheme cannot succeed unless it is worked in a spiritof co-operation.   The attitude of Congress clearly showsthat these conditions as a precedent for the successfulworking of Constitution-making do not exist.   this fact, taken together with the policy of the BritishGovernment, of sacrificing the interests of the Muslimnation and -some other weaker sections of the peoples of India, particularly the Scheduled Castes, toappease Congress, and the way in which they have been going back on their oral and written solemn pledges andassurances given from time to /time to the Muslims, leaveno doubt that in these circumstances participation of theMuslims in the proposed Constitution-making machinery is frouglit with danger, and the Council therefore herebywithdraws its acceptance of the Cabinet Mission&apos;sproposals which was communicated to the Secretary ofState by the President of the Muslim League on June 6,1946&quot;.While this does not finally close the door oncooperation by the Muslim League in the ConstituentAssembly if new assurances were forthcoming that itwould be worked in a spirit of cooperation by congress and in accordance with the intentions of the Cabinet

Mission, it clearly makes it virtually impossibleunless such assurances are forthcoming.   It will beseen from the Viceroy&apos;s recent interview with Nehru thathe did not respond to a suggestion that the Congressshould give some assurance to the Muslim League.   Onthe contrary he indicated the intention of congress to have the Statement of 16th May interpreted by thaFederal Court and to set up a Committee to discussthe implications of the Union subjects.   Neither ofthese propositions is likely to produce a modificationof the Muslim League position.3.     as regards the Interim Government, Mr. Jinnah inhis speech to the Muslim League Council againreiterated that the Muslim League could not agree toa Muslim being nominated by the Congress to the ExecutiveCouncil.   It is therefore unlikely that he can now be induced to accept the proposition which the Viceroyhas put to both parties for an Interim Governmentconsisting of six members nominated by Congress, fivenominated by the Muslim League, and three Minorityrepresentatives, on the basis that either party cannominate anyone irrespective of community.4.     The India and Burma Committee felt that notwithstanding Muslim abstention we must proceed both with the Constituent Assembly and with the interim government, if necessary without the Muslim League.After consultation with the Prime Minister by telephone a telegram (Ahnexure II) was sent to theViceroy today asking him to see Mr. Jinnah and endeavour once more to induce him to come into the interim Government on the proposed basis.   The viewof the India and Burma Committee was that if Mr. Jinnahdeclined the Viceroy should send for Pandit Nehru and form an Interim Government with the Congress andMinority representatives, filling the Muslim seatswith Muslims chosen after discussion with pandit nehru.   The draft is in accordance with thisdecision.5.     As regards the Constituent Assembly, the India and burma Committee felt, and I agree, that we are virtuallybound to convene it and allow it to proceed withoutthe Muslim League if they will not come.   In thecourse of the negotiations in Delhi Mr. Jinnah askedfor and received an assurance in the following terms:-&quot;We (the Cabinet Mission and the Viceroy) do not propose to make any discrimination in the treatmentof either party and we shall go ahead with the planlaid down in the Statement (of May 16th) so far as circumstances permit if either party accepts, but we hope that both will accept&quot;.This assurance has since been published.   Apart fromthis it was stated by the Prime Minister in the House- p -

of Commons on the 15th March that we could not allow a minority to stand in the way of the progress of themajority.6.     The decision to proceed without the muslim league is undoubtedly a grave one but I can see no practicable alternative,   we cannot carry on for any length of time with an official Government without serious trouble, both economic and political.   Onthe other hand, the Muslim League are threateningdirect action at some future unspecified date if circumstances require it and they might regard eitheror both of the steps now proposed as providing theoccasion for it.   If the Constituent Assembly meetswithout the Muslim League there appears to be nothing to prevent a decision being taken within the termsof the Statement of May 16th which would make it unnecessary for Provincial representatives to meet in sections.   Paragraph 19 which lays down this procedure can be varied if a majority of bothcommunities are in agreement.   As a majority of the muslim representatives would, in the aosence of the muslim League, be pro-Congress Muslims such adecision is not impossible.   The result would be thatthe Provincial constitutions of the Muslim provinceswould be framed by a predominantly Hindu body and the possibility of Groups being formed would be veryfaint indeed.   Further, the Viceroy would have an interim Government containing a large Congressmajority and it would be exceedingly difficult for him to resist any decision which it took.   We mustnot disguise the fact that if the Muslims were to resort to violence we should inevitably be involved in supporting a predominantlyCorgressGovernment in puttingdown the disturbances.P. -L.INDIA OFFICE,31 ST JULY, 1946.

ANNEXURE ICYPHER TF,TEORA j FROM VICEROY, daiiad 50th July. 1 946IMMEDIATENo. 1579-S.    30/7I saw Nehru today.     He was friendly but subdued.2.     I said the resolution of the Moslem League had changed the situation since we last met.     I thought hewould acknowledge that resolution was partly a reaction from unguarded language used by Hindu and other congress leaders since meeting of A.I.C. in Bombay.     It would be most unfortunate if League did not join ConstituentAssembly since it would be impossible to frame completeconstitution without Moslems.     Congress now has a chanceof showing real statesmanship by giving League assuranceswhich would bring them into Constituent Assembly.     Nehrusaid he did not see what assurances could be given.Assurance of Pakistan could certainly not be given. I said principal grievance of League was the feeling that group system would not be given a fair chance.3.     Nehru then began discussing legal interpretation of various parts of statement of May 16th.     I said Iknew what the intentions were of those who drew up the document and it seemed to m,; to be pure casuistry to try to force different interpretations out of it.Nehru said that Congress hod intended, to refer points of interpretation to Federal Court and not to force them through by weight of votes.4.     I said we were pledged to go ahead with ConstituentAssembly as far as circumstances permitted but I didnot see how without Moslems we could get much further thana constitution (corrupt group) (? minus) a group ofprovinces.     Nehru said the intention of Congress hadbeen to form a committee of all parties at first meetingof Constituent Assembly to discuss implications of Centralsubjects, not to extend them, In order to give the groupsa basis on which to work.5.     I said I was still anxious to form an interim govern-ment as soon as possible but that it was impossible to go beyond the assurances given in letter of May 30th to Azad,and there could be no question of an &quot;independent&quot;Government whether the League took part in it or not.Nehru made no comment.6.     I told Nehru I should be likely to see him as soonas possible after the meeting of the forking Committeewhich takes place at Wardha on August 8th.

ANNEXURE IICYPHER TELEGRAM FROM Secretary of State to Viceroy..._dated 31st July. 1946_1IMMEDIATE14078.Your telegram 1579-S of 30th July,My colleagues and I have considered Muslim Leagueresolution and your telegram under reference. V/e havealso consulted Prime Minister by telephone.2.     We feel that there are great dangers in our losing-the initiative at this stage, and that it is impossibleto allow Jinnah&apos;s non-cooperation to hold up progress   &apos;with formation of an interim Government.3.     V/e therefore wish you to see Jinnah as soon aspossible and press him even now to allow members ofMuslim League^to enter Interim Government on the basisyou have proposed.      If there is any prospect of hisagreeing you&quot;will have to explain to him that this willrequire Congress agreement in view of reversal byMuslim League of their acceptance of long term plan.4.     If Jinnah should say that he would be willing tocome in you. ^would then have to put it to Nehru that,even though League are no longer-acceptors of Statementof May 16th, it is of overwhelming important to havethem in Interim Government and seek his agreement toproceed on that basis.5.     Attitude taken up by League clearly creates amost dangerous situation.      But we cannot allow ourselves to get into position in which Muslim league and Congress are both in opposition and Governmenthas to be carried on by officials indefinitely.      Ishall be sending you a further telegram after consulta-tion with full Cabinet tomorrow as to further courseof action to be taken if Jinnah declines to come intointerim Government or to allow members of muslim league to participate in.any way in work of ConstituentAssembly.

ANKEXURE IIIDRAFT TELEGRAMFrom:   Secretary of State,To:      Viceroy.MEDIATEYour telegram 1579-S and my reply No. 14078dated 51st July.2.     Cabinet have considered today (prime Ministerreturned from Paris to preside).3.     V/e cannot of course feel any great hope thatJinnah will after attitude adopted at Bombay belikely to come into Interim Government on conditionsyou have proposed and we have therefore givenconsideration to general line of policy to beadopted assuming that Jinnah cannot be induced tocome into an Interim Government and Is intending, aswe assume from resolution, to direct Muslim Leaguerepresentatives to stay away from ConstituentAssembly.4.   As regards Constituent Assembly it seems tous that we are bound to convene it and let itproceed without Muslim League if they do not attendin view of assurance given in your letter of 4thJune to Jinnah which has been published that if one party accepted long term plan we would proceedwith it with them as far as circumstances permit.But clearly if Muslim League were absent wholeprocedure for meeting in sections might be/varied

varied without departure from terms of statement since majority of Muslims attendingwould be supporters of Congress.5c     If as a result of your interview with Jinnahit becomes clear that Muslim League will not come in on basis proposed in your letter of 22ndJuly we consider we must proceed to form an interim government without Muslim League and we thinkthat you should send for Nehru and say that as the muslim League are unlikely to cooperate on basisof your letter of 22nd July to him and to Jinnah,you wish to form an Interim Government inconsultation with him on the same general basis as you have already proposed.   You would ask himto nominate the six Congress members.   Asregards the five places reserved hitherto forthe Muslim League vve suggest you should saythat -you consider that they must be filled byMuslims but would discuss the names with him,and would also discuss with him the names forthe three minority seats.6.     No doubt it would be necessary in thesecircumstances to include one or two NationalistMuslims in Muslim quota.   But we think you should try to secure three and if possible fourindependent Muslims and we should not excludeofficials such as Hydari if you cannot get/independent

independent Muslim politicians.7.     tie recognise of course the dangers of this step but it seems to us out of the question tocontinue with an official Government and that only a Government with wide popular support can hope to deal effectively with the strikes andother economic difficulties which are nowthreatened.
