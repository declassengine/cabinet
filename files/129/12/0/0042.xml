DOCUMENT  IS TEE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO.CABINETREPATRIATION- OF GERMAN PRISONERS OP war memorandum by the Lord Privy seal.      The following were among the Cabinet fe Conclusions whenthey discussed the repatriation of German prisoners of war on Hth September&quot;&quot; * -&quot;(3) The rate of repatriation from the United kingdom should be 13,000 a month until further notice.(h) In view of the local elections to be held inGermany on 15th September and 13th October, thenew policy should be announced as soon aspossible and efforts should be made to repatrla;forthwith as many as possible of the anti-Naziprisoners (&quot;whites&apos;1) now in this country.(3) A detailed scheme should bo worked out for the earlyrepatriation of all other German prisoners, exceptsenior officers and ardent Nazis (&quot;blacks&quot;) for whose return no provision should yet be made.This scheme.should provide for the earlierrepatriation of men whose early return to theBritish Zone of Germany was required on political or economic grounds and of those whose earlyreturn-could be  justified by family circumstancesor on other compassionate grounds.      Subject tothese priorities, release should be by groupsbased on length of captivity.(6) The scheme should include provision enabling german prisoners to volunteer for continued employmentin this country on modified terms.&quot;2.      The Cabinet also asked me,    with the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War and the Parliamentary Secretary tothe Ministry of Labour,  to superintend the preparation of a detailed scheme of repatriation on the above lines and tosubmit it to them for their approval with a draft of a publicarm council e me n t.x C .M.(h6) 79th Conclusions, Minute l)03(46) 3431OTHSEPTEMBER,  1946

-    1903.      They also asked the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Statefor War &quot;to arrange for a Committee of officials representingthe Departments primarily concerned to .consider what further relaxation of restrictions or amelioration of conditions(including increased pay) could he authorised in order toprovide incentives for those prisoners who were to he retained in this country for a substantial further period of employment.&quot;A report from this Committee was to he available for considerationby the Cabinet at the same time as the draft announcement aboutthe repatriation scheme.h.      The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War,  theParliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour and I have held two meetings,  and meetings with officials have also beenheld.      I now attach the following documentsAnnex I   ( page 5)    -   An outline scheme,  drawn up by aCommittee of Officials,  for the repatriation of all German prisoners of war in the UnitedKingdom excluding senior officers and ardentNazis (&quot;blacks&quot;).Annex II   (page 8)    -   A report by another Committee of officials on inducements to good work.Annex III   (page 15)    -   The draft of a public announcement.5*      Annex I.      The repatriation scheme is self explanatory.The only point to which we need invite attention is paragraph 6which deals with the proposal that prisoners might volunteerfor continued employment in this country on modified, terms.On looking into this we agree with the officials that there might be difficulties in retaining prisoners on. terms somodified that they had to be separately housed from otherprisoners.      Moreover,  the retention of volunteers will causeno immediate net gain in the numbers available for work inthis country,  for,  if repatriation is to continue at the rate9

of 13,000 a month,  others will he repatriated, in place ofwho volunteer to-stay.     We should only gain in numbers when all who wanted to go home had in fact done so, and that will not befor many months.6.     Accordingly,  we recommend that prisoners should be permitted to defer their repatriation for periods of size months at a timebut that, for the present,, no special inducements should be givento them to do so - though they would,  of course, be able to benefit from the &quot;good work output bonus&quot; which, we propose below.7-      Annex II.    Inducements.      The Official committee&apos;s report,which is rather long,  is summarised in paragraph 19 (page 13).It recornmends ; -(a) Some improvement in ration scales.(b) An Issue of two bonus cigarettes a day.(Ministers agreed to this some months ago but ithas been delayed by administrative difficulties and   is only now about to be put into effect).(c) An improvement as possible in the quantity and range of articles in canteens.(d) A &quot;good work output bonus&quot;.(e) An assurance that their accumulated cred.itbalances will be paid to prisoners in reichsmarkswhen they are repatriated.(f) An arrangement whereby limited amounts from the credit balances of prisoners remaining in thiscountry can be transferred to Germany for thebenefit of their families and dependants there.(g) Before effect can be given to these last two recommendations a rate of exchange must be fixed.This should be done at once.      There must also bediscussions with the authorities in the otherZones.      These should be started forthwith.(h) The authorities should consider whether there could not be some further relaxation of restrictions on the personal freedom of prisoners.

8.     We agree with these recommendations.     As regards (d), wethink that the :good work output bonus&quot; might amount to an additional5Cfo of the normal week&apos;s earning.      As regards (f),  it is very desirable  from the point of view of improving prisoners&apos;  moralethat they should be able to transfer money to Germany for thebenefit of their families  and dependants, but there is thedifficulty that it is not desirable to inject more money than canbe avoided into the German   economy without any increase in thegoods which that money can buy.     We suggest that prisoners might be allowed to transfer up to, say, 5/-- a week,  the balance of any sums standing to a prisoner&apos;s credit being accumulated forhanding over to him in reichsmai&apos;fcs on his repatriation.9.      Annex III.     The draft announcement.      No comment isnecessary.      In view of the local elections to be held inGermany on Sunday next,  15th September,  the  announcement shouldbe issued at once.10.

OUT LIKE SCHEME FOR Till REPATRIATION OFGERMAN. PRISONERS OF WAR IN THE UNITED KING-DOMReport by the Committee of officials.      In formulating their recommendations,   set out below,for an outline scheme to cover the repatriation of all german prisoners of war in the United Kingdom exceptsenior officers and those classified as &quot;blacks&quot;, theCommittee have followed closely the conclusions of the79tia (46) Meeting of the Cabinet held on 4th September, 1946,Attention is, however,  invited to the special recommendations regarding Conclusion (6)  of the Cabinet i, e.  provision toenable &quot;German prisoners to volunteer for continuedemployment in this country on modified terms&quot;  (para.  below).2.     The Cabinet indicated two requirements:-(a) An immediate plan to repatriate, before the13th October,   as many as possible of the anti-Nazi prisoners (&quot;whites&quot;)  now in thiscountry.(b) A detailed scheme for the repatriation of -all other German prisoners,  except senior officers and ardent Nazis.3.      The number of &quot;whites&quot;, who can be repatriated bythe 13th October,  is determined by the time required to nominate,  collect and &quot;process&apos;  th* individual prisoners and by the availability of shipping.These &quot;white&quot; prisoners are nearly all employed inkey jobs and the Committee agreed that the minimum timefor their replacement must be allowed.    The first batch canbe made ready to embark on 26th September.A shipping lift of 500 a day on the Hull-Cuxhavenroute will enable 8,000 to reach Germany by 13th October.The Committee considered that the regular arrival of500 a day for sixteen days up to 13th October should,  ifsuitably publicised in Germany, be convincing proof ofour intentions to carry out the progressive repatriation of prisoners of war indicated in the public announcement.To avoid withdrawing more key personnel in October,  whenall available prisoners will still be required, especially by agriculture,  it is recommended the repatriation quota for that month be completed after 13th October with permanentsick of which there  are  still a number to be disposed anda number of timber workers and miners.    Instructions for thepreparation of the 8,000 &quot;whites&quot;, referred to above, havebeen issued.

k.      The long term scheme for the repatriation of allother eligible prisoners of war,  as from 1st Novemberat,   (for the present)   a rate of 15,000 a month must provide for the following categoric si-Re quired on political grounds11 &quot; economic groundsCompassionate casesGroups based on length of captivityThe Committee considered that in arranging monthlyquotas,  the Control Office should first be invited to putforward their requirements on political or economic grounds.At present these are the remainder of the &quot;whites&quot;,  timberworkers coal miners and volunteers to work in the coal mines.A regular allotment of not more than 500 should be made each month for compassionate cases.    These would,   at the start, befor the British Zone only but the scheme would be extendedto other Zones,  if possible.    All such cases would be recommended by the Control Commission in Germany (the methodof the selection of such cases has already been discussed andprovisionally agreed).    The balance  thereafter required tocomplete the total of 15,000 for the month would be found from the  &quot;length of captivity&apos;  groups..Steps have been taken to obtain information about thenumbers whose homes are in other Zones.    It will then benecessary to ascertain the numbers and. rate of acceptancefor each.5.      The Committee considered whether it should recommendany other qualifications which should count towards earlyrepatriation,  such as consistently good work or exceptionallymeritorious acts.The conclusion was reached that it would be difficultif not impossible,  to devise a fair method of certifyinggood work and it was considered it would be preferable topenalise those whose work was not satisfactory by deferringthe date of their release.    The reward for good work couldmore conveniently be  left to some form of financial recompensewhich it is understood the Committee dealing with theCabinet&apos;s Conclusion (10)will recommend.Prisoners of war noted as having performed gallantor meritorious acts can be dealt with as individual caseson their merits.The Committee did,  however,  feel that prisoners convicted of habitual misbehaviour    absence,  slackness at work andother crimes cannot be p emitted, to have an equal claim for repatriation with their comrades who have been in every waysatisfactory during captivity and recommend camp commandantsshould be empowered to relegate such men to later groups.6,      It is considered that an unknown number of prisoners willbe glad to postpone their release either because they arewithout ties in their own country or because  they are unwilling to return to certain Zones in Germany at present.It is therefore recommended that they should be permitted to defer their release,  for periods of six months at a time,always provided their camp commandant recommends it.

-In this connection, Conclusion (6)  of the Cabinetrequired provision made to enable such volunteers toremain &quot;on modified terms&quot;.The Committee took this to mean that these volunteersshould be granted special considerations,  as was donein the case of the Italian &quot;co-operators&quot;,  who were paidin sterling, wore uiipatchod dress and were permitted tobe out of camp,  in their spare time, up to a radius offive miles.     In the case of the Italians this presentedno serious administrative difficulty as the great majorityco-operated and could be kept in separate camps.It is unlikely that the Germans will volunteer ingreat numbers,, whatever the inducements. It -would seemimpossible to keep such men, enjoying spec ia1 priviIogos,in the same camp as ordinary prisoners of war,  whilst to concentrate them would cancel their value to employingdepartments,who,  for the most part,  would require them tobe widely distributed.The Committee therefore wishes to recommend thatany question of granting special or modified terms tosuch volunteers should be postponed until the response to an invitation to defer release under existing conditions,ameliorated as may be decided under the cabinet conclusion (10)  is apparent,7,      To sum up,   it is recommended the Cabinet be invitedto approve the  introduction,  after the repatriation ofthe special quota of &quot;wnites&quot;  in September and October(Para,   3 above)   of a scheme,  of which the following isan outline(a) Scheme to come into operation from 1st November, I9h6,(b) Rate of repatriation 15,000 a month until further notice.(c) Monthly quotas to be selected from the following(i)    Priority categories - Those required in british zone for political or economic reasons.(ii)    Compassionate cases (monthly allotment)(iii)    Other prisoners in &apos;length of captivity&apos;  groups.(e)    Qualifications for early repatriation to be- confined to those set out in (c)  above but prisoners whoseconduct and work is uns a t i s fact or y may berelegated to later groups.(e)    Prisoners may be nermitted to defer release for periods of six months at a time under conditionsapplicable to all working prisoners of wardetained in the United Kingdom.(Signed)    V.  3LOMFI3SLDMajor-GeneralChairman17 ar Office,1 Q) i  

ANNEX IIINDUCEMENTS TO GOOD WORK BY GERMAN PRISONERS OF WAR(Report by an Inter-departmental official Committee)1.      Last May, the Secretary of State for War and other ministers mainly concerned circulated a joint Memorandum tothe Cabinet making certain suggestions for granting&quot;inducements&quot; to German prisoners of war employed in thiscountry to encourage them to put into their work the maximumeffort of which they were capable.      These inducements,  whichwere approved by the Lord President1 s Committee on 6th June&apos;,provided in the main for additional food for prisonersengaged on heavy work (in fact nearly all prisoners are  soengaged)  though the additional food in question had to befound from unrationed articles;    for additional earnings of pay, while maintaining the rates as in the British payWarrant;    and for &quot;bonus&quot; cigarettes, provided the employercertified that the prisoner had worked well.      At the samemeeting, the Lord President&apos;s Committee  took note that theDepartments concerned were endeavouring to re-institute thescheme which operated during the war which enabled prisoners to remit part of their pay to their dependants in Germany:all concerned realised that this scheme would constitute a major factor in preserving contentment among German prisonersof war.    The programme of inducements approved last June hasbeen implemented, except that unavoidable supply delays have held up the issue of bonus cigarettes (though this is about  to commence), and certain not unexpected difficulties have  so farprevented remittances from prisoners to their families inGermany from becoming operative.2.      At their meeting on 4th September,  194-6,  the Cabinet,  in approving in principle the preparation of a scheme for the progressive repatriation of German prisoners in this countryand inviting the War Office and Ministry of Labour to initiateits preparation, also asked the War Office to arrange for officials of the Departments mainly concerned to consider&quot;what further relaxation of restrictions or amelioration of conditions (including increased pay) could be authorised inorder to provide incentives for those prisoners who were to beretained in this country for a substantial further period ofemployment&quot;.      The Cabinet asked that a report on this matter-should be available for their consideration, together with thedraft announcement about the Repatriation Scheme.3.     The War Office accordingly convened a meeting on 5th September, 1946 of representatives of the departments which had co-operated in putting forward the earlierinducements scheme last May.      The following report is basedon the proposals agreed at the official level at this meetingon pth September, although shortness of time has not permittedof its terms being formally approved by the Departmentscone concerned.4.     The official Committee make their main proposals under .the three heads of:-

K)OD5.      It is generally recognised that the food supply situationin this country has not &quot;been improved since Last hay to theextent which would warrant any spectacular improvements inthe diet of German prisoners of war in this country, nor would proposals to  that effect &quot;be likely to meet with a welcome from public opinion in existing c :lr cum stance s.Despite this consideration,  the Ministry of pood do not thinkit impracticable to consider the raising of the caloriestandard of the ration of the working prisoner of war to thatof British Depot troops, though it would not be possible togive the prisoner precisely the  same ration scale, particularly where rationed foods were concerned, and in the latter casesubstitutes which would provide the same total calorificvalue would have to be accepted..      There is no doubt that therestoration to the German prisoners of war of a ration scaleroughly equivalent in quantity and quality to the British home service soldier&apos;s ration (and this is an entitlement ofprisoners of war according to Article  11 of the geneva convention, though public criticism of prisoner of war rationsled to its reduction last year)  would constitute a considerablefillip to the morale of German prisoners, as well as improving their physical condition and thereby enabling them to accomplish a harder day&apos;s work.      The object of the proposal would, however,  be defeated if those items in the British home service scale which are generally in short supply had to besubstituted to any great extent by such foods as,  for example,potatoes - of which prisoners of war are already given as higha proportion in relation to their total ration as is acceptable.6.      It is proposed, therefore,  that the War Office shouldtake up with the Ministry of Pood the question of improving&apos; the ration scale of the working prisoner of war&apos;in this country to the quantity and quality of BritishDepot troops.BONUS CIGARETTES7-      As mentioned in paragraph 1 above,  the  issue to german prisoners of war of two cigarettes a day,  subject to theiremployer&apos; s certificate of good work, was approved by theGovernment last dune.      The Tobacco Controller has met withcertain difficulties in arranging for the supply and manufacture of cigarettes of the quality and brands hithertoapproved for issue to prisoners of war;    but those difficulties have in large measure now been overcome and it is expectedthat cigarettes made up from oriental tobacco will become available in two or throe weeks&apos;   time for the issue of bonuscigarettes to be instituted.      Shortly after the government decision of June last, however, NAAFI represented to theWar Office that, for various reasons connected with thetobacco  trade,  the sources of supply from which they providedcigarettes of prisoner of war brands for sale to prisoners intheir camp canteens wore drying up.      The opgtspt or the issueof the bonus cigarettes would, cl early have failed. If th: r.additional issue were more than countov-balanced by short supply in the camp canteens, and the War Office and theTobacco Controller have, therefore,  taken steps to ensureadditional supplies of the required type of cigarettes forcanteen supplies pari passu with the supplies for the bonusissues.

8.      While the provision of additional cigarettes to german prisoners of war may he expected to have acertain inducement value,  it is suggested that asthe bonus issue approved last June has not yet beentested in this respect, it should &quot;be allowed to operate for a time as originally proposed,  itsinducement value being watched.PAY9. There are several considerations which limit the scope of possible increases of pay to German prisoners of war in returnfor the work which they perform.10.    One general consideration is that much of the effect ofany increase In the earnings of a prisoner of war is lost ifthere are no objects upon which he can expend the extra moneyas he would wish.      So far as expenditure for his ownadvantage is concerned., there are two main ways in which a prisoner might spend, extra money:    first, upon extra fooditems (cakes, confectionery etc.) and articles of the consumer goods type etc. provided in his camp canteens,  and secondly,by accumulating such additional pay in his credit for hisultimate benefit on repatriation.      Suggestions are made onthis latter point later in this report.      On the first point,canteen supplies in prisoner of war camps,  the limiting factorat present and which is likely to operate for some little tineto come is the general shortage of such items which affects thcivil population in this country equally with the German prisonsHowever,  the War Office propose that NAAFI  should be instructed, to improve the scale of articles, both food,and otherwise made available in prisoner of war canteensas soon as the improvement in the general supply position in this country permits.11.    The next point concerns the  actual rate at which theGerman prisoner of war&apos;s work is paid.      The War Office hasbeen so constantly attacked on this score that it may be worthstating again the  grounds for the present rates of working pay of prisoners.      The status of a prisoner of war by the geneva convention is that of a soldier and his treatment should conform to that of a soldier:    this is the essential reasonfor prisoners of war being controlled and administered by a service Department, namely, the &quot;War Office.      The Britishsoldier, when undertaking work outside his normal militaryduties of a kind analogous to that performed by prisoners ofwar in this country,  receives certain Army rates of working-pay laid down in the pay Warrant:    these provide a lower and.a higher rate for different kind.s of work,  though in practicepractically all prisoners of war are granted the higher rateof 1-grl. an hour.      There would, be a double objection to increasing the Army rates of working pay of German prisonersof war beyond, those provided in the pay Warrant.     In thefirst place it would tend, to derogate from the prisoner ofwar&apos;s status as a soldier, entitled to comparable treatment,broadly speaking, with the British soldier where circumstances permit.    &quot;in the  second place, the issue of working pay toBritish soldiers has in fact been discontinued for the periodof the war;    if the Pay Warrant rates ore increased to thebenefit of German prisoners of war the position will be prejudiced, as concerns the rates is suable to British soldiers

&quot;should it be dosir-ed to re-introduce it for the latter.The terms of the pay Warrant have already been stretched tothe extent that, following the Government decision of june last on the previous inducement proposals,  the limitingdaily total rates provided in Article 90p of the &quot;Warrant nolonger apply to prisoners of war, who are now paid for allhours worked,  though only at the hourly rate prescribed inthat Article.      The v/ar Office  would strongly deprecate any departure from this principle as concerns the working payissued to German prisoners of war for the above-mentionedreasons, and they understand that the departmental Treasurysupport them in this view.12.    The working pay received by a British soldier was, itis true, an emolument additional to his normal pay? and theGerman prisoner of war receives no normal daily pay.      Butthe Gorman   Army pay code in war-time provided for the paymentjairect to the German soldier of some small amounts of pocket[money only, his main pay being represented by a directpayment by the German Government to his family andIdependants.      At the present time,  this latter element of[the prisoner of war1 s -pay is represented, in so far asIpost-war circumstances admit of the comparison, by relief$payments made to  indigent German civilians, and whichIcomprise the families of German prisoners of war, wherejjnecessary, among the rest of the German civil population,pile Control Office see objection to re-introducing specialpayments to families in Germany of German prisoners of war,);/hich would place such families in a privileged position inrelation to other German civilians.      In practice,  the &quot;pocketfkonqf&apos; element of a German prisoner&apos;s remuneration is represented by the working pay he can earn from the detaininggovernment.      To the extent  to which it is accumulated by the&quot;prisoner in his credit balance, and. not currently expended byhim, it becomes in principle  the liability on repatriationIpf his own Government,  in accordance with war-time agreementsNegotiated between the British and the German and Italianjrovernments, which have been observed by the Italiangovernment during the period since the close of hostilities.m. departure from this principle in the case of the Germanprisoner of war might have the effect of prejudicing thecontinued acceptance by the Italian Government of thefinancial liability for Italian orj.sone.L-a wh.6pe  repatfiatinh:%0 Italy is now appi-uanhing nnnip] oluoil.13.    It is suggested,  therefore,  that the actualhourly rates of pay of prisoners of war for thework they perform in this country should remainthose laid down in Article 905 of the payWarrant, while continuing the concessionapproved by the Government last June, whereby the prisoner of war is paid for all hours worked,irrespective of tho daily ceiling laid down inthat Article.

1h.    The War Office consider however,  and their view isshared &quot;by all the Departments interested in the employmentof German prisoners in this country, that it is mostimportant to Implement as soon as possible the proposal madeto the Lord president&apos;s Committee when they considered, thematter of inducements in June of this year,  that steps shouldbe taken to rointroduce the system whereby German prisonersof war in this country could remit, during the war,  sums ofmoney from their credit balances to their families in Germany.In present circumstances 5 one of the -major worries of theGerman prisoner is the position of his family in Germany;and it would both help his morale and provide a real induce-raent to harder work if he were able,  from his extra earning;&quot;,to benefit his often hard-pressed dependants in Germany.This question has already been taken up with the treasury and with the Control Commission in Germany.      One of thedifficulties encountered is to secure that the scheme would operate to the benefit of families in all the h zones ofoccupation:    it seems likely that early agreement might hereached as regards the 3 western zones.      It is doubtfulwhether the Pussians would implement such a plan, but thescheme would be worth implementing even if confined to thethree western zones.      Another difficulty which has so fardelayed the scheme is the fixing of an appropriate rate ofexchange,  in view of the anxiety of the Control Commissionto avoid any measure which would increase the clanger of inflation in Germany.15*    But similar difficulties to those mentioned above willbe encountered in working out the machinery for creditingGerman prisoners of war on repatriation with credit balancesaccrued to them in this country:    it scorns evident, however,that arrangements will necessarily have to be made for thepayment of such credit balances when German prisoners of warbegin to return to Germany on a phased programme in-considerable numbers.      Hitherto,  the small numbers ofprotected personnel,  sick etc.  who have been repatriatedhave taken with them a paper certificate of the amountstanding to them in their credit in this country;    hut noarrangements have been made for a payment to the Germanprisoner of war in Germany against this certificate of hiscredit balance.16.    It  is suggested that the War Office shouldbe invited to take up, as a matter of urgency with theTreasury and with the Control Commission, the questionof instituting machinery for the payment to german prisoners of war on repatriation of the amount of the credit balance standing in their names in this country;and that,  at the same time,  such arrangements should provide for the resumption of transfers by Gormanprisoners of war remaining in this country of limitedamounts from their credit balances to assist their families and dependants in Germany,  in pursuance of thediso-ussiohs already begun to that end.17.    Consideration was also given by the Peeting of officials to a proposal put forward by the War Office that an additionalmonetary inducement might be offered to German prisonersremaining in this country in the form of a -&quot;&quot;Good WorkOutput Bonus1&apos;,, which - on a weekly certificate of good work from, the employer similar to that proposer! In the case of

the &quot;bonus cigarette issue - would be credited to the prisoner of war and accumulated in his account against his ultimaterepatriation.     Extending this suggestion,  it might be possible when the supply position is easier in this countryand more articles are available in prloiiser of war campcanteens,  to enable the prisoner to draw upon such  ..xtracredit for current purchases,   ilthougb. the Treasury would be opposed to any appreciable part of this &apos; onus payment becomingexpendable in this country and, therefore,  representing anadditional sterling liability.      Further,  this output bonusmight,  equally with the rest of the prisoner&apos;s credit balance,be made available for the transfers to his family in Germanydealt with in the preceding paragraphs.      The suggestion forthis good work bonus has the advantage of appealing to thetlrri^ty instincts of the German prisoner,  offering him as itwould the prospect of building up an appreciable sura for hisultimate benefit on repatriation,  apart&apos; from the possibilityof his using it to assist his family in Germany before hisrepatriation.      Prom the &quot;War Office angle,  it avoids thedifficulties already explained above of increasing the dailyworking pay given to prisoners of war under the fay Warrant.Its appeal to the German prisoner of war will depend, however,upon the firmest assurance to the prisoner that his accumulatedcredit balance,  including any such good work bonus,   //ill bepaid to him on repatriation,  and this is a further reason why the machinery for such payment should be instituted as early as possible.,  . 18.    It is suggested that a good work output bonusshould be instituted for German prisoners of warwhereby, on a certificate from their employer of goodwork, they should be credited with additional periodicalpayments in their accounts in this country-.    era/ally,consideration might be given to ways of penalisingprisoners of &quot;ear who Were obviously ana deliberatelyslacking in their employment a.The War Office might he invited to discuss th.. detailsof this plan with other Departments concerned.      As it istheoretically the responsibility of eacr. Government, underthe arrangements made between the British&quot;, German and. italian governments during the war,  to reimburse to -prisoners of war of its own nationality any amounts advanced,  credited, oraccumulated by prisoners of war while in captivity, the suraspaid to German prisoners of war on repatriation should bedisbursed in P.eiclisraarks in Germany, such koichsmarks beingwvcie- -available by the Control Commitoion fr*ra G-brmran ii&amp;coijrooo;;19.    Summarised,, the proposals put forward by the hooting cfOfficials of interested Departments are as follows - -(a) &apos; The War Office should take up with the kinistryof Pood the question of improving the rationscale of working prisoners of war in thiscountry to that of British begot troops, havingregard to the substiti tion of additional quantitites of unrationed foods or itemsseasonably in good supply for those items ofv the British soldier&apos;s ration which are at-present in short supply.

The progress of the issue of bonus cigax^ettcc,on the employer&apos;s certificate of good work,ah out to 1:.. instituted,  should he watched as concerns its effect as an ;;inducement&apos;;, witha view to its possible extension.The war Office should pursue with h.
