SECRETCiPiIit61.^2212TH AUGUST, T9h-6FUTURE OP THE ASSYRIANSMemorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for the colonies in his memorandum (CP. (I4.6) 30U) the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs has recommended that the Cabinet shoulddirect that a suitable area must be found in the british colonial Empire for the settlement of the Assyrians.     a pre- -requisite of any decision of this hind must be that areascan be made available in the Colonial territories where these people could settle under concLitions which will enable themto become in due course self-supporting-2,       There are some   20,000 Assyrians involved and althoughthe British Empire includes over 30 Colonial territories, fewoffer any prospect whatever of any settlement of this nature.Some (such as Gibraltar,  St. Helena, the Seychelles) are too small.      In some (for example Cyprus, Mauritius,  the west indies) all available land is already occupied or under cultivation and foreign settlement could, not be undertaken without large scale dispossession.      Many are already over-populated, and faced with serious unemployment problems (e.g.Malta, Jamaica).      Such considerations virtually rule outColonial territories outside Africa, with the possible exception of British Guiana,  to which I refer below.3.       As regards Africa,  it is&apos;a serious mistake to assume that the British African territories can absorb immigrantson a large scale from other countries.      Over wide areasclimatic conditions alone would inevitably involve seriousrisks to settlers from non-indigenous races.      This is    true of West Africa as a whole and:, of large areas in East Africa-.Those parts of East Africa which are suitable for settlement by immigrant peoples are strictly limited, in extent and theareas still available for settlement are comparatively small.A survey of the prospects of settlement in Kenya, for example,have resulted in proposals for an intake limited to some500 families,  and the plans for such immigration as is contemplated provide for preference to British ex-service men.Indeed applicants already exceed the number who can beaccepted.h.        Apart from the physical aspects,  the introduction ofa new community of this kind into any African territory would raise the gravest political issues.      There are already-difficult racial - issues in many of these territories whichwould be enormously complicated, by the introduction of awhole new foreign community.      In East Africa,  particularly,the natives (for whom we. are trustees) are disturbed at theextent of foreign immigration and. are demanding not merelythat no further land should be alienated for foreign settlement,but that some of the land, already alienated should be returnedCOPY NO.CABINET(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)

Illto them.      There con be no doubt that unofficial opinion throughout East Africa would be wholeheartedly opposedto any suggestion of large scale settlement of any foreignpeople,  and the introduction of the Assyrians into these territories would have the most serious repercussions uponthe native races and would shake their confidence in thewhole policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards them.5.        I must confess to some surprise that the suggestion of settling Assyrians in the Colonial Empire has been raised,since it is only recently that the whole question of foreignsettlement in the Colonies was examined colony by colonyin consultation with the Foreign Office in relation to thePoles.      The conclusion reached on that occasion was that theonly prospect of large scale immigration in colonial dependencies is offered by British Guiana, where the highlandsmight be able to provide an industrious people with areasonable livelihood.      Prospects in this respect weresurveyed before the war in connection with a proposal for settling Jews in British Guiana, and on the basis of this surveyit is roughly estimated that an expenditure of about one million pounds would be required to establish and maintain an experimental settlement not exceeding 5*000 persons.      If theCabinet considers that a proposal of this kind should befurther pursued either in relation to the Poles or in relationto the Assyrians I shall of course be prepared to arrange forthe matter to be further investigated in consultation withthe Governor in the light of the conditions prevailing to-day.I have already written to the Chancellor of the Exchequer onthis subject as regards the Poles,  and am awaiting his views.I have a keen appreciation of the claims of the assyrians upon our sympathies.      But I must declare myemphatic view that there is no room for the solution of the assyrian problem by settlement with the Colonial Empire,apart from this possible suggestion in relation to british guiana.G. H.Colonial Office,  S.W.1.,12th August,  191+6.
