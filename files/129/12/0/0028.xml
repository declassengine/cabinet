this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 328.2nd September, 1946.CABINET.INDIAN FOOD REQUIREMENTS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.I circulate herewith a further memorandum on the Indian Food Situationin continuation of the memorandum considered by the Cabinet on the 14th August(CP. (46) 323 of the 10th August). In spite of every effort which has been made during the last three weeks to tap new sources of supply and to expedite ship-ment of cereals to India there will still be a gap on present estimates of153,000 tons during September and October between supplies at present in sightand what would be required to maintain an average of five weeks&apos; working stocks in India. I would draw the particular attention of my colleagues to paragraph 3of the memorandum which describes the grave view which the Viceroy takespersonally of the situation which may arise in India. What is at stake is notonly the lives of millions, but also the whole of India&apos;s political future and her relations with the British Commonwealth.2. The main possibility which I see of making any further contribution towards tiding over the most critical period in India up to the end of October,after which with the cessation of the monsoon internal procurement in Indiamay be expected to improve, would be to divert to India, say, 100,000 tons ofwheat out of September shipments from Canada at present destined to the UnitedKingdom. I fully realise the political and other difficulties of any such decision in present circumstances, but a famine in India would have such grave conse-quences that I must ask the Cabinet to consider most seriously whether apartfrom any humanitarian considerations this would not be the wisest course totake from the point of view of this country&apos;s own long-term interests. I needhardly point out the political impossibility of taking any steps in the directionof abolishing bread rationing or of reducing the extraction rate in the UnitedKingdom at a time when millions in India may be faced with starvation.3.   I also suggest: (a) That His Majesty&apos;s Embassy, Washington, might be instructed to suggest to the United States Government the desirability of their making as large as possible an allotment of cereals to India for October ship-ment from the United States.(&amp;) That the Official Committee on Food Supplies from South-East Asiamight be asked to consider the question of the shipment of rice from burma to China, U.N.R.R.A. and the Philippines with a view to pressure being brought on the I.E.F.C. to acquiesce in all supplies available from Burma in September being divided between India andother territories within our responsibility as an emergency measure.P.-L.India Office, S.W. 1,2nd September, 1946.[32345]b
Indian Food Situation.The stocks of cereals likely to be available to the authorities in India for meeting the ration in the deficit Provinces and States are estimated to be asfollows, on the basis of up-to-date information just received from the Governmentof India.and of the latest estimates of arrivals of cereals from abroad up tothe end of November as shown in the Appendix to this Paper. The figures arein thousands of tons.Opening       Internal Imports ;   . .stocks at      Supplies duringbeginning during the       the Total Monthly       closing of month.       month. month.

It will be seen from the above that the average of the stocks of deficitProvinces and States will fall to under 5 weeks&apos; off take on the 1st October andto about 4 weeks&apos; off take on the 1st November and again on the 1st December.Though there is some improvement (due largely to earlier procurement) sincethe Cabinet last reviewed the position, the situation remains grave. The Govern-ment of India estimate that an average stock level equal to 6 weeks&apos; off take (about900,000 tons) and a minimum stock level equal to one month&apos;s off take in eachdeficit Province and State are necessary to avoid local breakdowns in rationingarrangements. Owing to the size of India it is impossible to get stocks levelin all Provinces and States and stocks in some of them will fall much belowthe averages quoted above. The Government of India judge that they must expectlocal breakdowns in September, the number&apos;of which will go on increasing as time passes unless larger imports are received. They consider that larger supplies in October may make all the difference between local breakdowns and a generalbreakdown. The danger spots seem likely to be Travancore, Cochin, Bengal andMadras where rice is the staple diet of the population. In order to bring averagestocks up to a level equal to 5 weeks&apos; off take, i.e., one week less than that forwhich the Government of India ask, it would be necessary to ship an additional153,000 tons for arrival in India in September/October, as compared with the523,000 tons estimated in CP. (46) 323 of the 10th August as required to maintainaverage stocks of the equivalent of one month&apos;s off take. If this additional quantity could be provided, the position could probably be held generally andwith the expected improvement of internal procurement after the monsoon, stockswould again rise in November to a safer level. In so far as they cannot beprovided the period of acute crisis will extend into November and December.3. In a personal appreciation of the situation the Viceroy has emphasised the danger of the stocks in the hands of any local administration in India fallingbelow one month&apos;s off take. He points out that the more complete the rationing system the more serious is the result of a failure of supplies because the greaterand more universal is the Government&apos;s responsibility for providing food andthe less is the capacity of individuals to tide over failure of supplies. He warnsus that if a breakdown occurs shortly after the new Indian political Govern-ment assumes power, it is inevitable that the blame will be laid on His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and on the Government of the United States. To the consequentbitterness and recrimination would be added a real danger of breakdown in administration and the creation of a difficult law and order situation at a timewhen the communal position is at its most menacing.4. The Government of India have considered with the Provincial and StateAdministrations at a Conference at Delhi the question of a further reductionin the basic cereals ration of 12 oz. a day. The Conference decidedunanimously against this course on the grounds that the 12-oz. ration is itselfinadequate under Indian conditions, and a further cut throughout India woulddefeat its own object, because (a) such saving as might be obtained would belikely to be offset by a corresponding loss in internal procurement owing to theeffect on public confidence of cutting the ration, and (6) the announcement of afurther reduction would have serious repercussions on labour, and thus involvewidespread dislocation of production and movement, and a serious threat to law and order. Already the ration has had to be reduced locally where it cannotbe met, and this tendency is likely to increase.   Tor example, the ration in
Travancore is at present 4-4-^ oz- Qf rice plus %k oz- 0? wheat, and in Bengal,    135as a result of the dislocation caused by the disturbances, the cereal ration hasbeen temporarily reduced to 6 oz. a day.5. In pursuance of the decision of the Cabinet on the 14th August (Con-clusion 78 (46)), the British Food Mission at Washington were instructed to consult urgently with the United States Government as to the means of tidingover the Indian food crisis. The Mission feared that an approach to the UnitedStates authorities would invite from the latter a suggestion that supplies from north America destined for the United Kingdom, including some of theCanadian shipments in September, should be diverted to India. They, there-fore, seem to have felt that an approach would be inconsistent with the otherconclusion of the Cabinet that for the present there should be no diversions ofwheat destined for the United Kingdom. At the same time the United StatesGovernment have allocated 224,000 tons of United States wheat and othercereals for shipment to India in September, which is much in excess of theamount previously expected. Only one or two cargoes out of this programmecan be shipped in time to reach India before the end of October, but the balancewill provide a helpful addition to supplies in November. Meanwhile, on the motion of the Indian Representative at Washington, a Working Party appointedby the International Emergency Food Council have been examining India&apos;s food position with a view to proposing measures to meet the crisis and have approached the United Kingdom, French, Norwegian, Swiss, U.N.R.RA. and Swedishrepresentatives regarding the possibility of diversions.6. Every effort has been and is being made to tap the other possible sources of increased supplies indicated in paragraph 5 of the Note circulated to theCabinet on the 14th August (CP. (46) 323). The results, which have been takeninto account in the Appendix to this paper may be summarised as follows : (a) Argentine. The Indian Food Mission to the Argentine have been successful in obtaining export licences for 140,000 tons of maize and hope shortly to get licences for a further 100,000 tons already bought.Shipping for 108,000 tons is immediately available and this quantityshould reach India before the end of October. If the necessaryadditional shipping can be provided in time it may also be possibleto ship the remaining 132,000 tons of maize plus 8,000 tons of milletfor November arrival in India.(b) Turkey. 80,000 tons of barley purchased in Turkey by the Ministry ofFood will be available for India. The rate of shipment is limited byinland transport and port facilities. Not more than 40,000 tons canbe expected to reach India before the end of October with a further40,000 tons in November. 20,000 tons of wheat has also been bought inTurkey, but it is unlikely that any of this will be available for ship-ment until about November-December.(c) Iraq. His Majesty&apos;s Government have concluded their negotiations forthe purchase of barley in Iraq. Movement of this grain is expected tobe slow, but it is hoped to ship, say, 8,000 tons for October and afurther 8,000 tons for November arrival in India.(d) Siam and Burma. Lord Killearn has reported that there is no possi-bility of increasing immediate supplies of rice to India from burma and Siam at the expense of claimants in South-East Asia. Indeed,owing to the drying up of procurement in Siam, September shipments to India will be less than were expected.(e) Java.- -The Government of India&apos;s agreement with the Indonesians forthe supply of paddy to India has been signed and shipments have begun. The flow of paddy to the ports would be substantially increased if motor trucks were available to bring it from the fields tothe railways. But there is the danger that the Indonesians would use for military purposes any trucks supplied to them. This dilemmais being referred to the Chiefs of Staff. The Viceroy has given a warning that the new Indian Government may wish to withdrawIndian troops in Java at once unless satisfied that everything possible is being done to move the Java paddy and that the morale of these troops may also be affected if they thought that its movement is beinghindered.[32345]
7. The following means of alleviating the situation seem worthy of consideration : 1(i) Additional shipments of Burma rice to India (vide paragraph 6 (d)above). Owing to the drying up of procurement in Siam and under astrict application of the system approved by the I.E.F.C. for the pooling of supplies from Burma, Siam and French Indo-China among all territories which have allocations from any one of these sources,it is proposed to divide the 75,000 tons of rice which Burma will have available for shipment in September in such a way that China,U.N.E.B.A. and the Philippines will get about 32,000 tons andIndia only about 12,000 tons. Having regard to I.E.F.C. allocations,this would in ordinary circumstances be fair. But it seems question-able whether at the present juncture, when India, Malaya and theAllied controlled parts of the N.E.I. seem likely to be faced with themost serious food crisis, rice should be shipped away from neigh-bouring Burma to more distant foreign territories which we have reason to believe are not so immediately hard hit as our own.It is suggested that the Official Committee on Food Supplies from south-East Asia might be invited by the Cabinet to consider thiscomplicated matter in detail, with a view to pressure being broughton the I.E.F.C. to acquiesce in all supplies available from Burma inSeptember being divided between India, Malaya, and the N.E.I. as anemergency measure and without prejudice to the division of riceavailabilities from S.E. Asia over the whole six months of the currentallocation period in accordance with I.E.F.C. allocations. This mightbe worth about 18,000 tons to India,(ii) The supply of motor vehicles to the Indonesians (vide paragraph 6 (e)above). This might be worth 5,000 tons to India for October arrival(and 43,000 tons for arrival in November and each subsequent month).This is under the consideration of the Chiefs of Staff.(iii) There is a possibility of U.N.R.R.A. diverting against September ship-ments from the United States 25,000 tons in response to the approachreferred to in paragraph 5 above.(iv) The diversion of supplies from Canada or the United States bound forthe United Kingdom. The Canadian harvest this year has beenearlier than usual and it is understood that 316,000 tons of wheathave been programmed from Canada for September shipment to theUnited Kingdom in addition to the usual flour shipments. If, inaddition to these supplies, the United States fulfil their undertaking to ship 456,000 tons to the United Kingdom before the end ofSeptember it is understood that the figure of 1,658,000 tons for May/September shipment to the United Kingdom, which was agreed duringthe Lord Presidents discussions in Washington, would be exceededby about 200,000 tons. The most substantial and reliable of thepossible means of relieving India&apos;s crisis would be a diversion to india of 100,000 tons of wheat destined for the United Kingdom from north america.(v) A generous allocation from the United States for October shipment.We can hardly expect the United States Government, who have alreadyallocated 224,000 tons for India for September shipment, to improveon this. But the position in India in November and early Decemberwill remain difficult, particularly in so far as we cannot fill the gap in September and October, and October shipments from the UnitedStates especially if shipped early in the month would prove very useful, ft would be helpful for His Majesty&apos;s Government repre-sentatives in Washington to reinforce what is doubtless already beingsaid in the matter by the Indian representative. This approach mightsuitably be made through His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washingtonrather than through the British Food Mission. The Indian foodproblem is largely a political question from His Majesty&apos;s Govern -ment&apos;s point of view and an approach through the diplomatic channelmight embarrass the British Food Mission less in their own negotia-tions with the United States Government on behalf of the UnitedKingdom.

At present thereis no prospect of any programme from Australia in October;(b) the August and September oats programmes from Canada;(c) the July, August and September wheat programmes and the August and September flourprogrammes from the United States. Only one cargo of wheat from the Septemberprogramme is expected to arrive in October and the balance in November;(d) the August and September milo programme from the United States;(e) the 40,000 tons of millets and 7,000 tons of barley from Egypt;(/) the 304,000 tons of maize plus some millets from the Argentine (shipping has not yetbeen arranged for 140,000 tons of this, but it is hoped it will arrive in November);(g) the barley programme from Turkey and the first part of that from Iraq;(h) a small amount of maize from Burma.(2) The figures contain some element of conjecture. Arrivals from Australia have been calculated on the basis of dates of arrival for each cargo as estimated by the Ministry of Transport.The other figures have been estimated by allowing for loading time and for six weeks for the voyage from the United States, Canada, Brazil and the Argentine, four weeks from Turkey, threeweeks from Iraq, Siam, Java and Egypt and under two weeks from Burma.
