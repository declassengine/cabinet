SECRETCP. (46) 327 (Revise)30^ August, 1946CABINETREPATRIATION OF GERMAN PRISONERS OF war memorandum BY THE PARLIAMENTARY UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE,THE WAR office. A definite indication of our policy regarding the repatriation of German prisonersof war, and of the period for which it is intended to retain them in this country and throughout the Empire, is becoming a matter of increasing urgency.2. The subject has been raised on more than one occasion in both Houses andpublic demand for a clear cut policy has culminated recently in the Memorial sent toThe Prime Minister by 875 men and women including leaders of the Church and members of Parliament of all parties (copy at Appendix A). There are also indications that labour opinion views the indefinite sojourn of German prisoners of war in thiscountry with some disquiet. Their retention without any definite term is further oneof the main causes for complaints against the British authorities in the British zone of Germany.3. There will be, by the end of August, in the United Kingdom over 400,000German prisoners of war. More than another 100,000 are distributed round the Empire,mostly in Middle East.   Details are shown at Appendix B.4. The morale of these prisoners is deteriorating and there is ample evidence toshow that this is due very largely to their ignorance of their future and to the remoteprospect of any re-union with their families, whom they fear they may never see again.This fall in morale is so far only apparent in a degree of apathy and despondency.Whilst this attitude may result in no more than a limited drop in output among theworkers, the possibility of real trouble and indiscipline cannot be ruled out. This lastwould not only result in a complete negation of their value as a labour force but would present a very serious problem for the military and police forces of the country. the staffs of the prisoner of war camps have necessarily been reduced to administrativecadres owing to the reduction in Army man-powrer. Any serious trouble would have tobe dealt with from outside, but the concentration of sufficient trained troops to dealwith a widespread outbreak of indiscipline would present serious difficulties.5. The relevant paragraph of the Geneva Convention (Article 75) reads asfollows:  &quot; When belligerents conclude an armistice convention, they shall normallycause to be included therein provisions concerning the repatriation of Prisoners ofWar. If it has not been possible to insert in that Convention such stipulations,the belligerents shall, nevertheless, enter into communication with each other onthe question as soon as possible. In any case, the repatriation of Prisoners shallbe effected as soon as possible after the conclusion of peace.&quot;.On the several occasions when the subject of repatriation of German prisonershas been raised in both Houses, Government spokesmen have taken the line that thereis no German Government yet in existence with which discussions could proceed (on thelines of the Convention) in the absence of an armistice and prior to a peace treaty: itwill, I suggest, be impossible to hold this line in future.Permanently sick and those suffering from wounds together with &quot; protected &quot;personnel not required for medical duties in prisoner of war camps, are repatriablecurrently in accordance with the Convention. Insofar as concerns the United Kingdomand our original holdings in North America, the requirements of the Convention in thisrespect have been largely fulfilled. Beyond this, Cabinet approval exists only for there patriation of some 20,000 known &quot; whites &quot;, whose repatriation has up to now pro-ceeded very slowly but which should be accelerated from October onwards.In September the distribution of British shipping will be reviewed to meet world-widerequirements of the following six months. It is essential, therefore, to have an earlyestimate of the number of Germans who are to be transported back to their own country during that-period. &apos;Copy No.   3 5
6. A substantial increase in the rate of repatriating prisoners of war and a firmannouncement of His Majesty&apos;s Governments intentions in this connexion would havepositive advantages beyond the negative ones involved in meeting public opinion onthe subject. Not only has the indefinite retention of German prisoners of war been a grievance against British authorities in Germany, but it has also been contrasted recentlywith the much advertised return of German prisoners of war from Russia. Apart fromthe actual return of prisoners of war, the announcement of a definite and large-scalerepatriation scheme over the next year would have an excellent effect on morale both inGermany and in prisoner of war camps in this country. It would also make the task of&quot; re-educating &quot; prisoners of war in this country much more easy and profitable. this in its turn will ultimately ease the task of British administration in Germany, since itwill provide them with a larger nucleus of reliable Germans, to whom authority can safely be delegated.7. I appreciate that the Minister of Labour had to-bring to the United kingdom from overseas over 200,000 prisoners to meet the demands of labour in this country which could not be met from our own resources. I further recognize that his require-ments for such labour may well be a deciding factor in arriving at the number ofprisoners of war who must be retained here for essential work next year, in particular the harvest.The War Office itself employs some 50,000 German prisoners of war in this countrydirectly on military tasks, as well as a large number overseas. Owing to the rapid run-down of the Army and the continued pressure upon my Department to reduce its civilianemployees, the withdrawal at an early date of any considerable numbers of theseemployed prisoners would cause serious embarrassment and loss of efficiency. The AirMinistry also employ about 20,000 German prisoners in the United Kingdom, and similar considerations probably apply to their case.8. Certain inducements to good work, such as payment for all hours worked insteadof a fixed maximum scale, extra rations and a scheme of bonus cigarettes have been introduced. I have relaxed some restrictions on movement to allow both a widerattendance at religious services and recreation and exercise by certain categories ofemployed prisoners. Nevertheless, unless a decision is soon reached on which a fair and world-wide system of repatriation can be based, this labour force may, for thereasons I have given above, deteriorate by degrees into a liability rather than an assetwhich, in the absence of special shipping facilities, it might prove impossible to liquidateas quickly as would be desirable except by interference with other military commitments.9. It is, I suggest, abundantly clear that the question is one of real urgency andI recommend that no time should be lost in the production of a programme of repatria-tion which can be communicated to the prisoners and publicly announced in thiscountry and in Germany.To enable a programme to be produced, certain policy decisions are required.I have set out below the points on which I suggest Cabinet guidance is necessary before a programme is evolved:  (a) Date by which all British held German prisoners of war should be repatriated.(It may be desirable to exclude for the present a decision regarding senior officers and ardent nazis (&quot; blacks &quot;)).(&amp;) Number of working prisoners still to be available for labour in the UnitedKingdom and overseas at intervening dates (e.g., for the harvest period1947):(c) Whether all anti-nazis (&quot; whites &quot;) must be repatriated from each place of holding before a start is made with those holding no strong political views(*&apos; greys &quot;).(d) Whether, subject to meeting special requirements of the British Zone in Germany,as to individuals and trades, general repatriation should be worked out ona group system, based on age and length of time in captivity.(e) If it is desirabte that an examination should be made to see what further relaxation-tion of restrictions or amelioration of conditions can be extended to thoseprisoners who must still of necessity remain some considerable time in thiscountry.10. I hope my colleagues will see their way, after consideration of this Paper, anda companion one submitted by the Minister of Labour (CP. (46) 325), to give an indication of policy on the five points enumerated above and instructions as to respon-sibility for the production of a detailed worldwide programme of repatriation.11. I attach at Appendix C a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster which sets out his views on this subject.The War Office,30th August, 1946.N. of C.
APPENDIX AMEMORIALTo The Prime MinisterWe are gravely concerned about the position of German prisoners-of-war in thiscountry. Some of them have been prisoners for many years; more than a year has nowelapsed since Victory: but they are still told nothing about the date on which they may expect to be repatriated.  There comes a point at which men cannot live without hope.For the sake, therefore, both of our common humanity and of the British goodname, we earnestly beg His Majesty&apos;s Government(i) to draw up a definite scheme for the release of these men, if necessary by various categories, at the earliest possible dates;(2) to announce this scheme to the prisoners with the minimum of delay, since the certainty of release even at a relatively distant date would be less intolerablethan the present uncertainty.(There follows a list of the Memorialists.)APPENDIX BESTIMATED BRITISH HOLDINGS OF GERMAN PRISONERS OF war as AT 31st AUGUST, 1946United Kingdom       .................. 420,000Middle East     ...................... 104,000East Africa      ..................... 118Gibraltar         ..................... 604Canada           ..................... 4*000Australia         ..................... 1.549(Holdings in B.A.O.R. and C.M.F. not shown.)APPENDIX C.REPATRIATION OF GERMAN PRISONERS OF war memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster i would like to register my strong support of the recommendation put forward bythe Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, The War Office, that a programme for there patriation of German prisoners of war in British hands should be framed and announced as soon as possible.2. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State refers to the position under the geneva Convention, and to the declining morale of the prisoners with a consequent reduction in their value for labour purposes, as reasons for an early decision on their future.   There are other reasons of considerable weight:  (a) The prisoners are badly needed in the British Zone of Germany where there isa serious shortage of able-bodied manpower for coal mining, timber produc-tion and other essential industries.(b) Many are anti-nazi democrats who are badly needed to stimulate the democraticrevival in Germany and to replace the nazi technicians who have had to bekept in employment for want of suitable replacements.(c) Failure to initiate in the near future a large programme for the return of the prisoners will have most serious political consequences in Germany. It willstultify the work of re-education now being undertaken on a considerable scale in the prisoner of war camps in this country and the Middle East sothat in the end prisoners will go back disillusioned and embittered. Hostilitywill undoubtedly be manifested towards us on a growing scale in the british zone. The situation will be made more difficult for us if the Russians fulfil the programme which they recently announced of returning 120,000 prisoners from Russia.(d) It is impossible to plan any programme of education in prisoner of war campsover the coming winter until the broad outlines of a repatriation schemehave been decided.
3- I therefore strongly urge that the Cabinet should agree that the repatriation ofprisoners on a large scale should start immediately after the harvest in accordance with acoherent plan. This plan should be based upon the absorptive capacity in the British zone and upon a clear scheme of priorities, from which the prisoners themselves can get some ideaof their future, and should be departed from only in conditions&quot;of genuine and unforeseeableemergency.   It should, I suggest, be on the following general lines: (i) Repatriation on grounds of political or economic value in the British Zone.   Atpresent, this would include coal-miners, volunteers for the coal-mines and timberworkers. Priority in each group would go to &quot; whites&apos; to be followed by&quot;greys&quot;. The economic priority groups (which could be added to later shouldthe need arise) would be followed by the remainder of the &quot; whites &quot; whose homesare in the British Zone, or who volunteer to return there. Provision would alsobe made for returning &quot;whites&quot; to the other zones. (The U.S. authorities havealready said that they would be glad to receive 7,000).(ii) Repatriation of individuals whose return is urgent] because of family circumstancesor other reasons in Germany. In each month, a small quota would be allotted tothe British Zone for distribution to German local authorities who could ask forthe return of individual prisoners in genuine compassionate cases ; this would begranted provided the prisoners were &quot; whites &quot; or &quot; greys &quot;.(iii) For the remainder of the &quot; whites &quot; or &quot; greys &quot;, an &quot; age and length of imprison-ment &quot; scheme should be worked out modified to allow for a high priority to begiven to the very young (say those under 20) whose education was interrupted by the war and whom we particularly wish to influence in a democratic direction.This group would include those &quot;whites&quot; and &quot;greys&quot; resident in the british zone but not already repatriated under 3 (i) and (ii), and the bulk of the prisonersresident in other Zones. The rate of return to the other Zones will have to fit in with the numbers which can be accepted in them.4. The &quot;blacks,&quot; or prisoners with nazi or militarist convictions, are excluded from theabove suggestions. Their return will have to be arranged in relation to the measures nowunder examination for the treatment of nazis in Germany. An overriding considerationmust be that they should not be released in Germany until the &quot; whites &quot; and &quot; greys &quot; are all back.5. I propose that the above suggestions should form the basis of a repatriation schemewhich should, when adopted, be publicly announced and adhered to.(B46/13)   no   8/46   W.O.P.   26362
