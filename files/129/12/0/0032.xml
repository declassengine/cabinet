CP (46)5gg. CABINET2nd September, 1946.REPATRIATION Ol&apos; GERMAN PRISONERS OP WAR FROM THE UNITEDKINGDOMMemorandum &quot;by the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to theMinistry of Agriculture and ffisheries.1. Nearly half of the prisoner working force on 3lst July was engaged in agriculture;    the number of these prisoners was equivalentto about 25;&apos;b of the regular farm workers and 20% of regular andcasual workers together.    Any decisions taken on the future of theGerman prisoners in this country have, therefore, a profound effecton the food production programme.    I share the view of theparliamentary Under-Secretary of State,  the  Oar Office,  that a programme of repatriation should be announced as soon as possible,but I am anxious that the agricultural implications of repatriationshould be fully appreciated.2. As regards 1947,  the critical food situation has called forplans which entail the maintenance,  and even the expansion, of our existing crop areas, which still stand at war-time levels.    Acreagesrequired for 1947 are being obtained by compulsory order.    Farmershave already arranged their cropping programmes in consultation with&quot;Jar Agricultural Executive Committees, and sowings will begin thismonth.3. I am in entire accord with the conclusion of the parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Labour and National Service that it isessential that no risk of failure can be run in harvesting the 1947crops because of labour shortage,  and that we should accordingly retainas a minimum the numbers required to ensure this.    His proposal that(assuming the availability of a number of poles for agriculture in1947) a minimum of 215,000 prisoners should be available for the harvest(and for Ministry of Pood requirements)  should, In my view, meet thesituation,    I may, however, point out that the agricultural workers&apos;unions are offering strong opposition to the employment of Poles inagriculture,  and no agreement with them has yet been rerached.    I shouldalso make it clear that apart from the -main harvest period (August -October),  it will be necessary to see that sufficient prisoners areavailable for spring plantings and for the  summer cultivations.4. So far as 1948 is concerned, it is not yet possible to forman/ precise estimate  of what the production programme will be, and hence of the requirements for labour;    the position will be clearer ina few months time.    It is, however,  only reasonable to assume that itwill be necessary in 1948 to aim at a tillage area not far short of1 the 1947 level.    Even on the assumption that it may be possible to relax somewhat our cequirements for bread and potatoes, an increase 1production of fodder crops, which are no less expensive in labour,will be wanted,  since it v/ill not be possible to rely upon imports to provide more than part of our increased requirements for feeding-stuffs needed to restore and expand our livestock production.^HIS DOCUMENT IS LIE ^OPSRTY Og HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYlS QOVSMMMTSECRET COPY WO
5. In the interests of agricultural production,  therefor:., anyrepatriation scheme for German   ,r is oners should be so devised as to&apos;leave &quot;a considerable number available up to the end of the 1948harvest.    It would not be reasonable in the- circumstances or,-evenprudent in the&quot; interests of agriculture  itself on the assumption that )no prisoners will be available  in 1949,  to suggest that numbers shouldbe retained at  the 1947 levelj    for this transitional year something like 100,000 should be retained as compared with the figure of215,000 suggested in paragraph 3 above for 1947.6. It is clear that,  even if a prisoner labour force of this order is retained for 1948, there is still, likely to be a serious shortage of labour.      Source of labour to replace German prisoners arenot in sight;    the release of agricultural workers from the forces will have long been completed.      It is hoped to maintain the Women&apos;s land Army through 1948, but. it will hardly be possible to do more thankeep up the present numbers.      School children will presumably nolonger be available for agricultural work.      The only hope of providing a labour force adequate to maintain agricultural production at a levelcommensurate with our needs is by the recruitment of a considerablenumber of new permanent workers into the industry.      All the evidencegoes to show that the greatest obstacle to any substantial recruitmentis the lack of housing.      I wish, therefore,  to take this opportunityof stressing once again the need,  if our agricultural production is notto be allowed to fall off and decay,  of taking the steps as a matter of urgency to expand and accelerate the provision of houses- for agricultural workers,7. Concurrently with&apos;  the examination of a scheme of repatriation,I feel that it is essential to consider the question of the means ofsecuring an adequate output of work from the prisoners.      All theevidence is that their output has declined,  and the incentive measuresrecently introduced cannot be expected to go far towards restoring it.Whilst the announcement of a regular repatriation scheme shouldundoubtedly assist in improving the willingness to work,  in my viewfurther measures designed to improve the material&apos;conditions of the prisoner&apos;s life will be needed.      Various possibilities suggestthemselves, but detailed consideration is not necessary at this stage,. P.H.C.Ministry of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries.2nd September, 1946.
