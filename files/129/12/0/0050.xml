THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 350.20th September, 1946.CABINET.RECIPROCAL ABOLITION OF VISAS.Memorandum by the Secretary oe State for Foreign Affairs.IN my memorandum of the 26th July (CP. (46) 302) I described the UnitedKingdom visa requirement as a vexatious burden on foreigners and the minorreliefs, in the shape of concessions to business people, as being unsatisfactory andas offering no real palliative. I have recently had the opportunity of confirmingthis opinion at first hand and of learning, from my discussions with His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Paris, the reactions of the French travelling public as reflected in the attitude of their Government towards the British visa question.2. It is now my duty to draw the attention of my colleagues to the damagingeffect on relations between this country and France of maintaining this artificialrestriction on intercourse beyond the stage where its continuance is manifestlynecessary in the interests of national security.3. I note that security was one of the considerations that led my colleagues to the conclusion they reached on the 1st August. I would refer to paragraph 7of my memorandum of the 26th July (CP. (46) 302). For the reasons given inthat paragraph and the further reason that the control of the movement ofundesirables can only effectively be instituted through closer co-operation betweenthe police authorities in this country and abroad, I cannot acquiesce in the viewthat security considerations are sufficient to justify the postponement of the initiation of negotiations for the progressive abolition of visas on a reciprocalbasis.4. In his memorandum of the 26th July (CP. (46) 303) the Home Secretaryemphasised the danger of an influx of undesirable aliens seeking to enter theUnited Kingdom for permanent residence under the cloak of temporary visits.This is a risk which we have to face, and for which elaborate provision exists in the shape of controls at the ports of entry, endorsements on passports by the immigration authorities, registration with the police and at hotels, &amp;o, labourpermits, and penalties for evasion. In the conclusions of the Cabinet Meetingheld on the 1st August this risk was mentioned specifically in relation to displaced persons in Europe, against whom in any case the same remedies are, of course,available. But the mention of displaced persons in this connexion is clearly dueto a misapprehension and is not really relevant. Displaced persons, since theylack national passports, would, even if visa abolition agreements were concluded with their countries of origin, nevertheless not be admissible to the UnitedKingdom without visas. I would, moreover, invite the attention of my colleagues to the last sentence of my above-mentioned memorandum of the 26th July.5. At the Cabinet Meeting to which I have referred in the previous paragraph, the Minister of State drew attention, in my absence, to the world conference on passports and frontier formalities which is to be convened in thenear future under the aegis of the Economic and Social Council of the united nations. His Majesty&apos;s Government have since received an invitation to consider in detail the problems to be discussed at the proposed conference and to appoint representatives to attend a preparatory conference of experts to be convened in13562   [32417]
the coming autumn. It will be the task of the United Kingdom representatives to co-operate with their foreign colleagues in drawing up a constructiveprogramme of the progressive restoration of freedom of travel, in which thequestion of the abolition of visa restrictions cannot fail to occupy a prominentposition. It cannot have been the intention of my colleagues that their decisionof the 1st August should render it impossible for the representatives of HisMajesty&apos;s Government at the conference to make an encouraging contribution tothe discussions on the subject of visa abolition. Yet such would appear to bethe consequence of that decision.6. I therefore once again request my colleagues (a) to agree to the irrrme-diate relaxation of the restriction on the admission of foreign tourists to thiscountry, and (b) to authorise me to initiate negotiations for the conclusion of agreements for the reciprocal abolition of visas with alj countries which Britishsubjects in large numbers regularly visit or of which the nationals regularlyvisit the United Kingdom. I should propose to make a start by opening nego-tiations with France. As to (a), even if the relaxation of this restriction is not an indispensable preliminary to the abolition of visas, I remain, nevertheless, ofthe opinion, expressed in paragraph 6 of my memorandum of the 26th July, thatthe restriction should be relaxed, because I do not think that either the food position or the accommodation position should be allowed to interfere any longerwith the flow of visitors to this country. Moreover, it should not be forgotten that the abolition of the visa system would be reciprocal, and that the british public might expect to derive the same advantages from it as foreigners. any relaxation of control on British tourists who now wish to travel overseas wouldhave an undeniably good effect on public morale after seven years of more orless enforced confinement in this country.E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,20th September, 1946.
