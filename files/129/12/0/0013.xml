SECRETCP, (46) 51551 st July. 1946 COPY NO 3&amp;CABINETDESPATCH OF TROOPS TO IRAQMemora^um by the Secretary of State for indian the Cabinet on 15th July (CM. (46) 68th Meeting),it was decided that an Indian Brigade should be moved toBasra - Shaiba forthwith and that, concurrently, the Britishtroops now awaiting repatriation there should be withdrawn.The Cabinet also took note that the Foreign secretary would arrange to inform the Government of Iraq of whatwas proposed, but that there would be no public announce- &apos;merit of the action which was being taken.20    The action which was being taken has now reached thepoint when it is no longer possible to conceal that it isbeing taken and probably before the brigade leaves India,and certainly when it arrives at Basra, it will be quite impossible to avoid disclosing the nature of the actionto which the despatch of it is contemplated to lead up.3o     The Foreign Office are most anxious that as littlepublicity as possible should be given to the true purposeof the establishment of this Force in Southern Iraq,     they therefore intend that, when the news becomes generally known that there have been troop movements in SouthernIraq, the line to be taken should be that the in-corningtroops are merely replacing an equivalent number of troopscoming home, and that the whole operation is simply a normal relief move.4.     The troops to be repatriated consist of 6,000 to 8, XX)miscellaneous personnel, at present accommodated in atransit camp.     The brigade which the Foreign Officesuggest should be represented as their replacement consists of an organised military force comprising some 9,000 men with a divisional staff, and a thousand vehicles, and includes a field artillery regiment.      It is quiteinconceivable that anybody observing the arrival of this force from India will be deceived for a moment byrepresenting it as the replacement of the miscellaneouspersonnel being repatriated to India.5.     Our information is that the brigade is due to startbeing despatched from Indian ports on 2nd August,     Asthe Viceroy observes, the troops involved need to beinformed/(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT)

India Office,31st July,1946,informed, three clays before that, where they are going;and it will at once become common property that a considerablenumber of troops are going to Iraq not.as details but asunits in a military formation.    Whatever the immediate effect of that, there could bo no doubt that the cat willbe out of the bag as soon as the force starts arriving atBasra,      The question, therefore, for decision is whetherit is better, as the Viceroy strongly recommends, to announceforthwith the reasons for tie despatch of this force and itsultimate potential destination, as stated in paragraph 2 ofhis 1569-S, or to adopt the Foreign Office line and put it out that this is merely a routine relief force - a statement which will deceive no one for a moment but will convict us of an attempt to deceive, and, in so far as it is disingen-uous. will only provoke rumours as to a variety of possibledestinationsc     So far as concerns the effect on indian political opinion, it seems probable that the reactionwould be less unfavourable if the full purpose were franklydisclosed, as that is the protection of Indian lives and interests as well as British, than if Indian troops were despatched to Iraq, evidently in transit to a furtherdestination, for an undisclosed purpose about which thewildest speculation might be provoked,P o -L.

CYPHER TELEGRAM (GIT) from Viceroy to Secretary ofstate, dated 29th July, 1946_It MEDIATE1569-SChiefs of Staff have asked India to proceedwith despatch to Shaiba of a brigade group,     Nocover has been approved.     Officers and men must beinformed at least 3 days before they sail where theyare going, and when this Is done, destination will soon be public property.      Commander-in-Chief has considered putting out story that these troops were going to Iraq to relieve other troops to return toIndia.     Though the ships will bring back a largenumber of Indian troops, these are due in any case for repatriation and story of relief would be untrueand would be discovered in due course.2.     Commander-in-Chief considers, and I agree, thatGovernment should announce that troops are being sent from India to Basra at the request of H.M.G.in order that they may be at hand to protect indian and British interests in Persian oil fields shouldcircumstances demand It.     India depends largely on Persian oilfields for her supplies of petrol andwould suffer considerably if supplies were cut off.I hope PLjiLGo will agree to this announcement.
