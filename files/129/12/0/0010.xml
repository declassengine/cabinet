(46) 3105TH AUGUST,  1946CABINETILLEGAL IMMIGRATION INTO PALESTINE(Previous ?.of: C      (46) &quot;76th Conclusions, Hi nut o 5)Memorandum by the. Secretary of State for the Polonies1,      In accordance with, the conclusions of theCabinet on the 1st August, I have written in strongterms to Dr0 Weizmann calling the attention of theJewish Agency to the fact that the continuance ofillegal immigration during the next few weeks couldnot fail to affect adversely the chances that theplan for the immigration of 100,000 Jews to palestine would &quot;be implemented in the near future as part of the whole plan, and asking him and hiscolleagues in the Agency, in the Lest interests ofthe success of the forthcoming conference and thefuture of Palestine, to do everything in their power to prevent the arrival of further groups ofillegal immigrants.2,      At the same meeting,  the Cabinet invited theC.I.G. S.  to ask the C-in-G. Middle East to draw up a plan for sending illegal Immigrants to Cyprus,and invited me to complete the arrangements for the .reception of those immigrants there.3.      Since those conclusions were reached, therehave &quot;been important developments in the situationwhich I feel hound to &quot;bring to the attention of mycolleagues.4*     On the 1st August,  I received a telegram fromthe High Commissioner informing me that he had discussed the proposal to trans-ship and deportillegal immigrants already in Palestine  (includingterritorial waters) at a meeting of the ExecutiveCouncil attended by the G.0.C and Naval Officer-in-Charge,      This proposal introduced a new and dangerous factor into the situation, and any suchmove at the present juncture would unquestionablyproduce an immediate and hysterical Jewish reaction,which would make it quite impossible to look forany hearing at all for II, M, Government&apos; s proposals fosettlement of the Palestine problem.5.      The High Commissioner at the time of sendingthis telegram considered that it would hepracticable to retain for several weeks the most recent arrivals under reasonable conditions on various ships in Haifa harbour to which they had

&quot;been dispersed.      They would accordingly &quot;be soretained, and consideration would be given to thetransfer of an appropriate number ashore when a proportion of those now in Athlit detention campwere released against the monthly quota in themiddle of August.      This,  the High Commissionerconsidered, should minimise Arab reactions, andin any event, he held it preferable to risk thosereactions rather than to prejudice irretrievablywhat prospects there might he of achieving someamelioration of the present situation by negotiation,in the light of the new policy.      Nevertheless,unless a firm stand were taken on illegal immigrationwithout delay, and if the traffic continued, the Arabreaction would be likely to produce the war on twofronts which the Chiefs of Staff feared.      ThePalestine administration was unable to guard anyfurther illegal immigrants, and if more arrived,there would appear to be only the two alternativesof (i) trans-shipping and deporting them, or(2) releasing a proportion, with the consequentialrisk of Arab violence.     All this underlined theneed for a very urgent decision.      An immediately following telegram containing the&apos;information thatyet another illegal immigrant ship might arrive onthe 2nd August, still further emphasised the needfor the earliest possible preventive measures.6.      In the former telegram outlined above, theHigh Commissioner had raised once again the questionof interception and diversion of ships on the high seas.      In my reply, I reiterated the decision basedon the advice of the First Sea Lord that the operation was impracticable, quite apart from the question ofits legality,      I concluded that such action,desirable as it might otherwise be, was out of thequestion,7.      On the subject of trans-shipment and deportatioij,I took note of the High Commissioner^ action in moving some of the immigrants into other ships inHaifa harbour, asked for more details of the arrange-ments for trans-shipment and deportation and themethods proposed, and asked whether, if the situationmade it essential to reduce the number of immigrantsin Palestine, including territorial waters, it wouldbe practicable to send these ships or other ships carrying new arrivals,- to Cyprus,      In a further telegram,  I asked for the High Commissioner^considered advice and recommendation in the lightof the local situation, and after consultationwith the Service authorities.      Meanwhile,instructions had been given to the Governor of cyprus to press forward with the construction ofcamps, on the assumption that at least 6,000 wouldhave to be accommodated.

8.      X ate on the 3rd August,  two communications were received in the Colonial Office,      The first was a telegram(No.  1272 from the High Commissioner for Palestine)  of whicha copy is attached as Annex I informing me that the informa- -tion as regards the retention of immigrants on ships atu. Haifa was too optimistic and that he had been obliged to* land some women and children to relieve congestion.     Aswill be seen from the telegram, the High Commissionerconsiders that the position has now been reached that if more immigrants are allowed to land we shall have trouble with the Arabs.      On the other hand, trans-shipment and deportation would create a critical situation in theJewish community, including widespread disturbances,strikes and hunger strikes, and would,  he feared, be theend of any chance of co-operating with the Jews in Palestineif not at home also.       Nevertheless,  after full considera-tion,  the High Commissioner reached the conclusion thatillegal immigration must be arrested even if it-meantdeportation from Palestine.     He urged that an announcement should be made by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the effectthat they were determined to arrest illegal immigration and had given precise instructions accordingly.     TheService authorities were in agreement with this recommendation.9*     The second document received on the 3rd August was acopy of a minute from the C.I.G.S.  to the Prime Minister,attached to this paper as Annex 11*     The C.I.G.S.,  it willbe seen,  takes the view that the armed forces in theMiddle East, can,  if the Cabinet so decides, stop illegal immigration, by means of trans-shipment and deportationto Cyprus.     He stresses  the urgent need for a quickdecision.10.    On the lith August, I received a further telegram fromthe High Commissioner1,  (No*1273 top secret - copy attached as Annex III)  informing me that he had seen an outline ofthe military plan for trans-shipment involving transfer inHaifa to British ships for conveyance to Cyprus.Accommodation existing in Cyprus was sufficient for 1,200only and expansion to 2,000 would take some little time,although it was anticipated that accommodation would ultimately be made available for 10,000.      It is^thusuncertain, the High Commissioner concludes, whether sufficientaccommodation will be available,  and shipping ready,  to dealwith the substantial influx now believed to be imminent.11.    It will be seen that the alternatives we are now facedwith are these(1)    to release illegal immigrants in Palestine at separately faster than can be permitted in the monthly quota,since existing provision for retention in camp or onboard ship is inadequate.      This course would- almost certainly bring about a clash with the Arabs andwould involve the possibility of that war on twofronts which the military authorities are so anxiousto avoid.     The extent to which the consequences ofalienation of     the Arabs might spread in the arab league and throughout the Middle East need no stressing.The Egyptian negotiations might be seriously affected.

(2)    The second alternative is the plan of trans-shipment and deportation of immigrants to Cyprus.According to the latest information, this might onlybe possible for the present up to the total of 1,200for which accommodation can be made ready immediately in Cyprus.     Further movements would only be possibleas additional accommodation became available.     Thiswould not entirely alleviate the accommodation problem in Palestine, but the t ,200 would clearly help.     Thevery serious possible effects of the adoption of this alternative are described in paragraph k above,  and Iwould again stress the High Commissioners fear thatsuch action would be an end to any chance of co-operation with the Jews in Palestine^ if not at homealso.       Moreover, there is the strong Zionist reaction in the United States and throughout the world to beconsidered.12.    The disadvantages of either course are clearly very great.My own feeling is that the decisive factor should be thatstressed by the Military authorities,  the necessity for avoiding a war on two fronts with Arabs and Jews at thesame time.     If this course is adopted a further pointrequires consideration.      This is the High Commissionersrequest,  endorsed by the C.I.G.S.  that an announcement of future policy in dealing with illegal immigration should bemade by H.M. Government.      I am- strongly of opinion that weshould&apos; accede to this request.      The announcement wouldstress the indefensible character of the illegal immigranttraffic and the necessity of bringing it to an end in viewof the fatal effect its continuance is likely to have on thehopes of any general Palestine settlement&apos;, including the .question of properly organised Jewish immigration.      Itwould go on to make abundantly clear that H.M. Governmentis determined to do everything in its power to stop this traffic.     The announcement would go on to state thatimmigrants on all ships on the high seas at the time wouldbe conveyed to   Cyprus, where all reasonable measures wouldbe taken for their health and well being.      On humanitariangrounds,  they would be informed of H.M. Government&apos;s intentionto hold them there until the question of their admission to palestine could be considered in the light of futureimmigration policy.     It &apos;would be desirable to consult theHigh Commissioner on the terras of any announcement issued.11)..    It is of course necessary to bear in mind, that those responsible for the illegal immigrant traffic might neverthe-less continue to send ships to Palestine notwithstanding theefforts of the Foreign Office to prevent them, and that,since it is impossible to return the immigrants on such ships to the ports from which they started, H.M. Governmentwould be bound to agree to their trans-shipment to Cyprus.15*    I therefore recommend that:(1)    H.M. Government should decide that the HighCommissioner, in consultation with the MilitaryAuthorities,   should be authorised to arrange ashe deems necessary for the trans-shipment and deportation from time to time to Cyprus, fordetention up to the limit of available accommodationthere, of the illegal immigrants now on board ship in Haifa and arriving on further ships now on thehigh seas.

(2)    That the announcement on the lines described in paragraph 13 above be agreed with the HighCommissioner and issued on behalf of H.M.Government,suitable arrangements being made to secure fullpublioity here, in Palestine, and in theUnited States.(Intd.)

ANNEX ICypher (O.T. F. )FROM PALESTINE  (General Sir A.  Cunningham)TO S.   OF S. .  COLONIESD. 3rd August, 1946.R. 3rd   &quot; 1946.    20.00 hrs.MOST  immediate no. 1272 Top Secret and Personal.Your top secret and personal telegram No.   1396.Your paragraph 1.      It has now been found thatthe information given to me regarding the keeping of the immigrants on ships was too optimistic and I have had toland some women and. children in order to relieve congestion.Your paragraphs 3 and 4.      I was informed by0.0.C.  that Commander-in-Chief had been told by Chief of theImperial General Staff that His Majesty&apos;s Government had agreedto trans-shipping and deportation.      I take it from theterms of your telegram that this is not correct arid thatChief of the Imperial General Staff had only been told to prepare a plan.      I am getting details from Commander-in-Chief Middle East re plan and hope to hold a meetingon the subject tomorrow, after which I will send you details.I should, I think, state the dilemma in which we are placedhere in regard to continued illegal immigration.      my proposals have, up to the moment, been confined to thosewhich would leave the door open to settlement by negotiation.We have now reached the position that if we allow any more toland we will almost certainljr have trouble with the Arabs.Moreover, admission if illegal immigrants at this timedoes not sensibly reduce Jewish tension.      On the other hand,to trans-ship and deport them will create a critical situationin Yishuv, including widespread disturbances, strikes, hungerstrikes, and will, I am afraid, put an end to any chance ofco-operating with them out here if not at home also.Nevertheless after full consideration, I have come&quot;to theconclusion that illegal immigration must be arrested evenif it means deportation from here.      This is in accordancewith my previously expressed opinion that,, if we have to makea choice,  it is better to deal first with the Jews rather thanthe Arabs, or Arabs and Jews together.      I would urge that,at appropriate time,  an    announcement should be made byHis Majesty&apos;s Government to the effect that they were determined to arrest illegal immigration and have given precise instructionsaccordingly.      I feel that to make the announcement at homewould make it clear that the burden does not solely lie on thePalestine administration, which is a mistake which is often madein the world at large.      The announcement might also include the final sentence of paragraph 3 of my telegram No.1255.

Your telegram No. lkOl arrived after I had sent the above for enciphering.      Service authorities arc inagreement though I have not yet hoard their plans fortrans-shipment.      I believe that they think it possible.Prom information available, it would appear that the numberof immigrants on scas will almost certainly force the taking of decision upon us and that very early.(Corrections received Uth August, 19u7)ANNEX IIPRIME MINISTERILLEGAL IMMIGRATION INTO PALESTINE1.      I have scon Telegram No. 1255 of 1st Augustfrom the High Commissioner, which in my view offersno solution at all to the problem of stopping illegal immigration into Palestine.2,      I have consulted the Commander-in-chief, middle east Land Forces.      If the&apos;Cabinet so decides,  the armed Forces in the Middle East can and will stop illegal immigration.i3.      There arc the following factors to be taken intoconsideration in making the plan:-(a) The capacity of. Cyprus.(b) The provision of British ships.(c) The actual problem of trans-shipment.(d) The- Jewish reaction probable In Palestine.k*      Capacity of C;yprusiThe Army can provide immediately Camps which willhold 2,000.      This figure can bo increased later, butin the meantime it will be necessary for the civil authorities to provide accommodation for any numberabove 2,000.      I note that at the Cabinet Meeting on1st August the Colonial Secretary said that Cyprus would,be able to accommodate up to 8,000 or 9,000&apos; Jews but possiblythis Is optimistic.      In any case, if eventually Cyprusbecomes filled, then other places must be found to whichillegal immigrants can be. sent.The troops required for guard purposes in Cyprus areavailable. -      :5.   - Proyis ion., of British shipsConditions- on the isnmigration ships when they arriveare very- bad and the, illegal immigrants cannot be kepton. them for long.  . .&apos;.I.t- is necessary for&apos;the Ministry ofWar Transport to make the:.requisite . ships immediately available, and to allocate them definitely for this taskon a long&apos; term basis. - .. *-7-    -

6.    . T r ans-s hipment &apos; &apos;There may be passive resistance and hunger strikeswhich will produce unpleasant scenes and. possibly minorinjuries, but I consider that the plan can be put intoeffect without causing fatal casualties.      Trans-shipmentwill, take place in Haifa Bay or Harbour.   The whole matter will be handled by the Armed Forces assisted bythe Police,, in the most humane manner possible;    adequatemedical arrangements will be made by the Military medicalauthorities,  and Doctors, Nurses and ambulances provided.Pregnant women and women with young children will be landed in Palestine and kept in Athlit Camp, unless they wish to accompany their husbands to Cyprus.7*      Jewish ReactionThere will undoubtedly be strong Jewish reaction.This can and will be dealt with;    the necessary forces are available and&quot; l&quot; will ensure that at all times wekeep one step ahead of the Haganah and other Jewishillegal armed forces.8,      Other pointsThe need for a decision is urgent.      3,000 illegal immigrants arrived on 30 and 31 July and more are expected.I am prieparoo. to put this plan into operation as soon asHis Majesty&apos;s Government give me the order.      In viewof the urgency of the matter, you may not wish to wait -until next Wednesday&apos;s Cabinet Meeting.9,      I hope very much that His Majesty&apos;s Government, whenthey have made their decision, will make a public statement of the policy that is to be adopted.      This willbe of groat assistance to the Commanders who will have,to carry out the plan,10, .   I have sent a copy of this minute to the Secretaryof State for the Colonies,,(Signed)MONTGOMERY OP ALAMSING. I. G. S.3rd. August, 1946

S.  in which he outlines his plan for trans-shipment.      It entails transfer in Haifa Bayor harbour of illegal immigrants from the ships on whichthey have arrived and whose condition may be assumed to be such that they could not be used as transport, to british ships for conveyance to, and accommodation in, Cyprus.C-in-C.  states that existing camp accommodation in Cyprus would suffice for 1,200 only and that expansion of above accommoda-tion for 2,000 will take some little time but I understandho anticipates that accommodation will be made availablefor 10,000.      It is accordingly uncertain whether sufficientaccommodation will be available and shipping will be readyto deal with imminent influx, which is reported to be substantial.
