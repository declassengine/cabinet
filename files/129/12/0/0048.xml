Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 348.18^ September, 1946.CABINET.CLOTHING AND TEXTILES FOR THE / SERVICES.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.IN order to stimulate recruitment the &quot;Service Departments have recentlysought Board of Trade agreement to the provision of additional textile and clothing supplies to the Services.(i) Cotipons for civilian clothing. I announced on the 29th July that other ranks in the Forces would shortly be given 21 coupons per year for thepurchase of civilian clothing. This would at once provide sportsj acket and flannel trousers for each man.(ii) Pyjamas and handkerchiefs. The War Office, supported by the other services, have proposed to make pyjamas and handkerchiefs a-Serviceissue to all other ranks, but the quantities of cloth required are so great in relation to civilian supplies that they have agreed not to pursue this, provided I will increase the issue of clothing couponsfrom 21 to 30 per year.(iii) Walking-out dress for the Army. -The War Office wish to give other ranks a uniform walking-out dress, additional to normal Serviceclothing, made from a good quality worsted cloth. They think thatsthe Admiralty and Air Ministry will not ask for a similar outfit forsailors and airmen, since their normal service uniform is not so drab;but !I am not sure ^whether the other Services definitely agree,(i-v) ^Sheets.--Al\ three Services want to provide sheets for other ranks, andthe quantities estimated to be required in the first year are 1:200,000for the War Office, 6/700,000 for the Admiralty and 250,000 forthe Air Ministry (flying crews in the R.A.F. already have sheets).Thereafter the quantities required would be somewhat less.2. I am anxious that the Services should be as well equipped as possible with civilian clothing, having regard to their Service issues and current civilianstandards. I can accept the proposal at (ii) above to raise the issue of civiliancoupons to 30 per year for men (at the same time withdrawing the existing chitsystem for handkerchiefs). This is a substantial concession bearing in mind thatthe present civilian ration is only 60.3. The proposals at (iii) and (iv), however, are, for the reasons given below,in a different category.Effect of walking-out dress proposal on export trade and civilian supplies.4. The output of the wool industry, owing to shortage of labour, is still only some 75 per cent, of pre-war, and for several months there has been no net increasein the labour force. We can have no certainty or even confidence whether or whensupplies, including such small imports as may be possible, will return to pre-war.In these circumstances export or home trade must in any case suffer, all the moresince the Service requirement in a normal post-war year is likely to be two or[32406]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
three times pre-war. This can be seen from the following table., showing the roughdistribution of wool cloth output in million linear yards : 1946 19481935.5 (about)(estimated),   (estimated).Government25* 13 (exa13 (excluding the walkingout dress).Export      .........     80Home Civilian Apparel ...   205285601451 205    j257Total290230270* Including demobilisation.   The rate at the end of the year will be much lower.The proposed walking-out dress would require some 1\ million yards of clothper year for the first two years, and thereafter some 1 million yards per year;the cloth would be of a type costing 12s. 6d. a yard and equivalent to the verybest, and better than the majority, of utility suitings. If the other services had similar uniforms the requirement would presumably be increased to some-J million yards for the first year. In terms of export even the 1^ million yardswould be worth over  1,000,000, and good quality worsteds are particularlysuitable for export to North and South America, provided we can make a reasonably good show in these markets without delay. I suggest that serious consideration should be given to the question whether the effect of this uniformon recruitment (bearing in mind that the Services will already have coupons to buy flannel trousers and jacket and also have their pre-enlistment civilianclothing) is sufficient to justify losing every year  1,000,000 of exports to Americaor further reducing civilian supplies of this type of cloth.Effect of sheets proposal on civilian standards.5. The provision of sheets for the Services would seriously delay the restora-tion of minimum civilian standards. During the war the production of sheetsfor the home market was almost eliminated, and the shortage of the past six years has created an enormous replacement need. Civilian production has beenexpanded as rapidly as possible since the war ended, but it is only now reaching13-5 million sheets and cotton blankets per year, or 55 per cent, of pre-war. Inorder to ensure supplies to those who need them most, e.g., those setting up house on marriage or those with growing children, dockets are issued to these priorityclasses, which even now will take half the total supply. This leaves for thegeneral public, to meet all the normal and abnormal replacement demand, and taking account of any Government surpluses or any small imports that are likelyto be available, only some 6/7,000,000 per year or 25 to 30 per cent, of pre-war :bitherto the public have had practically none. Production is still rising, but bynext spring non-priority supplies will still not be more than 50 per cent, of pre-war. Sheets rank high in the public&apos;s schedule of needs, and it is in my view very doubtful whether we can afford to provide them for the Services, beyondthe existing limited provision, until civilian supplies have risen very much nearer to demand than at present.6. Unless, therefore, the Government regard these particular amenitiesas of paramount importance to recruiting, I do not think we can provide them,but in the case of sheets I would be prepared to look at this matter again ina year&apos;s time.R.
