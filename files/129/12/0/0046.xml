(THIS DOGDMSNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SG RET C.P. (h6) 3jj613TH SEPTEMBER,  19h6COPY NO.    6-*CABINETSQUATTERSNote by the secretary by direction of the Prime Minister I circulate a minute by tho Attorney-General,  dated 10th September.THE PRIME MISTERI consulted this morning with tho Director of public prosecutions j, Sir Prank New scan of the Home Office, and representatives from the Treasury Solicitor&apos;s Office andthe Ministry of Works about the position in regard to theso  called squatters.I. As I Indicated in&apos;the view I tentatively expressed,yesterday, it does not seem practicable to expel thesquatters -  by force and without first taking legal proceedings.      The ancient statutes against forcibleentry appear to apply even to an owner seeking to recoverpromises from a trespoasser,   and whilst it may well be thatthe Crown is not technically bound by these statutes itsconce    undesirable in the circumstances to have to rely onthis possible exemption.      In tiny event I apprehend thatthere are weighty political and practical objectionsagainst attempting to recover possession by extra-judicialforce.II. This being so,  civil proceedings will have to be takenin Court, and those are to be commenced tomorrow by theissue of Writs claiming damages for trespass against six of the present squatters in the building held underrequisition by the Ministry of Works,  being those whoseem to have taken a goading part as members of thecommittees which the squatters have established.Unfortunately there is some legal doubt whether theMinister of Works is entitled to sue by way of theordinary procedure,   s.ino.o the relevant statute docs not expressly so empower him.   -  Such authority as there is,and I should not expect it to be reversed unless thematter goes to the House of Lords,  is in favour of his(Signed) NORMAN brook cabinet Office, S.W.I.lgTH SEPTEMBER,  1946.COPY

right to sue, and as the alternative procedure is slowand cumbersome and docs not admit of any expedition, Ihave considered  it better to take such risks as arcinvolved in the ordinary procedure by Writ and to advise that application should be made to the Court on the 18th(the earliest available date) for interlocutory injunctions.I think that such injunctions ought to be   granted, but thematter is entirely one for the discretion of the Judgeconcerned,      If the Judge refuses injunctions on the groundthat the Minister has no novas? to sue we shall have to revert to the special procedure and shall only have lost aweek in a process which, on that view, may take many months.Fortunately the difficulty in regard to the right to sue doesnot arise in the case of the Minister of Health.      It isthought that Fountain Court, which wes taken overduring the night, is under requisition by that Minister,and if this turns  out to be the fact actions by Writ willalso be started! at once against a number of squatters inhis name, since such actions will not be liable to be defeated on similar grounds.      At the same time informalapproaches will be made to the owners of the non-roqusitionod premises involved with.a view to theircommencing proceedings in the same way, since they willnot have to face the various technical obstacles which,owing to the great inconvenience of the present law as to crown proceedings, stand in the way of the Crown.III. If interlocutory Injunctions aro granted anddisobeyed It should not be difficult to apprehend the defendants concerned for contempt of Court.IV. Proceedings against the six named Defendants will not,of course, bind the other squatters, who, even if theCrown succeeds, may decide to stay on.      It is to be hopedthat successful proceedings &quot;will discourage them from so doing, but if need be further civil proceedings will haveto be taken against all those who continue their tresspassesIt may be that at that stage some facilities in the way oftransport etc,, might encourage the rest of the squattersto leave,V. It seems clear that if squatters attempt to takepossession of buildings by force,  as by br aking open doors,overcoming the caret nicer:&apos;-by a show of sir ngth or otherwise,they commit an indictable offence under the statutes Inrelation to forcible entry.      They may also constitute anunlawful assembly or otherwise commit a breach of the Peace.It is the duty of the Police to prevent any such offencesif they can and to apprehend offenders.      The Police fgidM.Ir5 had no advance information about the action taken sofar but they will be very much on the qui vive in future and they will do what they can to prevent further forcibleentries.      It is suggested that the Departments concernedwarn all caretakers to keep all doors etc., locked, on no account or pretext to admit unauthorised persons, and todial 999 and call for Police assistance if any suspicion of trouble arises.      The Police will be ready to respond to such calls.

VI. What has boon done has clearly bean the subject of careful end deliberate planning and seems to me to amount toa common law conspiracy - both to commit trespasses and toobtain possession of premises by unlawful and forciblemeans.      The Director will consider in the ordinary coursewhether there is evidence which would justify theinstitution of criminal proceedings a;;oinst particularindividuals, o.s.  leaders of the Communist Party, whohave taken a prominent part in organising what has beendone.VII. It would probably bo desirable that an official statement should be issued statin.a;, in-.,or alia (a) thatthe Government is advised that what has been doneconstitutes a violation both of the civil and of the criminal law;    (b) that Writs are being is ued claimingdamages and an injunction, and that action will be taken against all those who persist in their illegal course;and (c)  that the Director of Public Prosecutions is considering in the ordinary course the institution of criminal proceedings against persons who have taken partin organising, or who have actually participated in, whatwas done.(Intld.)
