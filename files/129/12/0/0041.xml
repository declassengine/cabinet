THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1946.SECRET.Copy No.  tS 3CP. (46) 341.10th September, 1946.CABINET.THE UNITED NATIONS AND NON-MILITARY ENFORCEMENTACTION.ITEM No. 17 of the agenda of the Economic and Social Council at its thirdsession (New York, the 11th September) reads in part as follows : &quot; Consideration of arrangements for conferring .... with representa-tives of the Security Council .... concerning the methods co-operationwith (this body) in dealing with matters of common concern.&quot;2. The outstandingly important question of common concern to the twoCouncils is economic enforcement action or &quot; economic sanctions.&quot; We need todecide-(a) whether any preliminary discussion of this subject should be undertaken by the United Nations at this stage;(b) if so, what our views are about the nature and scope of such discussion.3. We also need to consider in a preliminary way (c) the general natureof the line which we think our representative at the Economic and Social council should take in regard to the direction of the discussion; in particular should we take the line that we recommend the study of possible United Nations machineryfor the collection of economic information and the execution of economicenforcement action?4. At the second session of the Economic and Social Council (New York,.May-June, 1946), several delegates, notably those of the United Kingdom andBelgium, drew attention to the importance of this subject. I myself mentioned the importance of transport and communications matters in connection witheconomic enforcement action and suggested that I would develop the idea furtherwhen the Council came to discuss its relations with the Security Council. I donot think it is possible, therefore, to avoid the further development of this subject at the next Council meeting, particularly as economic enforcement action isforeseen in the Charter itself (Article 41 (])). I accordingly invite my colleagues to agree to the following action : (a) At the Economic and Social Council meeting we should take the line thatthe Economic and Social Council and the Security Council shouldstudy their mutual relationship and questions arising therefrom, andthat a small ad hoc committee of members of the two Councils shouldbe set up for this purpose.(b) This Committee should devote particular attention to the terms ofArticle 41 of the Charter regarding non-military enforcementmeasures (text in footnote) and discuss what steps, if any, need to be. taken to ensure the smooth working of that Article. It should alsostudy the continuation or imposition of such measures simultaneously with the imposition of military sanctions contemplated in Article 42.(&apos;) Article 41. &quot; The Security Council may decide what measures not involving the use ofwined force are to be employed to give effect to its decisions, and it may call upon the Membersof the United Nations to apply such measures. These may include complete or partial interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea, air, postal, telegraphic, radio, and other means ofcommunication, and the severance of diplomatic relations.&quot;(A) Memorandum by the Minister of State.(B) Recommendations.13549   [323741
(c) The United Kingdom representative on the Economic and Social council should be authorised to suggest that the Committee study among other things(i) any extensions of the existing United Nations machinery whichmay be necessary to ensure the advance planning and the effective implementation of economic enforcement measures,and(ii) any steps which may be necessary to amend international con-ventions in the economic and social field or to include provisions in new conventions or in agreements between the united nations and specialised agencies in order to facilitate the workof any non-military enforcement measures the United Nationsmay feel called upon to take.(C) Detailed Considerations.5. Article 41 of the Charter provides for the imposition of non-militarysanctions, but sets up no machinery to plan or impose them.6. In the actual application of enforcement measures, including economic sanctions, the initiative will necessarily be with the Security Council. TheEconomic and Social Council is, however, also concerned in that it may be calledupon to provide assistance to the Security Council, and in that it is responsiblefor negotiating agreements with specialised agencies, some of which may becalled upon to assist the Security Council in connection with the application of sanctions.7. It may be well, at this point, to indicate what we mean by economicenforcement measures. The precise form which these measures would takeis, of course, a matter which could only be worked out by the appropriate united nations machinery. The sort of measures we have in mind, however, include those set forth in the Annex. Those listed under Heading 1 of the Annex,together with the addition of the &quot; diplomatic sanction &quot;-the severance of diplo-matic relations which is somewhat apart from the others, and which is not considered in this Note, constitute the non-military enforcement measures which fall within the ambit of Article 41.8 We are committed by Article 41 of the Charter to give at least con-sideration to the application of such measures, and it should be our concern toensure that, if applied, they do not fail by reason of any inadequacy in theUnited Nations machinery.Preparatory Action.9. If the Security Council is to be in a position to apply economic sanctionswith the greatest effect, it must be provided in advance with machinery whichwill (a) Accumulate economic intelligence.(6) Study legal questions arising in connection with the application ofeconomic sanctions (neutral rights, &amp;c).(c) Advise the appropriate organs of the United Nations regarding any provisions which should be inserted in new or revised international conventions or agreements, including relationship agreements withspecialised agencies to facilitate the effective application of economic sanctions.(d) Advise the Security Council, on its request, regarding the methods of pressure which might be feasible in particular cases.(e) Provide any assistance required in the actual administration of enforce-ment measures.10. The bulk of executive action would no doubt be taken by Governments.The Security Council should, however, be able, if it has adequate machinery, toassist Governments, e.g., by acting as a clearing centre for information regarding&apos;the economy of the offending State and its current trade, or by measures suchas rationing&quot; of particular commodities to the offending State or to&quot; adjacent neutrals.&quot;11. Further, the accumulation of economic warfare intelligence will be useful to the Security Council and Military Staff Committee for strategic andmilitary purposes, e.g., in the choice of targets for air attack.   It is not, of
course, contemplated that Governments would confide to the United Nationstheir own secret economic information regarding the war potential of particular countries. However, at times when sanctions are actually being applied, theymight possibly make recommendations based on secret economic information withoutdisclosing its source. Nevertheless, a great deal of appropriate information canbe derived from material available imblicly, and this could be quietly brought together and arranged in an appropriate form.12. To perform these functions, I suggest that the United Nations oughtto have an Economic Staff Committee whose role in respect of economic enforce-ment measures generally would correspond to the role of the Military staff committee in respect of military enforcement measures. Such an EconomicStaff Committee should clearly not be attached exclusively to the Economic and social Council since the terms of the latter are, broadly speaking, directed tothe promotion of economic and social welfare. The Security Council will havethe principal role to play since it is primarily responsible for the maintenanceof international peace and security (Charter, Article 24 (1)); but it may be feltundesirable to attach the Economic Staff Committee exclusively to the security council and a system of appointment by and responsibility to both Councilsmight be worked out.Steps to be taken at the forthcoming meeting of the Economic and Social Council.13. If the establishment of an Economic Staff Committee, sooner or later,is regarded as a desirable objective, it is for consideration how far our repre-sentatives should go in promoting this at the forthcoming meeting of the Economicand Social Council, or what other immediate steps it might be expedient to take to promote the efficacy of economic enforcement measures.14. I do not suggest that the establishment of such a Committee as has been described can be regarded as an urgent necessity. On the other hand, unless some-thing is definitely to be gained by delay I think that there are advantages in getting started on this matter. So that both the U.N.O. Secretariat and the specialised agencies may know, while they are still in a formative stage, whatrole they are expected to play in the organisation of economic sanctions andwould enable a start to be made in the accumulation of intelligence, in the amending of conventions and in the solution of a number of difficult legalproblems. There is also the danger that, if we do not put forward our own views,the matter may be raised by other countries and solutions advanced which are less agreeable to us. In particular, in view of the preoccupation of the security council with other matters it is possible that the Economic and Social council may assume a larger degree of responsibility for the organisation of economic sanctions than we would like.15. It may be argued that it is inexpedient for the United Nations to tackle these problems now on the ground that a discussion of economic enforce-ment measures may undermine confidence and may thus have adverse effects onthe revival of world trade.16. It should be possible for the United Nations to make it clear to theworld that what is under discussion is not economic sanctions themselves, but themethod by which they should be prepared if they should ever be needed. I am confident that any serious proposal to prepare the United Nations as an instru-ment for the restraint of aggressive war will create general confidence and notundermine it. In any case the action proposed is simply the filling of a gap in theUnited Nations machinery which.was not filled by the Charter; the Charter set upmachinery for the study of military sanctions (i.e., the Military Staff Committee)but although it laid down that non-military sanctions should be applied firstit provided no machinery for studying their preparation. It is quite illogicalto object to such study being undertaken when the study of military sanctionshas been going on for the last nine months.17. The main objection may be that the study of non-military enforcementmeasures may run into the same impasse that other United Nations discussions have reached owing to obstruction by the Soviet Delegation. But it is not certainthat the Soviet will obstruct this proposition, and in any case that this is noreason for making no effort at all.18. I therefore arrive at the recommendations set out in Section B abovefind hope that my colleagues will authorise me to proceed as suggested there. Inthe meantime I hope that the Departments concerned will be authorised to study
the matter in further detail. I am certain that this is desirable, since the examination which the Foreign Office have made of the machinery for enforcingsanctions against Italy in 1935 shows that the League of Nations was badlyequipped in the absence of proper machinery, both because the legislative positionin the various member countries had not been studied in advance and because ofthe absence of proper information regarding the measures which would be mostspeedily effective.P. J. N.-B.10th September, 1946.ANNEX.Examples of Possible Economic Enforcement Measures.1. Economic Enforcement Measures unaccompanied by Military Measures.(a) Restriction or prohibition, by each co-operating country, of some or alhcategories of exports to the offending country.(b) Restriction or prohibition of some or all categories of imports from theoffending country.(c) Partial or complete with-holding of transport facilities by land, sea or air, from the carriage of goods or passengers to or from the offendingcountry.(d) Partial or complete cutting off of postal or tele-communications withthe offending country.(e) Partial or complete with-holding of port and refuelling facilities fromthe shipping of the offending country.(/) Partial or complete with-holding of payments to the offending country,and blocking of its assets.(g) Measures analogous to (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (/) above but applied not against the offending country but against &quot;adjacent neutrals,&quot; i.e.,countries failing to co-operate in the application of economic sanctions and acting as a channel through which the offending country can obtain supplies and market its exports, thus evading the restric-tions or prohibitions applied by the&apos; co-operating countries. such measures would not take the form of wholesale prohibitions orembargoes. Co-operating countries might prohibit their nationalsfrom having dealings with firms suspected of acting as intermediariesand might exercise a quantitative restriction on their trade withadjacent neutrals. Entrepot trade might also be controlled with these objects in view.2. Economic Enforcement Measures in Conjunction tvith Military Measures.Measures analogous to 1 (a) to (g) above but applied, not by each co-operatingcountry in its own trade with the offending country or with &quot; adjacent neutrals,&quot;but through direct interception, by naval blockade or otherwise, of the trade of&quot; adjacent neutrals &quot; between themselves or with the offending country. This isthe sort of thing with which we were familiar during the war under &quot;the names of contraband control, enemy export control, &amp;e, and might, if it were to lastlong enough, involve the issuing of navicerts, ship warrants, &amp;c, i.e., certificates;guaranteeing the purity of neutral cargoes or ships.
