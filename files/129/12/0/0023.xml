The food situation in India is again causing us veryserious anxiety.     Government held stocks in India havebeen gradually running down since the beginning of theyear and at many times it seemed doubtful whetherdistribution could be maintained until improved internalprocurement comes to the rescue in November and December.The Government of India have indeed perhaps been lucky tohave got through so far.   In my memorandum No. W.F.S.. (46).125 of 9th July I said that it then looked as if theGovernment of India would be able to prevent a breakdown of rationing at least up to August.     Latest reportshowever from the Government of India indicate., that onthe basis of supplies so far in sight they are bound tohave a breakdown of rationing in India at any time fromthe middle of September onwards and that by 1st Octobertheir overall stocks of cereals will amount only toabout 3 weeks&apos; supply with only a week&apos;s supply on 1stNovember.     The Government of India calculate theminimum safety level of the stocks required to maintainrationing in India at 6 weeks5 supply.      The situationdescribed above is therefore very serious and must inevitably lead, unless measures can be taken to counterit, not merely to local breakdowns but to widespreaddisaster and large scale famine.      The effect of thison the political situation can be imagined without difficulty.     The position is explained in more detail in the note which I enclose herewith.The Government of India, feel that their main hopeof tiding over disaster lies in augmenting shipments toIndia from the U.S.A, and they have suggested that this might be achieved, by an all round cut of 15 per cent inthe programme of other claimants on United States supplies during August, the United Kingdom giving a lead to therest by offering to reduce their own programme by this amount for diversion to India.      I realise, however,that it is impracticable in present circumstances forthis country to accept  . further sacrifices,    But i suggest that the British Food Mission at washington should be informed at once of the salient points in theIndian food situation as described in the enclosed noteand asked to consult urgently with the United StatesGovernment with a view to finding some means, inconsultation with the latter, of tiding over the acutecrisis with which the Government of India are bound to be faced during the next few weeks.      In view of the time which must elapse before any additional supplies shippedto India can arrive in that country&apos; - about 6 weeks in thecase of shipments from America - any measures that canbe taken must be taken without delay if they are to be effective.     If, however, the situation in India can beheld until the middle of November .there is a reasonablehope that with the improvement in internal procurementwhich the Government, of India hope for from Novemberonwards/Copy of letter dated 8th.

Note on the food situation in India during the__period August to October., 1946_According to the latest figures provided by theGovernment of India the total stocks available in india on the 1st August for maintaining the rationing systemsfor food grains in the deficit Provinces and States were estimated at 1,190,000 tons.      An appendix is attached tothis note giving the best estimate which can be made atpresent of imports into India from abroad up to the endof October next.      On the basis of these figures andafter allowing for internal supplies (both those to beprocured locally in deficit Provinces and States andthose to be provided by the surplus administrations inIndia) as calculated by the Government of India, theestimated stock position in India in respect of the deficit areas mentioned above, the Defence Services,etc. is as follows (figures in thousands of tons):-Stocks on 1st August 1,1.90Internal supplies during august 137Imports during August 261Total supplies in August 1,588Offtake in August 720Stocks on 1st September 868Internal supplies during september 111Imports during September ggTotal supplies in September 1,2-67Offtake in September 717Stocks on 1st October 550Internal supplies during october 110Imports during October 251Total supplies in&apos;October 911Offtake in October 717Stocks on 1st November 1942.     The Government of India calculate the minimum stocks which they require in order to prevent a breakdown,intheir rationing systems at six weeks supply, which is equivalent to about one million tons.     In view oi thevast territories for which they are responsible, whichare Comparable with the whole European continent ratnerthan with any individual European country, and bearing that mind difficulties of communication in India especiallyduring the monsoon, an average level for stocks of six   ,weeks supply   which naturally involves a much lower marginin many areas, is not at all an unreasonable requirement.It/

It will bo seen, however, that the overage stock,position on 1st September will fall below the minimumsafety level of six weeks supply;   that on 1st Octoberaverage stocks will bo sufficient for about three weeks&apos;consumption and that by 1st November they will have been so seriously reduced that only about one week&apos;s supplies will be available.      Moreover, it should be borne inmind that the above calculations assume that supplies from abroad will arrive according to schedule, whereaspast experience has shown that for one reason or another,the fulfilment of shipping programmes is invariablysubject to considerable delay. &apos;     It is obvious that theGovernment of India will inevitably be faced with a veryserious situation from the middle of September onwards.3.     The figures show that in order to maintain theGovernment of India&apos;s stocks at tho level of six weeks.!&apos;supply, it would be necessary to ship, so as to arrivebefore the end of September, over and above supplies nowin sight, an additional 500,000 tons of cereals fromabroad, and a further 350,000 tons for arrival before theend of October.     This is clearly impracticable, and wemust face the fact that, whatever measures are taken, itwill probably be impossible to a,void at cany rate locibreakdowns of rationing in India from about the middle ofSeptember onwards.      It is suggested, however, that weshould at any rate aim at maintaining stocks in India ata level - say of one month&apos;s consumption (about 717,000tons) - which should enable the Government of India atleast to keep the food situation generally under controland to avert a widespread calamity of the dimensionswhich seem inevitable on the basis of the imports fromabroad at present in sight,4.     It will be seen from the figures given in paragraph1 above that, in order to provide the Government of india with one month&apos;s stock on 1st October, it would benecessary to ship in addition to present programmes afurther 1B7,000 tons of cereals for arrival in India beforethe end of September and yet another 356,000 tons beforethe end of October, or a total of 523,000 tons over thotwo months.5.    What measures are open to us to secure the arrival of the additional imports of 167,000 tons in September,and of ,theJTurfc-her 356,000 tons in October mentionedabove?     It is clear in tho first place that at any rateevery possible effort should bo made to maximise shipments to India during tho next few weeks under the programmesalready arranged as shown in the appendix to this noteand to eliminate shipping delays.     Further possiblesources of increased supplies are as follows:-(a) India has purchased in tho Argentine 238,000 tonsof maize, for which it has not yet been possible tosecure export permits from the Argentine Government,in addition to tho 66,000 tons mentioned in theappendix to this note which are already covered byexport/

r7-d-export licences, and ships to lift about 108,000 tonsof it arc immediately available.     Further effortsmust be made to persuade the Argentine Governmonttorelease further quantities for export and with thisobject a special Indian Food Mission (which is now onthe point of departure by air from London) is being sent to Buenos Aires.      But since the voyage fromthe Argentine to India takes about six weeks, any additional supplies from this source would have to be shipped by early September if they are to arrive inIndia before the end of October,,(b) The Ministry of Food are in negotiation on behalf ofthe Government of India for about 60,000 tons of TurkisJabarley and 70,000 tons of Turkish wheat.     efforts should be made to complete these transactions as quickly as possible and to lay on shipping so as toensure that some at least of those quantities arrive inIndia in Soptcaber and October.(c) Ho Mo Go are on the point of concluding can agreement withthe Iraqi Government for the purchase of this year!scrop of barley in Iraq.     The quantity available is notyet known for certain, but it should ca.nount at least to150,000 tonso     The Ministry of Food have agreed thatany amounts obtained under this transaction which aresurplus to the minimum requirements from this area,estimated at about 70,000 tons over the year, of Pale-. stino and other Middle East territories, should bei   shipped to India.      The maximum capacity of the port of Basra is only about 25-30,000 tons a month, andthis barley is not yet available for shipment but it ispossible that some quantity at any rate might beobtained for India for arrival there before the end ofOctober.(d) It might be possible to speed up shipments of rice toIndia from Siam.     At any rate the Special commissioner in South East Asia might be informed of the dangerous situation which will arise in India next month, andinstructed to make every effort to maximise shipments of rice to India during the next few weeks.(e) The complicated and delicate negotiations with the indonesian and Dutch authorities for the export office from Java to India should be concluded as speedilyas possible.      It seems unlikely, however, that greater quantities can be obtained from this source forarrival in India before the end of October than havealready been taken into account in the aependix tothis note.6.     In view of the time factor, it seems unlikely that anyof the measures suggested in paragraph 5 above can have mucheffect on the situation in India during September, thoughit/

-4-it is to bo hoped that a substantial contribution maybe available from those additional sources of supply to ease the Government of India&apos;s position in October.   Theonly further expedient which seems possible with a viewto avert disaster in India scorns to be an appeal to theUnited States to make further supplies available forIndia this month in addition to the 80,000 tons of wheat and flour which they are already providing, but if additional supplies from America are to arrive in timeto help in September they must bo shipped at onco3 or at any rate during the next fortnight. If a further100,000 tons could be obtained this month or early next month from the United States, it might, in conjunctionwith all the other measures indicated above, enable theGovernment of India to tide over the situation and prevent a major disaster until the end of October, after whichthe improvement in internal procurement in India from november onwards as a result of the autumn harvests in southern India may enable the Government of Indiasuccessfully to weather the storm.India Office,7th August, 1946.

The availability of rice from Java is alsoextremely uncertain.(3)   Arrivals from Australia have been calculated in thecase-of cargoes whose approximate sailing dates arealready known on the basis of dates of arrival estimated by the Ministry of Transport and in the case of the september programme on the assumption that the total quantity covered by the latter will reach India during october.   The other figures for arrivals have been estimated by allowing six weeks for the voyage fromthe U. S.-A. , Canada, Brazil and the Argentine, four weeks from siam and Java, three weeks from Egypt and two weeks from Burma.
