this document is the PROPERTY of his britannic majesty&apos;s government   &quot;----.----mPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1946.SECRET. Copy No.     35CP. (46) 331.30th August, 1946.CABINET.BRITISH NATIONALITY LAW.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department.AT their meeting on the 1st August (CM. (46) 76th Conclusions, Minute 9)the Cabinet agreed to appoint a Committee under my Chairmanship to consider and report on the following major questions of policy arising out of the passageof the Canadian Citizenship Act, 1946 : (a) whether the United Kingdom should participate in the new citizenshipsystem and, if so,(b) what form that participation should take;(c) in connection with the latter point, the manner in which the UnitedKingdom, the Colonies, India, Burma, Newfoundland and SouthernRhodesia should be brought within the new citizenship scheme;(d) certain special difficulties arising in connection with Eire.2. The Committee have now agreed upon their recommendations on thesequestions and I deal with them in turn below.(a) Should the United Kingdom participate in the new citizenship system?3. The Canadian Act introduces, so far as Canada is concerned, a funda-mental change in the existing system of British nationality law. Under thesystem which has hitherto existed the law which has determined what persons are British subjects has been contained in the provisions of a common code.Under this code British nationality was conferred directly without reference tolocal citizenship. The Canadian Act proceeds upon the quite different principlethat the status of British subject shall be conferred through the gateway of localcitizenship, and that it is for each country of the Commonwealth to determine what shall be the conditions for admission to its citizenship.4. The Committee attach great importance to the maintenance of thecommon status of British subject unimpaired throughout the Commonwealth.Unless the maintenance of this common status is put upon a new and agreedbasis in place of the system which has broken down, there is a danger that oneor more of the Dominions may in the future be disposed to drop the commonstatus altogether and give way to demands from within for completely separatenationhood.5. There are, moreover, certain positive advantages in the new citizenshipplan. As was pointed out in the Annex to CP. (46) 305, the great disadvantage of the common code has been that no substantial amendment of that code couldbe effected by any member of the Commonwealth without the prior agreementof all the other members. This rigidity has given rise to prolonged delays and,in some cases, to virtual abandonment of much needed amendments of the law.On the other hand, under the new system whilst the citizenship laws of all thecountries of the Commonwealth will be based upon common principles therewill be room for local divergencies. The present uniform rigidity will disappearand with it the necessity for obtaining the agreement of all the countries of theCommonwealth before one of those countries can amend its nationality laws inany particular affecting the common status of British subject. Again, the new plan will provide a convenient definition in the form of local citizenship of[32322]
those persons belonging to the various countries of the Commonwealth, includingthe United Kingdom and Colonies, and this will be of distinct advantage fortreaty-making purposes.6. The Committee are, therefore, agreed that there is no practicable alternative but for the United Kingdom to participate in the new citizenshipsystem.(b) What form should that participation take ?(c) In particular, in what manner should the United Kingdom, the Colonies,India, Burma and Southern Rhodesia be brought within the new citizen-ship system ?7. These two inter-related questions may be conveniently considered together.The Committee recognise that United Kingdom participation in the newcitizenship scheme is complicated by the problem of the treatment to be accorded to the Colonies. Only two solutions to the Colonial problem are in any waypracticable. Against the first of these solutions, viz., the creation of a citizen-ship for the United Kingdom and a separate citizenship for each Colony, theSecretary of State for the Colonies has advanced serious objections on grounds of Colonial policy.8. In view of these objections, the Committee are convinced that the solu-tion which should be adopted is the creation in United Kingdom legislation of a combined citizenship of the United Kingdom and the Colonies which wouldbe the gateway through which the status of British subject should be conferred upon the inhabitants of both the United Kingdom and the Colonies. Anyperson who fulfilled the conditions for this citizenship, whether by birth in theUnited Kingdom or any of the Colonies, would be a &quot; citizen of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies.&quot;9. The Committee recognise the obvious objections to this omnibus andsomewhat unwieldy term, and, though the question of nomenclature has already received careful consideration, the Secretary of State for the Colonies has undertaken to give further consideration to it in the hope of producing a more convenient term. This consideration, however, in no way qualifies the Com-mittee&apos;s recommendation of the solution of combined citizenship of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies.10. While the future of India is to some extent rendered obscure by thepresent constitutional negotiations, the Committee are agreed that if she is toremain within the Commonwealth, India should be given the opportunity ofparticipating in the new citizenship system as a separate country of the Common-wealth having the right to enact her own citizenship and nationality laws, andthat a similar course should, in any event, be taken in the case of Burma. Thiswill involve in both cases an amendment of the 1935 Acts under which theirexisting constitutions were established, as at present neither India nor Burmahave the right to pass legislation affecting British nationality.11. The Committee also recommend that Newfoundland and SouthernRhodesia should be brought within the framework of the new system as countrieshaving the right to enact their own citizenship legislation.12. If these countries are to have the right to enact their own citizenshiplegislation, it is clearly desirable that all four countries, viz., India, Burma,Newfoundland and Southern Rhodesia, should be invited to send representatives to the experts conference which is to be held in the autumn to discuss nationalityquestions of common concern with particular reference to the situation created by the Canadian Act.(d) The method of solution of certain special difficulties arising from theanomalous position of Eire.13.. Under the existing law an anomalous position exists with regard tothe status of Eire citizens. Under Eire law, Eire citizens are not British subjects.On the other hand, Eire citizens are, with few exceptions, recognised as Britishsubjects under United Kingdom law by virtue of birth, &amp;e, within His Majesty&apos;sdominions. This anomalous position has met with strong criticism fromMr. De Valera who objects to the United Kingdom Government regarding eire citizens as British subjects.
14. Under the new citizenship plan, United Kingdom legislation would,in the absence of any special provisions made for the purpose, no longer recogniseEire citizens as British subjects and the present cause of friction with the eire Government would thereby be removed.15. It must be borne in mind, however, that there are at present many eire citizens who are proud of their status as British subjects and would stronglyresent the loss of that status under the new United Kingdom legislation. Themost satisfactory method of dealing with these persons would be a provision in the United Kingdom legislation which would prevent any person who was aBritish subject under United Kingdom law at the date of the coming into opera-tion of the new citizenship legislation from losing that status.16. In addition, it would be possible to provide that Eire citizens who were actually resident in this country or the Colonies when the new legislation came into force or were in the service of the Crown could acquire citizenship of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies forthwith without undue formality.17. These provisions would not, however, cover the case of Eire citizensborn after the date of the coming into force of the new legislation. The best method of dealing with this class would seem to be the insertion of provisions in the new legislation on strict condition of reciprocity (machinery for which already exists under Eire legislation) under which Eire citizens born after thedate of the coming into force of the new legislation, though not British subjects,would be given all the rights of British subjects whilst they were in this country or the Colonies.Conclusions.18. Accordingly, we would suggest that our colleagues should approve ofthe arrangements for the forthcoming conference of experts from the UnitedKingdom and the Dominions being completed and that the instructions to theUnited Kingdom representatives should be settled on the basis of the following conclusions :  (1) that the United Kingdom should participate in the new citizenshipsystem;(2) that this should be done by the creation in United Kingdom legislation of a combined citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies whichwould be the gateway through which the common status of british subject should be conferred upon the inhabitants of both the UnitedKingdom and the Colonies;(3) that India (if she is to remain within the Commonwealth), Burma,Newfoundland and Southern Rhodesia should be brought within the framework of the new system as countries having the right to enacttheir own citizenship legislation;(4) that India, Burma, Newfoundland and Southern Rhodesia should beinvited to send representatives to the experts conference;(5) that in the United Kingdom citizenship legislation the status of british subject should not be automatically conferred upon Eire citizensagainst the wishes of the Eire Government, but that in order to avoid the hardship which would otherwise result from this new situation under which Eire citizens will no longer be British subjects under united Kingdom law, the experts conference should work out detailed provisions for insertion in the new legislation on the following lines : (i) a saving clause to preserve the status as British subjects under united Kingdom law of Eire citizens born before the new legislation comes into force;(ii) a provision to enable Eire citizens in the service of the Crownor resident in the United Kingdom or the Colonies when theInew legislation comes into force to acquire citizenship of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies without undue formality,(iii) a provision (on condition of reciprocity) which would give eire citizens born after the new legislation comes into force all therights of British subjects whilst they are in the UnitedKingdom or the Colonies.J.
