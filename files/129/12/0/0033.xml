i   /f-J3-  .o hry^.150THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET COPY NO.CP. (46 )  5552ND SEPTEMBER,  1946CABINET7^GERMAN coal memorandum by the Lord Privy SealOn the 1st August the Cabinet considered (CM. (46) 76thConclusions, Minute 10) a memorandum by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster  (CP. (46) 316) regarding the proportion ofGerman coal production that should be retained for use in theBritish, American and French Zones and the proportion that should be made available for export during the month ofSeptember.      They decided that since the quadripartiteCommittee of Experts, which had been appointed by the control council on the instructions of the Council of Foreign ministers to examine methods of increasing coal production and to putforward principles in regard to allocations had not yetcompleted their report,  no drastic cut in exports from theBritish Zone to the countries represented in the European CoalOrganisation should take place during September and that these should be   maintained at approximately the current monthlylevel of 950,000 tons.2.        It had been anticipated that the report of the Committeeof Experts would be available for consideration before adecision had to be taken on the coal export allocation for the subsequent period, but owing to divergences of view in theCommittee this report will not now be ready in time.3.        We are therefore faced with the urgent need to reach adecision on the line which our representative should take atthe Quadripartite Fuel Committee which will be held in Berlinlater in the week to consider the export allocations for the months of October, November and December.4,      &apos; The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in his paperreferred to the urgent need to retain more coal for consumption in the British Zone,  and pointed out that unless this was done it would not be possible to carry into effect the declaration onHis Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s policy which was made by the foreign secretary in Paris in July, namely that    unless Germany was treated as an economic unit the British Zone would be organised in such a way as to eliminate the burden which the British tax payer is at present called upon to bear.      More recently the British Commander-in-Chief has telegraphed expressing hisserious concern about the declining economy of the british zone owing to the shortage of coal and pointing out that thisdecline is already having serious repercussions on thepolitical situation.5.        In the view of the British Element of the control commission a minimum quantity of 4,200,000 tons of coal(British Zone 2,500,000 tons) is required in the three western Zones which represents about 1 million tons per month more than current allocations.      If this demand

were regarded as a first charge on coal production itwould result in a virtual cessation of. coal exports to thecountries represented on the European Coal Organisation.The question of a temporary moratorium on coal exportswas considered by the Overseas Reconstruction Committee onthe 21st June (O.R.0.(46) 9th Meeting) and it was decided that though this was clearly the sound economic course it wouldnot be   politically possible to c&amp;vvy it out save withquadripartite agreement,  or at least full American support.In the light of this decision I make the following proposals as to the line which our representative should take duringthe forthcoming allocation meeting in Berlin; -(1)    That despite the desirability of allocating ona three-monthly basis we should allocate for october only in view of the fact that the expert Committee has not yet completed it0,report.      We should hope that this would beavailable before deciding on November and december allocations.(2)    That a minimum Quantity of 3,800,000 tons shouldbe retained for consumption in the three western Zones.6.        Coal available in the three Western Zones in October,(including certain residual pithead stocks) is estimatedat 4,900,000 tons.      If the above recommendation is acceptedthere would therefore remain 1,100,000 tons (including100,000 tons from the Saar) to meet the demands of theE, CO,  countries, Austria, Berlin and our commitments underthe barter transaction with the Russian Zone for browncoal and power.      The last three together require about500,000 tons which would mean a balance available to E.C.O.of 600,000 tons against the current monthly export figureof 950,000 tons.      There is no doubt that a reduction in the monthly rate of exports of this order of magnitude would meet with strenuous opposition from the Powers represented on E. CO.  and in particular from France.      Although theFrench are beginning to re&amp;lise that some reduction in exports may be necessary in order to achieve an increasein coal production,  they are thinking in terms of much smaller figures than 350,000 tons.      We are informed byBerlin that the Americans and the French have tentativelyagreed this reduction at 150,000 tons,      notwithstanding the objections which we shall undoubtedly meet with fromthe E. CO.  Powers I feel most strongly that the time hascome when we must make a decision to retain more coal foruse in our Zone.      The political and economic necessity forsuch action has    impressed itself on all observers,  includingthe Select Committee on Estimates,  who made it one of themain pillars of their Report.      I therefore hope that mycolleagues will agree to instructions being given to our representative to inform his colleagues in the Allied control commission that the quantities of coal available for export to the E.C.O.  Powers from the British Zone during Octoberwill be only 500,000 tons.      This, with the 100,000 tons which is normally available from the idaar, will make 600,000tons for the month.

7.        I should,  I think,   draw the attention of my colleagues to the fact that the reduction in exports will fall upon-the E.G.O.  Powers only, while the -Austrian allocation ofabout 200,000 tons per month will be maintained.      We shallundoubtedly be told by the E. 0.0.   countries that if somecut in export allocations    is necessary that cut should beborne equally by all the countries concerned, whetheror not they are members of E.C.0,      Although there is logicin this claim I think we should resist at this stage anycut in the export allocation to Austria.      At the present justice, when we are doing our best to encourage the weakAustrian Government to stand up to severe economic andpolitical penetration by the Russians,  it would be disastrous to reduce our  shipments by even a small amount.      Theseshipments are already inadequate to meet Austria&apos;s minimumneeds and the small gain to the E.G.6.  countries would be entirely disproportionate to the sacrifice exacted fromthe Austrian economy;    the political reaction in Austriawould be even more serious.A.G.Gwydyr House, S.W.1.2ND SEPTEMBER,   1946.
