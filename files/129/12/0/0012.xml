THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTHE SIZE OF THE ROYAL AIR FORCE AT THE END OF 1946Memorandum by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Air.. THE Defence Committee has already considered (D.O. (46) 91) the difficultiesnow facing the Army, which will involve slowing up their releases during thelast quarter of this year. The Air Council have similarly had under review theprospects for the Royal Air Force and I attach an appreciation of the situationup to the end of 1946.. In view of the serious situation which this discloses, Ihave to ask approval for an increase of 25,000 in the ceiling fixed for the R.A.F.at the end of the year and for a release programme which will permit the demobilisation of no more than an average of one Group during each month ofthe last quarter, i.e., to take the general level of release in the ground trades nofurther than Group 47 by the end of the year.2. Before the end of the year, it should be possible to put forward longer-term proposals which would show how quickly this increase over the existingauthorised ceiling of 305,000 could be dispensed with, but at the moment it isonly possible to put forward stop-gap proposals for keeping the Air Force togetherat the height of the demobilisation programme.3. Though the increase in numbers is not large, I fully recognise that anyretardation of release will cause grave heartburnings, both inside and outsidethe R.A.F. There seems, however, to be no way of avoiding it. The situation will, of course, to some extent be eased by the fact that developments abroadhave demanded a proportionately greater retardation in the Army. It was, more-over, made clear both in the Prime Minister&apos;s speech on defence on the 4th Marchand in the White Paper on the Call-up to the Forces in 1947 and 1948 (Cmd. 6831)that unforeseen developments, and particularly the rate of entry of volunteers for the regular forces, might lead to a revision in either direction of the estimateson which our arrangements for demobilisation are based.4. I do not, however, need to emphasise the importance of giving the R.A.F.and the public a clear warning in good time of these changes in our programme.I would remind the Cabinet that the numbers due to be released from the R.A.F.by the end of the year under the &quot; Statement relating to Defence &quot; (Cmd. 6743)can be broadly estimated from data already published. There is no doubt that members of the R.A.F. and their families are confidently expecting a higher levelof release than Group 47 by the end of the year.Printed for the Cabinet.

2Memorandum.WHEN the Air Ministry explained in D.O. (46) 66 the anticipated positionof the Royal Air Force at the 31st December, 1946, on the basis of a man-powerceiling of 305,000 it was made clear that the process of demobilisation wouldinvolve a period of unbalance which would be expensive in man-power and would bring the efficiency of the Service to a very low level. This unbalance has provedworse than was foreseen, and the plans then made are no longer proving workable.2. In the first place it has proved that the commitment for training andretraining, though it was always recognised as formidable, was neverthelessunder-estimated. This is to be attributed, to a large extent, to re-engagementsof trained men proving fewer than were expected. Secondly, the loss of effectiveman-power involved in the large-scale reorganisation and regrouping of the force is proving larger than was foreseen. The embarrassments caused by these two factors have been accentuated by a number of other factors, e.g.: *(a) The prolongation of occupational commitments in the Mediterranean.(b) Delays in transferring Air Transport Services to Civil Aviation.(c) The need to allow for airmen to take the place of civilian employees whowill be left behind on the move to the Canal Zone.id) Failure to obtain prisoners of war up to the numbers expected in replace-ment of airmen and restriction on the employment of those allocated,(e) An unavoidable increase in the strength of the RA.F. Regiment.3. The state of unbalance in the Royal Air Force is illustrated by thefollowing figures. Next month there will be deficiencies in fitters and flightmechanics of 25 per cent., in instrument trades 23 per cent., and in electricians22 per cent. Overseas Commands will be 32 per cent, short of wireless operatorsbecause of ineligibility for service overseas. These deficiencies will be increasedby the end of the year.4. There are still in the R.A.F. some 290 different trades and aircrewcategories. The periods of training required in them vary from 18 months ormore downwards. A substantial deficiency in any one of these trades would impair the effectiveness of many of the rest, e.g., if a manning deficiency limits the maintenance of radio aids all flying over a large area may be seriously affected.To disregard such a factor is to invite a rise in the accident rate.5. It is essential to keep the force flying. To put the majority of the forceinto cold storage until the period of reorganisation is over would not only mean that the Government had at its disposal less than the bare minimum needed toprotect the country&apos;s interests, but that the period of reorganisation would beindefinitely prolonged. Unless units are kept flying, officers and men cannot begiven training and experience to compensate for the flow of experienced personnelout of the service.6. When plans were made earlier in the year, it was assumed thatre-engagements would number 45,000 by the end of the year. In fact, after theBounty Scheme has been in operation two months, re-engagements number only,000. An immediate result of a short fall in trained volunteers is, of course,that our minimum strength can only be maintained by keeping on more conscripts.It has also, however, the secondary result of increasing the training commitment.Instead of the Service recovering, say, a trained fitter under the re-engagementscheme, an airman in some other trade or a new recruit must be trained as a fitter.This involves increasing training establishments and even training an extra supplyof instructors.7. Experience now shows that the effective man-power lost in reorganisationwas under-estimated. A contraction of the force on the scale now being under-taken involves a vast volume of postings both at home and between home and overseas commands, if the units that remain are to be kept at any standard of
efficiency. This, in addition to the numbers of men in transit for demobilisation,inevitably means that large numbers of men and women are ineffective at any given moment. The time lost in drafting and movements can normally beestimated with a fair degree of accuracy, but events have shown that in ourearlier calculations we were not sufficiently pessimistic on this head. It is now clear that the allowance for non-effectiveness should be increased very substantially above the figure of 2\ per cent, originally calculated.8. The cumulative effect of these factors is to involve a substantially increased man-power commitment and an overhaul of our plans has therefore been carried out to reduce this as far as possible. A number of savings havebeen effected, at the cost partly of sacrificing measures designed to improve airsafety, but primarily of reducing still further the proportion of the front line which can be kept effective and of increasing the time during which this state will persist. It has been found impossible at present to budget for the increasedallowance for non-effectiveness which is undoubtedly required, and this can only have the effect of further reducing efficiency all round. Details are given in an appendix of the deployment resulting as compared&apos; with that previously planned.9. The seriousness of the situation which is thus produced was fore-shadowed in D.O. (46) 66, but the following examples will illustrate the inadequacy of the front line and the risks involved in postponing its rehabilitation-tion. Even if the Cabinet agrees to the proposal I am submitting in paragraph 11,I see no prospect that the number of regular day fighter squadrons that can bemaintained in the United Kingdom can exceed nine. Similarly, of the long-range Bomber Squadrons in the RA.F. it will not be possible to man morethan 10 and it is doubtful if more than four can be kept at anything approachingoperational efficiency. Bomber Command will no longer be available as an effective offensive weapon to back our diplomacy or to act as a deterrent to aggresion.10. In general, it must be emphasised that the Government has at its disposal no reserve of air power whatsoever to deal with contingencies. Eventhe comparatively small commitments recently involved in precautionary measures against attacks on British lives and property in&apos;South Persia can only be under-taken with the greatest difficulty and at the expense of the arrangements for reinforcing India with Air Transport Squadrons in the event of trouble. Iftwo such commitments should arise together, one of them could not be met.Squadrons engaged on such tasks cannot operate at less than full efficiency, and unless sufficient trained personnel can be made available to man the squadronsand the trunk route organisation, our ability to fulfil such commitments will be seriously prejudiced.11. In these circumstances the 31st December, 1946, proves too early a date for reducing the strength of the R.A.F. to 305,000 and a postponement is inevitable. Authority is therefore sought for setting the RAT. ceiling at the31st December at 330,000 and for adjusting the demobilisation programme forthe RAT. so as not to go beyond Group 47 at the end of the year for groundtrades.[p.t.o.
