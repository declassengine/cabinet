(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (46) 52415th August. 1.946 COPY NO    3^CABINETRECRUITMENT FOR THE INDIAN CIVIL SERVICE AND_THE INDIAN POLICE__Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.This question was discussed on July 16th by the PrimeMinister and the members of the Cabinet Mission to India,and later, on July 31st, by the India and Burma Committee(I.B.(46) 3rd Meeting).     As a result a telegram was sentto the Viceroy giving him a strong lead in. the directionof closing down both European and Indian recruitment to the Indian Civil Service and the Indian Police and ofcancelling the offers already made to 73 &quot;war service&quot;candidates.      I attach for reference (Annexuro I) a copyof this telegram, which was circulated at the time to theGfebinet.2.     The Viceroy&apos;s reply has now been received and I attach a copy (Annexure II).     It will be seen that he and his council agree that recruitment to these services should cease forthwith and the offers of appointment already made should be cancelled.3,     It will, of course, be necessary to inform the candidates concerned as soon as possible and immediatelyafterwards to issue a public announcement.      This islikely to attract a good deal of attention both in thePress- and. in Parliament in view of the following:(a) It is capable of being represented as Impairing theefficiency of the administration of India.(b) _0ji.J2th.JFe.brua.ry- last it was publicly announced thatwe did not propose to hold in abeyance the &quot;war service&quot; scheme of recruitment instituted by the lastgovernment.(c) 73 offers of appointment have been made and 54accepted, and successful candidates were expected tosail for India next month.     Incidentally in thisconnection the question of compensating them will arise, but the sum is not likely to be large.The main arguments which in the view of myself and theI. &amp; B. Committee override the foregoing objection are contained in the telegrams in Annexures I and II.I accordingly attach a draft of the public announce-

merit which I propose to make (Annexure III) and ask mycolleagues&apos; concurrence in its issue.P.-L.India Office,13th August, 1946

AIMPORTANT.No. 14-186.Secret.   Recruitment to war reserved vacancies in the Indian Civil Service (including indian political Service) and Indian police.2, I have now seen summary of Provincial Governmentsreplies to your enquiry on future European recruitment and have also consulted my colleagues on the matter.3.     In view of the resentment which appointment offurther Europeans to the I.C.S. and I. P. would belikely to provoke in India and of the fact that the reinforcement of I.C. S. and L Po by Europeanrecruits likely to be forthcoming from the warreserved recruitment scheme would not substantiallycontribute to maintenance of efficiency of administrative machine during period before transferof power in India, we are strongly of opinion thatrecruitment of Europeans for Secretary of State&apos;services should cease forthwith, and that offers of appointment which have already been made to 73European candidates under war reserved recruitmentscheme should be cancelled although this will necessitate grant of some degree of compensation inmost cases. Ghat is except insofar as we can providefor suitable alternative service elsewhere.4.     As regards recruitment of Indians you willprobably agree that it recruitment of Europeans is^abandoned there will be no case for appointment ofany more Indians to Secretary of State&apos;s Services.It might well be represented as unjustifiable toincrease the number of Indians who will have a claimto compensation in respect of termination of theirappointment under the Secretary of state when thiscomes about.   The deficiencies of personnel mightwell be made good by appointment of Indians to services under the control of Governments in india on salaries and conditions of service laid down bythem, possibly in consultation, where required, withyourself and the Interim Government,   Such a changehowever could scarcely be made if recruitment of europeans to Secretary of State&apos;s services were continued, as it would be argued that this involvesracial discrimination.   I presume that you will wishto consult Provincial Governments on this aspect ofthe matter and I should be glad if you would do so/andCOPY OF TELEGRAM FROM SECRETARY OF STATE TO VICEROY,_     DATED 2ND AUGUST, 1946.__

and telegraph your conclusions as soon as you can.5.     As selection process is less far advanced in Indiathan in this country, need for very early decision is less in respect of Indian recruitment than it is inrespect of European recruitment.   But it is clearlyundesirable that this should be delayed longer than canbe avoided, and really urgent need for final decision in regard to European recruitment leads me to ask you to telegraph your views on that point as quickly aspossible.

COPY OF TELEGRAM FROM VICEROY TO SECRETARY OF STATE__DATED 11TH AUGUST 1946._IMPORTANT.1658S.Your telegram   14186 dated August 2nd.    subject was discussed in Council on 7th on a paper ofHome Department which had already been consideringquestion.   Official intimation may take some timebut substance of decision was that recruitment ofboth Europeans and Indians to Secretary of Stale&apos;services should cease forthwith and that offers of appointment already made should be cancelled.    Nooffers have been made in India and question ofcompensation does not therefore arise in respectof Indians to be recruited here.   Decision regardingIndians was taken on grounds indicated by you and inconsideration of fact that 5 Provincial Governments   -had given their opinion against all further recruitment,3 of them specifying Indians as well as Europeans.Proposals for filling war vacancies were also considered by Council which decided to establish a central service under Government of India givingprovinces the opportunity of sharing in a jointcadre with Central Government or alternatively the(corrupt group) qualifying for deputation from centre for service in provinces.   Details are being worked out.
