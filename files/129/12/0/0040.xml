B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1.9th September, 1946.ANNEX.Directive for Commander-in-Chief on Policy to be pursued in British zone in anticipation of meeting of council of foreign ministers on germany in November.1. Introduction.His Majesty&apos;s Governments long-term policy with regard to Germany is : (i) To establish political conditions which will secure the world against any German reversion to dictatorship and any revival of Germanaggressive policy.(ii) To establish economic conditions which will enable Germans and theworld outside Germany to benefit from German industry and resourceswithout re-establishing the economic foundations of an aggressivepolicy.(iii) To establish constitutional machinery in Germany which will ensurethese ends and which will be acceptable to the German people andthus have the best chance of reasonable permanence.(iv) To encourage from now onwards the maximum responsibility for and interest in political, administrative and economic developments ondemocratic lines on the part of the Germans themselves.13535   [32354] B
2. Objectives.(i) Germany as a whole.The constitutional objective to which His Majesty&apos;s Government are working in Germany as a whole is the establishment of a fully decentralised system,consisting of regional units (Lander) with the widest possible powers, and a central elected government with exclusive or overriding powers on such matters as are reserved to it.The future German State under this system would approximate more nearlyto the Bundesstaat (Federal) than to the Staatenbund (Confederate) model. Theadvantages of the system are :  (a) That it can be encouraged to grow most naturally within the framework of the present &quot; zonal &quot; form of government and can so be encouraged to grow immediately;(b) that it is consistent with as much economic unity of Germany as isnecessary, without opening the door to the political uniformity orparty dictatorship which appears to be the Russian aim; and(c) That it should serve to interest the maximum number of Germans indemocratic politics and administration, would be a return to thefederal system which was swept away finally by the Nazis when theycreated the Einheitsstaat (Unitary State) and would mobilise localas opposed to national patriotism without repelling progressiveGerman opinion by the appearance of a revival of the 18th century&quot; Kleinstaaterei.&quot;The United States Government have already established three Lander intheir zone which may become regional units in a decentralised system. TheFrench Government are in favour of a federal system for Germany aimed at theprevention at all costs of the growth of a unitary, powerful Germany whichwould threaten French security. The Belgian and Netherlands Governments arealso in favour of a federal system, though it is not certain whether they go sofar as the French Government in desiring the decentralisation of powers fromthe centre. The Soviet Government are opposed to a federal system and are apparently working for the establishment of a centralised Germany which they hope to dominate both economically and politically directly and through the medium of the Communist and the Socialist Unity Parties.(ii) British ZoneThe objectives of His Majesty&apos;s Government within the British zone are :-(a) To establish Lander, on the model of that already established as theNorth Rhine-Westphalia land, which may serve as constituent units in the future German State;(b) To hasten the devolution of power to Germans as far and as fast aspossible within the minimum limitations imposed by the need for security and Allied interests;(c) To encourage the formation and efficient  functioning of  Germanrepresentative bodies and a sense of political and social security;(d) Within the same limits to ensure that power is not only devolved toGermans but at the same time decentralised territorially; and(e) To establish a reasonable standard of living and economic well-beingwithout building up too powerful an industrial organisation.(iii) North Rhine-Westphalia Land.The objective of His Majesty&apos;s Government within this land is (a) To achieve security by a Western international military occupation ofthe area west of the Rhine, and by a further international control,economic and military, of the inner area of the province east of the rhine containing the key industries;(&amp;) To increase the level of production in the key industries (which cannotbe achieved without the confidence and willing collaboration of theGermans) for the benefit of Europe as a whole.
184For the purpose of 2 (iii) : (/) The nature and timing of the international or other control on theindustries within the inner or special area of the North Rhine-Westphalia Land : the nature and timing of the international military control of the same area : the relations of these two forms of controlwith each other and their joint relationship with the internationalmilitary occupation to be established on the west bank of the Rhine;the relationship of the international control with the various echelonsof German government and the industrial corporations set up tocontrol the principal industries of the area; the relationship of theforces contemplated by the draft United States Treaty on Disarma-ment with the injjernational forces west of the Rhine and with the . .international and^the internationaljmilitary controfeof the Ruhr. 1^^**^^^^^It is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to consult as fully as possible with the Americans and the Western Powers on our policy in Germany and onthe above matters in particular before the Council meets. Even if it is notpossible to secure agreement on our objectives and the means of attaining them,we can at least ensure that our motives and actions are not misunderstood. Priorinformal discussion with the Russians in Berlin on the matters set out insubparagraphs (&amp;), (c), (d) and (e) above would, if opportunity offers, be desirable in order to elicit their intentions as far as possible.(ii) Devolution and decentralisation.For the purposes of 2 (ii) : It is important to proceed swiftly not only in order to save British man-power and to give the Germans a vested interest and responsibility for their ownafiairs (the first step in political education) but also in order to encourage themore democratic parties at the Gemeinde and Kreis elections and to set an example for the other occupying Powers; it is essential that before the Councilmeets His Majesty&apos;s Government should have reached firm conclusions and taken,where possible, definite action on matters relating to devolution and clecentralisa-hon in the British zone so that the application of these measures may not beheld up by disagreements at the meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers.[32354] b 23. Immediate Problems and Considerations(i) Preparation for meeting of Council of Foreign Ministers.Before the Council meets to discuss Germany (i.e.. before November) it is1essential that His Majesty&apos;s Government should have clarified its views on themeans of attaining the objectives set out in paragraph 2 (i) and (iii) above andshould have made considerable progress towards attaining those inparagraph 2 (ii) above.For the purpose of 2 (i).His Majesty&apos;s Government must determine as soon and as precisely aspossible its views on (a) The future boundaries of Germany as a whole, taking into account claimsalready made or to be expected from France, Belgium, Luxembourg,the Netherlands, Denmark, Poland and possibly Czechoslovakia (thefirst five of these will be asked by us to formulate any claims as soonas possible);(6) The number and probable boundaries of the Lander which should formconstituent elements of a decentralised German state;(c) The constitutional character of a German Central Government, the stageat and conditions in which it should be set up;(d) The exact division of powers between the central government and thegovernments of the various constituent units;(e) The means (including the provisions of a Treaty of Peace) whereby theGerman people as a Whole can be induced to associate themselves with the establishment and preservation of a constitution of the typecontemplated (including consideration of the checks necessary to limit the extent to which the central government can take over or encroachupon the powers allocated to the governments of the Lander).
* It is recognised that the maintenance of maximum economic efficiency at atime of continuing economic crisis and the fusion now in progress with theUnited States zone may create special problems in the process of devolution anddecentralisation. But it is essential that any difficulties which these problems maycreate should not be regarded as insuperable obstacles. Even where nodecentralisation is temporarily or permanently possible, power can still be devolved to a German chain of authority.For these purposes solutions must be found or indicated for the followingproblems within the British zone : (g) The number and boundaries of further Lander, with nominated govern-ments, in that part of the British zone which lies outside the newLand North Rhine-Westphalia.(h) The holding of elections in the Lander as soon as circumstances permit.(i) The devolution of governmental powers and responsibility to the nomi-nated governments of the new Lander (and their subordinateauthorities); the determination of the powers of these governments inrelation on the one hand to Military Government authorities (distinc-tion between reserved and unreserved powers), and on the other hand to the newly-constituted inter-zonal German agencies.(k) The inevitability or desirability of speeding up the political and adminis-trative fusion with the United States zone as a consequence ofeconomic fusion.(I) The need for any zonal representative council (assuming the politicalfusion with, the United States zone is not immediately desirable orpracticable) and its relation with any corresponding body in theUnited States zone.(m) The formation or more efficient functioning of German representativeagencies outside the strictly governmental (Central or Land) sphere(e.g., trades unions, works councils, &amp;c).(iii) Economic points.The following economic subjects require consideration prior to the meetingof the Council of Foreign Ministers on Germany : (n) The need for a revision of the Potsdam Agreement and/or the Level ofIndustry Plan with a view to bettering economic conditions inGermany.[o) Whether the three Western zones should make continuing reparation deliveries from current production and, if so, over what period&apos;?Should such deliveries be additional to the once for all deliveriesenvisaged under the Level of Industry Plan or in partial substitution of them ?(p) The need for financial reform in Germany, its timing and nature.(q) Our future policy as regards dismantling of reparation plant and theprovision to reparation claimant powers of urgently needed items of industrial plant.(r) Should we seek the immediate establishment of a single Germany 01should we maintain the independence of the Combined Anglo-American Zone until it has achieved greater political and economic stability? How long would it take to achieve economic stability onthe assumption that the Area is allowed to retain the coal it requiresand receive sufficient food imports to maintain a 1,550-calorie per dayration scale? What are the likely implications on the financialliability of the United Kingdom of (i) the immediate establishment ofa unitary Germany and (ii) the maintenance of an independentBritish-United States Zone ?(s) Can we achieve political and economic stability in the Combined Britishand United States Zone without the immediate introduction offinancial reform in that Area ? Can the two Zones be run effectivelyas a separate area without introducing a separate currency?(t) How far is the achievement of our long-term aim to create an eventualindependent Germany prejudiced by the recent transfer to Sovietownership and management of a large number of industrial plants in the eastern Zone? Can this action&quot;by the Russians be regarded assimilar in character to the assumption by the British Commander-in-Chief of the control of the coal, iron and steel industries of the Ruhr?
What grounds have we for rejecting a possible Russian proposal thatthe four powers should participate in the control of both the Sovietacquired industries in their Zone and of the heavy industries in the ruhr ?4. Conclusions.You are therefore requested (i) To report your views as soon as possible on :  (a) The reorganisation of the Lander within the British zone (outsidethe North Rhine-Westphalia Land); and(b) the division of powers between the Lander governments (and sub-sidiary administrative bodies) and the central federal govern-ment.(ii) As soon as your views on these matters have been received and thenecessary consideration and approval has been given in London, toset up with the minimum of delay the new Lander in the british zone with nominated governments. It is urgently necessary that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should be in a position to announce their planswith certainty and in some detail in the House of Commons beforethe Council of Foreign Ministers meets, that is to say about the middleof October.(iii) To decentralise to the maximum extent possible to the elements of theLander (and their subordinate authorities) political and adminis-trative powers.(iv) To ensure that to the maximum extent possible political and adminis-trative responsibility for the exercise of both reserved and unreservedpowers is placed upon Germans,(v) To report as soon as possible on the matters set out in paragraph 3 (i),sub-paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) and (/).(vi) To report as soon as possible on the points set out in paragraph 3 (ii),sub-paragraphs (g), (i), (k), (I) and (ro) above.(vii) To report as soon as possible upon the points mentioned in para-graph 3 (iii), sub-paragraphs (n), (o), (p), (q), (r), (s) and (t).
