Memorandum &quot;by tho Parliamentary Under Secretary ;/of State, The War Office.1. The question of &quot;squatters&quot; occupying hutted canps in various parts of the country is now a natter for concern.2. Jrom the War- Office point of view the problch of infiltrationrelates to two main classes of camp:-(a)    those which have been declared redundant by the FarOffice and thereupon cone under the general arrangement whereby the Minister of Forkr: offers then to otherDepartments;canps retained by the War Office which have been, or are in course of being, reconditioned for the reception of Poles and polish families.CATEGORY A &quot;3. Owing to the rapid run down of the Amy it is impossible toprovide guards of British Troops for the large number of camps involved.Civilian watchkeepers have, however, been used.     These have been brushedaside by the &quot;squatters&quot;. -4. The War Office retains no interest in camps actually transferred tothe Ministry of Works and only a&apos;residual interest in the other redundantoaraps in that the War Office is responsible for final derequisitioning of theland when the huts, etc., have been disposed of by the Ministry of Works orby paying compensation to the owner if huts are left in situ.5. The occupation of those camps does, however, raise the difficultissue of what action, if any, should.bo taken against the &quot;squatters&quot;.     Ifthe local authorities take over these camps with a view to making themhabitable where possible, this may encourage further infiltration.     Thealternative appears&apos; to be to take steps to evict the &quot;squatters&quot;.     Thiswight lead to a difficult situation, especially if, on eviction, the campswore still to remain unoccupied for some considerable time pending adecision by the iginistry of Works or other G-overnnent department as to their future use.6* Certain camps outside earmarked for the poles and their familieshave also been occupied.     These camps are for the most part in process ofbeing reconditioned by Poles for poles.   . Polish units and formations arem process of moving in or are en route for a number of these camps.Clearly a difficult situation may arise with regard to these camps, becausewic advance parties of poles may well resent their being entered by/ &quot;tequattors&quot;(Hi-f ***cob: no.^P.(46 ) 32613th August, 1946.CABINET&quot;SQUATTERS&quot; IN ARI&quot; CA2IPS
&quot;squatters.!1 whilst it is clearly not convenient that units on arrival should find their canps partially occupied by others.7. For the moment, I have arranged for Poles destined for1 ccvjpsoccupied by &quot;squatters&quot; to be diverted to other empty camps.      Clearly this process cannot continue for long and the tine will soon corse when occupiedcanps will be required for the poles and it nay be necessary to evict the&quot;squatters&quot;.8. The question of providing guards to protect these canps has beenconsidered.     As a rough estimate this would take three to four thousand nen,I feel it would bo difficult to nount polish guards since awkward politicalquestions night arise if homeless British subjects were held up by polesfrom entering enpty canps. &apos;   The necessary British troops are not available,No margin of any sort now exists in the U.K. to deal with events of this nature except by adopting the undesirable course of taking troops away from training which would ncan using young and inexperienced soldiers.I do not believe that it is a task in any case suitable for young andinexperienced soldiers involving as it night the possibility of clasheswith the civil population.     In addition to take these nen away fron their training now means that they will not be able to take the place at the end ofthe normal six months of nen being released.9. Unless a clear statement on Government policy is announced early,there will be a widespread infiltration into empty camps for which there isstill a War Office or other departmental commitment .and which thereforewill necessitate eventual eviction.10. I do not feel that eviction of homeless British families in favourof polish troops and especially polish families or c.g., prisoners of war would command public support.     The alternative nay be the. retention of premises now scheduled for derequisition and or some measure of new construction to meet inescapable commitments.11. In ray opinion the pro sent illegal situation should not beallowed to continue.     I therefore recommend as regards redundant camps thatthe position should be regularised so that &quot;squatters&quot; can remain unless theyare to be evicted,, and as regards those camps where there is a definiteGovernment commitment for poles or otherwise the necessity should be facedeither for eviction or a suspension of derequisitioning and a possible measure of new construction.N. of C.
