THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1946.SECRET. Copy No,CP. (46) 304.2Qth July, 1946.CABINET.FUTURE OF THE ASSYRIANS IN IRAQ AND SYRIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE time has now come when a definite decision about the future of the assyrians in Iraq and Syria must be taken. When the matter was discussed by the caretaker Government in July 1945. they directed that further enquiry should be made into the possibility of settling these Assyrians in Eritrea,Cyrenaica, Lebanon or Baluchistan. Reports on all these possibilities have nowbeen received and show that they are all entirely impracticable. The position must, therefore, be faced that after exhaustive search, no- suitable place for theseAssyrians has been found in non-British territory. Unless, therefore, they canbe resettled in the British Colonial Empire, they will have to stay in Iraq and syria, and we shall have to accept the risk of serious conflict arising betweenthem and their Moslem fellow-citizens.2.   The two decisions that are now possible are thus : (1) The Cabinet may direct that a suitable area must be found for them inthe British Colonial Empire in spite of the difficulties and the initialcost of settlement.(2) The Cabinet may decide that the difficulties of resettling them in theEmpire are insuperable, and that they must, therefore, be left wherethey are.The historical background of the present situation is as follows : Duringthe war of 1914-18 this Christian community from the mountains of EasternTurkey revolted, with Russian encouragement, against the Turkish Government,,were defeated, and fled into what is now Iraq. The post-war frontier settlement,reached as the result of a League of Nations decision and confirmed in the Treatyof Angora of 1926, placed their homeland on the Turkish side of the Turco-Iraqi frontier. The Assyrians were thereby left stranded in Iraq and the efforts made to settle them on the land in Northern Iraq were only partially successful.Political difficulties soon arose from the conflict between the desire of the assyrians on the one hand for homogeneous settlement and political autonomyand, on the other, the determination of the&apos; Iraqi Government to weld togetherall the different racial and religious elements of the country. This conflict endedwith the Assyrians&apos; attempted exodus to Syria, their fight with the Iraqi Armyand the &quot; massacre &quot; of 1933. The League of Nations thereafter tried for manyyears to find a home for the Assyrians outside Iraq. These efforts, extended to every part of the world, were unsuccessful, and all that was done was to settlesome 9,000 Assyrians, who had crossed into Syria in 1932-33, on the KhaburRiver in Northern S)rria. The remainder, numbering some 20,000, had to stay in Iraq.3. The events of the present, war have vastly increased our obligations towards these unfortunate people. The Assyrians had for many years previously been recruited by the R.A.F. for the Levy forces whose duty was to defend theBritish air fields in Iraq. When Rashid Ali revolted and sent the Iraqi army to attack our air base at Habbaniyah in May 1941, the Assyrian units of the levies stoutly defended it and afterwards took a notable part in the counter-offensive undertaken by our forces. Their loyalty to us had thus involved themin a second conflict with the Iraqi Army, and it is possible that after the war,when the British forces in Iraq have been reduced to peace-time strength, someIraqi elements may be disposed to seek a favourable opportunity for revenge.13461   [32200]
24. Since 1941 the British authorities in the Middle East have, in their efforts to deal with the shortage of man-power, greatly expanded the R.A.F.Levies and have, in fact, recruited almost every available Assyrian of military age in Iraq and Syria. The expanded R.A.F. Levies have served not only inIraq, but also in many other parts of the Middle East, including Syria and Cyprus,and have won high praise from their British officers.5. If the Cabinet decides that it is impossible to find room for the Assyriansin the British Empire, I consider that the least we can do is to inform themforthwith of their fate in order that they may endeavour to accommodate them-selves to the idea that their only future lies in Iraq, as citizens of the IraqiState. In this case I recommend that generous financial provision should bemade by His Majesty&apos;s Government towards any settlement schemes which mayhe necessary, to provide for the future of Assyrian members of the Levies.6.   I feel, however, that of the two alternatives above-mentioned, the first is preferable and I recommend to my colleagues that it be adopted for the- following reasons.7. From the point of view of making provision for the future of theseAssyrians who have served us so faithfully in this war and the last, the second course is obviously unsatisfactory. There is considerable justification for theopinion, which is widely held, that His Majesty&apos;s Government have incurred amoral obligation towards the Assyrians. Their loyalty to us has been in part the cause of the persecution they have suffered. Both in Iraq and Syria theyare a Christian minority in a State managed by Moslems. In Iraq in particularsome of the Moslem majority may well wish to avenge themselves on the Assyriansfor the part which they played in helping us to overcome Rashid Ali and the iraqi army in 1941. There is a real risk, if it were decided that the Assyriansshould remain in Iraq and Syria, that they would be exposed to dangers against which we should find it difficult, if not impossible, to afford them effective protection.8. It is earnestly hoped that a final decision may now be reached, and thatno attempt should be made to shelve the problem by suggesting further examina-tion of possible places outside the Colonial Empire where the Assyrians mightbe settled. All the possibilities have been exhaustively examined over the last ten years and there is no hope whatever that a re-examination of the possibilitiesof settlement in any particular territory will now produce any unexpectedlyfavourable result.9. I am constantly having to face the gibe that we are the largest Empir?in the world and yet we can never do anything anywhere to assist our friends,however pressing their claims may be.E.
