HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT),secret.      On 21st June the Overseas Reconstruction Committee considered a proposal for a temporary moratorium on exports of coal frmmthe British Zone.    It was agreed that if it was politicallypossible to secure a complete suspension of exports this was clearly the sound economic course.    If, however, we could not obtain general support for such a policy we should aim atmaintaining exports at the current rate of 900,000 tons a month and retaining in Germany any increase in production from the mines until such time as minimum domestic requirements were satisfied.    If production rose above this level an increasedpercentage would be allocated to export,2.      In the course of the Paris discussions the foreign secretary stated that if the Potsdam principle of treatingGermany as an economic unit was not accepted by the four powers the British Zone would be organised in such a way as to eliminate the burden which the British taxpayer is at present calledupon to bear,3.      In the light of this statement and in view of the fact thatit is only by retaining more coal in the zone that we canrecover the cost of imports, the British. Element of the control commission were proposing to take the line that in Septembera larger proportion of current production should be retained-for use in the British, American and French Zones and that exports should be reduced to about k50,000 tons per month,lp.      During the Paris discussion the Council of Foreign Ministersinstructed the Control Council to appoint a QuadripartiteCommittee of Experts to examine in all four zones the methodsof increasing coal production and make recommendations withregard to the principles governing the allocation of thisproduction- as between domestic consumption and export,    ThisExpert Committee is to report to Governments by 10th August andthe. Control Council has been instructed to submit the report tothe Council of Foreign Ministers before 1st September.    Itmight.therefore be held that no reduction in monthly exportallocations should be made until this report has been submitted.C.P.U6)  -51651BT JULY.  19U.6CABINETEXPORTS OF GOAL FROM THE british zone OF germany memorandum by the Chancellor of the duchy of LancasterxO.R .C.( US )91h 0one 1 conclusions , Minute 3

5.      On the other hand,  the longer we delay action tomaintain more coal in the British Zone the longer we shalldefer any substantial increase in coal output and theeasing of our financial burden.6,      The Quadripartite Fuel Committee in Berlin is at presentconsidering coal allocations for the month of September andour representative must be given instructions immediatelyas to the attitude he must take.    A decision is therefore necessary on whether we shall pursue our intention ofproposing&apos; a cut in allocations of about 5Qyb or whether we shall maintain exports at their current rate during that month and defer any reduction in exports until Octoberwhen the Expert Committee&apos;s    report will be available.7.      The Americans recognise the importance of retainingmore coal in Germany and as a result of the recent agreement to treat their zone and ours as a single economic unitwill be more concerned with the economic position of theBritish Zone.    I recommend therefore that we should try and obtain their support to the proposal set out inparagraph 3 above and only agree to maintain the exportallocation for September at the current monthly level if itis clear that this support will not be forthcoming.J.
