It is for consideration by the Cabinet at their meeting on Monday 14 July.Signed   JOHN hunt cabinet Office9 July 1975
ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES IN THE MEDIUM TERMNote by the treasury      This note discusses the allocation of national resources in the period towards the end of the present decade.     It isintended as a background to the discussion by the Cabinet of priorities in the public expenditure programme which is totake place on 25 July.     It does not purport to be a presents.-tion of economic strategy over the intervening period.     Thefigures are derived from a provisional version of the newmedium-term economic assessment (MTA).2      The two main problems for economic policy now are thehigh rate of inflation and the balance of payments deficit.Policies for resource allocation must be consistent withbringing inflation permanently under control and with solving the balance of payments problem,2      In preparing the assessment assumptions have had to bemade on a number of matters on which there is great uncertaintIn particular, it is assumed that we shall be able to find away through our unprecedented problems on the inflation frontwithout suffering grave disruption of economic progress.     Infact the chance that such disruption will occur is by nomeans negligible.     In past medium-term assessments it i\raspossible to assume that although there might be some tendencieto inflation these were not so powerful or so disruptive as to throw into doubt the assumption that normal economic progress would continue.     In present conditions such an assumption is1CONFIDENTIAL
COMPIDENTIAlino longer safe-     Persistent inflationary tendencies may force the Government to adopt policies of demand management which are definitely more restrictive than before;   both in this way and through its effects on business confidence the inflation maylower the level of investment and the underlying rate ofimprovement of productivity*     It is not a matter of the economy1 collapsing3 but of a possible period of low growth extending over the whole of the time with which we are concerned-     Thefigures presented below do not take account of this possibility,;they rather assume the continuance of established trends in the accumulation of productive capital and the growth of potentialoutput per head-     In present circumstances there is clearly acertain optimistic bias in this way of proceeding.The growth of &quot;production4      The main factor determining the size of available resources in the medium-term future will be the growth of total production(the Gross Domestic Product, GBP)-     A further factor which cansometimes be very important is the movement of the terms of tradethis is considered below under the heading of the balance ofpayments*5      Future GDP will in turn depend partly on the rate of growth of productive potential, ie, roughly the level of output at full employment;   and partly on the extent to which that potential isutilised, which may be broadly indicated by the rate ofunemployment.6      The labour force, which is one basic element in productive potential, is practically stationary in size;   the effectivefactor is therefore the underlying movement of output per head-
CORF IDENT1ALAlthough the recent short-term movement of output per head hasnot been favourable, the KTA assumes that over the medium termthere will be a rise on. the same trend as has been observedover a fairly long period in the past,.     This yields a rate of growth of productive potential over the MTA period of ^ustunder 3 per cent per&apos; annum.Cap^acity utilisation7      It is the task of the Government5 s management of purchasingpower to control the loading of demand on the nation&apos;s productivepotentials     At present the management of demand is severelyconstrained by the high rate of inflation and the large externaldeficits     A high and rising level of unemployment has.had to beaccepted fox* the time being.     It is en essential assumptionunderlying the MTA that in the medium term we shall find ways ofeliminating the balance of payments deficit and of reducing therate of inflation,,     Given this assumption it is reasonable to expect some easing of the present constraints on demand manage-ment and to postulate a higher level of use of the nation&apos;sproductive potential (ie, a lower level of unemployment) in thefuture period than we have now or can expect to have in thecoming months.     The Governments objective will be to restoreand then maintain full employment, but past experience stronglysuggests that it would be unwise to plan resources on the basis that in the medium term departures from full employment can be wholly avoided.     The appropriate txnemployment assumption forthe MTA is thus the level which we can be reasonably confidentof maintaining onf:average over a rim of years.     There can beno certainty in such a matter;   we have to make a reasonableselection from the rather wide sange of possible outcomes,which will be heavily influenced by vrorld forces and by thesuccess of the anti-inflation policies at home.     The MA hasassumed for the end of the period a level of unemploymentsimilar to what it has been on average over the last five years,,namely, 5 per cent*
8      On the basis of these assumptions, and subject therefore to the reservations in paragraph 3, the rate of growth of GDPfrom 1974-79 works out at a little over 3 per cent per aimuE,The average annual increment in the GDP comes to about 1,600 million? in 1970 prices.     It must be remembered thatin 1974-? because of the three-day week and the onset of the recession, the average level of activity was relatively low.If we measure from 197.2.* when activity was higher, the average rate of growth of GDP to 1979 would come to just over- 2% percent per annum.the ^balancem of m payments9      &apos;I&apos;he forward planning of resources must allow for a sufficiently early elimination of the deficit on the current balance of payments.     The 1975 deficit is likely to show abig improvement on 1974? hut there will still be a long wayto go.     Continuing heavy deficits would call for furtherexternal financing on top of the existing large indebtedness,while generating doubt about the credit-worthiness which is needed if the financing is to take place.     Thus we need astrong and sustained improvement in the current balance ofpayments position,,     Waiting for the full flow of North Seaoil to get us back into balance is not a viable alternative,if only because of the slow build-up of production now envisaged.     For these reasons the aim incorporated in theMTA is that balance on external account is reached in 1978(very much a minimum requirement).     Thereafter we shall need to earn surpluses over a period in order to repay our international debts.     The assessment assumes that over theperiod 1978-80 the surplus will average about 1 per cent of GDP. IJ
CONFIDENTIAL10     The world terms of trade between manufactures and primary products are assumed to become more favourable to manufacturesthan they were in -1974-, though less favourable than at thebeginning of the decade.   &apos; It is also assumed that the levelof world trade will recover fairly soon to its longer-termtrend line and will stay on it thereafter,,     Here again the assessment is discounting the possibility that present difficulties will seriously disrupt the long-term trends inthe world economy.1,1     The achievement of the balance of payments objective willabsorb a substantial proportion of the increment expected inour available resources *     V/e shall need a rise in net exports(exports minus imports) of goods and services, at 1970 prices,amounting on average to just over  -500 million per- annum between1974 and 1979-12     By the time we have returned to external balance in 1978the UK8a cumulative indebtedness, as measured by the aggregatecurrent account deficits since 1975* would be very large,perhaps of the order of  10 to  15 billion, at current prices,,The annual cost of servicing this debt would be of the orderof  11 to SAi billion.Investment ,13    Allowance must be made in the forward allocation of resources for an appropriate level of investmenta     Private sector invest-ment is currently rather low and declining:   but over a period ofyears conditions must be created which will encourage it to growif the productive capacity of the economy is not to sufferlong-term damage-     Indeed, in order to accelerate the rate of growth of productivity the Government are seeking to strengthen
the capital base of industry, ie, to foster industrial investment.     The assessment;-assumes a normal relationship,on the basis of past experience, between the growth of GDPand the level of investment.     This yields for fixed,industrial investment in.total a growth rate of, roughly,5 per cent per annum 1974-79, with private sector fixed investment at about 4^ per cent and investment bynationalised industries at about 6  per cent per annum.In terms of resources absorbed there would be a growth in total investment (including stocklmilding) of just over 500 million per annum, at 1970 prices, over the period,,Public.. e^enditu^ consumer14     Given the growth of GDP, on the one hand, and of theresources required to sustain investment and the balanceof payments,, on the other, we can calculate what will bethe increase of ffree resources8, ie, resources availablefor allocation between public expenditure and privately-financed consumption.     The figures given below show a comparison between 1974 and 1979.     T&apos;he choice of years for this comparison is not entirely straightforward.Between 1973 and 19S0, on )?resent expectations, the resourcepicture will be changing fast.     In 1978, on the assumptionthat the external deficit will have been finally eliminatedduring that year, the squeeze on resources will be very severe.     By 1980, on the ot?aer hand, for several reasons the position should be a good deal easier.     1979 shows an intermediate position.     Given this situation, and given that an. easy position in 1980 does nothing to enable the economy to accommodate relatively large public expenditure programmes in earlier years, it seems best to adopt 1979as the terminal year for the comparison.6GOEFIDMTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL15    There is unfortunately also some difficulty about the choice of initial year.     1974-, the latest complete year,is the obvious choice and the one we have adopted, but itis not a good base for judging medium-term trends in public and private expenditure.     Between 1975 and 1974- (asillustrated in the chart) there was a big shift fromprivately-finaneed consumption to public expenditure;    thelatter rose by about 7 per cent, while the former fell by5 per cent.     That 1974 was off trend is shown by a longer-term comparison:   the ratio of public expenditure to GDP rose from 4-5 per cent in 1963 to 51 per cent in 19751but in 197*&apos;!- it jumped suddenly to 58 per cent.16    The comparison between the resources picture of 1974and of 1979 is set out in the table, on the assumption thatthe up-dated White Paper public expenditure programmes areimplemented.     The key figures are the percentage growthrates for the total of free resources (1-J per cent), forthe total of public expenditure (just under 2 per cent),and for privately-financed consumption (between   and 1 percent).     The increase in privately-financed consumption isclearly very low, despite the depressed base from which westart;   between 1973 and 1979, arguably a better comparison,privately-financed consumption effectively stands still(see chart).     All in all the prospect to 1979 does not look properly balanced, though as already stated, beyond1979 the picture may be rather easier (this is also shownin the chart).17 The tax implications of the resource allocation set outin the table are harsh.     The MTA estimates are that a7
significant further increase in the tax burden, beyond thelevel set by the increases in the 1975 Budget, will be needed between 1975 and 1979*     The best way of illustratingthe problem is probably to concentrate on one single broad-based instrument, namely, the income tax rate, while holdingconstant in real terms all the other main elements in the tax system.     This means assuming that income tax allowances are up-dated in line with the rise in prices, and thatindirect tax rates are similarly up-rated where necessary.18    On this basis, the necessary rise in the rate of incometax by 1979 works out, very broadly, at 9-11 pence, ie, the basic rate might be 44-4-6 pence.     Higher rates would go upcorrespondingly (except that the top rate could presumablynot be pushed beyond 100 per cent), but there would be no prospect whatever of limiting the tax increases to those with higher incomes.     On the particular assumptions chosen,the average man, married with two children, would experiencea rise in his average income tax rate from about 15 per centin 1975 to, very roughly, 25 per cent in 1979-     His marginalrate of tax, allowing for graduated insurance contributions,would be of the order of 50 per cent.     There must be aserious risk that with such high marginal rates of taxationfor the average wage earner there would be significantadverse effects on incentives.19    In judging the economic significance of any particularprogramme of public expenditure it is necessary to bear inmind the prospect that throughout the period the Governmentwill be engaged in an effort to get the rate of inflationdown and keep it down..    It has generally been believed thatin the absence of an appreciable growth of privately-financedconsumption the pressure for wage and salary increases wouldbe extremely strong and would be a powerful force making forinflation.confidential
20    If the programme of public expenditure were reduced the resources picture would, of course, look a lot different.,A reduction of the order of  2 billion (at 1974- Survey prices)by 1978/79 would have the following effects.     First, therewould be a small effect in raising the rate of growth of productive potential (because of the smaller relative size of the public sector, where, by assumption, productivityis constant).     Secondly, there would be considerable changesin the rates of growth of public expenditure and of privately-financed consumption.     The first would come down to % per cent per annum (and from 1976/77 to 1978/79 it would in effectstand still), while the latter would go up to just under  per cent.     The tax implications would be eased;   the indications are that on the assumptions stated there wouldbe need for an increase in tax rates between 1975 and 1979 -ie, on top of those in the last Budget - perhaps of the orderof 2-4 pence.Interpretation of the figures21     There are several reasons why the simple comparison of1974- with the 1979 figures here presented gives an undulyfavourable view of the scale of future public expenditure programmes that could be accommodated without disruptiveeconomic effect.     First, there is the consideration setout in paragraph 15 that 1974 is a bad base year in which public expenditure formed an extraordinarily high proportion to national resources.     Secondly, there is the problem of north Sea oil.     The assessment assumes that there will beno further slippage of production relative to the Departmentof Energy&apos;s 1realistic&apos; forecast.     In fact there is astrong case for making some allowance in case North Sea oil production is delayed further.     A related point is thatthe oil price assumption made in the assessment now seems too low, at least in the short run.     Both these &apos;oil&apos; corrections9
would mean that with given public expenditure programmes therewould be less growth of privately-financed consumption and ahigher level of future taxation than the figures show.22     The third,, and most important, point is that already made in paragraph .3* namely, that there is a degree ofoptimism in the assumption that we shall be able to findour way through our present economic difficulties withoutsuffering any damage to the trend lines for productive potential and the degree of capacity utilisation on whichthe resources calculation depends.     The possibility of amuch less favourable outcome is not one which can bebrought in a neat quantitative way into the figures:   butit is none the less real.     It would be perfectly possibleto have a period of little real growth in the economyextending not just for a year or two, but over the wholeof the period with which we are here concerned, with veryadverse consequences for both public expenditure and privately-financed consumption.     The risks are not evenly balanced:if resources are committed to programmes in a way which takesno account of this risk, and it then comes off against us,the resulting damage will be far more serious than the ill-consequences which could follow from basing our plans on what proved in the event to be an under-estimate of what could be afforded.HM Treasury9 July 197510
