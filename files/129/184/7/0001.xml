PUBLIC EXPENDITURE PRIORITIESMemorandum by HM Treasury and the Central policy review StaffI. introduction. At their meeting on 22 May (CC(75)25 Conclusions) the Cabinetasked the Treasury and the CPRS to prepare a paper which would form a background for Ministerial discussion on public expenditurepriorities.2. In considering priorities, Ministers will be primarily concernedwith what they can achieve within the lifetime of the present Parlia-ment. This paper therefore concentrates on the possibilities up to1978-79. Ministers will need to ensure that the programmes forthe period up to 1978-79 in the next White Paper:(i) Are achievable in terms of the likely resources available;(ii) Reflect a coherent set of political priorities;(iii) Are sustainable in the longer term.Few programmes can be changed quickly: if the level and pattern of public expenditure in 1978-79 are to be considerably changed,decisions need to be made this year.3. It is not the purpose of this paper to guide Ministers to decisionsbefore the recess. Detailed information about individual pro-grammes and the consequences of making reductions in them willbe available in September when the Public Expenditure Survey is completed. The object of this paper is to provide a basis for ministers to look at recent developments in public expenditure programmes and to discuss their future priorities in strategic terms,as a preliminary to specific decisions in the Autumn.II. BACKGROUND(1) Total Public Expenditure4. Ministers will need to assess their future priorities against the background of the decisions which they have taken since theGovernment came into office in March 1974. This is illustrated by comparing the situation which they inherited, i.e.:-The December 1973 White Paper (Cmnd. 5519) as modified by cuts in the programme for 1974-75 announced at thesame time with the latest available statement of their policy decisions already taken, i.e.:
-The January 1975 White Paper (Cmnd. 5879) as modified bythe cuts announced in the April 1975 Budget, and other changes since the White Paper was published. (Note: these estimates (i) do not include those policies which have notyet been costed in expenditure programmes, e.g. the national enterprise Board, (ii) show the position before the start of the current PESC exercise.)5. Chart A makes this comparison (i) for total public expenditure,and (ii) for expenditure on goods and services and transfer payments.The chart, which follows page 13, shows:(a) That the net effect of decisions taken since March 1974 hasbeen to raise planned public expenditure substantiallyover the December 1973 programmes. (The previous government in announcing cuts for 1974-75 said thatthe programme in later years would also be reviewed,but they did not do so before leaving office);(b) And that within the larger total, there has been a majorswitch: the planned totals for goods and services havebeen reduced by comparison with the previous pro-gramme, but this reduction has been more than offset by increased transfer payments.6. The path of total expenditure shown in Chart A is very striking.It shows very rapid actual increases between 1972-73 and 1974-75,and much slower planned growth thereafter. Most of the increase between 1972-73 and 1974-75 was due to higher spending on housing, social security, compensation to nationalised industries for price restraint and food subsidies. In fact, between 1972-73 and1974-75 total public expenditure went up by about 20% in costterms at 1974-75 prices. On&apos;the conventional definition, GDProse by 5% over these two years but if account is taken of theworsening of the terms of trade (e.g. the oil price rise), GDP fellby over 1% while Public Expenditure rose 20%. The public expenditure explosions of 1973-74 and 1974-75 have been so large as at best very severely to restrict the scope for future increases.(2) Changes Within the Total of Public expenditure.  The decisions which Ministers took in 1974 were reflected in theprogramme set out in the January 1975 White Paper which gave:High priority(i) To social programmes related to the social contract:immediate uprating of pensions and future uprating of long-term benefits in line with earnings; increases in public sector housebuilding and in housing subsidies;food subsidies to restrain inflation;
(ii) To industrial efficiency: productive investment in national-ised industries; regional, industrial and agricultural support; manpower and training; North Sea oil relatedinfrastructure;Lower priority for other programmes. s8. The effects of these decisions on the relative size of the main programmes in 1977-78, as compared with the previous Govern-menfs plans are shown in Chart B. This shows a larger share ofexpenditure going to social security, housing, trade and industry and food subsidies, and a lower share to all the other main programmes.A lower share does not of course imply that a programme is actuallyfalling.9. Chart C shows the size of the changes: housing and social security show the largest increases, defence and education the largestabsolute reductions below previous programmes.10. Chart D compares the latest out-turn for 1974-75 with present plans for 1978-79. It shows increases in most programmes withsocial security, social services and education all taking largerproportionate shares of total expenditure in 1978-79 and lower food subsidies. [Note: the Trade and Industry totals appear to fallbecause only sums already committed for specific projects of selective assistance to industry are included; it is unrealistic to expect that a reduction on this scale will actually occur.)III.   THE PROBLEM11. The Medium Term Assessment (C(75)78) has shown that from now on the constraints on total public expenditure will be tight inthe extreme. Ministers will therefore need to re-examine public expenditure programmes stringently in the light both of the need to bring about a substantial and continuing reduction of the borrowing requirement (and the related taxation prospects) and oftheir political priorities.12. The tightness of the position highlights the importance of (i)assessing priorities and (ii) getting value for money from existing programmes. In re-assessing priorities, simple proportional cutsapplied to all programmes across the board will not give the rightanswer, because X% off one programme will frequently have very different implications from X% off another. There may be items of such importance that they merit increased allocations even though in present circumstances that implies deeper cuts elsewhere.
Ministers will need to consider how they can increase their room tomanoeuvre within a very tight total not just by changes at the marginbut also by major and radical changes in policies in particular areas.13. The present discussion of priorities has two inter-actingelements: Identifying any areas of such high priority that the pro-grammes should not be reduced; Identifying the lower priority areas: this will require a systematic examination of individual programmes, to see what policy changes would be required to achieve significantreductions.14. High priority areas can only be defined in the light of theresources available. Open-ended commitments to particularprogrammes, without well-defined and enforceable ceilings, will bothmake effective control of expenditure impossible, and also frustrate the achievement of a coherent set of priorities. Moreover, the factthat some objective has high priority within the total does not mean that it needs to be growing fast in absolute terms. Proper expendi-ture control and value for money are as important principles forhigh priority as for lower priority areas.Determining Priorities15. To assess priorities, Ministers need criteria and one possibleset of criteria are the objectives set out in the 1974 Manifestos (see annex I). But:(i) Much of the thinking behind the Manifestos took place before the dramatic rise in oil prices, before the balanceof payments deficit had become so serious and before theproblem of cost inflation had become so dangerous;(ii) The Manifestos do not give much indication of prioritiesas between different objectives.16. In broad terms, the Governments objectives can be summarisedas: &quot; stopping inflation getting the balance of payments right-promoting economic growth making progress towards a more equal society- helping the disadvantaged.17. It is possible to ask how far individual expenditure programmescontribute to each of these objectives, and to assign priorities accord-ingly. Such an approach can be helpful: for example, expenditure programmes with a high resource cost in balance of payments termsneed particularly serious scrutiny; productive investment which
increases export potential or saves imports cost-effectively maydeserve higher priority. But, equally, there are usually conflictsbetween these objectives: food subsidies and subsidies on nationalised industries prices help counter-inflation in the short-run, but distortresource allocation and are bad for economic growth and the balanceof payments in the medium term. Again, measures which promoteequality and help the disadvantaged can raise the tax burden, reducethe net take home pay of the ordinary wage-earner, and so can add to the pressures for inflationary wage increases.18. A general statement of objectives of this kind can therefore dono more than provide a few pointers. Priority between the objectivesdepends on the current position. In present circumstances, thehighest priority has to be assigned to stopping inflation and getting the balance of payments right. In determining their priorities,Ministers will need to consider how to do this with minimum damage to their other objectives of promoting economic growth, a more equalsociety and helping the disadvantaged.19. In sum, Ministers can only determine priorities by a case by caseexamination of individual programmes. The Public expenditure survey will provide a detailed basis for decisions on options inSeptember. But there are a number of strategic questions which ministers should consider now, because their reactions to thesequestions could:(i) Affect their collective approach to the detailed decisions whichthey will be obliged to take in the Autumn;(ii) Identify options which they would like to see explored, but which the present Public Expenditure Survey may notthrow up.IV.  THE PROGRAMMES20. Chart E sets out an analysis of the individual public expenditure programmes for 1978-79.21. The programmes shown in Chart E can be classified broadly asfollows:Goods and Services(a) The structure of society: defence and overseas services, lawand order, administration of government;(b) Economic and social infrastructure: employment services,nationalised industries investment, roads and transport,other environmental services including water and sewerage, research;(c) Provisions which benefit individuals directly:  housing,education, health and personal social services.
Transfer Payments(d) Industrial, regional and agricultural support;(e) Food subsidies, housing subsidies, subsidies on energy andtransport;&apos; &apos; &quot; is(/) Retirement pensions, supplementary benefits, student grants.22. In considering their priorities Ministers will need to consider the levels of expenditure on goods and services and on transfer payments.23. Government expenditure on goods and services represents adirect claim on resources, and hence a direct burden on the taxpayer.Directly or indirectly, they have a very large manpower content.Since public sector pay rises, on average, at about the same rate as private sector pay the costs of goods and services programmes tends to rise faster than costs generally. The cumulative effect of this&quot;relative price effect &quot; on resource allocation generally is in itself an argument for looking at the growth of goods and services programmesvery carefully.24. The difficulties which this &quot; relative price effect&quot; pose for public expenditure planning and control, and for the tax burden, are wellillustrated by the estimates set out in Annex II. These show that between 1970-71 and 1974-75 :(i) In terms of real resource costs, the goods and servicesprogrammes increased by nearly 25 % ;(ii) About half this increase represented an increase in thevolume of goods and services provided: the other halfreflected the increase in the relative cost of providingthem; ii //(iii) Of the half attributable to relative prices, something likeone-third was attributable to the long-term trend in therelative movement of pay and prices; most of the restwas the result of the unprecedented rise in the relative price of construction in the past two or three years.25. Reappraisal of goods and services programmes must thereforebe a major element in a review of priorities. But equal attention will need to be given to transfer payments.Transfer Payments        //m -It26.s There are broadly three kinds of transfer payments: (i)assistance to industry (ii) social security and related benefits, and(iii) subsidies. As Chart A, and paragraph 5 above show, the largestincreases in public expenditure have been in transfer payments.Ministers have already agreed to eliminate subsidies to nationalised
industry prices and to phase out food subsidies over a period ofyears. They will need to review their priorities for other transfer payments including how far these transfers can be directed to helping the neediest by being more selective.V.  THE QUESTIONSHigh Priority Areas27. What areas are of such importance that they deserve to have their present programmes maintained (or even increased) despite the inevitable effect on other programmes?Lower Priority Areas28. Ministers may find the most fruitful approach to identifyinglower priority areas is to look at the individual programmes in thelight of the following questions:(i) Was a rising standard planned when the prospect lookedbetter than it does now? If so, should the improvementbe slowed down, or postponed altogether?(ii) Can a falling standard be tolerated?(iii) Can programmes which benefit the individual be made more selective?(iv) Could more be privately financed or government supportreduced?(v) Are there any items which could be substantially reduced or cut out altogether? )&apos;)29.  Taking these questions in turn:(i) Slowing down or halting improvements?This question is particularly relevant for:(a) Nationalised industries investment:Proposals will be submitted for separate consideration by ministers before the Summer Recess. Chart E shows that large programmes are envisaged for fuel, steel and the PostOffice. Investment which cannot be justified by its contribu-tion to the growth of the nation&apos;s productive capacity and exports, or by the commercial prospects of the industry should be critically questioned. Is the present test discountrate (10%) sufficiently rigorous?(b) Roads and transport, other environmental services, includ-ing water and sewerage:See Chart D;
(c) Education, health and personal social services:See Chart D;id) Retirement pensions, supplementary benefits:The objectives of the Manifesto were that pensioners, inparticular, should (i) get a once for all improvement (ii)subsequently be assured of a fair share in rising prosperitygenerally. The first of these objectives has been achieved:with the tax burden and low growth of take home paynow in prospect, Ministers need to consider whether pen-sions should continue to be linked to pre-tax earnings ratherthan prices or take-home pay.(ii) Can a falling standard be tolerated?This question is particularly relevant for:(a) Defence:Unlike most other programmes, defence has already beenthe subject of a major review: the resulting changes in policy will bring defence spending more into line with thatof our major Continental allies: it will reduce commitments,but preserve the essentials of our contribution to NATO.Ministers need to consider whether further significantreductions can be made, taking into account the likelyinternational situation on the one hand and our economic position on the other. u(b) Overseas services :Is the scale of activities commensurate with our reducedrole?(c) Posts and telecommunications, roads and transport, otherenvironmental services including water and sewerage.(d) Housing and aspects of health and personal social servicesand education.(e) Law and order, administration of government:Can standards of service and manning be reduced?(iii) Can programmes which benefit the individual be more selective?This question is particularly relevant for:(a) Food subsidies, nationalised industries subsidies :Ministers have agreed not to subsidise nationalised industryprices generally, arid to phase out food subsidies over aperiod. Where nationalised industry deficits cannot be eliminated, they will need if at all possible to be substantially reduced and at the minimum contained. Since generalsubsidies of this kind benefit everyone, they are a very cost-ineffective method of helping the needy.
(b) Housing subsidies:In total the cost to the public purse of support for housingis expected to be nearly  4% billion in 1978-79 (see Chart D).More than a quarter of this will be subsidies to councilhouse tenants. The figure does not include the cost of tax relief to owner occupiers which currently costs almost asmuch as rent subsidies; the two together come to about\% of GNP. The Department of the EnvironmentsHousing Finance Review is now reviewing the whole of this area of policy, but the results will not be available in timefor decisions on this year&apos;s Public Expenditure White Paper.(c) Social security benefits.(iv) Could more be privately financed or Government supportreduced ?This question is particularly relevant for:(a) Assistance to industry:This is an area where there are risks of large and open-endedcommitments. It will be necessary to ensure (i) that con-sistent and rigorous criteria are applied in every case,(ii) that the amounts provided case by case are kept within limits which are in tune with the other constraints on public expenditure.(b) All services subject to charges: \\Wherever the Government already charges for services,there is, as a minimum, a case for uprating charges fully in line with inflation.(c) Education, health and perhaps roads:For these programmes an alternative, or partial alternative,to reducing provision may be to increase or impose charges.Increases in existing charges can be implemented quitequickly and should not put up the administrative costs of collection. New charges are only worthwhile if administra-tive costs are low in relation to potential revenue.(v) Are there any items which could be substantially reduced or cutout altogether ?Ministers might ask that new programmes which require a lot of manpower should be looked at particularly carefully.Particular Problems30.  There are two special problems to be considered.31. About 40% of expenditure on goods and services is spent by thelocal authorities. Ministers have already recognised the urgent heedto find new means of controlling local authority expenditure. This
may mean taking statutory powers to reduce local authorities&apos;autonomy. Many of the capital programmes of the local authoritiesinvolve new or better provision rather than replacement and willrequire more people to staff and maintain them when completed. Asa result it may well be impossible for them to keep their future current expenditure down unless their capital programmes are significantly reduced.32. One of the highest priorities should be given to establishing a genuine contingency reserve of adequate size. Decisions takenbetween one year&apos;s White Paper and the next year&apos;s Survey can veryeasily eliminate the contingency reserve altogether, or mortgage it forthe whole five-year period. The small size of the contingency reserve, and the way it gets eaten into by ad hoc decisions is one of the major causes of Ministers&apos; lack of room to manoeuvre on public expenditure.VI.  POINTS FOR DISCUSSION33.  The following questions are suggested as a focus for discussion :(i) What should be regarded as high priority areas deserving tohave their present programmes maintained or evenincreased ? &quot;   ,,. &quot;(ii) How far can planned improvements in the social and environmental services be slowed down or halted ?Where these are local authorities&apos; services, how can this be done ?(iii) Under present constraints, how far should across-the-boardimprovements of social security benefits give place toconcentration of benefit on need? Could services and benefits generally be made more selective ?(iv) Is there more that could be charged for in full or in part ?Should existing charges be raised ?(v) How can the largely opened-ended commitments to assistance to industry and to housing be contained ?(vi) Are there activities which might be cut from the programmesaltogether, or greatly reduced ?34. Both Ministers collectively and Departmental Ministers will need to consider how wide-ranging a review they are prepared toundertake. Since there is so little/ room to manoeuvre, and sincedecisions taken this year will largely determine the pattern ofexpenditure for the rest of this Parliament, there are strong arguments for being as radical and wide-ranging as possible. Are there anypossibilities which have hitherto been regarded as unthinkable which ministers now wish examined?
Annex ITHE 1974 LABOUR PARTY MANIFESTOSThe following is a list of the major specific proposals and objectives in the February and October 1974 Manifestos which have public expenditure implications; they are divided according to a rough,and necessarily arbitrary classification. Both Manifestos made clearthat the timing of achieving these objectives would depend cruciallyon progress in getting on top of economic problems.Defence and Overseas1. Reduce defence spending2. Renegotiation of Common Market terms3. International co-operation on resources4. 0 - 7 % of GNP for overseas aidPublic Ownership and industry. Industry Act. Planning agreements. National Enterprise Board6. Public ownership of and participation in exploitation of north sea and Celtic energy7. Community ownership of development land8.

Give clear priority to the mentally ill16. Expand education by programme of nursery schools and morefacilities for 16-18 year olds. End Direct Grant schools.Withdraw tax relief from public schools. Press on withcomprehensive education17.  Better services, more manpower, in inner urban areas.
Income Distribution18.  Immediate increases in pensions and other benefits. Increasesthereafter in line with earnings.19. Child cash allowances.20. Help for the disabled.21. Wealth tax.   Capital Transfer Tax.22. Price control.   Food subsidies.23. Equal pay for women.Other24.  Devolution.The February 1974 Manifesto concluded with the following listof the &quot; priorities we have chosen &quot;:(a) Bring about a fundamental and irreversible shift in thebalance of power and wealth in favour of working people and their families;(b) Eliminate poverty wherever it exists in Britain, and commit ourselves to a substantial increase in our contribution tofight poverty abroad;(c) Make power in industry genuinely accountable to theworkers and the community at large;(d) Achieve far greater economic equality-in income wealthand riving standards;(e) Increase social equality by giving far greater importanceto full employment, housing, education and socialbenefits;(/) Improve the environment in which our people live and work and spend their leisure.

Notes on Chart A1.  Charts A, B and C compare (a) The public expenditure programmes in the January 1975 White Paper(Cmnd. 5879), updated to take account of changes recorded to 22 May1975, including the reductions for 1976-77 announced in the Budget.(The figures have not been adjusted to reflect the ground-rules adopted for the public expenditure Survey.)(b) The public expenditure programmes in the December 1973 White Paper(Cmnd. 5519), modified by the reductions for 1974-75 announced on thedate of publication. In announcing these reductions, the previous government said that the programmes for the later years would be reviewed;but they had not carried out that review before they left office. Thedifference between the two White Papers also reflects some changes inthe information on which the estimates were constructed.2. The figures for transfer payments included in Cmnd. 5519 and Cmnd. 5879are not directly comparable. In Cmnd. 5879, the figures included an allowance for the real improvement attributable to the Governments uprating policy for social security benefits. In Cmnd. 5519 and previous White Papers, the forecasts for social security were based on the latest known rates of benefit at the time theWhite Paper was published, and any subsequent real improvement in benefit rateswas left as a charge on the contingency reserve. It is not possible to quantify how much difference this would make to the Cmnd. 5519 figures shown in the Chart,but the total contingency reserve included in Cmnd. 5519, for both this and other purposes, rose from about  200 million (at 1975 Survey prices) in 1974-75 to about 1 billion in 1977-78.3. Debt interest, the contingency reserve, and the general deduction for short-fall, have all been excluded from the Chart.Public expenditure 1972/73 -1978/79 000 million at 1975 survey pricesCHARTA48January 1975 White Paper CMND 5879 updated to 22 May 1975,including budget cuts for 1976/77December 1973 White Paper CMND 5519 modified by December 1973 cutsTotal481972/73 73/7474/7575/7676/7777/7878/79

Taking intoaccount the reassessment of the cost of the previously planned programme, thedifference in the provision for defence amounts (at 1975 Survey prices) to about 440 million in 1977-78, instead of about  230 million; both figures are illustratedon the Chart.3.   Nationalised industries the comparison of expenditure on nationalised industries capital investment is affected by the decision to include in Cmnd. 5879 a considerably larger forecast of shortfall from the planned programmes. This accounts for  200 million of thedifference. The remainder of the difference is more than accounted for by a revisionof the electricity investment programme in the light of reduced forecasts of demand.4.
