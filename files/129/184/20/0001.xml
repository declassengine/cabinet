DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT1C(75) 95 COPY NO     w A18 September 1975CABINETUNEMPLOYMENT measures memorandum by the Secretary of State for employment, Unemployment is still rising strongly.    The seasonally adjustedfigure at the September count had risen by 30,000 since August and inaddition there were still 118,000 school-leavers on the register - a quiteunprecedented number.    We know the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and our supporters in Parliament and in the country are gravely perturbed by thesefigures.    Public opinion generally will rightly revolt against the idea of rising unemployment;  and we will come under great pressure to reflate the economy.    I think it essential for us to show that we fully share thedeepending concern about unemployment, and that we are taking significantsteps to slow down the increase, to mitigate the effects of unemployment for those already unemployed and to reduce unemployment among young persons.This can be done at a fraction of the cost of a full reflation and it would be aprice well worth paying to maintain our general strategy.    But the amountsinvolved must not seem trivial.2.        In my own field I make the following proposals:a. Work CreationThe Manpower Services Commission are ready to introduce their work creation scheme under which 15,000 jobs would be producedfor unemployed persons at a cost of  30 million.    The TUC are verykeen on this scheme,    I would propose that it should be orientatedtowards helping young persons, though it would not be restricted tothem.    The objection to work creation is that it may mean spendingmoney on projects which are less worth while in themselves than other activities especially in the local authority field on which expenditure is being cut.    The answer to this is that work creationprojects can be introduced very quickly indeed and are highly labourintensive.    Moreover, the scheme can be quickly wound up when nolonger needed and does not lead to continuing expenditure.1
b. TrainingWe have already provided an extra  50 million to the TrainingServices Agency (TSA) at the time of the Budget, followed by 8.5 million in July, and this will enable an additional 37, 500persons to be trained.    The TSA have told me that they could expandexisting schemes and introduce new schemes, mainly for the trainingof young persons in apprenticeships or otherwise, at a cost of 20 million.    They have also proposed that training allowances should be uprated when unemployment benefit is increased inNovember so that the allowances maintain their percentage lead overbenefit.    That would cost  2-1 million.    Finally they have drawn myattention to the thin lead (75p) which the training allowance for young persons has over the corresponding rate of benefit.    Theywould like to increase this lead to something like the lead enjoyed byadults at a cost of  1^ million and thus provide an added incentive for young people to take training courses,    I strongly support all theseproposals, costing some  24 million in all spread over the years1975-76 and 1976-77.c. Recruitment SubsidyWe have already agreed to introduce a recruitment subsidy for youngpersons payable to employers who recruit this 8ummer&apos;s school-leavers.    My original proposal was that the scheme should beintroduced from 1 November at a cost of  3-^ million.    I now proposethat it should be introduced from 20 October at a cost of  5 million.I would like the subsidy to be available to public employers as wellas to others so as to hasten the absorption of the school-leavers intoemployment.    I understand the Treasury have seen some difficulty about doing this, but I hope the difficulty can be overcome.Extensive publicity will be needed for the success of this scheme andI would like to spend a little money on that.d. Temporary Employment SubsidyThis scheme, which operates in the assisted area, applied toredundancies of 50 or more.    We judged that the subsidy would beapplied for in perhaps 25 per cent of eligible cases.    During thefirst four weeks&apos; operation of the scheme applications have come in inrespect of 33 per cent of eligible redundancies.    If, over a year, the25 per cent estimate proves valid, 32, 000 jobs will have beenpreserved at a cost of S,8j million.   I would propose to extend thisscheme to the whole country, increasing the number of jobspreserved to 60, 000 at an additional cost of  7f million.    The main difficulty in doing this is that the European Commission may raise objection to the subsidy being paid outside the assisted areas.However, the subsidy is an extremely economical way of creatingwork and I think we should be prepared to argue our case with theCommission.
e.        Labour MobilityFrom 1 November we are doubling expenditure on the EmploymentTransfer Scheme under which unemployed workers are givenfinancial assistance to move to other parts of the country for work.The  4 million involved was provided by the Chancellor of theExchequer in his Budget.    We could improve this scheme stillfurther at the cost of a further  3 million.    At present 14, 000workers a year are helped to move and we estimate that the 4 million additional expenditure already approved plus the 3 million I am now proposing would increase this number to around22, 000.    It would be a great help in this area if local authorities could be persuaded to make more houses available for transferredworkers.3.        The proposals I have just made would cost  70 million in all.    Thatis useful in so far as it goes but it is, in my view, a quite inadequateresponse to the current unemployment situation and will not avert the dangers to which I drew attention at the beginning of this paper.    I believe itis necessary to make some selective increases in public expenditure.    Theyshould be such as to create a maximum number of jobs and they should be capable of being introduced quickly and also wound up quickly when the need is past.    I do not think that measures to improve industrial efficiency,highly desirable though they are in the longer term, fall into this category.Other Ministers will be better able than I am to suggest suitable areas for expenditure.    The Secretary of State for the Environment has told me thathe could spend in 1975-76 and 1976-77 an additional  33 million on localauthority house improvements,  23 million on private sector houseimprovements and  45 million on new house building and renovation throughhousing associations.    This expenditure would provide some 14,000 jobs on work of obvious utility and is the kind of selective expenditure I would thinkto be necessary.4. There are other possible ways of relieving unemployment such asencouraging both organisations and individuals to buy British.    It seemsparticularly desirable that public authorities should be urged to do this.    Iwould also support an exhortation from the Government to young people to stay on at school or to go into further education from school.    Coupled withthis might be an appeal to employers to allow more young people day releasefor educational purposes.5.        Finally, it would be desirable for us to have contingency plansprepared for taking further action to deal with unemployment should thesituation worsen considerably during the winter.    In my own field it wouldbe possible to contemplate increased expenditure on the work creationscheme which would be feasible once the scheme presently proposed hasbeen introduced and got into its stride.    I think such further studies should3
also examine the possibility of increasing public expenditure in fields with high degree of utilisation of labour, while reducing it by a commensurateamount in fields where labour utilisation is low.M department of Employment18 September 19754
