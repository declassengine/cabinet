RACE RELATION AND HOUSINGOBSERVATIONS ON THE REPORT ON HOUSING OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON&apos;RACE RELATIONS AND IMMIGRATION &apos;introduction.      The Select Committee on Race Relations and Immigration devoted their1970/71 session to housing.   Their Report was presented to Parliament inJuly 1971*   The publication of the Report, and its supporting material,added substantially to the information available on, to quote the SelectCommittee, &quot;a major topic affecting both immigrants * and the host populat-ion&quot;.20       Since it was published, the Report has been widely studied and hashad a substantial influence on the way housing and associated policies have developed.   The Government welcomes this- opportunity of formally acknowled-ging the work of the Select Committee and the contribution which its report has made,3.      The Report raised many matters affecting Government Departments andlocal authorities, other bodies who provide or finance housing or who areconcerned with housing matters, and organisations working in the field of community relations and representative of immigrants.   Consultations and consideration of the issues raised by one of the most sensitive of the subjects which the Select Committee has been studying, and in particular of the question of records, proved to be protracted.   But it is now hyears since, under a previous administration, consultations on the Reportstarted.   The Report has been taken into account in the formulation ofGovernment policies and over half of the hG specific recommendations inthe Report have in practice been acted on by central Government.   A formalreply to the Report is, however, overdue; and a separate memorandum on thetime taken to publish it has been put to the Select Committee by theThe Government recognises that the term &quot;immigrants&quot; no longer satis-factorily identifies coloured people in this country; most of them have been permanently settled here for many years or have been bornhere0   The Government also recognises the wide variety in culture ,background and attitude which is to be found in different coloured orethnic groups: they cannot be regarded as a single or homogeneouscommunity.   References to immigrants, coloured people, and ethnicminorities in this reply should be understood accordingly.
1.Department of the Environment.   In the context of this delay, the Governmentwill consider carefully the recommendation in the Select Committee&apos;s recently published report&quot; that the staff devoted to race relations in the Departmentof the Environment, as elsewhere, should be strengthened. .that immigrants and migrants tend to settle at least initially in inner city and other older urban areas which already suffer housing, economic, environ-mental and social stresses.   Like most immigrants before them, many colouredimmigrants to this country over the past 20 years have lacked at first themoney or qualifications for well paid jobs which would allow them to affordany except the cheapest accommodation.   Later immigrants, accustomed to asociety with different values and social habits, and often unable to speakEnglish, have sought out others with a similar background to themselves, andin this way found a sense of security and identity.   Immigrants and migrantstend to be proportionately younger than the population generally andtherefore with proportionately more people of child-bearing age.   Thuscontinuing influx of people to the same areas, often in the inner cities, inaddition to the birth of children to those already there, have put a severe strain on already scarce accommodation, accelerating its deterioration.   the pressure has also given opportunity to unscrupulous landlords in bothimmigrant and host communities to exploit those in areas of housing shortageby charging high rents for poor accommodation.   There has been a proportion-ately bigger cultural and economic motivation towards home ownership amongrecent immigrant communities than among other poor families generally.   But someimmigrants, in seeking to become owner-occupiers, have been faced with excessiveinterest charges because they had difficulties in raising finance from conventionalsources: meeting these charges has, in some cases, meant the creation of unsatisfactory tenancies and overcrowding.5.      The Government&apos;s view is that it is essential for the development ofhealthy social conditions, particularly in the old urban areas, that thereshould not be ethnic, racial, religious or class discrimination in the formulation or the application of housing policies and practices.   people in housing need should have, and feel that they have, a better opportunitythan they have had so far of access to decent housing, whether public or private; and of sharing in the improvement of housing conditions.   It isthe Government*s policy to secure this.*   &quot;The Organisation of Race Relations Administration&quot;, July 1975RAGE RELATIONS AND HOUSING POLICYIt has been the common experience both here and in other countries
6.      The Government agrees with the view of the Select Committee that &quot;thehousing of immigrants cannot be separated from housing the community at large&quot;.   Housing is pre-eminently a service in which the main contribution towards helping coloured people in need is made through general programmes and policies, and because of people*s need rather than of their colour.7.      As part of the community, coloured people in need will benefit, forexample from the increased expenditure on housing since this government took office and the current increase in public sector house building; fromthe provisions in the Housing Act 197^ for stimulating the housing association movement and giving substantial assistance to hostels; and fromthe recasting of the subsidy system in the Housing Rents and Subsidies Act1975.80      In particular, they stand to benefit from the increasing emphasis,under the Housing Act 197^, on rehabilitating old areas of housing insteadof allowing their continued decline into slumdom which can then be tackledonly by wholesale clearance and development.   The Housing Act 1969 and thenew provisions in the Housing Act 197^ provide for the declaration of general improvement Areas, Priority Neighbourhoods and Housing Action Areas0   TheGovernment intend that this approach should become central to housing policyand practice in tackling stress areas, where disproportionately large numbersof coloured and other disadvantaged people - including one parent families,elderly, disabled and poor single people - live, many in furnished propertyhitherto without security and so more likely to become homeless.   TheGovernment has, in the Rent Act 197^, extended security of tenure fortenants of furnished accommodation.   It has enabled local authorities and housing associations to start on a programme of social acquisition, concen-trating on bringing into social ownership and improving properties in stressareas: and is considering further ways of establishing social ownership andcontrol.   These policies spring from the conviction that it is primarilythrough such action that the bad housing, poor use of housing stock, thedecline in the private rented sector and the difficult social conditionsin stress areas, can be dealt with most effectively.9*      The Government expected that most Housing Action Areas in the conurbations would, by their nature, be likely to include ethnic minorities.Their presence is one of the items which local authorities have been askedto see is covered in the reports on Housing Action Areas, and the attention
of authorities has been drawn to the importance of developing channels of communications with those not accustomed to speaking or reading English.There is a statutory opportunity for suitably qualified people or groups,as well as local authorities, to prepare or contribute to the report onthe physical state of property and the social conditions in stress areasbefore their formal declaration as Housing Action Areas; and localauthorities have been reminded of the importance of involving those living in stress areas, or representing their interests, in the action programmesdesigned to improve living conditions for the benefit of the people livingthere.   Experience so far amply bears out the expectations that the housing action Area Programme would be relevant to the special needs of, among others, ethnic minorities: Housing Action Areas declared or notified tothe Department of the Environment include a number in which ethnic minoritygroups are referred to; and such areas are being declared in many parts ofthe countryQ   A watch, however needs to be kept to see that ethnic groupslike other disadvantaged groups, do in practice benefit from improvements in housing conditions in Action Areas: local authorities have accordingly been asked to distinguish, in their annual progress reports, the character-istics of the households moving into and out of these areas.i10.     Bad housing and the difficulties which newcomers, whatever theirorigin, can find in getting accommodation in the public or private sectorin urban areas are among the factors which make up the complex of problems which people who are living or want to live there can face.   A range ofinitiatives have been taken by Government to promote a more comprehensive and community approach in areas of deprivation, and to see that, withincurrent financial restraints, they can be tackled with a greater sense of urgency.   The Department of the Environment&apos;s studies of inner city areas,and support for neighbourhood management schemes, are designed to bring out better ways of tackling the housing and related social problems in areas of stress.B0&amp; Circular 13/75 has pointed to the need forauthorities to consider, in the context of the area approach, how theycan extend their operations beyond the improvement and control of thehousing situation towards the achievement of wider social objectives./&quot;Also, the recently published report of the Central Policies Review StaffiA Joint Framework for Social Policies, indicated some v/ays in which centralirir^cMTS At. *
Government will be trying to improve the co-ordination and effectiveness of social policies^2711.     The Government has made it clear that it looks to local authoritiesto take the broadest view of their statutory responsibilities and powers,taking into account private as well as public housing; to respond to thehousing needs of their area by formulating and pursuing social policies for new building and older housing, and for managing and allocating theirown housing stock; and to be ready to give advice (directly or throughvoluntary housing aid centres) on housing matters to those in need or inignorance of the help available to them,,   While immigrants and their families living in inner urban areas share the disadvantages of those areas with the very many others living there, they may have added difficulties of racial discrimination, of gaining access to information, of understandinghousing lav/, procedures and practice: landlords as well as tenants may find themselves in difficulties, or faced with formal proceedings, as a resultBThese special circumstances need to be taken into accounts   It will be particularly important fcc ensure that coloured people are informed about the neforiss of tenure and social frm&amp;zship being  dd*el-:.ped by Gc/^rnment and localgovernment - co-operative and co-ownership scheiSes with tenant manageress, andsc/heties involving&quot; sharing the equity and&apos; deferred phtf chase.12.The Government believes that the effect of its housing measures, andof the housing policies of local government, as outlined above, whilstdesigned to benefit the community as a whole, will give increasing priority- in terms of more specific action and greater resources - to the areas ofgreatest housing need; and that these measures and policies enable account to be taken of the particular needs of ethnic groups as well as of thoseneeds and problems which they share with others.   This necessarily brief account of a serious and complex part of the social scene seeks to strike a fair balance.   But it shows that the Government recognises that some special efforts are needed in the housing field to promote equity and improve race relations.   The Government also proposes to follow up the SexDiscrimination Bill now before Parliament by legislation for strengthening the race relations machinery and, in particular, to deal with discrimination.13.     Against this background, the Government&apos;s observations on the individual -dual recommendations in the report are given in the Annex.   These observat-ions take account of the many steps which have in fact been taken, since1971, on the points raised in the report.   But two series of recommendations,relating to matters on which the Report considers special action should be
taken in relation to coloured people, are of such critical importance thatthey need to be dealt with in this main part of the Government&apos;s reply.These concern the keeping of records, and dispersal.KEEPING RECORDS1*f.     The Report&apos;s first recommendation was that the Government should holddiscussions specifically on keeping records of coloured people in relationto housing, with a view to formulating an acceptable, fully comprehensive,workable system, with proper safeguards for confidentiality.15.     The discussions which the Department of the Environment have had withthe local authority associations and immigrant organisations have confirmed that, as the Select Committee&apos;s own researches indicated, the idea of keep-ing records by reference to colour continues to provoke a wide variety ofstrongly felt opinions. However, the Race Relations Beard and the CommunityRelationsCommission believe, with the Select.Committees- that record-keeping of this natureis needed: and their vims follow on the report of th% GuIIixtgworth committee*andhave beon added to by subsequent research.16.   The Government agrees that sensible and confidential record-keeping about thehousing of coloured people should be encouraged in appropriate areas.   But some ofthe arguments put forward in supporfcof keeping records have tended to stoh short of saying to what beneficial use the records would in practice be putj&apos; rhu it isdoubtful whether the record system as such could in f act - achieve all that itsadvocates expect from it.   Records should be kept and statistics produced, but not for their own sake; it is important that any information released &quot;should be properljexplained.   The Government will not seek to impose on local govermtsefit-&quot;sstionally asystem which, like the cou&amp;t of iaaigrant pupils in schools? could mean thatstatistics collected at considerable cost in staff time, in a sensitive area- of social policy, would prove to be of little  practical use.17.     The Government believes that local authorities will need to develop a closer understanding of the total housing requirements of their districts,covering both the public and private sectors.   The Department of the*   &quot;Council Housing Purposes, Procedures and Priorities&quot; - Ninth report ofthe Housing Management Sub-Committee of the Central Housing AdvisoryCommittee 1969: Chapter 9.+     Paragraph h of Cmnd 5720 &quot;Educational Disadvantage and the EducationalNeeds of Immigrants&quot; explained that this count ceased from 1 January
Environment have commissioned research into techniques by which localauthorities might forecast the future housing requirements of their districts:the numbers of households of different sizes or with special needs (forinstance the elderly, the disabled, or the young and mobile), the balance between tenures, and similar factors.   They have also sponsored a number ofstudies of the workings of the housing market (that is the processes by whichhouseholds or individuals obtain and exchange housing in both the public and private sectors and the factors that influence their preferences and thechoices they make) in various towns.   The Department have also initiated a programme of joint work with the Local Authority Associations and the institute of Housing Managers about developing a new approach to housingmanagement, so that it can measure up to the newly emerging social needswhich can, for example, challenge traditional policies of allocation,management, and estimation of housing needso180     In the meantime, the Government belieyes that local authorities should seek to assemble, within current restraints on staff and money, the best in-formation they at present can about the range of housing problems in their areas, including the problems of the various groups whose needs are in one way or another special, and against whom, for lack of knowledge, there maybe unintentional discrimination.   In its view, the collection of relevant information about the housing situation and needs of coloured people shouldfornr part of authorities&apos; wider arrangements for understanding and dealingwith the housing and social problems of their area, and for housing managementpurposes; it will show how social problems are inter-related in central areastComprehensive and detailed information, which can be employed by authorities todetermine the policies and the action r required in their area, will be more useful in bringing about results than concentrating on formal records by reference tocolour alone, distinct from.need.19.     The information that a particular local authority will require aboutcoloured people (or others with urgent needs) will, like other information,depend on the nature and extent of the problems in its area.   But it isparticularly important for local authorities to have information about theareas of housing stress discussed above.   This should include information on coloured people, their tenures and conditions, and their re-housingeither privately or by local authorities or housing associations.   for housing stress areas, local authorities may need to go beyond broadly baseddata and require more detailed information for example in the form of in-formation about individual families or people, or by way of social survey0
Whatever information is collected about coloured people, however, it shouldbe capable of indicating in broad terms, in what proportion the colouredcommunity in the area are represented in the various forms of tenure -owner-occupation, private and council house tenancies - and in variousqualities and types of estate, compared with the proportion the colouredcommunity bears to the community as a whole; in what proportions colouredtenants are represented in these tenures along with residents generally; andthis information should be examined and analysed to establish better under-standing of its background causes.20.     The existing practices of local authorities vary, and no one approach is likely to command general acceptance at this stage.   The Govei*nmenttherefore proposes to ask local authorities to secure that, as part of theiroverall information system, they should collect such information about thenumbers and needs of coloured people as will enable them to make an informedjudgment about the effect of their policies and programmes in relation tothem, and to satisfy themselves that insofar as such policies and programmesmay influence more fundamental social and economic causes of inequality inour society, deprived coloured people have equality of opportunity of access to housing in both the public and private sectors.21.     The proposals extend significantly beyond the simple record-keepingproposed by the Select Committee and discussed previously with i;he localauthority associations and immigrant representatives,   Before finalguidance is issued, therefore, the Department of the Environment will need to hold further discussions with the local authority associations, immigrantrepresentatives, the Community Relations Commission and the Race relations board; and to take account of the views on monitoring expressed in theSelect Committee&apos;s most recent reportsDISPERSAL22.     Paragraphs 112-115 of the Report posed the question whether dispersalwas desirable, concluded that the answer would seem to be &quot;Yes&quot; and, while recognising that dispersal should always be a matter of individual choice,recommended that obstacles to it should, as far as possible, be removed.The Select Committee described its view as slightly different in emphasisfrom that of the Cullingworth Committee.   That Committee&apos;s Report concluded that dispersal was a laudable theme of policy, but needed to be pursuedv/ith full respect for the wishes of the people concerned; that dispersal of
immigrant concentrations should be regarded as a desirable consequence, notthe overriding purpose , of housing individual immigrant families on councilestates; and that the criterion&apos;of full, informed, individual choice camefirst.23o     The Governments view is that the question of dispersal cannot bedealt with adequately by a simple affirmative and that attention must bepaid to the qualifications in the two, reports,2ka     The Committee&apos;s report referred to three main arguments.   It saw oneof the reasons for dispersal as the opening up of economic, social (includinghousing) and educational opportunities.   Dispersal for these reasons, fromareas of housing and social stress, could help to open up possibilities forall those living there, irrespective of colour, whose opportunities are atpresent limited.    It would complement and form part of the approach set outin paragraph 10 aboves25.     The Report also referred to evidence put to the Committee which made clear that the gradual dispersal of coloured people among the rest of thecommunity would better serve the furtherence of good race relations.   Thisappears to be a somewhat different point and implies that greater contact between people of different colour will promote understanding, helpintegration and thereby lead to racial harmony.26.     The third point brought out in the Report was that there can often be a conflict between the desire to remain part of an established community and the wish to move, even in improved circumstances, to unfamiliar surround-ings.   This conflict can be felt by people of all colours.27.     The Government fully endorses the recommendation (No. 3) that obstacles to dispersal (v/hich could affect a variety of those living in bad conditions)should, as far as possible, be removed.   It also believes that people mustbe free to make up their own minds whether or not to move from establishedcommunities; that they should not be confined to an estate or an area norcompelled to leave simply on grounds of colour; that, by giving people an effective choice, the movement of immigrants into a wider community will takeplace freely (it has already started rather more quickly than with some previous -ious immigrant groups); that the most important question is not that of concentration versus dispersal, but of improving the housing, environment,educational and employment opportunities of the inner urban areas where
large numbers of coloured families will continue to live for some time tocome, whatever the rate of movement out; and pz^oviding the opportunities sothat coloured families, along with others, will in practice be able to moveout from the inner cities.28o     The Government does not at this stage consider it appropriate to go beyond this statement of policy, or to issue further guidance to localauthorities on this issue.   The pattern of settlement of coloured people,particularly as it changes over time, calls for consideration by authorit-ies in the light of the housing and other social conditions in their area,including the number of coloured people there, their cultural, social and family patterns, and their wishes.   The Government recognises that theposition can differ greatly between one area and another.   But it expectslocal authorities in whose area the issue is a material one to formulate a balanced view on it; and to take it into account as one factor in their general management policies and in the day to day allocation of their hous-ing stock, in planning forward programmes of building, redevelopment and improvement.    If, for instance, a Housing Action Area, General ImprovementArea or Priority Neighbourhood is declared in an area where coloured people have settled these issues might come to the fore and an authority which has declared such an area will want to ensure that the declaration is not seen as an attempt to enforce &quot;dispersal&quot; against the wishes of those concerned.CONCLUSION29*     The Government looks to local authorities and other organisations concerned to continue, in the light of this White Paper, to give their considered attention to the housing of coloured people as part of a sustained campaign to improve social conditions and community relations.
(confidential)ANNEXOBSERVATIONS ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEERecommendation 1:   The Department of the Environment should, as a matter of urgency start discussions with local authority representatives specificallyon the keeping of records and statistics in relation to housing, with a viewto formulating, after consultation with responsible immigrant organisations,an acceptable, fully comprehensive workable system, with proper safeguards for confidentiality.Comment;   As noted in paragraphs ll\ to 21 of the main reply, the government considers that local: authorities should collect relevant information about thehousing of coloured people, as part of a wider information system about the housingsituation and special housing needs of their areas.   The Department of the environment and the Welsh Office propose to hold consultations with the localauthority associations and other organisations before issuing guidance.Recommendation 2:   The Home Office should consider how best to give localauthorities advance notice of arrivals.Comment:   The great majority of Commonwealth citizens being admitted to the UnitedKingdom for settlement are the wives and children under 18 of Commonwealth citizenssettled here on 1 January 1973, when the Immigration Act 1971 came fully into force.Those dependants have a statutory right to enter this country provided that theyfirst obtain entry clearances from a British representative overseas.   An entryclearance is valid for use within 6 months of issue and a survey carried out in1969 showed that 86 per cent of dependants who arrive, do so within 2 months of receiving clearance^ a third of the clearances are never used at all, and not alldependants proceed to the addresses given in the application forms.   In thesec ircumstances it is not possible to devise satisfactory arrangements for givingadvance notification of arrival.   Dependants seeking to join the small number of workpermit holders currently coming here under the Immigration Act are not issued withentry clearances unless satisfactory arrangements for their accommodation have beenmade.
(confidential)Recommendation 3:   Obstacles to dispersal, which should always be a matter of individual choice,  should as far as possible be removed.Recommendation 5:   Local authorities which pursue a policy of gradual dispersalthroughout their areas in the allocation of council dwellings should continueto do so; this policy should be adopted by those which do not.Recommendation 7 s   At least the largest authorities should consider theappointment of welfare officers to deal with the dispersal of immigrants fromslum clearance areas.Recommendation 11: The Department of the Environment should make systematicinvestigation into the dispersal of immigrants and send circulars of advice tolocal authorities.Comments:   The Government1s general policy on the issue of dispersal in housing hasbeen set out in the main reply.The Government accepts that social and economic obstacles which unreasonably restricta citizen&apos;s choice of where to live should be removed; they fully endorserecommendation 3.Within the range of choice which needs to be left open to individuals and communities,the Government accepts that local authorities who pursue a constructive and balancedpolicy of dispersal by offering to prospective tenants a choice of council dwellingsover a wide geographical area, can help to open up new possibilities xo their colouredresidents and to avoid the sorts of problems which might arise from their concentration in less desirable estates.   In this sense, they endorse Recommendation 5 and commendit to local authorities.Local authorities already have a clear duty to take into account the-housing needsof all the people in their area.   The appointment of welfare officers is one of the ways which local authorities, particularly the largest, are adopting to keep in touchwith all residents (whether coloured or not) of clearance areas who have to bere-housed.   Local authorities will no doubt take note of the value the Reportattached to this useful means of communication with those affected by clearance action.The Government does not consider that it would be appropriate at this stage for a circular of advice to be issued on the subject of dispersal.
(confidential)Recommendation li:   The Government should make an early appraisal of what is needed to enable immigrants to find work in new and expanding towns and tomove out of the overcrowded city centres.Coiraient;   The same facilities for obtaining jobs and houses in the new and expanding towns are open to immigrants as are open to the rest of the community.The reasons why relatively few coloured people go to live in most of the new and expanding towns are not yet fully understood.   The Government has commissioned research project by the Community Relations Commission to examine minority needsarid the potential opportunities for them in new and expanding towns and the proceduresby which people generally move to those towns.   The project will consider a number of factors which may bear upon an individuals decision to move or not to move to a newtown, eg economic factors, family and cultural networks, fear of hostility etc andwill attempt to identify means of removing any obstacles which exist and so encourageout-migration to the new and expanding towns.The Government accepts that immigrants, as well as other groups in&apos;poor housing conditions in city centres, should be encouraged to make use of the machinery forsaving to the new and expanding towns.   In a recent consultation paper, &quot;New Townsin England and Wales&quot; the Government has indicated that in future development corporations will be asked to pay special attention to providing a proportion of their houses for those living in conditions of housing stress and that the allocation of housing for this purpose should not be dependent upon employment in the new town.A ineiuorandum about the research project and the relationship of new towns to problems of ethnic minorities was submitted to the Select Committee in May 1975 inconnection with its latest investigation into the organisation of race relationsadministration.Recommendation 6:   Local authorities should take into account, x^hen building newhomes, the need of many immigrants for larger housing units.fo^entr  In both their new building and conversion and improvement programmes,local authorities have a duty to take account of the needs of all those, includingMaigrants, living in their areas,   Although recent advice (in DOE Circular 2ij/75)-las emphasised the need for, and desirability of, smaller dv-rellings, the GovernmentcciiEiends to local authorities the provision of larger housing units in aress wherevhsy are needed.   Paragraph 16 of the appendix to the joint circular on hcmelessnessoi&quot; 7 February (DOE lB/7h, DHSS JU/7U, Welsh Office 3U/7U) stressed the importance of^equate provision for large families who often have great difficulty in findingsuitable accommodation.__      confidential)
(confidential)Recommendation 8:   Local authorities should bear in mind the desire for separate places of worship and the need for sites on which to build them.Comment: The Government commends this recommendation to the attention of localauthorities.Recommendation 9: All bodies concerned should consider to what extent they cawfollow the most successful experiments on sponsoring or encouraging courses jigspoken English.Comment:   The Government agrees with the Select Committee on the importance of teaching spoken English to immigrant adults and values the work which local educationauthorities and voluntary bodies are doing to this end:   it has considered thisrecommendation with those made by the Select Committee in their 1973 Report on education and 197H Report on Employment, and schemes to promote language training allthe place of work were introduced by a number of local authorities last year, with Iassistance from the Government.Recommendation 10:   There should be established a standing committee of repress!tatives of all the London Boroughs specifically to consider dispersal and the!best means of co-operation towards it.Comment^   Dispersal by movement to new and expanding towns is already an acceptedmethod of helping to deal with housing shortage and unsatisfactory conditions inLondon.   The machinery exists to deal with dispersal on this basis and in the light Ithe needs of London as a whole:   it is kept under review by the Greater London Corneland the London Boroughs Association,iThe question of relative densities of housing between inner and outer boroughs isalso important in the Greater London area.   The Department of the Environment wishes!to promote the expansion of local authority housing programmes in boroughs where lanjis more plentiful to help relieve pressure on the more hard pressed inner Boroughs.It has asked the outer boroughs to submit details of their projected housing programmes and will be discussing with them.confide nts a
(confidential)Recommendation 12:   All local authorities should make a speedy appraisal of how far the housing needs of immigrants in particular may be met by a vigorouspolicy of urban renewal through rehabilitation.Recommendation 13:   The Department of the Environment should study closely theadvantages of an accelerated programme of rehabilitation., should give advice to local authorities on it, and should consider what improved financial arrangements would be appropriate.Comment:   In so far as immigrants live in areas of housing stress, they will be helped by the Government&apos;s policies for dealing with urban deprivation.   It would be neither appropriate nor practicable to single out immigrants for special help.   the under the Housing Act 197h will provide extra powers and assistance to tackle living conditions in the worst areas of stress.   By improving those houses which have notslipped into irredeemable unfitness, these measures offer an alternative to large scale redevelopment.   A gradual process of re-building and rehabilitation can, inconjunction, regulate urban renewal in such a way as to avoid, wherever possible, the disruption of established communities.   The housing action area measures are, inparticular designed specifically to secure, inter alia, ths well-being of the persons for the time being residing in the area.Recommendation lU;   All local authorities concerned should...the^^anew on^^hatadditional help and advice. thsy; can give to housing associations in.their areasof poor housing; and where there are none, or not enough, what they can do to foster; them.Cjpjninent:   Department of the Environment Circular 170/7a (Welsh Office 2lWlh)described the increased financial support provided for housing associations under theprovisions of the Housing Act 197U? and made clear the Government&apos;s view that housing associations have an important role to play in helping local authorities to meet thewhole range of housing needs, especially in stress areas,   Local authorities aremaking an increasing use of housing associations in the way suggested in the Circular.Recommendation 15: The Department of the Environment should give guidance on whether the sale of houses improved by housing ^associations is legal., and, ifnot-, whether it should be made so.Comment:   Under the provisions of section 2 of the Housing Act 197k registered housing associations may not dispose of any land or property without the consent of theHousing Corporation, and even unregistered housing associations may not dispose ofland or property which has been provided with the assistance of public finance.   the corporations consent would be given only in exceptional circumstances, since theGovernment&apos;s policy is that housing associations should provide the maximum mount of delclaration by local authorities of housing action areas and priority neighbourhoods
(confidential)accommodation to let at a moderate rent.Recommendation 16: The National Federation of Housing Societies should consider how best to rationalise housing associations waiting lists.Comment:   The National Federation of Housing Societies (now the National Federationof Housing Associations) gave evidence to the Select Committee on this matter.   the rationalisation of waiting lists to avoid duplication would in effect involve theestablishment of a comprehensive central letting service which would be very-expensive and cumbersome to operate, and would conflict with the local identity of housing associations, who in many cases accept tenants referred to them by localbodies operating in the social services field, and who also normally agree to accepta high proportion of nominations from local authorities.   Most housing associationsdo not in fact keep long waiting lists, because they think it is better to give priority to those in the greatest need at the time when the housing becomes available.Recommendation 17:   All local authorities in whose areas pvercrowcling occursshould form, as soon as possible, a reasonably exact estimate of its extent and location.Comment;   Section 70 of the Housing Act 1969 (as extended by the Housing Act 197h)gives local authorities a statutory duty to inspect their areas from time to time with a view to determining what action to take in the performance of a wide range oftheir housing functions, including those relating to multiple-occupation.[The Government -agrees that -action directed to the reduction of overcrowding should beifirmly based on reliable information as to its extent, location, and causes.Although it will be necessary for on the ground inspection to precede action on individual properties, local authorities will be able to form estimates of the extentof overcrowding and multiple occupation and of its distribution within their districtsnot only from the knowledge of their professional officers but also from 1971 censusdata, which has become available since the Committee reported and which indicates foreach enumeration district the numbers of households living at over 1.5   persons perroom and of households sharing accommodation, and from local sources such as electoralregisters.
Recommendation 18:   Local authorities which do not already do so should, putnotices in overcrowded multi-occupied houses to ensure that when rooms arevacated they are not again occupied.Comment:   Section 19 of the Housing Act 1961 gives local authorities a flexible powerto reduce or control the level of occupation of houses in multiple occupation,regardless of whether there is overcrowding as statutorily defined in the housing act 1957* having regard to the amenities and means of escape from fire provided in them.   If at the time a direction is given there are more people occupying the housethan it allows then they do not lose their security of tenure or have to moveimmediately; it is however, an offence to permit anyone to take up residence if thiswould involve exceeding a limit set in a direction.   A direction may specify limits for parts of houses including individual rooms.   When a direction has been made, acop;/ must be posted up in the house where it is accessible to those living in thehouse.   The Government encourages local authorities to use Section 19 where conditionsin houses in multiple occupation call for it.Recommendation 19:   Local, authorities, should.grant mortgages on-larger housessuitable for multi-occupation only on condition that overcrowding will not occur.Comment:   Local authorities have power to grant mortgage loans to applicants whowant to buy larger property only for partial occupation by themselves.   Localauthorities have been advised that in areas where conditions of overcrowding seem likely to develop, the Secretaries of State would expect the council to include intheir mortgage agreement conditions enabling the council as mortgagees to approve the number of other people to whom the mortgagor may offer lettings.&apos; Recommendation 20:    Local authorities which do not have registration schemes should consider their use.Coimugnt:   Since the date of the Committee&apos;s report, 16 registration schemes madeunder section 22 of the Housing Act 1961 (as amended and extended by the housing acts 196b, and 1969) have come into effect, there having previously been 15 such schemestogether with one made under a&apos;\Local Act.   When the Housing Act 1969) under which&quot;control provisions&quot; may be included in registration schemes, came into force a departmental Circular&apos; (XHLG Circular 67/69, Welsh Office Circular 66/69) recommendedauthorities with substantial problems of multiple occupation to consider making aregulatory scheme containing such provisions.   The Department ask each authority whomake a scheme to submit a short report after two years and it appears that.although in some areas schemes have been useful they are not everywhere a worthwhile addition1 &apos;     .
to other powers.   Thus whilst the Government does not disagree with the Committee^recommendation, it advises authorities to consider carefully whether the problemsassociated with multiple occupation in their areas are such that the registrationprovisions would be relevant to them.Recommendation 21:   Where there are-.-ypung-bpys living; in all-male households,local authorities, should,, as a matter of priority, inquire into the situation,take what local action they can, and inform- the Home Office.Comment;Provision was made in the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968 and is continued in thecurrent.Immigration Rules to prevent children from coming to the United Kingdom,save in exceptional, circumstances, unless both parents accompany them or are alreadyHere. It is believed that as a result of the&apos;se measures and tha steps which theGovernment is taking to accelerate the arrival of immigrants.&apos; families,  the problem is substantially reduced.Recommendation 22s There should be a more concerted and strongly directed efforttowards the elimination of overcrowding due to multiple occupation.Consent:   The provisions of the Housing Act 197U for housing action areas (HAAs) andpriority neighbourhoods (PHs) which came into effect on 2 December 197k are intendedto strengthen the hand of local authorities needing to tackle areas of stress whereprogress depends upon a determined concentration of effort.   HAAs and PNs are to beareas where physical and social factors combine and interact to create unsatisfactoryliving conditions.   The guidance which, under the Act, the Secretary of State for the environment has given to local authorities In England as to the selection of HAAsincludes among the principal social indicatros to which authorities should have regardsi. the proportion of households sharing cooking facilities, a bath, a watercloset or other facilities, and ii. &quot;the proportion of households living at a density of over &quot;1.5 persons perroom (or any other relevant measure of overcrot^ding)The corresponding guidance for Wales also singles out these indicators though, becauseof the different nature of housing problems there, they are given slightly lessemphasis.   Within HAAs, local, authorities will be mounting comprehensive actionprograripjies designed to improve living conditions in the interests of the existingresidents not only by physical improvement of the housing but also by tackling thesoeial factors contributing to stress.
Recommendation 23:   The Government should hold appropriate consultations witha view to legislation providing that loan agreements for the purchase ofdwellingsand advertisements in connection with them, should mention a rate ofinterest not less thanthe-effective rate.Comment:   This recommendation was considered by the Government in the light of therecommendation of the Crowther Committee on Consumer Credit that the cost of borrowing,in terms of a rate per cent per annum, should be stated in all advertisements of consumer credit facilities in which reference is made to the cost of borrowing orbuying on credit, or to any element of such cost.   Following the publication of theirWhite Paper &quot;Reform of the Law on Consumer Credit&quot; (Cmnd 5U27; September 1973), theprevious Administration introduced legislation which the Government reintroduced(with certain modifications) and which subsequently became the Consumer Credit Act 197h:\Regulations which it is intended to make under the Act are likely to provide that anyadvertiser must either mention the interest rate in his advertisement or must beprepared to supply such information on demand.   The regulations will apply toadvertisements for loans of any size for the purchase of dwellings, no matter by whomgranted, or advertised.   As far as agreements are concerned, the position is more complex.   The Act covers these within a stated limit ( 5,000) and at a true interestrate above a prescribed limit, but it does not cover agreements made by building societies and other recognised house purchase lenders (eg local authorities) because it is not the intention to complicate building society and house conveyancing law.Recommendation 2u:   Local authorities should be encouraged to take &quot;full advantageof the abolition of ceilings on local authority loans.Comment:   It has been found necessary to re-impose ceilings on local authority mortgagelending,,   Within the limits it is proposed that the existing priority categories ofborrower will continue to apply; these include purchasers of older property suitablefor single family occupation for which it may be difficult to obtain a commercialmortgage.Recommendation 25:   The attention of building societies Jmd^local authoritiesshould be drawn to the provisions of section      of the Housing (FinancialP:.r.ovirsi^6ns^^tri9&quot;58. and; they should be encouraged ^to use it when they can,together jft^th the provisions of the option mortgage scheme.Comment:   Section L,5 of the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act 1958 enables localauthorities, with the approval of the Secretary of State, to guarantee the repayment of advances by building societies.   These provisions are little used because there isalready a system of mortgage indemnity insurances provided by insurance companies and    IIbecause of the growth of the option mortgage guarantee scheme which was introduced inr?*r\M^snpmti a a ^\
(confidential)section 30 of the Housing Subsidies Act 1967.   Under the option mortgage guaranteescheme building societies are willing to grant option mortgages higher than normaladvances on properties up to a value of  12,000.   The loan is guaranteed by insurance companies and the Government.   There is no charge made for the Governments participation in the scheme so that the insurance premium paid by the option mortgagor is less than would otherwise be the case.   32,000 option mortgages were guaranteed in 197h*10,000 of which were guaranteed in the October-December quarter.Recommendation 26: All buildingjsoeieities, and the Building Societies association in particular, should consider to what extent they can contribute to the buying of older property by varying their interest rates according to the type of property.Comment:   The Building Societies Association have been consulted and in their view it would be undesirable to make a general practice of varying mortgage rates accordingto the age of property.   The societies in general have safeguards other than special interest rates against any unusual risks they may incur on older property, such asthe level, of valuation for the property concerned or possibly an indemnity guarantee.Recommendation 27:   In studying the report^of the Francis Committee, theOivoverrjient should take account,.of--puri evidence.Comments:   The powers given to housing authorities in the Housing Act 197U to declarehousing action areas and priority neighbourhoods, and thereafter to exercise the newpowers available to them in these areas, will to a great extent meet the points theSelect Committee had in mind in paragraphs I84-I87 of their report.   As the SelectCommittee will know, the Rent Act 197k has now extended security of tenure to furnishedtenants other than those whose landlords live in the same building.Recommendation 28:   The Department of the Environment should take steps to tightenthe law on rent books,Comment:   Amendments have been made to the regulations covering rent books, but theGovernment has no immediate proposals for extending the present requirement that a landlord must make a rent book available for a tenancy for which the rent is payableweekly since the xiajority of non-weekly tenants normally have some formal contract withtheir landlord.
(confidential)Recommendation 29: The Government should consider to what extent employers should be made responsible for ensuring that accommodation is available for new immigrant workers.Comment:   Many of the areas of labour shortage to which migrants havebaen attracted suffeifrom inadequate housing and the Government accepts that employers should take accountof this in recruiting labour, though it should be pointed out that new immigration islikely to constitute only a small element in the future requirements for housing.Recommendation 30: The Department of the Environment should study the wording ofthe relevant Acts relating to harassment to see where minor amendments could bite.Comment:   The working of section 30(2) of the Rent Act 1965 relating to the offences of harassment and illegal eviction has been reviewed.   As recommended by the Committeeon the Rent Act, section 30 of the Criminal Justice Act 1972 has increased the penalties for harassment - they are now, on summary conviction, a fine not exceeding ijOO or imprisonment for up to six months, or both, and on conviction on indictment,a fine or imprisonment for up to 2 years or both.   As regards the wording of the 1965 -Actitself, however, the Government is not satisfied that any further amendment would bean improvement on the present provisions and although these provisions are kept under continuous review, the Government has at present no proposals for legislation in this field.Recommendation 31:   Local, authorities which know of, or suspect., harassment intheir areas should consider allocating: to one of their staff the duty of assessingits extent and following up alleged cases.Comment: - Coloured immigrants are not ailone in being susceptible to harassment.   Wherethe problem exists the Government considers that the local authorities are themselvesbest placed to decide what to do about it and how to organise their staff to deal with it.   The Department of Environment Circular 15/73 reminded local authorities of theincreased penalties for harassment and unlawful eviction and encouraged them -to use their ample powers to obtain legal remedies to the full.II
Recommendation 32:   Immigrant and other organisations should report incidents ofalleged unlawful discrimination to the Race Relations Board.   The Board shouldenergetically seek to improve and increase its information about what the race relations Act&quot;&quot;T9^T&quot;ofiers.   The Communit?/ Relations Commission and its local councils should help in this.Comment:   The Government fully endorses the encouragement of those who consider that thejjhave suffered unlawful discrimination to take up the matter with the Race relations board.   The Board has intensified its publicity activities to ensure that as many people as possible are aware of how the law works3 the Community Relations commission is also endeavouring to increase public awareness in this area.Recommendation&apos;33:,   Local authorities should give maximum publicity to theirrules and practices.   They should ensure that all their officers are clearly aware of their policies.   Those which have residential qualifications should closelyana regularly scrutinise them to see if they are really needed.Comment:   The Government notes that the Committee found little evidence that the policies of local authorities were discriminatory on grounds of race or colour, or that these policies were not properly carried out by most local authority officers.However, the Government strongly commends the recommendations to local authorities,not only in relation to immigrants but as matters of good management practice.aw theRecommendation 3U:   All^building^ societies and estate agenta should draattention of their branches and associates to the Raoa Relations Act, andimpress on their officials that discriminatory policies will not be countenanced.Comment:   Discrimination on grounds of race in the provision of facilities for loans,credit or finance and, with certain minor exceptions, in the disposal of housing accommodation is unlawful under the terms of the Race Relations Act 1968.   The building societies Association is satisfied that officials and agents of building societiesare already aware of this position.   The Department of Trade has drawn the attentionof societies and institutions which include estate agents in their membership to theCommittee1s recommendations,Recommendation 35:   Housing aid centres should be widely established. ln,qne&apos; *&apos;orm or another, to deal not only with public bub, where appropriate, private housing._Basic essential features ought to be: ease of access; a relaxedatmosphere: adequate staff; positive aid - which means direct links to all departments concerned with housing problems.Recommendation 36:    The Department ofnthe Environment should encourage and helplocali author!ties to further progress, in sett.in:; up housing-aid aentres.(2. &apos;(CONFIDENTIAL9* mum iubmm WMmwwmnMiwiijMiH m^mtitwijwwwimowiBrimBiiJiiwiiW
(confidential)Recommendation 37s   Widespread publicity, including whenever possible the useof&apos; cinemas, local radio and television, should be given to housing aid centreswhen they are set up, the help of voluntary bodies, including immigrantorganizations, enlisted and c3.ase contact maintained with building societies and estate agents.Comment;   The Government shares the view that housing aid centres (HACs) are desirable, particularly in areas of housing stress, so as to provide people with information and guidance on housing matters in both the public and the private sectors.Some 1U5 HACs are known to the Department of the Environment to be operating inEngland at present, of which about 80 are administered by local authorities and theremainder by voluntary bodies; more are in the process of being set up.   Most of theseHACs have opened since the Committee reported in 1971.Many HACs are in stress areas.   There are, for instance, 55 of them in Greater London.Some 60 grants have been made by the Home Office in consultation with the Departmentof the Environment under the Local Government Grants (Social Needs) Act 1969 (the&quot;Urban Aid Programme&quot;) for the establishment of HACs or to assist their operation.Most HACs have been well publicized locally and have established links withbodies such as those mentioned in recommendation 37.   HACs normally deal with both public and private sector housing problems and the Government agrees with theCommittee that this is right.Recommendation 38: The Government should, consider the implementation of thereport of the Advisory Committee on the better provision of legal Advice and assistance in so far as it relates to housing.Comment:   Parliament has enacted the Legal Advice and Assistance Act 1972 which giveseffect to the recommendations of the Legal. Aid Advisory Committee&apos;s Report.   Parts 1and 3 of this Act were brought into force on 2 April 1973, the Act has now beenconsolidated, to form part of the Leg til Aid Act 197k-Recommendation 39: Lpcal authorities and other bodies^should consider what^furtheruse they can make of publicity and of home visiting.Comment:   The Government commends this recommendation to local authorities and voluntary organisations working in. concert with them.   However, they accept that anyproposed extensions of existing practices must be considered in the light of currentrestrictions on local authority expenditure.
(confidential)Recommendation hO:   Responsible immigrant organisations should keep in touch with local authorities so that they can usefully extend communications with their members on housing matters.   The Community Relations Commission should increase its efforts &quot;to help such organisations to do so.Comment:   Local community relations councils and other groups have been increasinglyactive over the past few years in promoting greater contact between local authority housing departments and &quot;immigrant1 communities.   The Community Relations commission has appointed a senior housing officer to undertake work in this field.   The Governmentwelcomes these moves.Recommendation: hit   All appropriate local authorities should consider theHrcployment of immigrants on their staffs, particularly where they may expect to make frequent contact with fellow immigrants.Comment:,  The recruitment of local authority staff and their allocation to particularthis recommendation.   The Government recommends that local authorities should considergiving appropriate training to officials who are likely to come in contact withimmigrants.Recommendation U2:   The Department of the Environment should set up a small groupIt regards the bodies - principally local authorities, housing associations, building societies, and housing aid centres - normally responsible for providing housing andthe financial, legal and other services connected with it as best able to decide howmost effectively to interpret the wide and complex range of housing matters, in practical terms, to those (including immigrants) who should know about them.:Recommendation h3&apos;   The Department of theiiEnvironment, local authorities concerned and - such national bodies as those representing estate agents, building societies and, housing associations , should begin or -expand^   - the publication ofhbusing infomat ion in other, languages.Comment:   The housing literature Issued by the Department of the Environment which is most relevant to the matters covered by the Select Committee&apos;s Report is alreadypvi.bli.$lied in a variety of languages.   This practice will be continued.   Many localauthorities with immigrant populations also publish    housing material in appropriateduties is a matter for the authorities themselves but they have no doubt taken note ofComment:   The Government does not consider, that the establishment of a centralGovernment study group is likely to lead to worthwhile improvements in this field.
(CONFIDENTIAL)Recommendation hki   The Government should make arrangements to ensure that future immigrants are given as much information as possible about the housingsituation in Britain either before they leave their homeland or immediately upon arrival here.   &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Icqmnent:   Most new immigrants are impelled to seek housing in the vicinity of theijobs to which they are coming, and detailed information on housing is not likely toIbe of much use to them before they leave home.   Entry Certificate Officers abroad distribute to immigrants, before their departure for this country, copies of theiLeaflet &quot;Introduction to Britain&quot; which gives general guidance on a number of subjects,including housing in this country.   The leaflet also says where further, more detailed,advice can be obtained after arrival here.   This leaflet is revised from time to timeto keep it up to date.Recommendation U5i   All local authorities involved should take vigorous actiontowards the provision and encouragement of pre-school activities and amenitiesin deprived areas, paying particular attention to the special difficulties ofchildren of immigrants.Recommendation U6:   The Government should consider sympathetically applications from local authorities under the urban programme directed to these ends.Comment:   In invitations issued in recent years to submit applications for urban programme Grants, the attention of local authorities (and of voluntary organisationsviho might wish to submit proposals to local authorities) has been drawn to theimportance attached to provision of pre-school facilities and amenities in areas ofspecial social need, including areas where there are large numbers of immigrants.Facilities suggested have included family centres, boarding-out and day fosteringschemes (including schemes of training for child minders), mothers&apos; and toddlers&apos; groups and play groups.Since these recommendations were made, the Government has begun a programme for theexpansion of nursery education, within which the socially deprived areas are receiving priority; see the observation (in Grand. 5720, &quot;Educational Disadvantage andfte Educational Needs of Immigrants&quot;) on Recommendation lh of the Select Committee&apos;s19(3 Report on Education.   Now that the Education Department allocate resources fornursery education building, applications for this purpose are no longer invited undertoe Urban Programme,V j
