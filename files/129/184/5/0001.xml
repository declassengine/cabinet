This note attempts to set out the main issues which Ministers will need to consider when they discuss the Medium-Term EconomicAssessment (MTA) (C(75) 78) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ paper(C(75) 79).2. Decisions about the levels of public expenditure in the medium termneed to be based on judgments about:What is the likely growth of output in relation to trends in productivity, the size of the labour force, and the level ofunemploy ment.What are the needs ofi. the balance of payments, and ii. productive investment.After deducting these needs from the likely growth in output, what should be the balance between the resources taken by public expenditure and those left for private consumption.What are the main uncertainties and risks; in particular, the costof basing decisions on mistaken assumptions.a.    Output and Unemployment (MTA paragraphs 4-8)3.        The MTA assumes:a. Little increase in the size of the population seeking work.b. Productivity in the economy as a whole rising in line withpast trends - ie just under 3 per cent a year.
c.        Unemployment in the last years of this decade at the same level as the 1970-74 average - ie about 3 per cent.4,        Ministers may begin by considering whether these are the mostsensible working assumptions.    Two relevant points are:So far as productivity is concerned, there is no evidence of anyacceleration in the trend; indeed, recent performance has been disappointing, and the present low levels of investment may have some adverse effect in 1978-79.So far as unemployment is concerned, it is at present risingsharply: to assume that it can be brought back to the 1970-74average assumes both a major success in handling inflation and thatreturning to past levels of unemployment is compatible with thenecessary flexibility required to move labour and capital into exports and import substitution.b.i.    The Balance of Payments (MTA paragraphs 9-12)5.        The MTA takes as an objective getting back into external balanceduring 1978.   In discus sing this objective, Ministers may ask why 1978?Would it be possible to ease the domestic resource constraints by going forbalance in a later year, or by assuming more help from North Sea oil?i i uUncertainties about delays in production and rising costs mean thatit would be unwise to rely more on North Sea oil than is assumed inthe MTA.Balance during 1978 already implies running up external debt to theorder of  10- 15 billion; postponing external balance till later meansbigger debts.Recent events have demonstrated very sharply the internationaldoubts about our credit worthiness: unless we cure our inflation wemay well be unable to borrow even  10- 15 billion.It is possible that, if there were a dramatic success in reducinginflation, confidence would improve, and the borrowing positionwould be easier.    But dare we base this year&apos;s decisions on such an assumption?If there is a strong recovery in world trade in 1976 and 1977, theUnited Kingdom should have the export capacity to take advantage ofit; if there is not, both the balance of payments and the unemploy-ment situation would be very difficult.
b.ii.    Productive Investment (MTA paragraph 13)6.        The MTA allows for a growth in total industrial fixed investment of5 per cent a year, 1974-79: nationalised industries investment is shownrising by 6jj per cent a year, and private sector investment (excludinghouse building and stocks) by about 4f per cent a year.7.        In considering the provision for private investment, it may be relevant to note:The figure is not a forecast: it is an estimate of the rate of investment which would be consistent with the normal trend growth of productive capacity.Private investment is at present low and falling; the MTA provisionsupposes that this fall should be reversed, and allowance made fora considerable upswing after 1976,It is difficult to say whether this increase will in fact be achieved;but unless provision is made for it, resources which might have gone to productive investment will have been pre-empted in advance,c.    Public Expenditure and Private Consumption (MTA paragraphs 14-20)8, The distribution of the increase in gross domestic product (GDP)1974-79 proposed in the MTA is quite abnormal in that two thirds are pre-empted for the &quot;prior claims&quot; of investment and the balance of payments,leaving only one third to be shared between public expenditure andprivately financed consumption.    The share going to production investment is a little higher than normal in that stocks are being rebuilt from a very low base in 1974,    But the main abnormality is the claims of the balance ofpayments.    Since Ministers last considered the prospects for the medium term, the need for an early return to balance has become stronger, theprospects for North Sea oil in 1978 are less favourable, and the prospects for the terms of trade look worse.    This is the main reason why theoutlook for public expenditure and privately financed consumption is so muchmore difficult than appeared even last year.    After allowing for the balanceof payments and productive investment, the MTA shows public expenditure and private consumption together as rising on average by about 1^ per cent between 1974 and 1979, with public expenditure (on present programmes)riding by just under 2 per cent and privately financed consumption by lessthan 1 per cent,9.        Ministers will need to consider whether this prospect is acceptable:Will it be possible to get inflation under control and then keep it under control if real take-home pay is rising by less than 1 per cent a year - an imperceptible rate of improvement?
Are the very large increases in taxation which this prospect implies(MTA paragraphs 17-19) politically acceptable, or consistent with themaintenance of incentives or anti-inflation objectives?10.       If Ministers conclude that such a prospect for private consumption and taxation is unacceptable or unlikely to prove viable, they will need tomake more resources available for privately financed consumption by reducing public expenditure below present programmes.d.    Risks and Uncertainties11.        Before deciding whether public expenditure programmes should bereduced, and by how much, they will need to consider how the uncertaintiesinherent in the MTA could affect that decision.12.       So far as the analysis itself is concerned, there is little reason forthinking that the growth of output has been underestimated; indeed it couldwell turn out to be on the optimistic side.    Against this, the provision forincreased private investment could prove to be on the high side.    In factquite a large redaction in the growth of private investment could easily be offset by a slightly lower growth of output.    For example, if the rate of growth of investment were only two-thirds of what has been assumed, thisrelease of resources would be more or less completely offset if GDP growthwas 3 per cent instead of the 3,2 per cent the MTA assumes.13.       The analysis assumes that i. the balance of payments has beenbrought back into balance during 1978, and ii. that inflation has been brought under control in the medium as well as the short term.    These are boldassumptions.    Persistently high inflation, in particular, would almost certainly make the prospects for output worse, partly because it might prove impossible to reduce unemployment to the extent which the MTAsupposes, and partly because of the possible disruptive effect of highinflation on industrial relations and on investment.    It could also have veryadverse effects on our international trading position,14.       The MTA is set out in terms of the allocation of real resources.The financial prospect which goes with this allocation of resources is:a, A very large public sector deficit in 1975 and 1976.b, A public sector deficit reduced to normal proportions (iearound t\ per cent of GDP) by about 1979.c, A very sharp fall in the public sector deficit in 1977 and 1978,i    when it is hoped that world trade will be expanding, the balance ofpayments improving rapidly, and private investment in the UnitedKingdom recovering,
15.       The counterpart to the reduction in the public sector deficit is anincrease in the tax burden.    The MTA calculates (paragraph 20) that evenif public expenditure in total were held constant from now on, there would need to be a large increase in tax rates to achieve balance in the allocation of resources.    The 18 per cent growth in public expenditure of the past twoyears has still to be matched by increased taxation.    At the moment, withexceptionally high saving by the private sector and a large balance ofpayments deficit, we can live with a very large public sector deficit.    Butthe time will come when we have to increase taxes to cover more of ourpast increases in public expenditure.    After uprating all indirect taxes in line with inflation, the necessary increase in income tax would be of theorder of 2-4p.    As was said above, impact of this increased tax burdencould well be most acute in 1977 and 1978, because the pressures on resources may then be strongest,e.    Public Expenditure Options16.       If public expenditure is based on assumptions which prove over-optimistic, then there is a high risk that, as has so often happened in thepast, programmes will have to be cut back hastily in a crisis atmosphere.The dislocation and social and political cost caused by a rapid transition in public expenditure programmes from past rapid growth to, at best, zerogrowth for some years has to be weighed against the major macro-economic risks and costs set out in the MTA.    This will be highly relevantwhen Ministers come to discuss priorities between programmes.17.       The MTA examines two possibilities:i. Carrying on with present programmes.    This implies animperceptibly slow rate of growth of privately financed consumption,and an extremely large increase in the tax burden.ii. Reducing total public expenditure in 1979 by  2 billion belowpresent programmes.    This implies:a. Holding public expenditure broadly constant from nowuntil 1978-79.b. A much smaller, but still significant, increase in the tax burden18.       The Chancellor recommends:i. That the Cabinet agree now to reduce totals in 1978-79 by 2 billion.ii. That the possibility of reductions going beyond  2 billionshould be explored when the detailed reports of the Public expenditure survey are available in September.
QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION19.       Ministers may wish to concentrate on the following centralquestions:1, Do they regard the basic MTA assumptions about output,unemployment, the balance of payments and productive investment as an acceptable basis for planning public expenditure in the medium term?    (See paragraphs 3-7 above.)2. Do they accept that the picture could in practice be a gooddeal more difficult, particularly if inflation were not kept under control in the years beyond the  6 flat rate increase and that the chances of things being a good deal better than the MTA projectionsare less strong,3,        If public expenditure programme s are set too high, there isa serious risk of further disruptive cuts in a crisis atmospherelater on.    What weight do Ministers give to keeping programmesdown to levels which have a good chance of being implementedrather than aiming on the high side in the hopes that the economy will perform well and the programmes can be afforded,4.        Are the Chancellor*s proposals accepted?    (A  2 billionreduction implies decelerating to roughly zero growth now, andkeeping public expenditure roughly constant until 1978-79).Cabinet Office10 July 1975
