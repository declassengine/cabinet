Thesame limit is being set   for dividends.&quot; -5 &quot;We propose to fix cash.limits for wage bills in the public sector and will take action through the&apos;Price Code to encourage compliance by private employers..
The Government welcomes the efforts the TUC havealready made to arrive at a plan for lower pay increases in the next round.   We would much prefer to proceed on the basis of a voluntary policy agreed with the cbi and TUC. But a voluntary policy will not be acceptable to the Government unless it satisfies the targets it has set for reducing inflation and includesconvincing arrangements for ensuring compliance;   If,however, no agreement can be reached which meets theseconditions, the Government will be obliged to legislateto impose a legal requirement in both public and private sector employers to comply with the 10 per cent limit.The Government will annouce its decisions in a white paper to be published before the end of next week- &quot;6 The following day at the meeting of the NEDC,the Chancellor made a further statement that&quot;theGovernment was totally opposed to the application of criminal sanctions against workers or unions
pay       Adopting a flat rate approach, fixing the pay limit at10 per cent would give  6 a week to all full-time adults (aged18 and above) up to a cut off point, with pro rata payments for part-timers and juveniles.    A flat rate approach has theadvantages? of focusing increases or; the low paid and preventingunduly-large cash increases being obtained by &quot;the high paid. It isclear and simple, most emphasises the General-Council1s viewabout the gravity of . the - economic - and industrial situation,and cuts through the complication of separate provisions for particular groups which, via comparability claims, had.-helped to weaken the previous policy. The General Council therefore conclude that -there should be a universal application of the figure of 6 per weak.--The-TUC will&apos; &quot;oppose any settlement in excess ofthis, figure. . isfe x 12   ; ,-,The General Council fully appreciate the problems whichmay, arise from interfering-*-with differentials based on skill and responsibility, and emphasise that.this    is a temporary policy putforward for the coming ^year to arrest then inflationary process,,prevent massive unemployment and enable, the.- Labour Government tocarry out its industrial programme.    It is certainly not envisagedas a permanent policy for continually eroding differentials eitherbetween or within negotiating groups.3       The policy will operate from the beginning , of thejaextpay round, which is about August 1.    Those who have settlementdates before then should settle within the existing guidelines.There should be no anticipation of their normal settlementdate by other groups.4       Given problems arising from the fact of different paystructures, the cash amount should be applied as a straight-forward supplement to earnings.    This should be the total
increase over the year however the earnings are deter-mined.   The policy will entail the temporary suspension of systems of pay determination based on traditionallinks in the private and public sector;, and the suspension-sion in particular of civil service comparabilityexercises.   Already established incremental and wage-for-age scales are payable provided that this does not raise the overall wage bill by more than  6 per head.The General Council would, if it is considered necessary,agree to legislation to relieve employers of contractual obligations which would compel them to increase pay abovethe limits set out in this document.   This is necessaryto enable this policy to be applied voluntarily in every case.5       The twelve month interval between major pay increasesmust continue to apply.   This rule means that when a newsettlement is negotiated thereafter, it should be on a flat rate basis of  6.   Where current agreements providepayments in the 12-month period, any new agreement should ensure that only the balance between the amount paid andthe  6 should be applicable in the period up to August 11976.6      However, final steps towards the attainment of equal pay for women by the end of 1975, in line with the equal pay legislation and TUC policy objectives, will be inaddition to the  6 figure.ii8       Negotiators will be expected to offset anyimprovements in non-wage benefits against the pay figure.In this period of high unemployment, negotiators should of course continue to give priority to improving jobsecurity.8       In the current situation there may be understandablepressure for work-sharing arrangements.   To be effectivethese must take the form of a cut in actual hours worked
per employee c   They should not be.. usadU-as--a .method. .pfobtaining a disguised increase in incomes out of line with the pay limit.   Negotiators should therefore give priority to securing actual reductions&apos;in hours, and to reducingnormal hours to 40 in sectors where this has not been attained.   The 35 hour week remains a longer term objective.9 There may be isolated instances of negotiatorsexperiencing difficulties in applying or observing the pay limit, the existence of any such difficulty does not remove from negotiators and their executives the responsibility of doing all they can to ensure that the limit is observed.Where unions and employers both agree that there is aserious difficulty, they can make a joint submission to the tuc and the CBI, who will jointly examine the problem and   &apos;determine whether this should be submitted to ACAS for arbitration^,10        In this process of reducing the rate of inflation.,the more prosperous can more, easily bear the burden of helping the economy and should be prepared to take a cut in their current standards of consumption;    those withincomes over  .- 7-000 a year should forgo any increase intheir incomes in the present period of difficulties.    TheGovernment should apply this principle in the public sector.Top pay review bodies will heed to take this fully intoaccount. And unions will be looking for a definite response from executives in companies with whom they negotiate.
Pr 1   The General council welcomed the fact that thePrices Secretary reduced the profit margins of retailersin her major autumn review of the price codein the spring of 1974 and /$resisted the demands fromindustrialists that the price code should be abolished.Nevertheless the General Council are concerned that not enough is being done to control prices or win public confidence in the present system.Pr2   As the rate of inflation is brought down substaa-tially, real national income can begin to grow again,and living standards as a whole and employment can bemaintained.   For this reason the General Councilbelieve that a price target to be achieved by the middleof next year should be set.   The aim should be that the retail Price Index by Autumn 1976 will be less than 10per cent above the figure a year earlier.    This will mean that from this September onwards the figures forthe RPI increase over the past year will graduallydecline from the present level of 25 per cent to a figure of 10 per cent some time next year.    This means that the monthly rate of increase in the RPI can beexpected to fall over the period well below present rates to less than L per cent a month.Pr 3   The achievement of this target will require actionon a number of fronts.   With the combination of a lower rate of wage settlements and favourable factors such asconstant or falling import prices it is essential thatlower cost increases are reflected in lower price increasesby manufacturers and distributors.,    The Price Code involvesnot only the control of prices but the control of profit margins.
As the&apos; economy expands to-&apos;meet the expected increasein world trade and turnover increases it is essentialthat -the Price Code does not operate in such a way as:-.t.o cause a big Increase in absolute profits.Pr 4   In order to encourage compliance hw. employers, with,.thepolicy the General Council would support an amendment to the Price Code which will disallow wage increasesajopve the ,pay limit being - passed in price increases.In effect the productivity,deduction.should:be increased from 20$ to 100$ for all. increases above... the.. pay, limijp..In order not to penalise firms and sectors with belowaverage wages the pay limit for the firm should be&quot; &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;taken as equivalent to  6 times the number of workers&quot;in that firm rather than 10 per cent of&quot;the total paybill;     The Government have indicated that they may need to take measures to allow   all wage increases ,t.o..be   ...disallowed for-price purposes if firms pay above the limit.Pr 5   The-lower .rate.--of. wage increases and.:a-::fast;er.rgrowt.hin the economy..will also allow a higher level.;.of.-s- ,. .-.productivity deduction for wage increases up to  6*.   ..In the past pay round firms have had to absorb a fifth of wage increases.   As theise have been around 25 percent firms have had to absorb 5 per cent of the wage billinstead&apos;of passing it on in   prices.    Keeping the productivity deduction w :one fifth once wage increasesreach   the ten, per cent level raould mean that firms-would only have to absorb 2 per cent of the wage bill.To increase the productivity deduction to one half would maintain the figure of 5 per cent..   The.increase in the productivity deduction from one fifth,.to. one halfshould. .be seen as . a direct - way- of breaking: into, theprice and wages spiral.
Pr 6     Special measures might need to be taken to encouragecompliance by highly capital intensive firms, and amuch higher general level of productivity deductionis needed anyway for these firms.    Companies whichexport a high proportion of their products might be ableto escape the financial sanction of the 100$ productivitydeduction, though such companies will be subject to heavy international competitive pressure as world trade increases.    Extra effort will be needed from thePrice Commission to ensure that small firms inaaanufacturing and distribution who are only subjectto spot checks are not excluded from the new arrange-ments.   A number of other measures outside the PriceCode might also wish to ee considered for example the withholding of aid under the Industry Act.Pr 7     The self employed should also be covered by the flat rate approach.   All self employed people should besubject to Price Commission control over their net profit margins.    This means that the Stage 4 concession to small traders must be reversed.    In addition, andin the interests of social fairness, the self employedshould be subject to a ceiling on profit increases.The self employed should also be subject to the cutoff point of     7,(00.0 per annum.    Part of the overallapproach is that dividanfi   control should continue and the Chancellor has already imposed a 10;per centlimit on dividends, instead of the previous 12i percent limit.v.      SubsidiesPr 8   The role of subsidies needs to be examined further as
the present food subsidies have had a very markedeffect in helping the low paid and the pensioners.The benefit conferred by food subsidies isnnearlyfour times as great proportionally for the low incomehousehold as it is for the highest income group.    in helping to prevent price increases and subsequent wage increases food subsidies have more than paid for themselves.    Under current economic conditions any reduction in the level of food subsidies should -be viewed with concern as adversely affecting income distribution and cost inflation.    For these reasons the General Council will fee looking to the Governmentto rescind their decision to cut food subsidies bybetween  150 and  200 million in the coming financialyear.P&amp;*9     One vital requisite for a successful price controlpolicy is a public understanding of that policy and how it bears on everyday purchases.    The general council re&amp;ognise the efforts made by the Governmentin controlling prices, but mora needs to be done, not least mn explaining to the average shopper j&amp;hg&quot;:i3j fecesbelie y.Pr 10   In particular, an intensified effort needs to be madeat shop level, through the publication of price lists,unit prices and price range orders, which can all help the shopper.    Over the past year the TUC has beenencouraging trades councils to press their localauthorities to set up high street consumer advice centres.Trades councils have been actively pursuing this, buton many occassftaa^local authorities have replied thatthey have insufficient funds to set up such centres.
Pr 11 There are.now 60 consumer advice centres in the Highstreets of Britain.    In March 197^- there were only 5.Another 30 are due to open by the end of the year buttextra financial help from the central GoverpajW&amp;  is needed as many local authorities have shelved plans for these centres.   Only a small injection of agntralcentral Government money, perhaps  1 million, to helplocal authorities set up these centres could reapvery substantial rewards in terms of public confidence in the price control system.Pr 12   The General Council welcome the introduction of price range lists in the shops for the subsidised goods.Massive publicity is needed in the national and localmedia to tell the shopper about the valuable rmminformation to be gained from these lists, and theprice range lists themselves should be prominentlydisplayed in the shops.Pr 13   However what would be most valuable to the shopper isto have up to date information about prices in a partic-ular shopping area.    In the light of the surveys carriedout at Southend, Glasgow and Bury, the Government should now make a massive effort to establish weekly pricemonitoring in all major shopping areas of the country.Each week the prices of about JO key grocery itemstogether with prices of some- standard quantities of fresh foods should be collected by local government officials working in conjunction with local consumergroups.    The Department of Prices and Consumer Protectionshould ensure that adequate funds and manpower resources are available.    The TUC would encourage trades councils to take an active part in the survey^, and., the publication
of the resultsPr 14   The aim would be to present to the shopper theindividual prices of key goods in all the main shops ina locality together with a total showing which shopoffers the best value both for branded goods and ownbrands.   The result should be published in local papers,displayed in high street consumer advice centres, localauthority offices, post offices and libraries and other forms of publicity should be tried.   The Governmentshould also consider whether the shops themselvesshould display the comparative price information.Pr 15   In addition every pub should publish price listswhich would help to put a stop to overchargingInstances of this have been brought to light by west midlands Trading -Standards Officers.Pr 16   Unit pricing - ie, compulsory labelling of goodswith the price per unit of weight - also should be greatly extended in order to give the shopper a betteridea of value for money.Pr 17   Further measures may well be needed to bring home to people that the rate of inflation can be reduced.in.the coming year.   The Government should aim to ensurethat maximum advantage is taken of seasonal falls infresh food prices..  A special price restraint programme should, be concentrated on the key items. of particular  -importance in the expenditure of families.;   -----
Although prices charged by manufacturers are controlled,distributors are controlled by their gross percentagemargins.   The Government should take steps to ensure,possibly though agreement with manufacturers anddistributors, that the benefits of a lov^x- rate of cost increases are brought through in actual shopprices as early as possible and that the benefits are concentrated on the limited range of key products.much greater imagination is needed in the system of price control.. The Government MghtrjselieiopfcifcQ - \ -3Xoraign.experience.   In France, for example theGovernment has inspired price cuts in school require-ments in the Autumn.   Similar action in this countryand action on childrens shoes and clothing would kelp%a maintaining public confidence in the price control system. If the Government is unable to get agreement with -manufacturers and distributors, the TUC would favour a six-months gap between price inc3Pee(B.9S.Pr 18 The General Council recognise the substantial progress made by the Government in increasing rent subsidies.Total subsidies for the present financial year areforecast at  1,200 million, compared with  736 million in 1973/74 and only  500 million in 1972/73; despite the rate of inflation this represents a very sizeablereal increase.   However the Government have announcedthat housing subsidies are to be cut by  65 million in1967/77.   The General Council will be looking to theGovernment to at least maintain the:level of housing subsidies, and if possible these should fee increasednext year.   This could well be accomplished by a cut in the arms bill.
&apos;: 14EmploymentEl      On present trends the level of unemployment may soonnear the one million mark.and rise even more through thecoming winter.    If the rate of inflation can be brought down and if the economy can expand through high investment and exports, then this will have a beneficial effect onthe level of employment.    The General Council believethat the targets for pay and prices have to be related toan objective for employment.   They believe that the aim should be to secure a major reduction in the level ofunemployment   in 1976.E2      It is vital that the fastest possible progress shouldbe made in introducing the Temporary Employment Subsidy, Atpresent it is proposed that TES should only operate in theDevelopment Areas.   While recognising the problems of the   &apos;regions, it is important to realise that the problem of firms dispersing skilled work forces in the present recessionand not being able to r,ecruit them again-when-the upturn in economic activity comes is one which -.gcres^.widgot-than the Deve 1Areas.ri^nV-&quot;/&quot;     The TES should therefore be -extended.!! The&quot;, subsidywill be especially important . for    those   fixns       -who will be best able to take advantage of the upturn in world trade,    Trade unionists should play a part in theadministration of the TES.E3      There is need for monitoring the employment situatiamand the General Council will be looking to the Governmentto take appropriate action, as and when necessary,in the coming year to ensure that the aim is met. A reductionin the rate of Inflation will greatly strengthen the Govern-ment&apos;s ability to take direct action through public expenditure the level of employment arid unemployment is one of the factors which should be monitored by the TUC and government.       To ensure that a planned reversal
of the unemployment trend does in fact occur will entail ahigher target for. economic growth -.in the region of 3 per cent - as it is likely that productivity will be risingat this rate.    Nor can it be ignored that it is the rate of growth of output and productivity which will determineBritain&apos;s place in the international league table ofliving standards.   The Chancellor should therefore be pre-pared to take selective measures by the Autumn to meet thisgrowth target,e4        In line with monitoring of the employment scene atnational level there should also be monitoring at sectorlevel through EDCs, and at company level through planning agreements in which manpower planning will be a key part.E5        In a period of high unemployment the Government shouldimprove the operation of the various national insurance and supplementary benefit rules, and remove the unfairness withwhich the existing rules operate against those on short-time working.E6        The level of unemployment depends mainly on the levelof economic activity.    However, the Manpower services commission can play an important role in examining structuralunemployment problems and it should have adequate resources to meet priorities such as developing work creation schemes,in particular to relieve unemployment among young people.A number of selective measures are currently being carried outby the MSC including the expansion of the Employment ServicesAgency, the training award scheme, special assistance to theconstruction, industry, special schemes for assisting redundantapprentices, the expansion of the TOPS scheme, and new formsof training for young people.   A number..of other measures could also be quickly introduced.    These include improvedmobility allowances for the Employment Transfer Scheme,Training Contracts providing finance-for employers whose
-&apos; :&apos; &apos; ; &apos; -1 f &apos;      16       ;young workers have completed a training award, the MSC&apos;work creation scheme, which could^provide 15,000 places a year,and a selective recruitment subsidy for certain groups such asyoung workers.
Social ContractSI        Achievement of the wider objectives of the social contract will all be assisted by agreement on any effectivecounter-inflation programme.    These wider measures are, in turn, vital to the continuing support for the general conceptioni^ithin the trade union Movement.Investment, Planning Agreements and Industrial DemocracyS2        Despite the public expenditure cuts which have been announced for 1976-77 public investment is forecast to growby 2 per cent between the first half of 1975 and the first half of 1976.    On the other hand private fixed investment is forecast to decline by 4 per cent.    The continuing fall in private fixed investment underlines the urgency of the new industrial legislation which the Government is introducing.S3        The General Council hope that the fullest use will bemade of the new industrial powers presently being legislatedfor, and the negotiation of planning agreements with majorcompanies will be a priority.    In this context progress in establishing a National Planning Centre would help bringtogether trade union representatives, managers and civilservants to study the best methods of implementing planning agreements and improving the performance of British industries.The nationalisation legislation for shipbuilding, aircraft andthe BNOC should proceed as quickly as possible, and there willhe a need to extend public ownership through the not.   Majorlegislation on industrial democracy, based on trade union organisation, is a further key priority for the next year inorder to extend the concept of joint planning and control toall the levels of the economy.
S4        A policy of greater public direction of- private investment should be specifically related to the employmentobjective. In Sweden spending by the Labour Market Boardaccounts for 8 per cent of total government spendingj    in contrast in the UK spending by the MSC is just over 0.6 percent of total government spending.   However in Sweden theLabour Market Board controls the release and direction of funds in the Investment Reserve Scheme.   The TUC has already suggested in the 1975 Economic Review the adoption of a blocked investment balance system similar to that operating in Sweden.S5        A policy of greater direction of investment alsorequires greater control over the financial system.    The systemof Competition in Credit, although much modified since itsinception in September 1971j has had a deleterious effect onthe steering of funds into manufacturing industry.    BetweenNovember 1970 and May 1974 total bank advances to manufacturing industry rose by 24 per cent, but advances to finance companiesrose by 71 per cent, and advances to property companies roseby 80 per cent.S6        Greater efforts- need also to be made in controllingflows of capital overseas and in attracting inward investmentproviding that safeguards are met.    Special attention shouldbe paid in planning agreements to any plans by firms to invest overseas.Import ControlsS7        Despite-the-welcome......Improvement... in . the. balance, of  -      -payments the level of imports, particularly of sensitivemanufactures, is still causing concern.    The importation ofcertain goods such as textiles, clothing, footwear, glass,electronics...an^mojtLor^ajcs-J-s-Joaving..a^.serious effect on
employment levels in the UK.   Evidence of dumping of someof these commodities is clear and the -Government should not hesitate to act in these cases.   There is also a case for introducing more widespread import controls on manufacturedgoods as a temporary measure until the economy begins to expand again.    Imports should be covered in planning agreements and should also be one of the information disclosure provisions in the Industry Bill.Social WageS8        As part of the pay, prices and employment policy theGeneral Council will be looking for further improvements inthe social wage to meet particular needs such as extra help for the disabled, a generous level of child benefits, and educational priorities such as nursery school provision-,day release and adult education.    One of the most importantparts of the social wage is pensions.   Already the Governmenthave announced a  2.70 increase for a married couple.   TheGeneral Council will be looking for subsequent early reviewsto maintain the real level of pensions in relation to averagewhich should have a direct percentage relationship,earnings/   Defence cuts have already been announced which will help allow increases in the social wage within total public expenditure, but more should be done in this connection,whilst bearing in mind the employment implications.
IV     IMPLEMENTING THE CONTRACT1 It is not sufficient for the trade union movementat Congress to give formal endorsement to a report of thiskind,2 . - f&apos;-:Just as important as the formula itself is winningits acceptance by members and their negotiators.   There-Istherefore still a major job for everyone to do in ensuring that this understanding is disseminated to the ten milliontrade unionists.   Ultimately, the narrow wage and salaryaspects will only be seen in their perspective by the mass of trade union membership if they too have comprehendedwhat it is that the trade union movement is endeavouring to achieve.   There must be a far greater degree of association in the future between trade unionists themselves and theCongress position.    There has to be an identification and a commitment to the action to follow.3 Many trade union leaders themselves may unwittinglygive the impression that the social contract is something which concerns the Government and concerns the TUC but doesnot concern and involve them personally.   There can be nofailure of the social contract if there is an identificationby trade unionists themselves, and by all members of theGovernment as well.   iSne social contract will succeed providedthat/union members feel this sense of identification and association.   Without the understanding, support, commitmentand action on the part of trade union members, the TUC canachieve little.
Establishing a Consensus for Action4 Unions should act to secure acceptance and involvementat all stages via the normal processes of policy formulation -branch discussions, conference debates and pre-negotiationmeetings.    It is intended that this policy statement on thedevelopment of the social contract should be given thefullest possible circulation to, and discussion within, tradeunions down to branch and shop-floor level, prior to full discussion at the September Congress.    Union policies oncollective bargaining should be formulated in&apos; the light ofthis statement and of branch discussions on it.   where necessary, union executives will need to meet and review :.previous Conference decisions in the light of the newsituatipn.    The implication is not that existing unionobjectives will be removed, but that in the present periodof difficulties they will be deferred, and their attainmentphased in with the exigencies of the current situation.Joint monitoring of developments in the economic situation -output, employment, investment, prices, diTi-derSd^nan^^ay -against policy ofr^eefrjsres wiH.be carried out by the TUC, theGovernment and the CBI.    For this purpose the TUC will consider with the CBI arrangements for the collection of relevant information about pay settlements.An effective jcint publicity campaign involving the tuc, the Government and the Labour Party will be set up toget the message across to the membership on the shop floorand to the general public and secure their involvement inthese objectives.
