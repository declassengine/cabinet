PUBLIC EXPENDITURE:    RESOURCES, TAXATION AND THE PSBRThere are three main ways of considering the claims of public expenditure and of the public sector on the economy.The Public Sector&apos;s Direct Use of Resources2. Our medium-term assessments of resource &apos;use over a futureperiod of years always first set aside the estimated requirementsof the &quot;prior claims&quot; - i.e. the balance of payments and productive investment.    The reason is that unless adequate resources areavailable for these purposes, the growth and balance of the economy will be prejudiced and so therefore will be the achievement of allother objectives.    The nationalised industries also use resourcesdirectly, but in the assessments their claims are normally included with the rest of private sector investment since most of it isrequired to build up the productive infra-structure of the economy.3. Next comes the division between the direct use of resourcesby the public sector and their use to meet the claims of personal consumption.    The Central Government and the local authorities useresources directly for investment and consumption in the public services:  to build roads, hospitals, schools etc; to equip them withthe necessary plant and supplies; and to recruit the manpower to runthem.    Public expenditure devoted to the direct use of resources inthis way amounts to about 5^% of the total  (197^/75).    It is obviousthat if the public services use manpower, capital equipment orsupplies, those resources are not available either to meet the priorclaims or the requirements of personal spending.    The manpower claims of the public sector have in fact been growing very substantially inpast years (see table .attached to the Annex); and when it is suggestethat this growth must be checked, by reducing public programmes, theintention is that more real resources should be made available forother sectors of the economy.    This requires movement into exports,investment or production for personal consumption.    What we areconcerned with for this purpose is restraint or reduction of directpublic purchase of goods and services for investment or consumption;
that isj mainly construction in the case of investment, and manpower and supplies in the case of consumption.    The great bulk of this expenditure is incurred on defence, roads, and - by far the greatestpart - on programmes like health and education which contribute tothe &quot;social wage&quot;.4. The rest of the resources becoming available in the economy is available for personal consumption in one form or another.    Thegrowth of this total shows what share individual persons will have of-the total resources left over after the prior claims and the directdemands of the public services have been met.Public Expenditure on Use of Resources plus Publicly-financedPersonal Consumption ......5. Resources for personal consumption will be purchased, in part from the net-of-tax earnings of individuals; and in part from various forms of social security and other transfers.    In considering thetotal amounts spent by the public sector the transfer payments which give rise to the latter claims have to be added in.    It should benoted that at this point we have moved from considering the way in/which real resources are distributed among different uses in the economy to considering public spending.    Thus this total of public expenditure includes the cost of all transfers: grants of cash both to industry in the various forms of assistance, and to individualsthrough social security and other payments.    The cost to the government or other public authorities of subsidies to consumption are. also included.    Such subsidies reduce the cost of particular goods or services - electricity, council rents, subsidised food - and thusleave more available from pay packets for other spending.    In arriving at this particular total we are therefore splitting off the publicly-financed part of personal consumption and adding it to public expenditure on use of resources.6. Transfer payments which take the form of assistance to industry add indirectly to the demand on resources to the extent thatthey stimulate additional expenditure on investment or other companyactivity.    These effects have to be taken into account in assessing the implications of such expenditure for the balance of the economy.
7. The main macro-economic significance of these public expenditure totals is the implication for taxation.    The extent towhich taxation will have to be adjusted to keep the economy in balance with different levels and distribution of public expenditurevaries with the consequential demand effects.    Transfer paymentsvary substantially in this respect, but the large proportionrepresented by pensions and other benefits do have large demandeffects so that improvements and upratings require substantial additional taxation if balance is to be maintained.    It is true thatin widely varying degrees some transfer payments benefit the samepaople who have to pay the increased taxes; and a large part of thepopulation benefits from cheaper food or energy through subsidiessimilarly paid for, although there are redistributional effects.But there may still be reluctance to accept the additional taxation,particularly with the marginal rates now ruling, and action to offset its effects, notably by higher wage demands or lower saving,becomes a real and serious risk.    The question here is how much oftheir income people will allow the Government to spend for them andon them rather than deciding for themselves how to spend it.8. The major and crucial judgement required here is the extentto which people as a whole are prepared to accept additional taxationto pay for additional public spending, whether on the direct provisionof community services, or on benefits and assistance to persons orto industry.    The bulk of the personal transfers consist of thefollowing: -Pood subsidiesPrice support subsidies to nationalised industriesHousing subsidiesSocial security)Dependent on future price levelsDependent on future rent levels and interest ratesDependent on number of eligibleclaimants  (who are increasing) and decisions on coverage and rate ofimprovement of benefits.
9. In the last two years it has been possible to allow public expenditure to increase substantially without matching increases in taxation, partly because we have been prepared to run a large deficit on the balance of payments, and partly because of high saving and low investment expenditure by the private sector.    However, as the external deficit is eliminated, private saving returns to more normallevels, and investment recovers, there will be an increasingprobability that higher taxes will... be needed to balance the economy,even if public expenditure were to remain constant.    A fortioritaxation would have to be raised if public expenditure were to continueto increase.The Public Sector Borrowing Requirement10. Meanwhile, the high level of public expenditure is reflected in the enormous public sector borrowing requirement  (PSBR).    ThePSBR is essentially a simple concept.    It Is the difference betweenthe public sector&apos;s cash outgoings in any period for all purposes and the receipts from taxation and other public sector revenues inthe same period.    The payments therefore include all the itemsmentioned above - direct purchases of manpower and other resources;transfers of all kinds to the private sector; the net cash requirementsof the nationalised industries for all purposes; and - a form ofexpenditure not so far discussed - acquisition of existing assets,such as land or company securities (representing real assets taken over, for example, on nationalisation) for payment in cash.-11. A large PSBR poses severe problems for monetary management.Broadly speaking unless we can finance much of the borrowing require-ment at home by selling gilt-edged and other government securitiesto the public, we have to borrow more from the banks and so Increasethe money supply.    Apart from the adverse effect on the externalfinancing problem, this may threaten domestic demand management and counter-inflation policy.    The extent to which it is possible tosell debt to the non-bank public depends on confidence - which isitself strongly affected by the size of the PSBR - and the level andexpected trend of interest rates.    It may be possible to increase
MFSDENthe amount of debt we sell by raising interest rates, but thiswould have unfortunate consequences for some of our other objectives,particularly in relation to housing and industry.    The problems are much the same if private companies are acquired in the first placeby the issue of government stock rather than cash, because this willdisplace sales of other public sector debt and thus add to theproblem of financing the PSBR.12. In sum, because of the difficulties of financing the borrowing requirement and the problems of monetary management, evenpublic expenditure which has no significant demand effect may need to be restrained.13. It has hitherto been possible to finance the current verylarge borrowing requirement without adverse consequences for the moneysupply for reasons similar to those which have allowed us to raisepublic expenditure without matching increases in taxation, such asthe high level of savings, the low investment in the private sector and the size of the external deficit.    It is probable that the firstsituation will change within the next year or so, and it Is to be hoped that with rising activity in the economy the private sector&apos;demand for funds for Investment will grow substantially.    It will alsobe an object of policy that the external deficit should be reduced.Severe restraint for public expenditure is thus essential not onlyin relation to resource planning and taxation but also with referenceto monetary management.14. With reference to the present public expenditure programmes three alternative approaches discussed in this note raise thefollowing points.    The public sector&apos;s direct use of resources isestimated to grow 1974-79 at between ljj and 2 per cent per annum.This leaves only just over 1 per cent per annum for total personal consumption (privately-financed consumption plus transfers).    Ifconsumers are not content to be restricted to such a low rate of growth but the public sector insists on maintaining its claims, thebalance of trade and/or investment - ie, the &quot;prior claims&apos;  - will suffer as they have done so often in the past.    Reducing the public sector&apos;s direct claims on resources may thus be an essential- 5 -
prerequisite for sufficient resources being available for thebalance of trade and investment.15. When transfers are added to the public sector&apos;s direct useof resources  (see para.  5 above) the resulting total grows at just under 2 per cent 197^-79, and privately-financed consumption -resources available for people to buy out of their own incomes -grows at between jj and 1 per cent per annum, ie, even less thantotal personal consumption.    The consequences come through on the tax side; on the assumption that income tax allowances are up-ratedin line with prices, and that indirect taxes are, where necessary,similarly raised with inflation, the increase in income tax ratesmight be 9-ll pence.    The basic rate of income tax, which is now-paid by people with quite modest earnings, would thus be 41\-&apos;l6 pence;taking account of graduated national insurance contributions, this implies a State-take of the order of 50 pence on every pound earnedby the broad mass of wage earners once their tax allowances areexhausted.16. When we are considering the borrowing requirement it is/the &quot;cash total&quot; of public expenditure, without regard to demandeffects etc, which matters.    As explained above, the borrowing requirement is likely to continue to present serious problems forsome years to come, and this emphasises the importance of containing the total growth of public expenditure in &quot;cash terms&quot; also, includingacquisitions.- 6 -
PiUTi AANNEXManpower:    1951/1981The problem of the extent to which manpower is being drawn into the public  services is brought out  in theattached table.     The table shows,   in millions of membersof the labour force,   the total increments in successiveperiods since 1951 to 198l,   and the gains and losses inthe four main sectors of the economy,  manufacturing,private services,   public corporations and publicoeiyj-Ces.       xne   iilOat   o ox xiyxjx^,   leatui ea   ux me   cauxt:   aitthat -a) From 1966 onwards it is only in services  thatmanpower is  shown as increasing.b) Between 1966  and 1973 the total labour force actuallydeclined by 0.1 million,  while employment in thepublic  services increased by 0,8 million,c) Between 1971  and .1981,   on forecasts published by theDepartment of Employment,   the total labour force would increase by 1.1 million,   but the whole of this and a littlemore -  1.2 million in all - would find their way into thepublic  services.
