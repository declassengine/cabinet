RACIAL DISCRIMINATIONINTRODUCTION1. A decade has elapsed since the introduction of the first race relationsstatute in this country. The time has come to evaluate the working of thelegislation. In carrying out this review, the Government has been greatlyassisted by the information provided by the Race Relations Board, the Com-munity Relations Commission, the Runnymede Trust, Political and economic planning, organisations within the minority communities, voluntary bodiesdealing with different aspects of race and community relations, and individualexperts.2. The Government wishes to make a special acknowledgement to theSelect Committee of the House of Commons on Race Relations and Immigrationwhich has, since 1968, conducted a number of enquiries and produced a seriesof detailed reports and recommendations on some of the major aspects of race relations and immigration (education, employment, housing, police/immigrantrelations, the problems of coloured school-leavers and the control of Common-wealth immigration). In particular, the most recent report of the Select Com-mittee on the organisation of race relations administration, published on21 July 1975, has made a number of important and far-reaching recommenda-tions about the role of central and local government and related matters. TheGovernment has taken note of those recommendations of the Select Committeewhich affect the proposals it is now putting forward. The Government willmake a considered response to Parliament to these and the many other widerrecommendations in the Report as soon as possible.3. Immigration and race relations have been closely linked in the public mind in the past decade and a half. The source of much of the confusion andanxiety which has surrounded these questions is the absence in our nationalitylaw of any clear and positive concept of citizenship. Largely for historicalreasons derived from our imperial past, there is no coherent definition of whois and who is not a citizen of this country; and distinctions made in our citizen-ship laws have been employed for the quite different purpose of controllingimmigration. One consequence has been the widespread if mistaken criticism of successive Governments both for being racially discriminatory in theirimmigration control policies and also for failing to exercise effective controlover immigration. The Government is undertaking a comprehensive reviewof the law of citizenship. The aim is to reform our citizenship laws in such a way as to enable the control of future immigration to be seen to be effective, to beflexible and to be free from any racial discrimination. The hope is that it will then be possible to bring to an end the acrimony, controversy and uncertaintywhich have hampered our capacity as a society to deal with the problems of race relations.4. Much has changed in the ten years since the introduction of the firststatute on race relations, both in the character of race relations and in thegeneral understanding of the issues and problems involved. Ten years ago thiscountry was still receiving substantial numbers of immigrants from the new commonwealth. In 1964, the year preceding the first Race Relations Act, nearly
53,000 people from the new Commonwealth entered this country for settlement,of whom over a quarter were holders of employment vouchers who were entitled to bring in their dependants for settlement. In 1974 22,000 people wereadmitted for settlement from these countries. The overwhelming majority ofthese were either United Kingdom passport holders to whom we have aspecial commitment or dependants of people already settled here. In the sameyear 2,200 holders of work permits were admitted (for temporary residence)from the new Commonwealth. Finally, and of great significance to the subjectof this White Paper, the character of the coloured population resident in thiscountry has changed dramatically over the decade. Ten years ago, less than a quarter of the coloured population had been born here: more than three out ofevery four coloured persons then were immigrants to this country, a substantial number of them fairly recent arrivals. About two out of every five of the coloured people in this country now were born here and the time is not far off when themajority of the coloured population will be British born. The governments proposals are based on a clear recognition of the proposition that the over-whelming majority of the coloured population is here to stay, that a substantial and increasing proportion of that population belongs to this country, and thatthe time has come for a determined effort by Government, by industry and unions, and by ordinary men and women, to ensure fair and equal treatment forall our people, regardless of their race, colour, or national origins. racial discrimination, and the remediable disadvantages experienced by sections of thecommunity because of their colour or ethnic origins are not only morallyunacceptable, not only individual injustices for which there must be remedies,but also a form of economic and social waste which we as a society cannot afford.5. Immigrants from the coloured Commonwealth came to Britain in thefirst instance in search of work, and their settlement patterns reflect this fact.About two-thirds of all coloured immigrants live in the six major conurbations,the great majority of them in the two main centres of coloured settlement Greater London and the West Midlands.6. There is clear evidence that, within these major areas of settlement, anexcessively high proportion of coloured people live in the relatively more deprivedinner city areas. In other words, these areas of housing stress are disproportionate-tionately coloured.7. The pattern of unemployment is not uniform over all coloured groups.The 1971 Census suggests that young West Indians suffer from unemploymentwith exceptional severity. There are indications that coloured women, althoughless likely to be at work than white women, are far more likely to be in full-timework when they do go out to work. They are more heavily concentrated inthe lower socio-economic groups. The proportion of coloured women withdependent children who are working full time is much higher than that of white women, and far higher proportions work longer hours than do whitewomen. Moreover, as the most recent Political and Economic Planninginvestigation of the Extent of Racial Discrimination has shown, despite the race Relations Acts, substantial discrimination continues to occur at work.Political and Economic Planning estimated that a coloured unskilled workerhas a one in two chance of being discriminated against when applying for a job,a coloured skilled worker a one in five chance, and a coloured white-collarworker a one in three chance.
8. The latest figures suggest that the housing conditions of the colouredpopulation have hardly improved in the last ten or fifteen years. The proportionof them who live in overcrowded conditions or who are forced to share the basic amenities is higher than that for the population at large. Coloured people are grossly over-represented in the private furnished rented sector, whereconditions are worst and insecurity greatest, and significantly under-represented in the council housing sector.9. Not all the evidence is as grim and discouraging as the preceding para-graphs may suggest. Nearly half the coloured households own their houses almost exactly the same proportion as white households. In Greater London,where concern has been expressed about the concentration of black workers indirty and menial jobs, there is evidence that a substantial proportion of WestIndians are in skilled manual employment. The proportion of young Asiansout of work has been lower than that of young people in general. It isimportant not to lend credence to unrelieved pessimism and prophecies of doom,and particularly important not constantly to associate the coloured populationwith &quot;problems&quot;. It nonetheless remains the case that the condition of thecoloured population in the mid-1970s gives cause for concern.10. It was not unreasonable in the early 1960s to expect that many of thedifficulties experienced by the coloured population stemmed from the fact thatthey were recent arrivals in this country and that, with the passage of time,greater familiarity on their part and greater acceptance on the part of the indigenous population, some at least of these difficulties would diminish ordisappear. The emerging evidence suggests that that early optimism may not bejustified, that the problems with which we have to deal if we are to see genuineequality of Opportunity for the coloured youngsters born and educated in thiscountry may be larger in scale and more complex than had been initiallysupposed.11. The possibility has to be faced that there is at work in this country, as elsewhere in the world, the familiar cycle of cumulative disadvantage by whichrelatively low-paid or low-status jobs for the first generation of immigrants gohand in hand with poor and overcrowded living conditions and a depressedenvironment. If, for example, job opportunities, educational facilities, housing and environmental conditions are all poor, the next generation will grow upless well-equipped to deal with the difficulties facing them. The wheel thencomes full circle, as the second generation find themselves trapped in poorjobs and poor housing. If, at each stage of this process, an element of racial discrimination enters in, then an entire group of people are launched on avicious downward spiral of deprivation. They may share each of the disadvantageswith some other deprived group in society; but few other groups in societydisplay all their accumulated disadvantages.12. The Government is bound to take that prospect seriously, although itcannot be said too often that there is not as yet sufficient evidence to demonstratebeyond argument that this is what is actually happening. It would clearly beirresponsible to wait for more conclusive evidence of deteriorating race relations and entrenched racial inequality. It is the Governments duty to prevent thesemorally unacceptable and socially divisive inequalities from hardening intoentrenched patterns. It is inconceivable that Britain, in the last quarter of the
20th century, should confess herself unable to secure for a small minority of around a million and a half coloured citizens their full and equal rights asindividual men and women.13. The Government is convinced, as a result of its review of race relationsgenerally and of the working of the legislation, that a fuller strategy to dealwith racial disadvantage will have to be deployed than has been attempted sofar. The complexity of the problem demands a commensurate degree of care inthe approaches adopted. There still remain a set of problems which arisebecause we are dealing with newcomers. It is not to be assumed that these problems will disappear without residue simply with the passage of time, forsome of the problems which coloured immigrants faced as immigrants, forexample linguistic problems, have created handicaps for the second generation(West Indian as well as Asian) which will continue to require attention and resources for some time to come. Beyond the problems of cultural alien-ness,there are the problems of low status, of material and environmental deprivationwhich coloured immigrants and, increasingly, their children experience. To theextent that they share all or some of these problems with other groups in society,a general attack on deprivation will be relevant to their problems. But theremay be a special dimension to their problems to the extent that the factor of racial discrimination multiplies and accentuates the disadvantages which areshared in part with others. Finally, the problems of racial disadvantage canbe seen to occur typically in the context of an urban problem whose nature isonly imperfectly understood. There is no modern industrial society which hasnot experienced a similar difficulty. None has so far succeeded in resolving it.14. The review of race relations undertaken in the past year has convinced the Government that if urgent action is necessary, it is even more necessary to devise policies which are coherent rather than spectacular, to set targets whichare relevant and realisable rather than dramatic. The gravity of the prospectdemands action, but it places a premium on carefully considered action,consistently carried through. Nothing at this juncture could be worse than boldpromises without the means of implementation.15. The Government has a special responsibility as an employer. Anunequivocal statement of the Governments equal opportunity policy has beenmade to all Departments covering all grades and positions in both the industrial and the non-industrial Civil Service. The policy states, with the full support ofstaff representatives, that there will be no discrimination against any personeligible under the nationality rules whether in recruitment, training or promotionor in any other way, on the grounds of colour, race, ethnic or national origins.16. The responsibility for implementing the policy has been clearly laid on the Principal Establishment Officer of each Department. Personnel officersand line managers are responsible to their Principal Establishment Officer for ensuring that the policy is known to all staff.17. Departments have been warned to be on their guard against any uncon-consious discrimination, including preconceptions and prejudices in such areas asthe allocation of work and the assessment of managerial potential. They havealso been advised that special training (for instance in communication and under-standing the Civil Service system) may be desirable to enable staff to realisetheir full potential in the Civil Service.
18. While there is no evidence, either from complaints to the Race relations board or departmental managements, that the policy is not working satisfactorily,and no indication that ethnic minorities consider they are being discriminatedagainst, the Government considers that a vital ingredient of an equal oppor-tunities policy is a regular system of monitoring.19. Since 1969 all Government contracts have contained a standard clauserequiring contractors in the United Kingdom to conform to the provisions ofthe Race Relations Act 1968 relating to discrimination in employment and totake all reasonable steps to ensure that their employees and sub-contractorsdo the same.20. It would be the intention of the Government when new legislation aboutracial discrimination is enacted to require a similar undertaking to complywith its provisions as a standard condition of Government contracts. TheGovernment has considered whether its duty to take an active role to eliminatediscrimination requires something additional. It would be an unacceptableburden to require all contractors to supply as a matter of form full particulars of their employment policies; but the Government cannot passively assume that a formal condition in a contract is all that is required. It is thereforeintended that it should be a standard condition of Government contracts thatthe contractor will provide on request to the Department of Employment such information about its employment policies and practices as the Departmentmay reasonably require.21. It is apparent that good race relations require a coherent and co-ordinatedpolicy over a large field involving many Government Departments, localauthorities, the existing and future statutory bodies concerned with the subject and, indeed, many individuals in positions of responsibility or influence. Inorder to bring all these activities together more effectively the government proposes to set up a Standing Advisory Council under the chairmanship of theHome Secretary to advise him on all aspects of the development and implement a-tion of race relations policies. Membership would include Ministers of the, other government Departments concerned, the chairmen of the Community relations commission and the Race Relations Board (and subsequently the chairman ofthe proposed Race Relations Commission see paragraph 49 below). Thelocal authority associations, the Confederation of British Industry and theTrades Union Congress will be invited to take part, as will members of the minority communities.22. The Government has decided that the first priority in fashioning acoherent and long-term strategy to deal with the interlocking problems of immigration, cultural differences, racial disadvantage and discrimination isto give more substantial effect to what it has already undertaken to do: tostrengthen the law already on the statute book. This involves an examinationof the institutions already in existence to consider what changes may benecessary to enable them to operate with greater effectiveness.23. Legislation is the essential pre-condition for an effective policy to combatthe problems experienced by the coloured minority groups and to promoteequality of opportunity and treatment. It is a necessary pre-condition fordealing with explicit I discriminatory actions or accumulated disadvantages.Where unfair discrimination is involved, the necessity of a legal remedy is
now generally accepted. To fail to provide a remedy against an injustice strikesat the rule of law. To abandon a whole group of people in society without legalredress against unfair discrimination is to leave them with no option but to find their own redress. It is no longer necessary to recite the immense damage,material as well as moral, which ensues when a minority loses faith in the capacity of social institutions to be impartial and fair.24. The relevance of legislation to the less clear-cut, more complex situationsof accumulated disadvantages and of the effects of past discrimination may beless direct but is nonetheless real. It is a characteristic of areas of deprivationthat such resources as are available are unequally distributed. Merely to increasethe scale of resources has, by itself, no effect on the unequal, and frequentlyinequitable, allocation of the increased resources. Indeed, such a policy may,by increasing the differentials, exacerbate the very problems it was intended to solve. An effective strategy to deal with the problems of deprivation anddisadvantage must of necessity, therefore, attend both to the scale of resourcesrequired and to the equitable allocation of the increased resources. Racialdisadvantage most often occurs in contexts of generalised disadvantage and cannot be realistically dealt with unless there are mechanisms for correctingthe maldistribution of resources.25. Legislation is capable of dealing not only with discriminatory acts but with patterns of discrimination, particularly with patterns which, because of theeffects of past discrimination, may not any longer involve explicit acts of discrimination. Legislation, however, is not, and can never be, a sufficientcondition for effective progress towards equality of opportunity. A wide range of administrative and voluntary measures are needed to give practical effect tothe objectives of the law. But the legislative framework must be right. It mustbe comprehensive in its scope, and its enforcement provisions must not only be capable of providing redress for the victim of individual injustice but also ofdetecting and eliminating unfair discriminatory practices. The Governmentsfirst priority in the field of race relations must be to provide such a legislativeframework. What is more, it is uniquely a responsibility which only theGovernment can discharge. At the same time Government fully recognises thatthis is only a part of the subject; that the policies and attitudes of central andlocal government are of critical importance in themselves and in their potentialinfluence on the country as a whole.26. The Government recognises that what is here proposed for a furtherattack on discrimination will need to be supplemented by a more comprehensivestrategy for dealing with the related and at least equally important problemof disadvantage. Such a strategy has major public expenditure implications,including a reassessment of priorities within existing programmes. It cannotbe settled in advance of the outcome of the current major public expenditurereview. The Government does not, however, consider this an argument fordeferring the preparation of longer-term policies or for delaying the publication and implementation of its anti-discrimination proposals.27. The following sections of this White Paper describe the existing race relations legislation and the Governments proposals to make its scope more comprehensive and its enforcement more effective.
EXISTING LEGISLATION28. The Race Relations Act 1965 made it unlawful to discriminate on racialgrounds in specified places of public resort. It also contained provisions dealingwith racial restrictions on the transfer of tenancies and penalising incitement to racial hatred. The 1965 Act created a Race Relations Board and a network of local conciliation committees which were to investigate complaints andattempt, where appropriate, to settle any difference between the parties and obtain a satisfactory assurance against any further unlawful discrimination.Where this process of conciliation was unsuccessful, the Attorney General (or,in Scotland, the Lord Advocate) had the sole right to determine whether tobring civil proceedings.29. The Race Relations Act 1968 repealed and replaced the provisions ofthe 1965 Act dealing with discrimination in places of public resort. It extendedthe scope of the law so that it now applies to a wide range of situations inemployment, housing, the provision of goods, facilities and services to thepublic, and the publication or display of discriminatory advertisements ornotices. The 1968 Act also reconstituted the Race Relations Board, increasingboth its membership and its functions. The Board and its nine regional concilia-tion committees have a duty to investigate all complaints of unlawful discrimina-tion, except for (a) employment complaints, which must be dealt with, where appropriate, by suitable industrial machinery approved by the Secretary ofState for Employment, and (b) complaints about dismissals on racial grounds,which are dealt with by industrial tribunals in the same way as unfair dismissalsgenerally. The Board is also able to investigate a matter where it has reason tosuspect that a person has been unlawfully discriminated against even though ithas not received a complaint. Where the Board or a conciliation committeeforms an opinion of unlawful discrimination, it attempts to secure a settlement and/or an appropriate assurance, as the case may be. Where the process of conciliation fails, the Board has the exclusive right to bring legal proceedings in which it may claim a declaration, damages on behalf of the victim of unlawfuldiscrimination, and an injunction restraining any further unlawful conduct.30. The 1968 Act also created the Community Relations Commission to complement the work of the Race Relations Board. The Commission^ taskis to promote &quot;harmonious community relations&quot;, to co-ordinate nationalaction to this end, and to advise the Home Secretary on any relevant matters.Its headquarters organisation includes administrative, information and specialiststaff, and a &quot;reference division&quot; to inquire into matters referred to the Corn-mission by the Home Secretary or which the Commission considers should bebrought to his attention. The salaries of local community relations officers are paid by the Commission. The 85 local voluntary community relations councils,to which individual community relations officers are responsible, work moreor less independently of the Commission. However, apart from financial support from the centre, the Commission offers a service of co-ordination of activities,and access to advice and information, through its Regional DevelopmentOfficers. The Commission has limited funds to support locally based voluntarycommunity projects. Its training section arranges a training programme for community relations: officers and voluntary members of community relationscouncils.
31. It is not possible to provide a quantifiable measure of the practicalimpact of the 1968 Act. Generally, the law has had an important declaratoryeffect and has given support to those who do not wish to discriminate but whowould otherwise feel compelled to do so by social pressure. It has also madecrude, overt forms of racial discrimination much less common. Discriminatoryadvertisements and notices have virtually disappeared both from the press and from public advertisement boards. Discriminatory conditions have largelydisappeared from the rules governing insurance and other financial matters,and they are being removed from tenancy agreements. It is less common for an employer to refuse to accept any coloured workers and there has been somemovement of coloured workers into more desirable jobs.32. The two statutory bodies the Race Relations Board and the community relations Commission have been valuable sources of information, advice and constructive criticism. The Board has sought to achieve the aims of thelegislation not only by investigating individual cases involving alleged violations of the law but also by preventive work of an educational and advisory kind.The Commission has maintained direct liaison with the local community relations councils and with other voluntary groups and immigrant organisationsthroughout the country. It has attempted to identify the needs of racial minoritygroups and to propose how they should be met; to press the Government andother institutions to meet these needs; and to develop techniques for assessing the development of community relations.33. The effort has been considerable and the achievements have been real.And yet, at the end of the decade, both statutory bodies have forcefully drawn attention to the inability of the legislation to deal with widespread patterns of discrimination, especially in employment and housing, a lack of confidenceamong minority groups in the effectiveness of the law, and a lack of credibilityin the efficacy of the work of the Race Relations Board and the community relations Commission themselves. The continuing unequal status of Britain&apos;sracial minorities and the extent of the disadvantage from which they sufferprovide ample evidence of the inadequacy of existing policies.34. Within the limits of what can be accomplished by legislation the Boardand the Commission have been hampered in their work by weaknesses whichhave become apparent over recent years in the legal framework within whichthey have had to operate.35. One important weakness in the existing legislation is the narrowness ofthe definition of unlawful discrimination upon which it is based: the less favourable treatment of one person than of another on the ground of colour,race or ethnic or national origins. What matters under this definition is thereason or reasons for the discrimination. An unlawful motive may be inferredfrom the fact that a black person is treated less favourably than a white person;but, in the absence of a discriminatory motive, the present law does not coverpractices and procedures which have a discriminatory effect upon members of aracial minority and which are not justifiable. While it is right that motive shouldbe relevant in determining whether an alleged discriminator should compensatehis victim, it is insufficient for the law to deal only with overt discrimination.It should also prohibit practices which are fair in a formal sense but discrimina-tory in their operation and effect. For example, employers and trade unionsshould be required to dismantle unjustifiable barriers to employment oppor-
tunities when the barriers operate to discriminate against racial minorities.Such barriers are against the public interest irrespective of motive and whetheror not they operate against an identifiable individual victim.36. The 1968 Act gives undue emphasis both to motive and to the identification-tion of individual victims. Its enforcement depends excessively upon the making and processing of individual complaints. As the Race Relations Board hasobserved, complaints are random in their incidence and significance. Mostvictims do not complain. Many do not know that they have suffered discrimina-tion. Others are reluctant to complain because they do not want to relive thehumiliation which they have suffered, or because they have no confidence inthe effectiveness of the complaints procedure and the redress which it is likelyto provide for them. Some complaints are trivial; others are misconceived.Although it is necessary for the law to provide effective remedies for theindividual victim, it is also essential that the application of the law should not depend upon the making of an individual complaint.37. The role of the Race Relations Board has been circumscribed by thenarrowness of the definition of unlawful discrimination and by the complaints-based system of enforcement embodied in the 1968 Act. It has been hampered by its obligation to investigate every complaint, and by its dependence uponreceiving significant complaints, in pursuing the crucial strategic role of identify-ing and dealing with discriminatory practices and encouraging positive actionto secure equal opportunity.38. The strategic role of the Race Relations Board has also been restricted by the inadequacy of its powers to investigate and to deal with suspecteddiscriminatory practices. It is unable to compel the attendance of witnesses,or the production of documents or other information for the purposes of an investigation. In the absence of such a power, the Board has to rely uponinformation provided by an individual complainant or other witnesses and the voluntary co-operation of those against whom complaints have been made.Moreover, where the Board forms an opinion of unlawful discrimination, its scope for action is confined to attempting to secure a settlement or satisfactorywritten assurance, through the process of conciliation, and, where conciliationfails, to bringing legal proceedings. It has no power to require unlawful dis-crimination to be brought to an end, and the discriminator has no obligation tosatisfy the Board that he has altered his conduct so as to comply with the law.In these circumstances the Board may be placed in the invidious position of having to choose between accepting an inadequate settlement or an ambiguousassurance or trying to uncover further evidence in legal proceedings. To do theformer would be to damage its credibility with both parties; to do the latter would be to risk criticism for abuse of legal process. In neither case is the Boardwell placed effectively to change a discriminatory practice or to encouragepositive action to secure equal opportunity.39. The individual complainant enjoys some definite advantages under thepresent system. He is entitled to have his complaint investigated by conciliationofficers and committees possessing special skills and experience. In forming an opinion as to whether there has been unlawful discrimination, the race relations Board or conciliation committees do not require adherence to formalrules of evidence or procedure. They may form an opinion favourable to the
complainant on the basis of less weighty evidence than would be needed toestablish a prima facie case in legal proceedings. Unless conciliation fails andthe Board brings legal proceedings, the matter is dealt with without the possibleembarrassment of publicity.40. However, the requirement that all complaints should be investigated inthis way may create resentment and hostility among those it is designed to assist.The process may seem cumbersome and protracted. The complainant may feelaggrieved at being denied the right to seek legal redress while his complaint isbeing processed. If his complaint is not upheld, he is likely to resent the factthat he is denied direct access to legal remedies. Even if it is upheld, he may feelaggrieved because, in his view, the Board or conciliation committee has accepted a settlement or assurance which he regards as inadequate; or, worse still,because after conciliation has failed, the Board has decided not to bring legal proceedings, whether because it considered that it had insufficient prospects ofproving the case in court or for some other reason.41. Thus the requirement that all complaints should be investigated by the race Relations Board or its conciliation committees and that the alleged victimof racial discrimination (unlike the victims of almost all civil wrongs) should be denied direct access to legal remedies suffers from a double disadvantage. Itdistracts the statutory agency from playing its crucial strategic role whilstleaving many complainants dissatisfied with what has been done on their behalfby means of procedures which may seem cumbersome, ineffective or undulypaternalistic.42. Financial compensation is rarely an adequate remedy for the victim ofthe worst examples of racial discrimination, because money cannot compensatehim for the indignity, humiliation and distress which he suffers from be ingtreated as inferior on racial grounds. Nevertheless, the award of compensationought to be able to take into account any injury to feelings as it does for other civil wrongs. The damages which can be awarded under the 1968 Act are confined to special damages and damages for loss of opportunity. The sumsawarded have been very small and are reflected in the sums obtained as settle-ments by the Board and the conciliation committees: in 1974, the amountsranged from  2 to  150, the median settlement being  23.50.43. The courts&apos; powers to grant injunctions are also artificially and un-necessarily restricted under the 1968 Act. The Board must prove not only thatthe defendant has acted unlawfully and that he is likely, unless restrained, to doso again; it must also prove that he has previously engaged in conduct of thesame kind or a similar kind. So, if an employer were to refuse, for example,to give a job to someone on racial grounds and made clear that he intended tocontinue to discriminate unlawfully with respect of any future vacancies, theBoard would be unable to obtain an injunction unless it could establish that hehad discriminated unlawfully twice in the past- once in respect of the actcomplained of in the proceedings and once previously. This restriction uponthe courts&apos; normal power to grant injunctions is not justifiable.44. Apart from these weaknesses in the enforcement provisions of the 1968Act, there are loopholes and anomalies in the provisions defining the scope ofthe legislation which will be described later in this White Paper.
45. Finally, there are deficiencies in the terms of reference of the two statutorybodies created by the 1968 Act. Reference has already been made to the excessiveconcentration of the Race Relations Board&apos;s work upon the investigation and conciliation of individual complaints. The broader strategic role and the powersnecessary for the performance of such a role are absent from the present legis-lation. The Board does preventive work of an educational and advisory natureso as to promote racial equality generally. But to some extent there is duplicationbetween this work and some of the activities of the Community relations commission.46. Unlike the Race Relations Board which has fairly precise functions theCommunity Relations Commission labours under the disadvantage that it haslargely had to provide its own terms of reference. It has therefore been handi-capped by an uncertainty of aim since its inception and by the overlap betweenits work and that of the Board.47. Thanks to the dedicated service of the members and staff of both bodies,they have made an important contribution towards better community and race relations in spite of major structural weaknesses in the legislation. However, theGovernment accepts the views of the Race Relations Board and the community relations Commission that the existing legislation is in urgent need of reform.It has therefore decided to repeal the Race Relations Acts 1965 and 1968 andto replace them with a comprehensive measure..   A NEW STATUTE48. In its White Paper, &quot;Equality for Women&quot; (Cmnd. 5724), the Governmentindicated that, in preparing proposals for sex discrimination legislation, it had attempted to avoid a number of weaknesses which experience had revealed inthe enforcement provisions of the race relations legislation. The White Paperalso stated that it was the Governments ultimate aim &quot;to harmonise thepowers and procedures for dealing with sex and race discrimination so as tosecure genuine equality of opportunity in both fields.&quot; The new legislation will be designed to fulfil that aim.49. The Government proposes to replace the Race Relations Board and theCommunity Relations Commission by a new public body, which for the pur-poses of this White Paper will be referred to as the Race Relations Commission,although the Government has noted the recommendation of the Select Com-mittee that it should be called the &quot;Equal Rights Commission&quot;. The commission will have similar functions and powers to those conferred upon the EqualOpportunities Commission by the Sex Discrimination Bill.50. Except for good reason, the two statutes and the procedures for their administration and enforcement will be framed in similar terms. It is hoped inthis way to ensure wider public understanding of the meaning and effect of thelegislation in both fields. As recommended by the Select Committee, the race relations Commission and the Equal Opportunities Commission will be encouraged to co-operate closely and to exchange relevant information and experience so as to strengthen their respective roles. The principal functionsof the Race Relations Commission will be to work towards the elimination of
racial discrimination and the promotion of racial equality. It will have a majorstrategic role in enforcing the law in the public interest. Although it will be ableto assist and represent individuals in appropriate cases the Commission^ maintask will be wider policy: to identify and deal with discriminatory practices byindustries, firms or institutions. It will be empowered to issue non-discriminationnotices (see paragraph 112) and to bring legal proceedings against those whopersistently violate the law. It will also be able to conduct general inquiries and research, to advise Government, and to take action to educate and persuadepublic opinion. The Commission will have adequate powers to require theproduction of relevant information. It will be able not only to investigatesuspected unlawful conduct but also to keep under review wider policies and practices in the public and private sectors, having particular regard to their implications for and effect upon racial minorities.51. The Commission will thus have greater powers and wider responsibilitiesthan either the Race Relations Board or the Community Relations Commission,which it will replace. However, some of the functions now performed by thosebodies will not be undertaken by the Commission. It will not have the race relations Board&apos;s present obligation to investigate every individual complaintand to attempt to obtain settlements and assurances by means of conciliation:nor will it have the Board&apos;s exclusive right to bring legal proceedings, because there will be a right of individual access to legal redress in the industrial tribunals and county courts. For the reasons set out in paragraphs 40 and 41 above, theGovernment considers that the disadvantages of the present system outweighany advantages to the individual complainant. Moreover, it has been unable toaccept the suggestion in the Race Relations Board&apos;s most recent annual reportthat these disadvantages might be mitigated within the existing framework by giving &quot;subpoena&quot; powers to the Board for the purpose of investigating individualcomplaints. The Commission^ powers (like those of the Equal OpportunitiesCommission under the Sex Discrimination Bill) must necessarily be confined toinvestigations conducted in the public interest rather than in the interests of a potential plaintiff. When it acts on behalf of an alleged victim, the enforcementbody cannot have any greater legal powers than are enjoyed by the individualhimself. The Government has therefore decided that the complainants interestswill be better served by allowing him direct access to legal redress, helped by thespecial procedure described in paragraph 85 below for questioning the respondentabout the reasons for his conduct, and able, where the Commission thinks fit,to obtain the wide range of assistance described in paragraph 87 below. TheGovernment has taken note of the Select Committee&apos;s recommendation thatComplaints Boards should be appointed by the Commission to assist its regionalstaff in dealing with enforcement matters.52. The Government has received a number of recommendations as towhether the new Race Relations Commission should be, as the community relations Commission now is, the source of financial support, training andco-ordination for local community relations work. These recommendationshave come from the Select Committee, the Race Relations Board, the Com-munity Relations Commission and from various non-statutory and voluntary organisations. They show a wide divergence of opinion. The Government is convinced of the need to ensure that any new arrangement does nothing tohinder the valuable work being done by the community relations councils andtheir officers at the local level; indeed it would like to propose arrangements^
which would enable the local work not only to continue but to gain in its effective-ness. However, in view of the very wide differences of opinion on how thisgenerally agreed end can best be attained, the Government is undertaking full consultation with those concerned before reaching a view on what the formalrelationship between the new central statutory authority and local community relations effort should be.53. The remainder of this part of the White Paper describes in greater detail the Government^ proposals both as regards the scope and enforcement of thenew Race Relations Act.THE SCOPE OF THE LEGISLATIONDefinition of Unlawful Discrimination54. For the purposes of the Race Relations Act 1968 a person discriminatesunlawfully against another if &quot;on the ground of colour, race or ethnic or national origins&quot; he treats that other, in any relevant situation, less favourablythan he treats or would treat other persons. For the avoidance of doubt the1968 Act specifically provides that racial segregation constitutes unlawfuldiscrimination.55. The new Bill will contain a similar definition. In addition, for the reasons give in paragraph 35 above, it will be unlawful to apply a requirement orcondition which (irrespective of motive) is such that the proportion of persons of a particular colour, race or ethnic or national origins able to comply with it is considerably smaller than the proportion of other persons able to do so, andwhich is not justifiable on non-racial grounds. This will, for example, cover thesituation where an employer requires applicants to pass an educational testbefore obtaining employment if (a) the test operates to disqualify colouredapplicants at a substantially higher rate than white applicants and (b) it cannotbe shown to be significantly related to job performance. The employer will berequired to stop using such a test. However, he will not be liable to compensatea victim if he can show that the requirement or condition in question was notapplied with the intention of treating the claimant unfavourably on racial grounds.The provision will similarly apply to requirements concerning the clothing wornby employees (e.g. preventing the wearing of turbans or saris) or their minimumheight, where such requirements cannot be shown to be justifiable. It will alsobe unlawful to apply a requirement or condition which results or would belikely to result in an act of discrimination as defined above, irrespective of whether the requirement or condition is actually applied to a particular victim.In such a case, however, proceedings will be brought only by the Race relations commission. This will, for example, cover the situation where an employeroperates recruiting arrangements which result in there being no colouredapplicants for job vacancies and thus no act of discrimination against any individual victim. In such a case the Commission will be empowered to issue anon-discrimination notice requiring the employer to cease operating thearrangements, and, in the event of persistent discrimination, to apply for an injunction restraining him from operating them.56. In Ealing London Borough Council v. Race Relations Board (1972)AC 342, the House of Lords decided that the word &quot;national&quot; in the referenceto &quot;national origins&quot; in section 1(1) of the 1968 Act means national in the sense of race and not nationality or citizenship. Accordingly, the local housing
authority had not acted unlawfully on the ground of national origins in adopting a rule that the waiting list for housing accommodation should be restricted tothose who were British subjects within the meaning of the British nationality act 1948. The resulting gap in the legislation has created some anomalies and difficulties. For example, it is not unlawful to discriminate against someonebecause he is an Indian national but it is unlawful to discriminate against himbecause he is of Indian national origins (i.e. of Indian descent). It is contraryto the Treaty of Rome to discriminate against an e.c. worker or his familyon the basis of nationality. It is unclear to what extent the courts would regard a person&apos;s place of birth as constituting his national origins. Moreover, the distinction between nationality and national origins creates an obvious pretext for discriminating on racial grounds. The Government has decided to widen the definition of unlawful discrimination on the ground of national originsto include nationality and citizenship. There will be appropriate exceptionswhere a person&apos;s nationality or citizenship is a justifiable ground for considera-tion. In this way, the obligations of the Treaty of Rome in relation to EECworkers and their families will be expressly incorporated into the law of GreatBritain and will be extended for the benefit of all aliens and commonwealth citizens in this country.57. It follows from the principle of non-discrimination that it will remainunlawful to practice &quot;reverse discrimination&quot;; that is, to discriminate in favourof a racial minority. However, if the principle of non-discrimination is inter-preted too literally and inflexibly it may actually impede the elimination ofinvidious discrimination and the encouragement of equal opportunity. Unlessthe legislation makes appropriate provision, it would, for example, be unlawfulto provide special training courses for qualified coloured immigrant workersdesigned to enable them to compete on genuinely equal terms with others forwork from which they have hitherto been excluded. It would also be unlawfulfor an employer to seek actively to encourage qualified coloured immigrants toapply for employment which, for whatever reason, they have not previouslysought. The Government considers that it would be wrong to adhere so blindlyto the principle of formal legal equality as to ignore the handicaps preventingmany black and brown workers from obtaining equal employment opportunities.Accordingly, the Bill will contain provisions allowing (but not requiring)employers and training organisations to provide special training facilities to members of such groups and to encourage them to take advantage of oppor-tunities for doing particular work. There will be similar exemptions allowing the provision of special training facilities and encouragement by trade unions,employers&apos; associations, and professional and trade organisations. The bill will also allow the provision of facilities and services to meet the special needsof particular ethnic or national groups (for example, in relation to education,instruction, training and health and social services), or for the fulfilment oftraining and trade obligations to overseas countries, and permit discrimination in the employment, where necessary for these purposes, of persons of a particularethnic or national group.General Scope58. Like the 1968 Act, the new legislation will apply to employment, training and related fields, education, housing and the provision to the public of goods,facilities and services. The publication of discriminatory advertisements relating
to activities in these fields will also remain unlawful. However, many of the relevant provisions will be redefined so as to remove loopholes and anomaliesand, where appropriate, to harmonise them with comparable provisions inthe sex discrimination legislation. The Bill will bind the Crown in respect ofall situations covered by the legislation. It will contain a provision similar tothat in the Sex Discrimination Bill which will place on Ministers of the crown and Government Departments a statutory duty not to discriminate in relationto appointments to public offices.Exceptions59. The Bill will include provisions to ensure that it does not apply to personal and intimate relationships. However, the exceptions may need to be modified in the light of experience in operating the legislation. There will therefore be a power enabling the Government, after seeking the advice of the Race relations commission, to narrow, widen or repeal the exceptions by statutory instrumentrequiring an affirmative resolution in both Houses of Parliament.Employment and Related Matters60. Section 3 of the 1968 Act deals with discrimination by an employer orany person concerned with the employment of others. It will be redefined in theBill so as to make it clear that it includes the arrangements which an employermakes for the purposes of determining who should be offered employment.The Bill will also remove another ambiguity by defining employment to includeemployment under a contract personally to execute any work or labour, and itwill cover discrimination against contract workers. Employment agencies andvocational training bodies are covered in the 1968 Act only as part of theprohibition of discrimination by the providers to the public of facilities or services and by persons concerned with the employment of others. The bill will contain specific provisions covering employment agencies, vocational training bodies, and the three bodies which provide facilities or services underthe Employment and Training Act 1973 (i.e., the Manpower Services Commis-sion, the Employment Service Agency, and the Training Services Agency).There will be a similar provision to section 4 of the 1968 Act applying to dis-crimination in relation to the benefits and facilities provided by employers&apos;associations, trade unions and professional and trade organisations. The bill will contain a new provision making it unlawful for a partnership of six or morepartners to discriminate in the selection of other partners or the treatment ofexisting partners. The Bill will also make it unlawful for a body (including licensing body) to discriminate in conferring any authorisation or qualificationwhich, in law or practice, is required by a person who engages in a particulartrade or profession. Where the body is required by law to take account of aperson&apos;s character, it will be obliged to have regard to any evidence tending toshow that he, or any of his employees or agents has practised unlawful dis-crimination in the carrying on of any profession or trade.Employment Exceptions61. The Bill will modify the existing employment exceptions in certain respects.62. Under the &quot;racial balance&quot; exception to the 1968 Act an employer maydiscriminate in selecting persons for employment if he does so in good faith
for the purpose of securing or preserving a reasonable balance of persons ofdifferent racial groups employed in the undertaking or part of it. The problem with which this exception was designed to deal is that some jobs may becomeidentified with a particular ethnic group, and may then attract a disproportionatenumber of applicants from that group, especially when they are immigrantswith their own particular language and customs. Such a situation may impairgood race relations as well as good industrial relations. It may also impede theemployment prospects of the workers concerned, since they gain no experienceof working in an unsegregated industrial situation and so are handicapped in seeking promotion or moving to better jobs elsewhere. As the Race relations board has observed: &quot;for a time segregation may represent a form of accom-modation acceptable to all, but if it hardens into patterns, tensions and conflictswill occur when pressures to change the pattern arise.&quot; The extent to which employers rely upon their own interpretation of the racial balance exception isunknown. However, it has rarely been invoked in the course of investigationsby the Board and there is little evidence that its original purpose is being achieved. It may be the source of misunderstanding and abuse, preserving ratherthan discouraging segregated work units. The Government therefore accepts the Board&apos;s recommendation that since the exception provides a legal justifica-tion for discrimination and thereby detracts from the Act as a code of conductwithout, in practice, appearing to provide any tangible compensating advantages,it should be repealed. The right approach to the problem will be by securinggenuine equality of opportunity and treatment, regardless of colour, race orethnic or national origins, throughout all sectors of industry, and by providingfacilities to meet the special training needs of workers of particular ethnic or national origins. The Bill will allow the provision of facilities and services to meetsuch special needs.63. The exception in section 8(11) of the 1968 Act for the selection of aperson of a particular nationality or descent for employment requiring attributesespecially possessed by persons of that nationality or descent will be replaced bya narrower exception applying to the selection of a person for a job where theessential nature of the job calls for a person of a particular colour, race orethnic or national origins for reasons of authenticity (e.g., acting, or being awaiter in a Chinese restaurant with a distinctive Chinese decor) or, exceptionally,to enable the special needs of a particular ethnic or national group to be met ora training or trade commitment to an overseas country to be fulfilled. A newexception will be made to the advertising provision (paragraph 76 below),permitting the publication of an advertisement indicating that a person of aparticular colour, race or ethnic or national origins is required for such a job.64. The 1968 Act contains six separate exceptions allowing discrimination inemployment on ships or aircraft. The Government considers that these excep-tions could be inconsistent with the general principle of non-discrimination andis therefore engaged in consultations with both sides of the industry in an endeavour to resolve any problems.Education65. There is no separate education provision in the 1968 Act. Facilities for education, instruction or training are merely listed in section 2(2) as one example of facilities and services provided to the public or a section of the public.
66. The Bill will contain separate provisions making it unlawful for educa-tional establishments to discriminate, or for an education authority, in carryingout its functions under the Education Acts, to do any act which constitutesunlawful discrimination, and imposing a general duty upon bodies in the public sector of education to secure that their facilities are provided without racial discrimination. The Bill will also allow the provision of education to meet thespecial needs of individual pupils or groups of pupils of whatever ethnic or national origins.67. The general duty in the public sector will be enforceable in the firstinstance by the Education Ministers in those areas in which they have thenecessary powers under the Education Acts. The special procedures for the enforcement of the education provisions of the Bill are described in paragraph103 below.Housing Accommodation, etc.68. Section 5 of the 1968 Act makes it unlawful to discriminate in the disposalor management of housing accommodation, business premises or other land;and section 7 contains exceptions for the disposal of residential accommodation(a) by a landlord living in small premises and sharing relevant accommodationwith persons who are not members of his household, or (b) by an owner-occupier who does not use the services of an estate agent or advertise. these provisions will be retained in the Bill, but they will be brought into line with the equivalent provisions of the Sex Discrimination Bill so as to avoid possibledifferences of judicial interpretation of the two statutes where they are intendedto cover identical ground.69. Section 5 of the Race Relations Act 1965 (which was not repealed by the1968 Act) relates to racially discriminatory restrictions on the transfer oftenancies. The provision is anomalous in the light of the housing provisions ofthe 1968 Act and of the Bill; it will therefore be repealed. Under the Bill such restrictions will be void by virtue of the provision dealing with discriminatoryterms in contracts (paragraph 78). The Bill will contain a specific provisionmaking it unlawful for a landlord to discriminate against the prospectiveassignee or sublessee of a tenancy by withholding consent to the assignment orsubletting.Goods, Facilities and Services70. Section 2 of the 1968 Act makes it unlawful for any person concernedwith the provision to the public or a section of the public of goods, facilities or services to discriminate against anyone seeking to obtain or use them. Thisprovision will be retained in the Bill, which will make clear that it includesindirect access to benefits, facilities or services. The Bill will allow the provisionof facilities and services to meet the special needs of persons of particular ethnicor national origins.71. Section 7(6) of the 1968 Act provides that it is not unlawful by virtue ofsection 2 to discriminate against any person in respect of the provision ofsleeping cabins for passengers on a ship if compliance with that section wouldresult in persons of different colour, race or ethnic or national origins beingcompelled to share a cabin. This exception is incompatible with the principleof non-discrimination. With the concurrence of the industry as a whole it willbe repealed.
Social clubs and other voluntary bodies72. The House of Lords has decided, in two cases involving alleged racial discrimination by social clubs, that the words &quot;section of the public&quot; insection 2 of the 1968 Act do not apply to members or associate members ofsuch clubs. Some 4,000 working men&apos;s clubs, with a total membership of about^ million people, are affiliated to the Club and Institute Union and are not covered by the 1968 Act. In some towns they have replaced public houses asthe main providers of facilities for entertainment, recreation and refreshment.In addition, thousands of golf, squash, tennis and other sporting clubs registered as members&apos; clubs are, almost certainly, also outside the 1968 Act, except in sofar as they may offer only limited playing facilities to the public generally. Manyclubs do not discriminate on racial grounds but at present they may lawfullydo so. The Government considers that it is right that all clubs should be allowedto apply a test of personal acceptability to candidates for membership, but it considers that it is against the public interest that they should be entitled to do this on racial grounds. The Government believes that the relationship between members of clubs is no more personal and intimate than is the relationship between people in many situations which are rightly covered by the 1968Act; for example, the members of a small firm or trade union branch, children at school, or tenants in multi-occupied housing accommodation. In principleit is justifiable to apply the legislation in all these situations because of theinherently unjust and degrading nature of racial discrimination and itspotentially grave social consequences. In practice the objectives of the legislation will be seriously undermined if its protection does not extend beyond the work-place and the market-place to enable workers and other members of the public to obtain entertainment, recreation and refreshment together on the basis of equality, irrespective of colour or race.73. The Bill will therefore make it unlawful for a club or other voluntary body to discriminate as regards the admission of members or the treatment accorded to members. Subject to this the Bill will not, of course, affect the right of sucha body to withhold membership or facilities from someone who does not qualify for them in accordance with its rules. Small voluntary bodies will be exempted from this provision so as to avoid interference with the kind of regular socialgathering which is genuinely private and domestic in character. In addition,there will be an exception to enable bona fide social, welfare, political and sport-ing organisations whose main object is to confer benefits on a particular ethnicor national group to continue to do so.Instructions to Discriminate74. The Bill will make it unlawful for a person who has authority over another person, or in accordance with whose wishes that other person is accustomed toact, to instruct him to do any act which is unlawful by virtue of any of theprovisions described above, or to procure or attempt to procure the doing ofany such act. The special procedure for the enforcement of this provision by the race Relations Commission is described below in paragraph 105.Victimisation75. The Bill will make it unlawful to victimise a person by treating him less
favourably than other persons whether because he has brought proceedings orgiven evidence or information in connection with proceedings brought underthe Bill, or done anything else under or by reference to the Bill in relation to thediscriminator or to anyone else.Discriminatory Advertisements76. Section 6 of the 1968 Act makes it unlawful to publish or display, or to cause to be published or displayed, any advertisement or notice which indicatesor could be understood as indicating an intention to do an act of discrimination,whether or not the intended act would be unlawful by virtue of any otherprovision of the Act. For example, it is unlawful to publish an advertisementstating &quot;flats to let no coloureds&quot;, whether or not the particular premises are within the scope of the 1968 Act. This is justifiable because the public displayof racial prejudices and preferences is inherently offensive and likely to encourage the spread of discriminatory attitudes and practices. In one respect, however,Section 6 is too wide. Where the essential nature of a job calls for a person of aparticular colour, race or ethnic or national origins for reasons of authenticitythe employer will be entitled to select such a person by virtue of the exceptionreferred to in paragraph 63 above. In such a situation it is obviously right thathe should be able to indicate his preference when advertising the job vacancy,and the Bill will enable him to do so. On the other hand, in one respect section6 is too restrictive. By virtue of section 6(2) it is not unlawful to publish anadvertisement which indicates that Commonwealth citizens or any class ofsuch citizens are required for employment outside Great Britain. As a result,foreign or British employers could at present advertise in this country for whitecitizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies or for white commonwealth citizens. Although the Bill will not apply to employment overseas it will ensurethat no racially discriminatory advertisements may lawfully be published inGreat Britain. The special procedure for the enforcement of the advertisingprovision by the Race Relations Commission is described below in paragraph104. \\I &apos;Pressure to Discriminate Unlawfully, etc.77. Section 12 of the 1968 Act provides that any person who deliberatelyaids, induces or incites another person to do an unlawful act shall be treatedas doing that act. The Bill will redefine this provision so as to bring it into line with the provisions of the Sex Discrimination Bill dealing with pressure to discriminate unlawfully and the aiding of unlawful acts. The special procedure for the enforcement by the Race Relations Commission of the provisioncovering pressure to discriminate unlawfully is described below in paragraph105.Contractual Terms78. Section 23 of the 1968 Act provides that a contract or a term in a contract which contravenes the Act shall not be unenforceable by reason only of thecontravention, but may in certain circumstances be revised by the courts. TheBill will replace section 23 by provisions similar to those contained in the SexDiscrimination Bill dealing with the validity and revision of discriminatorycontractual terms.
Charities79. Section 9 of the 1968 Act exempts from the Act a provision in a futurecharitable instrument which confers benefits on persons of a particular race,descent or ethnic or national origins (but not colour) or anything done in orderto comply with such a provision or with the provisions of any existing charitableinstrument. The Bill will contain a similar exception, but it will also make clearthat any provision in an existing or future charitable instrument which confersbenefits on persons of a particular colour is void and that it is unlawful to doany act in Great Britain in order to give effect to such a provision. It willauthorise the trustees of such a charity to apply its benefits irrespective of the colour of the beneficiaries.Northern Ireland80. Like the Race Relations Acts 1965 and 1968, the Bill will not apply to northern Ireland.THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE LEGISLATION81. It is to be hoped that most institutions and individuals will respond tothe Governments positive lead in promoting equality of opportunity and willchange their practices voluntarily. However, it is essential in those cases where this does not occur that the law should be capable of providing adequate redressfor the victim of racial discrimination as well as eliminating discriminatorypractices which are against the public interest. As explained in paragraphs49-51 above, the Government proposes to adopt the new and radical approachreflected in the enforcement provisions of the Sex Discrimination Bill. It willcombine the right of individual access to legal remedies with the strategicfunctions of a powerful Race Relations Commission responsible for enforcing the law on behalf of the community as a whole.Individual RemediesEmployment and related matters82. It is proposed to use the same machinery and procedures for complaints of racial discrimination in employment and related matters as is used for com-plaints arising under the Sex Discrimination Bill and in respect of unfair dis-missals (including dismissals on allegedly racial grounds), since the two kinds of complaint are closely related. Complaints of racial discrimination will,therefore, be dealt with by the industrial tribunals in the situations described above, in paragraph 60, i.e. those involving: (a) employment and training;(b) employment agencies;(c) training organisations;(d) employers&apos; associations, trade unions and professional and trade organisations; and(e) partnerships.The industrial tribunals will also consider complaints involving instructions to discriminate, victimisation, the publication of discriminatory advertisements,pressure to discriminate, and the aiding of unlawful acts, in any of the above
situations. However, complaints relating to instructions to discriminate,discriminatory advertising, and pressure to discriminate will be made to the race Relations Commission rather than directly to the tribunals, and only theCommission will be entitled to bring them before the tribunals, and, where necessary, the courts, as described in paragraphs 104-105 below.83. The industrial tribunals consist of legally qualified chairmen assisted bylay members who are appointed from among persons nominated by the TradesUnion Congress and employers&apos; organisations. The Government will draw theattention of the nominating organisations to the desirability of including members of racial minorities among the nominees.84. Individuals will have three months from the date when the act complained of was done in which to make their complaints to the tribunals. In the case ofthose matters referred to in paragraph 82 above, which may be brought beforethe tribunals by the Commission alone, an application will have to be made within six months from the date when the act to which it relates was done.However, the tribunal will have power to hear a complaint or application whichis out of time where it considers it just and equitable to do so.85. Help will be given to a person who considers that he may have beendiscriminated against unlawfully to decide whether to institute proceedings and,if he does so, to formulate and present his case in the most effective manner.Standard forms will be made available by means of which he may question the respondent on his reasons for doing any relevant act or on any other matter which may be relevant and by means of which the respondent may if he sowishes reply to such questions. The questions and replies will, subject to thenormal rules relating to admissibility, be admissible as evidence in the proceed-ings; and if it appears to the tribunal that the respondent deliberately omittedto reply within a reasonable period or that his reply is evasive or equivocal,the tribunal will be entitled to draw any inference from that fact which it con-siders it just and equitable to draw, including an inference that he committed an unlawful act. In addition to helping the aggrieved person to ascertain thenature of the respondents case at an early stage by means of a simple, inexpen-sive procedure, this provision will also enable complaints which are groundlessor based on misunderstandings to be resolved without recourse to legal proceedings.86. In submitting a complaint and bringing any subsequent proceedings, theindividual will be able to present his own case or, if preferred, to be represented,for example, by a trade union legal representative, a community relations officer,a minority organisation, or may seek the assistance of the Race relations commission. The legal advice and assistance scheme is available to enablecomplainants of limited means to obtain legal advice on whether proceedingsshould be instituted and to give legal assistance during conciliation and, ifnecessary, in preparation of a case for hearing.87. The Commission will be able to grant assistance to an actual or prospective-tive complainant if it considers that the case raises a question of principle, or that it is unreasonable having regard to the complexity of the case or theapplicant^ position in relation to the respondent or another person involvedor any other matter to expect him to deal with the case unaided, or by reason
situations. However, complaints relating to instructions to discriminate,discriminatory advertising, and pressure to discriminate will be made to the race Relations Commission rather than directly to the tribunals, and only theCommission will be entitled to bring them before the tribunals, and, where necessary, the courts, as described in paragraphs 104-105 below.83. The industrial tribunals consist of legally qualified chairmen assisted bylay members who are appointed from among persons nominated by the TradesUnion Congress and employers&apos; organisations. The Government will draw theattention of the nominating organisations to the desirability of including members of racial minorities among the nominees.84. Individuals will have three months from the date when the act complained of was done in which to make their complaints to the tribunals. In the case ofthose matters referred to in paragraph 82 above, which may be brought beforethe tribunals by the Commission alone, an application will have to be made within six months from the date when the act to which it relates was done.However, the tribunal will have power to hear a complaint or application whichis out of time where it considers it just and equitable to do so.85. Help will be given to a person who considers that he may have beendiscriminated against unlawfully to decide whether to institute proceedings and,if he does so, to formulate and present his case in the most effective manner.Standard forms will be made available by means of which he may question the respondent on his reasons for doing any relevant act or on any other matter which may be relevant and by means of which the respondent may if he sowishes reply to such questions. The questions and replies will, subject to thenormal rules relating to admissibility, be admissible as evidence in the proceed-ings; and if it appears to the tribunal that the respondent deliberately omittedto reply within a reasonable period or that his reply is evasive or equivocal,the tribunal will be entitled to draw any inference from that fact which it con-siders it just and equitable to draw, including an inference that he committed an unlawful act. In addition to helping the aggrieved person to ascertain thenature of the respondents case at an early stage by means of a simple, inexpen-sive procedure, this provision will also enable complaints which are groundlessor based on misunderstandings to be resolved without recourse to legal proceedings.86. In submitting a complaint and bringing any subsequent proceedings, theindividual will be able to present his own case or, if preferred, to be represented,for example, by a trade union legal representative, a community relations officer,a minority organisation, or may seek the assistance of the Race relations commission. The legal advice and assistance scheme is available to enablecomplainants of limited means to obtain legal advice on whether proceedingsshould be instituted and to give legal assistance during conciliation and, ifnecessary, in preparation of a case for hearing.87. The Commission will be able to grant assistance to an actual or prospective-tive complainant if it considers that the case raises a question of principle, or that it is unreasonable having regard to the complexity of the case or the applicants position in relation to the respondent or another person involvedor any other matter to expect him to deal with the case unaided, or by reason
of any other special consideration. The Commission^ possible assistance will include: (a) giving advice;(b) procuring or attempting to procure the settlement of any matter in dispute;(c) arranging for the giving of advice or assistance by a solicitor or counselunder the legal advice and assistance scheme;(d) arranging for representation by any person.The Commission will thus have a wide discretion as to the circumstances in and the means by which it provides advice, assistance or representation to individual complainants. In exercising its discretion the Commission will haveregard to its primary strategic role as well as to the interests of individualcomplainants.88. Employment complaints will initially be considered by conciliation officers,who form part of the independent Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service.The conciliation officers will act as an independent source of conciliation and advice to try to help the parties to reach a settlement of a complaint without its being determined by a tribunal. It will also be open to a complainant to make use of any jointly agreed grievance machinery which applies in the employmentarea concerned and the conciliation officers will where appropriate encouragehim to do so in an appropriate case. This will replace the existing provisions for the mandatory use of voluntary industry machinery in the 1968 Act.89. Complaints which are not settled by conciliation nor withdrawn will be heard by the tribunals. Where the complainant alleges that he has been dis-criminated against on racial grounds he will have to discharge the normalburden of proof applicable to civil proceedings. He will therefore have to showthat the respondent has acted to his detriment in circumstances suggesting thatsuch detrimental action has been taken on racial grounds. It will then be for the respondent to show that the complainant has not been treated less favourablythan other persons on those grounds. Different considerations apply where the complainant alleges that (irrespective of motive) he has been discriminatedagainst by reason of the application to him of a requirement or condition which is racially discriminatory in its effect (paragraph 55 above). In that event the complainant will have to show that the respondent has applied a requirementor condition to him such that the proportion of persons of the relevant colour,race or ethnic or national origins able to comply with it is considerably smaller than the proportion of other persons able to do so. It will then be for the respondent to prove that the requirement or condition is justifiable. the respondent will not be liable to compensate a victim if he can show that the requirement or condition in question was not applied with the intention of treating the claimant unfavourably on racial grounds.90. Where the tribunal is satisfied that unlawful discrimination has occurred in a particular case, it will be able: (a) to declare the rights of the parties; and/or(b) to make an award of compensation; and/or
(c) to recommend that the respondent take action to obviate or reduce the adverse effect on the complainant of any act of discrimination to whichthe complaint relates.The compensation which may be awarded may include compensation for injury to feelings. The amount of compensation which may be awarded to a complainantwill not exceed the amount for the time being specified in paragraph 20(1)(6) of schedule I to the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 (i.e.  5,200).However, if without reasonable justification the respondent fails to complywith a recommendation under (c) above, the tribunal will have power on furtherapplication to increase the amount of compensation paid to the complainant,or, if an award under (b) above could have been made but was not, the tribunalwill have power to make such an award.91. The decisions of the tribunals will, as at present, be recorded in thepublic register at the Central Offices of Industrial Tribunals. The secretaries of the tribunals will inform the Commission of all decisions.92. An individual^ direct interest in a case will normally end with the tribunals decision on his case, or with the outcome of any appeal against the tribunals decision. The individual will not normally have any direct interest in following up his case provided that the respondent complies with the tribunalsdecision. It will, however, be essential for relevant tribunal decisions as well asthe Commissions non-discrimination notices (paragraph 112 below) to befollowed up so as to ensure proper compliance with the legislation in the publicinterest on behalf of the community as a whole. Accordingly, the commission will, where appropriate, be able to seek injunctions or orders before speciallydesignated county courts in England and Wales and sheriff courts in Scotland,in the manner described below in paragraphs 115-116.93. Appeals will lie from industrial tribunals on points of law to the proposedEmployment Appeal Tribunal, and thereafter to the Court of Appeal, or, inScotland, to the Court of Session.Other complaints94. Industrial tribunals are not equipped to deal with complaints of dis-crimination outside the employment field. Such complaints will be dealt withby specially designated county courts and sheriff courts in Scotland. They willrelate to the situations described above, in paragraphs 65-73, involving: (a) education;(b) housing accommodation, etc.; and(c) the provision of goods, facilities and services.There will be special procedures in relation to education, which are described below in paragraph 103.95. The county courts and sheriff courts will also consider complaintsinvolving instructions to discriminate, victimisation, the publication of discriminatory advertising, and the aiding of unlawful acts in any of the non-employment situations covered by the Bill. However, as in the field of employ-ment, complaints relating to instructions to discriminate, discriminatoryadvertising, and pressure to discriminate will be made to the Commission
rather than directly to the courts, and only the Commission will be entitled tobring them before the courts, as described below in paragraph 104.96. Under the 1968 Act the judge or sheriff is assisted by two assessors withspecial knowledge and experience of problems connected with community andrace relations. These provisions enable the courts (like the industrial tribunals)to have the benefit of lay expertise and minority representation in dealing with cases under the race relations legislation. It is therefore proposed to retain these provisions in the Bill, while enabling the attendance of the assessors to be dispensed with by agreement between the parties. The assessors will be appointedfrom lists of persons prepared and maintained by the Home Secretary and theSecretary of State for Scotland, being persons appearing to them to have special knowledge and experience of situations covered by the Bill. TheGovernment intends to ensure that members of racial minorities and otherswith relevant knowledge and experience are substantially represented in theselists. For example, those who have had experience of the work of the conciliationcommittees would have a valuable contribution to make.97. Individuals will normally have six months in which to bring proceedings in the courts. In the case of those matters referred to in paragraph 82 above which may be brought before the courts only by the Commission proceedingswill have to be instituted within six months from the date when the act to whichthey relate was done. However, the court will have power to hear a claim orapplication which is out of time if it considers that it is just and equitable todo so.98. A person who considers that he may have been discriminated againstunlawfully will be given help to decide whether to institute proceedings and,if he does so, to formulate and present his case in the most effective manner,by means of the procedure described above in paragraph 85. As in the employ-ment field, the legal advice and assistance scheme is available to enable a person of limited means to obtain legal advice on whether proceedings should be instituted. In addition, legal aid will be available to enable prospective plaintiffsof limited means with reasonable prospects of success to institute proceedings in the county courts and sheriff courts. Although there will be no formalmachinery for conciliation (such as will be available for complaints in theemployment field) before cases come before the courts, the ordinary powersof the courts and the risks inherent in litigation should encourage the parties and their representatives to settle their differences without unnecessary resort to legal proceedings. The process of attempted settlement which the legal profession normally undertakes before advising on the commencement of legal proceedings as well as after proceedings have actually been launched will therefore be applicable to disputes arising under the Bill. Furthermore, sincethe Commission^ power to give assistance to an actual or prospective plaintiffdescribed above in paragraph 87, will include the power to give advice and to procure or attempt to procure the settlement of any matter in dispute, theCommission itself will in appropriate cases be able to secure a settlement of a dispute without the necessity to resort to litigation.99. The position as regards the burden of proof will be the same as the positionin employment and related matters described above in paragraph 89 for directdiscrimination and for indirect unjustifiable discrimination respectively.
100. Where the court is satisfied that unlawful discrimination has occurred in the particular case, it will be able to grant the normal remedies obtainablefor a claim in tort (or, in Scotland, in reparation for breach of statutory duty).Thus, the court will be able: (a) to declare that the defendant has acted unlawfully; and/or(b) to award damages (including compensation for injury to feelings);and/or(c) to grant an injunction (or make an order) restraining the defendant fromdiscriminating unlawfully against the plaintiff.The court will also be able, on the application of any person interested in a contract, to make an order removing or modifying a term in such a contractmade unenforceable by the Bill provisions contemplated in paragraph 78.101. Although there are differences in the precise form of relief which may begranted by the industrial tribunals and the civil courts, the same principleswill apply to the scope of relief in individual cases. The individual complainantwill be entitled to seek remedies appropriate to redress the particular wrongwhich he has suffered by reason of an act of unlawful discrimination. He willnot be entitled to seek any wider form of relief (e.g., general injunctive reliefrestraining persistent discrimination). The Race Relations Commission willhave the exclusive right to seek such wider forms of relief in the public interest.102. Appeals will lie from the county courts to the Court of Appeal and fromthe sheriff courts to the Court of Session.Education103. As regards those bodies over which the Education Ministers exercisepowers under the Education Acts, complaints of unlawful discrimination orbreach of statutory duty will be made in the first instance to the appropriate minister. Individual legal proceedings will be precluded for a period notexceeding two months during which the Minister will consider the complaintand whether to exercise his powers. If, after the expiry of that period, the complainant remains dissatisfied, he will be entitled to bring proceedings in thecourts. As regards those educational bodies over which the Education Ministersexercise no statutory powers (including the universities) the complainant willhave immediate access to his legal remedies in the courts.Complaints assigned to the Commission104. All complaints about discriminatory advertisements will be made tothe Commission. This is desirable because this type of complaint could not usually be shown to have any substantial prejudicial effect which could form thebasis of an individual application to a court or tribunal. Moreover it will avoidnumerous complaints in respect of the same advertisement being processedseparately. The Commission will be able to take the matter up, for example,with the employer and/or advertiser concerned and, where appropriate, to seekassurances as to future advertisements. Where necessary, the Commission willbe able to institute legal proceedings.105. All complaints about instructions or pressure to discriminate unlawfullywill be made to the Commission, which will take the matter up with the persons concerned. The aim wherever possible will be to resolve such situations by
persuasion and conciliation. However, the Commission will as a last resort beable to take legal proceedings. If, in the course of ordinary individual pro-ceedings before a tribunal or court, it becomes apparent that the person against whom proceedings have been brought may have been under instructions orpressure from other persons to discriminate unlawfully, the tribunal or court,in addition to deciding the case before it, will be able to advise the parties ofthe right to complain about such pressure directly to the Commission.Occupational Licensing106. In addition to the individuals right of access to legal redress from the tribunals or courts, the Bill will also enable complainants to make representa-tions to bodies conferring authorisations or qualifications to engage in aparticular profession or trade about any acts of unlawful discrimination alleged to have been done by an applicant for such an authorisation or qualificationor by his employees or agents. Such bodies will be required to have regard tosuch evidence in deciding whether the applicant is of sufficiently good character to be granted the necessary authorisation or qualification.107. Where the applicant considers that the relevant body has discriminatedunlawfully against him in deciding whether to confer the authorisation orqualification upon him, he will be entitled to appeal against the decision.THE RACE RELATIONS COMMISSIONComposition ant! Staffing, etc.108. It is proposed to create a Race Relations Commission consisting of a chairman and not more than 14 other members appointed by the Home Secretaryafter consultation with the other Ministers concerned. The Bill will not specifyfixed quotas for persons of particular colour, race or ethnic or national origins;to do so would be contrary to the principle of selection on individual personalmerit upon which the Bill depends. However, the Government will ensure thatthe various racial minorities are substantially represented in its composition.Members of the Commission will be appointed from persons with a wide range of relevant knowledge and experience (e.g., from industry, commerce, the professions, education, minority organisations, and those with special knowledge and experience of the operation of anti-discrimination legislation). It will include full-time and part-time members. It will be able to set up committees to deal with particular aspects of its work, and there will be provision for theappointment of additional commissioners to conduct special inquiries. TheCommission will have a number of offices throughout the country and its staff will have appropriate specialist qualifications. In formulating these proposals the Government has had regard to the recommendation of the Select Committeeon the composition and structure of the new Commission.Main Functions109. The Commissions main functions will be: (a) to conduct investigations in areas covered by the Bill and take actionto eliminate unlawful practices;(b) to promote equality of opportunity between people of different colour,race or ethnic or national origins generally;
(c) to conduct inquiries into matters outside the scope of the legislation which may affect the relative positions and opportunities of the differentracial, ethnic and national sections of the community;(d) to assist and represent individual complainants in appropriate cases;(e) to keep the operation of the legislation under review and make recom-mendations;(/) to conduct research and to take action to educate and persuade publicopinion.110. As mentioned in paragraph 52 above, the precise nature of the relation-ship between the Commission and local community effort will depend upon the outcome of further consultation. However, whatever the decision, the Corn-mission will necessarily maintain a close working relationship through itsregional staff with local community relations officers and their community relations councils as well as with the various minority organisations. The Corn-mission will have links with the appropriate central and regional bodies. Thechairman of the Commission will serve on the proposed Standing AdvisoryCouncil (see paragraph 21 above). The Home Office will be the Departmentprimarily responsible for the Commission. However, the Commission willalso, of course, have direct access to those concerned with the development andimplementation of race relations policies in the relevant Government Depart-ments. It will be a valuable source of information and advice about the operation and effect of such policies. The Commission will also be a source of practicalguidance to those affected by the legislation about practices and procedures which would promote equality of opportunity and encourage compliance withthe spirit as well as the letter of the law.Investigations by the Commission111. The Commission will be entitled to conduct formal investigations on itsown initiative for any purpose connected with the carrying out of its functions.It may also be required by the Home Secretary or the Secretary of State forScotland to conduct investigations. Investigations may either be wide-rangingor confined to a particular organisation or individual. The terms of reference for a formal investigation will be drawn up by the Commission (where relevantin consultation with the Home Secretary or the Secretary of State for Scotland).In the course of such an investigation the Commission will be able, where necessary, to require the furnishing of written information and the productionof documents as well as to summon witnesses to give evidence; and it will beable to seek a court order in cases of failure or refusal to comply with such a requirement. These powers to compel the disclosure of information and the giving of information will only be exercisable if either (a) the Home secretary has given appropriate authorisation or (b) the terms of reference of the investigation state that the Commission believes that a particular organisa-tion, or individual named in them, may have done or may be doing unlawfuldiscriminatory acts, and confine the investigation to that matter. There will berestrictions on the disclosure of information obtained in the exercise of these powers so as to ensure respect for personal privacy and confidentiality.112. Upon completion of an investigation, the Commission will establish the relevant facts and will publish or make available for inspection a report which might include recommendations for changes in policies and procedures,
or recommendations to the Home Secretary for changes in the law or other changes. Where an investigation discloses an unlawful act or practice theCommission will be empowered to issue a non-discrimination notice requiring the recipient to cease doing such acts or operating such practices or to alterhis practices so as to comply with the law. The Commission will not issue anon-discrimination notice unless it (a) has first given notice to the recipient ofits intention to do so, specifying the grounds, and (b) has offered him anopportunity of making oral or written representations. It will, however, be able,where appropriate, to require the recipient to take reasonable steps to makeknown, to those likely to be affected, the changes which are made in the practiceconcerned, and to inform the Commission that he has effected those changes and what those changes are. A non-discrimination notice will also be able torequire the recipient to furnish the Commission with such other informationas may be reasonably required by the notice in order to verify that the noticehas been complied with. It may specify the time at which, and the manner and form in which, any information is to be furnished to the Commission.113. The recipient will be entitled to appeal to the tribunal or court (as thecase may be) against any requirement of the notice on the ground that it isunjustified or unreasonable. The tribunal or court will determine on the evidencewhether to confirm the notice or to quash it, with or without any amendments.If no appeal is made against a notice within six weeks from the date when itwas served or if the recipients appeal is unsuccessful and the notice is confirmed by the tribunal or court, the notice will become final (i.e., non-compliance withits terms will render the recipient liable to legal proceedings). All non-discrimina-tion notices which have become final will be recorded in a public registermaintained by the Commission.114. The Commission will be able to undertake a further investigation atany time within five years from the date on which a non-discrimination noticehas become final so as to ascertain whether the recipient has complied withits terms. xiiOther powers of enforcement115. If, within five years from the date when a non-discrimination notice or afinding by a court or tribunal of unlawful discrimination has become final inrelation to any person, it appears to the Commission that he is likely again toact unlawfully, the Commission will be able to apply to the county court for an injunction (or, in Scotland, to the sheriff court for an order) restraining him from doing so.116. With a view to applying for an injunction or order against persistentdiscrimination in the field of employment and related matters, if the tribunalhas not already made a finding that a person has done an unlawful act, theCommission will be empowered to present to the tribunal a complaint that hehas acted unlawfully. If the tribunal considers that the complaint is well-founded it will make a finding to that effect, and it may also:  &apos;(a) declare the rights of the person discriminated against and the respondent;and/or(b) recommend that the respondent take action to obviate or reduce the adverse effect on the person discriminated against of the discriminationto which the complaint relates.
or recommendations to the Home Secretary for changes in the law or other changes. Where an investigation discloses an unlawful act or practice theCommission will be empowered to issue a non-discrimination notice requiring the recipient to cease doing such acts or operating such practices or to alterhis practices so as to comply with the law. The Commission will not issue anon-discrimination notice unless it (a) has first given notice to the recipient ofits intention to do so, specifying the grounds, and (b) has offered him anopportunity of making oral or written representations. It will, however, be able,where appropriate, to require the recipient to take reasonable steps to makeknown, to those likely to be affected, the changes which are made in the practiceconcerned, and to inform the Commission that he has effected those changes and what those changes are. A non-discrimination notice will also be able torequire the recipient to furnish the Commission with such other informationas may be reasonably required by the notice in order to verify that the noticehas been complied with. It may specify the time at which, and the manner and form in which, any information is to be furnished to the Commission.113. The recipient will be entitled to appeal to the tribunal or court (as thecase may be) against any requirement of the notice on the ground that it isunjustified or unreasonable. The tribunal or court will determine on the evidencewhether to confirm the notice or to quash it, with or without any amendments.If no appeal is made against a notice within six weeks from the date when itwas served or if the recipients appeal is unsuccessful and the notice is confirmed by the tribunal or court, the notice will become final (i.e., non-compliance withits terms will render the recipient liable to legal proceedings). All non-discrimina-tion notices which have become final will be recorded in a public registermaintained by the Commission.114. The Commission will be able to undertake a further investigation atany time within five years from the date on which a non-discrimination noticehas become final so as to ascertain whether the recipient has complied withits terms. vOther powers of enforcement115. If, within five years from the date when a non-discrimination notice or afinding by a court or tribunal of unlawful discrimination has become final inrelation to any person, it appears to the Commission that he is likely again toact unlawfully, the Commission will be able to apply to the county court for an injunction (or, in Scotland, to the sheriff court for an order) restraining him from doing so.116. With a view to applying for an injunction or order against persistentdiscrimination in the field of employment and related matters, if the tribunalhas not already made a finding that a person has done an unlawful act, theCommission will be empowered to present to the tribunal a complaint that hehas acted unlawfully. If the tribunal considers that the complaint is well-founded it will make a finding to that effect, and it may also: (a) declare the rights of the person discriminated against and the respondent;and/or(b) recommend that the respondent take action to obviate or reduce the adverse effect on the person discriminated against of the discriminationto which the complaint relates.
However, only the Commission will be able to apply for an injunction (or, in*   Scotland, for an order) in the field of employment and related matters.117. The Commission will be able to take similar preliminary action before,  a tribunal with a view to applying for an injunction or order against persistentdiscrimination in relation to discriminatory advertising, and instructions orpressure to discriminate unlawfully in the field of employment and related matters.118. The Commission will be able to take further action to eliminate unlawfulpractices. For example, it will be able to draw unlawful conduct to the attentionof relevant public authorities and private institutions.Individual complaints119. The Commission will be informed of all complaints made to the tribunals or courts and will receive copies of all decisions. It will become a source of information generally about the working of the legislation inrelation to individual complaints. It will have the power where appropriate to advise and assist individuals in preparing and presenting complaints, toattempt to settle any matter in dispute, and to help complainants to conductlegal proceedings, including appeals (paragraphs 87 and 98). However, it willnot be under any duty to give advice or assistance, but will be empowered to doso at its discretion (paragraph 87). Moreover, the Commission will have no greater power in representing an individual than would be enjoyed by theindividual or his representative (see paragraphs 5 and 111).Inquiries into areas not covered by the Bill120. The Commission^ role will not be confined to the promotion of equalopportunity and the elimination of racial discrimination in the narrow legalsense. It will also be able to conduct wide-ranging inquiries into matters not covered by the Bill which cause or contribute to discrimination, prejudice anddisadvantage. For these purposes, the Commission will be empowered torequire the furnishing of written information and the production of documentsas well as to summon witnesses to give evidence. However, these powers willbe exercised only with the consent of the Home Secretary or the Secretary ofState for Scotland and subject to the safeguards referred to above in paragraph111.Monitoring the legislation121. The Commission will advise the Government about the operation ofthe legislation and about any statutory orders to be made under the Bill (e.g.to narrow, widen or repeal exceptions to the scope of the Bill).Research and promotional functions122. In addition, the Commission will be able to conduct or support research,and it will be represented on the Advisory Committee on Race RelationsResearch. It will also take action to educate and persuade public opinion witha view to promoting equality of opportunity irrespective of colour, race orethnic or national origins.
123. The Commission will be required to make periodic reports to theSecretary of State about its activities. Its reports will be laid before parliament and will be open for debate in the usual way.RACIAL INCITEMENT AND PUBLIC ORDER124. Section 6 of the Race Relations Act 1965 created the offence of incitement to racial hatred. A person is guilty of the offence if, with the deliberate intentionof stirring up racial hatred, he circulates written matter or uses words in publicwhich (a) are threatening, abusive or insulting and (b) are likely to stir up suchhatred. Section 5 of the Theatres Act 1968 also made it an offence for anyone topresent or direct a public performance of a play, involving the use of threatening,abusive or insulting words, with the deliberate intention of stirring up racial hatred, if that performance, taken as a whole, is likely to have such an effect.Both offences are punishable, on summary conviction, by a maximum of sixmonths&apos; imprisonment or a fine of  200, or both; and, on conviction on indict-ment, by a maximum of two years&apos; impusonment or a fine of  1,000, or both.No prosecution can be brought in England and Wales for either offence except by or with the consent of the Attorney General.125. These offences are entirely separate from the anti-discriminationprovisions of the race relations legislation. They deal with the stirring up of racial hatred rather than with acts of racial discrimination; they are criminalrather than civil; and they are enforced in the criminal courts rather than by the race Relations Board in the civil courts. In several respects they are similar tothe offence under Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1936 of using threatening,abusive or insulting words, in any public place or at any public meeting, with intent to provoke a breach of the peace or whereby a breach of the peace islikely to be occasioned. They are concerned to prevent the stirring up of racial hatred which may beget violence and public disorder.126. Relatively few prosecutions have been brought under Section 6 of the1965 Act and none has been brought under Section 5 of the Theatres Act.However, during the past decade, probably largely as a result of Section 6, therehas been a decided change in the style of racialist propaganda. It tends to be lessblatantly bigoted, to disclaim any intention of stirring up racial hatred, and topurport to make a contribution to public education and debate. Whilst thisshift away from crudely racialist propaganda and abuse is welcome, it is not anunmixed benefit. The more apparently rational and moderate is the message,the greater is its probable impact on public opinion. But it is not justifiable in a democratic society to interfere with freedom of expression except where it isnecessary to do so for the prevention of disorder or for the protection of otherbasic freedoms. The present law penalises crude verbal attacks if and only if it is established that they have been made with the deliberate intention of causinggroups to be hated because of their racial origins. In the Governments view this is too narrow an approach. It accepts the observation made by Sir LeslieScarman in his report on the Red Lion Square disorders that Section 6 is toorestrictively defined to be an effective sanction. It therefore proposes to ensurethat it will no longer be necessary to prove a subjective intention to stir upracial hatred.127. The present law does not, however, penalise the dissemination of ideas
based on an assumption of racial superiority or inferiority or facts (whethertrue or false) which may encourage racial prejudice or discrimination. It is arguable that false and evil publications of this kind may well be more effectivelydefeated by public education and debate than by prosecution and that in&apos; practice the criminal law would be ineffective to deal with such material. due regard must also of course be paid to allowing the free expression of opinion.The Government is not therefore at this stage putting forward proposals toextend the criminal law to deal with the dissemination of racialist propaganda in the absence of a likelihood that group hatred will be stirred up by it. it recognises, however, that strong views are held on this important question and will carefully consider any further representations that may be made to it.CONCLUSIONTowards an Effective Race Relations Policy128. When Parliament first legislated ten years ago to make racial discrimina-tion unlawful, it involved for this country a pioneering and novel use of thelaw to deal with a new social situation which had arisen as a result of thesettlement of immigrants from the coloured Commonwealth and of the difficul-ties they encountered. The experience of the intervening years has confirmed that the use of law to secure equality of treatment and to provide an individualremedy has lost none of its relevance. Indeed, the Government believes that thenature and scale of the problems involved gives urgency to the need to strengthen the existing legislation along the lines set out in this White Paper.129. The Government has no wish, however, in proposing these measures toencourage a discussion of race relations solely in terms of &quot;problems&quot;, still less to imply that the racial minority communities who now constitute an integral part of our society are helpless victims in need of constant attention and assist-ance. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Teachers and social workers in areas of immigrant settlement have testified frequently in the past to the leavenof energy and resourcefulness that the immigrant communities have broughtwith them into our society. The Government endorses that view. That is why itbelieves that it is vital to our well-being as a society to tap these reservoirs ofresilience, initiative and vigour in the racial minority groups and not to allow them to lie unused or to be deflected into negative protest on account of arbitraryand unfair discriminatory practices. In any full strategy for better race relations,the voluntary initiatives of the racial minority communities and their organisa-tions will play an indispensable part.130. Nor is it wise or fair to understate the extent of tolerance in our society.The Government is impressed by the sheer scale and diversity of the voluntaryinitiatives that have been undertaken in the last decade, by groups of ordinarymen and women, with no reward or recognition in mind, in order to create a slightly more humane and open society in these islands. Without their spon-taneous and unofficial initiatives, Government action by itself will alwaysremain incomplete.Printed in England for Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office by Harrison &amp; Sons (Hayes) Ltd.158S9 Dd 141831  K60 9/75
