WHITE PAPERREDEVELOPMENT OF THE LONDON DOCKLANDS[GOVERNMENT OBSERVATIONS ON THE FIFTH REPORT FROMTHE EXPENDITURE COMMITTEE (ENVIRONMENTSUB-COMMITTEE): HOUSE OF COMMONS PAPER 348 SESSION1974-75]1. In May 1975, the Expenditure Committee of the House of Commonspublished their report on the Redevelopment of the London Docklands*.This report was based on the consideration which its Environment Sub-Committee gave earlier in the year to evidence from Government Departments,the Docklands Joint Committee, the Greater London Council (GLC), the fiveLondon boroughs concerned and other public bodies, private individuals and interested organisations. This White Paper conveys the Government^ observa-tions on that report.2. The Sub-Committee addressed itself particularly to three aspects of the redevelopment of Docklands:  finance and public expenditure, the organisational structure for the task, and employment policies.The reports conclusions and recommendations on these aspects are individuallydiscussed in the latter part of this paper, but the Government has some more general observations to make first to set the scene.GENERAL OBSERVATIONS3. The redevelopment of the London Docklands is, of its kind, the greatestchallenge of our time. Docklands covers 8^ square miles, and is the largestarea in London available for redevelopment since the Great Fire over 300 yearsago. It is the largest urban area for redevelopment in Europe. It already provides a home for about 55,000 people, and in a generation will have the populationof a medium-sized town. The task is to provide many new homes, new places of work, and the amenities of modern life, not only for those who live or workin the area today, but also for those who will live or work in the area in thefuture; not only for the present generation but also for their children, andtheir children&apos;s children.4. Although the timescale for the operation, and the cost remain to be worked out, there is no doubt, even now, that both will be very substantial.There have been developments on this scale before for instance in the planning and development of new towns; but in Docklands there are special complexities:this is not a site in the green fields, but one where people work and livealready and redevelopment must be carried out in such a way as to preserve and enhance the every day life that people lead meanwhile;*House of Commons Paper 348, Session 1974-75.1
the obsolescent heritage of the past provides opportunities but it alsocreates difficulties for new development; and some of these, if they are tobe overcome, can only be overcome at high cost;Docklands is not self-contained, nor should it be: its development is part of the development of the five boroughs in which it lies, within the physical and financial framework of London as a whole, and within the broader context of the South East.This is the magnitude and difficulty of the task that confronts the DocklandsDevelopment Team and the Docklands Joint Committee. The continuation ofthe Docklands Joint Committee was recommended by the expenditure committee, and for the reason given in paragraph 16 below, the Governmentis confident that the Committee and the Team will be equal to this uniqueopportunity and challenge.5. The Government welcomes the Expenditure Committee&apos;s report on this important undertaking and thanks the Environment Sub-Committee for examining it with such care. It notes the careful thought given to the regionalimplications of the development, and agrees with their conclusion that Dock-lands employment problems are symptomatic of a wider structural changetaking place in London as a whole and that the evidence does not support abasic change in Industrial Development Certificate (IDC) policy in favour ofDocklands. It notes the Committee&apos;s view that financial commitments in Dock-lands will have to be at the expense of other public sector projects, or add to public sector borrowing requirements.OBSERVATIONS ON SPECIFIC recommendations. The Committee made eight specific recommendations, and the paragraphswhich follow give the Governments views on them.Public ExpenditureRecommendations 1 and 2 (Report: paragraphs 30 and 31)7. The Committee recommended: &quot;that the Department of the Environment should, where a significantGovernment financial commitment may be involved, give firm guidanceat an early stage regarding the possible range and/or phasing of public expenditure&quot;; and&quot;that DOE should give specific guidance on the level of public expendi-ture commitment for Dockland, and that the Government should stateits intentions on the question of providing financial support&quot;.8. The Government is already taking steps to bring local authorities more into its forward planning of public expenditure, notably through the newly-formed Consultative Council on Local Government Finance. As part of this process of consultation it will be giving more guidance to authorities on thepublic expenditure resources likely to be available at least within the normalfive year horizon of the annual public expenditure survey. These discussions are concerned with national totals on individual local authority services ratherthan with the methods by which individual Government departments may
from time to time decide on the distribution of borrowing approvals between individual local authorities for specific projects. Nor can they by their naturecover the decisions which an individual authority may itself take about thedistribution within its area of the resources available to it. Within these limitations, however, the Department is prepared to discuss with the authorities concerned the pace at which resources are likely to be available for the re-development of Docklands.9. Developments in Docklands will be eligible for the normal forms ofGovernment financial support to transport, housing and other purposes. TheGovernment has no plans for special forms of support over and beyond these.But within the normal forms of support the Government believes that importantprogress can be made piece by piece and phase by phase within the framework of the overall strategy.Recommendation 3 (Report: paragraph 32)10. After discussing the allocation of resources within any one region, theCommittee recommends: &quot;that the current monitoring of progress of the Strategic Plan for theSouth East should be widened to include the preparation of proper criteria for national guidance to planning authorities on priorities for majorregional expenditure&quot;.11. In setting up the review of the Strategic Plan for the South East, theGovernment has recognised the importance of relating the proposals containedin the Plan for the distribution of population within the region to the levels of real and financial resources likely to be available to the public sector. Accord-ingly studies have been set in hand of the overall allocation of public sectorfunds within the region, together with an assessment of the importance of specific major projects to regional planning objectives. An important objective of this work will be to ascertain the relative costs falling on the public sector of alternative patterns of urban development, as between different parts of the region, in particular, between London and the rest of the South East.12. Ideally, as noted in paragraph 27 of the Committee&apos;s report, criteria forassessing the merits of alternative forms and patterns of development should include an assessment of the wider social and economic implications for individuals, industry and commerce. It will be possible to cover only some ofthese, possibly only in specific geographical locations, in the time-scale of thecurrent review. Many items are very difficult to measure in quantitative terms and hence to embody in formal criteria. The public sector resource studies,which are due to be completed by the middle of next year, will, however, make an important contribution towards the development of criteria for the allocation of resources within the region.13. The main strategic significance of the redevelopment of the Docklandslies, however, in East London and Greater London as a whole. In populationterms, for example, Docklands will never form more than one per cent of thepopulation in the South East. While the regional studies will provide the overallcontext for decisions in Docklands, priority should be given to reaching decisions on its development which meet the needs of the area and those most closely related to it.
Recommendation 4 (Report: paragraph 33)oC14. The Committee gave particular consideration to expenditure on theimprovement of public transport serving Docklands. It recommended:  &quot;&quot;that studies should be made of alternative proposals for a long-term tDockland public transport system based upon existing surface lines and C15. The Docklands Joint Committee has already published a consultationpaper entitled &quot;The Dockland Spine Tube, Bus or Tram?&quot;, which discussesthe merits of various means of providing for improved east-west communica-tions, including the use of existing surface lines and rights of way as well as   ;the River Line option. A further paper dealing with the transport infra-structure   !for Docklands as a whole has also been published. Between them, these papers   1provide the framework for considering the relative merits of individual projects,among which the River Line is the most prominent. Specific proposals and    ipriorities for investment will need to be considered within the framework ofthe GLCs Transport Policies and Programme submissions for London as a jwhole. Any Government contribution to the financing of transport projects for Dockland will be through Transport Supplementary Grant. They will haveto compete with other priorities within London and in the rest of the country.Organisational Structure16. The Committee scrutinised closely the organisational structure for theDocklands project, and the powers available to the Docklands Joint Committee.The Government welcomes and endorses the Committee&apos;s main conclusion onthis, that the Docklands Joint Committee should continue at any rate for thepresent as the responsible authority for the redevelopment of Docklands. It isnatural that there should have been debate in evidence to the expenditure committee and elsewhere about the type of organisation best suited to thisunique task. The Government consider that it is now appropriate to bring the debate to a close, and is glad of the chance to state its own firm conclusion onthe matter. Because the Joint Committee is constituted from the five London boroughs and the Greater London Council, and can, by delegation exercisecertain of their powers, the Government consider it to be the right mechanismto carry forward the strategic planning of the project in full and due accord with the requirements and development of the surrounding area.Recommendations 5 and 6 (Report: paragraphs 42 and 46)17. Within this framework the Committee recommended: &quot;that the number of co-opted members (on the Docklands Joint Com-mittee) should, as a matter of urgency, be increased to the maximum (i.e.eight), and the range of experience and interests of the co-opted membershipbroadened as widely as is practicable&quot;; and&quot;that the land acquisition and disposal functions of the Councils underthe Community Land Bill, if enacted, should be delegated to the DocklandsJoint Committee&quot;.18. The Government agrees with the Expenditure Committee that the JointCommittee&apos;s membership should be broadened by filling the outstanding vacanciesrights of way&quot;.Ic
on it for outside, co-opted members. This is primarily a matter for the JointCommittee, whose standing orders provide that they shall have regard to anynominations made for this purpose by the Secretary of State for the Environ-ment. Consultations about this have taken place, and the Government hopes that the Expenditure Committee&apos;s recommendation will be fulfilled. TheGovernment also fully accepts the Committee&apos;s comment on the role of theDOE observers on the Officers&apos; Steering Group (para. 44). These officials willcontinue to offer constructive guidance, as and when appropriate, and to helpmaintain the momentum of the Dockland project.19. The Government takes note of the Expenditure Committee&apos;s view thatall necessary powers should be delegated to the Joint Committee, and of the specific recommendation that the land acquisition and disposal functions ofthe Councils under the Community Land Bill, if enacted, should be so delegated.Initiative on the delegation of powers lies with the Joint Committee and its constituent authorities. The Government understands that they are alreadyconsidering how the local authorities&apos; responsibilities under the CommunityLand Bill should be operated in the Docklands area.Regional Employment PoliciesRecommendation 7 (Report: paragraph 57)20. The third main subject considered by the Committee was employment.The Committee recommended: &quot;that urgent consideration should be given to the large-scale provisionof retraining facilities in the general area of docklands&quot;.21. The Training Services Agency already has nearly 420 training places incolleges and employers&apos; establishments in the Docklands area and just under400 places at the Poplar Skillcentre. There are plans for another Skillcentre atDeptford which would provide about 340 more training places. Docklandsresidents can also be considered for training at other Skillcentres in London.Compared with the existing 1,900 training places at Skillcentres in London asa whole, the provision of some 740 places at Poplar and Deptford would amountto a substantial number of places in the Docklands area. In addition theTraining Services Agency is always prepared to consider opportunities for increasing the number of those training in colleges and employers&apos; establish-ments. Some 90 per cent of trainees are normally placed in their trades onsuccessful completion of their courses.Recommendation 8 (Report: paragraph 59)22. Recognising the importance of access to employment, the committee recommended: &quot;that steps should be taken to secure the early provision of better busand rail services and interchange facilities in order to improve access to employment&quot;.23. The Government accepts that early improvements to existing public transport services and the provision of better transport interchange facilities in and around the Docklands are needed, to widen the effective labour catchment
area for existing and prospective employers in Docklands and to offer to Dock-lands residents a wider range of job opportunities both within and outside their local areas.24. The responsibility for making specific recommendations for action,including in the short-term, rests initially with the Docklands Joint Committee.It has recognised the need for action. Proposals for making good some of theimmediate deficiencies of public transport in Docklands are outlined in a working paper &quot;Transport and Communications&quot; which has now been published. This will provide a basis for informed discussion of the problems and opportunities to remedy both the short-term and longer-term deficienciesof the area. The Joint Committee is expected to put firm proposals to theGreater London Council and the transport operators in the early autumn. the financing of particular schemes that are mutually agreed to have priority willbe handled within the framework of the Greater London CounciFs TransportPolicies and Programmes. These will provide the context for appraisal of anyresultant claims for grant-aid from Central Government.CONCLUSION25. The redevelopment of Docklands will take at least fifteen years to com-plete. The Joint Committee has been in being for just over a year and during that time has made good progress. However, many important decisions remain to be taken. The Expenditure Committee&apos;s report helps the Government andthe Joint Committee to see the way ahead and pinpoints some of the major problems to be overcome. The Department of the Environment will continueto keep in close touch with the Docklands Joint Committee and with theprogress of its work. Within the limits of the resources at its disposal, theGovernment will do all it can to help the redevelopment of Docklands to go forward with all speed.Printed in England for Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office by Harrison &amp; Sons (Hayes) Ltd.Dd 252819 K20 8/75ISBN 0 10 161930 8
