PREFACE1. The 1975 United Kingdom Memorandum to the Development assistance committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation andDevelopment is the sixth such Memorandum to be published with the objectof providing additional information about United Kingdom developmentassistance activities. The Memorandum covers activities in the calendar year1974 with special reference to aspects which the DAC regards as immediatelyrelevant to its purposes. Because the Memorandum has been provided primarily for purposes of international discussion, figures are expressed in dollars aswell as sterling.2. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, estab-lished by a Convention in Paris in December 1960, is the principal forum for consultations at both Ministerial and official levels on economic issues ofcommon interest to members, who comprise most of the European and otherdeveloped countries. Its work embraces broad aspects of the world economy and its aims include the promotion of policies contributing to sound economic expansion in non-member countries in the process of economic development.3. The Development Assistance Committee is one of the specialist com-mittees set up by OECD to achieve its aims. It is concerned with the volumeand effectiveness of resources made available to less developed countries.Members periodically review together the amount and the nature of their contributions to aid programmes, bilateral and multilateral, and consult on other relevant aspects of their development assistance policies. The Memo-randum now published is the current contribution by the United kingdom to this process of review.4. Participating in the work of the DAC are:Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France,Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden,Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States and the Commissionof the European Economic Communities. us. DAC members raised their net provision of Official Development Assist-ance (ODA) by 21 per cent in 1974 to $11-3 billion ($9-4 billion in 1973).This corresponded to 0-33 per cent of their combined GNP, compared with0-30 per cent in 1973. However, preliminary estimates suggest that prices of aid financed goods and services rose much faster than prices generally and,as a result, the increase of 21 per cent in ODA measured in dollars was equivalent to only a small increase in the volume of real resources transferred.6. A detailed statistical account of United Kingdom aid is provided in theannual publication &quot;British Aid Statistics&quot;.

introduction. Preliminary United Kingdom economic aid figures for 1974 show netofficial disbursements as $802 million ( 343m.) and gross disbursements as$905m. ( 387m.). The 1973 figures were $664m. ( 271m.) and $766m. ( 312m.)respectively. Official development assistance in 1974 was $722m. ( 309m.)net and $824m. ( 352m.) gross compared to $603m. ( 246m.) and $704m.( 287m.) respectively in 1973.2. In 1974 the United Kingdom sought to direct more of its bilateral aideffort towards meeting the needs of the poorest developing countries. 1975will see a further concentration on this group of countries, in relation to boththe quantity and the quality of the aid they receive.

It is a central objective of the United Kingdom&apos;s aid policy to give agreater emphasis to rural development.

Aid VolumeDisbursements4. In 1974 gross disbursements of official development assistance (includingvarious transactions not encompassed in the aid programme) totalled $824m.( 352m.). This together with other official flows (comprising certain Common-wealth Development Corporation disbursements, some of which may be financedunder the aid programme but not treated as official development assistance,and a number of miscellaneous grants that are classified as official flows to developing countries although not qualifying as official development assist-ance) total $905m. ( 387m.) compared with $766m. ( 312m.) in 1973.5. Net disbursements of official development assistance, that is, gross dis-bursements less amortization payments on past aid loans to developing countries, totalled $722m. ( 309m.) in 1974 compared with $603m. ( 246m.)in 1973. Net disbursements of total official flows were $802m. ( 343m.) in1974 as against $664m. ( 271m.) in 1973.6. The table below shows the breakdown of disbursements by type:		1973		1974			Sm	( m)	Sm	(fin)Gross Official Development Assistance:					Bilateral:					Financial grants       .....		104	(43)	112	(48)Financial loans        .....		261	(106)	321	(137)Technical Assistance		178	(73)	179	(76)Multilateral:					Financial Aid		131	(54)	182	(78)Technical Assistance ..      ..      .		30	(12)	31	(13)Gross Other Official Flows:					Bilateral grants ..      .....		51	(21)	55  ^	(24)CDC Investment (not qualifying as	Official				Development Assistance)		10	(4)	25	(11)Total Gross Disbursements		766	(312)	905	(387)Amortization    ..      .....		102	(41)	102	(44)Total Net Disbursements		664	(271)	802	(343)7. Gross disbursements of official development assistance in 1973/74 totalled$757m. ( 309m.); disbursements of net official development assistance were$658m. ( 268m.).8. In 1974-75 the estimated gross official development assistance disburse-ments were $819m. ( 350m.). The estimated net figure was $730m. ( 312m.).Commitments9. The United Kingdom programme is controlled on a disbursement basis and commitments are entered into and discharged at a rate intended to give,rise to the approved level of disbursements. The level of bilateral commitmentsat the end of 1973 was $642m. ( 262m.); at the end of 1974 it was $757m.
( 324m.). Total gross bilateral expenditure of aid against commitments during1974 was 8611m. ( 261m.). Multilateral commitments at the end of 1974totalled $306m. ( 131m.) compared to $143m. ( 58m.) at the end of 1973.New commitments of all categories of official development assistance were$1,063m. ( 454m.) in 1974 compared with $785m. ( 320m.) in 1973.10. Disbursement forecasts are reviewed during the course of each financialyear and steps are taken to control commitments and their discharge accordingto whether the forecasts are high or low. Methods of improving forecastingare continually being sought in order to achieve the fullest disbursement ofthe approved programme. In order to allow greater flexibility in managing the aid programme, the Ministry of Overseas Development may carry over up to 10m. of over-expenditure and up to  5m. (with the possibility of a further  5m.)under-expenditure from one year to the next.Geographical Distribution11. The table below shows the geographical distribution of gross bilateralofficial development assistance and other flows for the five years 1970-1974:	1970		1	971	1972		1973		1974		Sm	( m)	Sm	( m)	Sm	( m)	Sm	( m)	Sm	( m)Europe	34	(14)	42	(17)	31	(12)	24	(10)	18	(8)Africa	147	(61)	166	(68)	217	(87)	168	(69)	175	(75)America	49	(20)	71	(29)	62	(25)	62	(25)	70	(30)Asia	202	(84)	266	(109)	273	(109)	222	(90)	293	(125)Oceania	20	(8)	21	(9)	27	(11)	34	(14)	33	(14)Other	25	(11)	36	(15)	52	(21)	95	(39)	102	(44)Total	477	(199)	602	(247)	663	(265)	605	(247)	692	(296)In 1974, $61m. ( 26m.) or 9 per cent of the total bilateral flows, went to theleast developed group of countries; $290m. ( 124m.) or 42 per cent to themost seriously affected countries as defined by the UN; $377m. ( 161m.) or54 per cent to the group of countries with a GNP per head of less than $200;and $39m. ( 17m.) or 6 per cent went to OPEC countries, about half in theform of technical assistance.12. Fluctuations in the rate of annual disbursements to particular countriesdo not necessarily result from changes in policy towards them: annual disburse-ment levels are dependent on many factors and may vary from year to year.Prospects for 1975 onwards13. The aid programme estimates for the 1975/76 financial year are $1,132m.( 484m.) gross and $1,039m. ( 444m.) net. Because of the present economic difficulties in the United Kingdom, cuts have been imposed on public expendi-ture and the net aid programme has been reduced by $47m. ( 20m.) in 1974survey prices over the two financial years 1975-76 and 1976-77. After allowing for these changes, the gross aid programme for 1975-76 at current prices is$1,103m. ( 471-4m.) which is a substantial rise in cash terms over the anticipated outturn in 1974-75 of around $819m. ( 350m.). This could beexpected to produce calendar year gross disbursements in 1975 of about
$994m. ( 425m.). Estimated capital repayments in 1975 are $98m. ( 42m.)producing a likely net official disbursement figure against the aid programmeof about $896m. ( 383m.). Estimated receipts of interest in 1975 are $51m.( 22m.). The United Kingdom aid programme for 1977-78 to 1979-80 isbeing determined as part of the Governments review of all public expenditure.Aid and Effects of Inflation14. The annual White Papers on Public Expenditure indicate levels as thenplanned for the net aid programme over a five year period as part of the planning of public expenditure programme as a whole. The planning figures are on a constant price basis and are rolled forward each year by revaluationbased on estimated price changes in the year concerned for the economiccategories relevant to the programme. The United Kingdom system thereforehas a built-in adjustment for price changes to the forward planning figures,subject to changes in policy which may involve changes in the published figures.Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC)15. The CDC&apos;s investments increased during 1974 by a net amount of$53-6m. ( 22-9m.) to a total of $476-3m. ( 203-6m.). Investments in agri-culture, ranching and forestry, together with the allied processing plants,amounted to $110m. ( 47m.). Simplified arrangements for providing Exchequer,advances to the CDC on concessionary terms were introduced. The effectiverate of interest was unchanged and advances to the CDC for agriculturalprojects continued to carry an enhanced concessionary element.16. During 1974 Rwanda became the ninth non-Commonwealth country inwhich the CDC has been authorised to operate.Financial Terms and Conditions of Official Development Assistance (ODA)Terms of Aid Disbursed in 197417. Of the total of gross official development assistance and other officialdisbursements amounting to $905m. ( 387m.) in 1974, $555m. ( 237m.) or61 per cent was in grant or grant-like form (that is, including technical assistance and contributions to multilateral agencies); $226m. ( 97m.) or 25 per cent was as loans on interest-free terms; $42m. ( 18m.) or 5 per cent related to loansprovided at fixed concessionary rates of interest; $211,000 ( 90,000) or lessthan 0-03 per cent related to disbursements from earlier loans at market ratesof interest (including loans with interest waivers), and $81m. ( 35m.) or  per cent was in the form of overseas investment by the CDC. Overall theterms of government-to-government loans disbursed in 1974, omitting flowsthrough the CDC and debt reorganisation, provided a weighted average grantelement of 73-6 per cent.Terms of Aid Committed in 197418. The total value of new commitments of official development assistancein 1974 was $1,062m. ( 454m.), of which $580m. ( 248m.) or 55 per cent wasin grant form (including technical assistance taken to be the same as disburse-ments and contributions to multilateral agencies) and $483m. ( 206m.) wasin loans. Of the total value of new official development assistance loan commit-ments entered into during the year, 78 per cent was interest-free and 99-8 per
cent carried a grace period for capital repayments. The combined weightedgrant element of official development assistance loans was 69 per cent excludingdebt reorganisation. When taken together with grant commitments, the grantelement of the total was -S882m. ( 377m.) or 86 per cent of the commitments,excluding debt reorganisation.19. The bulk of loan commitments continued to be interest-free. Whereloans bear interest, it is at fixed concessionary rates ranging from 2 per cent to6 per cent. This pattern of loans provides flexibility in the terms of UnitedKingdom lending to those recipient countries for which interest bearing loansare considered appropriate, and gives the ability to harmonize the terms ofUnited Kingdom loans with those provided by other DAC members.The DAC Recommendation on Financial Terms and Conditions20. The United Kingdom complied in 1974 with the main objective containedin the DAC Terms Recommendation by attaining an average grant element of 86-4 per cent (against the target of at least 84 per cent) in its total officialdevelopment assistance commitments. The United Kingdom is also makingevery effort to attain the special target set in the Recommendation for aid tothe least developed countries which provides, inter alia, that the average grantelement of all official development assistance commitments from a donorshould be at least 86 per cent to each least developed country over a periodof three years (the first three-year period is 1973 to 1975 inclusive). Aidcommitments in 1974 to the least developed countries were made as a mixtureof interest-free loans and grants in order to meet this target.Criteria for Appropriate Terms and Conditions21. The basis of United Kingdom policy towards the terms of governmentto government aid loans continues to be one of adapting these terms to meetthe economic circumstances of the recipient country, taking especially intoaccount current and prospective income per head, as well as its balance ofpayments prospects. The terms of aid extended to the recipient country byother donor countries are also taken into account. This policy conforms to theDAC Recommendation on Financial Terms and Conditions in relating theterms of aid on a case by case basis to the circumstances of each developingcountry or group of countries. The policy has been followed regularly by theUnited Kingdom in consortia and consultative group discussions of the aid to be given to individual countries.22. As part of its policy of improving the quality of aid to the poorestdeveloping countries, the United Kingdom has decided that all its futureofficial development assistance commitments to developing countries with aper capita GNP of less than $200 and whose economic prospects are suchas not to warrant exclusion will be on grant terms. This decision will take effect with regard to new commitments made after 12 June 1975.Analysis of Refinancing and Consolidation Operations23. The major &quot;refinancing&quot; operation in the aid programme in 1974 asin the previous year was a further interest-free loan to India amounting toS22m. ( 9-4m.) to reimburse the Government of India for certain repayments of capital and interest made on a number of aid agreements dating from the
years 1958 to 1967. This refinancing was made available to the Government ofIndia as the United Kingdom&apos;s contribution towards a multilateral debt reliefscheme sponsored by the Aid India Consortium which was designed to alleviate the burden of debt servicing on the Indian balance of payments arising fromthe terms on which past aid loans were given. The effect of the scheme is to release the equivalent amount of free foreign exchange which can then beapplied to the purchase of essential imports, and it is considered to be oneof the most useful ways in which donors can help the development of thatcountry. The terms for the refinancing loan were those which the UnitedKingdom applied in 1974 to all its other official development financing toIndia, that is, interest-free with a maturity of 25 years and a seven-year graceperiod, giving a grant element of 77 per cent.24. Under an interim debt relief scheme sponsored by the Aid PakistanConsortium, the United Kingdom provided relief of $12m. ( 5-13m.) on debtservice payments falling due between 1 July 1973 and 30 June 1974. A nominalmoratorium interest rate of 1 per cent was charged on these rescheduled aidloan repayments. The scheme was a short term relief operation designed to alleviate Pakistani current balance of payments difficulties. Bilateral negotia-tions are taking place with both Pakistan and Bangladesh designed to implement a long-term debt relief scheme agreed multilaterally. Under this scheme, reliefwill be provided by DAC donors to Pakistan with an overall grant element of 62 per cent, and to Bangladesh with an overall grant element of 84 per cent.Procurement Policy25. Whilst the extent of procurement in a donor country which may result from the tying practices of that country is not fully revealed by statistics ofcontractually tied aid, the proportion of United Kingdom bilateral aid fullytied to United Kingdom goods and services in 1974 was 47 per cent (leavingout of account the cost of technical assistance). In addition to the procure-ment from this fully tied aid, further procurement in the United Kingdomarises from the considerable amount of bilateral financial aid tied to UnitedKingdom or local goods and services, the proportions of which are not alwayslaid down in advance in specific terms. The estimated percentage of furtherprocurement in the United Kingdom which results from such aid was 10 percent, giving an estimated total 57 per cent of bilateral aid effectively tied to united Kingdom procurement, without regard to any further procurementwhich may result from untied aid.26. Although United Kingdom bilateral aid is normally tied to the purchaseof British goods and services, the United Kingdom is ready, in the case of independent countries, to consider untying a limited part of its financial aid for meeting the local costs of projects in exceptional cases where this is judgedappropriate; for the United Kingdom Dependencies, the circumstances may require a greater proportion of the aid to be devoted to local costs or to localprocurement. Overall, therefore, the United Kingdom aid programme continuesto provide a substantial amount of flexibility in the treatment of local costs.For a number of countries, particularly the Dependencies, the West IndianAssociated States and independent countries in Southern Africa, waivers ofprocurement restrictions have been granted to allow procurement of specifiedcategories of goods from third countries in the light of the particular circum-
stances which applied. To facilitate the administration and use of tied aidsome foreign content, up to a maximum of 20 per cent, may be permitted.Budgetary aid, of which the United Kingdom provided $14m. ( 6m) in 1974,by its nature cannot be tied formally to overseas procurement; however, thearrangements with the recipient countries are that offshore procurementsupported by this budgetary aid will be from the United Kingdom, except where it would be clearly uneconomic to do so.27. As an additional measure to help the poorest developing countries, theUnited Kingdom has decided to untie its future official development assistanceloan commitments for procurement in developing countries with a per capitaGNP of less than $200, if the recipient country wishes such an arrangement to be made. This measure, which will be available from the last quarter of 1975,should provide an opportunity for the poorest developing countries to increase their export earnings and to stimulate inter-developing country trade.28. The United Kingdom continued to provide its financial contributions to multilateral institutions on procurement conditions in conformity with theunderstanding reached by all DAC member countries at the DAC High LevelMeeting in October 1973, that is, free for procurement in those countries thatare members or associate members of those institutions and if developed countries are recognised by the institutions concerned as significant contri-distributors and who are similarly observing the DAC understanding in the institutionconcerned.Aid Administration29. The structure of the Ministry of Overseas Development (ODM) con-tinued to be adapted to take account of changing needs:(a) as forecast in last year&apos;s report the new Disaster Unit was duly set upin June 1974 since when it has responded to emergencies in Bang-ladesh, Vietnam, Cyprus, Honduras, Somalia, Kenya, Pakistan,Mauritius, Mozambique, Rwanda and Lesotho;(b) plans were made (and implemented in early 1975), to convert AidPolicy Department into a Development Co-ordination Department asa further step towards an integrated approach to development co-ordination; and also to set up a Rural Development Department tohelp plan a greater concentration of the United Kingdom&apos;s aid pro-gramme on the relief of poverty especially in rural areas and to enableintegrated rural development projects to be developed;(c) there was a further concentration of the units arranging technical assistance in the field of education within the British Council;id) responsibility for consultation and, where appropriate, co-operationwith Voluntary Agencies over the range of their activities was centralisedin Social Affairs Department; and(e) it was decided to strengthen Middle East Development Division toenable it to advise on problems arising from the increased needs formanpower, training and other forms of technical assistance expected in the countries with rapidly growing wealth from oil.
Public and Parliamentary Opinion30. The trend towards more widespread public concern for the needs of developing countries, particularly noted in 1973, continued and increased in1974. Newspapers, radio and television continued to give good coverage todisaster situations, with follow-up stories on the Sahelian and Ethiopiandroughts. It was noted, however, that features on disasters (particularly those on television) were at last paying attention to the question of long term develop-ment. Several television and radio documentaries on Bangladesh devoted asubstantial part of their examination of the causes of poverty and hunger toan analysis of why there was a need, not just for immediate disaster relief, butfor overall development. Increased interest by the British media in developmentmatters led during the year to good coverage of the policies of the european economic Community (e.c.) towards less developed countries. PopulationYear, culminating in the Bucharest meeting, was well reported. But it was theWorld Food Conference that really captured the attention of both press and broadcasting, as well as the voluntary organisations. There was very widespreadcoverage and analysis of the world food situation, which in turn led to attentionbeing drawn to the problems of development.31. The outcome of increased interest by the news media, and the campaignson world hunger and food shortages mounted by the voluntary agencies, wasa torrent of letters to MPs, Ministers and ODM, urging the Government tostep up its aid effort, and asking for information about what was already being done. It was clear from the many letters received that there is a new-degree of awareness among the public of the problems of the developing world.ODM is building on this to establish a concern for the need for long termcommitment to development programmes. However, public education aboutdevelopment has still a long way to go. Parliamentary Questions by MPsabout aid increased from 182 in 1973 to 224 in 1974 and it was clear that therewas more critical interest in the subject on the part of Parliamentarians. TheHouse of Commons Select Committee on Overseas Development havingcompleted its enquiry into the impact of oil price rises on developing countries,and the implications thereof for British overseas development policy as mentioned in paragraph 4 of the United Kingdom&apos;s previous memorandum, isnow undertaking an enquiry into &quot;The Food Crisis and Third World Develop-ment: Implications for United Kingdom Policy&quot;.32. While ODM publicity material was an invaluable source for organisedgroups, for schools, colleges and higher education, and for the casual enquirer,it was clear from ordinary public reaction that, first television, then radio and newspapers, are powerful elements in creating public understanding of thedevelopment problem, and public sympathy for the provision of aid. It has there fore been the increasing aim of ODM to cultivate interest in the develop-ment issue among those in the media who commission and select currentaffairs features.33. ODM&apos;s information work in 1974 continued along similar lines to thatof the previous year, but with slightly increased activity. During the year230 general press releases covering all aspects of ODM&apos;s work were issued;as well as 210 others, addressed to particular news outlets, publicising appoint-ments under the technical assistance programme. A new series of folders about
individual developing countries, describing the people, the economy, and how the country can be assisted by aid from outside, have been widely distributed.Distribution to teacher training colleges, educational authorities, and schools,continued at a high rate throughout the year. A second edition of an illustratedfolder for schools (but which is also of value to the ordinary public) wasproduced and 40,000 copies distributed. The production of the ODM newspaper&quot;Overseas Development&quot; was improved during the year, and its circulationmoved in excess of 10,000 copies an issue. The colour film commissioned byODM on agriculture and general development, first shown in 1973, entered the Central Film Library, and Welsh and Scottish equivalents, in 1974 and was seen by well over 300 different audiences. Sets of 30 slides covering agriculture,health, education and industry in developing countries proved to be popularwith lecturers and teachers throughout Britain.Activities by the Voluntary Agencies34. The aid constituency in the country continued to grow in strength during1974. It was to be found in the universities, in the Churches, in the large voluntaryfund-raising organisations, and in the many associations and groups in Britainconcerned with hunger, poverty, general development, and with particularsectoral interests such as the environment and the general spread of inter-national understanding. Of particular importance were the groups formedamong students and other young people. The main fund-raising agencies have -operated with the ODM in support of educational work through the voluntary Committee on Overseas Aid and Development (VCOAD); thisCommittee also continued to serve as a Secretariat for the Standing Conferenceon the Second Development Decade, which is an association of some 70 organi-sations, representing almost every aspect of national, regional, and institutionallife in Britain, who have undertaken to promote the study among their membersof developmental and Third World issues.Aid for Social PurposesPopulation Policy35. Following the adoption of the World Population Plan of Action (WPPA)by the World Population Conference at Bucharest in August 1974, to whichthe United Kingdom gave its full support, the United Kingdom populationaid policy was reviewed and in consequence the United Kingdom contributions to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities are being increased from $2-3m. ( lm.) in 1974-75 to  4-2m. ( 1-8) in 1975-76 and to theInternational Planned Parenthood Federation from $l-6m. ( 700,000) in1974-75 to $2-8m. ( l-2m.) in 1975-76. At the same time, United KingdomMissions in developing countries were invited to consider whether there were any opportunities for making known the United Kingdom&apos;s desire to provideassistance, if necessary, over and above the level of aid already agreed, tohelp to secure a better understanding of the problems of population change and its relevance to economic and social development.36. Following these initiatives and an earlier one in 1974, there has been aconsiderable increase of interest in United Kingdom aid for population mattersby developing countries. There is little doubt that the events of World Popula-tion Year have played a major part in focusing attention on the vital importance
which population change has on development. The adoption by consensus ofthe WPPA at the Bucharest Conference has stimulated many governments intogiving serious consideration to introducing measures called for in that docu-ment. The implications of providing all persons with the knowledge and means to enable them to control their own fertility are very far reaching, and certainlythe cost is well beyond the means of many of the poorer countries. nevertheless the aim of universal responsible parenthood, and the recognition of the rightof all persons to be able to control their own fertility, are now accepted bythe international community and the United Kingdom stands firmly behindits pledge that it will do all it can to assist with action programmes intendedto achieve the implementation of the WPPA.Technical AssistanceAppraisal, Review and Evaluation37. The work reported in paragraph 41 of last year&apos;s report on improvedappraisal and evaluation has now largely been embodied in a new chapterof the ODM&apos;s manual of procedure.Recruitment of Operational Personnel and Advisers38. During 1974 bilateral appointments made under the auspices of ODMto advisory and operational posts under various bilateral technical assistancearrangements totalled 2,197 (compared with 2,272 in 1973). This figure includes,for the Education Sector, 615 school teachers and 133 teacher trainers. TheCouncil for Technical Education and Training for Overseas Countries (TETOC)made 89 operational appointments (75 in 1973), and the British Council210 operational appointments (254 in 1973). In other sectors the Crown agents for Oversea Governments and Administrations made, on behalf of ODM,200 operational appointments (228 in 1973). Appointments to international organisations, including the United Nations, were 223 (206 in 1973).39. A shortage of suitable candidates in some disciplines (including teachertrainers, fisheries staff, veterinary officers, foresters, agricultural economists,pasture experts and mining and electrical engineers) continues to cause someconstraint on recruitment, particularly for operational posts. Continuing efforts are made to identify the reasons for these shortages and where possible remediesare being applied. One of the main reasons appears to be a fear of unemploy-ment on return from service abroad; to meet this, consideration is being givento a possible expansion of the Home Base Scheme so that more appointmentscan be made &quot;on secondment&quot; from home institutions. The question ofin-service and post-service training facilities for technical assistance personnelis also being re-examined as a recruitment incentive. Salaries and salary supple-ments are now reviewed annually and some fringe benefits, including medicalbenefits for supplemented staff and their families, have been improved.The Future Supply of Operational Staff&apos;40. ODM reviewed the schemes under which salary supplements and other benefits are paid to operational personnel employed by overseas governments and other institutions. It was agreed that supplementation schemes shouldcontinue to be available to overseas governments when the current agreementsend on 31 March 1976. Manpower reviews are undertaken annually to ensurethat expatriate manpower is provided on the basis of a country&apos;s developmental
needs; more attention will in future be given to evaluating the success of these arrangements in relation to the joint objectives of the United Kingdom andot the recipient Government.Volunteers41. The Member Societies of the British Volunteer Programme, namely the catholic Institute for International Relations (CIIR), International voluntary service (IVS), the United Nations Association (UNA) and Voluntary service overseas (VSO), continued to recruit volunteers for service overseas in response to requests from developing countries. Official government financial supporttotalling $2-2m. ( 926,000) was provided, while the British Council acted asOverseas Arm for the administration of the programme in most countries.42. The number of graduate and similarly qualified volunteers in post at31 December 1974 was 1,215, compared with the 1973 figure of 1,631. Thecadet programme, which now comprises mainly semi-qualified young people,had dwindled from 31 volunteers in 1973 to none by 31 December 1974 asthe demand from developing countries is now almost exclusively for qualifiedpersonnel. The Societies are therefore not making any positive efforts to recruitunqualified volunteers.43. About three-fifths of the volunteers are teachers while the rest are engaged mainly in nursing, agriculture, engineering and community develop-ment. Demand is continuing to increase for technical volunteers rather than for secondary school teachers (other than in the fields of English, mathematics,science, and vocational subjects) and also for older and more experiencedpersonnel.Training44. The level of intake of new arrivals for training in the United kingdom during 1974 under the various regional technical assistance training programmeswas 3,800, as compared with 3,900 in 1973 and 3,300 in 1972. In addition an estimated 530 people came to the United Kingdom during 1974 for courses inteacher training and teacher administration under the Commonwealth Educa-tion Fellowship Scheme as compared with 524 in 1973 and 551 in 1972. Thetotal number of people who received training in the United Kingdom financedbilaterally from public funds during 1974 was 14,700 as compared with 14,450during 1973.45. Consultations with overseas governments with the object of ensuring thatrequests for training in the United Kingdom are related as closely as possibleto the overall manpower requirements of the countries concerned continue onan annual basis. With the object of monitoring the extent to which performanceunder the training programmes in the United Kingdom matches the intentionsagreed in these discussions, steps are being taken on an experimental basis to accumulate data, country by country, identifying the Ministry or other employerof individual trainees.Research and Development46. With the general aim of attacking poverty and increasing agricultural production, the United Kingdom has continued to support an extensive pro-
gramme of scientific and technical research and development with the needsof the developing countries in view. Parts of this programme are entrusted to government establishments in the United Kingdom which receive long-termsupport from the ODM; other parts are contracted out to universities or other institutions. In either case the work may take place overseas, or in the UnitedKingdom, or partly in each: co-operative research in partnership with overseasinstitutions is particularly welcome and valuable.47. Some of the scientific and technical investigations funded by the ODMare carried out at the request of particular countries on problems wholly or mainly specific to themselves. The cost of such investigations is normally met from the &quot;country&quot; programmes of technical assistance administered by theODM. Other investigations concern problems which are global or regionalin their scope or, if at present the concern of a single country, of clear potentialrelevance to other countries or regions. Investigations of this kind may stemfrom proposals from governments or institutions overseas or from sourcessuch as the specialist staff of the ODM (who travel extensively overseas).Their cost is met not from &quot;country&quot; programmes but from a central allocation of research and development funds amounting to $11-8m. ( 5-lm.) in 1974 an increase of $455,000 ( 194,000) over 1973.48. The ODM supports scientific and technical research and assistance in anumber of other ways. Its contributions to the International agricultural research Centres (see paragraph 58 below) amounted to $2-2m. ( 961,000)in 1974. The cost of ODM&apos;s Special Units (which include the Tropical ProductsInstitute, the Centre for Overseas Pest Research and the Land ResourcesDivision) amounted to $3-8m. ( l-6m.) in 1974; a substantial portion of this sum was spent on research and development work, the rest being used for field operations, training of overseas personnel and the dissemination of scientific and technical information. Finally the ODM makes annual grants,which totalled $427,000 ( 183,000) in 1974, to the Institute of GeologicalSciences, the Centre for Tropical Veterinary Medicine and the NationalInstitute of Agricultural Engineering to support the programme of thosebodies in, or on behalf of, the developing countries. A fuller account of theODM&apos;s research and development activities is contained in the Ministry&apos;s&quot;Report on Research and Development, 1974&quot;: this report was the first in anew series; subsequent reports will follow annually.49. Research connected with renewable natural resources continues to be a major field of effort. The research supported has substantial tropical agricultureand pest control components and also includes work under the followingclassifications: trypanosomiasis (a separate section), veterinary, fisheries and forestry. Project support in which the United Kingdom collaborates with overseas countries on particular research projects continues to be promoted.For example in Ghana a team of seven British scientists is carrying out research on breeding of cocoa varieties resistant to swollen shoot disease; in Mexicoa team is engaged in research aimed at the development of shrimp fisheries in the coastal lagoons and a team of scientists is investigating animal virusand protozoal diseases at the East African Veterinary Research Organisation.50. The ODM calls upon the help of many United Kingdom universitydepartments and on the expertise of the research stations of the Agricultural
Research Council (ARC). The ODM has built and maintains a Tsetse research laboratory at the University of Bristol where colonies of flies are bred forfundamental research on the control of trypanosomiasis and research into thebehavioural patterns of tsetse flies is carried out. Research is also carried outin the United Kingdom and overseas institutions with the flies supplied fromthis Laboratory. At Reading University research is being carried out in collaboration with the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture in nigeria on the physiology of grain legumes.51. Outside the research subhead, funds continued to be provided in 1974 tomaintain a number of scientific and technical organisations specialisingexclusively in the natural resources problems of developing countries. Of these,the Tropical Products Institute, the Centre for Overseas Pest Research and theLand Resources Division are all functional components of ODM.52. The Tropical Products Institute (TPI) is concerned with post-harvesthandling, processing, quality control and storage of the products of renewablenatural resources, with local and overseas markets for them, and with industriesbased on them. Marketing and industrial feasibility studies on a wide range of tropical products have been reported, and investigations into the control of quality of fruits and vegetables have been continued. In line with the prioritycurrently placed on assisting rural development the TPI has recently set up a rural Food Technology Advisory Group to identify needs of rural areas in less developed countries for assistance in the field of food technology (postharvest) and to suggest ways of meeting these needs. A Renewable Fuels Sectionhas recently been formed to look into the question of alternative fuel sources in the developing countries particularly at the rural village level.53. The Centre for Overseas Pest Research (COPR) helps developing countries to solve pest problems in the fields of agriculture and public health.Investigation and research, including research into pesticides residues in tropicalsoils, and work on the development and application of modern techniques ofpest control are undertaken. Other work includes anti-locust and termiteresearch. The Centre also provides scientific information, advice and training.54. The Land Resources Division (LRD) assesses land resources for develop-ing countries for the development of agriculture, livestock and forestry inco-operation with the governments of the countries concerned. It also trainsnationals from developing countries in the techniques of land resource appraisal.55. The Centre for Tropical Veterinary Medicine (CTVM) conducts research in the United Kingdom and countries overseas into problems related to tropicalveterinary medicine and animal health, and provides facilities for trainingUnited Kingdom and overseas post-graduate students in these fields.56. At the National Institute of Agricultural Engineering (NIAE) an overseas department is maintained to provide a technical service on all matters con-nected with agricultural engineering overseas. In particular the departmentinvestigates low-cost labour intensive techniques, and designs and developsagricultural tools and equipment suitable for use in developing countries,especially implements of a relatively simple kind.
57. A subvention of $47,000 ( 20,000) was given to the CommonwealthForestry Institute in 1974 to support work in tropical forestry, particularlytropical silviculture.58. Support for International Research Centres under the aegis of the consultative Group for International Agricultural Research was continued forthe International Rice Research Institute, the International Institute of TropicalAgriculture, the International Potato Centre and the International Centre forAgricultural Research in the Semi-arid Tropics; and in addition, ODM con-tributed to the programmes of the International Maize and Wheat ImprovementCentre and the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture; and to funds to set up the International Livestock Centre for Africa, the InternationalLaboratory for Research in Animal Diseases and the International PlantGenetic Resources Board. These commitments resulted in total payments of$2-2m. ( 961,000) in 1974. Support for all these Centres is continuing in 1975.59. The scientific and technical work funded by ODM in fields other thanthose of renewable natural resources is largely concerned with &quot;infrastructure&quot; the physical pre-conditions for development such as adequate maps, water supplies and roads and with human, social and economic problems the fight against disease, the encouragement of industries and technologies appropriate to developing country conditions, and the expansion of employment.60. Mapping is a basic necessity for all planning and national development programmes and the ODM has continued to assist overseas governments inthis field through the medium of the Directorate of Overseas Surveys (a SpecialUnit of ODM). Comparable assistance in the equally important field ofgeological mapping and investigation is provided through the Overseas Divisionof the Institute of Geological Sciences.61. The development of water resources overseas is an area to which theUnited Kingdom has been giving a high priority in view of its self-evidentimportance for agricultural production and community life. To this end anOverseas Division was set up in 1974 at the Institute of Hydrology with financeprovided by ODM to enable the Institute to develop its existing field workon behalf of overseas countries. A post of Hydrogeological Adviser to theODM was established at the Institute of Geological Sciences to completeODM&apos;s professional coverage of the scientific disciplines concerned with waterresources. The Hydraulics Research Station, at which an Overseas Division was set up in 1973 with ODM support, has embarked on a research and development programme to help rural communities to make the most of the water resources;it includes such topics as the design of tubewells and minor irrigation systems and the use of small inflatable dams.62. As with water resources, so in the field of road and building constructionthe ODM works through existing technical institutions of the United KingdomGovernment in this case the Transport and Road Research Laboratory andthe Building Research Establishment. The general aim of work in these andother fields is to adapt existing technologies to the circumstances of countrieswhich are tropical and under-developed, for example, by putting the emphasis on the labour-intensive rather than the labour-saving, and on the simple ratherthan the complex. Special emphasis is also given in the overseas programmes of these and other establishments supported by the ODM to projects of direct
relevance to the problems of poor communities, in particular in rural areas.The technical programmes of the Overseas Divisions of the Transport and road research Laboratory and the Building Research Establishment are thusincreasingly concerned with specific problems of low-cost roads and low-costbuilding (especially housing).63. The general aim of promoting technologies appropriate to developingcountry conditions runs through the programmes of all the scientific establish-ments financed by ODM. In addition ODM has commissioned a specificresearch project from Strathclyde University into the costs and benefits of using &quot;intermediate technology&quot; techniques in connection with various types of production and distribution processes in developing countries. ODM hasalso started to provide grant assistance for a four-year period to support thework of the Industrial Liaison Unit of the Intermediate Technology Develop-ment Group (a voluntary organisation with charitable status).64. The United kingdom&apos;s  long-standing support for tropical medical research has continued, with special reference to parasitic diseases and mal-nutrition. While much of the work funded relates to a deeper scientific under-standing of particular conditions, increasing emphasis has been placed on thedevelopment of cheap and simple methods of treatment and on preventingdisease by achieving higher standards of public health. The United Kingdomcontributed $249,000 ( 106,000) in 1974 to the international control programme in West Africa for onchocerciasis (river blindness) and has also made a specialcontribution of $87,700 ( 37,500) to the WHO smallpox eradication campaign,which now appears to be well within sight of final success.Technical Co-operation with Oil Rich States65. The rise in oil prices in 1973-74, with its consequent vast increase inthe scale and accelerated pace of the development programmes of the oil-richcountries, has led to a correspondingly large increase in their demands on the developed countries of the West for technical expertise of all kinds boththrough the supply of skilled people and the provision of training. This demand is being met through a diversity of channels, both public and private, and theODM&apos;s role, though important, by no means attempts to cover the wholefield. It seems likely that its role will largely develop not through the provisionof technical assistance directly by ODM on reimbursement, but rather throughthe ODM facilitating or co-ordinating arrangements made by overseas govern-ments directly with official or semi-official agencies in the United kingdom which can help with staff supply and training. At the same time ODM, whilecontributing constructively in this way to the dialogue with the oil producers,has an obligation to ensure that technical assistance on payment should notpre-empt institutional and manpower resources which are required to help theneedier developing countries.Private SectorPrivate Investment66. The United Kingdom remains an investor on a large scale in the develop-ing world. The contribution of private investment to the flow of resources
from the United Kingdom to developing countries over the last few years has been as follows: NET PRIVATE INVESTMENT			Share of total for all			overseas countries	Sm	 m	/o1971........	236	101	121972 ......      . .	278	119	91973 ........	133	59	4The estimates for individual years should be treated with considerable reserve in attempting to deduce trends; the various elements which make up the total figure for net private investment fluctuate considerably from year to year.67. It is of course for developing countries to make their own arrangementsfor private investment, according to their own assessment of their needs and priorities. For this reason and as it can be argued that private investment shouldnot be regarded as aid, ODM has terminated the Pre-Investment Studies Scheme,whereby financial support was given to feasibility studies by United Kingdomprivate investors in developing countries. However, if the government of adeveloping country asks for help with a particular study this is considered onits merits under normal technical assistance arrangements.//; vestment Protection68. The United Kingdom seeks wherever possible to conclude bilateralinvestment protection agreements with other countries for the reciprocalprotection of investments. The United Kingdom believes that such agreementshelp to secure fair treatment of private investment overseas and agreements were negotiated with Singapore and Egypt in December 1974 and March 1975respectively. Negotiations are continuing with a number of other countries.Investment Insurance69. The Exports Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) continues to insurenew investment from the United Kingdom against the non-commercial risks ofwar, expropriation and restrictions on remittances. By the end of 1974 ECGDhad concluded 55 insurance agreements under the scheme relating to 27 projects in Africa, six in Central America, two in South America, 14 in the Far East,four in the Middle East, and one each in Europe and Oceania.Export Credits Guarantee Department70. The net amount of credit in excess of 180 days in length extended tothe developing countries in 1974 was $355m. ( 151-5m.), compared with anet total of $281m. ( 114-6m) in 1973. The total net value of credit extendedto all countries was $764m. ( 326 - 4m.) in 1974; net credit to developing countriesrepresents 46 per cent of this total.71. The only significant change in ECGD facilities during the year was theintroduction of a flexible interest scheme for business in excess of five yearssupported by ECGD financing. The rate for such business could be determinedby ECGD in the light of the particular circumstances of each case between
a range of 6-8^ per cent per annum. Following international agreement later in the year this was replaced by a minimum rate of 1\ per cent per annum.The minimum rate for business between two and five years was 7 per cent andfor business below two years remained at \ per cent above the relevant bank&apos;sbase rate.72. ECGD has also taken part during the year in negotiations between the member states of the e.c., Japan and the USA towards the concluding of aGentlemen&apos;s Agreement aimed at determining the maximum lengths of credit and minimum interest rates for different groups of markets.73. Whilst there are not normally any direct consultations on debt servicingbetween ECGD and the authorities of the importing countries, ECGD controls the volume of United Kingdom private credit to developing countries byassessing the situation of the recipient country based, inter alia, on the overallamount of external debt to be serviced, and it is a standard ECGD requirement that any regulation of the recipient country (such as prior approval/registration of credits) must be complied with. ECGD may also stipulate that a guarantee of payment and/or sterling availability should be obtained from the CentralFinancing Authorities of the importing country to ensure that proper provision is made for payment of the contract; and in addition, projects worth over$4-7m. ( 2m.) in a limited number of developing countries are assessed asto their viability and developmental value before ECGD cover is agreed.However, debt management is primarily the responsibility of the borrower.Use of Consultants74. British consultants continue through their work overseas, both com-mercially and under aid arrangements, to play an important part in helping to formulate development plans. In 1974 total technical assistance expenditurein respect of the services of consultants and other organisations in undertakingfeasibility and other pre-investment investigations, and in the provision ofother kinds of management, operational and advisory services, was $12-16m.( 5-2m.).75. 104 new feasibility and pre-investment studies were commissionedduring the year at an estimated total cost of $6-4m. ( 2-6m.) compared with91 new assignments in 1973 also with an estimated cost of $6-4m. ( 2-6m.).In addition 43 projects other than for feasibility or pre-investment purposeswere initiated totalling some $l-2m. ( 500,000) compared with 45 projectsvalued at $2-9m. ( l-2m.) in the previous year. The principal fields coveredwere irrigation and water supplies, agriculture, mining, oil and minerals,transportation and roads, and power.76. A project of particular interest, since it foreshadowed the current ODMemphasis on rural development, is the scheme in the Tigre Province of Ethiopiawhere extremely low rainfall is the primary constraint on agricultural develop-ment. Phase I, started in May 1974, identified problems and showed that thegreatest potential for improvement was in rain-fed agriculture and, to a lesser extent, in irrigation. The programme for Phase II will concentrate on estab-lishing two Rural Development Units with the aim of stabilising a deterioratingagricultural situation by initiating rehabilitation and long term agricultural development. The project is in line with the IBRD&apos;s overall strategy for the area.
Private Non-Profit Bodies77. The United Kingdom has made important changes in its workingrelations with voluntary agencies.78. The Disaster Unit established in ODM with the aim of improving itsability to respond quickly and effectively to disaster situations in developing countries is represented on the Disasters Emergency Committee, which bringstogether the main British voluntary agencies, and has worked closely with them,exchanging information on an informal basis about disaster or potentialdisaster situations and consulting about action to be taken. In a number ofcases joint relief operations have been mounted: the Unit arranged and paid for a charter plane to send a consignment of Red Cross milk powder to Rwanda;it met the cost of transporting certain relief supplies sent by voluntary agenciesto Cyprus; and it has worked very closely with the Disasters Emergency Committee over their programme of emergency assistance to Vietnam to whichODM made a contribution of $580,000 ( 250,000).79. Preparatory work was also completed on a scheme, which will comeinto effect in 1975 for part-funding of development projects undertaken overseasby voluntary agencies. Briefly, the scheme, which will be financed out of the aid programme, is intended to assist projects which are developmental andinnovative, which involve local people and resources, and which aim to makelife better for the poorest. Assistance will be given to projects varying in valuebetween 87,000 ( 3,000) and $117,000 ( 50,000).80. During the year the United Kingdom continued to help finance a rural development advisory team which a British agency is maintaining in Zaire.It also contributed to a number of family health and welfare programmes run by agencies overseas. Expenditure in all totalled about $304,000 ( 130,000)from official funds. In addition, official funds supported the British VolunteerProgramme which is run by voluntary agencies.81. The agencies themselves, some 200 of them including church andmissionary societies, provided approximately $61m. ( 26m.) in grants for development work overseas in 1974. About 75 per cent of this money was provided by 19 agencies. Their funds were mainly spent on agriculture, health and nutrition and education projects in over 70 developing countries, thoughemergency relief continued to make demands on their resources.Other Aspects of Co-operation PolicyTariff Matters82. The United Kingdom has continued to work for improvements to theGeneral Preference Scheme (GSP) of the e.c. with particular reference to agriculture sector and emphasis on the exports of those developing countries that are not covered by preferential arrangements. The e.c. is committed toimprove its GSP progressively, taking particular account of the interest ofthe poorest developing countries. The United Kingdom hopes that progress will be made in the multilateral trade negotiations with special measures infavour of developing countries in accordance with the 1973 MinisterialDeclaration at Tokyo. The e.c. Directive for these negotiations makes specific provision for developing countries, in particular the least developed among them.
Commodity Questions83. The United Kingdom fully recognises the importance of commoditytrade in the development co-operation context and the need to promote measuresof stability.84. At the Kingston Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting inApril/May 1975 the United Kingdom Prime Minister proposed the creationof a general agreement on commodities which would serve to complement theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and would outline thefollowing general commitments:(a) the interdependence of producers and consumers and the desirabilityof conducting trade in commodities in accordance with equitablearrangements worked out in agreement between producers and con-sumers should be recognised:(b) producer countries should undertake to maintain adequate and securesupplies to consumer countries;(c) consumer countries for their part should undertake to improve access to markets for those items of primary production of interest to develop-ing producers;(rf) the principle should be established that commodity prices should beequitable to consumers and remunerative to efficient producers andat a level which would encourage long-term equilibrium betweenproduction and consumption;(e) in particular the need to expand the total production of essential foodstuffs should be recognised;(/) the efficient development, production and marketing of commodities the diversification and efficient processing of commodities in developing countries should be encouraged.85. He also proposed a number of specific measures which might givepractical effect to these principles, which were remitted, together with others,to a Commonwealth Working Party for further study. The OECD and the eec are also studying this problem. The United Kingdom is also participating in the on-going work in international fora concerned with commodity trade the GATT, the FAO and the UNCTAD. In so far as individual commodities are concerned, the United Kingdom will play its part in the negotiations forthe new agreements in prospect for coffee, cocoa, tin and wheat. As a resultof the completion of successor arrangements to the Commonwealth sugar agreement, developing Commonwealth Sugar Producers will receive continuingaccess to the e.c. at a guaranteed price for up to 1 - 4 million tons of sugarper year.Restructuring of Industry86. The United Kingdom can accept adjustment assistance in the light ofUnited Kingdom economic circumstances but is not in favour of it in anticipa-tion of changes in production in developing countries. Industry in the UnitedKingdom makes its own adjustment decisions as part of a continuing process
of development and change which takes account of import penetration actuallyachieved by developing countries as well as a whole range of other factors.The Government takes steps to assist this process in the light of the UnitedKingdom&apos;s economic circumstances. There are generous depreciation allow-ances for tax purposes on a national level, and a generous system of regionalincentives exists to encourage the development of new industries in the assisted areas to replace jobs lost in declining industries. Selective financial assistancecan also be given throughout the country and is used to help particular sectors of industry on a national basis. The National Enterprise Board, which is tobe set up under legislation currently before Parliament, will have the means to establish new industrial enterprises, to assist the development of existingenterprises, and to promote reorganisation within industry.Developing Countries Import Opportunities Office (DCIOO)87. DCIOO was established in December 1973 within the London Chamberof Commerce and Industry and is financed by ODM. It provides information and advice to help developing countries expand their exports to the UnitedKingdom and it handled nearly 2,000 enquiries in its first nine months of full operation up to December 1974. The Office works in close liaison withthe ODM&apos;s Tropical Products Institute and has established good contact withthe GATT/UNCTAD International Trade Centre in Geneva, which the UnitedKingdom supports through its Liaison Office, programmes of visits and trainingon behalf of developing countries.Food Aid88. The basic United Kingdom reserves about food aid as a developmentaltool remain, specially in so far as disincentives to local production and limita-tion on recipients choice are concerned. But it recognises that in the shortterm for emergency and humanitarian reasons it is often essential to helpmeet short-falls arising from natural and man-made disasters.89. Against this background, the United Kingdom has supported a furtherone year renewal of the Food Aid Convention and continuation of the EECsdairy products programmes and participated in a number of additionalemergency actions:(a) bilaterally in so far as Somalia was concerned;(b) through the eec&apos;s contributions to the United Nations emergency measures which were used by some countries for the purchase and/ortransport of food;(c) through its contribution to the World Food Programme.These emergency actions have cost the United Kingdom in excess of $14m.( 6m.). In addition the United Kingdom spent $44m. ( 19m.) in 1974 on national and e.c. food aid programmes and in regular pledges to the world food Programme.90. Since there are likely to continue to be acute shortages of food in some parts of the world, the United Kingdom supported the call made at the world food Conference for a substantial increase in food aid and has supportedproposals brought forward within the e.c. for a 25 per cent increase in spending
in 1975, involving increased tonnages of cereals and of dried skimmed milk.The long-term solution must lie in agricultural and rural development but theUnited Kingdom believes that increased food aid commitments will be requiredin parallel in the immediate future.91. In distributing this food aid the United Kingdom believes that great caremust be taken(a) to ensure that it is distributed to those countries which need aid most,without entering into pluri-annual commitments on a country basis;(b) to ensure that the commodities provided have the maximum nutritionaleffect and imply no health risks (of the kind presented by the un-controlled distribution of dried skimmed milk that might be used asa baby food); and(c) to ensure that local sales do not depress local production.Largely as a result of United Kingdom pressure, the e.c. has increasinglymoved towards a more satisfactory distribution of its own food aid programmeswith the result that 70 per cent now goes to the populous and poor countries of South Asia.92. The United Kingdom has supported the World Food Programme since its inception. Pledges for the calendar biennium 1971-72 and 1973-74 were%3-6m. ( l-53m.) and $5-9m. ( 2-5m.) respectively, and for the 1975-76biennium a total of $19-6m. ( 8-825m.) has been promised. In the UnitedKingdom&apos;s view the free distribution of food aid in the manner practised bythe World Food Programme offers the most successful way of using food aid for humanitarian and developmental purposes. The World Food programme has gained considerable experience in the distribution of food aid and theUnited Kingdom strongly advocates greater use being made of this experience and organisation by more food aid being channelled through the Programme.93. The total cost to the United Kingdom of food aid in 1974 was approxi-mately 344m. ( 19m.) of which !?23-4m. ( 10m.) was disbursed through the eec channel on Community cereals and dairy products; $16-8m. ( 7-2m.)was disbursed on the United Kingdom national actions contained within theCommunity programmes; and $3-6m. ( l-5m.) in multilateral aid, mainly tothe World Food Programme.II. AID ALLOCATIONS IN THE LIGHT OF CHANGINGREQUIREMENTS94. Changes in the pattern of geographical distribution of any donor&apos;s aid programme are inevitably slow. Save in exceptional circumstances, suddenchanges in the level of aid to particular recipients are inherently undesirable.The recipient reasonably expects stability of flows, and indeed any one donorwould have difficulty in planning its own aid programme rationally if it couldnot depend on a certain stability in the pattern of flows from other donors.
In the case of the United Kingdom historic links are a major factor in deter-mining the existing pattern of aid distribution. Commonwealth ties and particularresponsibilities in certain areas manifestly shape its programme and willcontinue to be a major influence. Apart from political ties, considerations of efficiency alone would suggest that it is appropriate for donors, especially the major ones, to continue to be the dominant donors in relation to specificrecipients.95. The arguments against rapid change in the distribution of aid, and indeed the practical difficulties which stand in its way, make it all the moreimportant that the opportunities at the margin for redeployment of aid resources should be used to move these in the right direction. It is widely acknowledgedthat the accidents of history have left world aid programmes very poorlydistributed in relation to the poverty of the recipients. Typically the countries with less income per head receive less aid per head. The policy of the UnitedKingdom is to press through bilateral and multilateral action for this situation to be improved as rapidly as possible.96. Accordingly, in modifying the direction of the United Kingdom aid programme the first major consideration is the level of aid receipts per capitafrom all sources in relation to the income level. Significant expected changes inrelative income levels are also taken into account. Aid receipts from otherdonors are estimated on the basis of existing patterns together with any available information on likely changes. Flows from OPEC donors have now become a significant consideration to be allowed for. Difficulties in absorbing aid foruseful purposes can be a factor reducing aid programmes to individual countries from otherwise desirable levels, though more generally it can be an argument for giving aid in the form of technical assistance rather than capital aid. Shortor medium term improvement in the balance of payments position of a recipient,implying that aid will effectively be used to build up reserves, can also be a reason for diverting capital aid to equally poor alternative recipients, at leasttemporarily, while showing due regard to the need for stability in aid relation-ships. Good long run balance of payments prospects will normally be associatedwith good income prospects and will be taken into account under that heading.Similarly, weak balance of payments prospects in the longer run, includingproblems arising from debt obligations, are normally only taken into accountthrough their impact on income prospects.97. Short term adverse balance of payments prospects are normally dis-regarded as an influence on aid distribution. However, those most seriously affected by recent international economic trends were at least initially largelythose very poor countries who were already identified as seriously under-aided.The short term difficulties only compounded their poor long term prospects.The United Kingdom accordingly supported the appeal of the United NationsEmergency Operation as a method of increasing concessional aid to the countriesinvolved, these initially being in the main restricted to countries with under$200 p.c. income. United Kingdom contributions totalled $84m. ( 36m.);some were channelled directly to MSA countries and some through multi-lateral organisations such as the World Food Programme, the UNEO SpecialAccount itself, and the joint response of the e.c.. Major beneficiaries wereIndia and Bangladesh, but other countries to which commitments were madeincluded Kenya, Tanzania and Sri Lanka, as well as countries of the Sahel.
98. With the passage of time, however, excessive concentration on shortterm balance of payments prospect carries with it the danger of failing to distinguish between the need for temporary balance of payments support andthe need for long term concessional aid. Increasingly, therefore, attention mustreturn to basic considerations of poverty in distributing aid funds. This is being done, for example, for the proposed Special Trust Fund, intended to provideimmediate balance of payments support to under $200 p.c. countries, andalso for the proposed subsidy of the interest chargeable to poorer countries ondrawings under the IMF Oil Facility. The proposed IBRD &quot;Third Window&quot;of lending on intermediate terms would also aim to provide additional resources for the poorest countries. The United Kingdom supports these three proposals and is willing to contribute concessional funds for the facilities if substantialsupport is given by other donor countries.99. More directly to emphasise the required direction for aid distribution,however, the United Kingdom feels the time has come for the adoption of aninternational target on aid distribution to parallel the existing targets for thevolume and terms of oda. It has therefore proposed for discussion that eachdonor should aim to give a share of its bilateral oda to the poorest developing countries as a group which is not less than the share of those countries inthe total population of all developing countries, that is, that they shouldreceive not less than the average amount of bilateral oda per head. If the poorest countries are taken to be those with incomes under $200 p.c. thiswould imply a target of about 60 per cent for the share of bilateral oda to thesecountries. The general acceptance of such a target would serve to increase the share of bilateral aid going to these countries from such lower levels as nowpersist.100. Finally, in addition to the emphasis which the United Kingdom believesshould be given to the needs of the poorer countries, it is also desired thatprogrammes should be orientated, as far as possible towards benefiting the poorest within these countries. This will lead to emphasis on rural areas because in many of these countries the majority of the poorest live on the land. rural development is therefore a priority area for United Kingdom aid (see Section III).Sahel101. United Kingdom involvement in the Sahel has in the past been minimal,but the seriousness of the drought situation and the need for an internationalrelief programme has led to the provision of a considerable volume of UnitedKingdom emergency assistance. In view of limited knowledge of the zone itwas decided that it would be best to operate mainly through the FAO who are co-ordinating the flow of relief aid to the Sahel. Immediately the seriousness of the situation became apparent in 1973 a contribution of $0-70m. ( 300,000)was made to the Sahel Trust Fund which had been set up by the FAO. In 1974a further $1-17m. ( 500,000) was provided to the Fund. The e.c. also played a major part in providing emergency food and non-food aid to the Sahel in1974 and the United Kingdom share of the cost of this initiative was over$8- 19m. ( 3-5m.). Under bilateral arrangements 10,000 tons of grain were provided to Mali in 1974 and 2,000 tons to The Gambia. Difficulty in getting the food aid to the areas of greatest need within the Sahel were considerable;to help overcome this problem ten lorries were airfreighted to Chad and another
ten lorries to Niger. In addition a ferry was provided to take lorries carryingfood aid across the Senegal River into Mauritania.III. PROMOTION OF FOOD PRODUCTION AND rural development POLICY CONCERNING INTEGRATED RURALDEVELOPMENT102. It is a central objective of United Kingdom aid policy to give a greater emphasis to rural development. Many developing countries have alreadydevoted significant resources to development in the rural sector, and for manyyears donors, including the United Kingdom, have supported rural develop-ment projects. But the United Kingdom along with many other donors and international agencies, recognises that a greater and more sustained emphasis on stimulating rural development is now required if there is to be much improve-ment of the living standards and conditions of large rural populations in the developing world who exist at subsistence level and whose marginal situationis more starkly revealed at times of natural disaster. The United Kingdom&apos;spurpose is to promote the development of the rural areas, where the majorityof the poor of the Third World live, as a principal basis for effective economic growth, as the most effective means of ending starvation and malnutrition, andas a necessary means of increasing world food production.103. The United Kingdom understands rural development to be the improve-ment of living conditions in rural areas through the increased productivity ofagricultural and related enterprises and, if it is to benefit lower income groups,the equitable and fair distribution of the wealth so created as between individualconsumption, investment, and communal social services.104. The United Kingdom believes that at the centre of successful rural development is increased agricultural production. The creation of wealth froma wide range of rural activities is needed not only to give the rural populationa surplus, but to provide the basis for sustained development by enablingfarmers to continue to afford the inputs of new technology (for example,seeds, fertilisers, pesticides) and by supporting the social and other services which are an essential part of the full development of rural areas. Thus, inmost environments first consideration will be given to annual crops, dairyprojects and animal husbandry, or fisheries, which will go largely to feed the rural populations themselves. But assistance to marketing of food surplusesand to industrial and export crops must be associated with such food cropproduction and, under suitable conditions, can on its own be the basis for a rural development project.105. The achievement of rural development requires a combination ofinfrastructure, inputs, institutions, and social services. These elements arearticulated by each country according to its own social, economic, and politicalpreferences, and it is recognised that each country, and often each region or district, will have its own particular needs for the facilities, services and inputswhich can promote rural change. The United Kingdom takes integrated rural
development to refer to a balanced and co-ordinated approach which seeks to take into account the varied needs and circumstances of a particular regionor district.106. However, rural development is not a self-contained process, and thereare numerous vital links between the development of each nation&apos;s overalleconomy and that of the rural economy and population. Many activitiessignificant for rural development are not physically located in the rural areas.In aiding the building of a fertiliser plant or financing improvements in thetransport system, for example, the external donor is also clearly contributing to rural development.107. In any given situation only some of the components of rural develop-ment will be suitable for external provision or support, and these can onlybe identified in consultation with the authorities responsible for directing an enterprise,   i j108. United Kingdom assistance to rural development can take differingforms and be directed to a variety of purposes. There can be a need for financialassistance or for technical assistance, or for a combination of both. The UnitedKingdom can become involved in a fully integrated area development, orsimply in one particular element of a project, the rest of which might be withinthe capacity of the local government concerned, either with or without assist-ance by other aid agencies, with whom the United Kingdom is ready to collaborate.109. The forms which United Kingdom assistance can take are illustrated by current projects:(i) Regional resource studies in the Oriente region of Ecuador $1 -078m.( 461,000), and the Yemen Arab Republic estimated cost over $2m.( 855,000). The latter study is being carried out in co-operation withthe recipient Government by scientific units and associated bodies ofODM, with the help of outside consultants in specialist fields. Bothstudies will pay particular attention to social aspects.(ii) Integrated rural development projects in South Darfur, Sudan $l-963m. ( 839,000)-and Tigre, Ethiopia $l-682m. ( 719,000).(iii) Dryland farming projects in Botswana, and Indore, India. The purposeof the; latter, undertaken in co-operation with the Government ofIndia, the State Government of Madhya Pradesh, Indore university and the United Kingdom Freedom From Hunger Campaign is toprovide a package of agricultural techniques for the many small farmers in rain-fed areas who have not so far shared in the &quot;GreenRevolution&quot;.(iv) Under parallel financing arrangements with IBRD/IDA, a livestockdevelopment project in Kenya (United Kingdom contribution of$3- 159m. ( 1 -4m.), and the Ashuganj Fertiliser Project in Bangladesh(United Kingdom contribution of $18-714m. ( 8m.)).110. The United Kingdom believes that special attention should be paid tothe distributional aspects of rural development projects. Where possible, it will seek particularly to assist projects designed to benefit the poorer rural popula-
tion (small farmers, sub-marginal farmers and landless labourers), and safe-guard and strengthen the role of women in rural development. Projects and programmes which aim to increase agricultural production will be designed inways which minimise the displacement of labour and, where possible, createadditional opportunities for productive employment.111. The United Kingdom considers that whether it is helping to developjust one of the components of rural development, or by contrast is the mainexternal contributor to an area scheme covering many different components,it will have increasingly to take into account the interrelationships existing between different aspects of development. It is clear, for example, that rural development plans must take account of their potential impact on populationstructure change, and conversely population and family planning programmesmust be related to other programmes of rural development. Improved rural development will undoubtedly require more intensive and more protractedresearch, planning, and evaluation. The United Kingdom expects to make more use of preliminary studies or pilot programmes as a prelude to any moreextended schemes, and is devoting attention to evolving a better appreciation of social factors at work in development in the rural situation.112. The United Kingdom also considers that adequate local participation in rural projects from an early stage is a prerequisite of self-sustaining develop-ment. It considers that projects should include as many qualified local personnelas possible and that, where the use of expatriate staff is unavoidable, steps should be taken from the beginning to ensure that local personnel are trainedto take over. In order to secure adequate co-operation between indigenousdeveloping country staff and external personnel there may be a requirement for new forms of technical assistance designed especially to meet the require-ment of continuity.113. A number of factors will influence the scope and speed with which theUnited Kingdom can reorient the emphasis of its aid programme. The processof identifying, formulating and initiating new rural development projects islikely to take longer than most other forms of assistance, for a variety of reasons: the intrinsic complexity of rural situations, the desire to make more carefully planned and relevant contributions, and manpower constraints bothin the United Kingdom and in recipient countries. In addition, the UnitedKingdom recognises that other bilateral donors and international aid agenciesare simultaneously placing greater emphasis on the rural sector. In order notto slow down disbursements from the aid programme as a result of intro-ducing a new emphasis on rural development, the implementation of the latter will have to be realistically related to achievable rates of expenditure.114. As an external donor, the United Kingdom cannot, and does not,desire to impose its rural development policies on recipient countries in the developing world. However, in order to increase the emphasis on rural develop-ment projects in its aid effort, the United Kingdom is taking a more activerole by making clear its desire and willingness to strengthen its contributionto rural development, and by seeking out new opportunities for projects bothbilaterally and in co-operation with multilateral agencies. A growing consensuson priorities, such as Commonwealth Heads of Government considered was evident at the Commonwealth Ministerial Meeting on Food Production and rural Development, is expected to assist with this process of reorientation.
115. The United Kingdom considers that the Commonwealth ministerial meeting on Food Production and Rural Development provided a valuableopportunity for Commonwealth Ministers to consider ways in which impetuscould be given in a Commonwealth context to World Food ConferenceResolutions for raising the level of food production and promoting rural development in developing countries. Ministers attending the Meeting took the view that problems of rural development and food production should be attacked in an integral manner and should be given the highest priority in allinternational and national efforts in future, and should be treated as an issueof vital concern in the allocation of resources, both financial and human, inthe building up and strengthening of institutions, in the formulation of programmes and policies and in the flow of intra-Commonwealth aid. TheUnited Kingdom considers that the consensus reached on the high priority to be given to rural development by individual governments and agencies wasthe most important and worthwhile outcome of the Meeting. The UnitedKingdom joined other Commonwealth countries in endorsing this view at the subsequent Heads of Government Meeting in Kingston, Jamaica.116. A number of steps have already been taken to implement the newemphasis on rural development in the United Kingdom aid effort. The classifi-cation by economic sector of United Kingdom commitments and disbursementsof bilateral financial aid and technical assistance, as presented in &quot;British AidStatistics&quot;, while useful in many respects, does not give an accurate picture of assistance to rural development. For example, road projects are naturallyclassified as &quot;transport and communications&quot; though many of them are anessential ingredient of rural development. The same applies to some health and education projects. In the hope of providing a more comprehensive index of assistance to the rural areas, new classifications of expenditure are being developed based on identifying individual projects separately by both locationand purpose. In spite of the considerable technical and conceptual problemsof devising a reporting system which will facilitate the consistent collection ofinformation over the whole programme, it is intended to introduce the newclassification into the next issue of &quot;British Aid Statistics&quot;.117. Within ODM, a Rural Development Department has been set up toco-operate with Geographical Departments, professional advisers and associatedspecialist units, to achieve a more positive promotion of rural development and to implement the new policy emphasis. The Department will also have aspecial concern with integrated development schemes. An interdisciplinarySteering Group on Rural Development, which brings together in a single forumthe many sources of specialist advice and the operational geographicaladministrators, has been established:(i) to consider and advise on functional guidelines and other policydirectives on aid for rural development;(ii) to stimulate and monitor progress towards greater involvement in rural development projects.118. Country Policy Papers (which analyse all the factors which need to betaken into account to reach decisions on the composition of the United Kingdomaid programme to individual countries) are being reviewed to examine how
far future aid programmes to each individual country can reflect the emphasis on rural development.119. Guidance on the identification of additional opportunities for rural development assistance has been prepared for Diplomatic Missions andDevelopment Divisions overseas, all of which have an important part to play in implementing this policy.120. The United Kingdom has also been discussing with international agencies, including the IBRD/IDA, possible opportunities for increasedcollaboration in rural development projects. At the same time it has made clearthat it is ready to support and play its part in other international initiativeswhich seem likely to serve a useful purpose in providing additional funds forrural development, in co-ordinating activities of various donors in this field and in ensuring a more effective use of available resources.Policy regarding Aid to Agriculture121. In general, the aim of the United Kingdom&apos;s aid in the agriculturalsector, including fisheries and forestry, is to assist developing countries toimprove the quantity and quality of production of both food and cash earningcommodities. The United Kingdom recognises that the food problem in developing countries is one for grave concern, and that the improvement ofthe situation depends mainly on increased production in those countries. Theneed for more assistance is certainly acknowledged but it is essential that this be accompanied by a real commitment by the governments of developing countries to a programme of increased food production through agricultural development. Food aid is not a desirable alternative to this, nor to betterprotection against crop losses in the field and in store, production planning andmore equitable systems of food distribution. It would also greatly enhanceworld food security if stockholding to cushion harvest fluctuations were more widely dispersed, and the developing countries themselves were encouragedand assisted to produce in good years in excess of their current national con-sumption, and to conserve and hold at least modest stocks against emergencies.122. The United Kingdom&apos;s policies and programmes for developing countries, with particular emphasis on the least developed, are increasinglytending to concentrate on the problem of bringing small farmers into thesystem of development. Incentives must be provided to the farmer to surpassthe target of feeding himself and his family, and so make a contribution tothe food needs of others and perhaps to the agricultural export earnings ofhis nation. Furthermore action for small farmers requires a specially adaptedsystem of organisation and an institutional pattern which involves a wide range of essential activities such as modification of land tenure practices, provisionof credit under systems suitable for small farmers, extension systems devisedexpressly for small farmers, marketing organisations specifically designed; andan end to share cropping systems where there are no fair returns to the farmerson what they put into the land. Every country has its own unique balance of physical, economic, social and political factors. Hence it is unwise to generaliseabout solutions.Agriculture123. The United Kingdom has long paid special attention to agricultural development and has encouraged developing countries to give adequate
emphasis in their development programme to the agricultural sector. For thispurpose the ODM has well qualified professional staff both in Britain and overseas. Attempts are now being made to intensify the United Kingdom&apos;sbilateral concentration on development aid for food and agriculture. Supportis given for similar movements in multilateral aid.124. In the end successful development in the agricultural field depends verymuch on the formulation of firm and realistic policies by the developing countries and the level of aid must to a large extent be determined by these policies and by the requests received from those countries.Agricultural Research125. Bilateral assistance for agricultural research is concentrated on specificproblem-solving projects which cover most of the scientific disciplines. Thoseprojects (about 60) whose results can be applied regionally or even globallyare funded from one Research and Development Subhead, while those (about 50)which are aimed at a narrower national problem are supported from &quot;country&quot;programmes. More than half of this aid is concerned with food productionand the remainder goes to export crops to improve foreign exchange earnings of the ldc&apos;s. The main food crops studied are staple diet foods, such as sorghum,millet, maize, potato, cassava, pigeon pea, cowpea, etc; various problemsassociated with grasslands and animal production are also examined. such work is widely scattered overseas and covers projects in Southern, East and west Africa, Caribbean, Pacific, Asia and Latin America. Results from thisresearch are disseminated in several ways: special reports are produced forrecipient governments to aid planners and administrators, close liaison is setup with local extension and advisory services and, if required, the scientificresults are translated into extension literature. Every research project usuallyhas at least one paper published in a scientific journal and full use is made ofthe Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux publication service. The ODM fromother funds may support developmental projects which apply the results of itsresearch work. Support by the United Kingdom for International Centres underthe aegis of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research is described at paragraph 58 above.,:&apos;v  .  -       &apos;Vif j..(!Agricultural InputsVolume of United Kingdom Assistance126. United Kingdom bilateral assistance to agricultural development in1974 amounted to $18-4m. ( 7-9m.) or 2 per cent of the gross official aid.Assistance to &quot;agriculture and livestock&quot; amounted to $13-8m. ( 5 -9m.);to forestry $433,000 ( 185,000); to fishing $383,000 ( 164,000) and to &quot;otheragriculture&quot; S3 - 8m. ( 1-6m.).Fertilisers127. The present world shortage of fertilisers is a serious constraint to agricultural development, and in the short term there is no simple solution to this shortfall in world production.
128. The basic problem, shortage of supply, applies as much to the UnitedKingdom as to the developing countries. The United Kingdom is a net importerof fertilisers, and the British industry could have difficulty in meeting domesticdemands over the next year or two. The United Kingdom is not therefore well placed to help developing countries by the provision of fertilisers through the aid programme. Nevertheless the United Kingdom has provided 25,000 tonsof fertiliser compound through the new FAO/International Fertiliser SupplyScheme and is considering what more can be done. Recently an additional10,000 tons were made available to Bangladesh under bilateral aid, and india has bought over 146,000 tons with British aid at a cost of over $37m. ( 16m.).The United Kingdom will continue to make every effort both to utilise itsfertiliser capacity to the full and to assist the developing countries, and parti-cularly those most seriously affected by rising prices, to meet their needs.129. Where possible the United Kingdom thinks it better policy to respond to requests for technical assistance to help in the medium term to increase the utilisation of existing plants in the least developed countries as well as torequests for provision of capital aid for the establishment of additional fertiliserproduction capacity. Since 1971 the United Kingdom has committed 858m.( 25m.) to help build three fertiliser plants in India, one of which is in produc-tion and the other two should be coming on stream this year. $16m. ( 6-7m.)have been committed for a similar project in Turkey, $19m. ( 8m.) for one in Bangladesh and a further project for India will be considered shortly. TheUnited Kingdom is also able to provide technical assistance in the geologicalfield to locate indigenous deposits of raw materials (this is being done in pakistan) and to assist with investigations into low energy inputs into farmingsystems.Pesticides130. Pesticide production has also been affected by a tight world supply situation for raw materials. As an importer of these raw materials the UnitedKingdom is affected. No pesticide aid is provided at present but any such aidwould in any event have to be in place of, and not additional to, other aid.The United Kingdom, however, exports a substantial amount of its total outputof pesticides and has a good record in research, extension and training on national and overseas protection measures in the aid field through the centre for Overseas Pest Research.Crop Protection131. In many countries the overall food losses from pests now amounts tosome 30 per cent and immediate savings of up to 10 per cent can be expected from simple schemes for pesticide application, suitable for the small farmer.The United Kingdom is well qualified to provide the necessary training andtechnical assistance through its Centre for Overseas Pest Research and itsTropical Products Institute.Seeds and Root Crops132. The United Kingdom is assisting in the promotion of the seed industryin developing countries by the training of technical personnel in the technology
of seed production and is also assisting in the improvement of root and othervegetatively propagated crops under its technical assistance programme.Other133. The United Kingdom also assists in many other areas including disease and weed control, mechanisation, soil water conservation reclamation andthe livestock industry.Ministry of Overseas Development,London, SWIE SDHI IPrinted in England for Her Majcsty&apos;s Stationery Office by Harrison &amp; Sons (Hayes) Ltd.15669  Dd 124694  K18  9/75
