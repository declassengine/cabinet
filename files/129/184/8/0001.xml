THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 8322 July 1975ECONOMIC STRATEGYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Energy1. We have based our economic strategy on the assumption that three factors - North Sea oil, a recovery in world trade, and the cheapness of our exports - will soon work in our favour and themselves halt the recession.But in reality:a. Only the net gains from North Sea oil can be counted upon andthey only by 1978-79.b. The recession in world trade is still deepening and mostforecasters do not now expect much recovery until the latter part of1976 and 1977.c. It will at best take several years to regain our relative position as a manufacturing exporter because industry must firstinvest in product development, marketing and expansion of productive capacity before it can make major gains in the world market.It is therefore clear that no external factors are going to rescue us withinthe lifetime of this Government and that while output, employment and investment are falling, we are now accepting policies which will make itimpossible for us to escape the post-war vicious circle of low investment,low productivity and pressure on the balance of payments.2. Our discussion of public expenditure should take realistic account ofthe severe and prolonged recession now facing Britain and should be basedon a new set of priorities for national spending, applied both to the public sector and to the private sector, which are agreed in broad terms with theTrades Union Congress and which will secure the consent of working people.Nor should it be forgotten that the welfare state frustrates savings throughunemployment since benefits rise automatically.COPY NO g 2CABINET1
3. I suggest that the priorities for national spending through the recession should include:a. Raising investment in key sectors.b. Maintaining employment.c. Protecting low income groups.Such priorities would mean economies in other areas of investment and cutsin living standards of higher income groups,4. For the public sector these priorities would mean:a. Selective expanding, rather than cutting back, investment by those nationalised industries which can contribute to the future requirements of the economy so that the next world expansion shouldnot be frustrated by lack of productive capacity.    The activity of theNational Enterprise Board should be concentrated on these industries.b0 Maintaining employment in public services.c. Ensuring that spending cuts do not mean higher charges (6uchas rents and fares) for low-income groups,,d. Concentrating cuts where foreign exchange can be saved orresources released for industrial investment.e. Imposing spending cuts and/or tax increases which bear onwealthier private organisations and individuals.5. Spending priorities should equally be observed in the private sector.This requires an urgent start with Planning Agreements.    The Bank ofEngland!s powers of credit control and exchange control to limit private investment abroad (over  1 billion in the six months October 1974 to March1975) must be decisively reinforced and their effective use secured.Selective direct controls are needed to prevent a resurgence of propertyinvestment and speculation abroad.6. We must seek agreement on these new priorities for public and private spending.    But it will not be sufficient simply to secure an agreedreallocation of a declining total.    We must also make sure that the totalitself rises to reduce unemployment, and make more use of resources whichare available.    This can only be done if we adopt a comprehensiveprogramme of protection and foreign exchange saving, and if we implementfully Labour&apos;s industrial policy.A W BDepartment of Energy21 July 19752
