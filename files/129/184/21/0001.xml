DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NO      Q 1CABINETMEASURES TO ALLEVIATE UNEMPLOYMENT: II ilMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. The Secretary of State for Employment has proposed that, in thelight of the September unemployment figures, we should announce that the manpower Services Commission (MSG) are being authorised to introduce awork creation scheme.    He has also proposed that we should advance thedate of the recruitment subsidy for school leavers, which the ministerial committee on Industrial Development (IDV) has approved for introduction on1 November.    I agree that we need to take a fresh look at these proposals in view of the trend in unemployment.    But I felt that we should at the sametime consider the case for announcing other possible measures of the kind which we have already introduced in order to act on the unemployment problem and safeguard our industrial capacity,    I now attach a paper by officials which discusses possible measures,2,        In brief, the main possibilities of this kind are -i. Recruitment subsidy for school leavers.     5 per head perweek is to be paid for 26 weeks to employers taking on school leaverswho have not previously obtained a job.    Gross cost  5 million;maximum gross employment effect 35, 000-40, 000,&quot; ilii. Work creation.    The MSG scheme is designed to employ15, 000 people, mainly the young, on non-essential amenity and welfare projects.    These projects would be administered by localauthorities, voluntary bodies and private firms but would be financed by grants from the MSC,    This scheme was earlier considered byIDV, but not endorsed by them.    Gross cost  30 million; maximumemployment effect 15, 000.    The MSC has pressed for an early announcement of the scheme, if it is agreed, on the grounds that itis unlikely to have much impact on unemployment before the New Yearunless practical planning can start in the next few weeks.iii. Training.    Proposals for relatively limited further expansionof this programme may be presented soon, but meanwhile the onlyfirm proposal received involves increasing somewhat the adult training allowances.    Gross cost  5 million a year,1C(75) 9618 September 1975
iVa Advance factory programme.  20 million of further work could be undertaken on the building and modernisation of factorieson Government and industrial estates,v. Industrial investment schemes.    A further  50 million couldbe allocated under Section 8 of the Industry Act, to supplement the 100 million announced in the Budget, for acceleration of capital projects by individual firms and for further industry schemes.3. The total gross cost of proposals i. -iii, which are aimed more directly at unemployment in the short term, is about  40 million incurredover the next 18 months.    There would, however, be some offset in theform of unemployment benefit saved.    This might reduce the cost by abouta quarter to a third.    It is very difficult to calculate the employment effect,which depends on such factors as the take-up of the schemes, the degree towhich recruitment of one worker displaces another and the extent to whichpeople made redundant actually register as unemployed.    Very broadly,however, the maximum effect on employment might be about 50, 000 byearly 1976, though this does not allow for any displacement.    This wouldbe additional to the effect of the Temporary Employment Subsidy.4. The  20 million on advance factories would be spent in about thesame time, but the further  50 million for industrial investment would bespread over five to six years.    These measures are relevant to thedevelopment of our longer term industrial strategy, which we shall shortly be discussing in the National Economic Development Council, but theydo also have some limited impact on employment in the short term, apartfrom their psychological effect, and I think that they could perfectly wellbe presented in a single package with the other measures, if that is thepreferred course.    The total gross cost of the whole package is put ataround  110 million in Great Britain, and perhaps a further  5 million for northern Ireland.5. We need to take into account on the one hand the mounting andunderstandable pressure, especially from our supporters, to take actionso as at least to take the edge off the unemployment problem, and on theother hand the imperative need to contain the borrowing requirement in the short run and public expenditure in the medium term.    I should see extreme difficulty in the way of any proposal which might jeopardise this latterobjective, and from this point of view it is the work creation scheme whichcould present the most problems.    At the same time it is the onlymeasure in the package which could be expected to create additional jobs in the short term.    I myself believe that, especially if it were directedso far as possible towards the problem of the young, it need not prevent us from holding the line, as we must do, against increases in local authority expenditure programmes.    On this basis, I should be prepared to acceptthe proposals from the Secretary of State for Employment, in conjunctionwith the other measures listed.    In that event, I should see advantage inan early announcement of the whole set of measures.2
conclusions. On balance I myself see advantage in this particular set of measures, which could strengthen rather than weaken our position incontaining expenditure programmes generally.    The presentation of themeasures will clearly require careful handling, and the question of timingis clearly a matter of political judgment but, if my colleagues share my view on this, I would prefer to arrange an early statement of the set of measures, in collaboration with the Secretary of State for employment and the Secretary of State for Industry.//D W treasury Chambers18 September 1975II3
MEASURES TO ALLEVIATE UNEIIPLOirlENT AND INCREASEINDUSTRIAL EFFICIENCY1   1     1  1   1 1 11Note by OfficialsIntroduction1.     Over the past year the economy has had to face the problemof.world recession and growing unemployment in the UK.     But the severe constraints imposed by our very large balance of paymentsdeficit, our excessive rate of inflation, and the large public sector borrowing requirement have inhibited the Government fromresponding to the situation by general reflation of home demand.However, a number of measures have been introduced which, whilefalling short of general reflation, have been designed -(a) to ensure so far as possible that our industrial capacity is not impaired by the recession and that our ability to compete in the next upturn is not weakened and(b) to act on the unemployment problem&quot; selectiyely-   rather. than through raising the level of demand in the economy generally.2.     These measures have included -(a) the  100 million package announced in the Budget to accelerate major investment projects and to assist selectedindustries to modernise and rationalize $(b) an additional  50 million to the Manpower Services Commission(MSC) for the expansion of training facilities, alsoannounced in the Budget, and the further  10 million fortraining measures announced in July;(c) the introduction on 18 August of the Temporary EmploymentSubsidy as an incentive to companies to suspend plannedredundancies.1
3.     We have been asked, to consider what further measures of thiskind, again falling short of general reflation, could now &quot;beintroduced to meet the aims described in 1(a) and (b) above.     Theproposals which look most promising, and which can best be reconciled with the severe constraint under which we are operating,are discussed below and are listed in the table appended to this paper.Recruitment Subsidy for School Leavers4.     Ministers have already agreed at IDV that a subsidy to employers who take on school-leavers should be introduced, afterconsultation with the TUC and CBI which is taking place.    Thedecision was to be kept confidential until nearer the date of introduction but it has been leaked.     The scheme involves paying 5 per head per week for P6 weeks to employers for any school-leavers who have not previously obtained a job and who are taken on by 31 December, and a similar provision for Christmas school-leavers in Scotland, to operate in March and April.     An amendment to the Employment Protection Bill is to be tabled for committee stage in the Lords on 15 or 16 October, giving broad powers tointroduce this type of scheme.     The existing decision is tointroduce the scheme on 1 November, and on this basis the cost ofthe scheme is estimated at  3.3 million (not counting UnemploymentBenefit etc saved), up to the end of September 1976.     It is nowproposed that the date of implementation should be brought forward by two weeks to 20 October, at an extra cost of about  14- million(1)(gross).     There is an unresolved question whether the subsidy should be paid to local authority and other public sector employers.Arguments against this are that two thirds of local authority wagecosts are already met by Central Government by rate support grant,and it would be difficult to reconcile this further specific subsidywith the stern injunctions from the Government to local authoritiesto restrict their manpower;,and that it should be possible to urgepublic sector employers to give preference where possible toschool-leavers without recourse to a cash incentive.(1) .    2If the subsidy were announced at once, rather than when the amend-ment to the Employment Protection Bill is tabled, payments under thescheme, once introduced, might be made with retrospective effect asfrom the date of the announcement.SECRET
Work Creation5.     The Manpower Services Commission have prepared a plan underwhich local authorities, nationalised industries, voluntary bodies and private firms would provide about 600 non-essential amenityand welfare projects giving employment to about 15*000 people in atwelve month period.     Examples are supervision of play groups,road safety instruction in schools, driving disabled people,meals on wheels, painting old people&apos;s dwellings, amenity grasscutting, clearing footpaths, litter clearance, restitution ofvillage ponds, excavation of archaeological sites.     The cost isestimated to be about  30 million per annum (not allowing forunemployment benefit saved).     The scheme could be introducedunder existing legislation within about a month of a decision,and be financed by an increase in the grant-in-aid to the MSC.The main point in favour of such a scheme is that it wouldgenuinely create jobs in the near future, and that it is the onlycandidate for inclusion in the proposed package which could beexpected to have any significant effect of this kind.     Thesubsidy for school-leavers, for instance, is more likely either to affect the timing of recruitment or to switch employment toschool-leavers from older people.6.     Against this, the scheme might come in for criticism on thegrounds that it was only tinkering with the problem, whileindustrial workers may object that the money should be devoted topreserving employment in industry rather than allocated totrivial-sounding jobs of the kind involved in this scheme.     It isalso a serious drawback to the proposal that it would involveurging local authorities, who would be the main providers of the projects concerned, to take on temporary staff in the immediatefuture, while at the same time seeking to impose severe constraintson their regular manpower programmes from next year on.     The factthat the money would be channelled through the MSC should help to identify the scheme as special and temporary, and it would further3SECEET
help to meet the objections just mentioned if it could beorientated towards younger people to a greater extent than hasfeatured in the MSC1s original proposals.Training7.     As noted above, there has already been a major expansionof the training programmes in the public and private sectors.The Training Services Agency have been asked to consider what morecan be done but they will not be able to report back with firm proposals for some weeks.     In any case the amount of expenditure,and the scope for increase, is not likely to be significant.Meanwhile the only firm proposal is for the uprating of trainingallowances.8.     The allowances paid to trainees in the main courses sponsored by the MSCs Training Services Agency were increased substantially in the summer as part of the measures announced in the Budget.The differential by which the allowances exceed unemploymentbenefit is intended as an incentive to potential trainees bothunemployed and in employment.     Unemployment benefit is to beuprated in November and a further simultaneous increase in the allowances could be justified, in the light of the high level ofunemployment, in order to maintain the existing target for thenumber of trainees.     Maintaining the percentage differentialwould cost about  5 million a year.Advance Factory programme .     An extra  20 million of building and modernising factorieson Government industrial estates could be done in the period up to april 1977.     This would provide up to 1,000 genuine extra jobs in the construction industry in the Assisted Areas over thatperiod.     The new factories should be ready for occupation in timefor the upswing and thus have some long term structural benefit4SECRET
to the economy.     The split between England, Wales and Scotlandremains to be settled:    the provision for England could include some of the work recommended by the Steel Closure Task Force forHartlepool and some &quot;industrial rehousing&quot;.     Some of this work could qualify for assistance from the e.c. Regional development fund.Industrial Investment Schemes10.     It is proposed to allocate a further  50 million underSection 8 of the Industry Act in order to carry further theindustrial measures announced in the Budget for sustaining our industrial capacity in the recession and improving our industrialperformance in the medium term.      25 million of this would bemade available for accelerated capital projects by individual firms,to be achieved by loosening somewhat the terms on which assistance is available.     It would remain the objective that new private sector investment should be generated in a ratio of 5 or 6 : 1to the Government money provided.11.    The balance of  25 million would be made available for a new industry scheme.     The Department of Industry have a number of proposals under consideration, for example schemes:(a) to increase the use of waste paper by the UK paper industry;(b) for the textile machinery industry;(c) for the printing machinery industry;(d) for an expansion of the existing ferrous foundry plan.Provision of  25 million would be sufficient to finance the waste paper scheme which, in reducing import penetration of a keymaterial, serves a priority objective of our industrialstrategy; and this is the Department of Industry&apos;s prioritycandidate.5SECRET
12.   The effects of this expenditure by way of generatingemployment in the short term are incidental to the longer termindustrial objectives.     Nevertheless they should have a smallbeneficial effect on employment over the next eighteen months.Cost15.    The gross expenditure involved in this package of measures(1)is provisionally estimated at around  110 million.     leaving aside Section 8 assistance to industry, about  20 million would be spent in 1975-76 and  40 million in 1976-77.     The remaining 50 million of Section 8 assistance would be spread over five to six years, with significant expenditure starting in 1976-77.Only the advance factory programme is specifically confined tothe assisted areas; in this case the division between Vales,Scotland and the English regions would have to be settledinterdepartmentally, taking local employment needs into account.14.   There would be a greater or lesser degree of offset to the gross cost to the extent that the measures reduce   the numbers ofunemployed who would otherwise be drawing benefit.     The appendix to this paper lists against each item the notional employmenteffect, ie the number of people involved on the assumption of maximum take-up of the scheme.     But the size of the expenditureoffset would depend in part on the extent to which there was acorresponding net employment effect (in fact the reduction in thenumber of unemployed would be considerably less than thesenotional maximum figures) and in part on the average amount ofbenefit per week.     Allowing   for these factors an estimate hasbeen made that the offset to the gross cost of the packagediscussed above would be in the range  13-18 million in a year.Temporary Employment Subsidy15.   The temporary employment subsidy is of interest from two points of view - the extent to which the Government could claimcredit for the existing scheme, and the case for extending thescheme, either by widening the eligible areas or increasing therate of subsidy, or by easing the conditions for eligibility.:dThese figures do not take account of the consequential package of measures which would be expected for Northern Ireland, involvingup to a further  5 million.SECRET
16.   When the existing scheme was drawn up, an estimate was made that the employment effect in a full year might be as high as30,000 to 40,000 at a gross expenditure cost of  8 million.Taking account of the variables mentioned above, we have assumed that the savings in benefit would broadly offset the gross cost.However, there is still only limited experience to help in estimating what the eventual take-up of the scheme will be, andtherefore what amounts will be involved.     Up to 12 September thenumber in respect of whom applications for subsidy had been madewas 2,600, and the number accepted for subsidy was 625.     It isproposed to review the scheme as soon as there is adequateexperience of its operation, but meanwhile there is obviousdifficulty over either reaching conclusions on its extention ormaking firm claims as to its employment effects.Other Measures17.   With the exception of work creation schemes administered bylocal authorities under the aegis of the MSC, we have not considered countercyclical public expenditure schemes of the kindattempted in 1971-72 when local authorities were asked to accelerate spending on infrastructure.     There are two principalobjections to this approach.     First, experience indicates that itis difficult to mount such exercises so as to achieve the desiredeffect in the timescale required and to close them down when anupturn in the economy occurs.      (The problem is aggravated by thefact that additional capital works subsequently generate additionalcurrent expenditure.)     The contracyclical increases in housingimprovement grants, which were hoped to be quick acting, in factcontributed to excess pressure on the building industry at alater stage.     Secondly, it would be impossible to reconcilerequests to local authorities to increase their own expenditurethis year and next on particular programmes or projects with the strong injunction   to cut their spending and reduce theirmanpower demands to a minimum which Ministers are making throughthe Consultative Council. secret
18.    It has been suggested that a special increase in maintenance expenditure on local authority housing could be introduced whichcould operate quickly, and which would be more useful than muchof the work that would be carried out under the job creationscheme.     Others have expressed doubt whether it is possible tosingle out any particular local authority expenditure programme for a special increase without incurring the kind of difficultyreferred to above.19&apos;. It has also been suggested that it would be appropriate to urge young people to take the fullest possible advantage of thescope for them to stay on at school if they do not already have this in mind. This in itself would not necessarily entail any additional public expenditure allocation. But doubt has been expressed about the likely effectiveness of exhortation in thismatter.General20.   A number of Departments have expressed doubts or reservations about the case for the proposed package at this juncture, either on grounds of timing, or with regard to its composition and balance, or on account of the difficulty of reconciling this expenditure, and particularly that part of it affecting localauthorities, with the policy of restraining public expenditure programmes generally.      It is a matter for political judgmentwhether the proposed limited expenditure at this stage would help to stave off pressure for reflationary expenditure on a larger scale.21.   These doubts relate particularly to the proposal for a workcreation scheme.     If this does go ahead, the general view isthat it will require specially careful presentation to try to mitigate the difficulties and expected criticisms, and that itwould help if prominence could be given to relatively moreuseful projects which might be financed under the scheme (forinstance, it has been suggested that maintenance projects in
