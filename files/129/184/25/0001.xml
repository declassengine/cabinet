UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &quot;S government(75) 100 COPY NO22 September 1975CABINETQ national HEALTH SERVICE DENTAL AND OPTICALCHARGES TO PATIENTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services. Following the Cabinet decision of 12 September 1974 not to increasedental charges when the dentists fees were increased last year, dental andoptical charges have remained frozen but public expenditure provision hasbeen based on the assumption that the yield of charges would produce thesame proportion of total costs of the services concerned.    I warned mycolleagues when the health service allocation of public expenditure for1976-77 was cut by  62j million in the Chancellor&apos;s last Budget that it wouldbe impossible to accommodate the consequent shortfall in revenue if chargesremained frozen.    For Great Britain this shortfall would be about 14 million in 1976-77 for increases already made or about to be made in remuneration of dentists and opticians and a further sum of about  4-1 million for the order of increases likely in 1976.    So despite the Party!s long-standingobjection to such charges and our desire to abolish them I have no alternative but to propose to increase patients&apos; charges to meet the  14 million and tomake a contribution towards those further increases in the cost of supplyingglasses which may be expected within the next six months.INCREASED COSTS2. Dentists normally have a new scale of fees from 1 October each yearreflecting the recommendation on net remuneration by the Doctors and dentists Review Body and the calculation of expenses for the year by the dental Rates Study Group.    The increases we are about to implementthrough the scale of fees are about 24 per cent towards which payments onaccount have been made covering the period from 1 April,    Since charges were frozen last year, the payments to opticians for dispensing glasses(cost of lenses and frames plus dispensing fee) have increased on averageby about the same percentage and further substantial increases are expectedwithin the next six months.1
GENERAL PROPOSALS3. In these circumstances where we shall be obliged to increaserevenue from charges, I have had to look not only for the fairest and leastpainful way of doing so but also for one which least offends against theprinciples for which we stand.    Until 1971 a system of flat-rate chargeshad operated.    In 1971 the Conservative Government introduced a cost-related system under which the patient paid 50 per cent of the fee paid todentists, subject to an overall maximum of  10, and approximately100 per cent of the cost of supplying lenses subject to a maximum of 3.50 per lens.    Strong and particular objection was made by the Partyto this system, and I therefore propose to revert broadly to the kind offiat-rate system which we operated during the 1964-70 Administration;although at an increased level of charges in most cases,DENTAL CHARGES4. Under the system now proposed, patients will pay  3. 50 for acourse of treatment (or the actual cost if less), except where denturesare provided when the charge would vary up to a maximum of  12,    Whilstpatients who need extensive treatment will pay less, most, including thosewho attend regularly and require modest amounts of treatment, will be faced with significantly higher charges within the maximum of  3. 50.    Thefirst example in Annex A shows that the cost of a relatively simple courseof treatment will rise from a &quot;frozen&quot;  1.24 to the maximum of  3.50; byany standards a very substantial increase.    At the other extreme thoserequiring the most expensive treatment will pay  6.50 less than at present or under a cost-related system which had a maximum of  10.    Those atpresent supplied with full dentures for  10 will pay  12.    The categories of patients already exempt from charges will of course continue but, as inparagraph 10 I propose a more generous &quot;tolerance&quot; level.OPTICAL CHARGES5. The present charges for National Health Service (NHS) spectacleframes, as inherited from the previous Government, range from  0. 82to  1.93 according to type.    I propose to increase the charges for framesso that they will again - as under previous Labour Governments -correspond with their cost as reimbursed to opticians:  at prices operativefrom 1 October the charges would become  1. 08 rising to  2. 58 and wouldbe adjusted automatically with subsequent increases in the reimbursementprices of frames as agreed by my Department.    The increase in charge for the most popular NHS frame - which is also the cheapest - would be 26por 32 per cent.    For those patients who require half-eye glasses andprefer a &quot;gold-filled&quot; frame, the increase would be as much as  1.12,i.e. from  1.46 to  2.58.2
6. For NHS spectacle lenses, the present charges range from  1,20to  3.50 per lens, according to type (single vision or bifocal) and power -thus bearing most heavily on those who need glases most.    We opposedthis method in 1971 and have done so ever since.    To maintain this kind of system and raise the revenue required would involve very heavy charges for those who needed the strongest or most complex corrections.    I have concluded that it would be fairer to have flat-rate charges for each maintype of lens, without regard to power, as under previous LabourGovernments.    The necessary revenue could be raised by charges of 2.25 per single-vision lens and  4.25 or  5*00 per bifocal lens, thehigher charge applying to &quot;solid&quot; glass or plastic bifocals, which are more expensive to make.    With charges on this basis a small proportion ofspectacle wearers will have less to pay for their lenses them at present, but most of those who wear single-vision lenses will have to pay about  2 a pairextra, and most bifocal wearers will have to pay  3 to  4 a pair extra.Examples of the increases are given in Annex B.7.        Asa further means of helping those who have particularly bad sight -and as a step in the direction of the eventual removal of charges to whichwe are committed - I would propose to abolish charges for glasses for the registered blind and the registered partially sighted.    I estimate that thiswould cost roughly  250, 000 per annum.8. We should like to announce that we are opening negotiations with theoptical trade and profession to try to provide more attractive frames for adults under NHS arrangements.    At present many people, even the poorest, prefer to buy expensive private frames with their NHS lenses.Negotiations would take time and, if successful, the charge for the newNHS frames would cover the full cost.    There will be some additional cost -unquantifiable at this stage and not taken into account in the assessment ofthe net saving - when persons who are exempt from the payment of chargeschoose the more attractive NHS frames unless the charge to others is fixed at a higher level to cover this.9. We also propose to help the children, by providing the much lighterplastic lenses as an alternative to glass for those whose sight needs a powerful correction, and by providing without charge contact lenses for those few who have a clinical need for them, and the all-plastics frame(as an alternative to the one with nickel curl sides) for those who prefer it.There has been strong pressure for this last-mentioned improvement, onaesthetic and psychological grounds.    We propose to pay for these improvements by disallowing the supply of NHS spectacle cases with newprivate frames and by requiring the patient to pay any extra cost of lenseswhich is required in order to enable them to fit such frames.3

EXEMPTION FROM CHARGES10.        Many patients, eg. those on a low income, children and young people are exempt from charges.    I propose to raise the &quot;tolerance&quot; (the marginabove the supplementary benefit level taken into account in assessingincome for exemption purposes) from  1. 50 to  2.50 a week.    This, taken together with the forthcoming general improvements in supplementary benefits, will provide relief for more patients.REVIEW OF CHARGES11.        It will be necessary to review charges each year in order tomaintain their yield at the proportion borne to the total cost of the service at the time the charges were froaen in October 1974.    These proportionsare 18 per cent for dental charges and 54 per cent for optical (omittingfrom the cost the payment for sight tests which are free of cost to the patient).    Amending regulations will be required for each annual change.TIMING12.        I propose to lay the necessary Regulations (which are subject tonegative resolution) in week beginning 6 October so that they are beforeParliament when it resumes on 13 October:  and to bring them into operation on 1 November.FINANCIAL AND STAFFING EFFECTS13.        The proposals are estimated to increase NHS revenue by 16 million net (Great Britain) in a full year.    There are only minorstaffing implications.SUMMARY14. I seek agreement to increase patients1 dental and optical charges(as in paragraphs 4 to 12) from 1 November, My colleagues in Scotlandand Wales agree with these proposals.B A department of Health and Social Security22 September 19754
