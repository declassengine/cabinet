P DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 94 COPY NO      8118 September 1975CABINETMEASURES TO ALLEVIATE UNEMPLOYMENTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment.       I would normally be inclined to look with favour on any suggestion for putting more resources into minor projects to improve the localenvironment.    I am acutely conscious of the extent to which our generaleconomy moves are making it difficult to maintain any momentum for localenvironmental improvement, for which I have the main policy responsibility.But I do not think we can successfully urge local authorities to participate in the planning and execution of this work, as they would have to doenthusiastically if any jobs are to be created quickly, while we are at thesame time strongly urging them to cut back on their current expenditure andtheir manpower.    Many of the schemes suggested will be attacked as of low priority, compared to those that are having to be cut back.    more serious still, they will be strongly resented by the authorities, their direct labour employees, and their unions, who will represent them as givingtheir jobs to others less we 11-qualified to do them.2. Unemployment in construction in June 1975 was running at 12 per centas against 3j per cent in manufacturing..  It will almost certainly get worsestill over the next year.    Even though such figures include some who were only fleetingly construction workers, the real difference is neverthelessimmense.    Against these figures can we defend action to mitigateunemployment that does not give some priority to construction?3. Since we can afford so little to mitigate rising unemployment, what we can afford should be spent in ways that will have maximum politicalimpact in retaining support for voluntary incomes policy.    It must be concentrated on very limited fields, lest it be dismissed as a trivial tokenof conscience money, and those fields must be ones of priority to the unions and the Party.4.        Against this background, I would suggest that we would be betterdevoting some of the limited money available in 1975-76 and 1976-77 to housing improvements.    The cuts have been sources of violent feeling bothin the Party and the unions, and extra sums allocated now could prevent
some substantial redundancies in direct labour departments,     2.5 millionextra for 1975-76 which could possibly be spent by Liverpool, Birmingham,Manchester, Swansea, Rhondda, Newport and certain Inner London boroughs would help to prevent a 1, 000 redundancies this winter. 30 million more in 1976-77 would save 6, 000 jobs.    We can ensure thatthe money is really spent in these years - and not, as with manyprogrammes, allowed to spill over into later years.A department of the Environment18 September 19752In.
