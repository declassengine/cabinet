DEVELOPMENT LAND TAXINTRODUCTION1. The White Paper &apos;Land&apos; (Cmnd 5730, published on 12 September 1974,HMSO, price 18p) outlined the Governments proposals for a new tax on development value realised from land (including buildings) to be known asdevelopment land tax. This new tax will play an essential part in the move towards the achievement of the objects of the Governments comprehensivepolicy on development land. The legislation to implement other aspects of theirpolicy is contained in the Community Land Bill now before Parliament.2. The Inland Revenue issued a Press Statement on 4 February 1975(copies of which can be obtained from the Public Enquiry Room, InlandRevenue, 8 New Wing, Somerset House, London WC2R 1LB) describing the tax proposals in rather more detail. This has given those affected an opportunityto make their point of view known.3. The Government has decided that it would be helpful to all concernedif a draft of important parts of the proposed legislation were made availablefor comment and discussion before the Bill introducing development land taxis submitted to Parliament. Draft clauses and schedules are therefore set out inAppendix A to this White Paper. They are followed in Appendix B by explanatory-explanatory notes.4. The draft clauses and schedules in Appendix A are not necessarily intheir final form and do not cover every aspect of development land tax. Themain topics not dealt with are listed in the following paragraph. Where para-graph references are given after any of those topics, they are references to the paragraphs in the Inland Revenue Statement and for convenience those para-graphs are reproduced in Appendix C. (The explanatory notes indicate other areas in which the draft legislation will, or may, need to be amplified.)5. The topics not dealt with in the draft clauses and schedules are asfollows:a. Administrative machinery, including arrangements for the assessmentand collection of development land tax and deferment in appropriate cases (paragraph 13).b. Arrangements to enable local authorities to acquire land net of thedevelopment land tax payable by the vendor (see Appendix C).c. The application of the new tax to charities. It was announced on 15July (Hansard, 15 July, Cols 403-404, Written Answers) that the Govern-ment will propose that development value realised by charities from landheld on 12 September 1974 should be exempt from development land tax.The intended effect of the proposed legislation is described in Appendix C.d. Rules to deal with certain special cases or circumstances. These includegroups of companies (Paragraph 26), trusts (Paragraphs 28-29), housing
associations and the Housing Corporation (Paragraphs 38-40), statutory undertakers (Paragraph 45), industry (Paragraphs 46-48), minerals (Para-graphs 50-51), and provisions to counter avoidance (Paragraph 57).e. Transitional arrangements (Paragraphs 4, 5 and 10).6. The White Paper &apos;Land&apos; stated that no development land tax would be payable where development value is realised by a residential owner-occupier onthe sale or development of his sole or main residence or of land up to one-tenth of a hectare (approximately i acre) occupied with his house as its garden orgrounds. After further consideration, the Government have decided that theexempted area should be increased from one-tenth of a hectare to 1 acre(approximately 0.4 of a hectare). Clause 12 in Appendix A incorporates the newlimit.7. It is the Governments hope that full advantage will be taken of this further opportunity to offer constructive comments, in particular on technicalaspects, while the legislation is still in a formative stage. Comments should beaddressed to the Board of Inland Revenue, Somerset House, Strand, LondonWC2R1LB.

(1) Subject to the following provisions of this section, thevalue&apos; relevant base value of an interest in land which is disposed of is thatone of the following which gives the highest figure, namely, (a) the aggregate of  25(i) the cost of the chargeable person&apos;s acquisition ofthe interest,(ii) any expenditure on relevant improvements,(iii) the amount by which the current use value of theinterest at the date of the disposal exceeds the current 30use value of the interest at the date of its acquisitionor on 6th April 1965, which ever is the later, and(iv) where section 6 below applies, the special additionprovided for by subsection (2) of that section;(b) the aggregate of 110 per cent, of the current use value of 35the interest at the date of the disposal and of any expen-diture on relevant improvements;(c) 110 per cent, of the aggregate of the cost of the chargeableperson&apos;s acquisition of the interest and of any expenditureon improvements; 40and in this Act the three bases specified in paragraphs (a) to (c)above are referred to as &quot; base A &quot;, &quot; base B &quot; and &quot; base C &quot;respectively.
(2) In any case where the date of a person&apos;s acquisition of an interest in land falls before 1st July 1948, the relevant base valueof that interest on a disposal of it by him shall be base B.(3) For the purposes of this Act, the cost of a person&apos;s acquisition5 of an interest in land means, subject to subsection (5) below, theamount or value of the consideration in money or money&apos;s worthgiven by him or on his behalf wholly and exclusively for the acqui-sition of the interest, together with the incidental costs to him of theacquisition.10    (4) Schedule 3 to this Act shall have effect (a) for determining, in relation to a disposal by any person ofan interest in land, the amount of any expenditure onimprovements and of any expenditure on relevant improve-ments; and15 (b) with respect to matters consequential upon that deter-mination.(5) For the purposes of this section there shall be deducted fromthe amount which on the disposal of an interest in land would, apartfrom this subsection, be the amount of any consideration falling20 within subsection (3) above or of any expenditure on improvementsor relevant improvements, so much of that consideration or expendi-ture as has been or is to be provided or met, directly or indirectly,by the Crown or a government or public or local authority, whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere.25    6-(1) Subject to subsection (4) below, the provisions of this Specialsection apply for the purpose of determining base A on the disposal baseA&quot;of an interest in land (in this section referred to as &quot; the relevantinterest&quot;) where the chargeable person acquired that interest before 1st May 1977.30 (2) Subject to subsection (5) below, where this section applies,there shall be included in the calculation of the base value of the relevant interest a special addition of an amount equal to D x E percent, of the cost of the chargeable person&apos;s acquisition of the relevant interest, where 35 D is the number of years, subject to a maximum of four, in theperiod beginning on the date of the chargeable person&apos;sacquisition of the relevant interest and ending on the dateof the disposal; andE is 15, if the chargeable person acquired the relevant interest40 before 13th September 1974, and 10 in any other case.(3) For the purposes of subsection (2) above a year is a periodof twelve months beginning on, or on ah anniversary of, the date
of acquisition of the relevant interest by the chargeable person and if,apart from this subsection, D referred to in subsection (2) above would consist of either a part of a year or one or more whole yearsand a part of a year, that part shall be treated for the purposes ofthis section as a whole year. 5(4) Subject to subsection (5) below, if there is a deemed disposalof the relevant interest, this section shall not have effect on anydisposal (including a deemed disposal) of that interest which occursafter the deemed reacquisition which immediately follows the deemeddisposal. *0(5) Subject to, subsection (6) below, if there is a deemed disposalof the relevant interest and on that disposal (in this subsection and subsection (6) below referred to as &quot; the previous disposal&quot;) the relevant base value of that interest exceeded the net proceeds of thatdisposal (in subsection (6) below referred to as &quot; MV &quot;), then, in the 15application of this section on the occasion of a disposal subsequent to the previous disposal, (a) references to the date on which the chargeable personacquired the relevant interest shall be construed as refer-ences to the date (prior to the previous disposal) on which 20he acquired that interest, otherwise than on the occasion of a deemed disposal and reacquisition;(b) references to the cost of the chargeable person&apos;s acquisitionof the relevant interest shall be construed as references to the relevant fraction of the amount which would have been that 25cost on a notional disposal by him of the relevant interestoccurring immediately after the date on which he acquiredthat interest as mentioned in paragraph (a) above; and(c) D referred to in subsection (2) above shall be treated asreduced by the number of years (ascertained in accordance 30with subsection (3) above) in the period beginning on thedate on which the chargeable person acquired the interest at mentioned in paragraph (a) above and ending on thedate of the previous disposal. n(6) The relevant fraction referred to in subsection (5)(b) above is  35BV - MVBVwhere BV is the relevant base value of the relevant interest on theprevious disposal, but in a case where paragraph 9 of Schedule 1 40to this Act applies in determining the market value of the relevantinterest for the purpose of the previous disposal, references in sub-section (5) above and this subsection to the relevant base value ofthat interest on the previous disposal shall nevertheless be treated as
references to what would be that relevant base value if paragraph17(1) of Schedule 2 to this Act did not apply.7. (1) For the purposes of this Act, the market value at any time Market value,of an interest in land is the consideration that might reasonably be VahjenandSe5 obtained on a sale of that interest at that time in the open market,  material development.(2) For the purposes of this Act, the current use value of an interest in land at any time is the market value of that interest at thattime calculated on the assumption that it was at that time, andwould continue to be, unlawful to carry out any material development10 of the land other than any material development thereof which, beingauthorised by planning permission in force at that time, was begunbefore that time.(3) In determining for the purposes of subsection (2) above whatmaterial development of any land was authorised by planning15 permission at a time when there was in force in respect of the landonly outline planning permission, only such development of the landas at that time (a) was authorised by that permission without any requirementas to subsequent approval, or20      (b) was not so authorised but had been approved in the mannerapplicable to that planning permission,shall for those purposes be taken to have been authorised by thatpermission at that time.(4) In determining the realised development value accruing to the25 chargeable person on the disposal of an interest in land which is apart disposal resulting from the receipt of any such sum as is referredto in subsection (2) of section 3 above, the current use value of that interest at the date of that disposal shall be taken to be what it wouldhave been at that date if the circumstances which caused the sum30 to be received had not arisen.(5) In determining the market value or current use value of an interest in land at any time, the interest shall be treated as being sold free from any interest or right which exists by way of security in or over the land concerned.35   (6) For the purposes of this Act &quot; material development&quot; meansany development other than (a) development for which planning permission is granted by ageneral development order for the time being in force andwhich is carried out so as to comply with any condition40 or limitation subject to which planning permission is sogranted; and(b) development which is excluded from being material development by Schedule 4 to this Act;D
Devolutionon death.Interests inland acquired by gift or, incertain cases,at an undervalue.and in paragraph (a) above &quot; general development order&quot; means a development order made as a general order applicable (subject tosuch exceptions as may be specified therein) to all land in Englandand Wales, to all land in Scotland or to all land in Northern Ireland,as the case may be. 58. (1) For the purposes of this Act, the devolution of an interestin land on the personal representatives of the person by whom itwas held immediately before his death shall be treated neither as adisposal by the deceased nor as an acquisition by the personal repre-sentatives but, for the purpose of determining the relevant base value 10of that interest on a disposal of it by the personal representatives,anything done by the deceased shall be treated as having been done(at the time it was in fact done) by the personal representatives and, accordingly, (a) the acquisition by the deceased shall be treated as if it had 15been the acquisition by the personal representatives; and(b) any exenditure incurred by the deceased shall be treated as having been incurred by the personal representatives.(2) In any case where, on the death of any person, an interest inland held by him devolves, otherwise than by virtue of any beneficial 20entitlement thereto, on a person other than his personal representa-tives, subsection (1) above shall have effect in relation to that interestwith the substitution of a reference to that person for any referenceto the personal representatives.Interests inland acquired by gift or, incertain cases,at an undervalue.9. (1) Subsection (2) below shall apply in determining the realised 25development value accruing to the chargeable person on the disposalof an interest in land (in this section referred to as &quot; the relevantinterest&quot;) where the chargeable person acquired that interest other-wise than for value; and in the following provisions of this section (a) &quot; the material disposal&quot; means the disposal of the rele- 30vant interest referred to above;(b) &quot; the previous disposal&quot; means the disposal as a result ofwhich the chargeable person acquired the relevant interest;and(c) &quot; the donor&apos;s interest&quot; means the interest disposed of by 35the previous disposal (that is to say, except where thatdisposal was a part disposal, the relevant interest).(2) For the purpose of determining the relevant base value of the relevant interest on the material disposal (a) the chargeable person&apos;s cost of acquisition of the relevant 40interest shall be taken to be an amount equal to that whichwas taken as the cost of acquisition of the donor&apos;s interestin determining the relevant base value of that interest onthe previous disposal;
(b) to the amount which, apart from this section, would be theamount of expenditure on improvements or on relevantimprovements there shall be added an amount equal tothat which was taken as the amount of expenditure on improvements or, as the case may be, on relevant improve-ments for the purpose of determining the relevant basevalue of the donor&apos;s interest on the previous disposal;(c) the current use value of the relevant interest at the date ofits acquisition or on 6th April 1965 shall be taken to be10 equal to the value which, for the purpose of determining the relevant base value of the donor&apos;s interest on the pre-vious disposal, was taken as the current use value of that interest at the date of its acquisition or on 6th April 1965,whichever was the later; and15 (d) section 6 above shall not apply but, if that section applied for the purpose of determining base A of the donor&apos;interest on the previous disposal, sub-paragraph (iv) ofparagraph (a) of section 5(1) above shall have effect inrelation to the material disposal as if it referred to the20 amount of the special addition provided for in relation tothe previous disposal;and if the previous disposal occurred before the appointed day itshall be assumed for the purposes of this subsection that that dayfell (and this Act was in force) before the previous disposal occurred.25 (3) Without prejudice to subsection (2) above, in any case wherethe chargeable person acquired the relevant interest on or after 1stJuly 1948, he shall be treated, for the purposes of section 5(2) of and paragraph 5 of Schedule 2 to this Act, as having acquired the rele-vant interest on the date which was the date of acquisition of the30 donor&apos;s interest for the purposes of the previous disposal.(4) For the purpose of determining the realised development valueaccruing to the chargeable person on the disposal of an interest inland where (a) the chargeable person is either a charity or a body specified35 in paragraph 12 of Schedule 6 to the Finance Act 1975 (for 1975 c.7.purposes of capital transfer tax, transfers of value to certainbodies to be exempt transfers), and(b) the chargeable person did not acquire that interest other-wise than for value, but acquired it for a consideration less40 than that which might reasonably have been obtained inthe open market, and(c) the application of subsections (2) and (3) above would givea higher base value for the interest disposed of than wouldbe available if those subsections were not applied,45 subsections (1) to (3) above shall apply as if the chargeable person&apos;sacquisition of that interest were otherwise than for value.
(5) In any case where by virtue of any provision of this Act anamount falls to be added to the amount which, apart from that pro-vision, would be the cost of acquisition of an interest in land then,notwithstanding that no consideration is in fact given for that interest, the acquisition of that interest shall not be treated for the 5purposes of this Act as being an acquisition otherwise than for value.ExemptionsBodiesexempt fromdevelopmentland tax.1975 c.1973 c. 65.10.

Section 4. SCHEDULE 2Realised Development Value: Supplementary ProvisionsPart IDisposals Out of Assembled LandDate and cost of acquisition 51. (1) This Part of this Schedule applies in any case where thereis a disposal of an interest in land (in this Part of this Schedulereferred to as &quot; the relevant interest&quot;) and the chargeable persondid not acquire the whole of the rights which make up the relevantinterest in a single transaction but acquired at different times two 10or more different interests (whether those interests were different innature or were in different pieces of land or both) which togethermake up the relevant interest.(2) Any reference in this Part of this Schedule to a part of the relevant interest is a reference to an interest in land which was 15acquired by the chargeable person at a particular time and which,together with one or more other such interests acquired at anothertime or other times, makes up the relevant interest.(3) If, before the disposal of the relevant interest, the chargeableperson acquired a lease which (at the time of its acquisition or other- 20wise) became merged in another part of the relevant interest, the lease shall continue to be regarded for the purposes of this Part ofthis Schedule as a part of the relevant interest until the date onwhich it would have expired if the merger had ont occured.2. (1) For the purposes of this Act, the date of acquisition of the 25relevant interest shall be treated, subject to paragraphs 4 and 5below, as the last date on which the chargeable person acquired apart of the relevant interest and the cost of his acquisition of the relevant interest shall, subject to paragraph 5 below, be the aggre-gate of the costs of his acquisition of the several parts of the relevant 30interest.(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) above shall affect the construc-tion of any references in the following provisions of this Part of this schedule to the date of acquisition of any part of the relevantinterest. 35Expenditure on improvements3. (1) Notwithstanding anything in paragraph 2 above, for thepurposes of determining the relevant base value of the relevantinterest, the expenditure on improvements or, as the case may be,on relevant improvements shall be the aggregate of the amounts 40which, if there were a separate disposal of each part of the relevant
interest, would be the amount of that expenditure in determining Sch. 2the relevant base value of each part.(2) For the purpose of the determination referred to in sub-paragraph (1) above, the separate disposals shall be assumed to take5 place at the same time as the actual disposal of the relevant interest.Determination of base A4. Subject to paragraph 5 below, for the purpose of determiningbase A of the relevant interest, (a) a separate current use value, as at the date of its acquisition10 or on 6th April 1965, whichever is the later, shall beestablished for each part of the relevant interest; and(b) the aggregate of the current use values of the several partsestablished in accordance with sub-paragraph (a) aboveshall be treated as the current use value of the relevant15 interest at the date of its acquisition or on 6th April 1965,whichever is the later; and(c) if the chargeable person acquired any part of the relevantinterest before 1st May 1977, section 6 of this Act shallapply, subject to sub-paragraph (d) below, on the disposal of20 the relevant interest (whether or not the date of acquisitionof that interest, as determined under paragraph 2 above, is.before that date); and(d) where section 6 of this Act applies on the disposal of the relevant interest, it shall be applied separately with respect25 to each part of that interest (taking account of the date of acquisition of each part) and, in determining base A of the relevant interest, the special addition provided for by that section shall be taken to be the aggregate of the specialadditions determined for the several parts of the relevant30 interest in accordance with this sub-paragraph.Land acquired before July 19485. (1) The provisions of this paragraph apply if any part of the relevant interest was acquired by the chargeable person before 1st July1948 but, for the purposes of this Act, the date of acquisition of the35 relevant interest is on or after that date; and in the following provi-sions of this paragraph a part of the relevant interest which was soacquired is referred to as an &quot; original part&quot;.(2) For the purpose of determining base A of the relevant interestin a case where this paragraph applies, 40 (a) the cost of the chargeable person&apos;s acquisition of an originalpart of the relevant interest shall be deemed for the purposesof section 5 of this Act to be an amount equal to the currentuse value of that part on the date of the disposal of the relevant interest; and
for the purposes of paragraph 4 above, the current use valueof an original part of the relevant interest on 6th April 1965shall be deemed to be equal to the current use value of that part on the date of the disposal of the relevant interest; and where section 6 of this Act applies on the disposal of the 5relevant interest, that section shall not be applied withrespect to an original part of that interest and, accordingly,that part shall be left out of account in making the aggre-gation required by paragraph 4(d) above.(3) For the purpose of determining base C of the relevant interest 10in a case where this paragraph applies, (a) paragraph (a) of sub-paragraph (2) above shall apply; and(b) from the amount which, apart from this provision, would bethe amount of the expenditure on improvements there shallbe deducted a sum equal to the amount by which, at the 15date of the disposal of the relevant interest, the current use value of the original part has increased as a result ofexpenditure on improvements.(4) In any case where, for the purposes of sub-paragraph (2) or sub-paragraph (3) above, it is necessary to determine the current use 20value of an original part of the relevant interest at the date of thedisposal of that interest, it shall be assumed for those purposes thatat that date the interests existing in the land in which the relevantinterest subsists are the same as those which existed on 1st July 1948and, where any of those interests were leases, that the length of the 25&apos;term still to run on the date of the disposal of the relevant interest isthe same as it was on 1st July 1948.Partial exemptions from charge6. (1) The provisions of this paragraph apply if the chargeableperson acquired a part of the relevant interest (in this paragraph 30referred to as &quot; the material interest&quot;) in such circumstances that, ifthe. material interest continued to exist as a separate entity, section of this Act would apply in determining the realised development value accruing to the chargeable person on a disposal of it.(2) Where this paragraph applies, it shall be assumed for the 35purposes of sub-paragraph (3) below that (a) the material interest exists as a separate entity; and(b) in place of the disposal of the relevant interest there were adisposal at market value of the material interest; and (&amp;(c) on that disposal the relevant base value of the material 40interest were derived from that one of the three bases speci-fied in section 5(1) of this Act which in fact gives the relevant base value of the relevant interest.SCH. 2: ( )(c)
(3) Making the assumptions specified in sub-paragraph (2) above,there shall be ascertained (a) the realised development value which would accrue to thechargeable person on the disposal referred to in paragraph5 (b) of that sub-paragraph; and(b) the realised development value which would accrue to himon that disposal if section 9 of this Act had not been enacted.(4) The provisions of sub-paragraph (5) or, as the case may be,10 sub-paragraph (6) below shall have effect if the amount of realiseddevelopment value ascertained under paragraph (b) of sub-paragraph(3) above exceeds the amount ascertained under paragraph (c) of thatsub-paragraph.(5) If the disposal of the relevant interest is not a part disposal,15 an amount equal to the excess referred to in sub-paragraph (4) aboveshall be deducted from the amount which, apart from this paragraph,would be the realised development value accruing on the disposalof the relevant interest.(6) If the disposal of the relevant interest is a part disposal, the20 relevant fraction of the excess referred to in sub-paragraph (4) aboveshall be deducted from the amount which, apart from this paragraph,would be the realised development value accruing on the disposalof the relevant interest.(7) The relevant fraction referred to in sub-paragraph (6) above25 is that which, for the purposes of the part disposal, was applied (or would, but for paragraph 11 below, have been applied) to the costof the chargeable person&apos;s acquisition of the relevant interest inaccordance with paragraph 9 below.7. (1) The provisions of this paragraph apply if the chargeable30 person acquired a part of the relevant interest (in this paragraphreferred to as &quot; the stock in trade interest&quot;) and the circumstances are such that, if the stock in trade interest continued to exist as aseparate entity, section 13 of this Act would have effect in relationto a disposal of it.35 (2) Where this paragraph applies, there shall be ascertained theamount which, for the purposes of section 13 of this Act, would bethe realised development value attributable to the authorised develop-ment if (a) the stock in trade interest existed as a separate entity; and40      (b) in place of the disposal of the relevant interest there were adisposal at market value of the stock in trade interest; and(c) on that disposal the relevant base value of the stock in trade interest were derived from that one of the three basesg
Sch. 2 specified in section 5(1) of this Act which in fact gives, the relevant base value of the relevant interest.(3) Subject to sub-paragraph (4) below, on the disposal of the relevant interest the chargeable person shall not be chargeable to development land tax on so much of the realised development value  5which accrues on that, disposal as is equal to the amount ascertainedunder sub-paragraph (2) above.(4) In the application of sub-paragraph (3) above in a case wherethe disposal of the relevant interest is a part disposal, the amountascertained under sub-paragraph (2) above shall be treated as reduced 10by applying to it the fraction which, for the purposes of the partdisposal, was applied (or would, but for paragraph 11 below, havebeen applied) to the cost of the chargeable person&apos;s acquisition ofthe relevant interest in accordance with paragraph 9 below.Part II 15Part Disposals8. The provisions of this Part of this Schedule shall have effectwhere there is a part disposal of an interest in land (in this Partof this Schedule referred to as &quot; the relevant interest&quot;); and in thefollowing provisions of this Part of this Schedule  20(a) any reference to the disposal is a reference to the partdisposal of the relevant interest; and(b) any reference to relevant base value is a reference to thatvalue of the relevant interest for the purposes of the disposal.9.-(1) Subject to paragraph 11 below, for the purpose of deter- 25mining the relevant base value (including, in a case where section of this Act applies, the calculation of the amount of the specialaddition provided for by subsection (2) of that section), the amounts which, apart from this sub-paragraph, would be-(a) the cost of the chargeable person&apos;s acquisition of the relevant 30interest, and(b) the expenditure on relevant improvements or, in relation to base C, on improvements,shall each be reduced by applying to them the fraction PD 35PD -f MR,where PD is, subject to sub-paragraph (3) below, the net proceeds ofthe disposal; and 40MR is the market value of the retained interest immediately &apos;.yafter the disposal.
(2) Where sub-paragraph (1) above applies on the disposal, then,in relation to any subsequent disposal of the retained interest, fromthe amounts which, apart from this sub-paragraph, would be (a) the cost of the chargeable person&apos;s acquisition of the retained5 interest, and(b) the expenditure on relevant improvements or, in relation to base C, on improvements,there shall be deducted respectively the amounts which, by virtueof sub-paragraph (1) above were taken, for the purpose specified in10 that sub-paragraph, to be the cost of the chargeable person&apos;s acquisi-tion of the relevant interest and the expenditure on relevant improve-ments or, in relation to base C, on improvements.(3) Where the disposal is a disposal (a) otherwise than for value, or15      (b) for a consideration less than that which might reasonably have been obtained in the open market,the net proceeds of the disposal shall be determined for the purposesof sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) above as if the consideration for thedisposal were the consideration that might reasonably have been20 obtained in the open market.10. (1) Subject to paragraph 11 below, for the purpose of deter-mining the relevant base value, the amount (hereinafter referred to as&quot; CW &quot;) which, apart from this paragraph, would be the current use value of the relevant interest at the date of the disposal shall be25 reduced by deducting therefrom an amount (hereinafter referred toas &quot; CR &quot;) equal to the current use value immediately after that dateof the retained interest.(2) Subject to paragraph 11 below, for the purpose of determiningbase A of the relevant interest the amount which, apart from this30 paragraph, would be the current use value of the relevant interest atthe date of its acquisition by the chargeable person or on 6th April1965, whichever is the later, shall be reduced by applying to it thefraction CW-CRCW.35 (3) Where sub-paragraph (2) above applies on the disposal, then,in relation to any subsequent disposal of the retained interest, somuch of the amount referred to in that sub-paragraph as remainsafter deducting from it the fraction thereof referred to in that sub-paragraph shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to be the40 current use value of the retained interest at the date of its acquisition by the chargeable person or on 6th April 1965, whichever is the later.
Sch. 2 11. (1) If, in a case where the disposal falls within paragraph (b)of. subsection (1) of section 3 of this Act, any cost or expenditure which, apart from this paragraph, would fall to be dealt with under thepreceding provisions of this Part of this Schedule is wholly referableto the land in which either the granted interest or the retained interest 5subsists, that cost or expenditure shall be attributed to that interestand shall not be dealt with under paragraph 9 above.(2) If the current use value, as at the date of the disposal, of theinterest disposed of is identifiable without reference to sub-paragraph(1) of paragraph 10 above, that sub-paragraph shall not apply and, 10for the purposes of the disposal, that current use value shall be treatedas the current use value of the relevant interest at that date.(3) If the current use value of the interest disposed of, as at thedate of its acquisition or on 6th April 1965, whichever is the later,is identifiable without reference to sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 10 15above, then, (a) for the purposes of the disposal that current use value shallbe treated as the current use value of the relevant interest atthe date of its acquisition or on 6th April 1965, whichever isthe later; and 20(b) on a subsequent disposal of the retained interest, a separatecurrent use value shall be established for that interest as atthe date of its acquisition or on 6th April 1965, whichever is the later.Part HI 25Additional Provisions Applicable toLeases and Reversions on Leases12. (1) In determining the realised development value accruing to the chargeable person on the part disposal of an interest in land which consists of the grant of a lease out of that interest, from the 30amounts which, apart from this sub-paragraph, would be the market ;value and the current use value of the retained interest there shall be deducted an amount equal to the value immediately after the grant ofthe landlords rights under the lease.(2) Any reference in this Part of this Schedule to the value at any 35time of the landlords rights under a lease is a reference to the valueat that time of the rights of the landlord under the lease, exclusive ofthe right to recover possession at the expiry of the term.13.

ScH.! 2 Rents and other income payments23. For the purposes of this Act, in the case of a dispositionconsisting of the grant of a lease, the consideration for the disposalshall be taken to be the aggregate of the capital values at the date ofthe disposal of- 5(a) the right to receive the rent (if any) which, in accordance.   with the terms of the disposition, is payable in respect of the lease; and(b) any other consideration which in accordance with those terms is given or agreed to be given for the disposition, 10&apos; whether to the grantor or to any other person.24. In calculating for the purposes of this Act the capital value atany date of a right to receive rent payable in respect of a lease, it shallbe assumed that the lessee under the lease will always pay that rentwhen it falls due and will perform his other obligations under the 15lease.25. Without prejudice to paragraphs 23 and 24 above, if the wholeor any part of the consideration for the disposal of an interest in landconsists of a rent charge or any other series of payments in the natureof income, then, for the purposes of this Act, that consideration or 20part thereof shall be taken to be the market value at the date of thedisposal of the right to receive that rent charge or other series ofpayments.Options26.-(1) References in this paragraph to an option are references 25to such an option as is referred to in section 3(4) of this Act and, inrelation.to an option, references to the grantor are references to theperson by whom the option was granted or the person, who is for thetime being obliged to give effect to the option if it is exercised.(2) If an option is exercised, the grant of the option and the trans- 30action entered into by the grantor in fulfilment of his obligations under the option shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as asingle transaction and accordingly (a) if the option binds the grantor to dispose of an interest inland, the consideration for the option is part of the con- 35sideration for the disposal; and(b) if the option binds the grantor to acquire an interest in land,the consideration for the option shall be deducted from the. amount which, apart from this paragraph, would be the costof his acquisition of that interest in pursuance of his obliga- 40tions under the option.
(3) For the purposes of this Act, the exercise or abandonment of Sch. 2.an option by the person for the time being entitled to exercise it shallnot constitute the disposal of an interest in land by that person but,if an option is exercised, then the acquisition of the option (whether5 directly from the grantor or not) and the transaction entered into bythe person exercising the option in exercise of his rights under the option shall be treated as a single transaction and accordingly-(a) if the option binds the grantor to dispose of an interest inland the cost of acquiring the option shall be part of the cost10 of acquiring that interest; and(b) if the option binds the grantor to acquire an interest in land,the cost of the option shall be treated as a cost incidental tothe disposal of the interest which is acquired by the grantorof the option.15 Part VIIncidental Costs27. (1) For the purposes of this Act, the incidental costs to achargeable person of the acquisition of an interest in land or of its disposal shall consist of expenditure falling within sub-paragraph (2)20 below and wholly and exclusively incurred by him for the purposesof the acquisition or, as the case may be, the disposal.(2) The expenditure referred to in sub-paragraph (1) above isexpenditure on fees, commission or remuneration paid for the pro-fessional services of any legal adviser, surveyor, valuer, auctioneer,25 accountant or agent, and any other costs of conveyance or transfer(including stamp duty) together (a) in the case of the acquisition of an interest in land, with costs of advertising to find a seller, and(b)&apos; in the case of the disposal of an interest in land, with costs30 of advertising to find a buyer and costs reasonably incurred in making any valuation required for the purposes of deter-mining the realised development value accruing to thechargeable person on the disposal, including&apos;in particular.....    :   expenses reasonably incurred in ascertaining market value35 where required for the purposes of that determination.
Section 5. SCHEDULE 3Expenditure on Improvements1. (1) For the purposes of this Act, in relation to a disposal byany person of an interest in land (in this Schedule referred to as &quot; the relevant interest&quot;), expenditure on improvements means, subject to 5the following provisions of this Schedule, any expenditure wholly andexclusively incurred by that person or on his behalf on or after thedate of acquisition of the relevant interest (a) for the purpose of enhancing the value of that interest, beingexpenditure reflected in the state of the land in which that 10interest subsists or the market value of that interest at thedate of disposal; or(b) in establishing, preserving or defending his title to that interest or his enjoyment of the land by virtue of that interest. 15(2) Notwithstanding anything in sub-paragraph (1) above, expendi-ture incurred in, or in respect of, the carrying out of any work ofmaintenance, repair or decoration or any similar work of a recurrentnature is not expenditure on improvements.(3) Where any expenditure incurred as mentioned in sub- 20paragraph (1) above did not relate exclusively to the land in whichthe relevant interest subsists, only that proportion of that expendi-ture which inured for the benefit of that land shall be treated asexpenditure on improvements.2. For the purposes of this Act, in relation to the disposal of 25the relevant interest, expenditure on relevant improvements is that part of the expenditure on improvements which remains after deducting therefrom a sum equal to the amount by which, at thedate of the disposal, the current use value of the relevant interesthas increased as a result of the expenditure on improvements. 303. (1) Subject to paragraph 5 below, this paragraph applieswhere,-(a) on or after the date of acquisition of the relevant interestand before the date of its disposal (in this paragraphreferred to as &quot; the material date &quot;), planning permission 35for the development of the land in which that interest sub-desists has been granted subject to a condition regulating thedevelopment or use of other land in which, at the time ofthe grant, the chargeable person held an interest (in thisparagraph referred to as &quot; the affected interest &quot;), and      40(b) the affected interest has not been disposed of on or beforethe material date and is not disposed of on that date.
(2) Where this paragraph applies- Sch. 3(a) there shall be ascertained the amount that would have beenthe current use value of the affected interest on thematerial date if the condition referred to in sub-paragraph5 (l)(a) above had not been imposed; and(b) the amount (if any) by which the current use value deter-mined under paragraph (a) above exceeds the actualcurrent use value of the affected interest on the materialdate shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as expen-10 diture incurred as mentioned in paragraph 1(1) above.4. Where paragraph 3 above applies on the disposal of the relevantinterest then, subject to paragraph 5 below, on the first disposalthereafter of the interest which was the affected interest for thepurposes of paragraph 3 above, 15 (a) in determining base A of that interest, paragraph (a) ofsection 5(1) of this Act shall have effect as if, from theaggregate of the items specified in that paragraph therewere required to be deducted whichever is the smaller ofthe amount referred to in paragraph 3(2)(6) above and the20 amount (if any) by which the current use value of that interest at the date of its acquisition or on 6th April 1965,whichever is the later, exceeds the current use value ofthat interest at the date of the disposal; and(b) base C shall not be available as the relevant base value of25 that interest.5. (1) If, in a case where paragraph 3 above applied on thedisposal of the relevant interest, the condition referred to in sub-paragraph (l)(a) of that paragraph is varied within the period of six30 years beginning on the date of that disposal, that paragraph shall betaken always to have applied with the condition in the form in whichit is as varied.(2) If, in a case where paragraph 3 above applied on the disposalof the relevant interest, the condition referred to in sub-paragraph35 (l)(a) of that paragraph is removed within the period of six yearsreferred to in sub-paragraph (1) above, paragraph 3 above shall betaken never to have applied in relation to that disposal.(3) All such adjustments with respect to liability to developmentland tax shall be made as may be necessary in consequence of the40 provisions of sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) above.

Section 13.SCHEDULE 5Authorised development . For the purpose of determining what planning permission was inforce on 12th September 1974 with respect to any land, a determina-tion made by the Secretary of State before the date of the relevant 5disposal and after 12th September 1974 on an appeal under theappeals provision against a decision of a planning authority made (or,for the purposes of the appeal, treated as made) before that dateshall be treated for the purpose of the principal secttion as havingbeeen made immediately before that date. 102. Where planning permission in force on 12th September 1974was outline planning permission only, then, for the purposes of theprincipal section, the development of the land concerned which is tobe treated as authorised by that permission is any development which  15(a) on that date was authorised by the permission without any requirement as to subsequent approval, or(b) was not so authorised on that date but was either (i) development for which, on the date of the relevant dis-posal, approval had been granted in the manner applic- 20able to that planning permission, or(ii) development for which, on  12th September 1974,approval might reasonably have been expected to begranted in that manner, not being development forwhich, on the date of disposal, approval had been 25refused in that manner.3. On the disposal of an interest in land for which planning permis-sion granted for a limited period was in force on 12th September1974, that permission shall be treated, for the purposes of the princi-pal section, as having ceased to be in force before that date unless it 30was also in force on the date of disposal.4.

Section 151- SCHEDULE 6Interaction of Development Land Tax With Other TaxesPreliminaryI. In this Schedule &quot; chargeable realised development value&quot; means realised de-  5&quot;&quot;   velopment value on which development land tax is in factchargeable;a &quot; DLT disposal &quot; means a disposal (within the meaning ofthis Act) of an interest in land;a &quot; CGT disposal&quot; means a disposal, for the purposes of tax on 10chargeable gains, of an asset consisting of an interest inland; anda &quot; trading disposal &quot; means a disposal of an interest in landwhere the proceeds of the disposal fall to be included in thecomputation of the profits or gains of a trade or business 15carried on by any person.Reduction of chargeable gain by reference to realised developmentvalue2. (1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, ifchargeable realised development value accrues to any person on a 20DLT disposal and that disposal is also a CGT disposal on whicha chargeable gain accrues (or would but for this Schedule accrue)to any person, then, for the purposes of capital gains tax or, as thecase may require, corporation tax on chargeable gains, a sum equalto the amount of that chargeable realised development value shall be 25deducted from the amount which, apart from this Schedule, would bethe amount of the chargeable gain.(2) If, in a case where sub-paragraph (1) above applies on thedisposal of an interest in land (in this paragraph referred to as &quot; the relevant interest&quot;) the sum which is the consideration for the purposes 30of the DLT disposal (in this paragraph referred to as &quot; CD &quot;) exceeds the sum which is the consideration for the CGT disposal, as deter-mined for the purposes of tax on chargeable gains, for the reference in sub-paragraph (1) above to the amount of the chargeable realiseddevelopment value which accrues on the disposal there shall be 35substituted a reference to the fraction of that realised development value of which the numerator is the consideration for the CGTdisposal, as so determined, and the denominator is CD.(3) Subject to sub-paragraph (5) below (a) where sub-paragraph (2) above has had effect on a disposal 40of the relevant interest (in this paragraph referred to as&quot; the primary disposal &quot;), and
(b) there is a subsequent disposal (in this paragraph referred     .Sch. 6to as &quot;the later disposal&quot;) of the whole or any part ofthe relevant interest which is either a .CGT disposal alone or both a DLT disposal and a CGT disposal,5 then, if the later disposal is not also a DLT disposal it shall be treatedas such for the purposes of this paragraph and (in every case) thereshall be treated, for the purposes of sub-paragraph (1) above, asaccruing on the later disposal, in addition to any chargeable realiseddevelopment value which in fact accrues on that disposal, such10 proportion of the chargeable realised development value whichaccrued on the primary disposal as is represented by the differencebetween the fraction of that value appropriate to the later disposaland the fraction thereof appropriate to the last preceding disposalof the relevant interest (whether that is the primary disposal or a15 subsequent disposal).(4) For the purposes of this paragraph, in relation to the chargeablerealised development value which accrued on the primary disposal,the fraction appropriate to the primary disposal is the fraction deter-mined under sub-paragraph (2) above, and the fraction appropriate20 to any subsequent disposal of the relevant interest is that fraction of which the numerator is CA and the denominator is CD where&quot; CA&quot; is the aggregate of the following, as determined for thepurposes of tax on chargeable gains, namely, (a) the consideration for the primary disposal;25      (b) the consideration for the subsequent disposal; and(c) the consideration for any disposal of the relevant interest which occurred between the primary disposal and the subsequent disposal.(5) On the occasion of the first disposal of the relevant interest30 where the fraction which, in accordance with sub-paragraph (4)above, is appropriate to the disposal is or exceeds unity, (a) sub-paragraph (3) above shall have effect in relation to thedisposal as if for the words &quot; as is represented by thedifference between the fraction of. that value appropriate to35 the later disposal and&quot; there-were substituted the words&quot;as remains after deducting therefrom&quot;; and(b) on any subsequent disposal of the relevant interest no furtherproportion of the chargeable realised development, value which accrued on the primary disposal shall be added in40 accordance with sub-paragraph (3) above.(6) The deduction from the amount of a chargeable gain which isprovided for by sub-paragraph&apos; (1) above shall be applied to theamount of that gain (a) before making any reduction under section 34 of the Finance 1965 c. 25.45 Act 1965 (transfer of business on retirement) or under any
Sch. 6 other enactment providing for relief by reference to theaggregate of a loss and a gain or of two or more gains orlosses, and(b) before making any adjustment under section 38(2) of thatAct (unit trusts: in certain cases only one-tenth of gains 5to be chargeable gains), under the proviso to section 208(2)1970 c. 10. oi tne Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 (partiallyapproved superannuation funds: part of gain not to be1970 c. 24. chargeable gain) or under section 21(7) of the Finance Act1970 (investments held partially for purposes of certain 10retirement benefit schemes: part of gain not to be charge-able gain), and(c) before making any reduction under section 93 of the Finance1972 c. 41. Act 1972 (reduction in amount of chargeable gains to beincluded in company&apos;s total profits), 15but after taking account of any other provision affecting the deter-mination of the amount of any chargeable gain.(7) Subject to paragraph 4 below, in any case where the sumreferred to in sub-paragraph (1) above is greater than the amountfrom which, by virtue of that sub-paragraph, it falls to be deducted, 20it shall be treated for the purposes of this paragraph as equal to that amount.3. (1) If chargeable realised development value accrues to anyperson on a DLT disposal which is a deemed disposal and, accord-ingly, does not constitute a CGT disposal of the interest in question 25and that deemed disposal is followed by a CGT disposal (in thisparagraph referred to as &quot; the subsequent disposal &quot;) of that interest or any part of it, then, (a) if the subsequent disposal is not also a DLT disposal, itshall be treated as such for the purposes of paragraph 2 30above; and(b) whether or not paragraph (a) above applies, the charge-able realised development value which accrued on theearlier DLT disposal shall be treated for the purposes ofparagraph 2 above as accruing on the subsequent DLT 35disposal (in addition to any chargeable realised develop-ment value which in fact accrues or is otherwise treatedas accruing on that disposal); and(c) whether or not paragraph (a) above applies, the considera-tion for the purposes of the subsequent DLT disposal shall 40be treated for the purposes of sub-paragraph (2) of para-graph 2 above as equal to the aggregate of the considera-tion for the earlier DLT disposal and the amount of any. expenditure on improvements.(2) The reference in paragraph (c) of sub-paragraph (1) above to 45the amount of any expenditure on improvements is a reference to
what would be that amount for the purposes of a DLT disposal of     Sch. 6the interest which is the subject matter of the subsequent disposal,being a DLT disposal occurring contemporaneously with the sub-sequent disposal.5   4. (1) If, in a case where paragraph 2(1) above applies on thedisposal of an interest in land, (a) section 33 of the Finance Act 1965 (replacement of busi- 1965 c. 25.ness assets) applies in relation to the CGT disposal in such circumstances that the interest disposed of constitutes or is10 included among the old assets, and(b) the chargeable realised development value referred to inthat paragraph is greater than the chargeable gain, if any,which, apart from this Schedule, would accrue on thedisposal,15 paragraph 2(7) above shall not apply and, subject to sub-paragraph(2) below, the amount by which that chargeable realised develop-ment value exceeds that chargeable gain (in this paragraph referredto as &quot; the unapplied balance of chargeable development value &quot;)shall be carried forward from the disposal and applied in accordance20 with the provisions of this paragraph. ,(2) If, in a case falling within sub-paragraph (1) above, the charge-able realised development value referred to in paragraph 2(1) aboveexceeds what would be the amount of the chargeable gain accruingon the disposal in question if section 33 of the Finance Act 196525 did not apply, the chargeable realised development value shall betreated for the purposes of sub-paragraph (1) above and the follow-ing provisions of this paragraph as equal to that amount.(3) Subject to sub-paragraph (4) below, the unapplied balance ofchargeable development value shall be set off against the amount30 of any chargeable gain which (apart from this paragraph) would accrue on a subsequent CGT disposal of the new assets and, if theunapplied balance is greater than the amount of any such charge-able gain, the remainder shall again be carried forward to set offagainst subsequent chargeable gains accruing on the disposal of35 further replacement assets, and so on until the whole of the balance is exhausted.(4) If, in a case falling within sub-paragraph (1) above, section 33of the Finance Act 1965 has effect subject to the provisions of para-graph 16 of Schedule 19 to the Finance Act 1969 (depreciating assets) 1969 c. 32.40 in such circumstances that the whole or any part of the chargeablegain referred to in sub-paragraph (2) of that paragraph accrues inaccordance with that sub-paragraph, (a) the unapplied balance of chargeable development valueshall be set off against the amount of any chargeable gain45 which accrues as mentioned in that sub-paragraph; and
Sen. 6 (ft) if the unapplied balance is greater than the amount of anysuch chargeable gain and part of the postponed gain is.     Carried forward.to asset No. 3 under sub-paragraph (3) ofthat paragraph, the remainder of the unapplied balanceshall be dealt with under sub-paragraph (3) above. 5(5) In any case where, by virtue of sub-paragraph (3) or sub-- paragraph (4) above, the unapplied balance of chargeable develop-ment value or any part of it falls to be set off against the amount ofa chargeable gain, a sum equal to that unapplied balance or part thereof shall be deducted from the amount which, apart from this 10paragraph, w^uld be the,amount of the chargeable gain and, if theunapplied balance or part thereof exceeds that amount, the charge-able gain shall be extinguished.(6) In this paragraph &quot;the old assets&quot; and &quot; the new assets&quot;1965 c.25. have, the same meaning as in section 33 of the Finance Act 1965 15. and &quot;asset No. 3&quot; has the same meaning as in paragraph 16 of1969 c.32. Schedule 19 to the Finance Act 1969.Reduction of profits or gains by preference to realised development value     . ; -5.-(1) If chargeable realised development value accrues to any 20person on a DLT disposal and that disposal is also a trading disposal,then, in computing the profits or gains of the trade in question forthe&quot; year of assessment or accounting period in which the disposaloccurs, a sum equal to the amount of that chargeable realised&apos;:&apos;:development value shall be allowable as a deduction. 25(2) If, in a case where sub-paragraph (1) above applies on thedisposal of an interest in land (in this paragraph referred to as &quot; the relevant interest&quot;) the sum which is the consideration for the pur-poses of the DLT &apos; disposal (in this paragraph referred to as--&quot;&apos;-&apos;&quot;CD &quot;) exceeds the consideration for the trading disposal (in this 30paragraph referred to as &quot; CT &quot;), as brought into account in com-puting the profits or gains referred to in sub-paragraph (1) above, forthe reference in that sub-paragraph to the amount of the chargeablerealised development value which accrues on the disposal there shall -be substituted a reference to the fraction of that realised develop- 35. ment value of which the numerator is CT and the denominator is(3) Sub-paragraphs (3) to (5) of paragraph 2 above shall have-,effect in relation to sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) above (a) as if any reference therein to sub-paragraph (1) or sub- 40...  :   paragraph (2) of that paragraph were a reference to sub-, paragraph (1) or, as the case may be, sub-paragraph (2) ofthis paragraph; and
(b) as if, in sub-paragraph (4), for the words &quot; as determined for the purposes of tax on chargeable gains&quot; there were substituted the words &quot;as brought into account in comput-ing the profits or gains of the trade in question for the year5 of assessment or accounting period in which each disposaloccurs&quot;.6. (1) If chargeable realised development value accrues to anyperson on a DLT disposal which is a deemed disposal and, accord-ingly, does not constitute a trading disposal of the interest in question10 and that deemed DLT disposal is followed by a trading disposal (inthis paragraph referred to as &quot; the subsequent disposal&quot;) of that interest or any part of it, then, (a) if the subsequent disposal is not also a DLT disposal, itshall be treated as such for the purposes of paragraph 515 above; and(b) whether or not paragraph (a) above applies, the chargeablerealised development value which accrued on the earlierDLT disposal shall be treated for the purposes of paragraph5 above as accruing on the subsequent DLT disposal (in20 addition to any chargeable realised development value whichin fact accrues or is otherwise treated as accruing on thatdisposal); and(c) whether or not paragraph (a) above applies, the consideration for^the purposes of the subsequent DLT disposal shall be25 treated for the purposes of sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph5 above as equal to the aggregate of the consideration forthe earlier DLT disposal and the amount of any expen-diture on improvements.(2) The reference in paragraph (c) of sub-paragraph (1) above to30 the amount of any expenditure on improvements is a reference towhat would be that amount for the purposes of a DLT disposal ofthe interest which is the subject matter of the subsequent disposal,being a DLT disposal occurring contemporaneously with the subsequent disposal.

A person who disposes of an interest in land (includingbuildings) on or after the appointed day will be chargeable to DLT on therealised development value. Although the land must be in the United King-dom, the charge will apply whether or not the person is resident there.Subsection (3) imposes tax at the rate of 80 per cent.Clause 2.  Deemed disposals at start of material developmentThis clause makes the start of a project of material development (seeClause 7(4) and Schedule 4) an occasion for charging DLT.Subsection (1). Immediately before such a project is begun (see para-graph 2, Schedule 1) on any land, every major interest in the land is to betreated as having been disposed of, and then immediately reacquired, at market value.Subsection (2) gives effect to Schedule 1, which defines a project ofmaterial development and contains other supplementary provisions.Subsection (3) defines a major interest in land so as to exclude a free-hold or leasehold reversion which is subject to a long lease (i.e., one with atleast 50 years to run) if the rent or any premium to which the interestholder may be entitled does not, and cannot be made to, reflect the valueof the development. An interest in land which is not that of a freeholderor leaseholder (e.g., the right to a wayleave or the right to enforce a restric-tive covenant) will also be excluded if its market value is less than  5000.Subsection (4) makes adaptations to subsection (3) in its application to scotland.Subsection (5) gives rules for ascertaining, for the purposes of thisclause only, the unexpired term of a lease or agreement for a lease. these rules are based on those contained in Section 84 of the Income and Corpora-tion Taxes Act 1970. The term will normally be the period for which the lease was granted but if, by reference to the facts at the time material
development started, it seems likely that the lease would run for a differentterm, then the lease will be treated as having been granted for that term.Clause 3.  Part disposalsThis clause contains rules about part disposals of interests in land. see also Part II of Schedule 2.Subsection (1). Any reference to a disposal of an interest in land is toinclude a reference to disposal of part of that interest. A part disposal maybe the grant of an inferior interest in the whole or part of the land (e.g.,the grant of a lease out of a freehold interest) (paragraph (a)) or the dis-posal of a part of the land (paragraph (b)).Subsection (2). There is a part disposal of an interest in land whenever the owner of that interest derives any sum (other than sums falling within(1) above) by virtue of his ownership, even though the person making pay-ment to the owner does not himself acquire an interest in the land in ex-change for his payment. Examples of the sums to which this subsectionapplies are:  under paragraph (a), compensation paid for injurious affection of land,for infringement of ancient lights, for damage to the land or for revoca-tion of a planning permission;under paragraph (b), payments received for granting or releasing a restrictivecovenant;under paragraph (c), sums received for the granting of wayleaves, or forthe grant of a licence to take sand or gravel.Subsection (3).  Defines &quot; sum &quot; for the purposes of subsection (2).Subsection (4). The grant of an option does not constitute a partdisposal but rather the creation of a separate interest in land (see alsoSchedule 2, paragraph 26).Subsection (5) defines &quot; retained interest&quot; and &quot; granted interest&quot; inrelation to part disposals. These expressions are important for the purposesof Part II of Schedule 2.Clause 4.  Realised development valueThis clause provides the method of calculating realised development value, on which DLT is chargeable.Subsection (1) defines realised development value as the excess of thenet proceeds of the disposal over the &quot; relevant base value &quot; (see Clause 5).Subsection (2) defines chargeable person.Subsection (3) defines net proceeds of disposal as consideration (Part V,Schedule 2) less incidental costs (Part VI, Schedule 2). In the case of leases and reversions, this figure is subject to adjustment under Part III,Schedule 2.
Subsection (4) gives effect to the supplementary provisions concerningrealised development value which are contained in Schedule 2 and allowsregard to be paid to pre-appointed day events.Subsection (5). Where no specific rules are provided for apportioningconsideration, expenditure or value, this subsection authorises such appor-tionment to be made as is just and reasonable.Subsection (6) guards against double deductions in arriving at theamount of any realised development value.Clause 5.  Relevant base valueThis clause prescribes the base values which may be used in calculatingrealised development values.Subsection (1). In general, the highest of the following three basesvalues is to be used: -Base. A: The aggregate of cost of acquisition of the interest in land, ex-penditure on relevant improvements (see note on subsection (4)below), increase in current use value since date of acquisition(or 6 April 1965, if later) and the special addition where applic-able (see Clause 6).Base B: The aggregate of (i) 100 per cent of current use value and (ii)expenditure on relevant improvements.BaseC: 110 per cent of the aggregate of cost of acquisition and ex-penditure on improvements.Subsection (2). Where the interest in land was acquired before 1 July1948, only base B is available.Subsection (3) defines the cost of acquisition of an interest in land asthe amount or value of the consideration which was given wholly and ex-clusively for that interest, together with the incidental costs of the acquisi-tion. Incidental costs are defined in Schedule 2, paragraph 27.Subsection (4) introduces the rules in Schedule 3 for determining amounts of expenditure on improvements and relevant improvements.Subsection (5). Expenditure which is met directly or indirectly from government or public or local authority funds is not to count as expenditure by the person disposing of the interest.Clause 6.  Special addition to base ASubsections (1) and (2). Where base A is applicable the acquisition costmay be enhanced by a special addition. If the interest in land was held at12 September 1974, the addition is 15 per cent of the acquisition cost foreach year or part of a year of ownership up to the time development value is realised, subject to a maximum of 60 per cent. Where the interest inland is acquired after 12 September 1974 but before 1 May 1977, theaddition is 10 per cent for each year or part of a year, subject to a maximum of 40 per cent.
Subsection (3). The special addition is calculated by reference to theperiod of ownership. Part years are treated as if they were full years.Subsection (4). Where there has been a deemed disposal and reacquisi-tion on the occasion of the commencement of material development, no special addition is given on that deemed reacquisition cost.Subsections (5) and (6). Where on a deemed disposal the relevant basevalue exceeds the net proceeds of disposal (e.g., where the temporary or partial development of an interest in land does not fully realise its inherentdevelopment value) the special addition provided for in the Clause willcontinue to run beyond the date of deemed reacquisition on part of theacquisition cost. This part is found by multiplying the original acquisitioncost by a fraction whose numerator is the &quot; loss &quot; arising on the temporaryor partial development (i.e., the amount by which the relevant base valueexceeds the net proceeds of disposal arising from the project of material development) and whose denominator is the base value. On a subsequentdisposal this part will carry special addition from the date of actualacquisition, reduced by any addition applicable to that part already takeninto account on the occasion of the deemed disposal.Clause 7.  Market value, current use value and material developmentSubsection (1) defines the market value of an interest in land as theconsideration that might reasonably be obtained on its sale in the open market.Subsections (2) and (3). Define &quot; current use value &quot; as the value of theinterest in land in the open market, assuming that it was and would con-tinue to be unlawful to carry out any material development (other than theright to complete any development fully authorised by planning permissionwhich was started before that time).Subsection (4) contains a special rule for arriving at current use valuewhere the receipt of compensation etc. is treated as a part disposal. Thecurrent use value of the interest in respect of which the compensation is paid is to be the value which would have applied if the circumstances caus-ing the compensation to be received had not arisen (i.e., the undamagedcurrent use value).Subsection (5). The market and current use values of an interest in landare to be determined as if the land were free from any security which maybe charged upon it.Subsection (6) defines &quot; material development&quot; as any development which is neither covered by a general development order not excluded from being material development by Schedule 4.Clause 8.   Devolution on DeathDLT is not charged when an interest in land passes on an owner&apos;sdeath,to the personal representatives or any other person not beneficiallyentitled to the interest. On a subsequent disposal of the interest, the personal
representatives etc. will have the base value that would have been availableto the deceased person.Clause 9.  Interests in land acquired by gift or at under-valueSubsection (1) is introductory.Subsection (2). Where a person disposes of an interest in land whichhe has acquired otherwise than for value (i.e., by gift or inheritance), hisacquisition cost is taken to be the acquisition cost of the previous ownerincluding special addition; any expenditure on improvements or relevantimprovements incurred by the donor is also attributed to the present owner.Similarly, the current use value at the previous owner&apos;s date of acquisition(or 6 April 1965, if later) will be available for determining the relevant basevalue of the present owner. Special addition (see Clause 6) will cease to runfollowing a disposal otherwise than for value.Subsection (3). On the disposal of an interest in land acquired otherwise than for value on or after 1 July 1948, the chargeable person is to be treatedas having acquired it on the date of acquisition by the previous owner.Subsection (4). On the disposal of an interest in land at an under-value, the general rule is that the disposers liability and the acquirers basewill follow the facts. But if the new owner is a charity (or one of the bodies listed in paragraph 12, Schedule 6, Finance Act 1975) and on a sub-sequent disposal the application of the rule set out in subsection (2) above would provide a higher base value than would otherwise be the case, thathigher base value may be used (i.e., it may be treated as if it were an out-right gift).Subsection (5) provides that an acquisition of an interest in land is notto be treated as a gift, even if no consideration was given, if for DLT pur-poses an amount has to be added to the cost of acquisition. (See the note on Part III of Schedule 2).Clause 10.  Bodies exempt from DLTThis Clause lists the authorities which are exempt from DLT whenthey realise development value.Clause 11.   Exemption for first  5000 of development valueSubsection (1). An individual or company will not be chargeable toDLT on realised development value which in any financial year (i.e., theyear ending 31 March) does not amount to more than  5000.Subsection (2). If an individual^ or company&apos;s realisations of develop-ment value exceed  5000 in any financial year, the first  5000 &quot; slice &quot; willbe exempt from DLT.Subsection (3). Where there is more than one realisation of develop-ment value, the  5000 &quot; slice &quot; will be allocated primarily to the first realisa-tion in point of time, any balance to the second and so on.
Subsection (4). The Inland Revenue statement of 4 February 1975(see, for example, paragraphs 45 to 48) announced that in certain circum-stances (not yet reflected in the draft clauses) the commencement of a project of material development would not be an occasion of charge, butthat DLT would be chargeable on a subsequent occasion, such as the saleof the property. This subsection specifies that for the purpose of the entitle-ment to the  5000 exemption, the development value realised by carryingout the project is to be treated as having accured at the end of the financialyear in which the project was commenced; any part of his  5000 &quot; slice &quot;still available for that year may therefore be set against that development value.Subsection (5). The trustees of a settlement will be entitled, as a body,to the  5000 exemption, quite separately from the exempt &quot; slices&quot; towhich the individual trustees will be entitled in their private capacities.Subsection (6). For any financial year during the whole of which a married man has his wife living with him, the husband and wife have theexempt slice of  5000 between them. Within that limit any amount of theslice can be allocated to either husband or wife and where each realisesdevelopment value during the year the exempt slice is allocated in order oftime.Subsection (7) provides special rules for partnerships. For DLT apartnership is treated as a single individual with an exemption limit of 5000. For this purpose a change in the membership of the partnership isto be disregarded if an election could be made for the continuation basisof assessment for income tax purposes, whether or not an election is in factmade. (See also Clause 19).Clause 12. Private residencesSubsection (1) sets out the general principle that no DLT is chargeableon the realisation of development value from the disposal of an individual&apos;private residence, or land which forms part of that residence.Subsection (2) defines private residence as the individual^ sole or mainresidence at the date of disposal, together with land which he has for hisown occupation and enjoyment with that residence as its garden or groundsup to an area (inclusive of the site of the house) of one acre. Where thearea of the house and grounds exceeds one acre the exempt part is to bethat which is most suitable for occupation and enjoyment with the house.Subsection (3). An individual will be eligible for the private residenceexemption if at the date of disposal he has owned the house for at least months and has occupied it either for 12 months out of the last 2 years or,if he has owned it for less than 2 years, for at least half the period of ownership subject to a minimum period of at least 6 months. (Subsections(7) and (8) deal with cases where the owner has died.)Subsection (4) excludes from the private residence exemption anyrealised development value accruing from any part of the house which hasbeen used exclusively for business purposes.
Subsection (5). If during the period of ownership changes have occurredeither to the house itself or in the part, if any, used for business purposes,the relief given by this section may be adjusted in a just and reasonablemanner.Subsection (6) gives the exemption in cases where trustees dispose ofa house which has been the only or main residence of a person entitled to occupy it under the terms of the settlement or entitled to the whole of theincome from or the sale proceeds of that house.Subsection (7). If up to the date of his death a deceased person hadsatisfied the conditions for the private residence exemption, his personalrepresentatives will enjoy the same exemption provided that they dispose of the house within 2 years of his death.Subsection (8). A deceased person may be regarded as having beeneligible for the private residence exemption at the date of his death, eventhough he had not owned nor occupied his residence for at least 6 months.The other tests in subsection (3) must be satisfied.Subsection (9). The period of ownership begins when an individualfirst acquires an interest in the land entitling him to possession.Clause 13.   Development of land held as stock in tradeSubsection (1). An individual or company is exempt from DLT inrespect of development value realised from an interest in land held as stockin trade on 12 September 1974 with planning permission in force at thatdate. (For this purpose, outline planning permission will normally suffice see Schedule 5).Subsection (2). The exemption referred to in subsection (1) is limited tothe amount of any development value which could have been realised atthe date of disposal within the terms of that planning permission.Subsections (3) and (4). Where the interest in land referred to in sub-section (1) is an option which has been exercised, the amount of develop-ment value which could be realised is calculated on the assumption that thatoption was still in existence at the date of disposal. Where the interest is a lease which before the date of disposal, has merged into the interest beingdisposed of, the development value which could be realised is calculated onthe assumption that, at the date of disposal, the lease was still in existence(provided that it would not have expired by the date of disposal).Subsections (5) to (7). Where an interest in land devolves on the per-sonal representatives of a deceased person or is acquired by gift or inherit-ance, the previous owner&apos;s stock in trade exemption is not lost.Subsection (8). An interest in land is deemed to be stock in trade if, onthe sale of such interest at 12 September 1974, the sale proceeds would havebeen included in the profits or gains of a trade carried on by the personhaving the interest.Subsection (9).   (a) The stock in trade exemption extends to land
acquired under a conditional contract entered into on or before 12 Septem-ber 1974.(b) gives effect to Schedule 5.Clause 14.  Exemptions related to projects of material developmentSubsection (1). DLT will not be chargeable on the deemed disposalof an interest in land at the start of a project of material development if that development is &quot; excluded development&quot; or certain conditions (defined in subsection (3) below) are satisfied.Subsection (2). &quot;Excluded development&quot; is (a) development which isnot relevant development for the purposes of the Community Land Act by virtue of section 4 of that Act (exemption for certain dwelling houses built by landowners for occupation by themselves or members of their families);and (b) development in Northern Ireland which would come within section4 of that Act if it extended to Northern Ireland.Subsection (3). Where it can be shown that no significant amount ofdevelopment value would have been realised if a project of material develop-ment had commenced immediately after the acquisition of an interest inland, no DLT will be charged in respect of that interest when the project in fact commences provided that the commencement is within2 years of acquisition;Subsections (4) to (7) set out the procedure for obtaining a notice fromthe Board, stating that a project will qualify for exemption under subsection(3).Clause 15.  Interaction with other taxesSubsection (1) introduces Schedule 6 which deals with the interaction ofDLT with other taxes. The draft schedule in Appendix A does not coversub-heads (c) and (d), nor the method of giving relief in cases under sub-heads (a) and (b) when the DLT occasion comes after the occasion giving rise to another tax. (See also the note on Schedule 6.)Subsection (2) precludes a deduction for DLT in computing businessprofits.Clause 16.  Duration of leases: effect of extensions, terminations andvariationsSubsection (1) provides the general rule for determining the duration ofa lease, namely that it is to be assumed that the tenant will exercise anyoption he has to extend its terms. (There are, however, separate rules for determing the duration of a lease for the purpose of deciding whether,under Clause 2, a lease is a major interest in land.)Subsection (2). If a lease continues beyond its presumed expiry date(see subsection (4)), the landlord is to be treated as having partly disposedof his interest by granting on the following day a new lease on conditionswhich accord with the facts.
Subsection (3). If a lease terminates on a day before its presumedexpiry date, the tenant is to be regarded as having surrendered it to the landlord on that day.Subsection (4). The presumed expiry date is to be the end of the termfound by Clause 16(1).Subsection (5). On the material variation of a lease (see subsection (6)),the tenant is to be assumed to have surrendered the lease and the landlordto have partly disposed of his interest by granting him a new lease on conditions which accord with the facts.Subsection (6). A lease is treated as having been materially varied if,on a disposal, its duration would be regarded as altered, or if restrictions onthe material development of the land are released or modified. (See also paragraph 16, Schedule 2.)Clause 17.   Time of disposal and acquisition of interests in landSubsection (1) introduces rules for determining times of disposal andacquisition.Subsection (2). Except for payments of compensation etc. which are recovered by Clause 3(2), the normal rule is that the time of disposal oracquisition under a contract is the time the contract is made.Subsection (3). If the contract is conditional (e.g. on the exercise of an option) disposal and acquisition are treated as taking place when the condi-tion is satisfied.Subsection (4). The time of disposal and acquisition by compulsory purchase is when the compensation is settled (disregarding variations on appeal) or, if earlier, the date of entry (but see subsection (7)).Subsection (5). A conditional contract entered into before 13 September1974 is to be regarded for the purposes of the disposal as never havingbeen conditional if the consideration for the disposal does not dependwholly or mainly on the value of the interest when the condition is satisfied.Subsection (6) deals with the situation where a firm arrangement toenter into a contract for a disposal was made before 13 September 1974and the disposal takes place during the year beginning on the appointed day. If unconditional, the contract is to be treated for the purposes of thedisposal as having been made before the appointed day. If the contract was conditional, it is to be treated for those purposes as having been enteredinto before 13 September 1974.Subsection (7). A disposal by compulsory purchase is to be treated as having been made before the appointed day if notice to treat was (or is deemed to have been) served before 13 September 1974.Subsection (8).   Subsections (5) to (7) do not affect times of acquisition.
Subsection (9) makes it clear that the clause does not affect times ofdisposal and acquisition for the purposes of other taxes.Subsection (10) defines the expression &quot; authority exercising compulsory powers &quot; which is used in subsections (4) and (7).Clause 18.   Interests in landSubsection (1). &quot; Interest in land &quot; is defined widely. It includes anyestate or interest in land and any right in or over land or affecting its useor disposition e.g., a restrictive covenant against development.Subsection (2). &quot; Interest in land&quot; does not, however, include theinterest of a creditor whose debt is secured by way of mortgage, an agree-ment for a mortgage or a charge of any kind over land. The exclusion forcreditors does not extend to a right to income secured on land by way of arent charge.Subsection (3). &quot; Lease&quot; is defined so as to include inter alia anagreement to grant a lease or sublease at some future date.Clause 19.   PartnershipsThis Clause provides that development value realised by persons carryingon a trade or business in partnership will be assessed and charged on thepartners separately, and any partnership dealings will be treated as dealingsby the partners and not by the partnership. This corresponds to the treat-ment of partnerships for capital gains tax.Clause 20.   InterpretationThis clause contains definitions and interpretations of the various termsused and enactments referred to in the legislation.Clause 21.The appointed day for DLT is to be prescribed by Order of theTreasury, subject to an affirmative resolution of the House of Commons.
PROJECTS OF MATERIAL DEVELOPMENTPart I General provisionsPara. 1 defines &quot; project of material development &quot;.Para. 2(1) sets out the rules for determining the date on which material development is to be treated as having begun.(2) lists the &quot; specified operations &quot; the start of which is regarded asbeginning the project of material development. A change of use whichconstitutes development is included.Para. 3. [It may happen that after a project of material development has begun, it will be carried out in such a way as to include some additionalmaterial development. There will be rules for determining whether thisshould be regarded as a new and separate project or as a variation of theexisting one. It is intended that these rules should be included at this pointin the Schedule.]Para. 4. Where material development has been carried out in accordancewith planning permission granted for a limited period only and the periodof the limited permission is subsequently extended, a new project is to bedeemed to have commenced as from the date of the extension.Para. 5(1). A project of material development is to comprise all thedevelopment and clearing operations which are to be, or have been, carriedout and is to comprise all the land which is to be, or has been, so developedor cleared (but no other land).(2) provides that the land comprised in the project is to include landancillary to and for occupation with a building if such land would not otherwise be included in the project.(3) and (4) are concerned with a development which consists solely ofa change of use of a hereditament or part of a hereditament. The landcomprised in the project is taken to be the whole of the &quot; hereditament&quot;which is defined as the aggregate of all the land and buildings which forma single entry in the valuation list or roll in force at the time of the disposal.Para. 6. Any expressions used but not defined in this legislation whichare derived from the relevant planning enactments (see Clause 20) are tohave the meanings assigned to them in those enactments.Part II Deemed disposalsPara. 7(1). In arriving at the market value of an interest in land wherematerial development is to be carried out, it is to be assumed that the carrying out of the development would be lawful, that it will be carried out and that planning permission would not be granted for any new material development which is not comprised in the project.   Account is to be taken
of any conditions imposed by planning permission authorising the project:for example, a planning permission might be for a limited period only,after which the land must revert to its previous use; or permission mightbe given to erect a house for occupation only by someone engaged in aparticular trade. In calculating market value no account is to be taken ofthe incumbrances listed in sub-paragraph (2) on the commencement of a project of material development (but see also paragraph 8, Schedule 1).(2) lists the incumbrances referred to in sub-paragraph 7(1).Para. 8(1) and (2). On the commencement of a project of material development the incumbrances listed in sub-paragraph 7(2) above are treated as a contingent liability (see paragraph 21, Schedule 2) assumed bythe owner of the interest affected by the incumbrance. Where that ownerincurs any expenditure in ridding himself of the incumbrance, such expenditure will be allowed to reduce the market value of his interest atthe date of the deemed disposal.Para. 9. Where a project of material development extends to only part of the land in which a major interest is held, in arriving at the market value (for the purposes of the deemed disposal and reacquisition) it is tobe assumed that the interest extends only to the part being developed.
REALISED DEVELOPMENT VALUE-SUPPLEMENTARYPROVISIONSPart I Disposals out of assembled landDate and cost of acquisitionPara. 1(1) and (2) explain that the first part of this Schedule sets outrules for determining liability on the disposal of an interest in land whichhas been built up by a number of acquisitions at different times.(3). Where the interest includes a lease which has merged with other interests, the merged lease is to be treated as remaining in existence untilthe presumed expiry date (see Clause 16(4)).Para. 2. The date of acquisition is the last date a part of the assembledland was acquired and the cost of acquisition is the sum of the separateacquisition costs, but these rules are subject to paragraphs 4 and 5.Para. 3. In calculating expenditure on improvements or on relevantimprovements of the assembled land, the amounts which would have beenattributable to the separate parts if they had been separately disposed of atthe time of the actual disposal are to be aggregated.IDetermination of Base APara. 4(a) provides that the current use value of each part making upthe assembled land should be calculated separately at the date of itsacquisition (or 6 April 1965, if later).(b). The aggregate of the current use values obtained under paragraph3(a) is to be treated as the current use value of the assembled land at date of acquisition or 6 April 1965, if later (see paragraph 2 above).(c) and (d). Any part of the assembled land acquired before 1 May1977 will attract special addition (see Clause 6) on disposal. The acquisitioncosts of each of the merged interests are treated independently, eachattracting its own special addition according to the actual date of itsacquisition and each having its own independent maximum.Land acquired before July 1948Para. 5(1). This paragraph provides rules for dealing with cases wherepart of the assembled land was acquired before 1 July 1948 (the appointed day under the Town and Country Planning Act 1947) and part after.(2). In determining base A, any part of the assembled land acquiredbefore 1 July 1948 is deemed to have been acquired at a cost equal to its current use value at the date of disposal. The deemed cost does not attract the special addition (see Clause 6) normally provided for in base A.(3). Similarly, in determining base C the acquisition cost is deemedto be the current use value at the date of disposal. Normally base C takes account of any expenditure on improvements since acquisition but in this special case relevant improvements only (see paragraph 2, Schedule 3) are taken into account.
(4). Where, on disposal, the current use of the pre-July 1948 partneeds to be determined, it is to be assumed that the interests existing in theland have not changed since 1 July 1948, and, in particular, that any leasehas an unexpired term of the same length as it had on that date.Partial exemption from chargePara. 6(1) applies where a part of the assembled land would havequalified for the relief provided by Clause 9 (i.e., relief for interests acquired by gift or inheritance) if it had continued to exist as a separate entity.(2) and (3) provide for two calculations of the amount of development value which would have arisen on a disposal of the part as a separate entityat market value; one on the assumption that Clause 9 would apply and theother on the assumption that it would not. For both calculations, the base to be used is the one in fact used for the actual disposal.(4) and (5). The difference between these two amounts (which reflects the benefit that Clause 9 treatment would confer in respect of that part) is allowed against the development value realised on the assembly, providing that the assembly is completely disposed of.(6) and (7). If the assembly is partly disposed of, then the difference is reduced by applying the part disposal fraction given in paragraph 9(1),Schedule 2.Para. 7(1). This paragraph applies where a part of the assembled land would have qualified for the &quot; stock in trade &quot; relief provided by Clause13, if it had continued to exist as a separate entity.(2). The amount of realised development value which would havequalified for such relief on a disposal of the part as a separate entity at market value is calculated using the same base as is used for the assembly.(3). Where the assembly is completely disposed of the amount ascer-tained under sub-paragraph (2) (i.e., the Clause 13 relief attributable to that part) is allowed against the development value realised on the assembly.(4). If the assembly is partly disposed of the amount is reduced by applying the part disposal fraction given in paragraph 9(1), Schedule 2.Part II Part disposalsPara. 8 introduces the rules for dealing with part disposals (seeClause 3).Para. 9(1). Except where they can be separately identified (see para-graph 10 below), the cost of the part disposed of (including for the purposeof special addition under base A) and the amount of any expenditure onrelevant improvements or improvements to that part are to be arrived at by apportionment of the figures applying to the whole of the interest inland.   In each case, the full figure is to be multiplied by the fraction:Net proceeds of the part disposal (PD)Net proceeds of part disposal   +   Market value of remainder(PD) (MR)
(2). The amounts arrived at under sub-paragraph (1) are to be deducted from the amounts relating to the whole interest in land to determine theamounts attributable to the part retained on any subsequent disposal ofthat part.(3). In the case of a gift or a transfer for a consideration below market value, the net proceeds of the part disposal (PD) in the apportionment isto be determined as if the interest forming the subject of the part disposalhad been disposed of at market value.Para. 10(1). Except where it can be clearly identified, the current use value at the date of disposal of the part disposed of is arrived at bydeducting from the current use value of the whole interest in land (CW)the current use value of the part remaining after the part disposal (CR).(2). For the purposes of base A, the current use value at the date of acquisition or, if later, 6 April 1965, of the part disposed of is found bymultiplying the current use value on acquisition of the whole interest bythe fraction:CW CRCW(3). The balance of the original current use value remaining after deducting the amount produced after the calculation referred to in sub-paragraph 10(2) above has been carried out will, for the purposes of any future disposal of the part remaining, be the current use value at acquisitionor 6 April 1965, if later.Para. 11. Where on the occasion of a part disposal of an interest inland it is possible to distinguish the current use value (at dates of acquisition and disposal) or expenditure incurred (including acquisition costs) inrespect of the part being disposed of, such amounts are to be used instead ofof the amounts derived from the use of the formulae in paragraphs 9 and10 above.Part III Additional provisions applicable to leases and reversions onleasesIntroductionThe note on Clause 3(1) indicated that the grant of a lease is treatedas a part disposal for DLT. Part III of Schedule 2 makes the necessary adaptations to Part II (which contains the basic provisions on part disposals)where development value is realised by leasing land at a rent, with or with-out a premium. The process of arriving at the consideration given for thegrant of a lease involves capitalisation of rents (dealt with in Part V of theSchedule see note on paragraphs 23 and 24). There is consequently asystem of deductions from and additions to the various items which featurein the calculation of liability to DLT on the disposal, part disposal ordeemed disposal of leases and reversions. Items requiring these adjust-ments are the consideration, the market value and the current use valueat acquisition or on 6 April 1965 as appropriate, and at disposal. Forexample, on the sale of a reversion the consideration given by the purchaserwill reflect the value of the right to receive the rent reserved in the lease.The element of development value in the rent will have been charged toDLT on the grant of the lease and for DLT purposes a deduction equal
to the value of the right to receive the rent for the unexpired term of the lease is therefore made from the actual amount of the consideration. This,with other necessary adjustments, in effect confines the DLT charge on thedisposal of the reversion to any development value attributable to the rightof the reversioner to re-occupy the land at the end of the lease.Similarly, when a lessee assigns a lease, an adjustment is needed to theactual consideration. This consideration will take into account the under-taking by the assignee of the obligation to pay the rent. For the purpose ofcomputing the assignors DLT liability, the value of that obligation isadded to the consideration actually received by him, since his own acquisi-tion cost will include the value of the obligation to pay rent.Paragraphs 12 to 15 set out the necessary adjustments. They deal with separate aspects of these adjustments but they are not mutually exclusiveand so, for example, on the grant of a sub-lease out of a lease paragraphs12 and 13 will both be relevant.Grant of a leasePara. 12(1) provides that on the grant of a lease the market value and current use value of the retained interest (&quot; MR &quot; and &quot; CR &quot; in paragraphs9 and 10, Schedule 2), i.e., the reversion on the lease, shall be reduced by&quot; the value immediately after the grant of the landlords rights under the lease &quot;.(2) defines the value of the landlords rights under the lease so as toinclude everything except the right to recover possession when the leaseexpires. Thus it will include not only rents but also, for example, any works the lessee has agreed to carry out which benefit the landlord.The combined effect of (1) and (2) is therefore to leave as the market and current use values of the retained interest only the market and currentuse values of the right of the reversioner to re-occupy the land at the endof the lease.Part disposal of a leasePara. 13(1) explains that this paragraph deals with part disposals of leases. Where the part disposal is the grant of a sub-lease out of a lease,paragraph 12(1) also applies.(2) provides that to the market value and current use value of theretained interest there should be added the value of the rights of thechargeable persons landlord under the lease. Additions will also havebeen made to the chargeable persons cost of acquiring the lease which isnow the subject of the part disposal. (See paragraph 15(2)).(3). In line with the provisions in (1) and (2) above, in determining thecurrent use value of the lease at the time of the part disposal or at thetime of its acquisition (&quot; CW &quot; in paragraph 10(1), Schedule 2) account isto be taken only of the value of the lessees right to occupy the land untilthe lease expires (i.e. his obligation to pay rent is disregarded).(4) provides that where the lease out of which the part disposal ismade has less than 50 years to run at the time of part disposal, base C shallnot be available tq the chargeable person (i.e., the owner of the lease) andbase A will take into account any fall in current use value since the dateof acquisition.
Disposal or Part disposal of a reversionPara. 14 deals with disposals (including part disposals) of an interest inland which, immediately before the disposal, is in reversion on a lease.(1) provides that, in the case of a complete disposal, the items set out in(a), (b) and (c) (i.e. net proceeds of disposal, current use value on disposaland cost of acquisition for the person acquiring the reversion) are all to be adjusted by deducting the value of the rights of the landlord (i.e. the person who owns the interest). There are modifications for part disposals seesub-paragraphs (2) and (3) below.(2) provides that where there is a part disposal involving the giving upof part of the land (Clause 3 (l)(b)) then the net proceeds of disposal, and cost of acquisition of the person acquiring the granted interest, are to bereduced by an appropriate part only of the value of the rights of the land-lord.(3). Where there is a part disposal which does not involve thecreation of an interest in land (Clause 3 (2)) then no adjustment is to bemade to the net proceeds of disposal since these will not reflect the valueof any right to receive rents. Similarly, as no interest in land has been acquired, sub-paragraph (l)(c) does not apply.(4) provides that where there is a part disposal the market value and current use value of the part retained (i.e., the reversioner&apos;s retained interest)should be reduced by an amount equal to the value of the rights of the re-versioner under the existing lease, to the extent that these rights areretained by him following the part disposal. This parallels the treatment ofthese values on the grant of a new lease (see paragraph 12 (1)).(5). Where, in the case of a complete disposal, the reversion disposedof was a reversion at the date of its acquisition or 6 April 1965 then thecurrent use value at that date is to be reduced by the value at that time ofthe rights of the reversioner to receive rent etc. under the lease (thus leav-ing only the current use value of the right to re-occupy the land at the endof the lease).Complete disposal of a leasePara. 15 deals with the complete disposal of leases (i.e., assignment orsurrender); for part disposals of leases see paragraph 13.(1) and (2) increase the net proceeds of disposal, and cost of acquisitionof the person acquiring the lease, by the value of the landlords rights underthe lease. As explained in the introductory note to this Part of theSchedule, the addition to the net proceeds of disposal is made because thedisposer^ own acquisition cost will include the value of the obligation topay rent. The cost of acquisition of the person acquiring the lease is -similarly increased. (For cost of acquisition on the grant of a lease seeparagraph 23.)(3).  This rule parallels that in paragraph 13(3).(4). This applies the &quot; wasting &quot; rule in paragraph 13(4) to completedisposals of leases.
Para. 16(1) introduces rules to supplement the provisions in Clause16(5) concerning material variations of leases.(2) provides that where a tenant would realise development value on the assumed surrender of his original lease, the amount is to be set primarilyagainst the deemed cost of his acquisition of the assumed new lease, anybalance remaining being subject to DLT.(3). Any consideration given by the tenant for the variation is to betreated as relating to the grant of the new lease rather than the surrender ofthe original lease.(4) and (5). If the base value on the surrender is higher than the netproceeds of disposal, then the balance is added to the cost of acquisition ofthe new lease, but is not to attract special addition.Part IV Projects: temporary or partial developmentPara. 17(1). Where a project of material development extends to only part of the land in which an interest is held, paragraph 9 of Schedule 1provides that, in arriving at market value, that interest should be regardedas extending only to the part being developed. This sub-paragraph intro-duces a similar assumption for determining the base value and provides thatacquisition costs, expenditure and current use value on acquisition or dis-posal, should be apportioned accordingly.(2). In such a case it is also necessary to calculate the base value ofthe whole interest as a step towards determining the cost of its deemed re-acquisition, which would be treated as the cost of acquisition for a sub-sequent disposal of the whole interest. Any excess of the base value of thewhole over the base value determined under sub-paragraph (1) is to beadded to the cost at which it is deemed to be acquired. (See also Clause 6(5)and (6) regarding special addition.)Para. 18. Where, on the deemed disposal of an interest in land, the base value exceeds the net proceeds of that disposal (e.g., because the projectis a temporary one which does not exhaust the development value paid for),an amount equal to the excess is to be added to the cost at which it is deemed to be acquired.Part V ConsiderationPreliminaryPara. 19 explains that this part of the Schedule sets out rules forarriving at the amounts of consideration for the disposal and acquisitionof an interest in land and lays down the principle that, except where thereis express provision to the contrary, in any one transaction these amountswill be held to be the same.General rulesPara. 20(1). The amount of the consideration given or received is notto be discounted for any delay in payment nor, initially, for the risk of non-payment.
(2). If any part of the consideration in fact becomes irrecoverable theBoard of Inland Revenue are to make any necessary adjustments.Para. 21(1). Consideration for the disposal of an interest in land isinitially to take no account of any contingent liability.(2) provides for an appropriate adjustment if a contingent liability is infact enforced.Para. 22(1) and (2). A deduction is allowable for overseas tax in calculating the consideration for the disposal of an interest in land, but theconsideration for the acquisition of the interest is not affected.Rents and other income paymentsParas 24and25 The consideration for the grant of a lease is the capital value of the right to receive the rents (assuming that the tenant will meethis obligations) and any other consideration payable in respect of that grant.Para. 25. Without prejudice to the rules about the grant of a lease,the amount of any consideration which consists of a series of income pay-commitments  is taken to be the market value of the right to receive those payments.OptionsPara. 26(1) and (2). Clause 3(4) provides that the grant of an option isthe creation of a separate interest in land. Nevertheless if an option is exercised, the grant of the option and the disposal (or acquisition) of theinterest in land by the grantor are treated as a single transaction.(3) provides equivalent rules to (2) above for the person who exercisesthe option and indicates that the abandonment of an option is not the dis-posal of an interest in land.Part VI Incidental costs-Para. 27 explains what is to be regarded as expenditure incidental to theacquisition or disposal of an interest in land.
Expenditure on improvementsPara. 1(1). Expenditure on improvements must have been wholly andexclusively incurred by the owner of an interest in land either (a) for thepurpose of adding to the value of that interest (and the expenditure mustbe reflected in the condition of the land or the market value of the interest at the time of disposal), or (b) in maintaining his legal title to that interestand his right to enjoy it.(2). Expenditure of recurrent nature, such as on maintenance, is excluded.(3). Expenditure is to be apportioned where it also benefits land otherthan that land in which the relevant interest subsists.Para. 2. Expenditure on relevant improvements is defined as the amountof expenditure on improvements less any resulting increase in the currentuse value of the interest in land at the date of disposal.Para. 3(1) applies where the planning permission authorising the develop-ment of a particular piece of land imposes a condition which causes thecurrent use value of other land in the same ownership to fall e.g., a condi-lion that a house should revert from office to domestic use.(2). In such a case, the current use value of the interest in the &quot; other &quot;land is ascertained ignoring the planning conditions and, if that exceeds itsactual current use value (i.e., after taking account of the planning condi-tions) when the development is carried out, any excess is allowable as ex-penditure on improvements.Para. 4. Where paragraph 3 above applies then, when the interest inthe &quot; other &quot; land is disposed of, the aggregate of items making up base Ais to be reduced by the smaller of the amount already allowed under sub-paragraph 3(2)(b) above and the fall in current use value between date of acquisition, or 6 April 1965 if later, and date of disposal. Base C is notavailable as a base value for the interest in the &quot; other &quot; land.Para. 5. Where the condition attaching to the planning permissionreferred to in sub-paragraph 3(1) above is varied or removed within 6years of the disposal, the fresh situation is to be regarded as having existedfrom the outset and any consequential adjustments to DLT assessments areto be made.
Development which is not &quot;material development&apos;Para. 1(1) lists a number of activities which do not constitute material development for DLT purposes (see Clause 7(4)).(2) There are references in sub-paragraph (1) to &quot;relevant time&quot;. This means the date for valuation when current use value is being determined and the dateof the first specified operation (see paragraph 2, Schedule 1) for determiningwhen a project of material development is begun.(3) provides rules for determining whether an enlargement or rebuilding ismaterial development where more than one building is involved (see paragraphl(l)(a) and (b), which exclude from material development enlargement andrebuilding which does not increase the cubic content of a building by more than10 per cent).Para. 2(1) and (2) These sub-paragraphs provide that, as regards the 10per cent, enlargement and rebuilding tolerance, any increase in cubic content dueto the provision of fire escapes, car parking facilities and accommodation forheating and air conditioning plant is to be disregarded.(3) Where a building has been enlarged or rebuilt after 1 July 1948, the10 per cent, tolerances for any subsequent enlargement or rebuilding refer to theoriginal building on which the works were carried out and not the buildingresulting from these earlier works.Para .3 specifies the classes within which changes of use do not constitutematerial development.Para. 4. Where it is necessary to determine what part of a building has aparticular use (see paragraph 1(1 )(g) of Schedule 4), any part of the buildingnot so used on 1 July 1948 or on the date when such use was introduced, which-ever is the later, is disregarded.Para. 5 defines various terms used in the Schedule.
Authorised developmentPara. 1. In determining for the purposes of Clause 13 (stock in tradeexemption) what planning permission was in force on 12th September, 1974, anapplication for planning permission which was refused before that date but was subsequently granted on appeal is regarded as having been granted on the dateof the original refusal.Para. 2. Where the planning permission in force at 12th September,1974, was outline planning permission only, the exemption from DLT pro-vided for in Clause 13 applies to any development authorised by that per-mission without the need for later approval. The exemption also applies to development for which approval was granted before the disposal or might reasonably have been expected to be granted, other than development for whichapproval had been refused.Para. 3. Where planning permission, although in force at 12th September,1974, was for a limited period only and had lapsed by the time of disposal, it isregarded as not having been in force at 12th September, 1974.Para. 4 defines various terms used in the Schedule.NoteUnder the Planning^(Northern Ireland) Order 1974 (S.I. 1972 No 1634) alloutline planning permissions in Northern Ireland granted before 1st September,1971 lapsed on 1st September, 1974, unless implementation had begun ordetailed plans were submitted before that date. It is proposed that in NorthernIreland the exemption for interests in land held as stock in trade should be givenwhere planning permission was held at 1st September, 1974, and would also have been held at 12th September, 1974, but for the operation of the Plan-ning (Northern Ireland) Order 1972.
Interaction of DLT with other taxesPara. 1 defines certain terms used in this Schedule.Reduction of chargeable gain by reference to realised development value.Para. 2(1). Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) to (7), where a DLT disposal isalso a disposal for the purposes of CGT, then the amount of the chargeablerealised development value (i.e. the amount actually charged to DLT) is deducted from the chargeable gain.(2). Where the consideration for the purposes of DLT is greater than theconsideration for the purposes of CGT (e.g. where DLT falls on income itemssuch as rents which are excluded from the CGT consideration) then, for thepurposes of (1) above, the chargeable realised development value is reduced byCGT considerationapplying the fraction:-DLT consideration(3) and (4). Where the reduction in (2) has been made, then on a subsequentdisposal (e.g. the sale of a reversion where the first disposal was the grant of a lease) a similar calculation is made, but with the CGT consideration for the subsequent disposal added to that on the first disposal. The excess of the amountof chargeable realised development value obtained by this reduction over thatobtained by applying (2) is deducted from the chargeable gain. This process canbe repeated for any further disposals; for this purpose, a CGT disposal which isnot also a DLT disposal is to be treated as such.(5) restricts the operation of (3) and (4) so that no more than the full amount of the chargeable realised development value which accrued on theDLT disposal can be offset against chargeable gains.(6). The deduction from the chargeable gain is to be made before the adjustments and reductions listed in (a), (b) and (c) are carried out.(7). The deduction from the chargeable gain is not allowed to establish a loss.Para. 3. Where there is a deemed disposal on the commencement of a project of material development, the rules in sub-paragraph 2(2) et seq areapplied when there are subsequent CGT disposals (which may or may not beDLT disposals). Thus the full amount of chargeable development value realisedon the deemed disposal is available to be applied against subsequent CGTdisposals, together with any realised on those subsequent disposals. For the pur-poses of the fraction in sub-paragraph 2(2), the denominator is the aggregate ofthe DLT consideration on the deemed disposal and any expenditure incurredbefore the subsequent CGT disposal which would be treated for DLT purposes has expenditure on improvements (e.g. construction costs).Para. 4(1) and (2). Where a gain arising on the disposal of business assetsor other assets qualifying under Section 33, Finance Act 1965, is rolled overwholly or partly by reducing the acquisition costs of new assets, the chargeablerealised development value is primarily applied against any remaining chargeablegain with any unapplied balance being carried forward. In this case the amount
of chargeable realised development value available for offset against chargeablegains is not restricted to the amount of the chargeable gain on the disposal(as in paragraph 2(7) above) but is restricted to the amount which would be thechargeable gain if the roll over provisions did not apply.(3). The balance carried forward is applied against any chargeable gainsarising on the disposal of the new assets until the whole of the balance has been exhausted.(4). Where a gain is held over as a result of the acquisition of a depreciatingasset (defined in paragraph 16(7), Schedule 19, Finance Act 1969) the unappliedbalance of chargeable development value is set off against the gain when thatgain is treated as accruing. Where that gain is reduced as a result of a claimfollowing the acquisition of an asset which is not a depreciating asset (&quot;asset No.3&quot;) the unapplied balance is available for offset against any chargeable gainarising on the disposal of that asset.(5). The deduction under this paragraph from a chargeable gain is not allowed to establish a loss.(6)   contains definitions of terms used in this paragraph.Reduction of profits or gains by reference to realised development value.Para. 5(1). Where a DLT disposal is also a trading disposal (see paragraph1), then the amount of the chargeable realised development value is deducted from the profits or gains of the trade.(2) and (3) provide parallel rules to those in sub-paragraphs (2) to (5) ofparagraph 2.Para. 6. Sets out modifications to paragraph 5 to deal with the case wherethe DLT disposal is a deemed disposal. The modifications are equivalent to thosein paragraph 3 (see note on that paragraph).NoteParagraphs 1 to 6 above provide rules for interactions where a DLT disposalcoincides with or precedes a disposal for the purposes of tax on chargeable gainsor on trading profits. Rules will also be proposed for interactions where these other taxes precede the DLT disposal.Where there is a DLT disposal of an interest in land and that interest hadbeen charged to estate duty or capital transfer tax within the 6 years prior to thedisposal, then it is proposed to deduct from the realised development value theamount of estate duty or capital transfer tax attributable to that value. Appro-priate relief will also be proposed for capital transfer tax paid by the transfereein respect of a transfer to him at under value (i.e. an acquisition which is not&quot;otherwise than for value&quot; see Clause 9).
APPENDIX CNOTES ON ASPECTS OF DEVELOPMENT LAND TAX not covered IN APPENDICES A AND B(The numbered paragraphs below are extracts from the Inland Revenue notice of 4th February, 1975)Acquisition of land by local authoritiesIn the White Paper &quot;Land&quot;, the Government announced their intention of enabling local authorities to buy land net of the development land tax thatwould have been payable by the vendor had he sold his land privately. Thearrangements for giving effect to this intention are still under discussion withrepresentatives of the local authorities.CharitiesAs indicated in Paragraph 5(c) of this White Paper, the Government will propose that development value realised by charities from interests in land heldat 12th September, 1974 should be exempt from DLT. The exemption willextend to any interest held by a charity at that date, including both endowmentland and land held for functional purposes. The exemption will not howeverextend to interests in the same land held by persons other than a charity.In consequence a charity will be free either to sell or develop land in which itheld an interest at 12th September, 1974 without becoming liable to DLT inrespect of that interest. If such an interest is acquired by an authority, the charitywill receive full market value and there will be no deduction on account of DLT.If the interest is disposed of to a person other than an authority, the charity willnot be required to pay DLT on any development value realised in consequence.A charity will, however, be liable to DLT on any development value realised ondisposing of an interest in land acquired after 12th September, 1974.As already announced, a charity will not be liable to DLT on developingland for its own use. This exemption for development for a charity&apos;s own usewill apply whether the interest in the land was acquired before or after 12thSeptember, 1974.Transitional arrangements4. As stated in the White Paper DLT will replace the arrangements for the taxation of development gains introduced in the Finance Act 1974 and currently in force. Thedevelopment gains charge will continue to apply to disposals before the Appointed Daybut not to subsequent disposals unless material development commenced before theAppointed Day. In the latter case the charge on development gains will apply, sincethe value of the material development so commenced will not be chargeable to DLT.5. The White Paper did not specifically refer to the future of the charge on the firstletting of a non-residential building following material development which was intro-duced by Chapter II, Part III, Finance Act 1974. It has been decided that with theintroduction of DLT, the charge in such circumstances will be discontinued for firstSettings after the Appointed Day, except where the material development commencedbefore that day.10. Material development started, but not completed, before the Appointed Day willbe treated as having commenced before the Appointed Day (and so not within thecharge to DLT) to the extent that the carrying out of the project was authorised byplanning permission in force at the Appointed Day.
The reference in paragraph 5 above to &quot;material development commencedbefore that day&quot; should be taken as a reference to the material developmentfrom which the building resulted (ie &quot;the relevant development&quot; as denned insection 46(1), Finance Act 1974). It follows that there will not be a charge underPart III, Finance Act 1974 on the first letting after the Appointed Day of a building commenced after that day even though the project of development ofwhich it is part may have commenced earlier.Collection arrangements13. Where the occasion of charge is the commencement of material development, orthe consideration for a disposal takes the form of rent, there will be opportunity forspreading payment of the tax over a period (subject to interest).The draft legislation does not at present include provisions about the pay-ment of DLT. The intention is that the payable date should be a short period after the chargeable occasion. Interest will be charged from the pay-able date up to the date of payment, at the rate prescribed for interest onarrears of income tax. If part of the tax or interest is subsequently repaid,the repayment will carry interest from the date on which the payment was made.There will be an opportunity for a person who becomes chargeable to DLTbefore he receives the cash benefit from the realisation of development value (e.g. when he begins a project of material development see clause 2)to pay the tax by instalments (subject to interest).Groups of companies26. A transfer of land from one company to another which is a member of the samegroup will not be an occasion for charging DLT. Liability will, however, arise whenland is disposed of outside the group and in that case regard will be had to its cost tothe group (and not to any transfer prices within the group). Special rules will beprovided to cover the situation where a company ceases to be a member of a group.27. A group will be a 75 per cent, group as for the purposes of taxing capital gains(broadly a principal company and all its 75 per cent, subsidiaries) but for DLT purposesa non-resident company may qualify as a member of a group.Trusts28. Where land is held by a trustee for a beneficiary who is absolutely entitled to it asagainst the trustee, the land will be deemed to be vested in the beneficiary and anythingdone with the land by the trustee will be regarded as having been done by the beneficiary.Transfers of land between a bare trustee and a beneficiary absolutely entitled to it willbe disregarded. ......29. Special provision will also be made for charging disposals of certain interests intrusts, if the main asset of the trust is land. These provisions will apply where thesettled property comprises land (including land held as trading stock or occupied bytrustees for use in a trade carried on by them) to a value exceeding 75 per cent, of thenet value of all the settled property.Housing Associations and the Housing Corporation38. Approved co-operative housing associations (as defined in Section 341, Income andCorporation Taxes Act 1970) and self-build societies (as defined in Section 12, housing act 1974) will not be liable to DLT on the erection or disposal of dwellings. Nor willthere be liability on the disposal of surplus land to a housing association registered withthe Housing Corporation under Section 13, Housing Act 1974, or to the housing corporation itself. These approved associations and societies will, however, be liableto DLT (subject to the relief described in paragraphs 30 and 31 above) [exemption for first  5,000 of development value] on disposing of surplus land to other purchasers.
39. Other registered housing associations (including those which are registered ascharities) will not be charged on the erection of dwellings, but if they dispose of land orbuildings other than to another registered housing association or to the housing corporation DLT will be chargeable (subject to the relief described in paragraphs 30and 31 above) on any development value realised (including any value realised at thetime any buildings sold were erected, but not charged on that occasion). The housing corporation will be treated similarly.40. There will be no special reliefs for unregistered housing associations.Statutory Undertakers45. As stated in the White Paper, statutory undertakers and other comparable bodieswill be able to carry out development for their own operational use without liability toDLT, but they will be liable (subject to the relief described in paragraphs 30 and 31above) when they dispose of their land, whether before or after development. Wherethere is a subsequent disposal of land so developed DLT will be chargeable on any development value realised (including any value realised at the time the development for operational use was commenced, but not charged to DLT on that occasion).Industry46. The White Paper stated that the arrangements for collecting DLT would be framedin such a way as to minimise the risk of difficulty for firms then owning land on whichthey plan to extend for their own use. It has been decided that there should be a more comprehensive relief for industry. The relief will apply to the development for industrialuse of land whenever acquired and to new industrial buildings as well as to extensions to existing buildings.47. The legislation will have the general effect that an industrialist will not be liable]toDLT on material development of land owned by him if that development is for his ownindustrial use (including the provision of welfare facilities).48. There will, however, be liability to DLT when land so developed is disposed of(unless the disposal takes place within a group of companies) or ceases to be used bythe industrialist for industrial purposes. In such cases DLT will be chargeable (subjectto the relief described in paragraphs 30 and 31 above) on any development valuerealised (including any value realised at the time the development for industrial use wascommenced, but not charged to DLT on that occasion).Minerals50. Disposals of land with planning permission to win and work minerals will be chargeable. The charge will, however, be reduced (on the lines of the reduced charge on development gains in the Finance Act 1974) so that it will apply to only 50 per cent, ofthe excess of the consideration over what the market value of the land would be on theassumption that planning permission would not be granted for the winning and workingof minerals.51. Development consisting of the winning and working of minerals will not be an occasion of charge for DLT.52. The arrangements for taxing mineral royalties introduced in the Finance Act 1970will not be disturbed.Avoidance57. As announced in the White Paper, the legislation will guard against transactionsaimed at avoidance in the period before the introduction of DLT, in particular attempts to establish an artificially high base value. No detailed statement about these provisionscan be made in advance of the legislation. So far as possible, however, they will be framed so as not to affect bona fide transactions at arm&apos;s length during this period.Printed in England for Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office by Williams Lea, LondonDd 252817 K86 8/75
