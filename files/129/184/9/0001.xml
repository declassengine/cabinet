iiHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 84 COPY NO22 July 1975CABINETPEERS&apos; EXPENSES ALLOWANCEMemorandum by the Lord Privy seal. Like the allowances of Members of Parliament, the Peers&apos;Expenses Allowance is a reimbursement allowance:  that is to say, it is a daily limit within which Peers may reclaim actual expenditure incurred forattending sittings of the House of Lords.    The allowance was last increased from a maximum of  8, 50 a day to one of  11. 50 a day on 1 August 1974, atthe same time as Members of Parliament received increases in their various allowances.    This was the first increase since 1 January 1972.2. The whole question of the rates and conditions of payment of the allowance has been referred to the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB).Since it raises important general issues and the TSRB has a heavy workloadon other matters, the Review Body will not finally report on this question for some time,    hi the meantime, in a letter to the Prime Minister of27 June 1975, Lord Boyle has proposed on behalf of the TSRB that thereshould be an interim increase in the Allowance to a maximum of  13. 50 aday.    There were two reasons for this:  first, the TSRB had recommendedincreases in the allowances of Members of Parliament;  second, the costs which the peers Expenses Allowance was designed to cover had increasedquite substantially since 1 August 1974.3. I am convinced that an increase in the Allowance is now overdue,for the reasons given by Lord Boyle and in view of the increasingly heavy pressure on Members of the House of Lords.    The amount of the increaserecommended by the TSRB is about 17j per cent, and this is fairly modestcompared with the 28j per cent increase in the subsistence allowance(&quot;Additional Costs&apos; Allowance&quot;) of Members of Parliament which theGovernment has recently approved.    If the increase is agreed, it can be implemented by a resolution of the House of Lords only, and no action inthe House of Commons is required.1
RECOMMENDATION4. I invite my colleagues to agree to an interim increase in the Peers&apos;Expenses Allowance from a maximum of  11. 50 a day to one of  13. 50 a day with effect from 1 August 1975.civil Service Department22 July 19752
