THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPER.TY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 9922 September 1975CABINETINQUIRY INTO GAMBLINGMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. The Home Affairs Committee agreed at their meeting on 2 July thata Royal Commission should be appointed to carry out a wide-ranging inquiry into the existing laws of gambling and the practice thereunder: the proposed terms of reference are at Annex.    The Committee also agreed that theCommission should be asked to submit an interim report on the idea of alevy on the football pools, since particularly strong pressures are beingexerted for such a levy.2. The Prime Minister subsequently asked me to consider whether theproposed inquiry might better be conducted by a Select Committee, on thegrounds that the financial problems affecting sport were too urgent to be effectively hand-led within the wider context of an inquiry into gambling andthat to set up a Select Committee would politically be desirable.3. I do not wish to minimise the benefits which sport (and alsocharities, and the arts) may be able to derive from gambling profits, butthis is only one aspect of a larger subject with much wider economic and social ramifications and in my view should not be allowed to determine thewhole nature of the inquiry.    The many different manifestations ofgambling, the constant danger of criminality or fraud which surrounds it,the complexity of the law and the close interrelation between the social andeconomic factors require comprehensive examination by a body commandinga wider range of experience and specialised knowledge than a SelectCommittee could be expected to provide.    From experience of the manystrong and competing lobbies in this field, all well represented in the house and liable to be reflected in the composition of a Select Committee, I couldfeel no confidence that it would provide a sufficiently judicious forum for an inquiry of the kind required.    I therefore believe that the wisest course isto follow precedent by the appointment of a Royal Commission,copy NO   O I
