THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 88 COPY NO      8131 July 1975CABINETRESOURCE ALLOCATION AND PUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1974-79:SIZE OF PUBLIC SECTOR AND NON-INDUSTRIAL EMPLOYMENTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment. I have had two tables prepared, which may be of interest to mycolle ague s.I2.        It is often said that public expenditure in Britain is exceptionally high.    But the figures given in support of this include money spent on thepurchase of income-bearing assets.    If we take the current expenditureof Government as a percentage of gross national product (GNP), we derivethe following results from Organisation for Economic Co-operation andDevelopment (OECD) sources.TABLE IGENERAL GOVERNMENT^ CURRENT EXPENDITURE AS % OF GNPAT MARKET PRICES1955 1960 1965 1969 1973^(estimated)United Kingdom	28.5	28.9	30.1	32.8	33France	29.9	30.2	32.9	33.5	(35)Germany	27.0	28.3	30.7	32.0	35Sweden	26.0	28.6	31.8	37.4	(40)USA	22.4	24.9	25.1	28.9	30(a) Central and Local Government combined, excluding nationalised industries, but including social security funds.(b) No OECD comparisons available after 1969, because of the hiatuscaused by the switchover to the new system of National Accounts.1RESTRICTED
3,        United Kingdom current public expenditure in 1973 was similar asa proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) to France and Germanymuch less than Sweden, much more than the USA - a pattern that haspersisted over a long period.   Comparisons for 1974 are not av ilable;but the United Kingdom share could have been as much as 5 points higher.4,        Other interesting points are:i.        Excluding subsidies, transfers in the United Kingdom formed a small proportion of total current expenditure as compared withall Continental countries (but not the USA)*    Current use of resources by Government therefore took a higher share than inFrance or Germany.ii*        United Kingdom current grants were again a small proportionof household income as against Continental Europe (exceptSwitzerland), but not USA or Japan.iii. United Kingdom showed up badly in social expenditure as defined by European Economic Community (e.c.) (social services,health and social security, but excluding education and housing)against all e.c. countries except Ireland.    This is partly due tothe greater extension of private pensions in the United Kingdom(and to the lower relative pay of doctors).iv. A more detailed comparison with Germany shows that thehigh United Kingdom deficiency in social security is a little offset by housing.    But the United Kingdom spends more on defence andother public services outside the social field.II5.        It is also often said that the proportion of non-industrial employmentin Britain has grown exceptionally fast.    But if we define productiveemployment as including agriculture as well as industry we get thefollowing results (from International Labour Organisation sources),TABLE IIGROWTH IN 1962-73 IN THE PROPORTION OF NON-industrial employment TO:Industrial Agricultural PlusEmployment Industrial EmploymentJapan                                           3% 50%Italy                                           11% 39%W, Germany (1972)                     9% 19%France                                       24% 44%USA                                           24% 35%United Kingdom                         33% 33%A department of the Environment31 July 1975RESTRICTED
