Bis document is the property of her britannic majesty^ government(75) 79copy no      O 9U hi10 July 1975cabinetMEDIUM-TERM ASSESSMENT AND PUBLIC expenditure memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer.        When we discussed public expenditure in May this year on thebasis of my papers C(75) 62 and C(75) 63, I suggested that the level ofpublic expenditure by 1978-79 might need to be at least  2 billion at1974 prices below the White Paper projections, and might very well haveto be even lower: and that in the public expenditure survey officials shouldidentify cuts totalling  3 billion in order to provide sufficient room forthe Cabinet to make shifts in the present pattern of priorities if the Cabinetso wished.    I explained that, before the public expenditure survey was completed, we should have a further opportunity for considering thebalance between public and private expenditure, on the basis of the reportof the Medium-Term Assessment (MTA).    A paper by officials describing the preliminary results of the MTA has been circulated separately(C(75) 78); in this note I explain how I believe the MTA should influenceour decisions on the proportion of the nation&apos;s resources which public expenditure will pre-empt in the medium term,    (We shall be meeting to reconsider our priorities for public expenditure later this month.)2.        It must be our objective through a combination of fiscal andindustrial policies to increase the total of national resources faster thanthe MTA predicts, without producing price inflation on the current scale,so that our balance of payments target can be met without severe limits on the level of domestic spending.    But if we now based our plans for domestic spending on the assumption that we had already achieved this objective, we would risk being confronted continaully with the need to makeemergency cuts in our programmes as so often in the past.3.        It would also be wrong to base our plans on the assumption that weshould continue to borrow from foreigners up to the end of the decade.Even if we succeed in eliminating our balance of payments deficit by 1978as assumed by the MTA, our indebtedness will have increased substantially,by pearhaps  10- 15 billion.    The annual cost of servicing this debt wouldbe S.lj- 1% billion - a major burden on our balance of payments.
4. We are now embarking on a programme for reducing the rate of inflation which must be continued in some form for several years if weare to retain and extend the gains we hope to achieve by drastic restraint on incomes in the next twelve months.    We cannot now take our success in this field for granted.    To the extent that we fall short of our objectives,we are likely also to fall short of full employment.    So we cannot base our plans on the assumption that we will do better in making full use of our industrial capacity and manpower than we have done over the past fewyears - though this must certainly be our objective.5.        In any case it is difficult to imagine that we should plan onsuppressing the growth of real take-home pay for an indefinite period -though we must do so in the next twelve months.    The paper by officialsshown that privately-financed consumption cannot grow at an annual rateof as much ss 1 per cent a year over the period 1974-79 if we make noadjustment to the 1975 White Paper programmes beyond that announced inmy Budget Statement for the year 1976-77.6.        If we expect working people to show severe restraint in wage claims for a period of years, we must be able to assure them of some reasonablegrowth in their own real take-home pay.    To limit the growth ofprivately-financed consumption to 1 per cent a year would require sharpincreases in tax rates.    The official paper suggests that, on current expenditure programmes, the vast mass of ordinary people would, by1979, be paying tax at the marginal rate of about 50 pence in *he pound ifwe include income-related social security payments with income tax.7.        I cannot believe that this level of direct taxation is compatible with the degree of wage restraint we require if we are to control inflation.To raise the money by indirect taxes would be even more damaging towage restraint.8. These arguments concerning the balance of resources are reinforced by arguments derived from the financial balance.    As I have explainedbefore, it is not possible over a run of years for the excess of public spending over public revenue to be greater than the excess of savings overinvestment in the two private sectors of the economy, if the externalbalance is to be in equilibrium.9. Over the past twelve months we have achieved a dramatic improve-ment in our balance of payments despite an unprecedented public sectordeficit only because personal saving has been uniquely high, businessinvestment has fallen and stocks have been run down.    It is likely that infuture private individuals will save less in order to maintain their living standards when their real take-home pay is falling.    Stocks will riseagain as the economy recovers.    An increase in investment must be one ofour major objectives as the best means of increasing employment and improving productivity.    In this case we shall need to reduce the public sector deficit substantially if we are to maintain the improvement in our balance of payments and avoid providing the financial basis for continuinginflation.
10.       All these arguments make it essential that we should not once again decide on levels of expenditure which nay appear grossly excessivein a few months time.    We cannot afford tc ignore the dangers reportedin the MTA paper.    Bitter experience has taught successive governments the folly of basing expenditure programmes on unrealistic assumptions about the development of the economy.    The penalties for over-optimismare politically and economically catastrophic.    The losses from being over-cautious, on the other hand, are less serious, and expenditure programmes can be corrected more easily.    In approaching the PESCexercise this year we should accept the need for reductions in the white paper 1978-79 programmes of at least  2 billion (at 1974 Survey prices)and preferably up to  3 billion, and consider priorities against this background.    It is important that we should take a firm decision now on 2 billion as the minimum reduction so that we can state this in the debate on the counter-inflation White Paper in the coming weeks.    Wecan then leave until the completion of the PESC exercise in september the decision whether to make reductions up to the full  3 billion.D W treasury Chambers10 July 1975
