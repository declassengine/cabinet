DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 89 COPY NO       8131 July 1975CABINETPUBLIC expenditure note by the Secretary of the Cabinet1. Two notes are being circulated today as additional background forthe discussion on 4 August of C(75) 82.    They are:i. A note by the Secretary of State for the Environment onthe size of the public sector and on the growth of non-industrial employment (C(75) 88).ii. A note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on therelationships between the public sector&apos;s use of resources,taxation, and the public sector borrowing requirement (C(75) 87).2.        I should perhaps explain that, although both the seven days&apos; noticefor which Ministers asked on public expenditure papers, and the normal48 hour deadline for the circulation of papers for the meeting on 4 Augusthave passed, I considered it would nevertheless be more helpful to ministers on this occasion to breach rather than to enforce the rules and to circulate the essentially factual material in these papers for their information.Signed   JOHN hunt cabinet Office31 July 1975
