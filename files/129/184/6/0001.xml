DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY-S government(75) 8115 July 1975CABINETREMUNERATION, CHARGES AND GRANTS bill note by the Chancellor of the exchequer. I attach, for the information of my colleagues, the latest draft ofthe Remuneration, Charges and Grants Bill, which will provide theGovernment with the additional powers in support of the pay limit set out inthe White Paper &quot;The Attack on Inflation11 (Cmnd 6151).    The Bill will bepublished tomorrow, Wednesday 16 July 1975,2. As I told Cabinet this morning the Bill as published will not includeclause 4 of the draft attached below.    This clause, which would give theMinisters power to override other legislation affecting pay, will instead beincluded in the Reserve Powers Bill foreshadowed in paragraph 26 of theWhite Paper, which would make it illegal for the employer to exceed the pay limit.    I am satisfied that practically all the situations in which the needfor such a power might have arisen can be handled effectively within a voluntary policy .   A specialpower may, however, be needed to prevent thepayment to judges and magistrates of the second stage of the salary increaseawarded following the most recent review by the Top Salaries Review Body,should it not prove possible to persuade them voluntarily to forgo this increase.    This is necessary in order to preserve the comparability oftreatment between judges and Permanent and Deputy Secretaries,D W treasury Chambers15 July 1975COPY NO82
