IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 85 COPY NO23 July 1975CABINETWHITE PAPER ON MENTAL ILLNESSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services, Social Services Committee considered on 10 June a draft White paper on services for the mentally ill in England.    In view of our current discussions with local authorities on the control of public expenditure I was asked to seek the reactions of the new Consultative Council on LocalGovernment Finance.2. When I attended a meeting of the Council on 8 July I was told thatthe economic realism expressed in the Foreword was helpful;  and (subjectto a few minor changes that I have now made) that it would be useful to publish soon a White Paper which brought together in one documentexisting policies on the whole range of services for our mentally ill.    Inview of this support I propose sending the White Paper for printing with aview to its publication in the early autumn;  and I attach a copy of the final text for the information of colleagues.B A department of Health and Social Security22 July 1975
FOREWORD1,    Mental illness is a major health problem, perhaps the major health problemof our time.   It is also a major social problem.   At least 26 million working daysare lost each year by people suffering from mental ill-health.   Some 5 million people each year consult their general practitioners about a mental health problem.Others seek the help of the social services because a pressing consequence oftheir psychological disturbance is a social, housing, or domestic crisis.   By far the great majority of these people are never referred beyond primary care to the specialist psychiatric services.   Many others survive spells of stress and emotionalill-health without any professional help.2.    But though only a small proportion of diagnosed mental illness is referred tothe specialist psychiatric services, this proportion represents some 600,000people each year.3.    It is wrong to think of these 600,000 more seriously ill people as being simplya mental hospital problem.   Indeed, there has for years been general recognition ofthe significance of the social and environmental aspects of mental, illness.   Yetalthough it is sixteen years since the Mental Health Act of 1959 gave legislativerecognition to the importance of community care, supportive facilities in a non-medical, non-hospital setting are still a comparative rarity.   In 1972/3  200m* was spent on hospital services for the mentally ill^ by comparison something under  10mwas spent on social services, of which  3- *tm* was on day and residential facilities.In March 197^ 31 local authorities had no residential accommodation for the mentally ill and 63 no day facilities.*t.    Specialist care is still mainly based in large, geographically isolated mental hospitals, nearly all dating from the last century and designed for custodial care.Their outward appearance is often forbidding.   Staffing levels are often less thanadequate.   The equivalent of 800 full time consultant psychiatrists share clinicalresponsibility for about 250,000 in-patients each year, over 1^ million out-patientattendances, and more than 2 million day patient attendances.   Their numbers aremoreover unevenly distributed through the country.   Nurses and other professionalstaff often have similarly daunting responsibilities,   Basic facilities and amenities are often lacking.   At the last count in 1973 more than 20,000 patientsdid not have full personal clothing of their own; a similar number did not have acupboard in which to hang their clothes.   Thirty-six hospitals accounting for nearly one-third of in-patients were below the minimum standard set by my Department for domestic staff0* At November 1973 prices.
5.    There have of course been some improvements and changes.   The Hospital advisory service in their Annual Report for 1973 noted that it was a pleasure to record theimprovement in many spheres of psychiatric care in the hospital service.   Outpatient and day patient services have expanded and the number of in-patients has fallen.6*    But these improvements are not getting at the core of the problem.   What wehare to do is to get to grips with shifting the emphasis to community care.   Theproblems are many.   Social services facilities - hostels, day centres, group homes -have to be built up from their present minimal levels.   Staff to run them have tobe recruited and trained, and the implications for trained and experienced social work staff have to be recognised and provided for.   Psychiatric services have tobe developed locally, in general and community hospitals and in health centres.The balance of resources between health and the personal social services has to beshifted.7.    We have to recognise moreover that the pace at which community based carecan be introduced depends not only on resources but on the pace of response of thecommunity itself.   That means nearly every one of us, for the likelihood is that each of us has a friend, relative or neighbour with a mental health problem.   Thereis much scope for greater public understanding of the nature of mental illness - inparticular for people to appreciate the extent to which modern methods of treatmentcan succeed in controlling the kind of disturbed behaviour which was associatedwith admission to a mental hospital 20 or more years ago.   But this is only onesi do of the problem.   In recent years community care has been urged - not only forthe mentally ill - but for a growing number of different groups of ill or disabledpeople.   All with good reason.   But the demands which these make in total upon thecoraunity must not be greater than the community can accept.8.   Even in favourable economic circumstances it would obviously take a long term programme to achieve in all parts of the country the kind of change we are advocating.Moreover in a time scale of this dimension advances in knowledge are themselvesbound to lead to changes in ideas about the desirable pattern of services.   Inpresent economic circumstances there is clearly little or no scope for substantial additional expenditure on health and personal social services, at least for theooxt few years.   What then are we to do?   Local services mean more day hospital treatment, more day care, more treatment and support in the home itself; and lessin-patient treatment.   Indeed the savings on expensive in-patient treatment shouldmean, taking health and social services together, little increase in total running costs.   But the savings and the expenditure are not always simultaneous, and the
CONFIDENTIALnot effectv overalls on running costs does not give a complete picture of the implications for different sectors of the health and personal social services.The policy can only be achieved if there is substantial capital investment in newfacilities and if there is a significant shift in the balance of services betweenhealth and local authorityv   In the present state of financial stringency we have therefore felt bound to ask ourselves whether we should issue the White Paper ateillo9*    It is clear that the scope for making progress during the next few years willbe very limitedu   Without increased community resources the numbers in mental hospitals cannot be expected to fall at the rate they might otherwise have done.Delay in building up local services must mean too that it is unlikely that we shallbe able to see in every part of the country the kind of service we would ideallylike within even a twenty-five year planning horison.   But equally we must face thefact that any programme for the improvement and development of so large a sector of the health and social services involves substantial investment and a long-term programme*   We believe moreover that in a period of severe financial restraint itin even more important that there should be a clear statement of policy objectives$gainst which priorities can be assessed.10o   We have therefore decided to proceed with publication of the White Paper, butera the basis that it is a long-term strategic document indicating the general direction in which we should move and the general background against which we shouldbe taking decisions?   I cannot overemphasise that this White Paper must not beregarded as setting out a specific programme: it is simply a statement of objectivesagainst which shorter term decisions can be made.   Very little material progress inthe shape of new physical development is to be expected in the next few years*Moreover the tiraescale for further significant progress must depend on the general economic situation and has therefore at present to be left open.   It will be forCentral Government after due consultation with health and local authorities/to planea a national basis the use of the funds available within the constraints of theeconomic situation for the health and personal social services as a whole; and forthe matching health and local authorities through joint planning and collaborationto make the most effective local use of the financial resources available tothem botho   We thus see the next three or four years as a time for health and localauthorities firstly to do whatever is possible within the very limited resources available - and there is much that can be done without necessarily using extra moneythrough changes of attitude and more effective use of resources: but also to lookahead and together, on the basis of the policies set out in this White Paper, toagree on what should be done when additional resources do become available.   Thiswill mean agreeing for example on which local services should be developed first andwhich will have to continue, at least for some years, to be based on existing mental hospitals.

CHAPTER 1THE NATURE OF THE problem the nature and classification of mental illnessMental illness and mental health1,1   Mental illness and conversely mental health is notoriously difficult to define.   There is now a deep interest in the psychological aspects of humanbehaviour, collectively as well as individually, an interest which is constantlyextending to new facets of everyday life in society.   There is growing recognitionof the relationship between behaviour and environment; and indeed there are probably few aspects of public and private activity that have not been held tohave some effect whether direct or indirect on our psychological well-being.At the individual level there is an increasing readiness to seek counselling,or other forms of professional psychiatric help over an ever wider range of personal psychological problems.   As our knowledge and awareness of the inter-relationship between physical, emotional, social and environmental factorsincreases so no doubt this process will continue; more people will seek help andthe boundary of what we collectively regard as mental ill health will be setfurther back.   Indeed we must recognise that the potential demand for psychiatric(1)help is virtually unlimited     .   We must ask ourselves to what extent such demandsare realistic: not only in terms of finance and manpower, for manpower constraints will inevitably impose their own limits, but also in as much as they represent unrealexpectations of what psychiatric help can do.1.2   Changes in the nature of the problems for which individuals consider they need psychiatric help imperceptibly change society&apos;s general concept of what ismental illness and what is not; how far behaviour can be regarded as escentricityand a reflection of individual personality; how far behaviour calls for punishmentand how far for treatment.   But we should beware of over emphasising this,particularly in the context of current psychiatric practice in this country.   Itis new advances in scientific knowledge and understanding that have enaD?fd^ornexample of the sufferings of the housebound phobic or the young girl starvingherself through anorexia nervosa for what they are - namely the manifestation of mental illnesses for which it is both humane and realistic to offer professional help.M  How de vie then define mental illness?   On the one hand &quot;mental illness asa term probably still has a certain stigma attached to it and most of usprobably draw our own fine dividing linB between the more comprehensibleand respectable forms of mental ill health and the more frightening or(1)- as long ago as 1966 a research study suggested the presence in all communitiessurveyed of a large sub-group of emotionally sick or emotionally disturbed patientsamounting to between 1/5 and 1/10 of the total population.
distressing forms which we privately label as mental illness. But on thiskind of definition the mentally ill would constitute only a small proportion-in practice mainly those with psychotic illoess-of the total numbers of those who are currently seeking and receiving help from general practitioners and psychiatrists for psychological problems of various kinds,from severe depression, and phobias, through a whole range of sexual,marital and other human relationship problems. Equally we have to acknowledgethat there are many problems of human behaviour- often causing great distress -fo   which psychiatry can offer little or no remedy and for which other formsof help and support may be more relevant. Attempted suicide is often a case in point. In recent years the numbers of attempted suicides have risen sharply.Research suggests that only a minority of those concerned suffer from psychiatricillness as such; but often there is a background of longstanding personalityand relationship difficulties.Is  mental illness increasing?1.4 The difficulties involved in measuring the prevalence of mental illness and inparticular in making comparisons between prevalence rates in different places andat different points in time will be immediately apparent.   The point has alreadybeen made both that to some extent society is constantly redefining its concept of mental ill-health, and that advances in scientific knowledge enable us tounderstand and treat mental suffering which, insofar as it was previously untreatablejwas in the past not regarded as illness.   These two processes go hand in hand.Surveys of prevalence based on the number of contacts made with relevant health and social services will only reflect the extent to which people in practice seekprofessional help for their psychiatric or psychological problems.   Conversely as and when new treatments are developed and facilities are both readily available and accessible they will themselves call forth new demands.   Morbidity surveysrun up against the difficulty that they are liable to reflect individual researchers&apos;concepts of mental illness.1.5  We are tending to widen our definition and our recognition of psychologicaldistress.   But is the underlying incidence of such distress also increasing?1Are we in fact living in a society which is positively giving rise to mental illhealth?   There is  no hard evidence to confirm that the incidence of mental illness is increasing but undoubtedly there are features of modern industrialsociety which many people feel make   them more vulnerable to mental stress:high rise flats for families with young children; production line work with no
CONFIDENTIALjob satisfaction: the break-up of the large family unit; overcrowded living conditions; the pressures of advertising with its suggestions of ^rms&apos; ofhappiness, friendship and sexual satisfaction and the consequent feelings ofinadequacy among those who have not achieved then.Estimates of prevalence1.6  The second National Morbidity Survey carried out in 1970-71 by the Officeof Population Censuses and Surveys surveyed 53 general practices serving some300,000 people, and found that on average over the year 1 in Ik males and 1 in 7females consulted their general practitioner for some form of mental illness.This would be equivalent to about 5 million people nationally.   However severalrecent surveys have suggested that general practitioners themselves may not always detect psychiatric symptoms - or recognise them as such - and there is little doubt that much mental illness, some of it serious, goes undiagnosed anduntreated.   True need is almost certainly much greater than present demand.The proportion of those who consult their general practitioner who are referredto the specialist services is about 12 per cent.   It has been estimatedthat about 600,000 people nationally receive specialist psychiatric serviceseach year.   This estimate is based on information from psychiatric case registerswhich have been established in some parts of England and Scotland and on whichall contacts  with specialist services from a given population are recorded.But numbers however great cannot measure the sum of human misery, the tragicwaste to the community of creative talents, drive and enthusiasm and the bitterdisruption of family life and relationships which mental illness often brings.Classification by diagnostic group.7 Over recent decades there has been much debate both within and between different professional groups about the nature and classification of mental illness.   The increased involvement of a widening range of professions -psychologists, social workers, sociologists, geneticists and biochemists hasled to the recognition of new dimensions of the problem and new theories.What is perhaps most encouraging and indeed impressive, given the enormousscope of the problem, is that in recent years widespread research has ledto a growing consensus of opinion among the different disciplines that mental illness is not the result of any single factor but is caused by a wide range* *  a. andor factors, social, familial,/genetic, and is similarly multi-faceted in itsmanifestation.   Classification is not easy: there is often overlap betweenacme of the generally accepted diagnostic groupings and the severity ofsymptoms for the same diagnosis varies from one individual to another.   Suchproblems are however found in all branches of medicine to varying degrees andare by no means confined to psychiatry.   Similarly, as in other fields, aclinical diagnosis by itself will often be of limited significance in determiningoertain of the patient&apos;s needs.   But in the field  of mental illness there canon occasion be a real danger in giving a patient a diagnostic label, particularly*hare CONFIDENTIAL
this is liable to follow him throughout his life and place him on the Wrong sideof the dividing line between public acceptance and understanding, and publicrejection and fear.1.8   Classification is however important.   It is the starting point for muchcomparative research, for investigating the causation of identified patterns of psychiatric disturbance, and it is through informed debate that furtherknowledge and understanding will be gained.   While therefore in the following paragraphs mental illness is desribed on the basis of the Mental Disorders sectionof the International Classification of Diseases, this is done in full recognitionof the limitations of any one approach.The Neuroses1.9  The principal distinction normally drawn is that between the psychoses andthe neuroses, the sufferer from neurotic illness retains his consciousness of thereal world about him but certain of his behaviour patterns become exaggerated byfears or depression to such an extent that they interfere with his normal dailylife.   People with neurotic conditions account probably for more than one thirdof all referrals to psychiatric services.   Depression and anxiety or tensionstates are perhaps the most common.   The OPCS survey found that during 1970/7120 men per 1000 and k6 women per 1000 attended general practice with a diagnosisof anxiety neurosis.   The corresponding figures for depressive neurosis were1^ and 46 per 1000,   Depression and anxiety states will vary greatly in degree,in some cases being no more than a relatively short lived response perhaps tobereavement or a new situation, in others severe and prolonged and with no obviousexternal cause.   It should be emphasised that the prevalence of these conditions is much greater than that of psychotic illness.The Psychoses1.10 To those around him, the sufferer from psychotic illness, as the conditionadvances, is distinguished by his tendency to lose contact with his surroundingsand his distorted view of the world around him.   The largest single group ofjpsychoses are those known as schizophrenia or the schizophrenias.   The onset ofschizophrenia, perhaps the most disabling of all forms of mental illness, occursgenerally in the teens to early adulthood with hospital admission rates beinghighest among the 25-j&amp; age group.   The prevalence rate for adults, in terms of numbers of people in contact with the specialist psychiatric services in any oneyear is approximately one in 300.   Schizophrenia is often accompanied by a withdrawal into a world of fantasy and auditory hallucinations.with disturbanceof volition or drive, and as it progresses there may be accompanying physicaldeterioration.   A variant may start with the onset of delusions of persecution.Another group of psychoses, known as affective psychoses, have been estimated as
having a comparable prevalence rate of about one in 280.   They tend to occurlater in life and are characterised by changes of mood that cannot be accountedfor by external causes alone.   The schizophrenias and the affective psychosesare together included in a group of mental illnesses known as the functionalpsychoses.   Though no single theory of causation has yet been established itis possible that they have an inherited biochemical basis, but are precipitatedby environmental factors.   There is a clearer understanding of the physicalbasis of a further group, known as the organic psychoses.   Acute confusions!states may be reversible depending on the associated physical condition.Dementia on the other hand, seen mainly in the elderly, is the result of the death of some brain cells and leads to intellectual deterioration and lack ofemotional control and drive.   It is an irreversible and generally progressiveprocess, the prevalence of which has been shown to increase greatly amongpersons in their late seventies and eighties.Psychopathic disorder1.11 The Mental Health Act 1959 defined psychopathic disorder as &apos;a persistentdisorder or disability of the mind (whether or not including subnormality of intelligence) which results in abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsibleconduct on the part of the patient and requires or is susceptible to medical treatment&apos;.   The term &apos;psychopath&apos; has come to carry considerable stigma andthere has been a reaction against it in favour of &quot;personality disorder withantisocial trends&apos; since this is thought to convey a better idea of the range of problems involved.   Personality disorders affect people of a wide intelligenceange, and seem to be inherent personality traits rather than illnesses as such.Those with personality disorders have in some cases an apparent lack of ordinaryappreciation for the feelings of others, and a common characteristic is aninability to learn by experience.   They are often considered as having animmaturity of personality which may manifest itself in many different ways:at one end of the spectrum.they may be highly disruptive members of society andcommit serious crimes.   At the other it may result in no more than an inability to organise a settled life, often with a consequent tragic descent down thesocial scale.   The individuals basic difficulty in coming to terms with society
/ Under the Chairmanship of Lord Butler6 CONFIDENTIALmay, however, manifest itself in many ways each in some way an attempt to resolvehis apparently insoluble problems.1.12 There is considerable uncertainty about the extent to which people withpersonality disorders can be helped by the mental health services and there is undoubtedly a need for further research and new approaches in this field.   Itis generally accepted that such people do not readily respond to traditionalpsychiatric treatment and indeed there are difficulties of principle in determiningthose cases in which it is proper to regard a behaviour pattern as a &quot;disorder1.Nonetheless in recent years there has been a sharp increase in the number ofadmissions to hospital for personality and behaviour disorders.  People with serious personality disorders not infrequently become involved with the Police.They also present considerable problems for social services departments.   There has recently been much debate as to whether andif so to what extent it is appropriate for them to be admitted compulsorily topsychiatric hospitals.   The present position is that the concept of susceptibilityto medical treatment is applied to compulsory admission; and this has led to difficulties in certain areas in the placement of psychopaths appearing beforethe Courts.   The question of psychopaths who offend against the law is currentlyI/)being studied by the Committee on Mentally Abnormal Offenders.Alcoholism and drug addiction1.13 Alcoholics and drug addicts can be seen as those whose repeated and excessiveuse or misuse of alcohol or drugs has led, whether singly or in combination, to social, psychological, or somatic harm including the development of dependence.Dependence may be physical and it may be psychological and has elements therefore,of both compulsion and habit.   A difference from the illnesses described above isthat the availability of the &quot;agent&quot;, be it alcohol or drugs, as well as social,cultural, personality and physical factors may have contributed to its growth.Alcoholism and drug dependence are not mental illnesses in themselves, though some mental illness may accompany them or arise as a consequence; the psychologicalcomponent in dependence is commonly treated by or under the general direction ofa psychiatrist.   No account of the psychiatric services would be complete without some account of the services needed by those who are dependent on alcohol or drugs,or who harm themselves by misusing them.Distinction between mental illness and mental handicap1.1^ Mental illness is quite distinct from mental handicap.   Mental handicapis usually determined before or during birth or in the early weeks of life andis characterised by intellectual retardation which affects the ability to learnand reason.   It may be accompanied by physical and psychiatric handicaps.Though the development of the mentally handicapped person can be improved bytraining, education and social care, mental handicap cannot be cured and is alife-long condition.   Mental illness however can occur at any age and affectspeople of every intellectual level.   (Some mentally handicapped people alsosuffer from mental illness.)   While in the present state of medical knowledgeby no means all forms of mental illness can be completely relieved, advances
The needs of the mentally ill1.1b  These clinical labels reveal relatively little about what it means to bementally ill or to live with someone who is so afflicted, or by implicationwhat the needs of the mentally ill are in terms of services.   In one sense itis misleading to attempt any generalised statement about the needs of the mentally ill.   The needs of any one mentally ill person are always different from another even though they may have the same diagnostic label*It 1b not merely that need depends on factors such as age, whether there is homesupport or a sympathetic employer, but rather that the manifestation of the illnessitself will to some extent be coloured by the personality and home environmentof the individual.   Viewed from the individual level, need is personal and it isimportant that those working with the patient should see his problems in this way.At the same time these individual perspectives should not mask the significanceeither of the clinical factors whose identification is fundamental to scientificclassification, or of those needs for certain kinds of help which the mentally illhave in common, which are discussed below, and which form the basis of any attempt at national or local planning of services for them.   We must aim therefore ata range of facilities which can be used by professional staff to provide for each individual the particular combination of care, treatment and support he needs at any point in time.1oTfc Not only does need vary qualitatively between different individuals, itvaries quantitively, especially in the length of time for which support and treatment may be required.   Much emphasis has been laid, and rightly, on therevolution which has taken place in the treatment of the mentally ill inrecent years.   This has meant that for many mentally ill people, psychiatrictreatment need mean no more than a spell of out-patient or day patient visitsor a very few weeks as an in-patient.   Nevertheless there will remain some people who, although their more acute symptoms can be relieved will need moreor less permanent medical, social and nursing support in a sheltered environment.While this group may be relatively few in number their needs must be recognised,especially as the implications in terms of resources are quite disproportionateto their numbers.   Another important group are those with mental illness symptomsrelated to old age.   Increasing longevity is bringing its own problems in thisrespect.Prevention&quot;1*1&quot;? In the absenceof more precise knowledge primary prevention can only be considered in therather broad terms of reducing the exposure of individuals to those circumstancesover the last 20 years mean that most functional mental illnesses will now respond to treatment.
and conditions which are likely to place their mental health at risk.   Healthyphysical, mental and emotional development in childhood is obviously particularly important.   Reference has been made already to the wide range of social and environmental conditions which may increase vulnerability to mental illness.The precise weight to be attached to them can rarely be established: poverty,unemployment, lack of job satisfaction and poor working conditions, bad housing,are themselves often a cause of marital stress and breakdown in family life.For some of these central and local authority has a responsibility: but it wouldbe wrong to pretend that we are anywhere near being able to draw up a positiveplan for a society conducive to mental health.1.10 Nevertheless we can take some steps to put right some of the clearlyunsatisfactory aspects of our social environment.   In the field of employment for example the Employment Medical Advisory Service of the Health and SafetyExecutive has created a senior appointment in mental health to examine theproblems of stress in modern industrial life and offer advice to industry andthe unions.   It is anticipated that a small team of specialists will beavailable to undertake surveys and studies, and arrange for appropriate research work with outside bodies such as the Medical Research Council.   In this area,the Employment Medical Advisory Service will co-operate closely with the WorkResearch Unit of the Department of Employment, set up in 197^ to assistorganisations in taking practical steps towards increasing the quality ofworking life by improving the design of jobs and organisation of work.   Similarlyin its approach to housing problems the Government has taken steps notablythrough the Housing Act 197^, to ensure that resources are concentrated on theareas of greatest stress.1.19  Employers, managers, environmental planners all need to bear in mind the potential impact of their decisions on people*s mental well-being.The lessons of high rise flats are an illustration; and it is to be hoped that local housing authorities in particular will increasingly take into account thequestion of mental health when considering the effect of new developments on existing communities.   Rarely will there be easy answers, but it is a dimensionof planning which should be acknowledged.
1,2CThe growth of a wide variety of community development and self help schemes.clubs and societies is particularly encouraging.   Such organisations can provide a whole range of sources of help which though perhaps not specificallydirected at mental health have an important part to play in providing those at risk with additional psychological or social resources.   Marriage guidance,vocational guidance, clubs and recreational facilities, church and voluntary organisations, education for leisure and retirement, are all relevant.Organisations and services which are specifically aimed to help in particularcrises such as marital breakdown, pregnancy, bereavement, retirement orredundancy are of special importance. Collectively and individually we each havea responsibility to be sensitive to the emotional and psychological needs of*n  -j . . . those who are vulnerable.aarly recognition1.21   The individual himself may be unaware of his condition. Those around him and even professional staff may not recognise it initially. Mental illnessmay often be hidden beneath a wide variety of presenting problems: anostensibly physical complaint, marital and family problems, quarrels withneighbours, accident proneness at work and delinquency may all have theirroots in mental illness. Moreover somtimes the person for whom help is apparentlysought may not be the only one in need of professional support: the parents, forexample, of a disturbed child may themselves require psychiatric help.Services must be organised and professional staff trained to recognise the early stages of psychiatric disturbance and to arrange referral to the appropriateservices. Early intervention may often serve to prevent the sondition deterioratingto the point at which a severe crisis occurs and hospital admission becomes theonly possible solution.Assessment1.22       Assessment of needs must take account of theeffects of mental illness on almost every aspect of a person&apos;s life.   It shouldbe a continuing process involving all the professions concerned, aimed atreducing as swiftly as possible the damaging effects of illness.   The importanceof multiprofessional assessment lies not least in the interchange of viewsbetween assessors.   Not only is this essential in the development of an accurate,broad based assessment but the assessment by each individual discipline is often influenced by those of others.Clinical Treatment1.23 General practitioners working with other primary care staff at presentundertake the medical treatment of nearly 90$ of diagnosed mental illness and
it seems unlikely that this pattern of care will change significantly.It is. however, iaportant that those people who need specialist treatmentare accurately identified and promptly referred to specialist services.Equally, it is important that specialist help should be readily availableto the primary care teams.1.24     For those who require specialist medical and nursing care and treatment facilities need to be available locally;   and theseneed to be designed to enable both physical and psychological forms oftreatment to be practised.  A local service means that patients can easily attend as day or out-patients and professional staff can be onthe spot to help patients and their families.    In some cases admission to hospital as an in-patient will be necessary, either because theillness warrants 24 hour medical and nursing supervision for a time or becausethe home circumstances are so intimately connected with the illness that a move from the home is an essential step for objective assessment.   In general, however 0.the need for inpatient treatment is declining.   So also is the need for treatment to be given under conditions of physical security.   Contrary to general publicbelief, the most serious forms of mental illness are rarely associated withaggression although they may give rise on occasion - and for short periods - tobehaviour which is distressing and perhaps frightening to the layman.   nevertheless it is important that the need for treatment tinder secure conditions, although for a relatively small number of patients, should be recognised and provision made sccozdiigtySocial rehabilitation25 Mental illness often fundamentally affects social adjustment,even after the primary symptoms of the illness have been treated.The sufferer may lack his former energy and drive; and have difficulty in makingor resuming personal friendships or family relationships.   He may have lost thepower of sustained concentration; and the ability to organise even relativelysimple daily routines may have to be relearnt.   If he is to resume his placein a busy competitive society he will need help in regaining social skillswhich in the ordinary fit person are taken for granted.   The loss of suchskills even for a short period of time may have far-reaching repercussions.A person recovering from mental illness may well not be able to bear the full
responsibility of organising his life.1,2&apos;b Social rehabilitation has also to be considered from the standpoint ofthe community in the wider sense.The pace of development of community services for the mentally ill is dependentpartly on changes in attitude by the community.It is also dependent on the community&apos;s capacity to adjust to the implications of community care for other groups - for example, the mentally handicapped, the physically handicapped, the elderly mentally infirm.   We must ensure that the community is not itself overwhelmed.Help for the family1.27 Living with people who have had or who are recovering from mental illnesscan place heavy strains on a family.The mentally ill donot always fit easily into the family circle or adapt to the family routine:meal times, social activities, entertaining may be disrupted and the familycan rapidly become socially isolated.   If the mother iB ill, the father may find himself having to take time off work and the family income may fall.Special arrangements may need to be made for the care of the children.   Researchstudies have already shown that the children of mentally ill parents are themselves more likely to suffer from mental illness.   The family may becomeafraid to leave a withdrawn and uncommunicative member alone; and they too may become virtually housebound, often giving up sources of income and interest.Under such stresses the family may become torn between their determination notto reject the individual member, and a desperate need for relief and support.Feelings of guilt may be accentuated where there are brothers or sisters livingat home, competing for their parents  attention and resentful of the way inwhich their own lives and friendships are disrupted.1,2? - S^me families    &quot;&quot;V De able &quot; and indeed wish - to under-take the demanding task of care.   But in these cases it is essential that they receive adoquate support and advice from professional staff and that services should be organised to give them effective relief: to enable them to go on holiday and to cope with more urgent domestic crises which may make continuedcare impractical from time to time, Or simply to allow them some respite fromthe sheer physical and emotional strain.
Accommodation1.Jc? For some families this strain may prove quite intolerable.   In other cases, although the family is willing, it may be that - at any rate for a time -taking his place again within the family will constitute too severe an emotionaland psychological strain on the individual himself.   Sometimes, moreover the patient has no home to return to.   An important requirement   must therefore beto provide alternative arrangements so that a person who is or has been mentally ill can have the equivalent of a secure home and the company of others.   Thesupport of professional staff may be needed where he is able to cope with onlya limited number of the complexities of daily life.   Without such support hemay neglect himself, become isolated and withdrawn, and his mental and physicalhealth may deteriorate.employment*30 Mental illness sometimes results in an impairment of an individualsability to occupy himself in a constructive way and in the more formal senseto pursue his normal employment.   He may be unable to keep regular hours, todeal with colleagues or staff, or to keep up an adequate output under pressure.Many people can redevelop their capacity for work but they will need training facilities and help in finding employers sympathetic to their needs.   during their illness they will need help and encouragement so that the rhythm and discipline of working, and the ability to occupy leisure time are not lost.Those who are left with a residual disability making them unable to return totheir former field of employment need to be given the opportunity to learn newskills suited to their new situation.Flexibility and co-operation.3&apos;   The above paragraphs have referred briefly and in general terms to j/oifio**&apos;-* rtetLater Chapters desciibe the services which are envisaged to meet them.They involve manyprofessional disciplines and a number of different statutory authorities^   Theindividual client or patient and his family cannot however be expected,particularly at times of severe psychological strain, to analyse the complexity of pressing clinical, financial, domestic, housing or employment problems intowatertight compartments relating to different authorities.   The hallmark of agood service for the mentally ill is a high degree of local co-ordination.   Theorganisation of services in the future must be sufficiently flexible to enable
them to identify and respond to widely varying individual needs for care and support, yet with areas of responsibility, and lines of communicationsufficiently clearcut to enable action to be taken quickly and effectively.It is particularly important that patients should be able to move easilybetween different parts of the service - from hospital  to residential and daycare - and if necessary back to hospital again.   At all times, the individual and his family should feel that they are dealing with a single integrated service.1.32 The Individual and his family must also be made to feel that they themselves have a positive contribution to make to the whole process of treatment, care and rehabilitation.   They should be encouraged wherever possible to discuss with the professional staff involved the various needs and the way in which these mightbe met.   The patient8a family is often anxious and willing to help and should begiven every opportunity and encouragement to do so.
CHAPTER 2DEVELOPMENTS IN SERVICES FOR THE MENTALLY ILLServices upto 1961The Victorian Inheritance2.1     The facilities we have at present to serve the mentally ill are largelyan inheritance bequeathed to us by the Victorians.   Of the 100 or so hospitalsproviding treatment solely for the mentally ill now in existence, most were built in the nineteenth century and some have an even longer history.   Most arevery large - a number were built to accommodate 2,000 or more patients; and were deliberately built in areas which were then, and in many cases still are, isolated and remote from centres of population.   The aim was twofold; partly to protect society by providing custodial care behind lockeddoors and high walls and partly to protect the patient by providing him with a secure shelter.   A remote site in the country was therefore desirable on bothcounts, and had the added advantage that it enabled many patients to have thebenefit of wholesome work in the open air.In an era whichlacked modern medicine, had but the most rudimentary welfare services and no    ,system of social security payments, the large mental hospital was designed tobe as far as possible a self-sufficient community meeting the patient&apos;s needat once for care and custody.The Drugs Revolution of the 1950s2&apos;X     From the time these hospitals were built and right up to the year 1954,the number of resident patients in mental illness hospitals went on steadily increasing save for a small temporary reduction during each of the two WorldWars.   No new mental illness hospitals were however built after the 1930s andby the early 1950s many were becoming severely overcrowded.    Serious thoughtwas then being given to the need to build new mental hospitals; but fortunatelythe first half of the 1950s saw major developments in drug treatment, inparticular with the drug group known as the phenothiazines.   The particularsignificance of these drugs lay in the fact that they enabled doctors to control the - disturbed behaviour of the psychotic patient.As a result not only was the need for locked doors greatly reduced; but it wasalso possible for doctors and nurses to
develop contact with patients who had hitherto been almost entirely cut off fromthe real world around them by their psychotic illness.    These drugs did not cureillness: but they did enable symptoms to be controlled and relieved and hencemade it possible to prevent or at least reduce to a considerable extent thesocial and personal deterioration accompanying prolonged psychotic illness.The discovery ofthe phenothiazines, and more recently the long acting derivatives.was important but one should not underestimate the significance of other developments:    changes in staff attitudes; the introductionof non-physical approaches to treatment&apos;, the development of social security andother forms of support outside hospital.    Together these developments led to what has been called the &quot;open-door&quot; policy.   The function of the hospital was seenincreasingly as being for treatment and rehabilitation rather than care andcontrol.    With the growing realisation that so many patients could be treated asday patients or out-patients, admission for long term in-patient treatment becameless necessary.    This changing approach also led to the development of smallpsychiatric units in general hospitals for treating some mentally ill peoplelocally, instead of at large   distant specialist hospitals.The Royal Commission of 1957 and the Mental Health Act 19592.3    The Royal Commission on the Law Relating to Mental Illness and mental deficiency, and its legislative sequel, the Mental Health Act 1959 gave formal recognition to the fundamental change in approach which was taking place.    TheAct made far reaching changes in the procedures for admission to a mental hospital:for the great majority of patients, admission for psychiatric treatment nowentailed no more formality than admission for any other form of hospital treatment.This emphasised the hospital&apos;s role as a place for treatment and not merely custody.Directions under the National Health Service Act   placed new duties on what were then the health departments of local authorities to provide for the care and after-care of mentally ill people outside hospital.
Projections of Declining Numbers of In&apos;PatientsBy  the end of the 1950s the repercussions of the new forms of treatment were beingdramatically reflectea^in^ei numbers.   From 3.4 per 1,000 population in 1954,the number of occupied beds had already fallen to 3.1 per 1,000 bv 1960.Projections made in 19&amp;L* by Statisticians at the General Register Office suggestedthat in the future some o,9 beds per 1,000 population would be needed for patientsStaying less than 2 years;and that a further 0.9 would be required for newly arising longer stay patients,The projections further suggested that none of the patients then in hospital would still be there in 15 years or so.   The.1962 Hospital Plan/ recognised the placeof the short-stay psychiatric unit as a part of the general hospital and envisaged that many of the existing mental hospitals would have no place in the new pattern of service.The Underlying movement to community care2.5    The underlying movement was becoming clearly discernible, namely of bringing into closer relationship services for the mentally ill whether in hospital or outside it, with services for other forms of illness and handicap.   Psychiatry was* Lancet, 1st April 1961, p.710/ Hospital Plan for England and Wales, 1962, Cmnd 1604.
coming in out of the cold.   The report of the Royal Commission commented:&quot;The mental health services would lose much more than they could gain by a returnto isolation and separation, and it would be most unfortunate if schemes forco-ordination between hospitals and local authorities were not to be accompaniedby correspondingly close contact with other parts of their own services.&quot;How far have expectations been fulfilled?2.fc     It is now some 15 years since this watershed.    How far have hopes beenfulfilled: how far frustrated and disappointed?   The process of integrating  :psychiatric with general hospital and community services has gathered strength.There are now a considerable number of general hospital psychiatric units -   .\.although varying considerably in size and adequacy of accommodation.    There is greater emphasis in undergraduate medical education on psychiatric illness.Only one of the provincial medical schools lacks an Academic Department ofPsychiatry.    There are however still no such Departments at four of the Londonmedical schools.    Social work support and services for the mentally ill are now an integral part of the responsibility of local authority social services departments.The process has not always been smooth.   The case, for example, for the integratedsocial services department was hotly debated..   Both in the medical and social workfields those concerned with the mental illness services still face the very realdilemma of wanting the benefits of integration, yet wishing to retain the differentapproach to therapy that mental as distinct.from physical illness so often requiresof wanting to be an integral part of the general pattern of health and social service facilities, but yet wishing to ensure that the special additional needsof the mentally ill are recognised and provided for.Physical and non-physical methods of treatment2.7    Drug treatments continue to be widely used, and have played a major part in facilitating the decline in length of in-patient stay for many patients, and the rapid growth of day and out-patient treatment.    It has to be recognised however,:that research has still not shown the precise mechanism by which these drugs have- particularly in the treatment or neurotic illnesstheir effect.   Some argue that drugs are used too much/; that they, treat symptomsonly and ignore underlying social, psychological and environmental causes of mental illness, for which psychological methods are more appropriate.    In particular somestress the importance of family and personal relationships as a factor in causingmental illness and argue that treatment must take account of this.    Thereare those who argue that often it is society or the family which is disturbedrather than the individual patient.   Others are equally convinced of the importance
of biochemical factors in causation and argue that from this viewpoint drugtreatment is the logical remedy.    The issues are widely discussed and debated;but what seems beyond doubt is that mental illness is a highly complex phenomenon,taking many forms and caused by a variety of different factors.    In recognitionof this, the great majority of psychiatrists deliberately adopt an eclectic approach to treatment.    While the choice of treatment is a matter for professionaljudgement, the patient and his family have to find the choice acceptable.    Althoughwhat doctors say to individual patients about   their illness must be a matter forclinical discretion, there would seem to be much to be said, as a matter ofprinciple, for accepting the need to explain to the patient and his family thenature of the illnessand the doctor&apos;s particular approach to its treatment.The &quot;open door&quot; policy . 8In one sense there has been very considerable progress towards community basedservices, in that the great majority of psychiatric hospitals and unitsincreasingly see themselves as serving a population that extends far beyond thehospital walls.    Out-patient attendances number lj million a year, day patientattendances 2 million.    Psychiatric nurses are working more and more with patients and their families in their own homes.    But by and large the non-hospitalcommunity resources are still minimal, though where facilities have been developedthey have in general proved successful.    The failure, for which centralgovernment as much as local government is responsible, to develop anything approaching adequate social services is perhaps the greatest disappointment ofthe last 15 years.   As a result the balance of existing facilities ^ health and social services - bears increasingly less relation to acknowledged needs.Hospital staff have, rightly in one sense, come to see their role as an activetherapeutic one and the hospital as a place for providing medical treatment and nursing care.    So they have become increasingly unwilling to act as social carecustodians for those who would not need to remain in hospital were supportingfacilities available in the community.    But we have to face the fact that adequate supporting facilities in the community are not generally available.   Formany years this will pose a continuing problem to which there is no easy answerand it places on the staff of t;he mental hospitals very real  frustrations.Much of their effort   in the past has been directed to developing
intensive treatment and rehabilitation leading to discharge back to the community.Largely as a result the gross overcrowding of earlier years has in general been considerably reduced.    Naturally they wish to see further progress in this direction.Clearly people should not be admitted to hospital who have no need for treatment;but admission and discharge policies must be realistic and take account of thelocal availability of supporting social services.    If they do not, they put at risk the whole principle of community care in the eyes of the public.    TheGovernment for its part intends to see that over the years the balance of health and social services is put right.2.^    The frustrations and dilemmas of this situation have been felt no less bythe great majority of local authorities who have been anxious to develop their services for the mentally ill, but who have been constrained by the limits on resources and the increasing and competing demands for new developments throughoutthe whole social services field.2.10  The term &quot;open-door hospital&quot; has, like &quot;community care&quot; become with timesomething of a catchphrase.    Such phrases tend to acquire an oversimplifiedmeaning and it may be worth examining what this concept means in terms of present day psychiatry.    It should clearly be regarded as signifying an approach totreatment rather than a factual description of the physical arrangements at thehospital.   Wards may be unlocked butprofessional judgement needs to be exercised as to whether a particular patientat a particular time should not be sufficiently supervised at least to preventhis leaving the hospital and abandoning his treatment.   The extent to whichphysical security is needed is a separate issue discussed in Chapter 5, hutadequate supervision of the relatively few patients who require itf isimportant for public trust and confidence in the overall pattern of care.
New dilemmas for some patients&quot;Difficult&apos; patients2.15 The emphasis on &quot;open door&quot; and active treatment and rehabilitation has brought inestimable benefit for the vast majority of patients0-.The question must however be asked whether these developments which have so benefited the great majority, have not produced new dilemmas inrelation to the care and treatment of certain minority groups and led forexample to a polarisation between the &apos;open&apos; system on the one hand and the&apos;security&apos; system on the other. ^ : Inrecent yearl/^some6psychiatrists - and nursing staff - have become increasinglyreluctant to accept in &quot;open door&quot; hospitals or units patients with difficultbehaviour problems.     Such reluctance moreover extends not only to patients whosebehaviour is continuously difficult, but sometimes also to patients who exhibitonly occasional minor violence.   Ihe reasons for this reluctance are complex.  Insome cases staff shortages may genuinely make it impossible to manage frequent^violent patientj   whereas in the ease of the persistentlydifficult patient requiring continuing physical security  the problem may be oneof providing security for a very small number of patients in circumstances inwhich it is not required for the majority.there2.11   In other cases f   may be * reluctance to admit as a patient someone who notonly disrupts the treatment of others but for whom the professional staff may have little to offer in terms of treatment.   Often such patients have a long historyof repeated admissions to mental hospitals; often they discharge themselves afteronly a day or so in hospital, perhaps only to end up in court or as vagrants, or after a varying interval to return themselves to hospital.   One can understand the wish not to admit to hospital a person whom the staff have repeatedly tried tohelp without apparent success.   But the public understandably become concernedwhen people who are clearly inadequate or behaviourally disturbed are refused admission to hospital and end up for example in prison.   The Government has greatsympathy with this concern^ and believes that until the right supporting social services can be developed the health and social services must accept a joint
responsibility for the care of these people and offer such,help as they can.It should perhaps be emphasised that repeated admissions should not necessarily be regarded as indicating failure on the part of the health and social services.Although in some cases it may well be true that inadequate treatment orfollow-up results in relapse and the &quot;&apos;open door&quot; beomes a &quot;revolving door&quot; thereare people whose needs are best met by a series of relatively brief admissionsaimed at managing particular episodes of disturbance.2.15   What is required is a service which is flexible and capable of dealing at local level wherever possible, with the difficult behaviour and violence whichmay occur from time to time during the treatment of particular patients.   the aim should be to keep the use of special &quot;security&quot; provision to the very small minority of patients who cannot otherwise be safely catered for.    It is necessaryboth to bear in mind the interests of the ;surrounding community and the need toprevent unnecessary restrictions on. individual liberty.   What is required is a range of provision, from the informal and open to the formal security units and special hospitals.Those with chronic illness&apos;2.14-&apos; The numbers of difficult and violent patients are relatively quite small.A more substantial minority group are those with chronic psychiatric illness^suchas some forms of schizophrenia, who require long-term treatment, care and support.Those who require continuing care, though not necessarily medical or nursingcare are particularly vulnerable to the present virtual total absence of long-stay sheltered accommodation in the community.    Moreover, thosewho do need very long-term medical and nursing care need a differentenvironment and a rather different paoe and tempo from those staying forshorter periods.    Muoh effort was put into the rehabilitation of thelong-stay patient in the 1950s and 60s.    Unfortunately, there was in practicerarely any possibility of discharge to the community, and this,,combined with the growing demands and interests of acute psychiatry have sadly tended to diminishinterest in this field - requiring as it does infinite patience, perseveranceand generous staffing.   We need to revive the interest in meeting the needs of
long-stay patients in a way which is challenging and satisfying for both staff and patients, and which integrates such care with that of the shorter staypatients, instead of regarding it almost as a separate and, often second-tierservice.Projected and present bed numbers2.l5  It maybe useful to assess the 1961 projections in the light of experience.The number of beds used for patients staying up to 2 years is now close to theprojection of 0.9 beds per 1000 population and the number of beds for longer staypatients who have been admitted since 1961 is also close to the projection forthat group.   The main difference between the projections and what has actuallyhappened is that a substantial number of the long stay patients who were in hospital in 1954, the data base used for the 1961 projectious, are still there.In 1971 some 30,000 of the original 110,000 were still in hospital and these numbers are only slowly declining.   Almost a half were still less than 65 years old.Working of theThe/Mental Health Act, 1959Mental Health2.lfe   It is generally accepted that the balance which the/Act struck between the liberty of the individual and the needs of patients and of the public for protection has proved to have been well judged.   There have been criticisms fromopposing directions, on the one hand that it has become too easy for patients toleave hospital and on the other hand that the powers of detention are still tooextensive, but such criticisms have been few and in general the Act has been well received.   Developments in care and changes in public attitude since 1959 havenot been such as to suggest that there is any need for a major reappraisal of thelaw of the kind that was undertaken by the Royal Commission.   We do however need
to look critically at the detailed working of the Act.   The Committee on MentallyAbnormal Offenders &apos; . ... ... has been reviewing theprovisions relating to offenders and its report is expected shortly.    In regardto those parts of the Mental Health Act which are outside the remit of theButler Committee the Department of Health and Social Security hopes to issuelater in the year a consultative document setting but provisional conclusions ofthe extent to which amendment to the 1959 Act is called for.    This document willbe available for consultation and comment at or as soon as possible after thepublication of the Butler Committee Report and on the basis of these consultationsGovernment will frame its legislative proposals.General Policy for the futureValidity of the concept of community care2.t?   Before therefore we make substantial new investment in services for the mentally ill, we are bound to ask whether the failures and problems ofthe last 20 years render invalid the concept of community orientated care and treatment..   We believe that the failures and problems are at the margins andthat the basic concept remains valid.    We believe that the philosophy of integration rather than isolation which has been the underlying theme ofdevelopment still holds good; and that for the future the  main aims must continue to be the development of much more locally based services, and a shiftin the balance between hospital and social services care.    We believe moreoverthat there is a very substantial measure of professional support for the objectives.   At the same time we must face up to the problems involved and theneed, to find -satisfactory solutions to them.
The dangers and problems involved2.18.  There is the danger firstly that psychiatric units in general hospitalsmay tend to be too selective about the patients they admit and that this couldexacerbate the problems of care for the minority groups, problems alreadyapparent within existing services.    It points up the inherent contrast betweenthe concept of providing a wide range of services on a single site, capable ofresponding to different and changing individual needs for treatment and care,but necessarily, because of this range, taking the form of a large and somewhatremote institution; and the concept of providing a network of smaller but local services acting as an integrated whole.   The mental hospitals by virtue of their size have been able to offer a range of facilities on a single site and have somestaff always available.   The price to be paid is in terms of isolation of staff and patients alike. &apos;:;2.19   The second danger is that of local isolation.  The mere fact that a service is local does not of itself make it a service integrated with the community.Integration is not simply a matter of geographical looation.   A hostel in the heart of suburbia can be inward-looking and institutionalised if it does notfunction as part of a wider service, and if it does not have staff with appropriatetraining.2.20 Thirdly a strategy for the development of local services andthe future of the large mental hospitals must inevitably be a long-termone and obviously has to have regard to the availability of resources0Uncertainty about the future has already hung over these hospitals sincethe 1962 Hospital Plan-        While the need for long-term objectives has to berecognised,     this factor of uncertainty emphasises the importance of providingrealistic plans for the shorter and medium term which will identify whichhospitals are likely to be phased out relatively quickly, which will have a reducedrole, and which will have a continuing major role in the longer term.the prospects of securing2.2/  Fourthly our planning must take into account/the growing weight ofexpenditure that will be necessary on the part of the local authorities if ve areto have any realistic hope of achieving the necessary shift towards the relevantcommunity services.
A Co-ordinated strategy2.22. The following Chapters set out the Governments     broad policy objectives.The first is an expansion of local authority personal social services to provide residential,domiciliary, day care and social work support.   The second is the relocation ofthe specialist services in local settings.   The third is the establishment ofthe right organisational links:   between area social work teams and the social work staff in day centres and residential care, and between the multi-professionaltherapeutic teams and the primary care services;   between the health serviceand local authority social services administrators and planners;   betweenprofessional and lay people.   The fourth is a significant improvement in staffingto enable individual patient needs to be assessed and reviewed on a multi-professional basis and to provide for earlier intervention and preventive work.A co-ordinated strategy meeting all four objectives should minimise the risks offragmentation and selectivity.   The way and rate at which these objectives, andparticularly the first three, are achieved will vary from area to area.j 2* &quot; - There are no easy solutions.The Government hopes that this White Paper will both give the necessary impetusto the general development of community orientated services and at the same timeprovide a basis for further discussion, experiment and research in the problemareas.Community involvement2.24 The statutory services, no matter how comprehensively they are planned, cannotby themselves provide a complete answer to the needs of mentally ill people.   Thegeneral aim of enabling the mentally ill to participate as fully as possible in the life of the community will only be achieved if other members of the communityrecognise and support it.
Public attitudes2.2$ Popular fears of mental illness have deep roots and the spread of greatertolerance and understanding can only be a gradual process.    There has neverthelessbeen a steady increase in awareness that mental illnesses are illnesses, that people recover from them and that the process of recovery is influenced by thelevel of help and understanding shown to the mentally ill by those around them.This development undoubtedly owes much to the way in which the role of the health and social services has itself evolved in recent years, with more and more people returning to ordinary life after a relatively short period of psychiatrictreatment.    The relationship between the mentally ill and the rest of societycannot however be taken for granted, as something which will sort itself out inthe wake of further improvements in statutory services.   A humane service forthe mentally ill requires the active concern of ordinary people as well as theirtolerance.   The success of rehabilitation depends in part on relationships with a wide range of private and public agencies-employers,housing and other local authority services and social security and other centralgovernment offices.    The people who work in such agencies are themselves ordinarymembers of the public and their capacity for sympathy and understanding is inevitably a reflection of the way in which mental illness is perceived by thecommunity at large.2.2&apos;    Whether much can usefully be done to influence public attitudes directlyis uncertain.   There is however a great deal which health and social servicesauthorities can do to encourage people who are actively concerned about theproblems of the mentally ill and want to give help themselves.This is discussed further in Chapter 3.The responsibility to the community2.27 Those who work in the health and social services fields have to recognisethat families and relatives, and indeed the public at large cannot be expeoted to
tolerate under the name of community care the discharge of chronic patientswithout adequate arrangements being made for after-care and who perhaps spendtheir days wandering the streets or become an unbearable burden on the lives of their relatives; hostels which are so selective that they are only halffull while people needing residential care are told they are unsuitable;appeals which go unanswered for help in crisis while authorities or professionalofficers debate boundaries of responsibility.    Such situations do not occurvery frequently: but where they do, the whole concept of community care is placed at risk.    The development of community orientated services depends on a two wayresponsibility: on the community as a whole to educate itself about mental illness^to extend its sympathy from the minor psychological problem to the more severeillness; and on all those concerned with the care and treatment of the mentally ill not to attempt to implement policies that depend on community tolerance faster than the community can adjust to them.   The care that is taken with the relatively few, and more difficult patients, is the guarantee of acceptance forthe majority.
CHAPTER 3TEAM WORK IN THE NEW PATTERN OF services .1   A number of different elements make up the comprehensive network of services envisaged in the new pattern.It is however the building up of teamwork and close relationships betweenprofessional staffs and lay groups that turns facilities into a working and comprehensive network of services.The primary care team3.2   The general practitioner&apos;s role both in treatment and in secondaryprevention of psychological disturbance is already      expanding,- although a number of agencies may be involved in bringing mental illness to notice - inparticular the employment medical advisory service and in the case of young people, the school psychological service - it is to the general practitionerthat the sufferer or his family are still likely to come for help.The general practitioner moreover will not always have to rely solely on hisown personal knowledge of the family to help him to identify underlyingpsychological problems of which the patient himself is perhaps unaware.   Hewill increasingly have the pooled knowledge of the members of? , The health visitor and home nurse both bavespecial responsibilities, for example   for to the elderly, and in thecourse of their domiciliary visits may detect signs of confusion or self-neglectsuggesting the onset of mental illness.   The health visitor through her regularlinks with families with young children is able both to see a child&apos;s behaviourat home among the family and hence to give early warning of a possible needfor psychological help for the child and also to be alert to signs of emotionaldisturbance or mental illness in other members of the family.
A social worker attached to a primary health care team is well placed to contribute to the identification of social and psychological problems and the assessment, diagnosis and rehabilitation of the patient;   and alsoto act as a link with the resources the community can offer.With their combination of professional skills and first hand experience ofthe individual, the home and the family, the primary care team can do much toensure early recognition and referral for specialist treatment.With the changing pattern of services many more mentally ill people will infuture be living in the community, perhaps attending hospital on an out or daypatient basis or between spells of in-patient treatment.   The primary care teamhave an important collective contribution to make to the care of such patients,not only by playing an appropriate part in treatment, but by keeping in close touch with patients who are prone to relapse, by helping their families tounderstand the nature of the illness, and by alerting the specialist servicesif the patient &apos;s condition or the family situation shows signs of deterioration.If they are to fulfil this role it is essential that they have the advice and support of the specialist team.The specialist therapeutic teamA multi-professional approach3.5    Multi-professional team work is of the utmost importance;   and this hasled to the concept of the specialist therapeutio team.   A specialisttherapeutic team would for example include psychiatrists, nurses, social workers^,therapists involved in occupational and recreational activities, and psychologists.3*6 &quot;The consultant psychiatrist- 8 normally has responsibility for ensuring that the needs and progress of eachpatient are regularly reviewed and that other members of the team are involvedin these reviews.   At the same time each individual member has responsibility in his own particular sphere for assessing progress and bringing to the notice/see further paragraphs 3.8-3.10 below.*see further paragraph 3*27 below.
of others in the teaa any developments which seem to call for a wider multi-professional review.   This is not to say, of course, that every member of thetherapeutic team will need to be involved with every patient, or indeed that every patient either needs - or would be willing to accept - a team approach to what he may feel are intensely private problems.It is howeverimportant that staff should recognise the potential value of multiprofessionalworking and be ready and willing to adopt this approach wherever it is in the patient&apos;s best interests.   The roles of the individual members of the team, inparticular the consultant psychiatrist who has clinical responsibility for treatmentare discussed more fully in Chapter 9*   These roles often overlap:   in somesituations personal skills may be more important than professional background.Relationship with primary care team3.8  The members of the specialist team need to be readily available for advice and consultation to colleagues in other disciplines who may have patients withpsychological problems.   Such relationships are of course long established &apos;between consultants and general practitioners though here too there is scope forimportance of psychiatric advicefurther development as manpower resources permit.   The  /for patients under the care of consultants in general medical and surgical wards is becoming increasinglyrecognised.   A physical illness may well complicate a psychiatric disorder and vice versa.   This is especially so, for example, in elderly patients and alcoholics.Relationships between the disciplines concerned with physical illness and those concerned with mental illness will be strengthened by basing specialistpsychiatric services in the local general hospital.3.9  A parallel relationship to that between the psychiatrist and his medicalcolleagues is developing between the psychiatric nurse and her colleagues ingeneral hospital and home nursing. he psychiatric nurse is able toprovide a direct service of advice to nurses and health visitors working in thecommunity or to nurses in other parts of the general hospital.3.10 The specialist team should be equally willing to seek the advice of others -particularly primary care staff - in considering the overall needs of individual
patients in. their care, especially over arrangements for discharge from hospital.3*11 Another important function is to promote for other professional staff,for voluntary workers, and perhaps most important, for the families of mentally ill people, formal and informal opportunities, for example discussion   groups,for learning about mental illness.Service to a district3.12- Although their headquarters maybe in a hospital - be it a mental hospital or the psychiatric unit of the general hospital - the specialist therapeutic teams should see their responsibilities in terms of a commitment to the people and services of the &apos;district&apos; as awhole, and not simply to the hospital.   Some members of the team are likely tocarry out their work directly in the patienfs home.   Of particular importance is the development of psychiatric community nursing services.   These are of value not only to patients and their families but also to the nurses themselves,in giving those who have hitherto worked only in a hospital setting new insightsinto the implications of mental illness in the home.3.13 A vital function for the therapeutic team is the provision of a 24 houremergency service which can be provided in the patienfs home when necessary.This crisis service should be planned in consultation with the primarycare services and is essential if families in particular and the community in general are to be able to cope with a higher proportion of the mentally ill being oared for outside hospital.   Where such a &quot;crisis intervention&apos;service is available it can often help to avoid admission to hospital.3*1^ On the basis of the staffing guidelines set out in Chapter 9 each healthdistrict is likely in due course to have at least 4 consultant psychiatrists sharingresponsibility for the district service.   Whether the district should besubdivided so that each consultant led team has ultimate responsibility for aparticular geographical section, is something which should be determinedlocally in the light of the views of the professional staff concerned.   If this approach to the organisation of the district service is adopted it should always be sufficiently flexible to allow patients and general practitioners a choice of consultant.
Social work staff3.15 The staff of the personal social services are of fundamental importancein the new pattern.   Their contribution includes work with individuals,families and groups, and residential, day care and supportive domiciliaryservices.   The underlying objective in this respect is to help people andtheir families to cope with the emotional, social and environmental problems,and any residual disabilities, which may accompany mental illness or itsaftermath.The role of the social worker3-16 Successful rehabilitation entails the deployment of a whole range of services of which the health and personal social services are only a part;housing, employment and education, and the voluntary services, can be particularly important.   It is the concern of the social services departmentto see that all services are mobilised in helping the mentally ill and in supporting their families.   The relationship between the social services andthe other agencies concerned is thus of crucial importance; in some instancessocial services staff may need to undertake a liaison function in explaining the needs of mentally ill people and the nature of the help they need fromthe other services.3.17 The unifying element in these activities is the professional skill ofthe social worker, whether deployed in fieldwork, in primary care inresidential or day care, or in hospital.   The importance of these skills inthe care of the mentally ill calls for some general account here of the roleand responsibilities of social workers in this respect.   It is the professionitself which has the main concern with assessing and developing its own role,and there is no intention of trespassing on this responsibility, but a brief statement of general principles may be of help to members of the other professions whose work brings them into close contact with social workers,and also to the wider public.
3.18   A major aim of social work in relation to those who are or have beenmentally ill is to take into account all the surrounding social factors and to assess, in combination with other professionals as appropriate, whether a continuation, rearrangement or exclusion of some of these, or perhaps anintroduction of new social factors, could enable a client to cope more easilywith the stress of mental illness.3.19   This entails getting to know him as an individual, trying to maintain a consistent relationship with him, and through this relationship, perhapsmodifying some of his disabilities; having a working knowledge of the symptoms,treatment, course and prognosis of his illness; being aware of his particularfamily relationships and offering psychological and practical support to themembers of his family; knowing about the various ways in which relatives are affected by the illness; discussing the situation as fully as possible with theclient, his family and others who are involved in treating and helping him;and assessing whether or not it is realistic for him to live at home.   If livingat home is thought to be a suitable plan then the social worker has an important part in assessing under what conditions this would be possible both for theclient and his family.3.20  &apos; T-he social worker needs to be familiar with the whole range of support services whether these emanate directly fromthe primary care team, the specialist therapeutic team, the local authority social services department, or voluntary organisations, or indirectly from other services such as housing, social security, education, and employment.   The socialworker must not only Know what is available but must apply professional skillin considering what is likely to be best for the individual client.   Social work should always include him as a partner from the outset.He may well refuse to cooperate in certain important respects and, if this is so, the particular task of the social workeris to build up a relationship over a period of time which may enable him tobecome more willing to accept help.3*21   One of the skills of the social worker is to recognise the likelihood ofthe presence of mental illness even where symptoms appear in the form of social problems and where the client has not been in touch with medical services, andto give the most appropriate help to these clients as well as to those who havebeen diagnosed as mentally ill.   Such help may take a variety of forms - offering a friendly contact, giving practical advice, the development of an individualrelationship, participation in family therapy, group work or community work.The social worker has to take into account all the limiting factors eg scarce
resources? lack of co-operation, and continuing mental illness.   He  has torecognise that the commitment to the client may be long term and may includeworking with him in hospital, and in the community, sometimes alone and sometimeswith other professionals.   Moreover, without suppressing the client&quot;s independencethe social worker has to maintain or establish varying levels of contact withkey people in the client&apos;s environment.   This skill is acquired with training and practical experience; though supervision and consultation are essential inorder to keep abreast of new developments and to adapt to varying professionaldemands*   For example in a specialist therapeutic team the social worker will be working as a member of the team and contributing to the whole treatment planfrom the beginning? whereas the social worker in a social work area team may wellbe working alone with mentally ill people who have never been formally identified as such and who are unable to accept any contact with medical services.Organisation of social work3.22 The internal organisation of social work services, and their relationships with the health services, are at present in a state of transition.   much attention is being given to these questions following the transfer on 1 April1974 of hospital social workers to local authority employment, and the reportof the Working Party on Social Work Support for the Health Service^.   Many ofthe issues involved can only be resolved by the field authorities themselves and the members of the social work and other professions.   The Government(sconcern here is to draw attention to the special needs in relation to the care of the mentally ill which require to be taken into account in the futured development of services.3.23 Following the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970 personal social services for the mentally ill, as for other clients, became the responsibilityof the new local authority social services departments.   This development wasthe subject of some criticisms,   and concern was expressed about what was seen asthe loss of an established service with specialist skills in dealing with theproblems of the mentally ill.   There are, however, many positive advantages formentally ill people in this integrated pattern of services.   Many of the socialneeds of the mentally ill are of a general kind not arising specifically fromtheir illness.   An integrated service places at their disposal the full range of resouces that the local authority and locally based voluntary services can offer.   It also makes it possible for help to be part of a comprehensive pattern of social care taking into account every aspect of a mentally ill person&apos;s socialcircumstances; for example, the repercussions of the illness on children, or* HMSO 1974
the effect of the presence in the family of another handicapped or elderlyperson.   An individual&apos;s or a family&apos;s social problems may come to noticebefore an associated mental illness is recognised, and the social servicesdepartment&apos;s concern with a broad range of social problems may be the meansof identifying mentally ill people who are not known to the medical services.An additional advantage is that the mentally ill can have access to the localauthority social service resources without having a specific label attachedto them,3.2*f   Nevertheless it would be foolish to pretend that unification of the social services has not brought many problems in its wake.One of the aims of unification of social services was to ensure that authorities in deploying their services would take into account a wider range of priorities.   But in a developing social service which is still not equal to all the other demands being made on it, there is a real danger that groups such as the mentally ill will be given a low prioritycompared with other groups whose needs are more overt, as well as being betterunderstood.3.25  There is indeed an increasing recognition that following the implementation of the 1970 Act, there has in some instances been too much dispersion of specialist skills, and that a nucleus of staff is needed with special expertisein- fields such as mental illness, who can act both as a source of advice forother social workers and as a link with other specialist disciplines.   If raisesgeneral questions about training which are touched on further in Chapter 9*3.26  This should not involve any separation of social work with the mentally illfrom other social work.   Mental illness may or may not be a factor in a whole range of social problems, and its presence or absence is often uncertain.   Inthese circumstances work with the mentally ill is bound to remain an integral part of most social workers&apos; caseloads.   But the presence within social servicesdepartments of staff who possess special expertise, and their ready availabilityto advise their colleagues, should lead to greater awareness in the social services generally of the needs of the mentally ill, and ensure that help isnot given only when crisis point has been reached.
3.27 The best way of providing this special expertise will vary but thereis clearly an important role for the social workers who are members of the specialist therapeutic teams.   From this point of view the social workerbased in the hospital can give valuable help to his colleagues in thecommunity.   Conversely, hospital-based social workers can only provide an effective contribution to the work of the therapeutic teams if they are ableto call on the full resources of the social services department and of otheragencies outside the hospital.Social work support for the health service3.28 Although the details of the relationship between specialist therapeuticwith local circumstancesteams and area social work teams will vary, the report of the Working party on Social Work Support for the Health Service makes a strong recommendation that hospital based social workers should come fully within the organisationof the social services department.   Depending on the number of social workersin a particular hospital, they might either work together as a separate social work team or be linked into the social work area office structure.   the boundaries of health districts do not always correspond with those of social services areas and it may or may not be practicable to arrange that a particularsocial worker in the therapeutic team deals with patients from a particularsocial services area.   The Working Party has emphasised the importance ofcontinuity of care and of avoiding rigid barriers which prevent eithercommunity-based social workers from seeing clients in hospital, or those based in hospital from seeing them outside.3^29 Similar considerations apply to the relationship between social workersin the area teams and those attached to primary care teams.
Volunteers3&apos;30* As well as giving practical individual benefit, voluntary helphas a particular value as a spontaneous expression of the community&apos;s concernwith the well-being of those of its citizens suffering from mental illness,and voluntary activity can itself be the means of awakening and spreadingconcern of this kind.3,31. Help from volunteers i6 more effective if it is efficiently and sympatheticallyorganised, and organisers of voluntary services have been appointed in a numberof hospitals and by many local social services authorities.   The Governmenthopes that this practice will spread.   As well as ensuring thatthe volunteers are efficiently deployed, it is important that recognitionand understanding is given to their motivation for helping.   Volunteers wish to demonstrate their interest in and concern for the mentally ill, and willmoreappreciate being to learn/about the problem than ispossible from contact with one or only a few patients.   All will wish to besatisfied that they are making a personal contribution that is of real value,and it is important that care is taken to ensure that the help they are askedto give is such as will bring its own rewards.   This will mean assessing the potential of each volunteer and looking at the job from his point of view.3.32 It is important to recognise that volunteers are not professionally trained.They should not be seen as a means of filling gaps and deficiencies in thestatutory services,, but as having a distinct and complementary contribution in giving the friendship, support and help that comes from a genuine personalconcern.   Their lack of training may mean that they will be distressed by someof the experiences they encounter, and for this reason they may need supportthemselves, perhaps^the form of opportunities to discuss their experiences withwithout in any sense breaking confidentialityother volunteers and with the benefit of advice and comment^ from one of the professional staff.   They must be shown how to identify situations which requireprofessional skills to handle, they must know how to summon help, and such helpmust be at hand.Voluntary organisations3*3o Voluntary organisations have been the pioneers of many new developments inrelation to the mentally ill0 -
They draw their strength from their independenceitof statutory authori^y^and/ is important not to tak,^ away the initiative of the voluntary movement and with it the enthusiasm and the freedom ofaction on which it relies.
Statutory authorities, whether at central or local level, have many competingpriorities to consider and it is important that the users of particular services, particularly those unable adequately to make their own case, shouldhave their needs properly represented and understood.   Organisations whichcombine access to expert knowledge with an independent stance have a uniquepart to play here.Voluntary help in hospitals3&quot;3 f.Vblunteers are a bridge between the hospital and the community outside,and one that is much needed particularly where hospitals are large and isolated.The greatest contribution they can make is perhaps to make individual patientsfeel they have a friend who has a real concern for them and is willing and ableto give constructive help.   They can also act as a catalyst in encouragingpatients to participate in social activities, such as dances, discussiongroups, clubs, film shows, drama groups and games.   With the help of hospitalstaff they can make arrangements for excursions, visits or holidays outsidethe hospital for individuals or groups of patients.   These activities have much importance as a means of encouraging patiehts to develop and extend theirown individual interests in the world outside.   Patients will, of course, gaina great deal by being involved themselves in the organisation and selection of activities.3&apos;3$ Volunteers can help patients maintain contact with their own families and friends outside the hospital, for example, by providing transport forvisitors and helping to arrange baby sitters.   Some patients, particularly the elderly, may need help in reading and writing letters.
Voluntary help in the community3.TkMentally ill people living outside hospital have the same needs forfriendship and social activity.The dangers of social isolation should not, it is true, be as great in a home or hostel whose residents mostly go out during the day, asthey are in a large and remote hospital.   But many residents will themselves have spent a long time in hospital and their difficulties in establishing ovre-establishing social ties may be considerable.   A home or hostel, particularlyone that has just opened may not have an established network of contact with the outside world, and a positive effort is needed to ensure that the home does not become inward-looking,-This applies particularly to long-stay homes in whichthe dangers of an institutional atmosphere are perhaps greatest.   Volunteerscan help by befriending residents and encouraging social activities and socialcontacts generally.   Day centres are another focal point for help of this kind.A close relationship is needed between volunteers and day and residential carestaff and the planning and organisation of these services should take the voluntary contribution into account.3.3*7 Voluntary organisations at present provide some 27$ of the residentialhomes and hostels and lk% of the day centre places for the mentally ill.The proportion may fallas, the expansion of. local authority services envisaged takes place.   But the voluntary organisationsscope for trying out new forms of help,.needed.will always be- In particular their role in pioneering services for special groups like alcoholics or drug addicts,and in providing shelter, support and rehabilitation for homeless single peoplewithout a settled way of life is still growing and with the formidabledifficulties local authorities face at present in finding resources for keyservices may well need to grow still further though in a new partnership with thestatutory authorities.33B Group homes (see paragraph h.kk) are a form of direct help which many localvoluntary organisations have developed with success.   As well as finding andacquiring suitable housing, there is a great deal which volunteefcs can do to help with the practical problems.   The bridge which volunteers represent betweenresidents and the rest of the community is particularly needed in group homeswhere residents live without the support of permanent residential staff.   Settingup these homes calls for very close co-operation between voluntary organisations and health and social services authorities.   Assessing whether a particular group will be compatible and will be able to manage on
their own calls for skilled professional judgment.   Moreover, the help whichvolunteers give in running a home needs to be supplemented by various formsof social services support.3.3*1 People who are or have been mentally ill are of course living in a variety of other settings, for example, in their own flats, in family housingor in private lodgings.   The danger of loneliness and isolation is likely tobe greatest among people living on their own.   Someone who is preparedto visit regularly and take a friendly interest can make a very great difference to the quality of their lives.Financial support3.40 As well as involving voluntary organisations in the planning of their statutory powers to give themservices, local and health authorities have /     direct support both financiallyand by making facilities available and the Government hopes that this means of encouraging voluntary effort will be used as fully as resources permit.   Ofcourse, the developing services for which authorities are directly responsiblerepresent a heavy financial commitment, but a healthy level of voluntary activityis itself an important factor in the effectiveness of statutory services.   TheGovernment, for its part, will continue to give financial support to voluntaryactivity which has general relevance to the needs of the mentally ill..Family Care3*hl It is important to remember that in practice those in the community mostinvolved in the care of the mentally ill are families.   the implications of mental illness for the family, particularly when it isprolonged, are far-reaching.   The responsibility of looking after a mentally ill relative may be very great    * and a family which, for example, is caringfor a relative who has a long-term schizophrenic illness inevitably finds thewhole pattern of its life drastically altered.   Relatives of this importantgroup of mentally ill people have now formed their own organisation which isseeking to identify the particular difficulties experienced and ways of helping the families to manage, and to bring these to the notice of statutory
authorities.   This development is very much welcomed by the Government.   Agreat deal car.&apos; be learnt from the experiences of families about ways in whichservices can be made more responsive to individual needs, and their voiceneeds tc be listened to when policies and priorities are being determined.
CHAPTER the DISTRICT service this chapter describes the various units that together make up the localdistrict network envisaged in the new pattern of services^   For the sake ofclarity they have to be described separately; but it is fundamental that theyshould be seen as inter-dependent and as together constituting an integratedwhole -Health services the general hospital psychiatric unitk.2   The psychiatric unit at the district general hospital is intended as thecentre of specialist psychiatric treatment of mental illness for all adults,including the elderly4 from its health district.   Patients who need to becompulsorily detained under the provisions of the Mental Health Act should alsobe treated in the unit unless their clinical condition makes this clearlyinappropriate.   Experience suggests that most forms of difficult and disturbedbehaviour can be contained by a high level of staff observation and supervision,combined with the use of locked rooms, on occasion and for limited periods^ fornursing the most acutely ill.   The general hospital psychiatric unit is expectedto be able to deal with nearly all the small number of disturbed patients on this basis.   Only when a patient is recurrently so difficult or dangerous that histreatment requires special security measures continuously and for a period of weeks rather than days should his care be regarded as beyond the resources ofa local unit.   The special provision required for such patients is considered in Chapter 5*   Separate facilities are also required for some elderly patientswho after assessment are found to be in need of longer stay hospital accommodation.These are described in paragraphs k,&quot;\2 - **.16 below.^.3   The general hospital psychiatric unit is envisaged, not simply as an in-patient department, but as a centre providing facilities for treatmenton both a day and in-patient basis, and as the base from which the specialisttherapeutic teams provide advice and consultation outside the hospital0The unit has two main functional components: the wards, or ratherresidential units, and the day hospital or day activity area.Only a very small proportion of inpatients will need to remain on the wards during the day.   Thegreat majority will be up and about and will be able to leave the ward to spend the day on a planned programme in the day hospital, returning to the residentialunit at night, thus having the stimulation of a changing environment and a
CONFIDENTIALpattern of living which more closely resembles normal everyday life.4.4   The great majority of in-patients will be discharged in a matter of a fewweeks: the wards on which they sleep will normally have not more than 30 beds,sub-divided into single bedrooms and bedrooms with 4 or 5 beds which in theirlayout and design will aim to provide a friendly non-clinical atmosphere.   Somepatients may stay in hospital on a 5-day week basis, going home for the weekend.However, even with the most thoughtful design, a hospital ward has limitationsas a home for patients requiring longer-term care.   Those patients thereforewho need specialist medical and nursing supervision for longer periods should sofar as possible be treated as day patients while living either at home or in ahostel nearby. ^     3^ need for long stay inpatient facilities is considered in paragraphs 4.52-54 below.Day hospitalmore than.5   The day activity area is the hub of the unit. Rather/half the day hospitalplaces would be used by the in-patients, the other places being filled bypatients coming to the hospital on a day basis.   It should have facilities for treatment, including an ECT suite, together with consulting rooms and offices for the various professional staff and separate rooms for group and individualtherapy.   It should also provide a wide range of occupational and rehabilitationactivities.   The Design Guidance published by the Department of Health and social security allows space for 8 different occupational areas, which might for examplebe used for educational, clerical and industrial work, dressmaking, art andmusic, as well as a kitchen in which domestic skills can be relearnt.   The unitshould have its own dining room and facilities for leisure activities in theievening and at weekends.4.6   Where the district general hospital serves a large geographical area it may be appropriate to provide an additional separate dayhospital where it can meetthe needs of the outlying community. A peripheral day hospital might be provided in association with a community hospital. The guideline for day places in aeeoargjg day^ hos^italUith no inpatients attending) is about 0.3 places4.1  Some out-patients may attend the unit for specific treatments, but as a rule out-patient facilities should be provided either at the hospitals general out-patient department, or at community hospitals or in health centres.   The latteroffer a particularly valuable opportunity for providing specialist servicesnearer to the patient&apos;s home and enabling the psychiatrist   and other relevantmembers of the specialist therapeutic team to consider individual cases inconjunction with the general practitioner and other members of the primarycare team.   The latter will in turn have the stimulation and interest ofinvolvement with a specialist therapeutic team and of being able to maintain a closer interest in their patients&apos; progress.
Guidelines for beds and day placesThe scale of provision suggested for psychiatric units in general hospitalsis a minimum of 0.5 beds and 0.65 day hospital places per 1.000 total population.The ratios are of course in terms of the new pattern of care envisaged, in whichthis particular element is only one part of the whole network of provision.Experience so far has been limited to facilities operating in isolation, and not as a comprehensive serviceyand uncertainty must attach to the effect theprovision of local integrated services will have on the pattern of demand forpsychiatric treatment and care.   On the 0ne     hand there is little doubt thatlocalfacilities once established attxtact more patients. Moreover psychiatric units ingeneral hospitals receive many referrals from the medical and surgical departments of the hospital.   On the other hand if patients come to seek treatment earlierand if higher levels of staffing make it possible to provide a better service,it may be that some more serious episodes will be prevented. -Tiie ratios are necessarily no more than a consideredassessment of the requirement.   They may well need to be modified as the pattern of local facilities develops and new trends beoome more clearly established.Such evidence as is available so far would suggest that the day place ratioin particular may need to be raised.Facilities for the elderly4.^1 Mental illness in old people is often too easily regarded as untreatable,but experience has shown that early intervention can be particularly effective.AssessmentMQ The physical uprooting of an old person is in itself a traumatic experience and may intensify existing anxieties or create new ones; assessment of mentallydisturbed elderly people should, wherever possible, take place at home or inout-patient clinics.   However, admission to hospital is necessary for some; andunSerlstfmalel11 ear*y brie^ admission for assessment purposes only ghould not beIndeed at present the elderly form 20-25&amp; of all admissions to psychiatrichospitals and the age specific admission rate for the elderly age group is higherthan for any other.   In the new pattern of service admission would in most cases be in the first instance to the general hospital psychiatric unit.   In some districts a psychiatrist with a special responsibility for the elderly has beenappointed and there may be advantages in this arrangement, particularly in facilitating links with geriatric physicians,      primary care teams and social services departments.
^.1*   Many elderly patients hpve both physical and mental&apos;&apos;symptoms and jointassessment by a psychiatrist and a geriatric physician is desirable.   Where ageneral hospital psychiatric unit is in being, closely related to the geriatricdepartment, this joint assessment can take place in either department; but wherea general hospital psychiatric unit has yet to be establish^&apos; facilities shouldgenerally be provided in a joint assessment unit in the geriatric department at the general hospital.   Although in such cases clinical responsibility forthe assessment unit as a whole would normally fall to the geriatric physician,the psychiatrist will needs to be involved in admission arrangements andassessment should be a
joint responsibility.   Patients would not normally remain in the assessment unitfor more than about 4 weeks, patients needing further treatment being transferredto the geriatrio or psychiatric wards as appropriate.   The size of such units will vary according to the local admission and treatment policy.   A unit of10-20 beds should serve for a population of about 250,000, and in some districtsit has been found sufficient not to set up a special unit but simply to designatea few beds in the geriatrio department of the general hospital for joint use bythe geriatrician and psychiatrist. As geriatrio and psychiatric departments becomeprovided in general hospitals in olose proximity to each other the need forspecial joint assessment beds is likely to diminish.k- 1&apos;X   The extent to which in a general hospital psyohiatric unit elderly patientsshould be treated separately or with patients of other ages will depend on individual requirements and is best left for local decision.Facilities for the Elderly Severely Mentally Infirmif-13*   A proportion of elderly people will, after assessment be found to needcontinuing hospital oare.   The vast majority of these patients will in practice be those suffering from dementia, and their continuing care will not entail the wide range of diagnostic and treatment facilities of the general hospital.Their need is rather for nursing supervision by group observation, with individualnursing attention as occasion arises throughout the 24 hour period.   Althoughcast such patients who have no significant physical illness or disease are atpresent oared for in mental hospitals, small long stay units are now being developed in local hospitals where numbers can be kept manageable and where theinterest of friends and relations and local communities can be more easilymaintained.   The general hospital may serve this function for the people living inits immediate vicinity.k-14-,  Bed provision, which it is anticipated will increasingly be made in communityhospitals as these are developed, is thought to be needed on the soale of 2.5-3*0beds per   1,000 population aged 65 and over; this is equivalent to the numberof beds at present occupied by patients suffering from dementia in mental hospitals and is thought to represent the requirement for persons needing hospitalcare for this condition at any one time.
Besponsibility for admission would rest with, the psychiatrist to whoa the patients will have been referred for assessment and who will in some cases be a psychiatrist with a special interest in the psychiatry of old age.   Bayto day medical care       may be given by local general practitioners working at the community hospital.   Admission, treatment, and discharge policies will beestablished between the psychiatrist and the medical staff of the communityhospital in the light of policies adopted for services in the district; there willalso need to be close links with other consultants on the physical needs of the patients.   There will normally also be a geriatric longer-stay unit sited at thecommunity hospital which will include among its patients those sufferring fromdementia who have in addition some significant physical disease or illness.   Herealso there is a call for close oo-operation between!the geriatrio physician and the psychiatrist.4.1b.   Longstay accommodation for the elderly severely mentally infirm could besited close to the longer stay geriatric wards and should, wherever possible beon the ground floor.   There should be a day hospital adjoining the wards for the elderly severely mentally infirm with capacity for 2.0 - 3.0 day places per 1,000population aged 65 and over.   The day hospital will serve both the in-patients,many of whom are likely to benefit from a fairly active day, and patients from thelocal community who are able to return home at night.   Detailed guidance on the design of long-stay accommodation and day hospitals for such patients is underconsideration by the Department of Health and Social Security. ik&apos; 17. The nursing staff caring for the elderly severely mentally infirm may need to include both psychiatric and general nurses.   With the passage of time, somepatients are likely to develop physical illness which, while not always necessitatingtransfer to the geriatrio unit, will often require general as well as psychiatricnursing care.   Nursing requirements are particularly demanding and it is essentialthat some   staff   should   have   had both psychiatric and geriatriotraining.   The remedial professions too have a considerable contribution to make tothe care of patients suffering   from severe mental infirmity.   Physiotherapy isessential to prevent or ameliorate physical deterioration.   Patients&apos; lives shouldhe made as interesting, enjoyable and active as possible and a wide range of occupational therapy and social activities is needed.   Handicrafts, social functions,musical entertainments, bingo and simple games such as skittles have all beentried successfully.   There is much scope for       unqualified helpers.,      .Services for the elderly severely mentally infirm sited atcommunity hospitals vill provide &apos; Sf-i
more scope for local voluntary help and for collaboration with the primary care teams - general practitioners,health visitors, home nurses and social workers - and fcr the involvement ofpatients1 families and friends.   Relief can he given to families caring for anelderly relative both by making day hospital care available and by occasionalspells of admission to provide holiday or emergency relief.Social Services facilities4.11,   Critics of recent trends in care have seen the present serious deficiency in the number of homes, hostels and day centres for the mentally ill as a majorbarrier to achieving a transfer to community care, and substantial expansion of as soon as economic circumstances permitthese servicesyis an essential element in the Government*s strategy.General policy^.1(1.   There are^/^distinct but related needs - for social ears and for rehabilitation.The length of time for which social care is needed varies greatly.   For some it isno more than a relatively short period perhaps for acclimatisation on leavinghospital, for recovery from a domestic crisis, or for a temporary relief of family stress.   Others may however need shelter for a very much longer time, insome cases throughout their lives.k*%Q.   It is easy to underestimate both the time and the amount of help which maybe needed to recover from a mental illness.   If the help given is insufficientor inappropriate the whole endeavour of treatment and rehabilitation may fail.It is very important that needs should be individually assessed and that daycare and residential care should be geared to meeting individual requirements.It is importan /?o recognise that these needs differ in nature as well as extent.Some people may be fairly self sufficient in one respect but need a great   dealof help in another; for example someone may be able to hold down a job but may notbe able temperamentally to manage life on his own.   If he has no viable familyties, some form of sheltered accommodation is essential.   The aim always should be to respond to individual needs rather than to pursue generalised goals which for manyof the mentally ill have little relevance.4. 2L  This implies a range of services that is both varied and flexible.   Variousforma of residential accommodation are needed to cater for different degrees ofdependency and for different lengths of stay.   Day oentres need a variety of facilities which, within a single establishment, can be used flexibly to give
effective help to each individual.   Residential and cay care services should heconceived not as a self contained s/stem but as part of a broad range of options -extending beyond the health and personal social services - for helping   thementall;&quot; ill.   This range of options should include ordinary housing as well asresidential care; and open and sheltered employment as wc-1 as day care.Every possible opportunity shouldhomes.and day centresbe taken to develop links between/      aria the general life of thecommunity.   This i.m may be defeated if homes and day centres are provided on thesame site; the resulting complex is liable to be seen as. and indeed to become.a self contained institution separate from the outside world.   At the same time,reasonable ease of travelling between the places where people live and those where they go in the day-time is clearly import^uat.4*21    The development of residential, day care, and scoial work support services must be co-ordinated.   Prom the patients point of view, discharge from he jpitalto a community which lacks the hospitals f&apos;silities for day time shelter and occupation may well be a change for the worse.Estimates of ne^dU. 2^.   The precise extent of the expansion of residential and day care servicesthat is needed is not yet certain.   T-la has-been the subject of a number of research studies and in the light cf these studies - guideline targets for health and Social Security,provision were published in a aircular issued in 1972 by the Department of/ Theseguidelines are regarded as provisional targets and are re-producedbelow.   More experience and research are still required in this field and theGovernment wishes to emphasise116^1&apos; tentative and general character *The level oi local need can only be fully determined in the context of the individual locality.   Health and social services authorities should pooltheir knowledge so that as full a local assessment as possible can be formed.This should take account not only of the known numbers of mentally ill peoplebut also of        factors which are known to be associated with a high incidence ofsuchmental illness/as poor environmental conditions and high suicide and attemptedsuicide rates.1*.. 24*   Detailed guidance on the design of homo, hostels and day centres for theand applicable to both new ar1 adapted premises^mentally ill/is being prepared: by the Department of Health and Sooi&amp;lSecurity.
Day Care4.25     Day care services involve a wide assortment of activities with variedgoals for different individuals, and maintaining the necessary sense of purpose and direction calls for skill in management and planning.   Day careservices are at present perhaps the least developed of all mental health services.   There is a need for pioneering work, and it is important that new experience is shared as widely as possible.4.26    It is not easy to draw an exact line between the functions of daycentres and those of day hospitals; and there is moreover an area of overlapbetween the role of day care and that of sheltered employment.   The planning of these three services in relation to each other thus requires particular care.   Day centres, like day hospitals, have a broadly therapeutic role, but their orientation is social - unlike that of the day hospital where the activity and therapy form part of a treatment programme under medicalsupervision.   On the other hand the therapeutic accent, and the mixture of social and work - directed activities, distinguish day centres from shelteredemployment services - even though rehabilitation for employment is animportant part of a day centre&apos;s function.   Health, housing, education andemployment services all have a contribution to make, as do the voluntary organisations which indeed may well provide a substantial part of theservices.4.27    Some local authorities have been successful with mixed services inwhich mentally ill people share facilities with one or more of the other groups, hut there is not enough experience yet to show whether this is asatisfactory long term arrangement.   There is room for further experimentswith such an approach provided sufficient flexibility is retained (eg in the design of centres) to permit the introduction of a degree of separationbetween different groups if experience proves it necessary.Aims of day care4.28   On one level the goal of day care is to meet clients&apos; immediate needs for shelter, occupation,
and social activity.   In so doing the centre may also serve to relieve the strain on the clients family of lo &quot;ring after Lim during the day, or conversely to givethe client himself a fev hours away from the family.   In *ome cases this may he, what makes it possible for the client to on)inuIiving at home.,V*hilefor some the help which the centre gives will be needed for a long time, for others it could be a relatively short stepping stone towards eventual independence.This is not to imply the existence of ^clearly differentiated groups.   Only a tentative judgement may initially be possible about an individuals capacity forprogress and the length of time for which he  will between-? support.   A more definiteopinion can only be formed over time on the basis of regular reassessment.   Inany case jeonle can be given an increasing degree of self reliance even though they need a measure of long term support, and the difference in individual goalsis more one of degree than of kind.   In i*?e overriding aim of improving the quality of life, the long term support which some people need is just as important as the help given to others to achieve complete independence.4u 2 f.   of the    main elements involved in day care, the first is help with difficultiesinforming or maintaining personal relationships.      A. second involves help with problems   of adjusting or re-adjusting to the demands of work.     &amp; third consisiaof encouraging the realisation of theindividUp&amp;IWal capacity for a. generalfuller and more rewarding contribution to the life an&apos; work cf \: ycommunity,and for a deeper enjoyment of his own life.   It is important that no one element,for example work processes, should be allowed to dominate the whole programme.Cultural and educational activities - for example the study of art, music, dramaor literature - have a valuable part to play.   So^e may need to learn aboutcooking or housekeepingsThe general pattern of work activities will ner^ to reflect the social profile ofworkthe district, but it is important to include white collar/and suoh office work astyping, duplicating and printing as well as work of a more industrial character.Organisation of day centresM. 3c.   More important than the exajt mix of activities is the way they are planned and organised.   Thosj attending the centre should be encouraged to take partin this process; their involvement in shaping the programme should not only help
to make it more relevant but should also be a means of developing self confidence and self reliance *   In keeping with this aim, the centre should not be allowedto become a closed community which seeks to meet all its users&apos; needs; rather itshould be seen as a focal point from which they may move out to use general public services.   Libraries and the adult education services are examples.4.3*1   The key to effective use lies in individual assessment.   This involveslooking at each individuals present level of functioning and drawing up a programme of activities needed to help him reach better adjustment.   Such an assessment will only be valid if the staff of the day centre bring into consultation those who have the relevant professional knowledge about the clienthimself.Assessment is a continuing process and theprogramme of activities should be reviewed periodically in the Iight of theclient*s performance and changing needs.   The programme should, of course, take as much account as possible of his own expressed wishes.   Consideration will need to be given to what is to happen when he stops attending the day centre; andarrangements will need to be made to ensure that those who can move into paidarework are encouraged to do so and/identified at the most appropriate stage forassistance through the assessment, rehabilitation, training and resettlementfacilities of the Employment Service Agency and Training Services Agency.The Disablement Resettlement Officer will have&quot;a significant role to playat this stage.4.3:1   . Day centres    call for staff having their own considerable range of skills, supplemented by advice from other social services staff and from, forexample, psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses and teachers as necessary.Day Centre Planning Guideline4.33 The guideline planning figure for day centre places for the mentally illis a ratio of some 0*6 places to 1,000 population.Location of day centres4.3*7- ^e ma-i-n consideration in deciding the location of day centres is probably the need for an accessible service.   Good public transport
5U-facilities are important, and wht/.e these are inadequate the social servicesdepartment may need to make some transport arrangements of its own.   The questionof siting is obviously related to that, of size, since a heavy concentration of dayplaces in a single centre will make it less accessible for those who live further&quot;away.   Equally though, it is undesirable for day ce. ires to be toC small;   with fewer than say 40 places it will be very difficult to provide a full range of services.Exceptionally in densely populated areas, a centre might have aj many as 150 places,Social Clubs4.35     Social clubs are a valuable supplement to day care, particularly for people whoare busy during the day but lack opportunities ijr social activity and friendship.Running ana organising such clubs may be a particularly suitable activity for voluntary organisations, especially where local authorities are ready to help yrxthfinance -nd general guidance.   Some people-j who have been mentally ill may benefit from the opportunity to help others by themselves participating in the running of aclub.   Mutual support of this ki..d may be of particular value for groups such asagoraphobics where contact can be made by correspondence or telephone between phobicswho find it difficult to make their way to facilities at a distance from the?r home.Residential Care4.36     Residential services have to meet a variety of needs.   But whereas a day centrecan be relatively large and so can encompass many different activities under one roof,homes and hostels have to be reasonably small if ;.n institutional -atmosphere is tobe avoided.   In order to provide effectively for a range of individual needs, homes and hc-tels will need to offer a number of alternative patterns of living.4,37     The Department of Health and Social Security&apos;s planning guidelines for hostelsand homes have differentiated &quot;between short-term and long-term needs.   There is a risk that such distinctions may be too rigidly applied.   In particular it is unrealistic tomake decisions about the duration of stay requi:.3d when someone first euters thehome or hostel, and the choice for. an individual client &quot;of a particular type of.accommodation should not be determined solely by this.   The deciding factor shouldbe the extent to which the alternatives available meet tho individuals needs at thetime and his own preferences.4.38    The broad choic should be between hostels providing a relativelyintensive programme of rehabilitation;    staffed homes;   small group honesand lodging schemes.     For some mentally ill people the underlying problem
vill be one simply of housing.   Close co-operation is needed between social services and housing authorities to ensure that such problems are recognisedaspectand tackled in the most appropriate way.   This/Is discussed further in chapter One 0f the aims of residential care is to help people to achieve a reasonably stable pattern of life and to develop the capacity to cope with the various pressures of daily living.

Thil^ls discussed further in chapter  6. One of the aims of residential care is to help people to achieve a reasonably stable pattern of life and to develop the capacity to cope with the various pressures of daily living.

The suggested guideline level of provision is 8-10 places per 200,000 population in an area of &quot;average need&quot; and10-12 places in an area of high need.   The function of hostels is closely linked with that of the specialist   psychiatric   services.   Their basic purpose is toprovide intensive care and rehabilitation on a relatively short term basis.This may represent a periodof acclimatization during which someone who has left hospital can gradually get usedto the pressures of life outside, or sometimes the   hostel may provide a temporary
but much needed retreat from these same pressures for a person who is not soseverely ill as to require admission to hospital.   There should thus be noset pattern which all residents have to follow; the approach to rehabilitationcan only be decided in the light of each individuals needs and problems.   Thisis a highly skilled judgment   and it is important that the staff of the hostelsshould be carefully selected and that support should be readily available fromtheir colleagues in the social services and health professions.Participationby residents in the running of the hostel is often a valuable part of rehabilitation.   The element of freedom of choice is important, andshould be reflected in the design and organisation of hostels.   Residents shouldhave their own rooms and be able to get reasonable privacy when they want it.10 or at the most 15 is probably the maximum number of residents which iscompatible- with an environment of this kind.  .Staffed homes4- 42    Staffed homes are a form of accommodation offering  continuing support,and in which, while rehabilitation remains an important element, the emphasis ison providing a home.   Many of the people needing this form of help are those whohave spent a long time in hospital and who, although they have left behind the acute stage of their illness, have lost their roots in the community and would find it difficult to form new ones.   Another group are those who have depended for their support on relatives who have now grown old or have died.   A home in which people are likely to stay for a long time must be designed to fit into  and form part ofthe wider community? and the total number of residents should not be more than about 25.   A domestic and informal atmosphere is important.   The design should allow for the formation of small groups within the home, but with sufficient flexibilityto allow for individual choice.
Unstaffed Accommodation4$,   There are various forms of unstaffed accommodation which can he used tomeet both long term and short term needs for shelt*r^   but     without the same degree of support as in staffed homes.   There is scope here for experiment with new solutions, depending on what the locality has to offer.   Unstaffed accommodationsay in some instances be planned in conjunction with staffed homes; for example number of bed-sitters may be provided in the same locality as the staffedhome, where people can live independently but with access when they need it tohelp from the staff of the home.^44   An approach which has been tried with some success is the group home.    Thesehomes have been shown to be suitable for people who can manage more independentlyhut who - perhaps because their own family ties have been lost - need the mutualsupport of living together in a small compatible group.   Ordinary flats or houses are suitable for this purpose.   The success of a group home depends largely onthe selection of a compatible group of people.   To enable the domestic side to run smoothly it will usually be necessary to arrange at the outset for one ofthe residents to act as housekeeper and this means selecting as a residentsomeone who has both the aptitude and       inclination for this role.   Social worksupport is essential, particularly during the early weeks or months when the membersof the group are settling down to life together and need advice on financial,catering and other domestic matters.   It is a considerable help for the social services department to underwrite the rent so that, for example, the departure ofone of the residents does not leave the group in an impossible financial situationuntil the vacant place is filled.M .  Group homes are a relatively economical  and straightforward form of accommodation, and represent a tangible form of help which can often be givenby voluntary organisations.   It is important to realise, however, that grouphomes are not by themselves a sufficient alternative to hospital care, and theyshould not be established without arranging adequate opportunities for employment or day care for those residents who need it.Supervised LodgingsM6  Supervised lodging schemes, which a few local authorities have developed quiteextensively, are a rather different form of long term support.   There are twoCONFIDENTIAL 57
main patterns - the lodger may either live more or less independently in asub-let room, or as part of a family.   In either situation the landladytherepresents the first line of support, and / selection of landladies, and the choice of lodgers, require a good deal of care.   Social work support and adviceshould be available to the landlady no less than to her lodger. There may be scope;-or extending this arrangement to families v,he.re there is a mentally ill parentwith dependent children.Guideline for Staffed Homes and other Long Stay Accommodation^41*   Guidelines for the various forms of longer stay accommodation suggest foran area of &quot;average need&quot;, a minimum of 30 places for a population of 200,000.At least 10 of these should be in staffed homes and at least 15 in the other types of accommodation.   For an area of &quot;higher need&quot;, the overall minimumsuggested is 48 places, with at least 16 in staffed homes and at least 24 inother accommodation.
Carej. for the elderly mentally infirm4.49 Paragraphs 4.12-4.16 discuss hospital provision for elderly people whoare severely mentally infirm.   There are also however many elderly peoplesuffering from dementia in a form which is not sufficiently severe to warrantadmission to hospitals   For the most part they are cared for in their own homesby their families with the support of primary health care and social servicesbut some are cared for in residential homes.   Many local authorities makeplaces available for them in old people&apos;s homes, sometimes by way of a separatewing or floor: some provide homes especially for elderly mentally infirmresidents.   The Department of Health and Social Security is examining theadvantages and disadvantages of the various methods adopted by local authoritiesand may issue guidance on the subject in due course.4.4*$ The point at which mental infirmity is severe enough to be beyond thescope of residential care is not easily discernible: indeed the condition ofan old person suffering from dementia may vary from day to day.   Nonethelessthere is a need to clarify the relative responsibilities of the health and social service authorities in respect of the care of the elderly mentally infirmso as to secure the most effective deployment of the resources available; andthe Department of Health and Social Security intends to mount a research projectto this end.   Other matters under consideration by the Department are thedevelopment of joint medical and social work assessment procedures to facilitate the most appropriate placement of elderly mentally infirm people no longer abletoto be cared for in their own homes and/facilitate subsequent transfers betweenresidential homes and hospital where changes in their condition make thisappropriate.   More generally, in the light of the increasing age and frailtyof residents of old people&apos;s homes consideration is being given to the need forfurther guidance on arrangements for providing medical and nursing care.The long term care of the chronic mentally ill4.5-0 Earlier paragraphs have already referred to the importance ofthose       - albeit a small proportion of all who suffer from psychiatricdisorders - who are likely to need a high level of support and care, includingresidential care for prolonged, indeed in some cases indefinite periods.   Howwill their needs be met within the new pattern of service?The *old&apos; long stay patients4,51   At the time of the Census of mental hospitals in 1971 there were 104,638occupied beds in mental illness hospitals in England (respresenting 2.27 perIvOOO population), of whioh 75,923 (1.65 per 1000) were occupied by patients whohad been in hospital for more than 1 year.   Of this group 57&amp; (0.94 per 1000)
had been in hospital more than 10 years; 39% (O.65 per 1000) more than 20 years.The treatment which these long stay patients received when first admitted -indeed the severity of illness which necessitated their admission -will have varied very considerably according to the time they were admitted.Many of them, were they to suffer the same illness now might not requireadmission at all but would be treated as out patients or day patients, or ifthey were to be admitted, might stay weeks or months rather than years.   Manyof them are still in hospital not because they need specialist hospital servicesbut because they either need other forms of shelter and support whicK^at presentnot available outside hospital, or have become so accustomed to hospital life - in some cases so institutionalised - that it would be inhuman todischarge them from the hospital that has in effect become their home.   It isthese patients who are often referred to as the &apos;old&apos; (as distinct from the&apos;new&apos;) long stay patients.   They are not easy to define in numerical terms.They can be defined only perhaps by saying that they represent those patientswhose need for long stay hospital care is the result of past - and less advancedpatterns of treatment - rather than for hospital inpatient services as such.There is little doubt that virtually all those patients who have been in hospital20 years or more would fall into this category.   So too would a substantial number of those who have been in hospital more than 10 years, many of whom wereadmitted between 1951 and 1961, the decade when new treatments were just being developed.   Even those admitted 5-10 years prior to the census will not havehad the opportunities which exist now for day hospital treatment and will havebeen treated in hospitals with far lower staffing standards than those of today.The &apos;new&apos; long-stay patients4.52 Nevertheless, it is clear that despite advances in treatment and staffingthere are still significant numbers who become long s^ay^pa^ients.   At the timeof the Census 21,540 (0.V7 per 1000 population) had been in hospital betweenof O.44   .1 and 5 years. 3y 1972, this group had declined by about 1000 patients to give a rate/their numbers areIt is also clear that to a considerable extent/(this is)the result ofa   lack of other more suitable facilities rather than a need for hospitalinpatient care as such.   The Department of Health and Social Security has recentlysponsored a research study carried out by Professor Wing of the characteristics of this * new&apos; long stay population.   The study deliberately concentrated on new long stay patients other than those suffering from dementia, since separateprovision for these is envisaged in the new pattern of service (see paragraphs 5.1?. - 4.16 and ^.48-4.49 above).   The study examined a sample of patients agedunder 65 who had been in hospital more than 1 and less than 3 years, with the aim of establishing whether they were still in hospital because they needed 24hour medical and nursing supervision or whether their needs   mould have been
more appropriately met by other kinds of residential facility had these been available.   (A preliminary account of the study is given in &quot;Providing a comprehensive District Psychiatric Service for the Adult Mentally 111&apos;)*.It estimated that about one third of these newly arising long-stay patientsneeded 2k hour medical and nursing supervision - and that the remainder, exceptfor small numbers in special groups, required varying degrees of shelteredenvironment in the community.4.53  The third who were felt to need 2k hour nursing care with medical over-sight, were drawn predominantly from those suffering from chronic schizophrenia.Such patients are particularly prone to be slow and withdrawn and liable toneglect themselves.   While a general hospital psychiatric unit could probablyprovide a satisfactory living environment for patients staying for periods upto a year or therabouts, it would not be a suitable &quot;home for the small numberof chronic patients who might need hospital residential care for longer,perhaps indefinite.periods.   On the basis of his study, Professor Wing hasestimated that the number of hospital places required for &quot;new long-stay&apos;patients aged under 65 would be about 0.17 per 1,000 or 30-35 in an averagehealth district.   This would of course only meet the needs of the newly arisinglong stay patients in a local service.   It is important to appreciate that theguideline figures given in this Chapter are in addition to the beds - graduallydeclining in numbers - which will still be required for many years to meet theneeds of the &quot;old long stay patients&apos;) referred to in paragraph ^.51 above^ whoare already in the mental illness hospitals.Hospital hostelsk.^tf. Ontapproach to meeting the needs for hospital residential care for newlong-stay patientsjwhich it is hoped to test in a research project at Southamptonis a form of hospital hostel.   On present thinking such hostels are likely to be fairly large houses reasonably close to the general hospital psychiatric unit,wi th the patients being care $fin a domestic atmosphere but with night nursingsupervision.   By day they would either attend a day hospital ora. local authorityday centre or perhaps go out to sheltered work.   Such a unit would be aimed not simply at providing long term psychiatric care as such, but rather at a socialenvironment with a slower pace and tempo more appropriate to their disability.Brain damage*f.55 Mention should also be made, in the context of long term care, of patientswith head injuries some of whom are at present nursed in the mental illnesshospitals.   Multiple problems are presented by people who suffer acute brain* Department of Health and Social Security Reports on Health and SocialSubjects No. 8 HMSO.
damage, whether traumatic or due to vascular accident and at the present time they are dealt with in a variety of different ways.   Some people developbehaviour disorders after brain damage and need referral for psychiatric care;depending on the circumstances this may need to be given either as an in-patientor as a day or out-patient.   Others, depending on the degree of residualdeficit, may in time need placement with the younger disabled or the olderdemented.   But one of the aspects of the care of this type of patient,particularly with the younger patient who has suffered trauma, is that slowimprovement over a very long term can sometimes be expected.   This makes it essential for such patients to be regularly reassessed and their treatmentregime altered as necessary.Present uncertainties and future planning4.5fc   It is clear that unless and until there are further major breakthroughsin the treatment of the more disabling psychiatric conditions, some chronicmental illness will continue.   There is an urgent need for more research intothe overall size of the problem: Professor Wing&apos;s research looked at patientsalready in hospital, but little is known about the chronically disabled in thecommunity whose needs are unmet or are being met only at the price of nearintolerable strains on their families.or who are perhaps living with elderlyrelatives who will be unable to cope with them for much longer.We also need to know more about theneeds of the group in terms of       Services how many, given the comprehensive network of local services envisaged for the future will requireresidential care, as distinct from-say-day hospital or day care facilities.How many of those requiring residential care will need hospital residentialcare and how many accommodation in a sheltered environment outside hospital.There is some hope that as services improve and are able to offer earlierintervention and more intensive support the numbers of those needing long termresidential care may ultimately decline.   Until local comprehensive services are in being and we are able to monitor their effectiveness planning mustnevertheless proceed on the basis that there will continue to be a number ofmentally ill people - though smaller than hitherto - who will need long termresidential care, and that some of this will need to be in a health servicesetting.Care of people without a home or settled way of lifeThe mode of life of those men and women who have no settled home and havedrifted into the way of the single homeless - using lodging houses, receptioncentres and derelict houses for shelter and sleeping rough from time to time -is not in itself a reason for discussing them in a Command Paper on services for the mentally ill, still less for referring them to the psychiatric services.
But a number of different studies have suggested that the prevalence ofpsychiatric and personality disorders, as also of alcoholism or drug misuse,is especially high among such people, both among the drifting youngsterswhose problems are discussed in Chapter 7, and those whose way of lifeapproximates to that of the traditional vagrant.4.59 In a recent survey at the Camberwell Reception Centre, only 13$ of themen who had received in-patient psychiatric treatment were homeless at the timeof their first admission to hospital.   This would appear to lend support to the theory that rather than homelessness having been a precipitating factor in theillness the long term effects of the men&apos;s psychiatric condition and the inadequacy or unacceptability of the services provided to help them may have led to their becoming and remaining homeless.   It should be emphasised that though the number of men in this group suffering from some degree of psychiatricafterdisorder or its/Effects may be large, the number in immediate need of hospital treatment is much smaller.   There may also be a group who are unable, or highlyunlikely, to benefit from further treatment, but liable without some continuingsupport to create problems for themselves and other people.k,      The problem is that men and women who are homeless v     .- -. &apos; are particularly difficult to help.   Hospital staff and others in the mainstream of such servicesoften find it difficult to communicate with and help people who seem alienatedand unco-operative and whose response to the help they give may be poor.   Theirlack of an address and settled way of life may make it difficult for them tofind and go to a general practitioner, keep appointments or make use of health services: some discharge themselves from hospital without completing theirtreatment, and others who do complete treatment are sometimes discharged without proper after care arrangements and with nowhere to go because of the difficultyof finding the right sort of supportive accommodation.   The new patterns ofpsychiatric care now being developed may increase the difficulties of this groupbecause of their emphasis on active treatment, and the fact that many of theday and residential services provided for the after care of the mentally illare not well geared to helping people without a settled way of life and may noteither attract or accept them.4.60 These special difficulties of homeless people need to be recognised by workers in the health and social services everywhere.   In areas where there arelarge lodging houses or reception centres special thought needs to be given tothe psychiatric services required.   Local authority or voluntary staff workingwith the homeless can be helped by the psychiatric services to accept and cope
with the residual effects of mental illness in some of their residents.   Ingeneral it is thought that special psychiatric services are not required for those with an unsettled way of life: when they need treatment they need simply -like everyone else - to be treated effectively, promptly and with understanding.Some hospitals serving the central areas of cities where homeless rootlesspeople congregate have particular experience in caring for them, but more needs to be known about how the psychiatric services could be of help.   An experimentis to be mounted at Bexley Hospital which should throw some light on this.After care arrangements need particular attention.   It is essential that plans are made well before the time of discharge for men and women whose historyshows they are likely to need especially well-chosen arrangements for after careif they are not to slip into, or back to a drifting way of life.   The problemof homeless men who have been mentally ill are overlaid and exacerbated by thegeneral shortage of cheap accommodation for single people, and how much theneed may be for special residential services to provide this type of man withcare and support may not be clearly seen until the supply and demand   for single person   accommodation is more nearly in balance.   Included in the Housing Act197^ is the provision that, for the first time, local authority expenditure onhostels will be included in the housing revenue account.   The Act also providesfor a considerable increase in the help available to housing associations bymeans of housing association grants designed to cover the whole spectrum of housing need including self contained and hostel accommodation where the primaryof Health and Social Securitypurpose is to provide housing.   In Circular 37/72 the Department/invited localauthorities to set up   experimental projects to meet the needs of homeless singlepeople requiring care and support in a residential environment.    Somehomeless men tend to be suspicious of a structured.mode of living, or anything in the nature of residential &quot;care&quot;: they will seek out hostels or lodginghouses offering only food and shelter.   But others will accept help with theirproblems if it is offered in ways which take account of their eccentricities andthe style of life they have adopted.   Experiments are on the way in some areas to explore the possibilities of special day and residential services in thecommunity.   A number of voluntary experimental services emphasising the socialrather than the physical environment have had some success in attracting andhelping men who shun other types of help.4.63. Social workers need to develop skills in working with men and women who aredoubtful about accepting help: their confidence may most easily be gained in anunstructured environment - perhaps a day centre - where relationships can be
built up and assessment take place in an unhurried and non-threateningenvironment.   Some men easily become institutionalised, whether in hospital,prison or a residential setting, but experience suggests that where they are able to exercise choice about where they are to live and are involved in theday to day running of their own lives and the management of the hostels or daycentres they use, there is more chance of their leading a more settled life withfewer calls on the psychiatric and social services.Regional and sub-regional facilitiesif.63 The table below summarises the various elements described in this Chapterto be achieved as economic resources allow-which together form a network of district services/   Facilities are requiredin addition for particular groups of patients whose numbers are not large enough to warrant services for them in every district.   These additional facilities, namely regional security units and facilities for mentally disturbed children and adolescents, are described in Chapters 5 and 7 respectively.   They are an essential complement to the local district services and should be seen as an integral part of the mental health service.

CONFIDENTIALCHAPTER 5SECURITYTreatment in conditions of security5*1     Patients should he treated with the minimumdegree of security and supervision commensurate with their condition at anyparticular point in time.   Every effort should be made to ensure that no patientis subjected to unnecessary restrictions on his freedom.   Some patientsunfortunately are, at some stages of their illness so continuously difficult orunpredictably violent that there is a need for them to be closely supervised andfor their movements to be under strict surveillance.   In these cases, in order toprotect both the community and the patient himself it may be necessary to imposegreater restrictions than local district services can provide; in these cases aplacement in a regional security unit or in a special hospital may be necessary.Careful consideration must be given to each individual case before a place in either of these types of secure provision is made especially since both are likelyto be remote from the patients   home and family thus making rehabilitation moredifficult and because of the inevitable stigma which still attaches to treatment in conditions of security.   Careful consideration is of course required whenpatients are being transferred from a more to a less secure environment, but itis important that all concerned in the mental health services should be receptiveto transfers of this kind and should do their utmost to provide the after-care and support which is perhaps needed in these cases even more than in others.   only if there is sufficient confidence between the different parts of the service asa whole can there be appropriate movements in and out of these types of provision,and only then can a full and flexible service be provided in order to deal withthe needs of patients as they vary over time.   It is important that there shouldbe good co-operation between the local services and these secure services.situation where no patient is in a regional security unit or special hospital whosecondition does not require treatment in conditions of that degree of security;in other words such placements should only be made where there are positivereasons for doing so.5.2   Regional security units are intended for patients who are continuouslybehaviourally disturbed or who are persistently violent or considered a danger to the public, albeit not an immediate one.   The units will provide physicalsecurity but will not be expected to deal with the very persistent and determinedabsconder or patients for whom release attempts might be made.   Special hospitalswill continue to deal with the most dangerous and violent patients and those whowould, if they were to abscond, present an immediate threat to the public.   Thespecial hospitals aim to provide sufficient physical security to prevent aThe aim should be to arrive at a security units
determined absconder from leaving the hospital although they are not expectedto guard against a determined outside attempt to release a patient.5.3  Hospital authorities were recommended in T961 to provide for patients needingsecurity either in regional units 0r in provision in each hospital.   MostRegional Hospital Boards opted for the latter course but there were increasingdifficulties in the latter 1960s as more and more hospitals became entirely open.A working party report has recently recommended that regional security units should be provided in all Regions, and the Department of Health and Social Securityhas commended this to health authorities.   The report also made recommendations about the ways in which such units should be organised and operated.   Theprovision of regional security units is also recommended in an interim report bythe Committee on Mentally Abnormal Offenders.   Further guidance on these units..(including design aspects) is being produced by the Department of Health and social security. The training needs of the nursing staff concerned are being considered by thedevelopmentJoint Board of Clinical Nursing Studies and field authorties will be advised of^in due course.Some Provision for adolescents5,4    The question of secure provision for adolescents is a difficult one.Adolescent psychiatric units can provide security of the kind which comes from close observation and a high level of staffing, and regional psychiatric units may be expected to provide a degreeof security beyond that;- while there is a very small number ofadolescents whose mental condition results in dangerous or violentbehaviour to an extent which requires the facilities of a specialhospital.   None of these is however necessarily the right place foradolescents whose aggressive, anti-authority, anti-social anduncontrolled behaviour is not significantly related to mental disturbance.The concept of the Youth Treatment Centre providing a combination of long term care, control and treatment, security and education for thoseyoung people exhibiting difficult behaviour who are neither appropriate for community homes nor for psychiatric units is being developed at the st Charles Centre, Brentwood; but there has not as yet been sufficient time to evaluate it.   In fact, much has still to be learnt about themost suitable form of care for these disturbed and socially disruptiveyoung people.
Special Hospitals5.5   The Special Hospitals provide accommodation for patients detained for treatment whose dangerous, violent or criminal propensities mean that their treatmentmust be carried out in conditions of special security.   The three existing specialhospitals which already house some 2,300 patients (of whom .1,570 suffer from mental illness or psychopathic disorder) are under serious pressure.   Moreover the physical conditions at Broadmoor are most unsatisfactory.   The opening of a smalladvance unit of the planned fourth special hospital, named Park Lane, has easedthe position a little, but Broadmoor remains overcrowded. The first stage ofPark Lane Hospital is in an advanced stage of planning.   The transfer into it9f patients from Broadmoor will&apos; make it possible to start rebuilding wardaccommodation.at Broadiaoor.100 additional places5*Broadmoor will then take fewer patients than at present and there will be about/altogether.   We shall need to reappraise the national requirements for accommodation for patients requiring this high detree of security in the light of experienceof the operation of the regional security units and of any relevant recommendations by the Committee on Mentally Abnormal Offenders.Forensic psychiatric services.7   In recent years there has been a welcome   development of specialised forensicpsychiatric services, though somewhat sporadic and uneven.   Most forensicpsychiatry is still carried out either in prisons and special hospitals, or byconsultants who have major commitments in other fields.   The need is for eachregion to develop a forensic psychiatric service in conjunction with the HomeOffice facilities and the regional security unit.   In regions where no accessibleHome Office facilities exist consultants will need to be appointed wholly withinthe NHS.   A forensic service includes facilities to cope with the growing demandfor assessment (particularly   court referrals) and for treatment and after-care.
CONFIDENTIALCHAPTER housing AND EMPLOYMENTHousing needs6.1   Some of those who leave psychiatric hospital after inpatient treatment needspecial support and rehabilitation.   Ways of providing such residential care are described in Chapter 4.   But many others who leave hospital are ready to returnto an ordinary home immediately, needing no more than minimal support from social services.   For most people there is no problem   about this; but there are certaingroups for whom it presents serious difficulties.   Where for example a mother&apos;sillness has in part been precipitated by the stresses arising from the housing in which she was living, a return to the situation which proved too much for herbefore may prejudice her chance of a full recovery or even cause a recurrence of her illness.   For single people who are admitted as inpatients, there is a danger that when they leave hospital their previous accommodation will not beavailable and, while social services staff will endeavour to prevent this, theymay not always succeed.   People who, before admission, were used to a shiftinglife of lodging houses and reception centres need a chance to live in a morestable and secure environment if they are to maintain their recovery.   Some formerpatients, though not needing professional care, need the companionship or support which comes from sharing a home with others with similar problems or living inlodgings with a welcoming and understanding landlady.   Finally, there are the many patients in psychiatric hospitals who have been there so long that theyhave no homes to return to though they would be able to live a largely independentlife in the community if suitable accommodation could be found for them.6.2  In all these examples what is required is essentially ordinary housing ratherthan any special form of residential accommodation; and it is right to look tolocal housing authorities, working together with the local authority social services departments, to find ways of solving these problems.   It would however be wrong to think in terms of a rigid dividing line between the residential servicesdescribed in Chapter k and the accommodation made available by housing authorities.There will be areas of overlap between the two.   For example a group homeisay be in a flat or house rented by the social services department from thehousing department - or, and this is the procedure which should be followedwherever possible, the social services department will merely supervise the overall management including rent payment and provide any necessary social worksupport.   Ideally the various forms of accommodation described here and in chapter 4 should be seen by local housing and social services authorities as providing between them a range of accommodation from the purpose-built staffedhostel to the ordinary council house with only occasional social work support.a period of residential careinvolving
6.3   In the administration of their stock of housing and in allocating tenancies,housing authorities give special consideration to people whose health is beingdamaged by the conditions in which they are living.   In this context mental illness is one factor which may warrant priority, either in the allocation ofa council tenancy, or in obtaining help from a housing association with aspecial interest in such problems.   Security of tenure is of particular importance to those suffering or recovering from mental illness, and should beborne in mird by housing agencies; it may tip the balance in favour of a council tenancy.
g.4   The housing problems a single person recovering from mental illness mayface in returning to the community can be as great, indeed sometimes greater,than those of a patient with a family.   Housing authorities have traditionallygiven priority to the needs of families, and single people have largely been expected to find their own accommodation.   Increasingly however,the special housing needs of single persons are being recognised by local authorities, andthe Department of the Environment has itself given attention to ways in whichthese needs can be met.   A variety of forms of accommodation can be provided,for example clusters of small flats of the kind described in the Department ofthe Environment&apos;s Design Bulletin 29 &quot;Housing Single People&apos;.   Under the housing act 197^ local authorities and housing associations are able to receive forhostel accommodation the same sort of housing grants and subsidies as areavailable for other forms of housing. It is hoped the new arrangements will encourage provision of hostels for, among others, people who need limitedsupport.   The greater security of tenure given under the Rent Act 197** forfurnished tenants will also help many vulnerable people who live in furnished accomodation.6.-D As local authorities and housing associations make more impact on thehousing problems of single people, particularly in the central areas of large cities, ways will more readily be found by housing and social servicesauthorities of solving the housing problems of people who have been mentally ill.Housing aid centres, whether run by local authorities or voluntary bodies, maybe able to help find single people somewhere to live in privately rented accommodation.   Housing associations, particularly those established to help
people who are mentally ill, and other voluntary bodies may also be able to help,and housing authorities may be able to make mortgage facilities available to housing associations planning a housing scheme with someone to look after the tenants.   Some of the suggestions made in the Joint Circular from the Departmentof the Environment and the Department of Health and Social Security on Homelessness(DOS Circular 18/7*0 are also relevant; for example the need to remove thedisincentive to council house tenants who wish to have a lodger.6.^  The housing needs of patients who liave been in mental illness hospitals formany years but no longer require continuing medical and nursing care should notbe overlooked.   Obviously the rate at which such patients can return to thecommunity will be constrained by the community&apos;s capacity to meet their need for both housing and social support, but there should be an underlying recognition that hospital is not a satisfactory alternative to home.   In cases where people are in hospital remote from their former home or relatives, the planning of a move from hospital to home will normally be for the housing and social servicesauthorities in whose area the person1s home was before being in hospital.   Insome cases, patients in hospital may no longer have contact with the place theyonce came from, and will have developed a number of links in the area of thehospital.   They may more easily be able to make a home in the neighbourhood, andlocal authorities who interpret their responsibilities flexibly may be able tomake this possible.
Employment Needs6,7 Mental illness and its aftermath all too often involve a tragic waste of human potential.   Part of the challenge is to minimise this by helping each individual to reach a level of employment commensurate with his potential.This is no way implies a cynical view of our responsibilities to the mentally ill.   The individual frustration and unhappiness of someone who sees hisabilities going to waste may be no less real than the loss it represents tosociety.6.sq Mental illness tends to affect people&apos;s capacity for work in two ways -impaired functioning and changes in work attitude.   Impairment of functioning,for example difficulty in tolerating stress or a high level of responsibility,cannot always be overcome and some long-term reduction of capacity may have tobe accepted.   If so, an important target of rehabilitation will be thedevelopment of this reduced capacity; this may involve, for example, training for some less demanding form of work.   Changes in attitude to work on the other-hand, are more amenable to improvement through a carefully planned programme oftreatment and rehabilitation.   Acquiring or regaining the ability to work effectively is often a necessary part of recovery from mental illness, and ifa satisfactory resolution of work problems is not achieved the likelihood ofrelapse is increased.Range of services.^ Some health and social services activities, for example hospital industrialtherapy units and local authority day centres, are directly relevant to employment needs.   There is however a limit to what these services in theirpresent form can do.   Their concern, by and large, is necessarily with problemsspecifically associated with mental illness.   Moreover, the level of expertisewhich health and social services staff can develop on the specialised teaching of employment skills or basic work habits is inevitably limited by their otherpreoccupations.   The Government&apos;s view is that specialised facilitiesexclusively for the mentally ill should be used only to the extent that theyare justified by the special character of their needs.   Help with the generalemployment needs and problems of disabled people is provided mainly by the
wide range of resettlement services under the aegis of the Department ofEmployment and the Manpower Services Commission, and the Government is anxious that these services should be used as fully as possible by all people who can benefit from them, including those who are recovering from mental illness.These services include Employment Rehabilitation Centres, training at SkillCentres and elsewhere, sheltered employment and the Disablement ResettlementService, with its function of placing people in the most suitable form of openor sheltered employment.6.16   The employment and training services described in paragraph 6.11, and theoperation of the quota scheme for disabled people, have been comprehensivelyreviewed over the last two or three years with the object of making them bettersuited to meet the needs of disabled people.   In carrying out this review it hasbeen fully recognised that people who are or who have been mentally ill alreadyconstitute a substantial group of users; and that this group is likely to expand in the future.   The review has been conducted in consultation with theSecretary of State for Employments National Advisory Council on Employment ofDisabled People on the basis of a number of consultative documents or discussionpapers dealing with different aspects of the services.   Agreement has now beenreached on the broad lines on which the employment and training services providedfor disabled people by the Manpower Services Commission should be developed; anddetails of these developments have geen set out in the plans published by the commissions Employment Service Agency and Training Services Agency in 197^*The main developments are summarised in the following paragraphs.   decisions about the future of the quota scheme and of the arrangements for the provisionof sheltered employment have yet to be taken.The PRO service.1.. The key figure in assisting with the resettlement of mentally ill peopleinto employment is the Disablement Resettlement Officer (DRO).   Through his knowledge of employment skills and local occupations and his experience andtraining in assessing working capacity, the DROS function is to assist and advisestaff at day centres, psychiatric hospitals and units on the readiness of patients to enter sheltered or open employment, to help them find it, and toadvise on the appropriateness of employment rehabilitation and vocational training courses.   He should arrange the next steps for admission to such courses and the selection of suitable job opportunities on their completion, includingintroductions to employers and preparations with existing employers for thereturn of former employees.
Ihe number of experienced senior DROs is being doubled and the training givento new entrants nae been lengthened and recast.   Special attention is paid duringtraining to the needs of the mentally ill.   The experimental introduction of hospital-based DROs is dealt with more fully in paragraph 6.19*Saployment Rehabilitation   been mentally ill6.I3   Employment rehabilitation for people who have  /  is available at employmentrehabilitation centres run by the Employment Service Agency and at workshops run by other organisations.   The aim of these centres is to help people to become asfit for employment as is possible within their physical and mental limitationsand to assess the most suitable kind of employment for them.   Such assessmentwould have particularly in mind the need to avoid undue stress and conditionslikely to cause recurrence of mental illness.   A research unit is to be set upby ESA shortly which will investigate the methods of rehabilitation used with aview to greater flexibility and variation of courses and facilities.Vocational Training6.14- The Manpower Services Commission through the Training Services Agencyprovides a wide range of vocational training courses intended, in relation to the individuals capabilities, to develop existing or provide new skills for employment.For those who need it, training under residential conditions is provided by fourcolleges run by voluntary organisations with financial support from the Agency.Sheltered Employment6.1 fT Sheltered employment, organised either in special workshops or under definedarrangements with outside employers, has a well-established role in providinglong-term employment for people who have a more or less permanent impairment of capacity.   There are many mentally ill people with long-term limitations ontheir endurance, capacity for responsibility or powers of concentration, who canbe usefully employed in this way.   At present many of the mental hospitals arein effect providing sheltered work of a kind for the mentally ill, but with the diminution of the role of these hospitals and the expansion of residentialfacilities in the community for the mentally ill there is likely to be an increasedneed for sheltered workshop places for them.   Discussions are continuing on thefuture role and organisation of sheltered employment in the light of the Departmentof Employment&apos;s consultative document on sheltered employment.   One of the suggestions put forward in the document which is of particular relevance to peoplesuffering from mental illness is that sheltered workshops should make more efforts to promote the long-term rehabilitation of their clients than has generally been
the case in the past.   The Government has not yet reached decisiors on this; andthe relationship of sheltered work to other services for the mentally ill will depend in part on the outcome on the current review.Need for co-operation between services.11?  The health, social and employment services obviously -teed to co-operateclosely in assisting people who are or have bee:, mentally ill.   Hospital industrialemploymentand occupational therapy, local authority d^y centres, and/&apos; &apos;     rehabilitationvocational training, sheltered and ordinary employment should all be used flexiblyso that the individual can draw on a range of services in which his progress canbe attuned to his individual capabilities, psychological dependence and anyresidua&quot;1 effects of his illness.   For those able  ;o attain it, open employment will be the evrntud goal, but it is important also that people should be able tomove back into less demanding situations if the need arises.6.1&apos;/   The joint aim should be to open up as many avenue;  as possible for theemployment of those who have been mentally ill.   As well as making the best useof statutory and voluntary services, it will be important to elicit the co-operationof employers.   Much can be done through informal contact to educate    prospectiveemploy ;rs so that job opportunities are not lost on account of unwarranted fears ormisapprehensiions about mental illness.   Private employment agencies can alsofulfil a useful role; and there are a few agencies which have developed specialisedfacilities for helping mentally ill or other disabled people.6. I 0* The difficulties involved in rehabilitation for employment should not beunderestimated.   Mental illness may in any case result inareduced ability totolerate stress or to take responsibility and clearly work must not subject theindividual to more stress than he can accent.   On the other hand, successful returnto outside employment requires acclimatisation to pressures of this k\nd and willnot be achieved if the atmosphere is too protective.The staff in the different services need an awareness of the special difficulties of mentally ill people sothat they can recognise problems when they arise ard can adjust the pace andvolume of the individuals work accordingly.   In both open and sheltered employment,close links between the management and the psychiatric and social services are needed so that professional advice is readily available on individual and groupproblems.lb
6,1 ^ As   an illustration of how it may be possible to develop closer links betweenthe various services, the disablement Resettlement Service of the employment service Agency has made a number of experimental appointments of DisablementResettlement Officers working full-time in some of the large hospitals.   Oneof these experiments has been at a psychiatric hospital.   It is hoped that the experiments will show that by having a representative of the ESA on the spotinstead of visiting the hospital periodically, patients will be helped to commence suitable employment resettlement programmes at an earlier stage in theirrecovery, and will be referred at a more appropriate time that hitherto for help from the other agencies concerned.   The initial signs are that the experimentshave been reasonably successful.6.2.0 The Employment Medical Advisory Service of the Health and Safety Executiveaspects of employment is to study the medical  /  rehabilitation for those who suffer from mental illnessparticularly where the working environment may have precipitated theircondition; it is also investigating how stressful conditions may be identified and prevented.6.21  The problems of resettlement into employment of mentally disabled people isone of the issues with which the National Advisory Council on the Employment ofDisabled People will be particularly concerned over the next few years.
CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS7.&apos;i   Recent accounts of the prevalence of emotional and psychiatric disturbancein young people, changes in society and developing patterns of treatmentindicate the need for a reappraisal of how problems of disturbance may be tackled and how resources may be better used.   The department of. Health ?proposes to issue a consulation paper which will seek to draw together the .various thread of discussion on both child and adolescent psychiatric services.&apos;It will take account of the recommendations of the committee, under thechairmanship of Professor Court, which is looking t.c the whole field: of child -health services and which it is hoped will rtport in the Autumn.7.2   This chapter is concerned broadly with those up to age 19 although it iswell recognised that there a.-e some people over the age of 19 for whomadolescent services may be more appropriate than those provided for adults.   Nosharp dividing line can be drawn between childhood and adolescence; but it maybe possible to distinguish different problems and different needs in adolescencefrom those applying in childhood.Childrenxhe Nature of Childhood Disturbance7*3   An understanding of childhood disturbance is still developing and the planning and organisation of child psychiatric services in the future hasto be sensitive to this.   Childhood psychiatric disturbance, except in a very few cases, does not present as a definable mental illness; moreover it has tobe seen in the context of normal child development and the inter-action of factors both within the child and relating to the family, school andneighbourhood.   The disturbance may show, for instance, as a disturbance inbodily functions, relationship difficulties, poor educational progress ordifficult behaviour.7.*t   Family factors play a key role; sometimes these are themselves
the result of poor environmental conditions but this is not always so.   Furtherresearch is required into which family factors are most significant and how best to deal with them.   Recent studies have already identified some: these include severe social disadvantage, family discord, poor child rearingpractices, parental mental disturbance, parental criminality, one-parent families, large family size, unwanted pregnancy, and placement of the childin residential institutions.7Environmental factors may also have adverse effects.   Examples are crampedand overcrowded housing conditions, lack of play andleisure facilities, and overcrowded schools.iM Factors within the child include genetic and constitutional characteristics.Physical illness, brain damage, physical handicap or mental retardation mayeach produce an increased likelihood of psychiatric disorder.   Alteredsusceptibility to stress, and educational difficulties such as dyslexia havealso to be taken into account.The needs of disturbed childrenPrevention7.1   Little is known about prevention of disturbance in childhood at present,but as factors which may increase the risk of disturbance are identified it is perhaps not unreasonable to hope that tackling these will help, especiallybecause of their wider implications for the potential development and well-being of individuals and families.   Progress with the very difficult problemsof poverty, inadequate housing, and unemployment can probably only be considered as part of a long-term programme.   On a shorter time-scale, more use of effective family planning methods might reduce other risk factors.early  Recognition and Intervention^       ..lt is especially important that there should be early- . recognition and assessment of the need for helD     a        -iicxp,   a significantfeature of recent years has been the recognition of disturbance in children under 5 years especially in vulnerable families.   All those working with children have to be alert not only to signs of problems developing in the childbut to the implications of distress apparent in other members of the family.The health visitor, through her routine visits to all households with children,and   also the family doctor and local authority social worker are in a special
position in this respect.   All workers should know of&apos; the availablo servicesand be able to get access to them.Treatment7.0)     The term treatment covers a wide variety of different approaches aimed at improving social functioning and developing individual potential to the full.Treatment approaches include individual and group psychotherapy, behaviourmodification techniques, drugs, counselling and social intervention.   Treatmentmay thus be carried out by a variety of specially trained professional workers and in a variety of settings.   It is important for all workers to seek a commonunderstanding of underlying disturbance so that treatment measures may be planned in co-operation.7.10  Treatment of the family as a whole or of relevant members of it is increasing and extended use of this method may affect the perception of thenature of child, parental and family disturbance and the training required-by -those working in this field.   More knowledge of family and group dynamics is needed; and more opportunity for staff to develop skills and insight into these processes.The role of the school7.11 A child&apos;s school may be second only to his home in exerting powerfulinfluences on his growth and development.   Schools can help to tackle emotionaldisturbance at all three of the stages dealt with referred to&quot; above.First, a good school can help to prevent disturbance &quot;arising by promoting sounddevelopment, emotional and social as well as intellectual.   Secondly,children in school   are under continual observation by teachers, who shouldbe able to detect signs of disturbance and, where necessary, take steps to get specialist advice.   Thirdly, ordinary schools can help to mitigate the effects of adverse outside influences on children; with special schools andclasses play an Important part in the management and treatment of children withbehavioural and emotional difficulties. - To enable schools to be effective inall three roles, full support is essential from the network of schoolpsychological, cbpld health, child psychiatric and social work services, whichin turn rely on the schools and classes to provide special educational treatment as part of their range, of options.   Increasingly the need is seen for staff from these services, as well as seeing individual children, to spend more timein schools talking with the teachers.   Through close and imaginative co-operationbetween all the staff concerned, working with the parents, schools can do muchwhich may adversely affect mental health to deal with childhood difficulties^    &apos;in adult life.
Organisation of services.1i  In the Circular on Child Guidance issued jointly last year by the Departmentof Education and Science, the Department of Health and Social Security and the welsh Office, child psychiatric services, together with the school psychologicalservices, the social work services and child health services, were envisagedas together constituting a network of services for children in which, thougheach has its own independent organisation and functions, there are joint working arrangements for dealing with those children and their families whose problemscall for a combined approach by more than one service.7*13  A psychiatric service for children needs to enable the assessment,diagnosis and treatment of all children in the community - and of their familieswhere relevant - who show evidence of mental illness or emotional disturbance.In addition to these basic functions it needs to provide consultation, advice and support for related services and for specialised establishments such ascommunity homes.   It also has an active part to play in the training ofprofessionals in related disciplines.7.1/t- Although hospital services are an essential element of a psychiatricservice for children, and their continued expansion remains a high
priority, the emphasis for the future needs to shift into the community - thehome, tjhe schc 1, health oentre or other community base.   Staff in childpsychiatry need to work much\ of their t..me awa;,  from hospital; in addition to providing clinical treatment, they need for example to provide advice to other children&apos;s services.   Their training should prepare them for this wide role.1c remains for the training bodies to develop and   extendbroad-based training at all levels. Recently devised trainingprogrammes for the further professional training of medical staff alreadyinclude community experience.7.l  v/e must aim not only to meet mental disturbance when it occurs, but topromote mental   well-being, drawing as necessary on a wida range of services- child psychiatric services, paediatrio services, services foradolescents and for the mentally ill generally, primary health care, localeducation services, social work services, the community home sjrstsra, the courand voluntary agencies.Research7.1(9 More study and research is needed into the aetiology, incidence and natureof child psychiatric disorders, into effective methods of treatment and intodifferent patterns of organisation.AdolescentsThe nature of disturbance in adolescents7. [7 The age group involved is itself difficult to define. It is often taken as covering broadly ages 12-19 but neither    &apos; - can be regardedas hard-and-fast limits.   The onset of puberty, which usually occurs by age 13,is commonly taken as marking entry into adolescence, but in some cases thenature of the disturbance may be such that an adolescent, so defined, is more appropriately treated with children.   At the upper end of the age range the boundary is even more uncertain.   Some 17 or 18 year olds may have adultvalues and behaviour patterns which make it quite inappropriate to regard them as adolescents.   Others may, however, retain characteristically adolescentattitudes well into their twenties.   These uncertainties make it extremelydifficult to quantify the numbers involved; the use of the inclusive1 age range12-19 (some 11.5 per cent of the population, a total of about 5*3W^       ionly      an approximation.
7..1QA second difficulty lies in the nature of adolescence itself.   It iswell recognised as a difficult period of development involving problems of adjustment, and of physical and emotional maturation, often leading to disturbedand disturbing behaviour and conflict with established institutions - home,school, and society.   The difficulties are exacerbated by the pressures of adjusting to living in a modern intensively organised society, and to the changing patterns of behaviour of the age group itself and of adolescent valuesparticular to each passing generation.   An individual adolescent may moreoverhave personal problems in connection with his family, educational, religious or cultural situation.   It must be emphasised that the greatmajority of adolescents do not require specific psychiatric help to cope withtheir problems;   mast do not come into contact with any psychiatric servicesnow and do not need to do so.   But at the same time disturbance in adolescencemay in some cases be the beginning of a serious mental illness; and it isimportant that such cases should be detected.7.f^A third factor is that within the adolescent age range may be encompassedan unusually wide variety of life styles.   Most of those of school age liveat home, although a significant minority are in boarding schools, and smallernumbers are in community homes or residential special schools and a stillsmaller group are in hospital.   It iB commonly believed that a small butincreasing number under 16 have simply left home.Of those 16 and over a substantial minority will have left home to live in lodgings, hostels, or halls of residence, and some will live in self-supporting groups in fented flats or houses.   As with younger adolescentssome are in community homes or hospital, and some also are in borstals,detention centres or prisons.   Finally, a phenomenon that has grown in recentyears has been that of young people who do not live in any of the more conven-tional settings, but instead live in communes or are squatfers, sleep roughor are homeless.   This may result from a conscious decision - perhaps basedon social or religious beliefs - or because the individual has drifted or been forced into such a way of life through inability to adapt successfully to moreconventional modes of living.7.20 Disturbance in adolescence presents difficulties in definition, in thatdiagnostic categories of mental illness as defined in adults apply only toa small proportion of cases.   Disorder must be seen, as in childhood,in relation to the interaction between individual and environmental factors.The maturation and development that takes place in adolescence makes itdifficult to differentiate behaviour directly related to a psychiatric condition
from that which relate&quot; to a transitory or impaired phase r&quot; development andwhich may involve a crisis in identity or in personal relationships.   Thus thepresenting problems are a complex of interlocking psychological and socialsymptoms.   Thcrse may show themselves as difficulty in adapting in the family,at schr^l, or at work; lose of self- ;onfidence; anxiety or depression;difficulties in inter-personal relationships with individuals; antisocial ordelinquent behaviour; aggression; deviant sexual behaviour; drug-taking orheavy drinking; attempted suicide and suicide; and are often as inwardlydisturbing to the individual concerned as to those around him.    Adolescentswho do require psychiatric treatment are thus thought to need a particularlybroadly based approach, often involving the family and other agencies, anuaimed largely at improving social functioning.Need for psychiatric help7.?&apos; There -re ;?loo particular difficultien in rocotynisir^ the adolescent v.heeeds psychiatric help in a sense that is not true of children and adults.   For children, recognition of needmay occur through the family, the primary health care team or, particularly with the expansion of the school psychological service, through the school.For adults it may come about thro gh evident social malfunctioning.   For theadolescent, however, particularly the oluer adolescent, these contacts mayhave been lost; and while social malfunctioning may be an indicator of need,it will often be disguised by patterns of behaviour that wouldbe abnormal among adults but are rot uncot.. ion among young people.   Conversely,the risk of       &quot;exaggerating leed for psychiatric help is     very real.The comm ri assumption that because an adolescent is behaving in an anti-social way the answer i;-i recourse to a psychiatrist is not founded on resultsor on a realistic view of the psychiatric manpower likely to be available.    Inpractice some problems of adolescence    may      require little more than abetter understanding from adults of this phase of human development; and whenspecialist help is required it may not be clinical psychiatric help specificallybut a mult.&apos; -disciplinary approach based on psychiatric understanding withcontributions from a variety of professional workers.7*22, Disturbance in adolescents is thus seen as encompassing social, educational^vocational and medicil factors&apos;-      -s number of differeuc agencies, of whichpsychiatric services are only one, need to be involved.   For example, some special schools, the yuth service and further education have an important contribution to make in providing opportunities for disturbed adolescents tocontinue their education and in re-establishing them in the community.7.2,3&apos; Even when an adolescent has been identified as requiring psychiatrichelp he may refuse or reject it.   This may be because he associates it with
values or institutions of the adult world which he suspects or rejects.   Othersmay find it difficult to see the need for help because of a lack of realityin their own outlook or in their relationships with others.   Many otheradolescents are afraid of being classified as abnormal or as sick.   Some may consider that it is society or the world about them that needs to change.Organisation and planning of services.24 The ways in which psychiatric services for adolescents have developed inthe past have differed greatly.   What seems to be needed for the future isthat services should be organised so as to meet the special needs ofadolescence.   This means that for each facility, whether already in existenceor in planning, consideration needs to be given to the way in which it relates to other facilities for adolescents in the area, and to the levels and type of staffing and training for them that are required.   There is a particular needfor health authorities together with local authorities to agree on the levelof psychiatric support that they can give to the many agencies requiring it:community homes, the special education service, school psychological services,school and student counselling services, Social Work Services, the PrimaryHealth Care Teams, the Youth Service, the Courts, the Probation Service and voluntary services.   The psychiatric services also need to assist in developinginsight into the nature of adolescent disturbance.   As children and adolescentsspend so much time in school and in further education, links with the education services are also important.Provision of facilities7.2!? However, before real progress can be made towards providing comprehensivepsychiatric services for adolescents it will be necessary to fill a number of well-recognised gaps in some of the basic requirements.   In the clinical fieldalthough there has been marked progress in the last decade in the provision ofinpatient and day-patient places for adolescents, they are still only about a third of what has been estimated to be required, and there are some HealthRegions which have no such facilities at all.   Moreover some existing inpatientunits have not yet developed a wide enough range of facilities to meet thevaried needs of all groups of adolescent patients, with the result that such provision as there is cannot always be fully used.   In the social services field,the number of day places and hostel places is still meagre and a significantproportion of the relatively small number of hostel places occupied byadolescents are provided by voluntary bodies, generally catering only forcertain selected groups.   In the community homes system, further provision is needed for difficult adolescents, some of whom are disturbed and may needpsychiatric oversight, or in a relatively small number of cases treatment.
7.2^Various forms of walk-in advisory clinic have developed in this countryand in other countries in Europe, and have demonstrated that, if appropriatelypresented, such informal facilities have a real part to play.   They need tobe closely related to other counselling services, particularly those whichsnring from what are outwardly applications for practical help, such asadvice about accommodation, birth control, suspected pregnancy, work problems,drugs or drinking.   Often requests for help over a problem related to the family may be a danger signal.   To work effectively this entails a readyavailability of psychiatric help; and such developments will be heavily dependent on the manpower that can be made available.Staffing7.2,7 At present only a limited number of psychiatrists have specialised in work with adolescents, and the scope for an increase is restricted by lack of specialised training.   It is for the professirn itself to decide what training is required in this field and in particular whether there should be a separatespecialty of adolescent psychiatry.   The Government is aware that thisquestion is presently under discussion within the Royal College of Psychiatrists.7.i.gPsychiatric nurses engaged in treating adolescents have to oe carefully selected and appropriately trained.   Their numbers will also need to beincreased; and in this respect the recent production by the Joint Board ofClinical Nursing Studies of outline curricula for training for nurses in thefield of adolescent psychiatry is welcomed and it is hoped that this will give an impetus to the establishment of courses in this field.7*2*? The residential s^aff responsible for looking after disturbed adolescentsin community homes often fact intense pressure in the ordinary course of their work, and support and opportunities for further training are essential.7.30 The training needs of these groups cannot be looked at in isolation,and ways will need to be developed in which the experience gained in different services can be made more widely available.Presentation of services.J5-i Services will need to be presented and publicised in such a way as to combat the very real problems of recognition of need and reluctance to accepthelp, to which attention is drawn above.
CHAPTER   8ALCOHOL AND DRUG DEPENDENCE AND MISUSE8.1   Dependence is a complex medico-social problem though not of itself amental illness or strictly a mental disorder.   Psychiatrists however havetaken the lead not only in treating the psychiatric and personality problemsoften found to accompany dependence, but also in exploring approaches to thetreatment of the dependence itself.8.2  Alcoholism and drug abuse present problems which run wider than, anddiffer in several important   respects from, those presented by mental illness.   The scope for prevention is broader.   One may attempt to influence the availability of^and the attitudes of society to, the &quot;agent&quot;, be it drugsor alcohol, as well as tackling the problems of the individual and thestresses placed upon him by his environment.   Physical medicine and thegeneral hospital services have a part to play in the treatment of physicalcomplications - liver disease , overdoses, withdrawal symptoms, malnutrition.Lastly the development of services both for alcoholics and addicts is at a far more rudimentary stage than that of the psychiatric services generally.Most services are in some sense experimental.   The special treatment unitsneeded to explore new approaches and provide a focus for training staff inthe problems of alcohol dependence are still being built up.   community services are provided to a far greater extent than for the mentally illby voluntary effort.
ALCOHOLISM8.3   Alcoholism is recognised as a growing problem.   It is a disease with both physic.il and psychiatric aspects and a major social problem with wideranging effects on families and society at large, as well as on thfalcoholic himseli&apos;.    It is thus&apos; the concern of an exceptionally wide range of professional workers; general practitioners, general physicians,psycuiatrists, nurses, health visitors, clinical psychologists and social workers, probation officers, the police and these in the prison service.It seems to be generally accepted that the treatment of alcohol dependenceitself, and of its psychiatric concomitants, is most effective with a multi-disciplinary approach, the lead, particularly in a hospital setting,usually being taken by the psychiatrist.8.t   It is one of the characteristics of alcoholism that relapse is frequent:substantial changes may need to be made in the whole way of life of thealcoholic who must himself make a sustained effort to control his desire todrink.   Treatment alone, unless followed up over what may be a long period by suT3Dort of some kind may have little lasting effect.   Alcoholism is pre-anaeminently a condition where a comprehensive medical/social approach, withan emphasis on continued care by a multi-disciplinary team serving a locality,is particularly appropriate.   Services have still a very long way to move to achieve this objective ana there are still many questions to be answered.
Prevalence8.5   Different surveys indicate that about 400,000 persons in England andWales (about 11 in every 1,000 of the adult population) have a seriousdrink problem.   most are male.   Estimates vary of the number who have reached a late stage of alcoholism and of the number whose alcoholism has given riseto physical or psychiatric complications.   Substantial local differencesoccur in the prevalence of alcoholism, but a fairly conservative estimatesuggests that in a health district with a population of 250,000 there mightbe 2,000 persons with a serious drinking problem.   Not all of these, of course,would accept or benefit from treatment   . at any particular point in time.8.6   There is some evidence linking the prevalence of alcoholism positivelywith the total consumption of alcohol in a population.   Total consumptioncan in turn be related to the cost of alcohol.   This may be a particularlysignificant relationship as the price of some alcohol drinks has decreasedin relation to the price of other goods in recent years; the same years have seen a very sharp increase in the total consumption.
Prevention8.7   Problem drinking and alcoholism are increasing particularly among young people and women.   Much more effort needs to beput into finding effective preventive measures.    &quot;Primary&quot; healtheducation in the sense of disseminating information about theeffects of alcohol and creating sensible attitudes to its use is a far-reaching task but could, in due course, help to reduce the prevalence of problem drinking.   The effectiveness of the normalhealth education techniques in relation to drinking habits is,however, largely untested and it is inevitably an uphill task ina society where there are considerable environmental pressures onpeople to drink.    &quot;Secondary&quot; health education, directed towardsencouraging those whose drinking has become a problem to seek helpis perhaps more likely to show results in the short term, and somepilot work has already been undertaken by the Health EducationCouncil.   Other ways of identifying problem drinkers and alcoholicsat an earlier stage may be possible, for example in the context of enforcement of drink and driving legislation, or through industry.Treatment and rehabilitation8.3   The general practitioner can play a most important role in early diagnosis.    If a problem drinker is identified at an early stage there is often a good chance of his recovery, although even at a late stage treatment may be able to help him control hisdrinking.   Knowledge about local facilities for the treatment and support of alcoholics and their families needs to be widelydispersed among the members of   primary   health care teams, social workers, personnel officers in industry and others whose role maylead alcoholics or members of their families to turn to them for advice.   It is important too for hospital staff to recognise drinkingproblems among those inpatients or out-patients being treated fora physical condition or injury which could be associated withexcessive drinking.    The majority of identified alcoholics who   jare admitted to hospital for psychiatric treatment are treated in
the general psychiatric wards of mental illness hospitals or inpsychiatric departments in general hospitals.     A minority -estimated at 35$ - are admitted to special units.     In the mainthese special units treat their patients for their &apos;:&quot; -r &apos;  -alcohol rather than for psychiatric illness.     Treatment takes the form of group and individual therapy, drugs, aversion therapyor a combination of these, and the units tend not to acceptpatients with severe psychiatric complications.     These specialistunits were not developed to replace the facilities offered bythe existing psychiatric services or other forms of specialisttreatment, but so that they might serve as a local focus ofexpertise, training and research for all the services concernedwith alcoholics in their region.     Other hospitals are expectedto continue to offer psychiatric treatment, on an in-patient,out-patient or day-patient basis to alcoholics in the areas theyserve.In some areas where homeless, chronic alcoholics congregate and where the police are faced with large numbers of habitual drunkenoffenders some special facility may be needed to bring them into contact with treatment and support services.     The Department ofHealth and Social Security is seeking to set up a few experimentaldetoxification centres, as recommended by the report of the -working party on habitual drunken offenders.*     One objectivewill be to find out how effective such centres would be in getting habitual drunken offenders to seek or accept help;another to find out whether such centres, whose work has bothmedical and social work components, would be better provided as an integral part of a hospital service or as a communitybased service.     Consideration must also be given tohabitual drunken offenders in areas where a special detoxificationservice would not be justified.dependence onways of helpingHMSO   1971
8.i-G    The development of community services for alcoholics hasbeen largely on the initiative of voluntary organisations.Historically much of the impetus has come from groupsconcerned with the problems of the homeless offender whois also an alcoholic.     This background sometimes leads to differences in approach between those working primarily with alcoholics who have been offenders, and those whoseoriginal role was to provide aftercare for other&quot;alcoholics.     It has also meant that, to local authorities,community services for alcoholics may have been seen as ,lying somewhat outside the mainstreamof residential care.       The community services neededrange 1-        from those concerned with prevention and putting problem drinkers or alcoholics in touch withtreatment services or other sources of help, to counsellingfor the alcoholic and his family, residential care,day care and self-help groups such asAlcoholics Anonymous.     It is important that voluntary organisations in each of these fields work closely with each other and with the probation t social and medical servicesWhatever their special interests or approach, they should see themselves as forming part of a comprehensive localpattern of services for alcoholics.     Squally, localauthority social workers should recognise the needs ofalcoholics and their families, and should not, as sometimeshappens now, shrink from the attempt to help them, eitherpersonally or by referring them to other agencies.     Inthe past, with alcoholism treatment services only to be found ina- few centres, few social workers have had direct contact withthem but as more local services develop this should change.
8 H A very considerable expansion of community services for alcoholics is needed,        Despite local authorities&apos;current problems of resources a number are showing an interesteither in developing their own services for alcoholics or in helping voluntary bodies to do so.     The Department of Health and social Security&apos;s current scheme for the revenue and capitalfunding of hostels for alcoholics^ channels funds to voluntary bodies for establishing new hostels or expanding existing ones:a condition is that the local authority should approve the schemeand be prepared in the long run to ensure that it is financiallyviable.     The process of absorbing these hostels into the general pattern of the statutory and voluntary residential care services is however a slow one.*    Particularly with the current limitations on social services authorities expenditure, few hostels are finding it easy to persuade social services authorities to payreferred to thea for residential caremaintenance charges for clientsi especially clients withoutstrong local roots^Nevertheless the number of these voluntary hostels is growing andit is hoped that the Department of Health and Social Security&apos;s- grant scheme will produce some 100-120 new places a year duringthe remainder of the period 1973-1978 for which it was set up.Some financial help is also being given to voluntary bodiesproviding or wishing to set up information centres and also for&quot;shop fronts&quot;.* A hostel any need to draw its residents from several neighbouring localauthority areas; some authorities have been reluctant to sponsor newhostels which they see as attracting potentially difficult clients toa , n      their areas.8. t 3l    The future SheMIiy &quot;speaking, services for alcoholics are at presentill co-ordinated and patchy.     Prevention has been neglected,or left to precariously financed voluntary initiative.     Thereis still one region without a specialised hospital treatmentunit-    The extent to which the general psychiatric servicestreat alcoholics varies from place to place.     Some of the specialised units, besides being highly selective, have notdeveloped -     .       their role in co-ordinating services foralcoholics in their own area, and stimulating developmentselsewhere in their region.     Follow-up and support may be absent orinadequate where alcoholics are treated at a distance from their home, and even where they are treated locally, after carefacilities are sparse&apos; . j were it not for AlcoholicsAnonymous, this lack of facilities would be even more serious.
There are gaps in our knowledge of the existing services andtheir effectiveness:    more evaluation is needed of different methods and settings for treatment.     Although 2 out of 3 alcoholicsCcin be expected to show some benefit as a result of treatment, wecan still hope to improve the long-term results.8,1$ The task     . must be towards a far better co-ordinated network of services with earlieridentification of alcoholics and more effectivefollow-up services.     This calls not so much for the development of many more       specialised hospital services or community services -though these last need a great deal of development in some areas- as for a greater awareness of alcoholism and of the needs ofalcoholics among professional workers throughout the health and social services, and in fields such as probationand the penal system.     Training - especially in-service training,in which the staff of the specialised units can play an important part - should provide in every area a nucleus of staff with a. sufficientunderstanding and experience of the problems of alcoholism who can use their experience to support others - doctors, nurses or social workers - whose roles bring&apos;   them into contact with alcoholics.The extent of alcoholism and the evidence that the problem is growing would appear to justify the setting up ^of services for alcoholics in most districts and&apos; a realistic objective might.be for one of the consultant psychiatrists in each district to devote a part of his time specifically to alcoholism, with aremit to offer advice and support to community workers whether health,social services or voluntary, as well as treating alcoholic patients.To prepare some consultants to take this special interest in alcoholism,psychiatric registrars and senior registrars should have the opportunityto train in a specialised treatment unit and those wishing to specialisefurther should be encouraged to do so.   In medical education an awarenessof alcoholism in the undergraduate curriculum and further theoreticaland practical training as a postgraduate will help general practitionersin their role in the wider alcoholism treatment services.   other professions too, through their different trainingbodies, will have to consider the training implications of a morelocally based service.     The Joint Board of Clinical NursingStudies   has recently introduced a 3^-39 week course for trainednurses, covering drug dependence as well as alcoholism.     experience in the Alcohol Education Centre and in providing in-service training^    in many of the alcoholism treatment units has shown that a multi-professional approach can also be valuable.
8.1$*&quot;   The recent reorganisation of the NHS provides an opportunity toexamine alternative ways in which services could be provided.It seems sensible that under the new structure the Area health authority should be the focal point, both for collecting information about local alcoholism problems and. for determining a strategyappropriate to the area, while in each district every effort should be made to establish an effective service for the locality.Resources further afield may need to be used where there arespecial needs, such as - residential care for which thereis no substantial demand locally.     The machinery of the joint consultative committee has a crucialpart to play in ensuring thenecessary collaborative approach among all the local servicesinvolved with alcoholics and their families.     It seems clearthat voluntary services have a part to play for many years tocome:   Area Health Authorities, as well as local authorities,separately or jointly, need to accept a degree of responsibility, for their financial viability, and for the support their staffmay sometimes need.8.l5    The emphasis in provision should perhaps turn towards a morelocally based treatment service with much of the work&apos; donein the community or in an out-patient or day hospital setting,supplemented by in-patient facilities, whether these arespecialised or part of the local psychiatric service.     a problem for the long-term is that the specialised units are atpresent sited in mental illness hospitals- and as more locallybased psychiatric services are developed, it will be necessaryto think again about their role and location.     The precisepattern of service adopted could vary from district to district,depending on local circumstances and need.     Different ways heedto be found of increasing the effectiveness and skill with whichprimary health care teams, social workers and others, deal withthe drinking problems they encounter among their patients orclients.     An early objective would be to build up in a seriesof chosen areas a balanced complex of preventive treatment and rehabilitation services which would provide an opportunity to evaluate experimental patterns and new ideas.     There is a specialneed, too, to develop more effective services for those homelessalcoholics whose needs were studied in the Home Office report onthe habitual drunken offender.     These services * be theyresidential or day services - need to work closely with the
treatment service.-; as well as with the probation service, police and courts, and may also be able to co-operate with the staff of projects concerned primarily  with accommodation forthe homeless in reaching out to men who -are not yet ready toaoceot that they have a drinking problem and need help.&apos;8.lf?    At this time, when ideas are changing about the way in whichtreatment in community services should develop and Questions ofprevention are acquiring greater urgency, there is        .      needfor a recognised source of advice on alcoholism and services foralcoholics and problem drinkers.     An Advisory Committee onAlcoholism has therefore been appointed.     Initially its members will serve for  3 years, and during this experimental period. it is hoped that they will be able to review and advise on many of the questions canvassed in this Chapter.    They willalso be responsible - and this is also an.organisational experiment- for promoting the development of those services speciallyneeded by homeless alcoholics - a field where progress has been3 low.A special sub-group of the Committee has been set up to underta-kethis task.8.17   There is no reason why action should wait until this new Committeehas reported.   Much can be done during the next few years along thegeneral lines indicated in these paragraphs, and without any additional call on health service or local government resources.Some of the changes may involve redeployment rather than additions to existing services or manpower.   Experimental developments willcontinue for the present to be centrally financed in whole or inpart.   New patterns of provision may emerge and we should not yetdraw up a definitive policy for future services.
DRUG- ADDICTION AND MISUSEBackground8.1$     The prevention of drug misuse and the treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicts calls for close co-operation between health,education, social services and law enforcement authoritiesand the voluntary bodies working in this field.     Many of thoseaddicted to or misusing drugs are young people with a variety of problems and often a history of emotional deprivation,disturbance and separation in the family, and sometimesinstitutionalisation;   they may or may not see their drugmisuse as a problem.     Both licitly and illicitly obtained. drugs are misused in a wide variety of ways.    A contributory factorto certain types of misuse is the ready availability of certaindrugs either from illicit sources suoh as break- ins at pharmaciesor, especially in the case of barbiturates and other sedatives orhypnotics, through prescription.8.1*^    Many addictsmisuse several drugs depending on availability and fashion.The total number of misusers of drugs for which notificationis not mandatory is difficult to estimate.     Multiple drugmisuse among young people appears to be increasing and theuse of barbiturates gives cause for concern.     The currentnumber of active narcotic addicts is probably around 2,000and the trend, though not steep, is upwards.     The number ofnarcotic addicts in the United Kingdom known to the Home Officeto be receiving drugs was31 December 1971      1555 (238 therapeutic addicts)31 December 1972      1619 (201 &quot; &quot;   )31 December 1973      1818 (222 &quot; &quot;   )There is a small illicit market in heroin and methadone and mostof those notified have a history of drug taking over a two orthree year period:   The total number of narcotic addicts is
therefore likely to be greater than the number notified atany time.A pool of addicts on long term maintenance ,vho are unwilling to try to break their dependence on drugs has built up in the years since the present treatment system was introduced in 1968.At the end of 1973 h&amp;p of notified addicts were under 25 and75/? under 30: each year there have been fewer notifications of addicts in their teens.Prevention3ft   Drug misuse needs to be seen as part of the wider problem of society&apos;sovereignty-reliance on drink, cigarettes, and prescribed drugs, such assleeping pills or tranquilisers.   It differs, however, in that mostforms of misuse are illegal.   Besides law enforcement prevention can be attempted in a variety of ways, including health educationdirected towards the public&apos;s attitude to drug taking inandgeneral / health education in schools where it can best form part of a discussion programme on health issues and problemsof personal relationships.Not e,nough is yet known about the types ofhealth education most effective in this difficult area.     Anill advised approach, by feeding interest in drugs in the wrong way may actually encourage experimentation.     Very fewbecome dependent compared with the number who may experimentwith, drugs, and those who deal with the young need more skillin recognising the possible signs of regular drug misuse.More important in the long run than health education may bethethe availability of/advisory and therapeutic services discussed in Chapter 7 to help young people in those personality needsor inadequacies which usually underlie a continued and regular&apos; interest in drugs.     There is room, too, for indirect forms ofprevention, aimed at creating a range of enjoyable and emotionallysatisfying activities for young people and encouraging easierand stable relationships between adults,  including parents,and young people.*g,)A The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, which advises theHome Secretary and the Ministers concerned with health and education on all the problems to which the misuse of drugsgives rise has ! recently recommended the setting up of a
steering group of doctors to direct a campaign of educationaimed at persuading doctors to reduce their prescribing ofbarbiturates.     Members of the public would also be encouraged to rely less on psychotropic drugs in general, especiallyhypnotics.     A voluntary approach of this kind proved successful,a few years ago, with amphetamines.Treatment and RehabilitationThe treatment and rehabilitation of addicts is seen very much asa single process.     Treatment is regarded primarily as a clinicalresponsibility:    and the drug dependent person is regarded as having a medical problem which is probably best treated by aconsultant psychiatrist with a special interest in drug addiction.8.2J &apos;  Treatment for narcotic drug dependence is provided mostly in special treatment centres set up for this purpose:   these clinics have the subsidiary purposes of providing a licit and controlled supplyOf narcotic drugs for those addicts whose doctors consider they need them, and of acting as a means of, restricting-the extent&apos;ofthe illicit and uncontrolled market in these drugs./  general practitioners are not able to prescribe heroin or cocaine, andalthough they can prescribe methadone they are encouraged tosend addicts to the drug treatment centres or psychiatrichospitals for treatment.     There are fifteen out-patient treatment centres in London and twenty-one in the provinces.Treatment may take the form of withdrawal from drugs, or&quot;maintenance&quot; therapy where the objective is to stabilise theaddict and enable him to function normally in the community.The approach is usually multi-disciplinary and although mostaddicts are treated on an out-patient basis some need a periodof in-patient treatment or rehabilitation in a residential unit.Addicts dependent on narcotic drugs are mainly concentrated inthe London area where there is some recent evidence that the pressure on treatment facilities is growing:   the situation isunder review.     There are still some areas in the Home counties and provinces where there are drug problems but no special treatment services available.     The psychiatric services need to be developed in these areas to provide a local service andto relieve pressure on the London services.
CONFIDfcNiiMi.8.2*5-    Most non-narcotic misusers who find their way to the treatmentservices are treated through the general psychiatric services,either au out-patients or in-patients, alongside patients whohave other problems.     A few of the special treatment centreshold clinic sessions for the out-patient treatment of this group.     Out-patient treatment, however it is provided, meetswitn the problem that many drug misusers fail to keep appointmentsor to persist with treatment.     It may be that out-patient treatment is not seen by soft drugs misusers as offering themhelp with their real needs as they perceive them.     Analternative approach might be for a multi-disciplinary team towork in a community rather than a hospital setting, offering a service to drug misusers as a part of the local services for young people described in Chapter 7.     Older people with adrug misuse problem may be ready to accept treatment throughthe general psychiatric services.     A particular problem is thedrug misuser who is prone to take overdoses, sometimes, during periods of crisis, very frequently.     Accident and emergencydepartments in some central areas are very familiar with this type of patient, who usually discharges himself as soon as heis - resuscitated.     There is a need to find some way of helping these very disturbed and self-destructive young people;and it is hoped, with the help of voluntary bodies workingclosely with certain accident and emergency departments, tooffer a short-term residential unit where their needs couldbe assessed and. an attempt made to persuade thern to accept help.8.25    The social work member of a treatment centre is an essential part of the multi-disciplinary team and acts as its link withother members of the social work services and with voluntary services.     Many of those narcotic addicts, who attend thetreatment centres are leading reasonably stable lives, oftenliving with their families and in employment, but each centresees a number of disorganised addicts who need social workhelp with their emotional and family relationships, accommodation and education; or employment.     This group can be extremelydifficult to help;   the social worker needs to use his   knowledgeof young neople and of drug dependence to develop skills in working with them and in interpreting their needs to others.CONFIDENTIAL
At present it is exceptional for local authority social workers to be deeply involved with the problems of the multi-drugmisuser who is not in touch with the treatment services, though there are signs that social workers who encounter a drugs problem in the course of their work are beginning to use the support oftheir colleagues in the treatment centres with their special experience and skills.     It may be that this is the rightpattern, and that, as suggested above, broad spectrum services for young people may best be able to help provided that theycan call on the support of those with special experience ofdrug dependence.8.2.W   At present, few of the existing day or residential services foraddicts and drug misusers are provided by local authorities,though most voluntary organisations working in this field relyheavily on local authority financial support.     The voluntary services have so far developed in somewhat piecemeal fashion,though there is some movement towards co-ordination throughthe Standing Conference on Drug Abuse.     Social servicesdepartments, aware of the changing needs in their own areas,may find that, as in London, they need to combine to set up on support the facilities needed by a whole region of thecountry.     Local authority social workers and those in voluntaryagencies, could well work more closely together.
Planning services.2*7    Drug dependence is a difficult area for information gathering.The parts of the picture have to be drawn together from many different sources - the local hospitals, the experience of family practitioners and chemists, schools, the police, and voluntary bodies.     As with alcoholism, strategic planning andthe co-ordination of activities in this field is a role inwhich area health authorities, social service:; autnorities,and the joint, consultative committees which link them,  can play a vital part.     Trends in drug misuse change, and it isimportant that there should be a flexible ana local approach to the problem, so that a response can be made to needs as they arise.8.2f    as with alcoholism there seems a. clear need for in-service training for professionals working in this field, and a multi-disciplinary approach, in encouraging the sharing of experience between those working with addicts in differentsettings, has much to recommend it.
MEDICAL STAFFGeneral psychiatry9.1   As new patterns of treatment and care develop the demands on the timeof the psychiatrist will increase.   Much of his time will necessarily haveto continue to he devoted to in-patients /aas the pattern of service changeshe will have responsibility for patients in the psychiatric department atthe general hospital, as well as in the related &apos;division&apos; of the mental illness hospital/; in some cases he will also have consultant oversight ofthe elderly severely mentally infirm.   But there is a wide range of othercalls on his time.   There has for oxompj^- been a marked increase in thenumber of out-patient sessions, and a striking increase in the number of day-patients.   These trends are expected to continue as more facilities become available and such services become more accessible.   Also increasing aredomiciliary consultations, enabling the consultant to assess the needs ofthe patient against his home background.       Suchdomiciliary consultations, perhaps as part of  a crisis intervention service,can sometimes be of valuable help in enabling the patient to overcome hisproblems without disrupting his home; but they may necessitate intensivevisiting over the crisis period, and can make considerable demands on thetime of medical and other staff./see Appendix, paragraph chapter 9MANPOWER
S.% In addition to his clinical functions, the consultant psychiatristneeds to devote time to consultative andsupportive work for the social services, especially in day centres and residential accommodation.   He has to train and supervise junior medicalstaff.   He has also, as multi-disciplinary therapeutic teams develop, toplay an advisory and supportive role in relation to other members &quot;of theteam, and co-ordinate their different approaches to patients and theirproblems.   As leader of the therapeutic team he will also have a considerableadministrative role.9.3   There is   however increasing interest in whether somefunctions at present carried out by psychiatrists might not be undertaken,at least in part, by other professions.   For example,-; The psychiatricnurse has already been recognised as a full member of thetherapeutic team.   In some areas &quot;nurse therapists&quot; are undertaking highlyresponsible work, particularly in relation to the treatment of phobias.A Working Party has been considering the role of the psychologist in the health service and it may bethat in future the therapeutic component of thfcjift-ole j.n relation to the mentally ill will be much greater than at present.   There is also thepossibility that with local and ready access to psychiatric advice and tohelp from psychologists, social workers and nurses, more work with the mentally ill --   could be carried out by the primary care team.Targets9.**- Nevertheless even allowing for changes which may result from these developments, it remains clear that   more consultants will be needed infuture; it is intended to increase the numberof consultant   posts in men-Gal illness to vne extent .&quot;Uir&apos;t avi-ii-uwio_____. f.      The first step towards formulating a series of targetresources permit. r 0levels for medical staffing was taken in the context of guidance on ininiinumstandards for hospitals for the mentally ill issued in 1972.   authorities were asked to ensure that by the end of 1974 each hospital for the mentally ill had a level of medical staffing of at least one consultant per 220resident patients.   The aim was to bring the worst staffed hospitals up to
at least a minimum level.   At the last count in September 1973i this level had still not been reached in 26 hospitals.   As the new pattern of services develops,with its increased emphasis on day patient and out-patient care, and advice and support to other services, the level of medical staffing needs to be related to the population served rather than to the number of in-patients.   The presentnational average is one consultant to about 60,000 population but this concealswide variations in different parts of the countryj and as a first target Healthas resources permitAuthorities have been asked^to ensure that in each health district there is atleast one consultant to 60,000 population.   Again this is not seen as an optimumstandard.   The intention is rather to ensure that the benefits of consultantexpansion are felt first in those districts which are most under-staffed.   Whenthe ratio&apos; *&apos;of one consultant to 60,000 population has been reached the next objectivebe-&apos;-silvan interim target, as available resources of doctors and money permit, ofone consultant per 50,000 population, and the eventual aim is to reach a ratio of one consultant per *f0,000 population in all districts.   These targets coverall work with adults: ie they include consultants working in the field offorensic psychiatry and those with the special interests referred to in the nextparagraph.9.5 Some psychiatrists take a special interest in particular groups of patients.An increasing number of new posts for example are for psychiatrists with aspecial interest in the elderly.   Some patients may require intensive psychotherapyand there is a call for psychiatrists having special training in this field.Other psychiatrists have a special interest in addiction problems and it is likely that more posts of this sort will be required.   At present none of these special interests are formal psychiatric specialties.Forensic psychiatry9.k  Forensic psychiatry is a recognised psychiatric specialty, though apart fromthe special hospitals and the Institute of Psychiatry and its associated hospitals,there are at present only 10 consultant posts in the NHS.   These are jointappointments between the Home Office and regional health authorities.   The 8senior registrar posts which have been established provide some scope for consultantexpansion but a broader training base is needed.   The introduction of regionalsecurity units in the next few years will no doubt call for a sizeable   increasem numbers.   It is understood that the Royal College of Psychiatristsconsideringthe production of criteria against which individual training posts can be looked at.
Child psychiatry9.&quot;]   Child psychiatry is recognised as a separate psychiatric specialty.   Atpresent the national average ratio of consultant child psychiatrists to total population is one to about 250,000, but here again, numbers are far below, thoseneeded to meet demands.   As an initial target, it is; hoped to bring the ratio upto one consultant child psychiatrist per 5^,000 children, which is roughlyequivalent to one to 200,000 total population.   There is a wide variation in thelevel of staffing in different parts of the country and the intention is to concentrate first on those areas which are worst staffed.   The number of consultantchild psychiatrists needed in the longer term, and ways of increasing the numberavailable will be examined further in the consultation paper to be issued on childand adolescent psychiatric services and referred to in Chapter 7.Adolescent psychiatry9.%   Adolescent psychiatry is another area; in which there is a serious shortageof specialist staff.   The profession is at present debating what trainingrequirements are appropriate and whether there should be a recognised specialtyof adolescent psychiatry; and it would not be appropriate at this stage to formulate specific targets.   The manpower requirements will also be considered in the consultation paper.Training9.9 Reference has already been made to the need for better training of medicalstaff.   The direct object is better preparation of staff for their demandingrole, but a valuable spin-off is the aid to recruitment which comes fromproviding stimulating postgraduate medical education.   Young doctors are attractedto specialties with lively training.   This is a matter primarily for the RoyalCollege of Psychiatrists.   A Joint Committee of the Royal College of Psychiatristsand The Association of University Teachers of Psychiatry has begun to accredithospitals for training purposes, with the aim of ensuring that all trainingpolicies conform to acceptable standards.
The Joint Committee has also recently published its first report givingguidance on training programmes in psychiatry.   The recommendations of the report&quot;Psychiatrists in Training&quot;/calls   for more teaching staff and more rotationaltraining posts between teaching and non-teaching hospitals, to provide a goodcross-section of experience.   The Government stands ready to play its part withthe College in evolving a coherent training and manpower strategy for thespecialty.9.1 C Recent years have seen a welcome growth in academic departments of psychiatrywith a consequent increase in the teaching of psychiatry at undergraduate andpostgraduate level.   This development has helped to improve the standardof psychiatric training at all levels.9.11 There is considerable scope for improving both the identification and treatment of mental illness by general practitioners, and their skill inrecognising when specialist treatment is needed.   General practitioners alreadypractising, as well as newly qualifying graduates will need training for thisrole.   The arrangement whereby some consultant psychiatrists have regular sessionsin health centres and general practitioner group practices may itself lead to increased awareness.   The Royal College of General Practitioners recognises the need for vocational training for general practice to include a psychiatricelement in training programmes.   The setting up of local psychiatric services will greatly facilitate this.   The importance of psychiatry in undergraduatemedical education was stressed by the Royal Commission on Medical Education.It emphasises the need for all undergraduate   teaching hospitals to develop as quickly as possible a local psychiatric service integrated with related services in the community./ Brook, Peter (1973) British Journal of Psychiatry Special Publication No. 7
Nursing Staff9.12 At 30 September .,0,7-5 ^ere were in mental illness hospitals and unitsthe whole time equivalent of about 42,000 psychiatric nurses in post.This figure includes registered and enrolled nurses, student andpupil nurses and nursing assistants.   The number of psychiatric nurses hasincreased in recent years, and the increase is expected to continue.   two important factors are the raising of the school leaving age and theGovernment&apos;s acceptance of the recommendations of the Briggs Committee onNursing.   The raising of the school leaving age has shortened the gap betweenthe school leaving age and the minimum age of entry into nurse training, andis expected to bring in many of the school leavers who want to enter nursingbut who would otherwise go into other careers because of the waiting period..   The Briggs Committee have recommended that a period of psychiatric nursing should be included in allnurse training programmes and it is hoped that as more nurses see the scope and attraction of psychiatric nursing they will increasingly turn to this.District psychiatric nursing service9.13 Authorities were asked, in the guidance on minimum standards -issued in1972, to ensure by the end of 1974 a nurse staffing ratio of at least onenurse per 3 in-patients in all mental illness hospitals.   At the last countin September 1973 this standard remained to be met in only 8 hospitals.   but although we must continue to ensure an adequate levelof nurse staffing in the mental illness hospitals, the planning of psychiatricnursing services for the future will need to relate nurse staffing to thetotal needs of the population rather than to one particular type of facility.The district psychiatric nursing service in the new pattern will beallresponsible for meetingjthe psychiatric nursing needs of mentally ill people from the district - whether as in-patients, out-patients or day patients,and whether in local general hospitals or in the &quot;division&quot; of the mental hospital serving the district.   It will include community psychiatric nursingfor patients living at home and specialist nursing advice to primary careteams.   It will also include the psychiatric nursing of elderly severelymentally infirm patients - whether in the mental hospitals or in localhospitals.   As the pattern of services changes, so it will be necessary to
change the pattern of deployment of nursing staff within the district and it will be one of the responsibilities of local nursing management to decide how best to deploy staff between the different elements ofthe district service at any one point in time.Targets9J4-    la the light of present and expeeted future numbers ofpsychiatric nurses, the Department of Health and Social Security isaiming at an initial target in each health district of a level ofpsychiatric nurse staffing of 85 nurses per 100,000 population,increasing gradually as resources permit to 100 nufses per 100,000 population.85 nurses per 100,000 but they are not evenly distributed.   Therehas not yet been enough experience of the working of the proposedpattern of services for the mentally ill and units for the elderlyseverely mentally infirm to issue more detailed guidance on nursestaffing levels at this stage.   In addition nurses will be needed to staff the psychiatric services for children and adolescents, as wellas other special units such as the regional security units.9.15    At present the proportion of qualified to unqualifiednurses is 55*45 and is thought to be too low,   A provisional aimis to move towards a position in which, nationally, some 60 of psychiatric nursing staff, excluding teaching and administrative staff, are qualified, and within this total of qualified staff,the proportion of registered to enrolled nurses is of the order of2:1.   It will clearly take some time to achieve this balance.The present national average is about
9.1k Psychiatric nurse training is at present undertaken almost entirely in the mental illness hospitals, although in practice nurses are increasinglyworking in local services which have a very different pattern of treatment and care.   While the form of nurse training is mainly the responsibility ofthe General Nursing Council, the Government recognises the need for training to take place in general and community hospitals as well as in the mental illness hospitals, and welcomes the introduction of rotational schemeswhereby students and pupil nurses spend part of their training period in amental illness hospital and part in a general hospital psychiatric unit.Social services staff and their training9.17 It is not possible to isolate and hence to quantify social work staffingneeds for the mentally ill.   The staff involved include field social workers,residential staff and staff employed in day centres.   Most of them areconcerned not only with the care of mentally ill people but with the promotion of mental health in a wider sense and it is difficult to quantifythe amount of time spent exclusively with the mentally ill as such.9.&apos;3 The body responsiblefor social services training is the Central Council for Education and Trainingin Social Work; and several recent developments in their thinking have special significance in relation to work with the mentally ill.   The council have adopted proposals for the integration of training for field social work with training for day and residential care, and for the development of anew type of national training in addition to that leading to the certificate of Qualification in Social Work (which has, up to now, been largely confined to field social work).   Both forms of training will in future cover the whole range of work in the social services.9.1^ The Council recognise that while elements of training common to allsectors of the social services are needed there must also be provision for specific training in the needs and problems of particular groups such as the mentally ill.   The Council have adopted the recommendation of their Working
Party on Training for Social Work with Handicapped People (a term which forthis purpose includes the mentally ill) that in addition to general trainingon the problems shared by all handicapped people there is a requirement todevelop further and advanced training courses on the needs of particular groups such as mentally ill people and those suffering from severepersonality disorders.9.20 It is important that in each local authority social services departmentthere should he senior staff who have had further specialist training in the specific needs of the mentally ill and can bring this experience to hear, bothin giving specialist help and advice to the social work area teams, and inparticipating in the planning and development of services for the mentally ill.   Some of the social workers who are working in the health service havealready had such further training and full use should be made of their special experience*  Particular account will have to be taken of training for social workers assigned to statutory duties in relation to the Mental Health Act.These duties^often involve making decisions in emergencies.   As a minimumstaff sd.ll  continuing in service training to give them confidence and skill to handle emergency cases when compulsory admission to hospital may be necessary.9*2) These proposals for training will make heavy demands en resources, bothof the social services themselves and of the training system.   This is aparticular problem in the context of the present economic situation, as aresult of which the Government has for the time being had to ask localauthorities not to increase the level of their total manpower establishments.It is therefore all the more important that authorities should do their best to provide training for existing staff so that they can be used to their fullpotential.   The Department of Health and Social Security is well aware of thedifficulties formed by these conflicting pressures, and has formed a working party, drawn from the other central government departments involved, thelocal authorities&apos; associations, the Central Council for Education andTraining in Social Work, the Personal Social Services Council and the professional organisations, to consider the whole question of the future needs for trained manpower in the social services in the light of the resources available.Psychologists9.2A Clinical psychology is one of the newer health service professions andhas undergone very rapid development in recent years.   At one time the mainconcern of psychologists in the health services was with relatively routineforms of psychological measurement such as intelligence testing, providingin effect an ancillary service to psychiatrists and other medical staff.   more recently psychologists have developed a very wide range of assessment
techniques which can play an important part in the choice and evaluation oftreatment.   They have developed a number of new forms of treatment based onpsychological principles, including various forms of behayiour therapy, whichare of particular value in the treatment of the mentally handicapped and thosesuffering from phobic conditions.In addition to their developing therapeutic role, the work of clinicalpsychologists is characterised by its emphasis on a teaching approach andby the application of research techniques in assessing the effectiveness oftreatment and rehabiliftiion programmes.9.23- &quot; &apos; &apos; &apos;?he number of clinicalpsychologists in post at 30 September 1973 was 553^-   Of these about 400/were based in mental illness hospitals and units, but in addition psychologistsbased elsewhere - for example in Departments of Psychology in general hospitals - probably devoted a significant amount of time to the mentally ill.   There is no doubt that in principle the contribution of psychologistsin this field justifies a substantial increase in their numbers.   The roleand organisation of the profession have recently been reviewed by a working party whose recommendations are expected shortly.   In the light of these recommendations the Government will be considering how the development ofpsychology services in the whole range of health service specialties,including mental illness, can best be assisted as resources permit, and will beexamining the manpower implications.9.2:*f0ne aspect of this development may well be to reinforce the tendencyalready apparent for the profession to acquire a more independent statuswithin the health services, with Departments of Psychology increasinglytaking       responsibility for managing their own services.   But at the sametime it is essential in    field, such as mental illness that the psychologistshould work as a full member of the therapeutic team and that his work should he fully discussed and agreed with the other members of the team.This should not, of course, inhibit contact between psychologists and the primary care team, or between psychologists and social services staff,&apos;./whole time equivalent
9,2$ $hen emotional and behavioural difficulties arise in schools and[hen special education needs are assessed, the contribution of educational psychologists and of school psychological services isimportant.   Their support for teachers and pupils in special schools forthe maladjusted and for those working with emotionally disturbed childrenfill also help in the general field of mental health.   Co-operationbetween psychological services for children developed by the area health authority and between psychological services developed by the localeducation authority is essential to ensure that the contribution ofeach is used to the best advantage.Psjchothfra^l^ts9.2k  At present the National Health Service does not have sufficientstaff to provide specialised psychotherapy for all patients who might beconsidered to benefit from this form of treatment.   Because of the amountof time required, psychiatrists who have had special training in this field can provide services for only a limited number of patients, andeven with the prospective increase in the number of psychiatrists, thereis unlikely to be any substantial increase in the amount of specialisedpsychotherapy psychiatrists are able to offer.   The Department of health and Social Security accordingly has proposed that there should be a review of the long-term priorities for the development of psychotherapywithin the National Health Service, having regard to other mentalhealth priorities and the resources likely to be available.   One of thematters which will no doubt be considered in this review is the scope for employment within the health service of suitably trained psychotherapistswithout medical qualifications.   In the meantime it has to be acknowledgedthat some groups such as those suffering from severe forms of phobia maytie particularly vulnerable to this staff shortage.Occupational therapists9.27  Involvement in creative and constructive work, and regular assessment of progress, is an important part of treatment and rehabilitation prog-rammes.   At 30 September 1973 there were 542 occupational therapistsemployeed in mental illness hospitals and units, and 932 unqualifiedstaff.   The numbers of occupational therapy staff in such hospitals and units have been increasing in recent years and it is hopedthat this trend will continue.     It will be important to make the
most efficient use of qualified staff by employing aides working under the supervision of qualified therapists and a training course for aides has beenestablished by the British Association of Occupational Therapists.   The useof volunteers and paid staff in fields such as art, music and drama, working under the guidance of occupational therapists or the specialist therapeuticteam, is also to be encouraged.Domestic staff9.1?The Department of Health and Social Security issued guidance to health authorities in 1972 on   a  minimum standard of domestic staffing.   at 10  September 1973 36 hospitals accounting for nearly one third of all mental illness beds occupied were still below this standard.   The achievement of areasonable level of domestic staffing in all mental illness hospitalsas noon as practicable   is essential to relieving nurses of basic cleaning dutiesso that their skills can b3 applied to the treatment and care of patients.
CHAPTER 10RESEARCH AND EVALUATIONThe importance of research10.1 In recent years there has been extensive research in Britain and overseas into both the fundamental nature of mental illness and various aspects of the needs of mentally ill people.   The Medical Research council has given much attention to this field and the contribution of the Counciland its various specialised units to knowledge about mental illness hasbeen substantial.   The Department of Health and Social Security has alsosupported a continuing programme of research on mental illness.10.2 Research is vital to the further development of the Government&apos;spolicies.   The body of existing knowledge about the needs of the mentally ill is, of course, very substantial and the policies put forward in this white Paper reflect a large measure of agreement (as well as someinevitable disagreement) about them.   We owe much of this knowledge to research already carried out.   But equally the foregoing chapters havemade clear that there are serious gaps in what is known.   On many issuesonly a tentative view can yet he formed.   The ideas underlying the newpattern of services are not in themselves novel, but the development ofthese services has so far been uneven and patchy, and there has been no real experience as yet of the way in which they all work together as a comprehensive whole.   Systematic research and evaluation are essential to assess their effectiveness in helping the mentally ill and to ensure thatshort-comings are identified and rectified.10.3 Research concerned directly with the operation of services cannot bedivorced from the more fundamental study of the nature of mental illnessand its response to different treatment approaches.   In the longer termour thinking about the kinds of service required is bound to be affectedby new knowledge and scientific advance.   The pattern of services proposedin this White Paper provides a broad flexible framework within which thereis ample scope for change and development.
Management and research10.4 The Government&apos;s concern in sponsoring research is to improve thequality of care and the effectiveness of treatment.   The achievement ofthis aim requires a degree of strategic direction to ensure that sufficient priority is given to the key areas in which issues of policy must he settled.   The organisation of research on these lines presentsproblems which are by no means confined to the field of mental health.There is now a general recognition that in many areas of Government-sponsored research insufficient attention has been given to planning andthe formulation of objectives.   Proposals for reorganising the management of research and development were set up by the previous Government in theWhite Paper 1 Framework for Government Research and Development&apos;(Cmnd 5046) published in July 1972.   These proposals are now being implemented and, within the Department of Health and Social Security, anew advisory machinery has been established under the direction of theChief Scientist with responsibility for promoting a dialogue between theDepartment, Universities and other research establishments.   At the sametime a comprehensive review has started, and will be continuing, of the overall shape of the research programme sponsored by the Department inmental illness as in other fields, and of its relationship to     the workof the Research Councils.10.5 New machinery has also been established within the organisation ofthe Medical Research Council which provides for the collaboration of theCouncil and the DHSS in the constant review and support of bio-rchemicalresearch over the whole field.   Under these arrangements the Department ofHealth and Social Security will fund bio-medical research related to their objectives, the research being organised and managed by the Council within their wider programme.   Both the Council and the Department recognise theimportance of research in the field of mental health.Priorities for research concerned with services10.6 Some provisional views have already been formed about the prioritiesfor research in the immediate future, and the Government has invitedlib
potential research contractors to pay particular attention to these areas.At the same time independent initiatives or new ideas coming from researchworkers in the field will continue to be encouraged; and the Department ofHealth and Social Security will continue to consider individual proposalsfor support,10.7    One of the important gaps in present knowledge is asatisfactory measurement and classification of the disabilitycaused by mental illness.   Present studies suffer from the lackof common definition of the various degrees of disability.   Itis difficult at present to assess in any scientific way the overall impact of mental illness on people&apos;s lives, and in turn the extent and kind of services needed,10,8    The other priority areas which have been identified are mainly concerned with particular types of service, or servicesneeded by particular groups of people.   Amont these is the&quot;new long-stay&quot; group diseussed in Chapter 4;   and proposalsfor further study are being .considered at present.   Squally,experiment is needed into new approaches to the care of the &quot;old9long-stay to find ways of countering the danger of institutions,-lisation.   Another priority area for research relates to mentalinfirmity associated with old age.   It is important to identify the nature and degree of mental infirmity which is beyond thescope of residential care and warrants hospital provision.Fur ther subjects for research are the implications for services of the increase in mental infirmity among the elderly as national longevity increases, ways of refiningassessment procedures and studies into current and alternativepatterns of care.     Research is needed in relation to mentally-ill people eared for at home by their relatives - in particular,
the kind of support and advice which relatives ought to have available,,Work is also needed to identify the number of offenders and otherpatients requiring treatment under conditions of security.10.9     In relation to particular types of sex-vice, the most seriousgaps in present knowledge concern residential and day care services inthe community.   There has already been some research on the extentof need for residential and day care services and this is reflected in the guideline planning figures in Chapter 4.    The background against which these services have to function is, however, changing andas these services expand it is important that they should he systematical]evaluated and different approachesffor example units of different size,alternative patterns of staffing, compared.   The SociologicalResearch Branch of the Housing Development Directorate at theDepartment of the Environment, who are engaged on a long-term study of the housing needs of handicapped people, are extending their investigations to examine also the housing needs of people who havebeen discharged from psychiatric hospitals.   This study is being undertaken under the joint sponsorship of the Department of Health and social Security and the Department of the Environment,10.10   It has been emphasised throughout this White Paper that thetreatment and care of the mentally ill involves the members of a numberof different professions working closely together.    They are highly skilled and trained staff and the way in which they are deployed is animportant factor in making effective use of resources.    Study is neededof the success of different working arrangements in a variety of settingsA further hut related need is for research on the success of different forms of treatment, for example specialist psychotherapy as againstphysical treatment.Worcester Development Project10.11   The Department of Health and Social Security hassponsored the Worcester Development Project to test and evaluate
a local pattern of services of the kind envisaged in this White Paper.The Project relates to the Worcester and Kidderminster Health districts and entails the development of a local network of health and social services in each district, and includes general hospital psychiatricdepartments, day hospitals, community psychiatric services, and localauthority residential, day care and social work support services. services for the elderly severely mentally infirm are also to be provided, togetherwith improved residential and day services for the elderly.10.12  When all these services are functioning as a whole, they areexpected to replace the services at present provided by Powick Hospitalfor patients newly arising,    0116 of the aims of the project is to contysider how the problems of transition from a service based on a largemental illness hospital oan be identified and resolved.   The project is acooperative exercise between the Department of Health and Social Security,the West Midlands Regional Health Authority,&apos; the Hereford and WorcesterArea Health Authority, and the Hereford and Worcester County Council.10.13  Several of the building elements of the project are already under construehonand it is hoped that a number of the main units will come into opera-tion in 1977.10.14  Evaluation of the newly developing services in Worcester andKidderminster is an Integral part of the project, -Southampton project10.15  Reference has already been made ; to an experiment in the care of &apos;new&apos; long-stay patients at Southampton.   This is part ofa major research project supported by the Department of Health and social Security       to       compare the operation of a district servicebased on a district general hospital psychiatric unit with one based on a&quot;division^of a mental hospital./ See Appendix, paragraph 3
CHAPTER 11PROGRESS TOWARDS THE MEW service the backlog of present deficiencies11.1   The Government is well aware that the pattern of services described in thepreceding chapters is a far cry from that which exists today.   While there arealready in beingseveral general hospital units&apos;,&quot; probably^only about half are of adequate size or-voffer standards of facilities for both day and in-patients capable of providing&apos; the focus of a full district service.   The development of local services for thelong-term care of the elderly severely mentally infirm has barely started andthe elderly mentally infirm are accommodated by individual local authorities ina variety of ways, some of which are less satisfactory than others.   Despite thesignificant improvements which have taken place over the last few years a numberof the mental hospitals are still considerably overcrowded; and although a gooddeal of upgrading has been carried out many of the buildings are increasinglyunsuitable for the accommodation of their ageing in-patient population.   Returnsfor 1973 show in general an improvement on 1972 but a number of hospitals are stillbelow one or more of the minimum standards for staff and amenities set by theDepartment of Health and Social Security in 1972:   standards which are themselvesonly tolerable minima.11.2   Individual local authorities are developing a wider range of day and residential services for the mentally ill, but some still have no facilities atall; and nationally the total level of provision falls far short of the guidelinefigures.   Moreover the general pressure on the social services is very heavy.Social workers in local authority social service departments often have to carryvery heavy caseloads and find they are often able to do little more than cope with emergencies and crisis situations.    In these situations the more specificstatutory duties - for example under the Children and Young Persons Act -inevitably in practice take priority over longer term preventive and supportivework.11.3   The Government recognises that services have also been severely affected,not only by restraints on the financial resources available,but also by fundamental organisational changes in the health and social services: by NHSand local government reorganisation; by the reorganisation of the social, servicesfollowing the Seebohm Report; by the transfer of hospital social workers to localauthorities      and        by new additional legal responsibilities, such as thosearising under the Chronically Sick and Disabled Personi Act.
11A   Multi-professional teamwork, adequate assessment, consultation and arrange-nents for after-car e^^social work support are as yet sadly all too oftentheoretical ideals which bear scant relation to the practical realities.Inevitably patients and their families do not always receive the standard of care and support they should^  ,11.5   The Government is moreover aware that- both staff andpatients and their families have felt that central authorities had not onlyfailed to appreciate the pressures under which the services are &apos; operatingbut were actively encouraging a precipitate rundown of the mental hospitalsas a matter of policy? and that closures would be implemented ruthlessly leavinglittle or nothing in their place.   We welcome this opportunity to stress thatour aim is not the closure or rundown of the mental illness hospitals as such;but rather to replace them with a local and better range of facilities.It will not normally be possible for a mental hospital tobe closed until the full range of facilities described in Chapter k has been providedthroughout its catchment area and has shown itself capable of providing for newlyarising patients a comprehensive service independent of the mental hospital.Moreover, even then, it will not be possible to closeT6 ^Sira^l^fc is no longer required for the long stay patients admitted to its care before the local servicescame into operation.Public sector costs of introducing the new service11.6 The -gulf between the existing service and the pattern of service advocatedmay be wide: but it is right in the White Paper that we should at least have a reasonably clear picture ofthe kind of service at which we are aiming even if it has to he. accepted that progress in the next few years may he slow and thatin some parts of the countryin particular, it will he many years before this pattern of services can berealised in practice.11.7  The new pattern will involve a radical change in the balance between hospital and community care inasmuch as it envisages a substantial decrease in in-patientservices and a substantial increase in day hospital and out-patient treatment,and in day and residential care within the community.   The implications for public sector costs have been the subject of an operational research study -commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Security.   An importantconclusion is that the running costs, taking health and social services together,are estimated to be much the same whatever the pace of introducing the new... -        runningpattern.National Healthservide   .       casts are expected to rise very slightly overthe first 10 years or so and then decline, offsetting the increase in social services running costs.
11.8   Two separate elements of capital investment are involved.   One is investmenton the new pattern of services.   The other  is the cost of upgrading the mentalbr.ppit*rtP.Most    of those that will have more than a short or medium term life willrequire expensive upgrading.   The cost of upgrading is thus dependent on the pace of introducing the new pattern.   The total national capital investment would amount to a programme of around  30m per annum on health services and  10m perannum on social services over a 20-30 year period.Translating philsophy into action the difficulties11.9lt is as wel&apos; frank about the difficulties.      Financial resourceconstraints alone, quite apart from the physical and manpower constraints, mean that it will inevitably be a very long time before a broadly comprehensivemodern service can be achieved in every district in the country       r,na thereare bound to be new developments and ideas in a time dimension of this kind.11.10 But there is perhaps an even more fundamental difficulty.   In the last resort achievement will be dependent on the community&apos;s willingness to accept anincreased responsibility for those of its members who are or have been mentally ill.Public attitudes have changed in recent years and are still changing; and may nodoubt be reasonably expected to become more tolerant as the development of local services brings about a better realisation of what mental illness is and howthose suffering from it can best be helped.Time is needed to prepare the way and to accustomthe community to tne-e added responsibilities. The very length of the time scalemay help in this respect.11.11 We must face the fact that the pattern we are advocating entails at least in part a transfer of responsibility to the social services   an(j &amp;n increasein resources for this purpose.
11.12We cannot look at the resource requirements of the mentally ill in isolation, whatever priority they are accorded.   We have to look at the totality of the financial and manpower resources likely to be availablefor the health and social services, and at the competing demands on these resources as a whole.   There is moreover the conflict which sometimes arisesbetween national and local priorities.   In individual local situations the priorities may be very different from those seen at national level.\How this is to be done is a big and difficult issue; and the likely constraintson public expenditure, particularly in the next few years, are such that hardquestions of priority have to be faced.
CONFIDENTIAL11.13   Yet another problem in the complexity of the planning involved.   the plans drawn up by the health authorities and local authorities for services for the mentally ill in each area must be joint plans.   The planning ofpsychiatric departments in general hospitals has to be par;: of the widerplanning not only of the hospitals themselves but of health servicedevelopments in general.   Discussion on which local services can be developedfirst are dependent on siting and other local practical considerations.   the timing has to take account of the physical condition of the existing mental hospitals; and the extent to which upgrading will be needed in these hospitalsif local replacement services are not provided at en early stage.   Planningmust also take account of the need for various regional and. area services.For example, regional security units and special units, for alcoholism, drugdependence and children.Resource planning assumptions11.14   A new system has been established within the Department of Health and social Security for reviewing each year over the whole field of health and social services the prospective developments in each sector and their financial and manpower resource implications.   These reviews are intended to help reach decisions on priorities over the following 10 years, and on objectives which are consistent with the best assumptions we can make about the total resources likelyto be available over the period.11.15   The first of these Departmental reviews is under way; and when completedshould enable provisional guidelines on priorities and objectives to be drawn tipfor consultation with NHS and local authorities.   So far as services for the mentally ill are concerned, the running costs, taking health and social servicestogether, seem unlikely to vary significantly within any likely pace of introducing the new pattern of community care.   Faced as we are with the prospectof very little room for development of the health and personal social servicesfourover the next fchrf&quot; or- A     years except by making better use of existing resourcesit would be unrealistic to expect any substantial increase,in this initial period,in the scale of capital investment.   But on the assumption that there will be a modest growth in real terms in the amounts available for the health and personal social services after that, and bearing in mind that for services for the mentally ill only a very slight rise in running costs as a whole is entailed, it seems reasonable to assume that it may then be possible to provide for the necessarycapital investment on the scale envisaged in paragraph 11.8.Joint health and local authority planning11.1^ Joint planning of health and local authority services is essentialw CONFIDENTIAL
for such services.The fact therefore that the planningk above will providesystem referred to in paragraph 11.14 above willnational guidelines for health and local authority services which are basedrelevant.   The national guidelines will need to be translated into individualregional and area guidelines (including resource assumptions); and it will bea high priority task for area health authorities and local authorities toproduce joint plans for the development of services for the mentally ill onthe basis of these assumptions.   The medium for joint planning in each area will be the Joint Consultative Committee which both authorities have been required by the WHS Reorganisation Act to establish for purposes such as this.11.1&quot;?  These joint plans will form part of the plans produced for thedevelopment of health and personal social services generally.   For theNational Health Service these will be of two kinds; strategic plans examiningand setting out the realistic prospects of developing services in the next ten years and annual plans detailing the action proposed to implement thesestrategies and priorities in the next three years.   There will be a regularprocess of reviewing these plans and updating them in the light of progressachieved.   They will need, among other things, to identify which mental illness hospitals are likely to have a relatively short life, which are likelyto reduce their scale of services and which are likely to have a continuingmajor role beyond ten years.   It is proposed that a similar planning processshould be followed for the personal social services; the results of joint planning of services for the mentally ill will thus be reflected consistentlyand in parallel in local authority as well as NHS plans.   (Discussion aboutlocal authority planning on this basis will be pursued with the local authority. would beassociations.)   The aim/   for the initial plans from both sets of authoritiesto be ready by the end of 1976 so that it would be possible to extracts from them a national picture of planned development of services for the mentally ill and publish it in an appropriate form during     1977*11.1$ There will be many considerations to be borne in mind. Psychiatricunits in general hospitals often have to form part of a wider development andthere may well be little room for manoeuvre in the timing of their provision.Local authorities will need to understand this, and to plan to give particularpriority to providing support ingsocial services in those parts of their areas where such units are coming into operation at an early date. Conversely health authorities must appreciate that a general hospital psychiatric unit cannot functionon realisticresource assumptions makes it particularly
efficiently in isolation; it can only function properly as part of a whole network of local services, of which social services residential, day care and domiciliarysupport are essential elements.   Lack of such services might mean, for example,that the day hospital facilities in the psychiatric unit cannot be fully usedbecause patients have not got a sufficiently supportive home environment to returnto at night, and as a result patients in the unit might have to remain as in-patients for longer periods than is necessary on medical and nursing grounds.11,19   kseierllymp0rtant faCtor is the timinS of loc^ provision of services forthe elderly/mentally infirm.   These will need to be provided in parallel with,if not ahead of, the general hospital psychiatric unit.   Failing this the staff at the mental hospital will be left to care for patients who make heavy demands on nursing staff, often in unsatisfactory physical conditions.   If such a situationis allowed to arise it will inevitably be damaging to morale and staff recruitment.legional strategies11.20  A further element of complexity is that the various Areaplans will often be    interdependent and the development of regional strategies isessential.   This is partly because some services overlap Areas; partly because it will be necessary to consider what plans should be made for patients needingcontinuing care when numbers in a mental hospital are reduced to the point atwhich the hospital becomes no longer viable; and partly because some services,for example, regional security units, are regional in nature.11.21   Throughout the whole planning process, health authorities will need to haverelatedparticular regard to the implications for the/mental hospitals of the developments of local services in each district.   This aspect of the planning and management of services is of fundamental importance, both to the successful introductionof new patterns of care and to the maintenance and improvement of standards at the mental hospitals themselves.   Because of the importance attached to this, aseparate Appendix has been included in which some of the problems of the transitional period are discussed in more detail.Staff involvement11.22   In formulating the joint area plans anc. in developing
the regional strategies, the staff of the mental hospitals and those in the developing local services should be kept fully in the picture.   Some of the moresenior officers will, of course, have an opportunity to contribute to the planning, through the medium of health care planning teams and in groups servicingthe Joint Consultative Committees, but it will be necessary to arrange meetings and seminars, so that all the staff representatives and indeed as many as possible of the staff themselves have a first hand opportunity to learn what is proposed and to ask questions.   Area Joint Staff Consultative Committees, or theirequivalents, and similar bodies at District, Sector or Unit as appropriate,willbe the channel for formal consultation with staff representatives as a body.Staff will be particularly concerned with arrangements for transfer between the mental hospital division1 and the developing local district services, theprotection of their various interests and with the timing of all proposed changes.
CONFIDENTIALAPPENDIXTHE MENTAL HOSPITAIS IN THE PERIOD OF TRANSITION TO THE NEWPATTERN OF service Some mental hospitals will continue in use for many-mayyears.   However, because the buildings/remain this does not mean that the pattern of service based on them need remain the same. One has only toconsider the pattern of care for which the hospitals were originally designed and the kind of service which they now provide to appreciate the possibilityof further far-reaching changes.   Moreover, the policies set out in this white paper   go much wider than the provision of buildings; improvements in staffinglevels and the introduction of new patterns of co-ordination and integrationwill also benefit those services which are based on mental hospitals.   Indeed itis essential that they should: it is in the mental hospitals that most patientswill in practice continue to receive specialist treatment for many years. Moreoverso lon^ as these hospitals form part of the district service, it is important that doctors and nurses should continue to receive part of their training in them.i We must ensure that theorganisation of the services of the mental hospitals is integrated with that 0fthe newly developing local facilities, and that the staff in the mental hospitals participate in the planning and development of these new facilities.2   Much has been written by the Hospital Advisory Service and by others aboutthe dangers during the transitional period of creating a two-tier service with   the general hospital unit providing a first class service limitedto selected patients who respond most readily to treatment, and the mental hospital      left as the place to which the less attractive types of patientscan be passed on. A two-tier system does, sadly,already exist within a number of mental illness hospitals themselves, in the admission wards on the one hand and the long stay wards on the other.    In eachsituation the service provided will ultimately dependpartly on operational policies and the deployment of resources  and partly on the attitude of individual members of staff to their work.   The Government&apos;s concern ts thatthe management and organisational arrangements should be such as to promotean integrated service.3   With this in mind Health Authorities have been asked to split the mental illness hospitals which serve more than one district into organisationalunits referred to as &quot;divisions&quot; each - representing       that part of the hospitalwhich serves a health district in the hospital&apos;s catchment area.
&quot;Wherever possible, the wards making up a 1 divsion&apos; should be in the samepart if the hospital. Each division should have its own consultant and nursing staff and be responsible for providing a service to its health district.   On average such a1 division&apos; might have, initially a total of some kOO or so beds and be served byteams.3 or *f consultant-led /    This organisational arrangement takes a step towardsgiving a local identity to the service and encouraging a sense of allegiance onthe part of the staff of the&apos;division&apos;towards their health district.k  Whether or not the 1 division&apos; should be further subdivided So that individual therapeutic teams are each responsible for their own geographicalsector of the district is something to be decided locally in the light of the characteristics of the individual district.     (See also paragraph 3.14).5   As the local district psychiatric facilities developthey should be integrated organisationally with the corresponding&apos;division&apos;atthe mental hospital so that, for example, there is joint medical and nursestaffing of the&apos;division1 and the new district facilities.,, Some ofthe nurses who hitherto have provided a service to the district from the mental hospital &apos;division&apos;, may be redeployed to help provide thedistrict service from the general hospital unit or community hospital.In this way it is hoped that staff will increasingly think of their responsibilities in terms of a district service which, wherever it is provided,whether from a mental hospital&apos;division\ a general hospital psychiatric unit,a community hospital, or in domiciliary and supportive work in the communityitself, is all part of the same district service.6   The District Management Team for each health district has responsibilityfor the formulation of policies for the development of services for its population.   It will therefore be concerned not only with the provision anddevelopment of psychiatric services locally but also with the operationalpolicies and standards of service of the relevant mental hospital &apos;division&apos;.
This has particularly important implications for the deployment of nursing staff,and the aim must be to move towards a position in which each district has adivisional nursing officer responsible for the whole range of psychiatric nursing services so that needs can be properly represented at the appropriate level of decision taking,.7.     In carrying out its work the District Management Team will usually have theadvice of a Health Care Planning Team for mental illness servicesincludesmembers of the staff based at the mental hospital &apos;division&apos;,and members of the staff in the develop!s  local services.    It will have animportant role in alerting the District Management Team to any imbalance of resources in different parts of the district service.8.     Community Health Councils are concerned with the provision of health services generally for their community.   The statutory duties of a Community Health Councilrelate to services within its district but it is important that the Council should look at the provision of mental illness services as a whole for each district,including the services provided by a hospital &quot;division&apos; from outside the district.There will therefore need tb be suitable arrangements between different community health Councils (and if necessary consultation with Area Health Authorities or their officers) to enable a Council to visit a hospital outside its own district and to comment to its own District Management Team on the services provided therefor its district.   The District Management Team will need to ensure that these comments are made known to those responsible for the management of the hospitalas a whole.&quot; It is important    that the policies for the different &apos;divisions&apos; of amental hospital should be co-ordinated.   Such co-ordination is the responsibilityof the Area Health Authority.   The Authority is also responsible for the developmentof operational policies for services common to all *divisions&apos; such as domestic and catering facilities.   On the basis of the co-ordinated policies responsibilityfor the day to day management of the hospital as a whole will have been delegated to an Area Team of Officers or one of the District Management Teams.10.   Plans for the development of local district facilities will need to heviewed in the light of their implications for the related wentillness hospitals. &quot; Some mental hospitals (or &apos;divisions&apos; within them) will by virtue of their location in relation to their catchment population, and perhaps
CONFIDENTIALalso their physical condition, be less able to make an effective contribution toa local district service than others;   and authorities in drawing up the jointplans referred to in Chapter U (paras 11.1^-11.1^) will need to concentrateinitially on the replacement of those hospitals (or &quot;divisions&apos;) whose physicalconditions and geographical location are likely to provide the greatest handicap.Within individual hospitals there may also be advantage from the point of viewof the hospital as a whole in phasing the introduction of general hospital units in the various districts served by it, so that at least one &apos;division1 continuesto provide an active admission service until the hospital is nearing the end ofits life.11.    Where it is clear that hospitals or individual &apos;divisions&apos; are not among those selected for early replacement, the health authorities concerned must carryout a realistic assessment of the way the existing facilities can best be used.Such studies will need to be carried out in conjunction with local authority andprimary care staff, the advice of the Health Care Planning Teams playing animportant role in overcoming problems of location in relation to individualdistricts.   It may, for example, be possible for health centre or local authorityaccommodation to be used as a base for community psychiatric nursing services:local authority social services departments maybe able to play a mor significant role in the management and staffing of those hospital wards whichaccommodate long-stay patients who would be living in the community were suitablefacilities available for them.   Alternatively there may on occasion be health service accommodation which can be made available to local authorities or voluntary organisations for use as a day centre or a residential unit for thesepatients.   Not least an attempt should be made to develop links between psychiatricservices and the general hospital services, if only by providing accommodation atthe general hospital from which a psychiatric consultation service can be offered to other departments at the hospital.12.    Maintaining the physical structure and improving standards of decoration,toilet and other facilities at the mental illness hospitals is essential if morale of i;he staff is to be maintained and the burden of nursing an increasingly ageingin-patient population to be eased.   An important by-product of a long-termstrategy for services for the mentally ill is the development of an upgrading plan in which the scale and type of upgrading needed in each hospital is assessed inthe light of the anticipated timing of development of replacement services in the districts it serves    and the resultant effect on the number and types of patientslikely to be resident in the mental hospital during the various phases of its life.This upgrading plan is needed to ensure that limited resources are spent at theright time and on those parts of the hospital which are expected to have the longest life.
13.   If the transitional period is to be acqepted by the mental hospitals as a challenge in the positive sense, they must be given an adequate share of manpower and other resources with which to meet it.   The management arrangements outlined above will provide a framework within which those responsible for local managementwill have every opportunity to deploy resources flexibly between the old and newparts of the service.   The Government will also be considering the need to give further guidance on minimum standards of staffing, food, clothing, space, personalamenities etc in the mental hospitals.1^&apos;,   31 should not be forgotten that it is the staff of the mental hospitals whohave been the pioneers of the last quarter century: they may well prove to be thepioneers of the next, providing they are given the resources and opportunity toparticipate in new developments, particularly in experiments and research intobetter ways of providing care and treatment in the context of a local service.Some of the problems identified elsewhere in this Command Paper as requiringfurther research could well be studied in the mental hospitals, Forexample, the mental hospitals have in particular developed a wealth of valuableexperience in caring for longer stay patients.   They should be encouraged, inconjunction with local authority social services departments, to use this experienceboth to develop new approaches to the rehabilitation of existing and ofteninstitutionalised long-stay patients, and to experiment in alternative forms of hospital care for newly arising long-stay patients.* Indeed in a number of areas the mental hospitals will continue to be the focalpoint for certain aspects of research for many years to come.
