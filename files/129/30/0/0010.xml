DRAFT OPENING SPEECH, 1948-49 SESSIONTuesday, 26th October, 1948my lords and members of the house of commons :1. The Session beginning to-day opens in a troubled world still sufferingfrom the ravages of war. To spend all our energies on repairing these ravageshas been our constant desire, but we have been hindered by distrust anddissension between the nations. Yet, with mutual confidence and goodwill, theproblems now facing us would not defy solution, and the peoples of the world would be able to live in peace and enjoy the fruits of their labours. Meanwhile,as the recent meeting in London of Prime Ministers and their representativeshas shown, the peoples of My Commonwealth offer an example of voluntary and useful co-operation.2. My Government will continue to work closely and harmoniously, withinthe framework of the Treaty of Brussels, with the other Governments whichare parties to it; to give full support to the United Nations, and to strive to fulfil the aims of world peace and well-being set forth in the Charter.3. In the Western Zones of Germany, economic revival has begun. Currencyreform has brought stability and renewed faith in the value of money. TheGermans themselves are working hard to design a democratic constitution for western Germany.In Berlin, however, a difficult situation^has arisen as a result of the actionof the Soviet Government in cutting eefvfo^1 communications between the city and Western Germany. My Government hold the view that this action constitutes a threat to peace and have therefore referred the matter to the Security Councilof the United Nations. Meanwhile, Berlin is being supplied by air; and aircraft from the United Kingdom, some of them flown by crews from other commonwealth countries, are combining with those of the United States to keep Berlin linked with Western Europe.4. The Queen and I look forward with pleasure to visiting Australia and NewZealand next year.
