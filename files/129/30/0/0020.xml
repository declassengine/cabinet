THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 19481-SECRET Copy No.CP. (48) 250. 11th Novemhsr, 1948-CABINETTHE WESTERN FRONTIERS OF GERMANY AND THE LIMITS OFTHE SAAR -Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsSummaryI set out below, for the consideration of my colleagues, proposals regarding(i) the territorial claims against Germany of the Benelux countries and Franceand (ii) the limits of the Saar. I also circulate, as an Annex to this memorandum,the Report of the Working Party, which, in accordance with Annex K of theReport of the Six-Power Conference on Germany (CP. (48) 143), has beenstudying the question of provisional adjustments to the Western Frontiers ofGermany and the question of the boundaries of the Saar territory.2. I ask my colleagues to approve the unanimous recommendations of theWorking Party contained in Parts II, III and VI of the annexed Report, subjectto the general observations in Part I, and to give me authority to enter into discussions with the other Governments concerned for the immediate entry intoforce of the minor rectifications proposed.A. BENELUX AND FRENCH FRONTIER CLAIMSSince the end of 1946 the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and luxembourg, in common with the Governments of other countries bordering upon&apos;  Germany, have advanced certain claims for territorial compensation againstGermany.  All three Governments submitted detailed memoranda to the Councilof Foreign Ministers.2. The French Government presented no memorandum but in a statement on 11th April, 1947, during the Moscow session of the Council of foreign ministers, the French Foreign Minister made it clear that in due course hisGovernment would have certain claims to put forward. He specifically mentionedFrench aspirations to the German inland port of Kehl, on the Rhine oppositeStrasbourg.3. In preparation for the Moscow session of the Council of Foreign ministers circulated and obtained my colleagues&apos; approval for a paper (O.R.C. (47) 7)defining the attitude which His Majesty&apos;s Government should adopt in regardto the claims put forward by the Benelux and other Governments.4. The policy then laid down was that His Majesty&apos;s Government, in viewof strong political reasons on the Western European as opposed to the Germanside, should give considerable support to the Benelux claims. This support,]however, was conditional upon some curtailment of the Netherlands claims andthe almost complete rejection of the Luxembourg claims.5. At the Moscow session of the Council of Foreign Ministers in Marchand April 1947 the question of frontier rectification was discussed, but only ingeneral terms. I proposed that all territorial questions should be referred tothe Deputies, who could set up the necessary Commissions, but my proposal36076 B
was not accepted since the Soviet Delegation refused to allow the Polish-german frontier to be discussed.6. At the London session of the Council of Foreign Ministers in November,1947, I again put forward a proposal for the establishment of a commissioner Commissions, but was again unable to secure unanimous approval.7. In the meantime, however, the Belgian and Netherlands claims had been examined on the ground by an Anglo-Belgian and Anglo-Dutch Commissionrespectively and much useful information was thus obtained, ,8. The Six-Power Talks on Germany opened in London on 23rd February,1948, and it -was known that the Benelux Governments wished their territorialclaims to be taken into consideration. The situation, however, had changedconsiderably in two important respects since I had obtained my colleagues&apos;approval for the policy defined in O.R.C. (47) 7.9. In the first place that policy presupposed a settlement of the question on a Four-Power basis. We were now considering a tripartite settlement. Tomake extensive frontier changes in the West without the participation of theSoviet Union would have given the Soviet Government an overwhelming propa-ganda advantage and have enabled them to turn German nationalist feelingstrongly against the Western Powers. The patriotic drum is the easiest andcheapest for any political party to beat, and the Communist Press in germany had already begun to work up a campaign.10. In the second place, before the Moscow session of the Council of foreign ministers I was hopeful of an early decision on the whole matter of frontiers.At that time immediate transfers of German territory might have been possible,By February, 1948, large scale changes were no longer possible. German produc-rtion had become an essential factor in our plans for European Recovery, and forthis we required full co-operation from the Germans. It was clear that eventhose political leaders who were most co-operative would lose their influence withthe Germans if they tried to condone large scale cessions of territory. It wasmoreover illogical to aim at the integration of the Western German economywith that of Western Europe while removing from Germany important elements of her economic potential.11. For these reasons I instructed the United Kingdom. Delegation to the six-Power Talks to oppose as far as possible the Benelux claims and to attemptto persuade the Benelux Delegations to drop their claims in return for satisfac-tion on other points, such as. a share in. the control of the Ruhr. The UnitedKingdom Delegation were at the most authorised to agree to minor rectificationswhich involved no appreciable loss to the German economy, and which couldbe defended on their own merits as eliminating local anomalies.12. The United States Delegation adopted a similar position, but the benelux Delegations, supported by the French, were reluctant to abandon anypart of their claims as they then stood. The United Kingdom and United StatesDelegations made it clear that the claims in their present form were unacceptable,but after considerable discussion, and partly in order to obtain Benelux approval for other parts of the London recommendations, a compromise formula wasreached.*13. This formula provided that a Working Party whose terms ofreference were contained in Annex K of the Report (see CP. (48) 143)should be set up to examine and report on Benelux and Frenchclaims for frontier adjustments which involved no appreciable loss to the german economy and which, being of a minor character only, could be regarded as desirable to eliminate local anomalies, and improve communications. It was made clear that the recommendations of the Working Party, if approved, should be confined to provisional adjustments which would be subject to confirmation or modification at the final settlement: nor was there any commitment Upon Govern-ments to support the adjustments at that time.14. The Working Party has now completed its task and its Report isattached as an annex to this memorandum. During the discussions, the UnitedKingdom Delegation, who adhered strictly to the terms of reference laid down,and who regarded themselves in a sense as the advocates for Germany (since mostof the claims affect the British Zone), frequently found themselves in a minority of one in opposing some of the claims put forward, even although these had
been considerably reduced in extent from those originally presented to the Councilof Foreign Ministers. In some cases the United States Delegation were able tosupport the attitude taken up by the United Kingdom Delegation, but in manycases they did not do so, and the United Kingdom Delegation were thus placedin the Unenviable position of having alone to oppose the claims of their Brussels(&quot; Treaty Allies. -   -15. As a result, the United Kingdom Delegation were able in many cases to persuade the claimant delegation either to abandon or modify their claims orto defer them while accepting a special arrangement which would not involve any frontier rectification. The unanimous recommendations on these special arrangements are contained in Part flEaf the annexed Report, and the actualrectifications which in many cases, after modification, have been unanimouslyrecommended are in Part II. These rectifications are all of a minor nature,and can be justified on one or more of the following grounds (a) that they facilitate customs and frontier control;(&amp;) that they improve communications;(c) that they will help to prevent flooding;(d) in a limited number of cases, that they eliminate a historical anomalywhereby a village is cut off from the town on which it is dependent.The total area concerned is no more than 128 square kilometres, and although a population of nearly 17,000 is involved, special provisions are made in Part I jto prevent indiscriminate expulsion.   I therefore ask my. colleagues to approve ,jthe recommendations in Parts II and III of the Report. i16. The United Kingdom Delegation were, however, unable to persuade the claimant delegations to abandon certain other claims. Part IV of the Reportcovers these claims, for which in the view of the United Kingdom Delegation thearguments in favour of rectification on the grounds of the elimination of localanomalies were not&apos;sufficiently strong.17. In spite of this I had instructed the United Kingdom Delegation tosupport certain of the Netherlands claims in the latter category provided thatthe Netherlands Delegation were able to agree, as a token gesture, to the elimination -tion of three anomalies by a minor rectification of the frontier in Germany&apos;s favour. This would have been of considerable value in justifying the proposedrectifications to German public opinion, but the Netherlands Delegation, after consulting their Government, were unable to agree to the transfer of any Dutchterritory, however insignificant, to Germany, and the United Kingdom Delegationtherefore maintained their opposition to the Netherlands claims shown in Part iv of the Report.18; Part V of the Report covers those claims which, in the opinion of theUnited Kingdom and United States Delegation, lay outside the terms of reference of the Working Party. The French and Benelux Delegations did not agree withthis opinion, but no recommendations are made on these claims.B.-THE SAAR19. Part VI of the Report deals with the boundaries of the Saar territory,and it is therefore convenient to recall briefly the history of this question,20. Since February, 1946, the French Government have demanded theeconomic integration of the Saar with France. On 18th July, 1946, however,-they fixed the boundaries of the Saar territory in such a way that it was increasedby 950 square kilometres over its size in 1919.21. At the Paris and Moscow sessions of the Council of Foreign ministers explained to the French Foreign Minister that His Majesty&apos;s Government could agree to the French demand for the economic integration of the Saar providedthat satisfactory agreement could be reached on the boundaries of the territory,and on its reparations value:   No decision, however, was reached.22. On 6th June, 1947, the French Government reduced the area of the saar by some 320 square kilometres from that resulting from their action in July,1946. At the same time, they introduced, with the approval of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, a special Saar mark. His Majesty V Government informed theFrench Government that they were prepared to accept these new boundariessubject to final agreement being reached upon them at the peace settlement, and36076 b 2
also subject to satisfactory agreement being reached with the French on the adjustment of the French reparations claim to take account of the value ofthe Saar.23.   Immediately prior to the London session of the Council of foreign ministers the French Government unilaterally completed the economic integration of the Saar by the introduction on 20th November, 1947, of the French franc&quot;!1into that territory.24. The question was barely discussed at the London session of the Councilof Foreign Ministers, but thereafter discussions were opened in Berlin between british, French and American experts cm the reparations value of the Saar andon two other outstanding questions, namely, the trade of the Saar and the alloca-tion of Saar coal.   Agreement was reached on 20th February, 1948.25. At the Six-Power Talks on Germany the question of - the boundaries of the Saar was included in the terms of reference of the Working Party onprovisional frontier adjustments at the suggestion of the United States Delega-tion, since the United States Government had not previously given its approval to the boundaries fixed by the French action of 6th June, 1947.26. The boundaries of the Saar territory which are now recommended bythe Working Party in Part VI of their report, and which I ask my colleagues to approve, are those fixed by the French action of 6th June, 1947,&apos; with threevery minor rectifications now proposed by the French Government.C. FUTURE ACTION27. In asking my colleagues to approve the recommendations contained in parts II, Illand VI of the annexed Report, subject to the general observationscontained in Part I, I also ask for authority to enter into discussions with theother Governments concerned for the immediate entry into force of therectifications proposed.28. Annex K of the Report of the Six-Power Conference on Germanyspecifies that any decisions reached as a result of the Working Party&apos;s recommen-dations should be provisionally implemented without delay. There are indica-tions that the Netherlands Government may propose that, while some of therectifications should be put into effect immediately, action on others, where theyhave not received full satisfaction, should be postponed.29. I should deprecate this proposal, since it is clear that the rectificationof the frontier by instalments could only have an unsettling effect in Germany.Moreover, while it is tempting in the present delicate international situation to defer action, I consider that even if all the claimant Governments could agreeto defer action on all their claims, which is unlikely, it would on balance be preferable to adhere to the London decision. It is important not to under-estimate the outburst of ill-feeling which the announcement of frontier changes will cause in Germany. British stock in Berlin is high, for obvious reasons,and in Western Germany there is appreciation of what we are doing for Berlin,hut the Military Governor points out that there is also grave dissatisfactionand uneasiness on a number of points, the chief of which is dismantling. when these frontier rectifications are announced we must therefore expect an outburst of German nationalist feeling of which the Russians will take full advantage.Nevertheless, the situation will be easier to handle now than later, when a western German Government may be in existence and may be able to make useof pressure such, for example, as a threat of resignation. Furthermore, as longas action is deferred, the Benelux Governments will seek to reverse the decisionsnow reached where these are not favourable to them, while the running soreof anxiety and resentment in Germany, where the claims are still envisaged in their original, exaggerated form, will continue to fester. It is desirable,from the point of view of our policy towards both Germany and Western Europe,that finality should be reached in the early future on this long outstandingquestion.30. I therefore propose, subject to the views of my colleagues, to suggest to the other Governments concerned that an early announcement should be made,and that after delimitation on the ground by the representatives in each caseof the claimant Government and of the occupation authorities concerned, therectifications should be made forthwith.
, 31. In order to lessen as much as possible the adverse effect on public opinion in Germany, I propose that, if possible, the actual announcement should be madeat such a time as to be offset by something favourable from the German pointof view. It will also be important to make it as clear as possible to the Germansthat this is in fact a final settlement. We will not be able to make a categoricalstatement to that effect, since it is laid down in the terms of reference of theWorking Party that its recommendations shall be confined to provisional readjust-ments which shall be subject to confirmation or-modifications by the terms ofthe final settlement with Germany, and that the establishment of the working party shall be without prejudice to the rights of the Governments concerned toraise their economic and territorial claims at a later date. We can, however,let it be generally understood that it is unlikely that there will be any furtherfrontier rectifications;E. BForeign Office, S.W.1,11th November, 1948. ,
.      ANNEX     -(Translation) .Working Party on Provisional Adjustments to the Western frontier of Germany 3REPORTIN implementation of the recommendations which appear in Section F ofthe report of the Six-Power Conference on Germany (1st June, 1948) and whichare laid out in detail in Annex K of the same report, a Working Party consistingof representatives of the United States of America, France, the United Kingdom,Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg has proceeded to examine the proposalsfor adjustments of the western frontier of Germany made by the Governmentsof the Netherlands, of Belgium, of Luxembourg and of. France.The Working Party has also examined the limits of the Saar.The Delegations met in Paris from 22nd July until 5th August. There wasthen an adjournment to allow certain representatives, who so requested, to visitcertain points of the frontier affected by the claims. The Delegations met again in Paris from 24th August to 1st September, 1948.The Working Party submits the present report to the attention of the Govern-ments concerned. According to the terms of Annex K mentioned above thesolutions which are recommended, if they are approved by Governments, wouldbe put into force as a provisional measure.Done in Paris in 6 copies the first day of September, 1948.(sgd.).........:.............................(for United States Delegation).(Sgd.).......................................(for Netherlands Delegation).(Sgd.).......................................(for Belgian Delegation).(Sgd.).......................................(for United Kingdom Delegation).......(Sgd.)........................................(for French Delegation).(Sgd.).................-.....................(for Luxembourg Delegation).Part I. General Observations1. In cases where a modification of the frontier is recommended, the working party proposes a line which is described in the report as precisely as possible.The Working Party wishes to stress the necessarily indicative nature of this line. It will be the function of a future Delimitation Commission to determine the exact line of the provisional frontier according to the indications which aregiven in the report and taking into account the various local interests at issue.2. In cases where the modifications of the frontier would involve the transferof an inhabited area to one of the four countries which border upon Germany,the Working Party recommends that the future of the inhabitants of such an area should be dealt with in the following way :  2German nationals who were in the area concerned before 23rd february,   j1948 (date of the opening of the First Session of the Six-Power Conference) should  -be given the opportunity : (a) either to settle in Germany; in this case they would be allowed to take with them the movable property which belongs to them, even whenthey wish to retain ownership of their real property,
.  (6) or to continue to reside in the area concerned.   They would, then haveno privileged status. No guarantee would be given against individualmeasures of expulsion; but any such measures of expulsion would bei. taken only as a defensive measure against subversive elements.)&quot;&quot;&quot;&apos; 3. The following idea was developed in the course of the discussions ofthe Working Party.With a view to avoiding in the future the creation of new anomalies it wouldbe desirable that by virtue of an international arrangement the construction ofnew buildings or roads should be forbidden within a reasonable distance of either side of the frontier. The Working Party considers that this questiongoes beyond its competence. Nevertheless, it draws the attention of the Govern-ments concerned to the value to be had by making a study of this suggestion.Part II. Rectification of the Western Frontier of germany the Working Party unanimously recommends the following modifications : A. German-Netherlands Frontier1. From frontier stone 202 E. to frontier stone 1963 the frontier should follow the west bank of the Wijmeersersdiep, leaving in Germany the track which follows this bank over the greater part of its length. As an exception to theabove, opposite the pumping station 1 kilometre south of Nieuwe Statenzijl,the apex of the triangle formed by the Wijmeersersdiep should be included inNetherlands territory, in such a way as to give to The Netherlands at this points strip of about 100 metres on the east bank of the present course of theWesterWoldsche A. It is understood that the Netherlands Government would bear the cost of or carry out the realignment of the Wijmeersersdiep resultingfrom this rectification.   (N.M. 1.)*2. Between Nieuwerschans and frontier stone 187 the frontier should runalong the east bank of the Moersloot.From frontier stone 187 to frontier stone 186 a strip of about 20 metres depthshould be ceded by Germany to the Netherlands.From frontier stone 186 to about 700 metres north of frontier stone 183 and between frontier stones 181 and 172 (Ter Apel) except for a distance of about180 metres to the north of frontier stone 176, the frontier should run along the east side of the track and. embankment.   (N.M. 4 &amp; 5.)3. Between frontier stones 49 and 41 the frontier should run along the eastbank of the Ramelbeek where this is not already the case; thence from a pointon the Nordhorn-Amelo Canal, just to the north of frontier stone 41, as far asfrontier stone 33 it should follow the east side of the German road about 75 metresfrom the present frontier, it being understood that the houses on the Germanside of the road would not be included in Netherlands territory; from frontierstone 33 to frontier stone 24 it should follow the east side of the Vrijedijk.(N.M. 14a, 14b.)4. Between frontier stones 15 and 5 the frontier should be drawn along a straight line between these two frontier stones in such a way, however, as toinclude in the Netherlands the tributaries of the River Dinkel and to take accountof the contours. , (N.M. 15.)5. To the south of Losser in the area of frontier stone 79 a small portionof German territory to the north of the River Dinkel should pass underNetherlands sovereignty in such a way that the frontier would follow the South Bank of-this river.   (N.M. 17.)t6. Between frontier stones 831 and 830 (Rekken) the path which followsthe frontier should be entirely included in the Netherlands.   (N.M. 20.)7. Between frontier stones 811 and 810 the frontier should follow the eastbank of the Ramsbeek.   (N.M. 20.)8. The German part of the village of Dinxperlo should come underNetherlands sovereignty.   The Delimitation Commission should be instructed to* N.M. 1^ Netherlands Memorandum of 22nd July, 1948, Tart II, Claim No. 1.t See also Part IV, A 1.
determine a new frontier line between  frontier stones 737 and 731, it being under-stood that Hubers Mill should remain in German territory; this line should beat a distance of about 300 metres from the present frontier.It is understood that arrangements should be made for the use of the roadby Germans living hi the frontier area on the basis of the pre-war arrangements-and subject to a simple and effective system of control: this system should beestablished by the Netherlands authorities and the British Occupation Authorities(N.M. 21.)     , &apos; &quot;9. From frontier stone 702 to frontier stone 660 the frontier should approxi-mately follow a straight line.  (N.M. C.)*10. From frontier stone 652 to the road junction 500 metres short of frontierstone 650 the track should be included entirely in Netherlands territory. Fromthe road junction to frontier stone 650 the road should be in German territory.(N.M. 28.)11. From the northern end of the Quer Dam the frontier should follow the south-eastern edge of the Quer Dam and the south bank of the Wijier Meer(in such a way as to include the road in Netherlands territory) as far as theroad which forks to Lagewald and from there it should follow the west sideof this road as far as frontier stone 627.   (N.M. 29.)12. Between frontier stone 594 and frontier stone 589 the road which follows the frontier should come entirely under Netherlands sovereignty.(N.M. 30.) -13. In the area of frontier stone 563 the frontier should be moved to theeast bank of the River Niers where over a distance of about 200 metres it atpresent follows the west bank.   (N.M. 32.)14. Between frontier stones 561 and 555 in the area of Hommersum thefrontier should be drawn along the following line :  .From frontier stone 561 to frontier stone 560 along the south side of theVee Dijk, then along the east side of the track which, after following the frontieras far as frontier stone 558; follows a straight line to frontier stone 555.Between frontier stones 537 and 535 the frontier should be moved so asto bring into the Netherlands the track which follows the frontier, it being under-stood that the local German users would retain access to this track.   (N.M. 33.)15. In the area of frontier stone 531 the frontier should cross the road atright angles at a point between the two road junctions. From there it should follow the west side of the road as far as frontier stone 532.   (N.M. 34.)16. In the area of Arcen the frontier should follow approximately a straightline between frontier stones 499 and 488, leaving in German territory the road between Walbech and Auwel via Lingsfort.Between frontier stones 484 and 480 the frontier should follow the east bankof the Lugenia Canal as far as the bridge opposite frontier stone 481. Fromthis bridge it should follow a straight line to frontier stone 480.  (N.M. 36.)17. In the area of Sittard the frontier should follow a line from frontierstone 324 to rejoin the present frontier to the north of Schinveld; this line, whoseexact course should be fixed by the Delimitation Commission, would leave inGerman territory the localities of Saeffelen, Hastenrath and Gangelt.   (N.M. D.)i 18. In the area of Ubach the track to the north-west of frontier stone 256should pass under Netherlands sovereignty for a distance of about 125 metres.(N.M. 49.)19. In the Rimburg-Kerkrade sector between frontier stones 239 and 238the frontier should follow the west side of the railway line from frontier stone239 as far as a point to the north of frontier stone 238 where a branch railway line crosses the River Wurm; from there it should follow the east bank of theRiver Wurm as far as frontier stone 238.   (N.M. 50, 51.)20. In the village of Kerkrade the road and the track which follow thefrontier between frontier stones 237 and 236, and between frontier stones 236 and234 respectively should come under Netherlands sovereignty.; Between frontier* This covers part of the Netherlands claim in the area of Elten.   The western part of this claim is the object of the suggestion in Part III A 2 and the eastern part is dealt with in Part IV A 3(a).
stones 232 and 229 the Working Party recommends that the Delimitation Corn-mission should seek to determine a frontier line mid-way between the two north/south roads. If the work of this Commission makes it clear that such a linewould result in more inconveniences than the present line, the de facto frontierat present marked by the fence should be confirmed.   (N.M. 52.)21. Between frontier stones 197 and 195 (Vaals) the road which runs along the frontier should come under Netherlands sovereignty. . (N.M. 53.)Note.-Where it is proposed that the frontier should run along the Germanbank of a river or stream, the Netherlands Delegation considers thatfor technical reasons a strip of territory should also be ceded to theNetherlands.This opinion was not unanimously adopted by the Working Partysince the British Delegation could not support it.B. German-Belgian Frontier1. Between frontier stones 1017 and 980 the frontier should fellow thefollowing line: From frontier stone 1017, the former limit of Kreis Lupen prolonged to theeast of the railway line at the entrance of the tunnel towards Aachen; thencea line along the railway as far as frontier stone 980.The attention of the Delimitation Commission should be especially &quot;drawn to the first of the general observations in respect of the houses situated in thenorth-eastern corner of this area.2. Between frontier stones 943 and 920 the road which runs along thefrontier should come under Belgian sovereignty, as also (a) the German customs post at the junction between this road and the road from Ober to Forstbach and the portion of this road opposite thecustoms post;(6) the forest of Freyen (Aachen-Eynatten).3. The road from Rbtgen to Konzen and the branch road from Fringshausto Lammersdorf should be transferred to Belgian sovereignty, it being understoodthat the Belgian Government&quot; would undertake to conclude with the Britishoccupation authorities a provisional arrangement to ensure the maintenance and use of these roads for transit traffic between Aachen and Monschau by theinhabitants of these two towns and of the area between them.In the arrangements to be concluded with the British occupation authoritiesprovision should also be made to ensure a simple and effective system of control which would prevent smuggling and any abuse of the roads.The above undertaking by the Belgian Government would cease as soon as another route between Monschau and Aachen is developed into a satisfactorycondition, and at the latest by a date to be fixed by common agreement betweenBelgian and British experts, taking account of technical considerations which only they are competent to judge.4. The German enclaves of Munsterbildchen, Rbtgen, Lammersdorf, Konzen,Motzenich and Ruitzhof to the west of the Raeren to Kalterherberg railway shouldbe included in Belgian territory; as also the village of Rbtgen up to a line which from frontier stone 886 F would come out at the railway in the area of frontierstone 790, leaving in German territory the Dreilagerbach Dam and reservoirand the hydraulic installations, it being understood that the Belgian authorities would undertake to do nothing which would prejudice the supply of the reservoir.A strip of an average width of 100 metres to the east of the railway should beceded to Belgium where this is possible without including German houses. TheAdministration of the Belgian railways would make the necessary arrangements,based on the rules governing the normal working of their system, to deal withthe new situation so created along the Belgo-German frontier.5. Between frontier stones 652 and 648&apos; the frontier should follow theBreitenbach stream.6. Between frontier stones 624 and 572 the German salient should be eliminated. The Delimitation Commission would be instructed to determine theline which would be most suitable to adopt.36076 c
7. In the region of Losheim the following areas should be ceded by Germanyto Belgium-(a) the triangle of forest-land extending for 1,500 metres to the north OfWeisserstein, bounded on the west by the present frontier and of awidth at its widest point of approximately 700 metres; ;&quot;\(b) the triangle between the present frontier and the road L.25 where tneroad leaves the present frontier south of Losheimergraben;(c) the area around Losheim village up to a line running east from the road/railway bridge north-west of Losheim, along the southern edge of the forest to the present Kreis boundary, thence south along the Kreisboundary to rejoin the present frontier at the road-bend 1,000 metressouth-east of Losheim railway station;(d) the road L.25 through this area.If after an examination by British and Belgian experts it isfound that &quot;the alternative road which the Belgian government considers to be adequate, is not equally satisfactory, a time-limit wouldbe fixed by common agreement between the experts for the adequatedevelopment and improvement by the Germans of the alternative. .  . road.  In this case, during the agreed period the Belgian Governmentwould permit German transit traffic to use road L.25 in accordancewith arrangements to be worked out with the British occupation authorities. These arrangements would include adequate provisions to prevent smuggling and any other abuse of the road.8. Between frontier stones 159 and 151 the German enclave to the west of the St. Vith-Trois Vierges railway and a strip of about 100 metres to theeast of this railway should be included in Belgian territory.G German-Luxembourg frontier to the east of Vianden the frontier should be modified in such a way as toinclude in Luxembourg territory the forest called Kammerwald and the village of Roth.The new frontier should follow a line from the south of Roth to the west of Obersgegen and should then run north, following the river Gay as far as thesouth of the Wirbelkopf. Then, after passing slightly to the north of hill (trig,point) 497-5 (between Neuscheuerhof and Bauler), it would rejoin thepresent frontier at a point on the present frontier about 1,200 metres south-west of Bauler. The future Delimitation Commission should be instructed to establish the exact frontier line.D. French-German frontier to the north of Wissembourg the village of Schweigen should be includedin French territory.*Part IIIAgreement cannot be reached on certain frontier rectifications but theWorking Party recommends that in the following cases special arrangements should be concluded: A. German-Netherlands Frontier1. The Ems Estuary and the Dollart. The Working Party has been unableto reach unanimous agreement on frontier rectifications in the Ems Est uary andthe Dollart. In view of the absence of a frontier in the Ems Estuary defined by international agreement it recommends that as a provisional measure arrange-ments should be worked out between the Netherlands authorities and the british military occupation authorities with a view to (a) facilitating the detailed study of the projected plans for the developmentof the Ems Estuary and for the reclamation of the Dollart;(6) ensuring that no work is undertaken in the Ems Estuary, apart from ,normal routine dredging, without the consent of both parties.   The - *Netherlands authorities and the British military occupation authori-ties will agree upon rules to cover the extent of normal routinedredging.* This covers part of the French claim for Schweigen and the forest of Mundat.   See alsoPart IV B.
2. The dUe-a Area-&quot;  The Working Party has been unable to reach agree-ment on the western part of the Netherlands claim (rectification of the frontieron the River Rhine between frontier stones 657 and 660) but it recommends thatthe Netherlands authorities, in accordance with arrangements to be agreed withihe British occupation authorities, should have the right to anchor, search andVontrol vessels over the entire width of the river.B.- German-Luxembourg FrontierThe Rivers Our, Sur and Moselle along the German-Luxembourg frontierare at present jointly owned by Germany and Luxembourg. The LuxembourgGovernment has demanded&quot;&quot; the exclusive ownership of these rivers and the. establishment of international servitudes on the German bank which would permit the Luxembourg Government to rest on the German bank the installations whichare necessary for the regularisation of the rivers and for the establishment of communications between the two banks.The American, Belgian, French and Netherlands Delegations have supported this demand. &quot;The British Delegation was unable to recommend the claim and the working party has finally agreed upon the following proposal: The French occupation authorities should be authorised to conclude withthe Luxembourg Government arrangements which would permit theLuxembourg Government to establish in these rivers installations necessaryfor the regularisation of the rivers and for the re-establishment of commu-nications between the two banks and which would further permit themto rest these installations on the German bank.Part IVTaking account of the observations mads in the course of the preliminarystudy, the Governments concerned have not maintained certain of their proposalsfor modifying the frontier. Other proposals, however (although the competence of the Working Party to deal with them has not been disputed) have not been supported by all the Delegations. These points, which are recommended only bya majority of the Working Party, are as follows : A. German-Netherlands Frontier1. To the south of Losser; apart from the rectification unanimously recom-mended by the Working Party, t the Belgian, French and Luxembourg Delegationsconsider that they can recommend the Netherlands claim for a portion of territory to the south of the River Dinkel.   (N.M. 17.)2. In the following cases the Belgian, French and Luxembourg Delegationshave recommended the acceptance of the Netherlands claims. The American delegation could also have accepted them if unanimity had been reached. TheBritish Delegation, however, did not consider that the arguments in favourof rectification were sufficiently strong. Nevertheless, they would have beenprepared to agree to the rectifications proposed provided the Netherlands Delega-tion could agree to the elimination of certain anomalies by three small rectification-tions in Germany&apos;s favour. The Netherlands Delegation was, however, unableto agree to these arrangements since the Netherlands people could never acceptcession of territory to Germany.   These points are : (a) The Netherlands Delegation requested that the frontier should be drawnalong the track from frontier stone 826 to frontier stone 821.(N.M. 20.)(b) The Netherlands Delegation requested that the frontier should be drawn in a straight line between frontier stones 719 and 725.  (N.M. 22.)&apos;(c) The Netherlands Delegation requested that from frontier stone 578 thefrontier should run along the south side of the Reichswald to the trackjunction north of frontier stone 571, thence to frontier stone 570 and thence on the eastern side of the road to frontier stone 568. (N.M. 31.)(d) The Netherlands Delegation requested that the frontier should run along the north side of the track 300 metres north of frontier stone 478in a straight line to frontier stone 476.   (N.M. 37.) &amp;* Netherlands Memorandum, I C.   See also Part II A, No. 9 and Part IV A, 3(a).f See II A, No. 5.36076 c 2
(e) The Netherlands Delegation requested that the frontier should run ina straight line from &quot;frontier stone 476 to frontier stone 484. (N.M. 38.)(/) The Netherlands Delegation requested that west of frontier stone 452the frontier should follow the north-western side of the track tofrontier stone 448.   (N.M. 40.) ^(g) The Netherlands Delegation requested that the two small pockets on^the east and west sides of frontier stone 363 should be eliminated,as also the two small pockets to either side of frontier stone 370 andthat between frontier stones 376 and 373 the frontier should run onthe south side of the Rothen stream.   (N.M. 43.)3. In the following cases the Belgian, French and Luxembourg Delegationshave supported the Netherlands claims. The American Delegation could also have accepted them if unanimity had been reached. The British Delegationhowever is unable to recommend these claims : (a) In the area of Emmerich the Netherlands Delegation claimed that thearea between the present frontier and the autobahn under construction,including the autobahn itself, should pass under Netherlandssovereignty from frontier stone 702 to the point south of Gendringenwhere the autobahn at present passes through Netherlands territory.(N.M. C.)* &quot;(b) The Netherlands Delegation requested that in the area of Venlo thefrontier should run in a straight line from frontier stone 457 tofrontier stone 454.   [N.M. 39.)(c) In the area of Melick and Jtierkenboch the Netherlands Delegation desired the incorporation into the Netherlands of the triangle of german territory to the south of the spit of Netherlands territory whichpenetrates into Germany in this area.   (N.M. 42.)(d) In the area of Niederbusch the Netherlands Delegation proposed a frontier line which would include Niederbusch in Netherlands territory and which would thence follow the natural division between thecultivated area and the heath-land as far as frontier stone 257.(N.M&apos;. 47 and 48.)(e) The Netherlands Delegation proposed that the salient of Lenders from about frontier stone 209 to frontier stone 197 should be eliminated.. (N.M. 52a). . &apos;\*-.B. French-German FrontierThe French Delegation proposed that part of the forest of Mundat (to thenorth-west of Wissembourg) should be re-attached to French territory.The American, Belgian, Luxembourg and Netherlands Delegations havesupported this recommendation but the British Delegation has been unable torecommend it. t part VThe American and British Delegations considered that the following proposals for rectifications to the western frontier of Germany could not be dealtwith by the Working Party since it is impossible to regard them as &quot; minor &quot;rectifications.A. -German-Netherlands Frontier-Bentheim BochtThe Netherlands Government has proposed the elimination of the BentheimBocht by incorporating this territory in the Netherlands.The Belgian, French and Luxembourg Delegations have recognised that thisproposal can be discussed by the Working Party and have supported it.The British Delegation has been unable to consider this of a minornature because of the size of the area, its population and its economic value.The American Delegation has been unable to accept the claim because ofthe importance to the German economy of the oil-field of Emmlicheim.t* See also Part II, point 9, and fart III A. 2.f See also II D.% Owing to the importance attached by the Netherlands Delegation to this claim, the minorrectifications in this area were not studied in detail.   (N.M. 7-13).
^-German-Luxembourg Frontier-The Our DamThe Luxembourg Government has demanded the cession by Germany of thearea necessary for carrying out the plan for constructing dams on the Our andits tributary, the Irsen.The Belgian, French and Netherlands Delegations have considered that this&quot;proposal can be discussed and recommended.The American and British Delegations on the other hand contested the&apos;competence of the Working Party in this matter.   In their view it is a questionof a frontier modification over too great an area and based on economic considerations of such importance that they exceed the competence of the working party.These two Delegations have emphasised that their attitude implies no,judgment on the merits of the Luxembourg project and that a pronouncement onthe possibility of its future execution is a matter for consideration elsewhereC. French-German Frontier-KehlThe French Government has demanded the attachment of Kehl to France.This attachment could be effected either by annexation or by a long-terminternational servitude.The Belgian, Luxembourg and Netherlands Delegations have pronouncedthemselves in favour of this demand.The American and British Delegations expressed the opinion that the Frenchclaim for Kehl is based on economic considerations which do not fall withinthe competence of the Working Party and that this question has, moreover, a major political aspect; for this reason it is their view that the Working party is unable to consider the claim.Part VILimits of the SaarThe Working Party unanimously recommends to the, approval of the SixGovernments the delimitation of the Saar territory as established by the ordinanceof the French Commander-in-Chief in Germany, dated 6th June, 1947, includingthe following three modifications proposed by the French Delegation : Incorporation in the territory of the Saar of (i) the triangular road junction between Dunzweiler on the one hand andLautenbach and Hbchen on the other;(ii) the commune of Waldmohr;(iii) the commune of Kirrberg.
