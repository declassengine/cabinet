THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF. HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1948SECRET Coff No.31CP. (48) 2523rd November, 1948CABINETINQUIRY INTO CAPITAL punishment memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotlandOn 22nd July, on the consideration by the^ Commons of the lords amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill, the Home Secretary made a statement about the question of capital punishment on lines which had been approvedby the Cabinet that day (CM. (48) 53rd Conclusions). The statement was asfollows (Hansard, 22nd July, cols. 710-711) :-&quot; The dropping of this Clause from the Bill does not mean theabandonment of the issues which it has raised. The long discussion in bothHouses of the question of the death penalty has brought this question intothe full forefront of public consciousness. I do not myself believe that public opinion, although sections of it may be opposed to the completesuspension of the capital penalty at this time, is irreconcilably opposed tosome change in the present law under which this the only penalty for alloffences of murder. I believe that the searching debates on this subject have prepared the way for further consideration of the direction&quot; in which thetaw should be amended.In both Houses there has been revealed in all parties a considerable bodyof opinion which desires that some steps should be taken which will marka definite amelioration of the law relating to the death penalty. TheGovernment welcome this attitude and propose to explore without delay thepractical means there are of limiting the death penalty to certain crimesof murder in a manner which would not be open to the objections taken against the recent effort to reach a compromise. I hope that it may thenbe possible for Parliament to give further consideration to this question as a separate issue.&quot; -Later in the debate the Lord President of the Council said (loc. cit.,col. 735) :-&quot; I do not think it would be right for a Minister at this Box, beforethe proposed investigation takes place and the results of it are known, to declare that there is going to be a^Bill in this Parliament which is going tobe put on the Statute Book during this Parliament.&quot;2. The Government is thus committed to further investigation of thissubject, and we have been considering what form the investigation, should take.The proposed compromise clause in the Criminal Justice Bill, which was subjected to strong criticism in the House of Commons and was rejected by the House ofLords, was devised after the most careful consideration of possible alternatives,and we are satisfied that, if the investigation took the form of a further attempt by the Departments to devise.a compromise, it would not be likely to produceanv solution which would be accepted by Parliament and by public&quot; opinion. Itwill therefore be necessary, in our view, that the investigation should be conducted by some body set up for the purpose. A Departmental Committee would not be suitable, because it would not carry sufficient authority. At the meeting of theCabinet on 22nd July it was suggested that it might be helpful to appoint a36082 ,
2small committee including persons of different shades of political opinion toconsider how the death penalty could best be limited, but this is not whollyor mainly a political question, and for this reason a committee representingdifferent shades of political opinion would be open to objection : moreover, itwould- be difficult to find prominent persons representing different shades ofpolitical opinion who have not already committed themselves to One or other sideof this controversy. The same objection applies to a Select Committee; opinionon a Select Committee would inevitably tend to divide itself along party lines;as happened in the case of the last Select Committee on this subject: in any event a new Select Committee would have to be representative of both Houses,and the House of Lords has already declared itself against any amendment ofthe law.There remains the alternative of a Royal Commission, and in our view theappointment of a Royal Commission is the only course that can be adopted. Thestatus of a Royal Commission would be appropriate to the importance of thesubject, and it would be possible, though it would no doubt be difficult, to findpersons to serve on the Commission who would carry public confidence and whohave not associated themselves with any particular view on the question of capital punishment.It was suggested at the Cabinet meeting on 22nd July that the terms ofreference of any committee which might be appointed should be so drawn as to relieve it of the task of considering afresh the general arguments for and againstthe total abolition of capital punishment. If, however, a Royal Commission is appointed it would scarcely be practicable to exclude from its scope considerationof the question whether the death penalty should be abolished altogether. To doso would mean drafting the terms of reference on the basis that capital punishmentis to be retained, and that the Commission has merely to consider to what crimesor in what circumstances this punishment should be applied. Such terms ofreference might arouse criticism and would not achieve their object because itwould still be open to the Commission to recommend that capital punishmentshould not be applied to any crimes or in any circumstances. It would clearly be preferable to include the issue of abolition within the Commission^ terms ofreference from the outset.3.   We suggest the following terms of reference for the Royal Commission : To consider and report whether capital punishment should be retained orabolished, and, if retained, whether, and if so to what extent and by whatmeans, liability to suffer it should be limited or modified; and if recommenda-tions are made to limit, modify or abolish the liability to suffer capital punishment, under what conditions and for how long persons who would otherwise have been liable to suffer it should be detained, and what changesin the existing law and the prison system would be required.These terms of reference direct attention to the important questions (uponwhich no light has been thrown by the debates in either House), what is to done,if capital punishment is abolished or limited, with persons who would otherwise have been hanged, how long it would be practicable to detain them, and what effect the necessity of their prolonged detention would have upon the prison system..4. The task of a Commission with these terms of reference would inevitably be a long one. It would be necessary for them to take evidence from foreigncountries and it. might well be necessary for the Commission to visit foreigncountries, in order to ascertain how and to what extent the problem of the alter-native to capital punishment has been solved in practice in those countries whichhave abolished capital punishment. The selection and appointment of suitable persons as members of the Commission would require careful consideration,and we contemplate that it would take some months to settle the membership. Wecan see no prospect of a Royal Commission, if it is appointed, presenting a reporton this subject during the lifetime of this Parliament, or indeed before the election in 1950.5. If our colleagues agree that the appointment of a Royal commission is the right course, the question arises whether an announcement of the Govern-ment&apos;s intention to appoint a Royal Commission should be made how. There are,in our view, certain considerations which are strongly in favour of this course :-(1) It is unlikely, in view of the statements quoted in the first paragraphof this memorandum, that it will be long before a Question is asked
in the House as to what steps the Government is taking in pursuanceof the undertaking given in those statements. The matter might beraised on the adjournment. In any event it is likely to be raised whenthe Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill reaches the House of Commons.It might be raised by the introduction of a Private Member&apos;s Bill. Ifaction is postponed until the matter is raised in the House the impres-sion will be created of reluctance on the part of the Government to do what it has undertaken to do.(2) It is possible that those who wish to see a change in the law relating to capital punishment may be content not to press the matter, in the belief that, in the meantime, the prerogative will be exercised in allcases of murder, and they may find support for this belief in the factthat there has been no case since February last in which the capitalsentence has been carried out. As the law stands, however, it isimpossible to recommend the exercise of the prerogative upon anyother principles than those upon which its exercise has been recommended in the past, though it may be proper to give these principles a wide application in individual cases. Sooner or la^rfer acase is bound to occur in which there will be no alternative but torecommend that there should be no interference with the sentence.When this happens, if the Government, in the meantime, has taken no further step in regard to the general issue of capital punishment,the decision in the individual case is likely to be called into question,and the Government will be pressed to do something about the generalissue. To announce then that the Government proposes to set up a royal Commission would not only have the appearance of yielding to pressure, but might even convey the unfortunate impression that thisdecision had been prompted by criticism of the action taken in th?individual case. We cannot but think that the announcement in thesecircumstances of the appointment of a Royal Commission would be interpreted in a sense very unfavourable to the Government, and might indeed be embarrassing to us in continuing to carry out our duty of advising on the exercise of the prerogative.(3) If, on the other hand, an announcement is made now of the Government &apos;intention to set up a Royal Commission, criticism of a refusal torecommend a reprieve in a particular case will be very much easier todeal with, and the Government cannot be accused of inaction, bad faith, oftt-submission to pressure.6. We therefore ask for the approval of the Cabinet to the proposal toappoint a Royal Commission, and to the terms of reference suggested, and for authority to make qn announcement at the earliest opportunity in the present session that the Government has decided to set up a Royal Commission with these terms of reference. This could be done by an arranged Question and Answer.J. C. E.J( W.3rd November, 1948
