THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MA.JESTY&quot;,S Q0VERK1ENT)SECRET&apos;C.P.(U8)  2382QTH OCTOBER.  19U6n   T3T7*TT?rnHOUSE OP COMMONS:    FRIvAYE Z:EWSER3 ? THISMemorandum by -the Lord. President of the council at their meeting on loth October (CiLI.(h-S) 6hthConclusions, Minute 2) the Cabinet invited me to consider withthe Chief Whip how best to give effect to their decision thatthere should be some restoration of Private Members1 time inthe 1948-^9 session.    It will be recalled that in their       &apos; .discussion the Cabinet were, on the whole, inclined to favourmaking time available for Bills rather than notions, and thesuggestion was made that six Fridays might be made availablefor Second Reading debates between the &quot;beginning of the session and Christmas, together with, two 3r three days later in the Session for the remaining stages of any Bills thatmight receive a Second Reading.2. The. Chief Whip and I are satisfied that it is nowtoo late to offer for private Members&apos; Bills the first twoor three Fridays after the beginning of the Session, sinceMembers might legitimately complain that they were not being given adequate notice to enable them to take proper advantageof the facilities.We accordingly think that,  if the proposal is to be proceeded with,  the best plan would bo to give ten Fridaysin all,  Including seven Fridays for Second Eadings betweenChristmas and Easter and three Fridays after ..aitsun for theremaining stages of any Bills that may get through StandingN committee.   An alternative would be to give for SecondReadings Fridays 26th November and 3rd and loth December inthe period before- Christmas and four Fridays in the period between Christmas and Easter,  together with three Fridaysfor remaining stages after Whitsun.In suggesting- that a total or ten Fridays should begiven, we have had regard to the recommendatiea .? the SelectCommittee on Procedure who proposed that the first twentyFridays of the Session after the conclusion of the deb ,te onthe Address should be allotted to Private Meisbers,  ten beingfor Motions and ten for Bills.3. Once the Cabinet have decided on what amount ofPrivate Membere    time is to be allowed, and at what period ofthe Session the time is to be made available, the House willhave to be informed, and the Prime Minister should do this inhis opening speech in the debate on the Address.   Moreover,if, as suggested in paragraph 2,  it is decided to give thetime after Christmas,  it will be necessary to pass a MotionCOPY NO.11
on the second day of the new Session taking the whole tineof the House before Christmas for the&apos;Government and   -preventing, the introduction of Private Members&apos; Bills, since,if Private Members were allowed to introduce their Billsimmediately, they would secure places in anticipation of the ballot, which would be unfair.It is assumed&apos; that the Cabinet would not wish alsoto revive the introduction of Bills under the &quot;fen sixaitesrule51.    The ;!Ten minutes rule&quot; procedure can, it should benoted, be abused, because there is no limit to the numberof Motions which can be moved on certain days of the week.4* - As I warned the- Cabinet on 18th. October, we havea heavy programme of Government legislation and, though itis at this stage impossible to make accurate forecasts, since we do not know how controversial some of the Bills in theprogramme will prove to be,  I must warn rny colleagues thatthe allocation of ten days for Private Members * time nay welljeopardise the chances of some of the Bills now includedin the programme..   Thus, we may have to drop some of thelarge number of minor Bills which the Cabinet have approved,particularly those which are not in an advanced state of preparation.    Nor can we be sure that certain Bills outsidethe &quot;minor&quot; group will be safe.   We may be cramped for timefor special debates wanted by the House and desirabledebates on the work of the public corporations.5. It should also,  I think, be borne in mind that,to judge by past experience^ the major pai^t of the work ox&apos;dealing with Private Members&apos; Bills will fall on one or two departments, namely the Home Office,  the Board of Trade anathe Ministry of Health, all of whom,  and particularly theHome Office,  have a very heavy Legislative Programme tocarry through in the 1948-49 Session.H .M .Office of the Lord President of theC council, S.W.1.,20th October,  1948.
