! 22(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(b8^)  Z2L COPY HO.  -___1UTH OCTOBER,  igk.8CABINETREPARATIONS AND TEE EUROPEAN RECOVERY programme memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will already be aware that for somemonths past the United States Administration have been seekingthrough a series of Committees and a multiplicity of departments- to review the German reparations programme for capital equipment in the interests of the European Recovery Programme.      UnderSection 115 (^0  of the Economic Co-operation Act,  the economic co-operation Administration &quot;will request the United states secretary of State to obtain the agreement- of those countries concerned that such capital equipment as is scheduled for removalas reparations from the three Western Zones of Germany should beretained in Germany if such retention will most- effectively serve the purposes of the European Recovery Programme&quot;.2. Owing to a misunderstanding of the situation on theAmerican side,  the United States Government did not- appreciate that dismantling was in progress at many unallocated plants in theBritish Zone.      Indeed,  in early June Mr. Marshall, without rayknowledge, had informed Senator Vandenberg that dismantling wasnot in progress at any of the plants which had not formally been&quot;released&apos;&apos; by the United States after a review which had taken placein the spring of this year without producing any final.recommendations acceptable to the United States Administration.3- At the end of August the State Department informed our embassy in Washington that Mr. Hoffman had set up a Committeeheaded by Mr. Humphrejr, on independent businessman,  to conduct afurther examination of certain plaints on the reparations list witha view to reaching definite decisions within ninety days on what should be retained in Germany.U-* I considered it necessary to leave the United states administration in no doubt as to my views on their hesitant andprocrastinating policy and as to the  effects which I feared this might- have on our situation in Germany, on the countries entitledto receive reparations and on our own securitjr.    - I accordinglyaddressed a note to Mr. Marshall  (Annex &apos;A&apos;) in terms which were acceptable to the Chiefs of Staff.5. Mr. Marshall replied (Annex &apos;B&apos;) formally requesting a cessation of dismantling at the plants (numbering about 200 in theBritish Zone) under examination by the Committee,  as well as myco-operation with the Humphrey Committee in their investigation.Shortly after receiving this letter I discussed the question withMr. Marshall and M.  Schuman in Paris,  and subsequently put forward to Mr. Marshall in a further letter (Annex  &apos;C) proposals which,went some way to meet the United States point- of view.      I declined,
however,  to stop dismantling at plants where -this had already begun, since I was advised that once stopped it would in alllikelihood prove impossible ever to restart dismantling on anadequate scale,  with incalculable effects upon the reparationsprogramme,  the level of industry in Germany and the securityobjectives to which we attach importance.6. I received no reply to this letter, but on 13th OctoberMr. Hoffman came from Washington with the express purpose of discussing this question with me.     He told me that the emotionsaroused among members of Congress on the dismantling question were causing him grave concern.      Unless some agreement could bereached he feared that there would be adverse effects on thesecond E.R.P, appropriation.     He also referred to theparticularly embarrassing situation in which he found himself as a result of the misunderstanding about the status ofdismantling in the British Zone to which I have referred inparagraph 2 above.      He appealed most urgently to me -(a) to co-operate with the Humphrey Committee in there-examination of certain plants;(b) to.stop dismantling in those plants in the british zone where it was now in progress.7. I. informed Mr. Hoffman that I could not agree to an interruption of the dismantling programme for reasons with whichhe was already familiar.      I would, however,  explore the technicalpossibilities of making administrative arrangements in connectionwith dismantling which would enable him to give some reassuranceto United States critics and would at the same time help to avoidrendering incapable of re-erection in Germany plants which itmight eventually be decided  to retain.      I also welcomed his suggestion that there should be close consultation between theHumphrey Committee and British representatives in order to accelerate action and avoid unduly divergent policies betweendismantling on our side and recommendations for retention ontheirs.8. At the conclusion of our meeting a paper was drafted,the text of which is given in Armex  &apos;D&apos;.      This is the document which I ask my colleagues to consider.9. The crucial point lies in paragraph 2.     I amexamining urgently with British representatives in Germany howeffect can best be given in practice to the principle- set forth in this paragraph.      I do not pretend  to think that the proposed arrangements will be easy to operate or will not give rise tofurther difficulty with our American partners;    but I believethat in the circumstances they represent the best basis on which agreement can be reached.10. I accordingly seek the authority of my colleagues,subject to consultation with the French -(a) to have discretion to inform the United states administration of my willingness to meet them on the principle inparagraph 2 in whatever terras appear most appropriate in the lightof the technical&apos;recommendationsj(b) subject to (a),  to inform the United States Administrationthat I am willing to proceed in reparations policy in the manner proposed in the documents,  provided that they are willing to dothe&apos; same;
(c)    to make clear to the United States Administration myunderstanding (confirmed orally by Mr. Hoffman)  that when theHumphrey Committee has completed its report it will be transmitted to Mr. Hoffman and by him to Mr. Marshall and thatit- will not become binding upon His Majesty&apos;s Government   untilmy agreement,  and that of the French Government,   to its recommendations has been sought- and obtained.11. I may be able to supplement this memorandum orally atthe meeting of the Cabinet as by that  time the question willhave been discussed with technical experts.E.B.Foreign Office, S.W.  l.,lhth October, I9I48,
ANNEX &apos;A&apos;Mr. Bevin to Mr. Marshall. 4th September, 19U8.1. I am profoundly disturbed at Hoffman&apos;s statedintention to undertake a fresh enquiry, on the strength ofSection 1153? of the Economic Co-operation Act,  into the questionof what plants, if any, now scheduled for reparations, shouldbe retained in Germany in the interests- of E.R.P.      I cannothelp thinking that this proposal,  if acted upon, will have .very far reaching consequences outside the economic field and I earnestly hope that before anything further is done you will agree that we should look at the implications of the schemetogether in consultation with our military advisers.2. Six months ago I agreed in principle to considerretaining a small number of plants in Germany,  if that would help B.R.P.      I understood that a list of 20 or 30 plants &quot;wouldbe involved and I said I would be ready to look at it.      Nosuch list was ever produced and instead a United StatesTechnical Mission went to Germany, but I have never seen itsreport, though I have been frequently assured, over the past three months that final decisions would shortly be taken in washington on the basis of that report.      Now it is beingsuggested that the work of investigation should start all overagain, and that the reparations programme should be held upmeanwhile,  perhaps for as much as four months.      This createswhat I must regard as a new situation.3. I have never been asked to suspend the dismantling ofany particular plant,  although I was prepared to considerdoing so if given a short list of plants to look at.Dismantling has gone steadily on and is now in progress atsome 200 plants in the British Zone.      In the United States Zoneit is, I understand, already almost complete.      At many ofthese plants in the British Zone dismantling has not yet gone farbut another three months would, make a lot    of difference.      Onthe other hand a reduction in the rate of dismantling,  or afortiori its interruption, would put the whole reparationsprogramme in jeopardy.      The Germans do not want to payreparations, although they are at present carrying out the dismantling programme&apos; with a fairly good grace.      But once wefalter, all the German politicians who have been appealingagainst dismantling over the heads of the Military governors and our two Governments,, will believe themselves to havebeaten us;    and they will be right.     With the formation of a western German Government a few months hence,  German resistance to reparations can be counted upon to harden.      It is therefore not the future of certain plants which is now in question butthe whole reparations policy of the three Western Powers.3y far the greater part of the dismantling still to be doneis in the British Zone.      Please believe that the position isas I describe it.      If- I accept Hoffman&apos;s proposal and thereis a further three or four months&apos;, delay,  reparations arefinished once and for all.      We must face that fact and its implications.h. It is not only the plants on the existing reparationslist which are at issue.     When we drew up the revised Levelof Industry Plan over a year ago we excluded from consideration,
at Glay&apos;s insistence, the so-called &quot;Prohibited Industries&quot;.We have still not reached final decisions about this mostimportant group.      The Military Governors are now under instructions from their Governments to study these industries and to make recommendations concerning them.      No reparationslist for these industries has been drswn up, and if dismantlingof plants 7/hich&apos;have been scheduled for reparations for monthswere now to be suspended it wouid never be possible to carryout a reparations programme in the prohibited industries field which is,  of course, the most important of all from the securitypoint of view.5. The issue is therefore whether to continue our existing reparations plans in substantially their present form    -and tempo,  or to abandon them and with them our whole policyof industrial disarmament.      Unless we intend to give upreparations I fear that another review of the reparationsprogramme would be disastrous.      I am quite prepared as before toconsider withdrawing from reparations a small number of selectedplants, for the withdrawal of which a good case can be made out;but&apos; if this is to be done I would only say that it must bedone quickly.      - ,6. Our two Governments are committed, and rightly in my view,  to the industrial disarmament of Germany.      His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have throughout pursued a consistent and moderatepolicy in this respect.      When the quadripartite Level ofIndustry Plan was being negotiated in i 945 a.nd 1946, we wereconsistently in a minority of one,  advocating against theopposition of all our Allies levels two and even three times as great as those considered sufficient by our Allies.      Subsequentlythe United States Government came round to our way of thinking,and the revised Level of Industry Plan is very close to theoriginal British proposals;    we do not now want to rush to theother extreme.7. Quite sport from the fact that we are deeply committed to the disarmament of Germany, and that the peace of mind ofGermany&apos;s neighbours depends upon our honouring the undertakinginto which we have entered, I consider that the industrialdisarmament of Germany is as necessary as ever it was.      It istrue that the danger of a resurgent and aggressive Germany hasreceded;    but we are now faced by the new menace of Germanyallied to, or occupied by the Soviet Union, whose industriesmay be used to feed the Soviet war potential.      The necessityof physically removing the element of war potential from german industry is therefore as great as ever,  and indeed much more urgent than before;    and the reparations programme is the only means we have of removing it.8. There are many economic and political arguments foradhering to our&apos; reparations policyj    but security is the over-riding consideration.      I hope you will agree with methat, as an immediate step,  our two Governments should jointlyseek the advice of the Combined Chiefs of Staff upon the effectsin the defence field of any deviation from our present policy for the industrial disarmament of Western Germany.      I thinkmoreover that it might be desirable that we should find some means of associating- the French Government with these discussions.      I ask you. to agree that we should receive,  and consult together upon,  the advice of the Combined Chiefs ofStaff before doing or saying anything further which might castdoubt upon our determination to carry through the reparationsprogramme.&quot;
9. There ore also other considerations which I suggestwe must take-into account before reaching any final conclusions.10, The effect on other members of I. A. E. A. would be rnontserious.      Some of them ore participants in the european recovery Programme,  others are not.      in either case thetermination of the reparations programme would deal a serious blow to their recovery plans.      I can speak feelingly on this pointbecause we in the United Kingdom are counting on certain plantfrom Germany to help us restore our external trade.11. There are also other international considerations.There is the effect upon the Germans themselves of abandoning the reparations programme.      We should be playing right intothe hands of all their agitators.      German politicians andpublicists will flatter themselves that they have inducedus to abandon our intentions;    the whole German people willbe encouraged to think that if they complain loud enoughthey will be able to get away with anything;    and the prestige and authority of the Occupying Powers will suffer a seriousdecline.12. Finally there is the effect upon the U.S.S.R.      if at this particular moment action is taken which they willrecognise to mean the end of the reparations programme, theRussians will assume that we are deliberately taking this step in order to deprive them of any further reparations from theWestern Zones of Germany.      They-would not. only regard this asa most serious breach of Potsdam;    it would also make any hopeof reaching agreement much more remote.13. I fully understand that you have to face questions andcriticisms about a programme which appears at first sightto be inconsistent with European recovery and which cannotbe expected to have a popular appeal.      I know how difficultall this can be because we too have our critics of the reparations programme in this country who are very active and.have a lot of plausible arguments.      But I do not regard this as a reason for taking a step which may have incalculableconsequences.      I beg you that we may have an opportunityof looking at all these aspects of the problem together beforeirrevocable steps are taken.
ANNEX.  TB&apos;Mr. Marshall to Mr.&quot;Bevin, 16th September, 1948.I refer to your recent note on the examination of plants in Germany scheduled for reparations as proposed byMr. Hoffman, which has been given me by Sir Oliver.I appreciate the importance of the several considerationsbrought out in your note.     Their importance has been a stronginfluence in determining our policy with regard to reparations.In particular,&apos;l realise the danger that reparations might be exceedingly difficult to revive should dismantling come to ahalt during the period Mr. Hoffman&apos;s Committee is reviewing thesituation.     We shall do everything we possibly can to have thenew survey made as speedily as possible and to obtain the releaseof plants as the study progresses so  that dismantling will not-come completely to a halt.      I entirely agree with you that noirrevocable steps should be  taken regarding the further limitationof reparations without the fullest consultation between ourGovernments &quot;and the French.Beyond this&quot; we cannot go at this time.     Because ofour very large expenditures directly for the support of Germanyand for the European Recovery Programme, there is a strong feeling among our people and particularly in Congress that weshould not agree to the removal of plants from Germany, which if left In operation there,  would reduce our total financial burden under the European Recovery Programme.      This feelinghas been expressed in the Economic Co-operation Act.     Admittedly,much time must be  taken up in the initial examination of theplants scheduled for reparations.     We had hoped that this examination would yield a ba;jis on which to proceed..    If we had adopted the recommendations resulting from that examination,however, we should have had to request you to agree to a verylarge increase in the German level of industry.     We considerthat the facts supporting those recommendations do not warrantour doing so and overriding the many other considerations outlined in your note, in particular the political and security aspects.It is our intention that any request for retention of plants inGermany made of you shall be based upon adequate technicalevidence that any such plants could make an important contributionto European Recovery if retained in Germany.On the other hand,  members of CongressionalAppropriations Committees have clearly indicated to Mr. Hoffmanthat future appropriations for European recovery will-be made only after Mr. Hoffman has demonstrated that he has adequatelyexamined the potential usefulness in Germany of plants scheduledfor reparations and has requested me to obtain consent from you andthe French to retain in Germany such of those plants as can bettercontribute to the European Recovery Programme if left in Germany;.This he is required  to do by Section 115 (F)  of the Act which isquoted as follows;&quot;The Administrator will request the Secretary ofState to obtain the agreement of those countries concerned that such capital equipment as is scheduled for removal as reparations from the three Western Zones of Germany beretained in Germany if such retention will most effectivelyserve the purposes of the European Recovery Programme&quot;.
I am entirely in agreement with Mr. Hoffmen as to thenecessity for his examination of the plants.     We agree further that the points emphasised in your Note make it essential thatthe examination be completed with the utmost speed.      Mr. Hoffmanhas indicated that to this end he hes already revised his plans totake maximum advantage of the facilities and data available to .the Zonal authorities.     In view of the foregoing I strongly urgothat you accept as of paramount importance the request which this government hhs made to permit this&apos;further re-examination of theplants in the British Zone,  approximately 176, which have notyet been released from consideration.      In order that these plantsmay not be dissipated, I also request that dismantling allocationand shipment of these plants be suspended temporarily during theperiod of the examination.     L list of the affected plants isbeing furnished to the British Embassy here.. I suggest the possibility that dismantling of thoseplants not effected by the review of the E.C./i. Committee be soscheduled as to obtain maximum continuity of dismantling operations during the period of the examination.In view of our recognition of the security problems which are inherent in a halt in dismantling,  it is my judgment thatthe Combined Chiefs could not add anything now to evaluationof this aspect of the matter.The second matter in which I ask your co-operation isin connection with the work required for the re-examination.While many of the data already assembled here can be of use inthe further examination proposed by Mr. Hoffman, he considersit imperative,  in discharging his responsibility to Congress,  toobtain additional information.      It is earnestly hoped  that- itscollection end evaluation will not require more than ninety days,provided they can be started as soon as possible.      To  the extent that your representatives in the British Zone in Germany can make available their assistance,  the time required for the re-examination can be very materially shortened.
I think it might be useful if, following our conversation of September 28th, I were to set down somesuggestions as to how we might proceed in the matter of reparations from Germany.I fully understand the obligation which Section 11I3Fof the Economic Co-operation Act places upon Mr. Hoffman andyourself, and I.am anxious to give you every possible assistancein hastening a solution of this problem.   At -the same time, youwill understand the great importance which I attach to avoiding any step which has a perceptible effect on the rate of dismant-ling in Germany and which consequently would in my view endanger the whole reparations programme.As regards dismantling.    I am advised that the presentposition is as follows.    There are 176 plants in the british zone which have not yet been released from consideration by theUnited States Government.    Of these, 37 have been completelydismantled.&apos;   The total tonnage of these plants is,  however, only about 13.000 tons-.    Ik- plants are in the process of beingdismantled.    I consider that if dismantling were interrupted onthese plants it might well be impossible ever to resume andthat the consequences, would not, be confined to the particularplants in question.    There remain 6I4 plants at which dismantling-has not yet started, but it is due to begin at a number of thesewithin the next few weeks.The arrangements which I would propose for your consideration are as followss-(l)    In connection with the re-examination of theinformation about unreleased plants in the british zone which Mr. Hoffman finds it necessary to undertakein order to discharge his responsibilities to congress, I shall be glad to arrange for anyquestionnaires to be completed by United kingdom representatives in the Bizone.    I believe that itwould also be useful to have an early discussion withthose specially   concerned on the United States sideeither in London or Paris with a view to reaching agreement as soon as possible on which plants,   if any,should be retained in Germany in the interest of theEuropean Recovery Programme.   The sooner we can agree on a precise policy in this respect the sooner will the present uncertainty, which I regard as a seriousobstacle to the execution of the reparations programme,be. removed.(2)    I am ready to arrange that no new dismantling shallbegin at any of the Gi\. plants mentioned above where-it has not yet started until December 15th,    I would hope that the examination will have been complete and inter--Governmental agreement reached by that date.I am afraid that I cannot offer to delay any newdismantling beyond that date because to do so would,I believe, have serious effects on the reparationsprogramme.(3) Equally, I am afraid that I cannot offer to stop orto interrupt .dismantling at any of the plants whereit has already begun.    If,  however,   agreed decisionsANNEX 101COPY OP LETTER ADDRESSED TO MR. MARSHALL BYMR.  BEVIN IN PARIS,  1st OCTOBER,  19U-Q
about retention can be taken quickly I do not exclude the possibility that certain of theseplants should be retained.- provided, dismantlinghas not&apos; gone too far at the time when the decision is taken.(k)    I would ask that a further substantial list of plants be released for allocation very soon,including those already dismantled or in whichdismantling has reached an advanced stage and whichare not considered of the&quot; highest priority from anE.R.P. point of view.    I believe that it is essentialto declare a further list of plants available for allocation in the near future both in order tosatisfy our friends in the Inter-Allied ReparationA.gency, and in order to make it clear to the Germansthat our reparations policy is being substantiallymaintained.(5)    I would ask that no investigation by United Statesexperts should be conducted, in the British Zoneuntil such a declaration of further plants for allocation has been made.(6)   With the same thoughts in mind I would urge that apublic statement in terras to be agreed between usshould be made as soon as possible explaining the limited scope and temporary character of the examination proposed.    This I believe necessary inorder to avoid misunderstanding in Germany which isalready having its effect on the execution of the dismantling programme in the British Zone.I earnestly hope that arrangements on the above lineswill be acceptable to your Government.    In the view of my government they offer a practicable means of reconciling/the responsibilities of/ your Government under the EconomicGo-operation Act with the need.for a rapid completion of the reparations programme.
ANNEX &apos;DTRECORD OF DISCUSSION,  13TH october the reparations and dismantling programme of theBritish Zone has hitherto been operated on a basis of agreement in connection with the level of industry and in co-operationwith the other Governments concerned.    The U.S. Governmenthave requested a reconsideration of&quot; this&apos; programme in the lightof the European Recovery Programme and have accordinglyappointed a committee,  called the Humphrey Committee,  to investigate certain plants in the three Zones, to determine whether or not they would bo better operated in Germany inconnection with the recovery programme or should be dismantled,and removed elsewhere.   Accordingly they have requested that.the British Govoi iment should, so for as their Zone is concerned,co-operate fully with the Humphrey Committee, with a view tofacilitating its work of investigation both in the British zone and elsewhere into the possibility of retaining in Germany,in the interests of E.R.P. plants at present scheduled for reparations.   Tho committee will be asked to maintain close contact with British representatives as its work progresses.2. Thojr have further requested that continued dismantlingin the British Zone will be of such a character as will not prevent the eventual retention in Germany in the interests ofE.R.P. of any plants under review by the Humphrey Committeeexcluding those already allocated by I.A.R.A.3. MR. HOFFMAN will urge the Humphrey Committee to give priority in their examination to the plants on which dismantlinghas already started.h. MR. HOFFMAN will further urge the Humphrey Committeeto give early attention to preparing a list of plants in which,they have no further interest in order that such plants can bemade available to I.A.R.A. for allocation.5. Before any examination of plants is conducted in theBritish Zone a Press statement will be issued in agreed terrasexplaining the nature of the investigation,  emphasising itslimited scope and duration and the fact that,  subject to itsfindings,  the reparations programme is unaffected and will bobrought to as speedy conclusion as possible.6. The Foreign Secretary undertook to examine thetechnical implications of these proposals,  to submit themto the Cabinet, to consult with the French Government and to notify the U*S. Government of its position at an early, date.
