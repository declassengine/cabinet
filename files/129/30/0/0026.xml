(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET COPY NO.1 fcp^^s), ,256 ;5th November, 19U8.CABINETAMENDMENT OF THE BETTING LAWSMemorandum &quot;by the Chancellor of the exchequer in my Budget Speech on 6th April, 191+8,  I said thatI was considering with the Home Secretary the question ofthe amendment of the laws covering betting and gambling.Looking at the matter first from the point of viewof taxation9 the betting tax is at present confined tofootball pools and greyhound tracks, where totalisatorsoperate, but does not touch horse-racing.      This unsatis-fa-factory position, which looks like favouritism to the wealthiermanrs sport, is,  however, inevitable so long as there is aconsiderable volume of illegal street betting.Apart from the taxation aspect,  the betting laws are quite chaotic and illogical.      Thus, it is illegal to resort to premises to bet or to send cash bets by post, but it islawful to bet by credit provided there is. no resorting.Again, the gaming laws are embodied in a confusing set ofenactments which date back to the sixteenth century, andconsolidation is badly needed.It is true that these matters were enquired into bya Royal Commission in 1932-33, which carried out a thoroughenquiry and made a number of useful recommendations.Nevertheless, I am satisfied that it would.be a mistake toproceed to legislation without a further enquiry,  for thefollowing reasons.First, football pools, which were in their infancywhen the Royal Commission reported,  have since increasedenormously;    it is now estimated that they have 9 millionclients.Secondly, it was the intention of the Betting andLotteries Act, 193U., based on the Royal Commission&apos;s Report,to limit the number of days on which greyhound racing could take place to 10h in the year,  the days being uniform throughouteach area.      But the number and disposition of tracks is such that in areas like London and Yorkshire it is possible to attendgreyhound racing every week-day.Finally,  I think that there -have been great changesin public opinion in this matter In the last fifteen years,* and I believe that there will be less opposition to-day than* previously on the part of the Churches to some attempt tograpple with this thorny subject.For these reasons I am in favour of the appointment ofI a Royal Commission with wide terms of reference to recommendwhat amendment should be made in the lows affecting betting,gaming and lotteries.R.S.C.Treasury Chambers,  S.W.1.5th November,  191+8.
