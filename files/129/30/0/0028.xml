THIS  DOCUMENT IS   THE PROPERTY OF HIS   BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTEIRE&apos;S RELATIONS WITH THE COMMONWEALTHaccoxint of the meeting with elre ministers at chequers on sunday,17th October, 1948Ministers representing the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and NewZealand met at Chequers on Sunday, 17th October, to discuss with Eire ministers the practical&apos;consequences which would follow from the repeal of the EireExecutive Authority (External Relations) Act, 1936. Eire was represented atthis meeting by Mr. Sean MacBride, Minister of External Affairs, and Mr. PatrickMcGilligan, Minister of Finance. The other Commonwealth countries were represented by Mr. Attlee, Lord Jowitt and Mr. Noel-Baker (United Kingdom),Mr. St. Laurent (Canada), Mr. Fraser (New Zealand), and Dr. Evatt (Australia).The Secretary of the United Kingdom Cabinet and Mr. Attlee&apos;s Private Secretarywere also present. -The meeting was friendly and informal in character. Both the Eire ministers were personally known to Mr. Attlee, Lord Jowitt and Dr. Evatt, all of whom had recently met them in Ireland. They arrived at Chequers shortly before 1 p.m.;and the discussion of the constitutional problem began immediately after luncheon.Mr. ATTLEE opened the discussion by explaining that he and the Ministersrepresenting Canada, Australia and New Zealand at the Commonwealth meetingnow being held in London had had some informal talk together about the declaredintention of this Eire Government to repeal the External Relations Act; and theyhad all thought it would be advantageous if the representatives of those fourCommonwealth,- countries, whose populations included a substantial number of people of Irish descent, could together discuss with representatives of the eire government the practical consequences which would follow upon the repeal ofthat Act. He had therefore invited the Eire Government to send representativesover to meet informally and discuss the situation with Ministers representingthe United Kingdom, .Canada, Australia and. New Zealand; and he was very glad to welcome Mr. MacBride and Mr. McGilligan for this purpose. Thismeeting had not been suggested with any idea of putting pressure on the eire government to remain within the Commonwealth. But the repeal of the external relations Act seemed likely to have serious consequences upon the relations of eire, not only with the United Kingdom, but with other Commonwealth countries;and it had seemed right that representatives of the countries most directly concerned should meet together.to, discuss those consequences and to examine thesituation as a whole. He was advised that, once the External Relations Act wasrepealed, Eire would become a foreign State in relation to the United Kingdomand the other countries of the Commonwealth;, and those countries might find itimpossible to refrain from treating Eire as a foreign country and her citizens asaliens. He did not wish to imply that this action, if it had to be taken, wouldbe taken out of hostility towards Eire : it might well be forced upon the other commonwealth countries by the treaty -obligations which they had undertaken in&quot; most-favoured-nation clauses in commercial treaties. All commonwealth countries, in varying degrees, had undertaken to accord &quot; most-favoured-nation &quot;treatment to the citizens of various foreign countries; and, if Eire became aforeign State, any of those foreign countries might claim that they and their nationals should enjoy any special benefits or privileges which were accorded in commonwealth countries to Eire or her citizens. This claim might well be madein respect of trade preferences. It was. true that, in the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade under the Charter of the International Trade Organisation,trade preferences, involving some derogation from the general rule &quot;of &quot;most-favoured-nation&quot; treatment, were admitted on the basis, not of commonwealth membership, but of a schedule of named countries including Eire; and this would afford grounds for resisting any claim to equal treatment with Eire made by aforeign State which was a signatory of the General Agreement. But the claimmight be made before that Agreement had entered into force; and, more important,there were countries which did not intend to subscribe to the Agreement.Argentina was one such country, and she had a direct interest in challengingtrade preferences between Eire and the United Kingdom. If that challenge were36085 -   - -       , -r
made it might be necessary for the United Kingdom Government either to suspend the Greater part of the United Kingdom tariff or to withdraw preferential treatment from Eire. The United Kingdom would also be taking a serious riskif she continued to exempt Eire citizens from aliens restrictions after Eire had become a foreign State. For, under &quot;most-favoured-nation&quot; clauses, other foreign countries could claim that their nationals should receive in the UnitedKingdom no less favourable treatment than Eire citizens; and, if that claimwere made and established, the whole basis of aliens control in the United kingdom would be undermined. If, therefore, Eire became a foreign State, the UnitedKingdom Government might feel obliged to withdraw the special concessionsgranted to Eire citizens under Sections 2 and 3 of the British Nationality Act,1948, as a result of which they were now given the status of British subjects inthe United Kingdom.These, Mr. Attlee said, were some of the practical difficulties which seemed likely to arise if Eire became a foreign State; and he had thought it expedient thatthese questions should be discussed in a friendly manner with a view to seeinghow they might be handled.Mr. MacBRIDE said that he wished to make it clear at the outset that itwas not in any sense of hostility that the Eire Government had decided to repealtheir External Relations Act. On the contrary, it was their belief that the repeal of that Act was a necessary preliminary to the restoration of friendly relationsbetween Eire and the United Kingdom. To public opinion in Ireland that Act,and the connection with the Crown which it perpetuated, were irritants which prevented the growth of friendly relations between the two peoples. In Englandand in some of the other Commonwealth countries there was a strong sentimentalattachment to the Crown based on national sentiment and history. In Ireland,on the other hand, there was a long history of struggle for freedom from externalrestraints of which the British Crown was the symbol. The retention of anyconnection with the Crown would be a continuing source of friction between thetwo countries. The present Government of Eire were most anxious to promoteclose and friendly relations between Eire and the United Kingdom, and betweenEire and the other countries of the Commonwealth; and they were convincedthat this closer co-operation would be assisted by the repeal of the external relations Act and the removal of the last constitutional form which was regarded by public opinion in Eire as implying subordination to the United Kingdom.Mr. MacBride said that his Government were anxious to develop friendlierrelations with the United Kingdom and with the other countries of the Common-wealth; but they wished those relations to be based on close association in prac-tical matters of mutual advantage and not on constitutional forms implyingdependence or limitation of sovereignty. He was not concerned to deny that,when the External Relations Act had been repealed, Eire would cease to be amember of the Commonwealth. Indeed, it was the view of his Government thatEire had already ceased to be a member of the Commonwealth probably sincethe enactment of her new Constitution in 1937. If, however, the United Kingdomand the other Commonwealth countries wished to preserve a close and friendlyassociation with Eire, he believed that means could be found to overcome thedifficulties, to which Mr. Att^e had referred, arising from &quot;most-favoured nation &quot; clauses. At the present time Eire citizens had the same rights as Britishsubjects in the United Kingdom; and British subjects were exempted in Eirefrom the restrictions applicable to aliens. His Government were quite ready tosee this position, and the existing trade preferences, continued after the repeal of the External Relations Act; and he believed that a special kind of associationcould be established between Eire and the other countries of the Commonwealth,based on the reciprocal exchange of trade preferences and citizenship rights.With goodwill between the Governments, and by the exercise of ingenuity,&quot; this special association could surely be expressed in such a way as to enable Common-wealth Governments to resist successfully any claim by third parties based on&quot; most-favoured-nation &quot; clauses.Mr. FRASER said that he was most anxious that some means should befound of enabling Eire to preserve a connection with the United Kingdom andthe other countries of the Commonwealth. It would be most unfortunate if, atthis stage in the world&apos;s history, Eire became a foreign State in relation to theCommonwealth countries. Such a development would certainly be most unwelcome to the people of New Zealand. There were in New Zealand large numbers of people of Irish descent who would be following these developments with great anxiety; and the Government of New Zealand would be greatly embarrassed if
they were placed in the position of having to treat Eire as a foreign country.Parliament and public opinion in New Zealand would look to him to do his utmost to prevent any final rupture of the link connecting Eire with the Common-wealth; and it was the duty of the Commonwealth Ministers now meeting inLondon to use all their ingenuity to find means of keeping Eire in close and friendly association with the Commonwealth group.Dr. EVATT endorsed the views expressed by Mr. Fraser. The Irish peoplehad played a significant part in the development of the Commonwealth, and the populations of all the self-governing countries of the Commonwealth included asubstantial number of people of Irish descent. In Australia the Prime minister himself was of Irish descent, and there was a substantial Irish vote. It would beimpossible for Ireland to sever her factual association with the Commonwealth,and every effort ought to be made to find some means, acceptable to Irish publicopinion, of preserving a constitutional link between Eire and the Commonwealthpeoples. He would not regret the repeal of the External Relations Act; for thiswas an unsatisfactory Act &quot;expressed in terms which could afford little gratifica-tion to the other Governments of the Commonwealth; but he hoped that no effort would be spared in finding some other and more satisfactory means of linkingEire with the Commonwealth.Mr. St. LAURENT said that he could understand how the Irish approach tothese constitutional questions differed, because of their different history and tradi-tions, from that of many Commonwealth peoples. For in Canada there was a sub-stantial French-speaking population which could not be expected to have the samefeelings of respect and affection for the Crown as were entertained by Canadians ofBritish descent. At the same time he thought it would be most unfortunate ifEire severed on this account all connection with the Commonwealth. And itwould certainly be politically embarrassing for him if this happened at a timewhen he, a French Canadian, was assuming the leadership of the canadian government. There were vocal sections of political opinion in Canada which were very jealous of the Commonwealth connection, and he would be strongly pressed to say what he had done on Canada&apos;s behalf to prevent this development. for himself., he earnestly hoped that some means might be found of enabling Eireto continue in friendly association with Commonwealth countries.A general discussion ensued in the course of which the following points weremade : (a) THE LORD CHANCELLOR amplified Mr. Attlee&apos;s original statement on the &quot; most-favoured-nation &quot; position. If Eire repealed the External relations act, the question whether Commonwealth countries should treat her as a foreign state Avould not rest wholly in the discretion of those Commonwealth countries:their hand might well be forced by the action of third parties with rights under&quot;most-favoured-nation.&quot; clauses. It thus became important to consider whatforeign countries had an interest in challenging any special facilities which commonwealth countries might wish to continue to extend to Eire and hercitizens, and what prospect there was that such a challenge would succeed inan international court. The responsible Departments of the United KingdomGovernment believed that there was a grave risk, indeed almost a certainty, of sucha challenge being made and a strong probability that it would succeed.(&amp;) Mr. MacBRIDE suggested that, even after the External Relations Acthad been repealed, it would be possible to maintain that there was a special kindof association between Eire and the Commonwealth countries which differentiatedtheir relationship from that of foreign States. The trade preferences, and thearrangements by which Eire citizens were treated on the same basis as Britishsubjects in the United Kingdom and British subjects were exempted from aliensrestrictions in Eire, could surely be pleaded as evidence of such a special relationship. The Eire Government would continue to maintain that there wasa special association based on the reciprocal exchange of trade preferences andcitizenship rights; and he believed that any challenge by a third party, basedon &quot;most-favoured-nation&quot; clauses, could be successfully resisted by referenceto this factual relationship.(c)   THE LORD CHANCELLOR, and other Commonwealth Ministers,argued that, in order to substantiate the claim that Eire and the commonwealth countries were not foreign to one another, it might not be enough to point merely to de facto treatment and concessions granted to British subjects as a matter of36085 b 2
contract or at the discretion of the Eire Government. What was required, inorder to establish a constitutional link, was (in Mr, MacBride&apos;s own words) somereciprocal exchange of citizenship rights. At present British subjects were aliensin Eire, in the contemplation of Eire law; and were granted, by the grace of the eire Government, exemption from the restrictions applicable to aliens. In orderto establish a constitutional link, it was desirable that British subjects shouldhave, as of right, a status in Eire different from that of the nationals of foreigncountries. Would it be possible for Eire to enact a new citizenship law providing that Eire citizens should be regarded as &quot;&apos; Commonwealth citizens &quot; within thescheme of the British Nationality Act passed by the Parliament at Westminsterin 1948 ? Sections 2 and 3 of that Act could then be repealed, and Eire could beadded to the countries listed in Section 1. Alternatively, if that were notpolitically practicable, would it be possible for Eire to pass a citizenship lawgiving to Commonwealth citizens in Eire the same rights and privileges as wereaccorded to Eire citizens in the United Kingdom by Sections 2 and 3 of theBritish Nationality Act, 1948 ?(d) Mr. McGILLIGAN said that the concession by which British subjectswere exempted from aliens restrictions in Eire was made under an article of the eire Aliens Order which provided that such treatment might be accorded to the nationals of any country which afforded corresponding treatment to Eire citizens.The concession was therefore on a de facto basis. There was, however, a provision in the Eire citizenship law which authorised concessions to the nationals of any country whose nationality legislation made special provision for Eire&apos;s citizens;and it was conceivable that under this provision some arrangement might be made which would have the effect of according some special privileges to Britishsubjects in Eire as of right.Mr. MacBRIDE said that the Eire citizenship law was unsatisfactory invarious respects and needed extensive amendment. He did not exclude the possi-bility that a new citizenship law might be introduced in the fairly near future and that opportunity might then be taken to introduce into it provisions according-special rights, on a reciprocal basis, to British subjects or Commonwealth citizens.Mr, MacBride made it clear, however, that it would be politically impossiblefor his Government to repeal the External Relations Act and immediately there-after to introduce new citizenship legislation designed to provide an alternativeconstitutional link with the Commonwealth. His Government were determined tosever their connection with the Commonwealth through the Crown, and they werenot prepared to establish, almost in the same breath, a new connection based on adifferent constitutional link. Such a step might seem to have been forced upon them by the United Kingdom Government or to savour of a bargain with thatGovernment. If, therefore, there was any question of Eire&apos;s re-entering theCommonwealth on some new basis not involving a link through the Crown, this could be only after an interval say, of three to six months and, even then, wouldhave to be almost incidental to a revision of the Eire citizenship law undertaken,not for this special purpose only, but on its merits.(e) Dr. EVATT asked whether it would be possible for the Eire Government,even thougn they had repealed the External Relations Act, to continue to invitethe King to accredit their diplomatic representatives in foreign countries.Mr. MacBRIDE said that this would be out of the question.(/) Mr. ATTLEE said that the Eire Ministers seemed to be contemplatinga special sort of relationship in which Eire would be neither a member of theCommonwealth nor a foreign State, but would remain in some intermediateposition between the two. While he appreciated the desire of the Eire Govern-ment to remain in the most friendly association with the Commonwealth countries,he thought it would be difficult to define the kind of intermediate position whichthey wished to occupy. And it would not be possible to avoid defining the relation-ship. As soon as the External Relations Act had been repealed he would at once be asked in the Parliament at Westminster whether Eire continued to be a memberof the Commonwealth or whether she had become a foreign State. Similar ques-tions would be asked in other Commonwealth Parliaments. These would have tobe answered. He was advised that, in law, Eire would then be in the position of aforeign State in relation to the other Commonwealth countries; and, if he said so,questions would at once be raised about aliens restrictions, trade preferences andall the other matters which involved the &quot;most-favoured-nation&quot; position.Mr. MacBRIDE said that it was not the desire of his Government to treatCommonwealth countries on the same basis as foreign States; and he wondered whether some of the consequences to which Mr. Attlee had earlier referred might
be avoided by a public declaration that Eire and the Governments of Common-wealth countries did not regard one another as &quot;foreign&quot; States. Such adeclaration might be made through an exchange of notes, drafted with a view to publication.At the conclusion of the discussion Mr. MacBride said that he could not leave without referring to the question of partition. He had not come to Chequersto raise that issue and did not wish to invite discussion of it. He realised thatMr. Attlee would not think it appropriate to have that matter discussed on thepresent occasion United Kingdom Governments had never found any occasionappropriate for discussing partition. But he thought it would be wrong for himto leave without saying that it was the earnest desire of his Government to endpartition in Ireland and it was their view that some occasion would have to befound, in the not too distant future, on which it would be thought appropriate to discuss it.The conversation having been exploratory in nature, no attempt was made toreach concrete decisions. But the conversation ended on the understanding thatthe Eire Ministers would consider the practical difficulties which had been put before them; the possibility that Eire might, after an interval, re-enter the Com-commonwealth on some basis (e.g., common citizenship) not involving any connectionwith the Crown; and the suggestion that, meanwhile, there might be some public declaration that Eire and the countries of the Commonwealth did not regard one another as &quot; foreign &quot; States.
