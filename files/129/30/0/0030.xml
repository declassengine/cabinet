DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET* C.P.(kS)  2606TH NOVEivIBETR.  19U8CABINETGERMANY;    BERLIN ELECTIONSMemorandum by the Secretaryof State for Foreign affairs am circulating to my colleagues, as an annex to thismemorandum, a paper on the subject of the Berlin municipalelections due to be held on 5th December.As the paper shows,  the Soviet authorities have made their approval of these elections dependent on the fulfil-ment of a number of unacceptable conditions.   The non-Communist parties are, however, determined to hold theseelections in spite of the Soviet attitude.    If the Berlinauthorities are not to be forbidden to hold the elections,the risk has to be taken that elections in the western sectors only will bring about the final division of theadministration in Berlin and an exacerbation of relationswith the Soviet Government.I. am, however,  of opinion that we must face this riskin the conviction that it is the&apos;duty of the Western allies to give all possible support to the non-Communist parties,and in particular to the Social Democrat party, who areploying a leading part in Berlin in the struggle to maintainthe freedom and independence of the city and. its inhabitants.E .B .Foreign Office, S.W.I.,6th November, 1948.-    155COPY NO.0 (
ANNEXBERLIN ELECTIONS1&apos; Under the Provisional Constitution of Berlin dated july,  1946;,  the City Assembly and magistrate were elected for aperiod of two years, and were to remain in office until a newelection had been held.    The two-year term of office of theAssembly and magistrate came to an end on 20th October.2. The City Assembly originally decided to hold electionson 24th October, but as a result of the delays in handling theelection arrangements and Russian obstruction in the Sovietsector of Berlin,  the dote was postponed until 5th December.3* The Soviet authorities and the Socialist Unity Party(Communists) have from the outset been hostile to the proposalto hold elections in Berlin.    Their campaign against the BerlinCity authorities has been based on the contention that thosearc no longer representative of the wishes of the people.    free elections would undoubtedly result in a resounding victory forthe non-Communist parties and would thus, destroy the basis ofthe Russian case against the Berlin City authorities.    Theunpopularity of the Russians and of their Communist toolsin Berlin would bo made manifest throughout Germany and to theworld at large.    The Russians, however,  have not openlyrejected the proposal, to hold elections.   General Kotikov,  thoSoviet Commandant in Berlin,  in his letter to the Lord Mayorof 20th October,  stated that elections could be held throughoutthe City on 5th December, providing certain conditions were carried out.    An analysis of these conditions mokes it clear,however,  that they are so clearly unacceptable as to amount in fact to a refusal.    For example:-(a) Permission was demanded for the Free German TradeUnion Organisation (F.D.G.B.) to re-form in the Western sectors.We did not ban this Organisation in the British sector, butrecognised the Independent Trade Union Organisation (u.G.0.)which was formed by the non-Communist trade unionists in protest against the dictatorial methods of the Communist-dominatedF.D.G.B.    The T.U.C fully approve of our policy on this matter.Agreement to this Soviet request would therefore bring intoquestion our support of the Independent Trade Union Organisation.The F.-D.G.B. has been banned in the United States sector.(b) The demand was made that militarist and Fascistpropaganda in the Press must stop and war-mongers must be struck off the electoral lists.   Since the leading members ofthe non-Communist parties and the editors of almost all Western-licensed Berlin newspapers have appeared on a black-listproduced by the Soviet-sponsored !,&apos;Anti-war-mongering Committee15,it is clear that acceptance of this demand would mean the prior elimination of a large number of the opponents toCommunists and would reduce the elections to a farce.(c) It was demanded that the unity of the City Administration,and particularly of the police, must be restored after thelatter has been purged of Fascist and militarist elements.The unity of the City&apos;s Administration is already gravely-endangered as a result of the obstruction and terrorisation bythe Comraunists with Soviet approval of the Administration in theSoviet sector.   As regards the police it became necessary forthe magistrate to suspend the Chief of police when it was found.
that the latter obeyed the orders not of the magistrate, but ofthe Soviet authorities only.    The Chief of Police refused toaccept his. suspension and a division of authority arosebetween himself and his legally-appointed acting successor.The police in the Soviet sector has been ruthlessly purgedof non-Communists and. in particular all Social Democrats.The purge of Fascist and militarist elements in the policedemanded by the Soviet authorities would therefore amount tothe establishment of a Commuiiist-dominated police force forthe whole of Berlin.    The events in Czechoslovakia lastFebruary show only too clearly the meaning of this demand.^* The reaction of the leaders of all the non-Communistparties in Berlin to General Kotikov&apos;s letter was immediate and unequivocal.   Although they believed that it amounted toa virtual ban on the holding of elections in the Soviet sector,they re-affirmed their will to hold elections on 5th December.5. When this question of elections first arose, myoriginal feeling was that, in order to avoid any provocativeor aggressive action in Berlin, we should either allowelections for the whole of Berlin or else arrange that thepresent City Council should carry on as a caretaker Government.It soon became -evident, however, that the Germans felt bound by their Constitution, to hold these elections, even if this were only possible in the Western sectors, fearing that thepresent City Council, if it remained in office beyond itslegal term, would be pronounced by the Communists to beunconstitutional and unrepresentative.    In view of the deter-mined and unanimous attitude of all the non-Communist parties the British and. United States authorities in Berlin have represented that it would be impolitic to attempt to preventthese elections even if they were limited to the Western sectorsonly.    It is true that the Soviet authorities are almost certain to declare the new City Council unconstitutional, and.will probably set up a Communist-dominated Council of theirown nomination in their own sector.   This will mean the finaldivision of the City Administration.   It may cause incidentsand it will certainly aggravate relations between the russians and the Western Allies at a time when we are most anxious toreach a settlement over the problem of Berlin.6. If by forbidding the holding of elections I -were able to prevent this split in the Berlin Administration and toheal the breach between the Communist and non-Communist parties,I would be in favour.of taking this step.   All the evidence inmy possession shows, however,  that the Soviet authorities are determined to undermine and destroy the authority of thepopularly-elected legal Administration and to replace it byone of their own nomination.    Thes^ will, I fear, persist inthis aim whether elections are held or not.1* As I have said before, I have also to consider theeffect that the prohibition of these elections would have onthe non-Communist population v/ho represent,  I believe, ninetyper cent, of the inhabitants,  and who up to now have shownconsiderable courage and skill in dealing with the present difficulties.    They would, I have no doubt,  interpret this stopas a sign of weakness,  and their resentment and. loss of moralewould be very great.    If we lose the confidence and support ofthe Berlin population, which we now enjoy, our presence inBerlin will become intolerable and also pointless.
So In these circumstances I have come to theconclusion that to allow these elections to be held inaccordance with, normal democratic procedure and with thearrangements already made &quot;by the out-going City council of berlin is a vital part of our ease for maintaining ourposition in Berlin.    In spite of the risk of trouble beingcaused, I do not think we should be justified in interferinggo prevent the holding of these legally authorised elections.Moreover,  if we give way to Soviet pressure on this issue weshall not only betray the non-Goriiraunist population of Berlin,who look to-us for support, but we shall weaken our Y/holeposition in the city and in any future negotiations with theRussians over the question of Berlin.9, I therefore ask my colleagues to agree that theelections which it is planned to hold in Berlin on th December should not be stopped,10. If my colleagues concur in this policy,  I think that full publicity on the lines of this paper should be given tothe whole question of these elections and to the reasons whythe conditions imposed by the Russians are not acceptable,  sothat our people and the world at large .be made aware of the issues at stake.
