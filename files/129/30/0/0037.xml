&apos;    224DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (48) 26712TH NOVEMBER,  1948CABINETINQUIRY INT0 CAPITAL punishment memorandum by the Home Secretary and theSecretary of State for scotland the Cabinet on 8th November (C. M. (48) 69th Conclusions)invited us to submit draft terms of reference for an inquiry into capital punishment by a Royal Commissions which would notembrace the general question of the total abolition of capital punishment.      The Cabinet also agreed that the Home secretary might take informal soundings with a view to assuring himself that.some of - those whom he had in mind as members of theproposed Royal Commission would be prepared to serve, and asked us to submit an appreciation of the prospects ofsecuring, for such a limited inquiry, the services of individuals whose views would command public confidence.2. A question has now been put.down by Mr. Wilson Harrisfor answer on Thursday, 18th November, in the following terms:-&quot;To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department,whether he has yet arranged for an inquiry into thepossibility of some mitigation of the capital penalty&quot;.It would,  in our view, be insufficient to answer this question by saying that the matter is under consideration, since thequestion is likely to be pressed, in view of the HomeSecretary1s recent decision not to advise interference in twocapital cases, and it would be most undesirable to give any impression that the Government are delaying further action, or are taking action under pressure.     We suggest, therefore,  I hatthe reply to this question should announce the intention of theGovernment to set up a Royal Commission,  and state the terms ofreference of the Royal Commission.3. It has not been possible in the time available to takethe informal soundings suggested by the Cabinet in regard to thepersons whom the Home Secretary had it in mind to invite toserve on the Commission, but at the Home Secretary&apos;s request,the Lord Chancellor has written to the Master of the Roils to inquire whether he or Lord Justice Tucker would be prepared, ifinvited, to accept the Chairmanship of the Royal Commission.It -would in any event, we feel, be desirable that the person whois to be appointed as Chairman should be consulted about themembers whom it is proposed to appoint to the Commission.    Wetherefore suggest that&quot;the reply to the Question should state,if the Cabinet approve, that Lord Greene (or Lord JusticeTucker) will be appointed as Chairman, and that the membership of the Commission is still under consideration.COPY NO.
The draft terms of reference proposed in our rnernor-andum of 3rd November (CP. (1+8) 252) have been further con- ,sidered in the light of the discussion at the Cabinet, and we now propose the following revised terms of&apos; reference:-&quot;To inquire and report as to the law and practice in other countries relating to capital punishment andthe penalties which have been substituted for capital punishment, and to consider and report whether liability to suffer capital punishment for offences against the criminal law of this country should be limited ormodified,  and if so, to what extent and by what means,for how long and under &quot;what conditions persons whowould otherwise have been liable to suffer capital punishment should be detained, and what changes in theexisting law and the prison system would be required&quot;.Under these terms of reference the Royal commission would not be charged with the investigation of the general question of the total abolition of capital&apos;punishment, nor would the imposition of capital punishment in the Armed forces or in Colonial territories overseas corne within its scope.5. In discussion at the Cabinet it was suggested thatthe question to be considered by the Royal Commission should -be whether there was any practicable means of retaining the death penalty only for certain kinds of murder.      If thequestion is put in this way it might be interpreted by theCommission as an invitation to make a further attempt, on thelines of the compromise clause included in the Criminal justice bill, to define certain categories of murder for which the death penalty should be retained..      An approach to theproblem on these lines is not likely to lead- to a satisfactory solution,  and we have therefore thought it preferable to define the main issue with which the Commission will be concerned asthe question whether liability to suffer capital punishment for offences against the criminal law of this country shouldbe limited or modified.6. We ask for the approval of the Cabinet to the revised terms of reference;,  and to a statement being made inreply to the Parliamentary Question on the lines suggested inthis me mo r andum.J. C. E.cabinet Office, ,3.    1.12TH NOVEMBER,  194-8.
