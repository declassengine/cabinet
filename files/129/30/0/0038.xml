(48) 71st Conclusions, Minute 2), of the note to the Eire Government on the repeal of the external relations Act.      This draft was communicated toMr. Fraser, Dr. Evatt and Mr. Pearson on Friday, 12thNovember.(Signed)    NORMAN BROOK.i$inet Office, S. W. 1.13TH NOVEMBER,  1948.
ANNEX   -REVISED DRAFT OF NOTE TO THE EIRE government when Mr. Costello announced in Canada that it was theintention of the Eire Government to procure the repeal of the eire Executive Authority (External Relations) Act, 1936 it seemedto the United Kingdom Government that it would he useful if afrank discussion could take place as to the possible implications of such a repeal.   Subsequently, at the invitation of the UnitedKingdom Government, Mr. MacBride and Mr. McGilligan met at chequers on 17th October with representatives of the UnitedKingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and a preliminary andinformal discussion took place as to the possible implications of the repeal of that Act.   Since that date your aide-memoire ofthe 20th October has been received and considered by the UnitedKingdom Government.The United Kingdom Government have been glad to learn that the Eire Government welcomed the frank and friendly natureof these discussions, and desires to continue close relationship between Eire and the countries of the Commonwealth..   For their part the United Kingdom Government would also greatly welcome the continuance of such a relationship.At the meeting at Chequers it was stated on behalfof the United Kingdom Government that preliminary consideration had been given to the legal implications of the repeal.   since this meeting the United Kingdom Government have obtained formaladvice from the Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers as to theconsequences which would ensue in law if Eire repealed the external Relations Act.   The effect of the advice which has beenreceived may be summarily stated as follows:-The repeal by the Eire Government of the Eire executive authority (External Relations) Act, 1936 would have the resultthat Eire would &quot;become, for the purpose of &quot;most-favoured-nations&quot;treaties, a foreign country.
The most important of the practical consequences whichwould follow is that other foreign countries, v/hose commercial treaties with the United Kingdom include a &quot;most-favoured-nation&quot;clause, would be able to claim, and to make good their claimbefore the International Court of Justice^ that the United kingdom should extend to them and their nationals any special benefits or privileges which the United Kingdom accorded to Eire or hercitizens.    This claim would be made in respect of trade relations and treatment of nationals.As regards trade relations, the United Kingdom hastreaties with a large number of other foreign countries in whichit has undertaken to accord to those countries treatment not less favourable than that accorded to any other foreign country.   IfEire became a foreign state such countries could claim that theyshould be treated -not less favourably than Eire.   The UnitedKingdomi would therefore either have to withdraw trade preferencewhich she now accords to Eire;    or, if she made no change in hertreatment of Eire, the consequence would be that, except for afew protective and revenue duties,  the United Kingdom Governmentcould have virtually no tariff, because every important country would have to be granted the almost universal free entry noy/enjoyed by Eire.    For these reasons it would be difficult toavoid the consequence that the United Kingdom Government would be compelled to take action to terminate its comraitments to accordpreferential treatment in Customs matters to Eire goods.As regard.s the treatment of nationals,  if Eire became aforeign State, any attempt to continue to treat Eire citizens inthe United Kingdom otherwise than as aliens might provoke demands.from numerous foreign countries under their Treaties with theUnited Kingdom that their nationals should enjoy similar privilegesin the United Kingdom.   If such demands were conceded, it wouldbe impossible to operate in anything like its present form thewhole of the United Kingdom system of Aliens Control.    The
United. Kingdom Government would therefore have no alternative but to bring Eire citizens under the ordinary Aliens Controlapplicable to foreign nationals.There are other respects as well in which the specialrelations between the two countries might have to be adjusted totake account of the changed status in terms of internationallaw.The United Kingdom Government think it right toinform the Eire Government at once of the advice which theyhave received as to the legal position and of the difficultieswhich are likely to flow from the repeal of the external relations Act.    If the Eire Government take a different viewof the legal implications of the step which they propose totake, they might think it useful if discussions were arranged between the United Kingdom Government!s legal advisers and any legal advisers whom the Eire Government might desire to appointfor this purpose.      The Lord. Chancellor and the Law officers would willingly take part in any such discussions.
