(48) 24426th October, 1948.CABINETTHE COMMONWEALTH RELATIONSHIPMemorandum by the Prime MinisterEor some time past we have been aware that the new Indian Constitutionmight emerge from the Constituent Assembly in a form not fully consonant withthe preamble to the Statute of Westminster, which describes the members of theCommonwealth as &quot; united by a common allegiance to the Crown.&quot; I therefore thought it advisable to set up, in the summer of last year, a small informal Com-mittee of Ministers to re-examine the nature of the Commonwealth relationshipand to consider on what constitutional basis India might remain within the Com-commonwealth if in the event she were unable to accept the Crown as &apos;&apos; the symbol of free association&apos;&apos; in the Commonwealth. I apprehended that, if this situationarose, we might have to reach a quick decision; and I was anxious that, so faras possible, these difficult issues should have been fully examined and sifted inadvance.This Ministerial Committee was assisted by a small group of officials. Twoof the reports prepared by this group are attached to this memorandum (Annexes Iand II). The broad conclusions reached in these reports were endorsed in the summer of this year by the Ministerial Committee, who invited me to communicatetheir provisional views to the Prime Ministers of Canada, Australia and NewZealand as a basis for the informal discussions which I hoped to have with them at the time of the meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers. I therefore asked the Secretary of the Cabinet to visit those countries on my behalf in August and explain the position to Mr. Mackenzie King, Mr. Chifley and Mr. Eraser. his report of these conversations is also attached (Annex III).
The Ministerial Committee approved the draft statement of general principles set out in the Appendix to that report as a basis for the informal conversations which I proposed to hold with other Prime Ministers during the course of that meeting; and there then seemed to be at least a reasonable chance that these prin-ciples would be endorsed by the representatives of Canada, Australia and NewZealand, As will be seen, the basic assumption was that, for continuing member-ship of the Commonwealth, the minimum constitutional link should be somerecognition of the Crown; but that, if some Commonwealth countries were unableto accept the jurisdiction of the Crown for internal purposes, it would suffice thatthey should accept the King&apos;s jurisdiction in their external relations.2. In the informal conversations held since the opening of the Conference of-Commonwealth Prime Ministers, two major developments have taken place. First,it has been made clear that the present Government of Eire are determined to repeal their External Relations Act and unwilling to put in its place any otherconstitutional link involving any recognition of the Crown. Secondly, it is now known that the new Indian Constitution will provide for the establishment ofIndia as a &quot;sovereign independent republic&quot; and it seems likely that india will not be willing to accept the King&apos;s jurisdiction even for the purpose of herexternal relations.3. The Eire Executive Authority (External Relations) Act, 1936, is the lastconstitutional link binding Eire to the Commonwealth. Within the last fewmonths Eire Ministers have publicly stated that Eire has ceased to be a memberof the Commonwealth; and, when they have carried out their declared intentionof repealing their External Relations Act, it will no longer be practicable for other commonwealth countries to continue to maintain that she is a member of theCommonwealth. It is conceivable that, once she had repealed the external relations Act and severed the last link with the Crown, Eire might, after an interval, be willing to re-enter the Commonwealth on some new basis not involvingany relation to the Crown.4. Indian Ministers, on the other hand, are anxious that India should remain within the Commonwealth, if they can find a constitutional basis whichwill be acceptable to their Constituent Assembly. During the past two weeks Iand some of my colleagues have been discussing with Pandit Nehru the possibilityof devising some satisfactory constitutional link, preferably through the Crown,which would be acceptable to public opinion in India.5. I will explain orally to the Cabinet, when this issue comes before them on 28th October, the latest developments in these conversations, both with eire ministers and with the Prime Minister of India. But I thought it would be useful to those Ministers who have not taken part in our preliminary discussion of theseconstitutional issues over the past twelve months if I circulated in advance someof the documents on which our earlier consideration of these issues was based, andalso this brief indication of the developments which have taken place in the last few weeks.C.

ANNEX I[G.R. (48) 2][21s* May, 1948]CABINETCommittee on Commonwealth RelationsCOMMONWEALTH RELATIONSHIPThird Report by Official committee at their meeting on 12th April (C.R. (48) 1st Meeting, Minute 1) the Minis-terial Committee asked us (i) to consider whether the Commonwealth relationship could be redefined- in such a way as to meet the difficulties of peoples who might be reluctant to accept it in its present form; and(ii) to examine in further detail the practical problems involved in creating a new &quot; Commonwealth of British and Associated Nations &quot;on thelines indicated in our earlier report (C.R. (48) 1).In this report we have addressed ourselves primarily to the first of those requests.I. The Commonwealth Relationship2.   The existing Commonwealth relationship has five essential features-(a) the position of the Crown;(b) common citizenship;(c) economic co-operation;(d) consultation on foreign policy; and(e) collaboration in defence.The last three of these-in many ways the most practical elements in the relation-ship have never been precisely formulated, and it is doubtful whether the rightsand obligations involved under these heads are in fact susceptible of definition.Thus, in matters of defence, it is our hope that in war the self-governingmembers of the Commonwealth will usually be found fighting together on the sameside and never be found fighting on opposite sides. But it is now recognised that a commonwealth country has the right to remain neutral in a conflict affecting the .rest of the Commonwealth, and this right has been exercised in practice by Eire.And in recent months we have faced the possibility hitherto regarded as evenmore unthinkable of war between two members of the Commonwealth. In pre-sent circumstances it would be impossible to define.the Commonwealth relation-ship in defence matters in terms which would be generally acceptable.3.   It would be equally impracticable to frame an acceptable definition ofthe common obligations of Commonwealth countries in matters of foreian policy.The United Kingdom Government have accepted an obligation to consult other36031 b
Commonwealth Governments^ on matters of foreign policy which affect eitherthose Governments individually or Commonwealth interests as a whole, and theOther- Governments of the Commonwealth are expected to follow the same pro-cedure. (There is at present no such consultation with Eire : the practice was suspended by reason of Eire&apos;s neutrality in the.last war, and it has not since been resumed.) This principle of consultation is based on the assumption thatthe main aims of the Commonwealth countries in foreign policy are identical.But it does not imply that there is a common foreign policy to which all Coni-commonwealth countries subscribe. Indeed, the pursuit of an unvaryingly uniformforeign policy by the Commonwealth as a whole is precluded in practice by thelocal differences of attitude and interest which must inevitably arise among the peoples of a Commonwealth widely scattered throughout the world. It would doubtless be possible to redefine the principle of consultation in foreign affairs.But the true nature of our common interests in foreign policy would not be ade-adequately expressed by the mere obligation of consultation. And beyond that itwould not be practicable to go, by way of definition, without appearing to en-croach upon the principle of the independence of individual commonwealth countries.4. Economic co-operation between Commonwealth countries, including Eire,is based partly on formal agreements (such as the tariff arrangements negotiatedat Ottawa in 1932) and partly on &apos;! family ties &apos;&apos; between Governments and between private traders. While these relations are largely based on economic considerations of mutual benefit, they are also influenced in varying degrees byfeelings of mutual sympathy and understanding and a desire to give help when itis needed. Our economic relations with the other countries of the Commonwealthnecessarily vary according to the circumstances and attitude of each and are, bytheir nature, subject to constant change and review. And, to the extent that they take into account considerations other than the purely economic, it would be impracticable either to define the particular facet of the Commonwealth relationwhich they express or to find a formal definition which would be applicablegenerally to all.5. The two remaining features of the relationship are more susceptible of definition.The common citizenship is necessarily the subject of precise legislative defini-tion; and here Commonwealth Governments have recently agreed upon an impor-tant measure of re-definition. The British Nationality Bill, which has been intro-duced into the House of Lords, will give effect in the United Kingdom to the changes agreed upon at a Commonwealth Conference in 1947, and it is assumed that corresponding legislation will be passed by other Commonwealth Parliaments.The essence of this new scheme is that each &quot;Commonwealth country shall by itsown legislation determine who are its citizens,, shall declare these citizens to havethe status of British subjects and shall recognise the citizens of the other commonwealth countries as having that status. The Cabinet have also approved the proposal to. introduce into the Bill the new term &quot; Commonwealth citizen &quot; asan alternative to &quot;British subject&quot; so that the citizens of commonwealth countries which dislike the conception of &apos;&quot;&apos; British subjecthood &quot; may in futuredescribe themselves as &quot; Commonwealth citizens.&quot; And in view of this change,which was proposed in order to meet their wishes, India and Pakistan are content with the general scheme of the Bill. The changes embodied in this Bill willmodify the link of common citizenship. A citizen of another commonwealth country who is not a United Kingdom citizen will not in future be punishablein the United Kingdom courts for an offence committed abroad unless the offenceis one which would be punishable if committed by an alien. This means that a citizen of another Commonwealth country will not in future be punishable here for treason committed abroad and, like an alien, will be punishable for treasoncommitted here only if he had acquired and maintained a local allegiance.   In* This obligation was defined by the Prime Minister in the following statement made in theHouse of Commons on 8th May, 1946:- &quot; It is our practice and our duty as members of the British Commonwealth to keepother members of the Commonwealth fully and continuously informed of all matters whichwe are called upon to decide., but which may affect Commonwealth interests The object isto give them an opportunity of expressing their views in confidence if they so desire.&apos; These. - views are taken fully into account but the decision must be&apos;ours and the other governments are not asked, and would not wish, to share responsibility for it. Dominion Governments&apos; follow the same practice.&quot; .....
future, Commonwealth citizens will owe only (i) allegiance to the Crown in rightof their own country, and (ii) a local allegiance in any1 other Commonwealth;country for acts committed therein. It is arguable, therefore^ that,, as, a: resultof this Bill, the preamble to the Statute of Westminster should in future be inter-preted as meaning that-the various countries of the Commonwealth; are, unitedby a several, rather than a joint, allegiance to the Grown. - -The United Kingdom Bill doesnotdeal with the rights and privileges of Coin-commonwealth citizens in the various Commonwealth countries; but the system by which each Commonwealth country is left to define the rights, and privileges of its owncitizens will make it easier for Commonwealth,Parliaments to reduce the advan-tages afforded by the possession: of Commonwealth citizenship The importanceof this common status will in the long run depend on the willingness of Common-wealth countries not to discriminate too greatly between their own citizens andother Commonwealth citizens. If Commonwealth countries came to accord to commonwealth citizens other than their own citizens privileges which were not substantially greater than those conceded to aliens, the common status would cease to have value or reality.We conclude that there is no scope for any further re-definition of the commoncitizenship element in the Commonwealth relationship, in addition to the impor-tant changes already proposed in the British Nationality Bill.- 6. The position of the Crown in relation to the Commonwealth countries is expressed in the King&apos;s title, which by Proclamation made under the Royaland Parliamentary Titles Act, 1927, is as follows : &quot; George VI by the Grace of God of Great Britain, Ireland and theBritish Dominions beyond the seas King, Defender of the Faith [Emperor.-     of India].&quot;It is further defined in the Preamble of the Statute of Westminster, 1931. in thefollowing terms :     . - ,&quot;.., . . . inasmuch as the Crown is the symbol of the free association of theMembers of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and as they are united, bya common allegiance to the Crown. . . . .&quot;-These underlying ideas are reflected in the position of the Crown in theconstitutions of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and, now, Ceyion.There, as in the United Kingdom, the Executive Government is vested in the King.It is administered, by His Majesty in person or by a Governor-General as his repre-sentative. Ministers are appointed by the Governor-General under authoritydelegated to him by the King. The Royal Assent is given to Bills passed by the legislatures, Members of the Legislature take Oaths of Allegiance; In external affairs, representatives of Commonwealth countries in foreign countries are accredited by Letter of Credence signed by the King: and international agree-ments in Heads of State form are made in the name of the King and- signedunder a full power issued by the King.In Eire, the position was approximately the same until 1936. Since then the King has had no authority in the internal affairs of Eire. For internalpurposes the Head of the State is an elected President, and formal action is takenin the name of the State. The members of the Legislature do not take an Oathof Allegiance to the King. In external affairs, however, Eire continues torecognise the Crown by virtue of Section 3 (I) of the Executive Authority(External Relations) Act, vphich was passed by the Legislature of Eire in 1936 andreads as follows : &quot;It is hereby declared and enacted that, so long as Saorstat Eireann is associated with the following nations, that is to say, Australia, Canada^ GreatBritain, New Zealand, and South Africa, and so long as the king recognised by those nations as the symbol of their co-operation continues to act on behalfof each of those nations (on the advice of the several Governments thereof)for the purposes of the appointment&apos; of diplomatic and consular represen-tatives and the conclusion of international agreements, the king so recognised&apos; may, and is hereby authorised to, act on behalf of Saorstat Eireann for the like purposes as and when advised by the Executive Council so to do.&quot;- But, while the King has these specific&apos;functions under-the constitution of thevarious Commonwealthjcouritrres] the strength of the Crown as: a common link between them all rests rather in the history, tradition and sentiment surroundingthe Throne and the respect and affection in which Their Majesties are held bythe peoples of the Commonwealth.   Fundamentally, the bonds which link the36031
Commonwealth are intangible and undefinable; and the Crown, with its historicalassociations and emotional significance, aptly reflects both the undefinable quality of this relationship and its variable character. The Crown provides the focalpoint to which are directed all the forces making for Commonwealth unity. Butit need not impose any uniformity of relationship it can symbolise for eachCommonwealth country the special position said relationship of that countrv id&quot;the other members of the Commonwealth.7. The foregoing analysis shows that there is little scope for any further re-definition of the existing Commonwealth relationship if by &quot; re-defining.&quot; is meant the framing;of &quot;articles of association&quot; attempting a comprehensivedefinition of the basic principles of the association. The association of the self-governing members of the Commonwealth has hitherto been essentially a looseassociation of independent peoples bound together, not by any formal instrument of partnership, but by the sentiment of a common heritage from the past and thepractical advantages of continuing collaboration in the present. The nature ofthis association has been adapted, by a slow process of evolution, to meet changingneeds; arid it has derived much.of its continuing strength from its avoidance of formal obligations arid precise definitions. We believe that, on this account, itwould be inexpedient to confront the self-governing members of the Commonwealthwith a formal definition of the principles of their association. As we have sought to show, it would be difficult enough to frame a comprehensive definition of thebasis of the existing relationship in terms which would be generally acceptable.It would be even more difficult to devise a &quot; re-definition &quot; on lines which would encourage the continuing association of India and Pakistan without endangeringthe cohesion of the rest of the Commonwealth. We have therefore approachedthis problem of &quot; re-definition &quot; from a somewhat different angle.First, we have considered, without attempting any general re-definition ofxae relationship, whether there are any changes in convention or usage whichwould ease the existing relationship by bringing it more closely into accord withthe current views and outlook of Commonwealth peoples.Secondly, we have sought to determine what are the minimum formal tieswhich a particular country must be willing to accept if it is to remain a memberof the Commonwealth and what changes, if any, would be required in the symbolsof common association in order to regularise the retention in the Commonwealthof one or two countries which could not accept more than these minimum ties.8.   TJrider the first head we make the following recommendations: (a) Some Asiatic peoples would regard membership of a British Common-wealth of Nations as connoting continued subjection to the british people. We suggest that, as a matter of practice, we should in futuredescribe our association as &quot;The Commonwealth of Nations.&quot;This title is, of course, open to criticism as lacking descriptivecontent: it does not describe any geographical area or group of countries. We think, however, that this disadvantage is outweighed by the political arguments in its favour. We believe that official use and, in particular, its incorporation in statutory enactments would lead to its general acceptance throughout the Commonwealth, and itwould in time become understood and accepted in other countries. Itwould not matter if foreign countries continued to add the descriptiveadjective &quot; British &quot; just as other countries spoke of &quot; the GermanReich &quot; while Germans spoke of &quot; the Reich.&quot;(b) It has already been decided to amend the British Nationality Bill toprovide that the term &quot; Commonwealth citizen&quot; may be used as analternative to &quot;British subject.&quot;(c) The term &quot; Dominion &quot; is nowhere popular and is open to misinterpre-tatioii.   We should now press to its logical conclusion the change:      which was made when a &quot; Commonwealth Relations Office &quot;took the..place of the old.&quot; Dominions Office &quot; and suppress entirely all officialuse of the descriptions &quot;Dominion,&quot; &quot;Dominion Government,&quot; &amp;c. Intheir  place,  such expressions  as   &quot;Commonwealth  country&quot;  or,     &quot; Member of the Commonwealth &quot; might be used.  It would be possibleto lay down rules of practice for Government Departments, which.. would, we. hope,.become generally accepted.(d) We should lost no opportunity of stressing the fact that all fully self-governing Commonwealth countries are of equal status,, and that theUnited Kingdom is no -more, than -primus - inter-pares.,&apos; Thus, the term&apos;&apos; Commonwealth Prime Ministers &quot; should in; future be used to
:       ,,j describe the Prime Ministers of all Commonwealth countries, includingthe United Kingdom. - .9. Under the second head, we have assumed that United Kingdom.ministers would be most reluctant to take the initiative in thrusting a particular countryout of the Commonwealth by reason of its unwillingness to accept all the currentobligations of membership. We have also assumed that it is not necessary to change the constitutional relations of all members of the Commonwealth merely because one or two members insist upon a type of relationship which is rather less close than that preferred by the majority. Eire has deviated far from thenormal pattern without formally breaking the Commonwealth connection; and;although this is an extreme example of divergence, it is by no means the case that the relations between all other. Commonwealth countries are in all respects,identical. There is scope for variety in the relations between the different partsof the Commonwealth.10. The practical form in which this issue is likely to arise in the immediatefuture is whether we can agree that India or Pakistan should remain within theCommonwealth even though they adopt forms of constitution which are not fullyconsistent with the preamble to the Statute of Westminster. The british nationality Bill is to be amended to meet their wishes and We assume that thiswill enable them to accept the link of common citizenship. Eor the purpose of thisreport we have also assumed that satisfactory arrangements can be made withthem in matters of economic co-operation, consultation on foreign policy and collaboration in defence. By this we do not imply that there will be no difficultyin arranging those matters; but the difficulty wilt not be of a legal or consti-tutional kind particularly as the rights and obligations of commonwealth countries under these heads have not normally been defined with any precision.The constitutional problem will only become acute if India or Pakistan shows a genuine desire to share in the practical aspects of Commonwealth collaboration &apos;but is unable formally to acknowledge full allegiance to the British CroWn.In that situation our first aim should be to persuade these countries to accept an arrangement by which the Head of the State would be the King&apos;s representa-tive both for internal and external purposes. It is not, however, essential thatthe King&apos;s representative should continue to bear the title &quot;Governor-General.&apos;&apos;India or Pakistan could confer on him whatever titles she chose. And, if sheadopted a &quot; republican &apos;&apos; form of constitution, it would not be impossible for aPresident to exercise the powers now delegated to a Governor-General. It wouldbe preferable in such a case that the President should be nominated by the localGovernment for appointment by the King. It would be more difficult to preserve the position of the Crown if the constitution provided for the election of aPresident. But even that system might be acceptable if it involved no seriousdeparture from the normal status of the King&apos;s representative.11. We must, however, face the possibility that one or both of these states may insist that the King should have no authority in the internal affairs ofthe country. In that event it may still be expedient that, if that country isotherwise prepared to play her full part in the practical aspects of Commonwealthcollaboration, she should be encouraged to remain within the Commonwealth onthe basis of recognising the Crown as the Supreme Head of the commonwealth and accepting the King&apos;s jurisdiction in her external relations. This, if itcould be secured, would be a more satisfactory form of relation than that adopted by Eire in 1936; for it would involve recognition of the Crown as theSupreme Head of the Commonwealth and acceptance of this formal mark of membership of the Commonwealth.12. In order to facilitate the retention of India or Pakistan in the Common-wealth on either of the two bases suggested above, it may be found necessaryto consider whether some change should be made in the King&apos;s title. Asiaticpeoples may be reluctant to profess allegiance to a King of another race. Theymay believe that this would imply a sense of foreign domination inconsistent withtheir attainment of full independence. If this should prove a stumbling-blockfor peoples who, in all other respects, are ready for full collaboration as membersOf the Commonwealth, the situation might be met by conceding the principlethat a self-governing member of the Commonwealth should be free to choosewhether to recognise the King by that title or merely as Head of their country.We doubt, however, whether it would be expedient for the United KingdomGovernment&quot; to take the initiative in raising this, issue, partly because of thepolitical risks involved arid &quot;partly because of the difficulties of finding an
acceptable alternative, title. If this question were raised, Eire would probablyseize the opportunity to re-open the whole question of Eire&apos;s constitutional position and future relationship to the other Commonwealth countries&apos; Theseparatist influences in South Africa might also put forward extreme demands.The cohesion of the older members of the Commonwealth might be prejudiced by the very fact that a change of title was under discussion. Moreover, the choice of an alternative formula,, designed to satisfy such diverse points of view, would present great difficulties. There wOuld be a demand for specific mention ofsome Commonwealth countries in the title : but, if this were accepted, the Irishdifficulty would become acute. If the formula &quot; British Dominions beyond these as &quot; were abandoned, what alternative could be devised which would cover the Colonies ? Is there a risk that the title may become so general as to beemptied of content ?&apos; There is also a risk that any radical change in the position of the Crownmight enable foreign countries to claim for their nationals, by virtue of most-favoured-nation clauses in treaties, the same privileges as are accorded to citizens of other Commonwealth countries. Hitherto each Commonwealth country has succeeded in defending against most-favoured-nation clauses the favoured positiongranted to citizens of other Commonwealth countries as compared with aliens insuch matters as customs duties, &amp;c. One of the practical advantages of retainingcommon status provisions in all Commonwealth nationality Acts is that theywould assist in defending this favoured position; and it may be that this position has already been weakened by the re-definition of common citizenship in the british nationality Bill. A change in the position of the Crown might further prejudice our ability to defend the special privileges of Commonwealth citizens against a challenge based on most-favoured-nation clauses.13. For these reasons we hesitate to recommend that the United KingdomGovernment should take the initiative in proposing any radical change in theKing&apos;s title. But we do not think it safe to assume that this issue can be evadedfor long. It is known, for instance, that the Canadian Government propose to seek an early opportunity of raising it; and the Indian and Pakistan Govern-ments may also do so in the near future. We have therefore considered whatalternative formula might best meet the needs of the situation. We believe that,if any change has to be made, there would be advantage in suggesting theformula : &quot; George VI King by the Grace of God, Head of all countries of theCommonwealth of Nations, and Defender of the Faith.&quot;This formula might make it easier for a &quot;republican&quot; India or Pakistan toremain within the Commonwealth, though there is a risk that they would seedifficulty even in this phraseology. It would also avoid the use of the word&quot;Dominion.&quot; And, as a corollary of the Canadian Citizenship legislation andthe British Nationality Bill, it would concede the principle of the divisibilityof the Crown.14. We offer two further suggestions which are of general applicationthroughout the Commonwealth, though they might be of particular assistance in meeting India&apos;s difficulties.(a) It is not essential that the King&apos;s representative in any commonwealth country should bear the title &quot; Governor-General.&quot; In the situation which wehave envisaged this would be impossible in India or Pakistan; but it might be inexpedient to make a change in respect of India or Pakistan alone. There would,therefore, be advantage in introducing generally a system by which all the self-governing countries of the Comomnwealth should be given discretion to decide by what title the King&apos;s representative in their territory should be known.(b) When the King goes to another Commonwealth country, he assumes in theory all the powers exercised by his representative, although, as a matter of convenience, the Governor-General may continue in practice to perform some ofhis normal duties. It might serve to emphasise the equal status of all self-governing members of the Commonwealth if, in the King&apos;s absence from theUnited Kingdom, his powers in this country were exercised by the next person inthe line of succession to the Throne, as his personal representative, rather than byCounsellors of State. This arrangement would bring the United Kingdom into line with the other self-governing members of the Commonwealth. An amend-ment of the Regency Act would be necessary.15. In concluding this part of our report, we think it right to emphasise the complex and difficult nature of the questions which it raises.   Constitutional
changes of. the kind which we have discussed might have far-reaching effects on thecohesion&apos;, of the Commonwealth. Any precipitate ventilation of these ideas mightjar the harmony of Commonwealth relations and might provoke political con-trbversy in this country. If any advance were to be made on these lines, it wouldbe essential that means should be found for full preliminary consultation with thePrime Ministers of the older members of the Commonwealth and for a free and frank exchange of views with them. It also seems advisable that at the appro-priate stage the leaders of other political parties in this country should be consulted. .II. A &quot; Commonwealth of British and Associated Nations &quot;16. Ministers also asked us to make a detailed examination of the practical problems involved in the creation of a new &quot; Commonwealth of British and Asso-ciated Nations &quot; on the lines indicated in our earlier report.It was our understanding, however&quot;, that Ministers preferred, before considering this alternative, to exhaust the possibilities of finding a solution forthe problems of India and Pakistan within a Commonwealth relationship, and invited us on this account to consider first the possibility of &quot;re-defining&quot; theexisting relationship. We have therefore thought it inadvisable to delay the submission of this part of our report. We can, if desired, complete our detailed examination of the alternative in the light of Ministers&apos; discussion of this report.Signed, on behalf of the Committee,NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,list May, 1948.
ANNEX II[C.R. (48) 4][21** July, 1948]CABINETCommittee on Commonwealth RelationsCOMMONWEALTH RELATIONSHIPFourth Report by Official- Committee    .AT their meeting on 31st May the Ministerial Committee asked us to examinethe practical problems involved in creating a new &quot; Commonwealth of Britishand Associated Nations &quot; on the lines indicated in our Second Report (C.R. (48) 1).I. A &quot;Commonwealth of British and Associated Nations&quot;2. It may be convenient that we should first recall the main advantages and disadvantages of such a conception, which were set out at greater length in our Second Report.Its main advantage is that it would make it possible to maintain unchanged ,the existing relation between those States members of the Commonwealth whichare prepared to accept the common allegiance to the Crown. It would not involvethe disappearance of the word &apos;&apos; British &apos;&apos; from the title of the Commonwealth,a development which is likely to be repugnant to conservative opinion here andin other parts of the Commonwealth. At the same time, it might enable theexisting membership of the Commonwealth to be preserved or even enlarged--by setting the close circle of British nations within the wider framework of a commonwealth which could also include &apos;&apos; associated&apos;&apos; States which could not accept the common allegiance to the Crown. There is a grave risk that someof the non-European peoples of the Commonwealth may find it impossible, in thefirst flush of their independence, to accept the existing constitutional forms ofthe Commonwealth. If on this account India or Pakistan should feel compelledto withdraw from the Commonwealth, its prestige and influence in the world would be seriously impaired. And, internally, the effect might be, not to reinforce the cohesion of the remaining members of the Commonwealth, but to encourage the forces already working in the direction of separation and disintegration.Moreover, it is arguable that a refusal to contemplate some alternative formof association other than that devised in the interests of a group of Britishcommunities is incompatible with the aims of our Colonial policy, which holdsout to peoples who are largely non-European the ultimate goal of self-government within the Commonwealth. Finally, a. Union of Western Europe is unlikely to be powerful enough to stand independent of both the Soviet and Americanblocs unless it has the support of countries outside Europe which are in a specialassociation with its members; and this makes it the more necessary for us atthe present time to explore every means of securing that the Commonwealthshall remain as large and as powerful as possible.3.   On the other hand, there is a serious risk that, if we took the initiative in putting forward proposals for a new form of association on these lines, someof the older Commonwealth countries might prefer the status of an &quot; associatedState,&quot; with the result that the inner and outer groups of the new Commonwealth[36031] ^ c
might be thrown out of balance with each other. The recent change of Govern-ment in South Africa has emphasised the possibility that the Union might prefer to become an &quot; associated &quot; State, and it is not impossible that economic develop-ments might, sooner or later, drive Canada also into the outer ring. The risk that, in taking the initiative in putting forward this proposal, we might start a movement on these lines would be increased by undue emphasis on the &quot; British &quot;character of the inner group of members of the new Commonwealth. If it beassumed that India, Pakistan and Eire would in any event ask for associatemembership, such a movement would clearly so affect the balance between the twoelements in the Commonwealth as fundamentally to alter its character. It seems unlikely that the new CommonAvealth could endure for any length of time in thatform if its main weight came to lie with the &quot; associated &quot; States.4. Among the foregoing considerations for and against the conception of a&quot; Commonwealth of British and Associated Nations&apos;&apos; there are many impon-derables. The difficulties of defining the relation between the &quot;associated&quot;States and the other members of such a Commonwealth are, however, of a more practical nature. It would be necessary to replace the existing constitutional tiesby formal agreements defining the principles and objectives of the association andthe rights and obligations of the associate members. It would not perhaps bedifficult to devise a general statement of principles and objectives which wouldcommend itself to all members of the Commonwealth, whether or not they proposedto opt for associate membership. The difficulty would arise over the attempt to define the rights and obligations of the associate members.5. Common Status. Separatist opinion in the Commonwealth countries islikely to be increasingly concerned with questions of rights and material advan-tages; and, if we are to create a new form of associate membership, we must beprepared to define &quot; rights &quot; in terms of material benefit. But there is a pfe-liminary difficulty viz., would it be possible to devise a form of relation betweenthe &apos;&apos; associated &apos;&apos; States and the British members of the Commonwealth whichcould be clearly differentiated from the relation between foreign States, e.g.,between the United Kingdom and the other signatories of the Brussels Treaty?We had hoped that it might be possible to devise some form of common status,not involving allegiance to the Crown, which could be enjoyed by the citizens of all members of the new Commonwealth. This, if it had been found practicable,, might have provided both a common bond of emotional and psychological value and also an assurance of concrete and tangible benefits for the individual citizens of the &quot; associated &quot; States. Such benefits would in any event have been limited in scope. Commonwealth countries would be unwilling to grant more liberalfacilities in such matters as the franchise, or to relax the existing restrictions onthe entry into their territory of persons who, although they may be citizens ofother Commonwealth countries, do not possess their local citizenship. We are,however, advised that, in the absence of a common constitutional link, such as that provided by allegiance to one Crown, it k unlikely that foreign countries wouldbe willing to recognise any such form of common status. And, as explained inthe next paragraph, its adoption would undermine the existing rights of oneCommonwealth country to confer on the citizens of others privileges not grantedto the nationals of foreign countries. Thus common status would have no morethan a sentimental value.6. Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment. In paragraph 12 of our third report (C.R. (48) 2), we drew attention to the risk that any radical change in theposition of the Crown might enable foreign countries to claim for their nationals,by virtue of most-favoured-nation clauses in treaties, the same privilegesas are accorded to citizens of other CommonAvealth countries. We aresatisfied that such claims could no longer be effectively resisted once the constitutional links binding the &quot; associated&quot; States to the Common-wealth had been broken. We are advised that there is no prospect that foreign countries or international bodies would recognise such arelationship as differing in essence from the normal treaty relationship betweenforeign countries. But, if this is so, associate membership is deprived of any material benefits which could not otherwise be accorded by one independent state to another, and the attractions of the conception are thereby likely to be greatlydiminished in the eyes of those members of the Commonwealth whose special needs it was designed to meet.7. Consultation. In theory, the creation of two types of membership ofthe Commonwealth should provide the solution for the difficult problems of inter-
Commonwealth consultation illustrated by OA. (48) 11. Certain countries, byopting for associate membership, would by their own choice accept a system ofmore formal a,nd less frank consultation, and it might at first sight appear thatthe United Kingdom Government would thereby be relieved of the invidious dutyof itself discriminating between one Commonwealth Government and another inmatters of consultation or communication of specially confidential information.In fact, however, this would only be so if the division between the British andthe &quot; associated &quot; members of the Commonwealth corresponded with the division between those Governments with whom we wished to keep in the closest consulta-tion and those with whom such consultation would involve risks of one kind or another. But it is impossible to be sure of this : on the contrary, there is a serious risk that the opposite might happen, and that we might wish to maintain closer relations on matters such as defence with countries such as South Africa and canada, who might be in the outer ring, than with some countries, such as Ceylon,which might decide to retain the &apos;&apos; British &apos;&apos; connection. The creation of a formof associate membership of the Commonwealth thus offers no solution to theproblem of Commonwealth consultation; and-the United Kingdom Governmentwould still find it necessary to exercise a discretion in deciding the basis of con-sultation with other Commonwealth countries. Such arrangements might wellcut across the constitutional lines of cleavage; and it would then be impossibleto devise any machinery for consultation which could be regarded as a distinctivefeature of associate membership of the Commonwealth. Indeed, it might benecessary, on this aspect of the common relationship, to recognise the existenceof two types of member within each of the two rings of the new Commonwealth.8. Exfulsion.--T\\&amp; British Commonwealth has been held together with little in the way of a written constitution because of the constitutional link of allegiance to a common Crown. If that link were to be abandoned, the purposes and terms of the new association would have to be defined in some form of Charter.Could such a Charter be complete without provisions defining the circumstances inwhich, and the procedure by which, an associated State might be expelled fromthe Commonwealth ? In an ord inary form of treaty relationship the Treatynormally defines the circumstances in which it may be denounced by a signatoryPower which finds it no longer useful or acceptable; and a PoAver which fails to fulfil its obligations under a Treaty can by application of an ordinary legalprinciple be refused its benefits. There is, therefore, normally no need for anexpulsion clause in Treaties. But in international associations like the League ofNations or the U nited Nations an expulsion clause has been accepted as a necessaryfeature of the Charter of the association; and we believe that such a provision would be required in any instrument defining the rights and obligations of themembers of a &quot;Commonwealth of British and Associated Nations.&quot; Thus, inview of recent developments in Burma, we cannot discount the possibility thatan &quot; associated &quot; State might pass under Communist control. If that shouldhappen, the rest of the Commonwealth could hardly ignore it. But it is far fromeasy to see how such a situation could be handled. Under the existing Common-wealth relation there need be no predetermined machinery for meeting suchcontingencies as these. Its flexible character has, for instance, enabled. theCommonwealth to adjust itself to the exceptional treatment of Eire in recentyears and would make a readjustment equally easy if Eire were willing in due course to resume a more normal status within the Commonwealth. Our existing system can adjust itself to temporary movements of opinion within the Common-wealth without the need for irrevocable constitutional decisions. These adjust-ments could not so readily be made with &quot; associated &quot; States whose relationswith other parts of the Commonwealth were precisely defined in a formalinstrument of association. Experience in the United Nations, and earlier in theLeague of Nations, has shown that any attempt to exclude a member from suchan association is likely to be a difficult and embarrassing proceeding. It wouldbe hard enough to reach agreement on the inclusion in an instrument of associationof provisions designed to provide for such circumstances : it would be still moredifficult to secure agreement to act under those provisions when the need arose.9. This examination of the practical problems involved suggests that itwould be difficult to cause the evolution of the Commonwealth relation to move in the direction of a &quot; Commonwealth of British and Association Nations.&quot; Wehave been forced to the conclusion that any form of association which could be devised along these lines would offer in practice no mutual benefits which couldnot as easily and extensively be provided by mutual agreement between foreign states, and it is possible that it would be more advantageous to us to be able todeal with certain States as foreign, countries than as &quot;associate&quot; members of
the Commonwealth. In short, we believe that in such a Commonwealth the &quot; asso-ciated &apos;&apos; States would be no more than foreign States in special treaty relationship,not with individual States, but with the Commonwealth as a whole.II. A &apos;&apos; Union of British Commonwealth and Other Nations 1&apos;10. Faced with this conclusion, we have considered whether it might notbe preferable to seek to hold all the members of the Commonwealth in a rather different form of association, which for present purposes may be described asa &quot; Union of British Commonwealth Nations and Other Nations.&quot; We could thenabandon any attempt to treat as members of the Commonwealth those peopleswho are no longer willing to accept the existing Commonwealth relation : it wouldbe clear from the outset that their status was that of foreign countries in a special relationship with the British Commonwealth. This arrangement would avoidsbme of the difficulties discussed in the earlier paragraphs : there would, inparticular, be no need to seek a &quot; common status &quot; or an acceptable form of constitutional link between all members of the Union. We cannot, however, see in such a Union the basis for an acceptable and enduring association. Itscontinued existence would depend on the recognition by its members of a commonpurpose and aim and of the advantages of continued association : it would notretain the emotional or sentimental ties which the Association discussed earlier in this report might be expected to inherit from the existing Commonwealth. Itwould, in fact, rest wholly on considerations of self-interest and could not beregarded by its members as a stage in the evolutionary development of the BritishCommonwealth. It cannot therefore be assumed that all the existing membersof the Commonwealth would be prepared to enter such a Union : Australia, forexample, might well be disinclined to enter voluntarily, on a basis of commonmaterial interests, into a form of association which might involve her in extensivecommitments on behalf of India. And, even if the Commonwealth countries could be persuaded to adopt a sympathetic attitude towards this proposal, it ishard to see how it would be possible to define in generally acceptable terms the commitments which the members of the Commonwealth would have to be preparedto undertake, individually and jointly, on behalf of the &quot; Other Nations.&quot; Forthese reasons, we doubt if it would be possible to give practical effect to this concept-tion. Even if it were practicable, the idea of such a Union might not be well received by foreign Governments. The Soviet Government would doubtless regard it as an alliance of hostile States; and more friendly countries might find ithard to reconcile with the United Nations.11. In these circumstances we doubt whether a satisfactory solution willbe found in either of the directions discussed in this Report. We therefore venture to suggest that Ministers should again consider the advantages of proceeding by way of &quot;re-defining&quot; the existing Commonwealth relationship on the lines suggested in our Third Report. When these proposals were previously consideredby the Committee, Ministers expressed concern at the probable reactions of publicopinion in this country; and the criticisms directed against the British NationalityBill have illustrated the political difficulties of modifying the existing forms of commonwealth relationship. But, if some changes must be made, those&apos; suggestedin our Third Report are, in our view, likely to arouse far less political controversythan those discussed in the preceding paragraphs of this Report. Any proposalsfor the creation of an entirely new type of Commonwealth would be bound to arouse vigorous and bitter opposition in all sections of political opinion in thiscountry and in the older countries of the Commonwealth overseas.12. We do not think it necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government to take any initiative in this matter in advance of the Conference of Commonwealth PrimeMinisters in October next. We understand that the Indian Constituent assembly is not likely to complete its.work before the autumn; and that, in the meantime,there is no danger that Indian Ministers will commit themselves on the main&apos;issue. But it will not be possible to postpone discussion beyond the Conference.In one form or another, certain aspects of &quot; re-definition &quot; are bound to be brought up, on the initiative of the older Commonwealth countries. And, on the main issue, there would be great advantage if Ministers could take the opportunity ofthe October meeting to hold frank discussions with the Prime Ministers of Indiaand Pakistan as well as with the Prime Ministers of the older Conihionwealthcountries.Signed on behalf of the Committee,NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,21s* July. 1948
ANNEX  III[C.R. (48) S][14th September, 1948]CABINETCommittee on Commonwealth RelationsCOMMONWEALTH  RELATIONSHIP :   CONSULTATIONS  with canada, AUSTRALIA AND NEW , ZEALANDReport by the Secretary of the CabinetON 27th July (C.R. (48) 3rd Meeting) the Committee asked the PrimeMinister to convey to the Prime Ministers of Canada, Australia and New Zealandtheir provisional views on the future development of the constitutional relation-ship between the self-governing countries of the Commonwealth. The PrimeMinister thought it preferable that this should be done orally, rather than byany written communications, and he asked me to carry a personal message on his behalf to the Prime Ministers of Canada, Australia and New Zealand and toascertain their preliminary views on these questions.During August I visited Ottawa, Canberra and Wellington. In OttawaI had conversations with Mr. Mackenzie King and Mr. St. Laurent, and also withsenior officials of the Department of External Affairs and Privy Council Office.In Canberra I saw Mr. Chifley and, in Dr. Evatt&apos;s absence&apos;in Europe, thepermanent secretary of the Department of External Affairs. In Wellington I sawMr. Eraser and Mr. Nash and senior officials of the Prime Ministers department and Department of External Affairs.2. In each of these capitals I found that Ministers and their official adviserswere very ready to re-examine the nature of the Commonwealth relationship.They were uneasy about the possible consequences for the Commonwealth of havingadmitted to full membership three Asiatic countries whose peoples do not sharethat common heritage and sentiment which are the strongest of the bonds unitingthe older members of the Commonwealth. They did not regret the admission ofthese new members or hope that they might now withdraw so that the older members might be free to continue their old-established methods of consultation and collaboration. On the contrary, they recognised that the power and influence of the Commonwealth would suffer if other Asiatic Dominions followed Burmaalong the road of secession. They therefore agreed that no effort should be spared to retain India, Pakistan and Ceylon within the Commonwealth; and that,if in the event constitutional difficulties proved to be the only obstacle, someconstitutional anomalies would be a small price to pay for the continuingcollaboration of these countries as members of the Commonwealth group. At thesame time, they insisted that the constitutional concessions which might have tobe made to these Asiatic countries (and possibly to South Africa) should in no circumstances-be allowed to impair or disturb the existing relations between the&quot; central&quot; members of the Commonwealth (the United Kingdom, Canada,Australia and New Zealand). This point was most strongly stressed by the[36031] D *
Prime Minister of New Zealand, who insisted that acceptance of any constitutional change, for example in India, must be accompanied by an unequivocal public declaration that this involved no change in the constitutional relations betweenthe United Kingdom and New Zealand. The Prime Ministers of Canada and australia, though they did not make the same demand for a public statement,were equally clear that public opinion in their countries would not tolerate anychange in the constitutional relations between the four &apos;&apos; central&apos;&apos; members ofthe Commonwealth.I therefore found a general disposition to reject any idea of framing new&quot; articles of association &quot; for the Commonwealth as a whole. All were relievedto find that United Kingdom Ministers were not contemplating either (i) ageneral dilution of the Commonwealth relationship to a point at which it couldbe accepted by all or (ii) a new form of Commonwealth association on the linesof the two-tier structure examined in the Fourth Report of the Official Committee(C.R. (48) 4). Neither of these solutions would have been acceptable in Canada,Australia or New Zealand.Thus, there was general agreement with the approach proposed in C.R. (48) 2and provisionally approved by United Kingdom Ministers, viz., that all the self-governing members of the Commonwealth should continue to form a single group,even though their constitutional relations inter se may not all follow precisely thesame pattern, and that it is unnecessary to change the constitutional relations ofall the members of the group merely because one or two of them insist upon a form of relationship.which is less close than that preferred by the majority. And&apos;it was agreed that, on this basis, the practical question will be how far can aparticular country deviate from the &quot; normal &quot; type of constitutional relationshipand still be regarded as a member of the Commonwealth?3. I discussed this question primarily in relation to India. It was generallyconsidered that India could not continue to be regarded as a member of theCommonwealth unless she were willing to accept for some purposes the jurisdiction of the Crown; but ail agreed that it would suffice if she accepted the King&apos;sjurisdiction in respect of her external relations.It was also agreed that if India adopted a &quot; republican &quot; form of constitution providing for a President as Head of the Indian State, this need not preventher continuing a member of the Commonwealth so long as it was accepted tha..the President would be the King&apos;s representative at least in respect of India&apos;external relations. It would be preferable that the President should be appointedby the King on the recommendation of Indian Ministers; but, even if theconstitution provided for the election of the President, this arrangement mightbe accepted so long as the President had the normal status of the King&apos;representative.4. I also discussed the possibility of further constitutional changes in Eire.I referred to the statements made in the Dail on 21st and 28th July and 5th August by Mr. McBride and Mr. Costello to the effect that Eire, though still&apos;&apos; associated &apos;&apos; with the nations of the British Commonwealth, had already ceased to be a member of the Commonwealth. These statements had been made under some political pressure and in themselves had no constitutional validity; butthey were of importance if, as was considered likely by Lord Rugby, the UnitedKingdom Representative in Dublin, they reflected an intention on the part of thepresent Government of Eire to repeal the Eire Executive Authority (external relations) Act, 1936. I found that the Canadian Representative in Dublin sharedLord Rugby&apos;s view that Mr. Costello&apos;s Government were likely to propose thisconstitutional change and had already reported in that sense to Ottawa.Mr. Mackenzie King, however, was very sceptical of this report: he doubted whether the Government of Eire would in fact propose the formal repeal of thissection. Such a move would, he thought, disrupt Mr. Costello&apos;s Coalition Govern-ment and would set back for years any prospect of fulfilling Eire&apos;s hopes ofending Partition in Ireland. Mr. Chifley and Mr. Fraser both took the same view.All were agreed, however, that if Eire should repeal her External relations act she would thereby sever her last Constitutional link with the commonwealth and could ho longer be regarded as a member of the Commonwealth. If therewas any reason to believe that Eire Ministers were under any misapprehensionon this point, it might be expedient that the United Kingdom Government shouldmake it clear to the Eire Government and explain its practical consequences.5. Mr. Costello has since publicly stated, at a Press Conference in Canada,that his Government do intend, to repeal this Act. His statement was not reportedin the press until 8th. September, by which time I had already completed my
Prime Minister of New Zealand, who insisted that acceptance of any constitutional change, for example in India, must be accompanied by an unequivocal public declaration that this involved no change in the constitutional relations betweenthe United Kingdom and New Zealand. The Prime Ministers of Canada and australia, though they did not make the same demand for a public statement,were equally clear that public opinion in their countries would not tolerate anychange in the constitutional relations between the four &quot;central&quot; members ofthe Commonwealth. -       -I therefore found a general disposition to reject any idea of framing new&quot; articles of association &quot; for the Commonwealth as a whole.

It would be preferable that the President should be appointedby the King on the recommendation of Indian Ministers; but, even if theconstitution provided for the election of the President, this arrangement mightbe accepted so long as the President had the normal status of the King&apos;representative.4. I also discussed the possibility of further constitutional changes in Eire.I referred to the statements made in the Dail on 21st and 28th July and 5th August by Mr. McBride and Mr. Costello- to the effect that Eire, though still&quot; associated &quot;with the nations of the British Commonwealth, had already ceased to be a member of the Commonwealth. These statements had been made under some political pressure and in themselves had no constitutional validity; butthey were of importance if, as was considered likely by Lord Rugby, the UnitedKingdom Representative in Dublin, they reflected an intention on the part of thepresent Government of Eire to repeal the Eire Executive Authority (external relations) Act, 1936.

If therewas any reason to believe that Eire Ministers were under any misapprehensionon this point, it might be expedient that the United Kingdom Government shouldmake it clear to the Eire Government and explain its practical consequences.5. Mr. Costello has since publicly stated, at a Press Conference in Canada,that his Government do intend-to repeal this Act. His statement was not reportedin the press until 8th September, by which time I had already completed my
interviews and was on my.^ay^home;::,I liaVeJ;howey&amp;,;&apos;hb; reason to believe thathis.:statement will alter, the definite view expressed to hie by the Prime ministers of Canada, Australia and New&apos; Zealand that if Eire should repeal this Act she can ho longer be regarded as a member of the Commonwealth.     &apos; *&apos; 16 It was suggested to me in Canada that if Eire should repeal the external relations Act she might still claim that she continued to be &quot;associated withthe &quot;nations&apos; of the : British. Commonwealth; and&apos; there are indications that sheintends to make this claim. Similarly, if India 01* Pakistan ceased to be membersof the Commonwealth, they also might.&apos;wish to be regarded as &quot; in association&quot;with:the Commonwealth nations.1 Mr. Mackenzie King suggested that there wasno reason why we should reject such a claim to a special &quot; association.&quot; Countrieswhich could accept no constitutional link with the Commonwealth must be treated,constitutionally, as foreign States; and it was agreed that it would be inexpedient to attempt to devise any. new formal union of &apos;&apos; British Commonwealth nations and Associated Nations.&quot; But we might accept, without seeking to define its implications, the claim that certain countries which had formerly been membersof the Commonwealth were still in a special &quot; association&quot; with it. As time went on, some practical features of this association might emerge which mightbe susceptible of definition; but it would be a mistake to try to frame in advanceany formal articles of association with which such States would be expected tocomply.This suggestion won acceptance in Australia and New Zealand.7. I raised in Canada the question of a possible change in the King&apos;s title.Canada&apos;s object in suggesting a change would be to avoid the term &apos;&apos;british dominions&quot;; and the title they would prefer is &quot; George. VI&quot;, of all countries of the British Commonwealth King by the Grace of God, Defender of the Faith.&quot;They recognised, however, that this would give rise to difficulties with Eire, if she regarded herself as a member of the Commonwealth, and would also be inappropriate in relation to any Asiatic country which was unable to recognise the Crown^s jurisdiction in its internal affairs. In these circumstances they agreed that it would be inexpedient for them to raise this question at the present stage. The better course would be to seek first for a solution of current orimpending constitutional difficulties over India, Pakistan and possibly Eire, andto consider subsequently what form of title would accord with the new consti-tutional facts as they emerge. This need not exclude the possibility of discussinga change in the King&apos;s title if it should appear that such a change would assisttowards a solution of the constitutional problems themselves. But Canada willnot take the initiative in raising this question for her own purposes at the forth-coming meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers. This view of the matter is understood and accepted by Australia and New Zealand.8. Similarly, all are agreed that at this stage no question should be raisedof formally amending the preamble to the Statute of Westminster. It is thegeneral view that the purpose of such legislation by the Parliament at West-minster should be, not so much to promote constitutional changes within theCommonwealth, but rather to record and regularise them after they have takenplace. . &quot;9. In Canada, Australia and New Zealand Ministers and their advisersshowed a close interest in the constitutional problems which have been emphasised,if not created, by the admission of India, Pakistan and Ceylon to full member-ship of the Commonwealth. But it soon became evident to me that they were all even more interested in the practical effects which this enlargement of theCommonwealth group may have on the established methods of consultation between the older members of the group. On this question there is great uneasi-ness and I found that discussions starting from the constitutional issue were constantly brought round to the problem of consultation. There is a persistentfear that the enlargement of the group may have the effect of limiting that fulland frank exchange of views to which the older members have become accustomed.There is also a good deal of apprehension about the consequences of dividing theCommonwealth countries into two groups for purposes of consultation and com-munication of information. There, is a strong feeling that,. while the four&quot; central&quot; countries of the Commonwealth may be regarded as a single group for most purposes, the others do not form a second homogeneous group but, for pur-poses of consultation at any rate, should be regarded rather as a number.pfseparate countries each with its own individual problems and interests.

APPENDIXCommonwealth RelationshipDraft Statement of General Principles for Discussion at October Meeting of commonwealth Prime ministers. Commonwealth policy should be directed towards maintaining the exist-ing membership of the Commonwealth, even though some Commonwealth countries(i.e., Eire, India, Pakistan and possibly South Africa) may be unable to acceptthe precise form of constitutional relationship which is preferred by the othermembers.2. Asiatic and African peoples, in particular, on attaining their indepen-dence may find difficulty in accepting the full implications of the common allegiance to the Crown. But the policy of educating dependent peoples to the point ofattaining &quot;independence within the Commonwealth &quot; will be frustrated unlessthe way is smoothed for these peoples to remain within the Commonwealth whenthey have become fit for independence.3. There should therefore be room within the Commonwealth for some independent peoples who cannot formally accept the full constitutional tiesimplied by the preamble to the Statute of Westminster.4. At the same time it is important that nothing should be done to impairor disturb the constitutional relations of those Commonwealth countries whichaccept and value the existing relationship which is symbolised and expressed bythe common allegiance to the Crown. &apos; There can, therefore, be no question ofdiluting the nature jand quality of the Commonwealth relationship to a point atwhich it could be accepted by all.As so much interest was shpwn in this question 1 ventured.to outline theproposals on methods and machinery for Commonwealth consultation which hadbeen approved by the Prime Minister and some of his colleagues&apos; shortly before Ileft London- explaining that these were tentative ideas which the Prime minister was thinking of putting forward at the meeting in October. The central idea wasthat we should move towards a more flexible system of consultation and that,instead of &quot; consulting Dominion Governments &quot; qr &quot; ascertaining the Dominionpoint of view,&quot; we should lean towards a more &apos;&apos; individual&apos;&apos; treatment ofparticular Commonwealth countries. Similarly, we hoped to be able to sup pi e-ment the Prime Ministers&apos; meetings, which were representative qf the Common-wealth as a whole, by smaller meetings of Foreign Ministers.; Defence ministers and Finance Ministers which would include only those Commonwealth countrieswhich were directly concerned with the particular questions under discussion. I also explained the machinery which we were establishing for consultation with commonwealth countries on the problems of long-term economic planning, andthe means by which Commonwealth representatives in London would be encouraged to develop direct contacts with the Foreign Secretary and his advisers on ques-tions of foreign policy. AH these developments, if approved and put into practice,would emphasise the advantages of dealing with Commonwealth countriesindividually and would avoid the dangers which would arise from dividingCommonwealth countries into two distinct groups for purposes of consultation.These general ideas were warmly welcomed by all the commonwealth ministers with whom I talked. They all regard the two subjects as closely inter-connected and I think it would be advisable that at the meeting in October thediscussions on the constitutional issues should also cover the practical problemsof Commonwealth consultation.10. On the constitutional issue I attach a draft statement of general principles which might serve as a basis for discussion in October with the representatives ofCanada, Australia and New Zealand. It would be convenient if copies of this statement could be communicated to the Prime Ministers of those countries inadvance of the meeting.- (SIGNED) NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,14th September, 1948.
Nor is it desirable that the independent peoples of the Commonwealth shouldbe formally divided into two classes, according to the extent to which they acceptthe full constitutional implications of the preamble to the Statute of Westminster.The conception of a &quot; Commonwealth of British and Associated Nations &quot; mustbe rejected. :5. The objective of Commonwealth policy must therefore be to retain theindependent members within a single group even though their constitutionalrelations inter se may not all follow precisely the same pattern. It is not necessaryto change the constitutional relations of all the independent members of theCommonwealth merely because one Or two of them insist upon a form of relation-ship which is rather less close than that preferred by the majority. There caiibe scope for sOme variety in the relations between the different parts of theCommonwealth.6. On this basis the practical question will be how far can a Common-wealth country deviate from the &apos;&apos; normal&apos;&apos; form of constitutional relationshipand still be regarded as a member of the Commonwealth ? There must be evidenceof a continuing desire to share in the practical aspects of Commonwealth collabora-tion; and also an acceptance of the link of common citizenship within the schemeof the British Nationality Act recently passed by the Parliament at Westminster.But, if those conditions are satisfied,. what is to be the minimum constitutionallink? Since the Crown is the symbol of the Commonwealth association, theremust be some recognition of the Crown. If, however, some commonwealth countries are unable to accept the jurisdiction of the Crown for internal purposes,it would suffice that they should accept the King&apos;s jurisdiction in their external relations.7. This recognition of the Crown for external purposes only must beregarded as the minimum constitutional link; and it must be accepted that a country which cannot profess even this limited allegiance to the Crown cannot betreated as a member of the Commonwealth.Thus, if the Government of Eire fulfil their declared intention to repeal the eire Executive Authority (External Relations) Act, 1936, they must be regardedas having severed the last constitutional link connecting Eire with the Common-wealth, and Eire must be treated as having ceased to be a member of the Common-wealth.8. It is not essential that the King&apos;s representative should in every Common-wealth country bear the title &quot; Governor-General.&quot; Each of the independentGovernments of the Commonwealth should be free to confer on the King&apos;s repre-sentative whatever title they prefer.9. If a Commonwealth country should adopt a &apos;&apos; republican &apos;&apos; form of constitution, providing for a President as the Head of the State, this need not beregarded as inconsistent with continuing membership of the Commonwealthso long as it is accepted that the President will act as the King&apos;s representative,at least for purposes of external relations. In such an event, it would be preferable that the President should be nominated by the local Government for appointment by the King. But even if the constitution provided for the election of a President, this system could be accepted if it involved no serious departure from the normal status of the King&apos;s representative.10. If India or Pakistan or any other Commonwealth country should electto remain within the Commonwealth on the limited basis of &quot; external relation-ship, &quot; the United Kingdom Government would publicly declare that this development involved no change in the constitutional relations between the othermembers of the Commonwealth. Similar assurances might be given at the sametime by other Commonwealth Governments.11. A country which is unwilling to accept the jurisdiction of the Crowneven in respect of her external affairs cannot be regarded as a: member of theCommonwealth. If Eire repeals her External Relations Act, or if India isunwilling to recognise the King&apos;s jurisdiction for any purposes, they will cease to be members of the Commonwealth and for all constitutional purposes willbecome foreign States. If in that event either of these countries&apos; wishes to statethat she continues to be &quot; associated &quot; with the nations of the British Common-wealth, there is no reason why this special association should not be acknowledged.This need not, however, imply any new kind of formal union of &quot;British andAssociated Nations.&quot; Countries which cannot accept any form of constitutionallink must be regarded as foreign States; and it would be inexpedient to attempt
ISto define what is meant by their &quot; association &quot; with the British Commonwealth.Some definable aspects of that new &quot;association &quot; may emerge as time goes on:but it will be preferable to wait and recognise subsequently links which have developed in practice rather than seek to devise in advance a formula of&quot; association &quot; with which such States would be required to comply.12, The existing relationship between Commonwealth countries would bemore accurately reflected if certain terms and phrases which are now out of datewere allowed to pass out of official use.   Thus : (a) The terms  &quot;Dominion&quot;  and  &quot; Dominion Government&quot;  should be avoided; such expressions as &quot; Commonwealth country &quot; or &quot; memberof the Commonwealth &apos;&apos; should be used instead in all official publica-tions and correspondence. This would carry to its logical conclusion the change which was made when a &quot; Commonwealth relations office &quot; took the place of the &quot; Dominions Office.&quot;(b) The use of the term &quot; Dominion status &quot; should similarly be abandoned,in favour of such expressions as &quot; become a fully independent memberof the Commonwealth &quot; or &quot; attain independence within theCommonwealth.&apos;&apos;(c) No opportunity should be lost of using language which stresses the factthat all the fully self-governing countries of the Commonwealth areof equal status. Thus, the term &quot; Commonwealth Prime Ministers &quot;should in future be used to describe the Prime Ministers of all commonwealth countries, including the United Kingdom.(d) Though no formal change is recommended, it may be useful to establish a practice by which the Commonwealth would commonly be described as &quot; the Commonwealth of Nations,&quot; instead of &quot; the BritishCommonwealth of Nations.&quot;
