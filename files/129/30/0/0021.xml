-    117$THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET COPY NO. 3 fCP. (kS) 2513rd November,  1 91+8*CABINETTRUSTEESHIP SCHEME FOR THE COAL,   IRON AND STEEL industries of THE COMBINED ANGLO-AMERICAN ZONE OP GERMANY&quot;Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will be interested to learn that theBritish and American Military Governors in Germany havereached agreement on a scheme for transferring trusteeshipres pon s responibilities for the coal,  iron and steel industries from military Government to German hands.      The proposals seem to&apos;me to be sound, and I should expect them to have a beneficial effect on German morale  and production.      The necessary law islikely to be promulgated within the next ten days.2. I regard the agreement as all the more satisfactorybecause General Robertson has obtained General Clay&apos;s agreement to the inclusion of a statement in the preamble tothe law laying down in express terms that the question of the eventual Ownership of the industries concerned is one fordetermination by a future freely elected German Government,(it has been agreed that the expression &quot;German Government&quot;shall be deemed to include a Western German Government).This statement,  as my colleagues are of course aware,  represents the policy to which His. Majesty&apos;s Government have long been committed.      It is nearly two years since I first tried toreach agreement with the American Government on a joint andpublic enunciation of this policy;    and I think that general robertson deserves great credit for the skill and patience withwhich he has finally achieved this object.3. The scheme as a whole was,  in accordance with theobligations which we undertook at the London Conference,communicated in draft form to the French and Benelux, governments for their observations.      All these governments welcomed the trusteeship proposals as such, but the French Government have-taken strong exception to the proposed inclusion of thestatement about ultimate ownership.      They argued that this was inconsistent with French views about the internationalisationof the Ruhr, that it was unnecessary in the present context,and that it represented a decision of policy which could notlegitimately be taken without full consultation with them andtheir prior agreement.      Representations to this effect weremade both in London and in Washington, and there was some ground for fearing that the United States Government (who hadnot been kept advised by General Clay of what was intended)might use the French protest as a pretext for urging the omission or watering down of the statement about ultimateownership.      I am glad to soy,  however,  that they have accep   idwithout argument our view that the statement should stand anthat the French Government should be so informed.
k- I might add that the preamble to the proposedlaw includes a satisfactory statement declaring&quot;that theindustries concerned will not be permitted to pass againunder the ownership or control of persons who furtheredthe aggressive designs of the National Socialist Party.Et kitForeign Office,  S.W.1.3rd November, 19h8.
