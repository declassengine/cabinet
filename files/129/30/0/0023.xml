THIS  DOCUMENT IS   THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTTHE REPEAL OF THE EIRE EXTERNAL RELATIONS act memorandum by the United Kingdom RepresentativeDublin, 1st November, 1948The Eire Government have recently announced their intention to repeal the external Relations Act of 1936, underwhich appointments of Eire diplomatic and consular officers have hitherto been made inthe name of the Crown. The main clause of the Aet reads as follows :-&quot; So long as Saorstat Eireann [IrishFree State] is associated with the follow-ing nations, that is to say, Australia,Canada, Great Britain, New zealand and South Africa, and so long as TheKing recognised by those nations as thesymbol of their co-operation continues toact on behalf of each of those nations (onthe advice of the several Governmentsthereof) for the purposes of theappointment of diplomatic and consular representatives and the conclusion ofinternational agreements, The King sorecognised may, and is hereby authorisedto, act on behalf of Saorstat Eireann forthe like purposes as and when advised by the Executive Council so to do.&quot;Historical2. It is worth while recalling briefly thecircumstances in which this Act was passed on 12th December, 1936. In Eire (the IrishFree State as it then was), as in all theother self-governing countries of theCommonwealth, urgent parliamentaryaction was required to bring the abdicationof King Edward VIII into effect. Mr. de valera&apos;s Fianna Fail Government did not,however, confine their legislation to whatwas needed for this purpose. Mr. de valera had already (in 1933) removed the^ ath of Allegianee and the right of appealto the Privy Council from the Constitutionof 1922, and had published the draft of anew Constitution which was entirelyrepublican in form. He took the oppor-tunity of the abdication to force throughtwo Acts, one of which removed the Crown15079   120-12and the Governor-General from the 1922Constitution; the other (the External Re-lations Act) maintained the use of theCrown solely for the appointment of diplo-matic and consular officers, and recognised the new King &quot; for these purposes^&quot; the dail was specially summoned and the Billsrushed through in one and a half days withthe aid of the compact Fianna Fail maj orityand a ruthless use of the guillotine. In thefollowing year (1937) Mr. de Valera&apos;s newRepublican Constitution passed into law.3. The External Relations Act thus be-came the only operative link with theCommonwealth; though worded in mostrestrictive terms it could be regarded askeeping alive the symbol of the Crown inthe field of Eire&apos;s foreign relations; andat the end of 1937 the United KingdomGovernment announced that they wereprepared to treat the new legislation &quot; as not effecting a fundamental alteration inthe position of Eire as a member of theBritish Commonwealth of Nations.&quot; Itwas added that the Governments ofCanada, Australia, New Zealand and theUnion of South Africa took the same view.4. In February 1948 Fianna Fails six-teen years&apos; tenure of office was brought toan end. The party lost many seats in thegeneral election of that month, and, thoughstill the largest single party, had no longera majority over all the others,, who forth-with banded together in the common causeof ousting them. The new Government,under Mr. -Costello, thus surprisingly con-desists of representatives of the Clann naPoblachta Party (which has a republicanplatform and at any rate some personallinks with the -old Irish Republican Army),the two Labour Parties, the Farmers&apos; party and, on the Right, the Fine Gael Party(Mr.. Costello&apos;s party and the direct suc-successors of Mr. Cosgrave&apos;s party whichfought for the treaty and consistently
2opposed Fianna Fail&apos;s axing of the links with the Commonwealth in the 1930&apos;s).5. Prior to the elections it was becomingclear that the External Relations Act wasa constant temptation to all parties;properly handled it might furnish the opponents of any Government with a cheapbut useful form &quot;of attack, and Mr. de valera, as the architect of a measure whichpreserved some remnant of the Crown inthe midst of his recently-won Republic,seemed increasingly sensitive on the subject.He did not, however, himself make it an issue in the election campaign, though Mr.MacBride&apos;s Clann na Poblachta maderepeal a plank in their platform, and Mr.Norton, the leader of one of the LabourParties, and at least one of the Fine Gaelleaders, made slighting references to theAct in electioneering speeches. With theformation of the new Government the Actseemed, to have taken on a new lease of life.The country as a whole breathed a sigh of relief at the ending of the monopoly of thedoctrinaire politicians of Fianna Fail andtheir eclipse by a Government which would,it was hoped, get on with the job ofgoverning and cease worrying about con-stitutional forms. The new PrimeMinister, Mr. Costello, within a few days of his appointment, made the specific state-ment that &quot; there will be no constitutional change of any sort,&quot; and linked this witha wish for very friendly relations with theUnited Kingdom. Mr. MacBride, the newMinister for External Affairs, had already stated that, while the repeal of the Actremained an ultimate aim of the Clann naPoblachta, they had received no mandate for it from the electorate and it must remain in abeyance for the time being.During their first months all members ofthe Government frequently reiterated their desire for the closest and most cordial relations with the United Kingdom, andthis happier atmosphere bore fruit in theTrade Agreement negotiated between united Kingdom and Eire Ministers inJune and signed by the two PrimeMinisters at the end of July.6. It is difficult to account for the sud-den change in the situation. The rot set in when Mr. MacBride, under cross-examination in the Dail on 21st July, madethe, apparently unpremeditated but down-right, statement that Eire was &quot; certainly not a member of the British Common-wealth.&quot; This gave rise to direct Parlia-mentary Questions, in reply to which Mr.Costello said that Eire had ceased to be&apos;: formally &quot; a member, but was &quot; associated -ated&quot; with the other members of theCommonwealth.    On  6th August,  in  a debate in the Dail Mr. de Valera said thatif the Government were to bring in a Billto repeal the External Relations Act theywould find no opposition, and Mr. Nortc-%(Deputy Prime Minister) replied that irtfthought it would be a good thing to abolishit without delay. Nobody, however, tookMr. Norton&apos;s statement as committing theGovernment; and there was genuine sur-prise when reports were received from canada on 7th September (where he was making an unofficial visit) that Mr. Costellohad stated at a press conference that theGovernment had definitely decided to repeal the Act.Eire Politics7. There can be no doubt that the Govern-ment have bungled matters; Mr. Costello,especially, has played his part in a pecu-liarly amateurish fashion. suggestions have been made that Mr. MacBride hasbeen behind it all, and that repeal is the&quot;pound of flesh&quot; which he has insisted on exacting as his price for refraining from breaking up the Government. Thishas been vigorously denied by Mr. Costello,and from confidential information we know that the initiative was not in fact takenby Mr. MacBride. We understand that,before Mr. Costello left for Canada, theCabinet had had some discussion on thesubject and had taken a decision in prin-ciple that the Act would have to go; butthey had given no consideration to thequestion of timing nor, as a Cabinet, had they gone into the possible consequences.Mr. Costello&apos;s announcement in Canadaseems to have been as much a surprise tohis colleagues as to everyone else. ,8. The position of Mr. Costello&apos;s FineGael Party is especially anomalous. It wasthey who consistently opposed the whole ofFianna FaiFs policy in the 1930&apos;s of cuttingthe constitutional links with the UnitedKingdom. It was they who in 1936referred to the Crown as the symbol of irish freedom and of Irish membership ofthe Commonwealth. It was they who werelooked upon in the February elections asthe defenders of the Commonwealth link.Yet it is the Government of which theyform the largest party which is cutting thefinal link. It is indeed astonishing thatthe party which fought a bitter civil war to defend the 1922 Constitution and t,Jtreaty against the Republicans, should themselves initiate the abolition of the lastremnant of that for which they fought. Itis clear that party members are bewilderedand anxious; and, off the platform, mem-bers of the Government speak in an apolo-getic tone.   Publicly the line taken by the
Government is that this last tenuous link with the Crown was a constant irritant toopinion in Eire; that it was dishonest anddeceitful since Eire pretended to be are public at home while acting as amonarchy in the diplomatic field; and thatrepeal is not inspired by any hostility tothe Commonwealth, but that on the con-trary the removal of this cause of frictionis a constructive act designed to make a stronger and more enduring friendshippossible.9. The motives behind these moves areto be found in the game of Eire internalpolitics. Fine Gael seem to have thoughtthat they could, as a newspaper has put it,&quot; outbid Mr. de Valera on his own cards.&quot;Their claim that the repeal of the Act isrequired by some burning public resent-ment, or indeed for any other reason, is completely untrue. Astonished at theirown daring iconoclasm, they must now finddaring phrases to justify it. Time will show whether, in attempting to dish Mr. de valera, they have not dished themselves.If Fianna Fail had introduced repeal (andthis may have been the main reason why they held back), Fine Gael would certainly have been able to rally very strong elements in the country to defend the existing links.Undoubtedly some of the enthusiasm forthe new Government arose from the expectation-tation that they would be able to establishrelations with the Commonwealth on anhonestly friendly basis, free from the historical memories and doctrines whichhave bound Mr. de Valera so tightly. FineGael have turned their backs on this. Andthey cannot shut their eyes to the fact that,by their own action, they have done gravedamage to the very cause by which they set the highest store, the ending of the par-titioning-off of the Six Counties in theNorth. They may speak brave words aboutputting their relationship with theCommonwealth on a new and firmer foot-ing; but any sort of new formula orarrangement would lay them open toviolent and ruthless attack by Fianna Failwhich they would not, it seems, be preparedto face.Effect on Relations with the Common-wealth10. The consequences of the repeal of theAct are now being examined by the UnitedKingdom and Eire Governments. AfterMr. MacBride&apos;s statement in the Dail inJuly and Mr. CostehVs announcement inCanada, it was clear that Eire could not participate in the meeting of Common-wealth Prime Ministers held in London inOctober, and.no invitation was sent to the eire Prime Minister. But the decision to repeal the Act was a matter of direct interest to many members of the Common-wealth, and, at Mr. Attlee&apos;s invitation, two members of Mr. CosteJlo&apos;s Cabinet,Mr. MacBride and Mr. McGilligan (FineGael), met Commonwealth representatives at Chequers on 17th October. The UnitedKingdom was represented by the PrimeMinister, the Lord Chancellor, and theSecretary of State for commonwealth relations; Canada by Mr. St. Laurent(Prime Minister Designate); Australia byDr. Evatt (Deputy Prime Minister); andNew Zealand by Mr. Fraser (PrimeMinister). The discussions were entirelyinformal and friendly. On all sides desirewas emphasised to maintain close relations of friendship between Eire and the various members of the Commonwealth. It was clear, however, that it may well prove diffi-cult to maintain the preferences which exist between Eire and. the members of theCommonwealth in the field of trade and&apos;citizenship.11. At present Eire enjoys the full bene-fits of &quot; Imperial preference&apos;&apos; for herimports into the United Kingdom. UnitedKingdom trade similarly enjoys prefer-ential treatment over a considerable range of imports into Eire. Under the new british Nationality Act Eire citizens arenot aliens but are given equal treatmentwith British subjects and can becomeUnited Kingdom nationals in the same way as citizens of other commonwealth countries, merely by twelve months&apos; resi-dence. They can freely enter the Govern-ment services, including the armed Forces,and can train for, enter and practise the professions, such as medicine, the law, &amp;o,on the same basis as British subjects. Theproblem is that, if by repealing the ActEire loses international acceptance of herCommonwealth status and becomes aforeign country indistinguishable in lawfrom any other foreign country as regardsher relationship with the United Kingdomand the other members of the Common-wealth, then international treaties guaran-teeing most-favoured-nation rights toforeign countries may come into play toprevent the continued grant of suchpreferences as these^between Eire and theCommonwealth. The legal questions nowunder examination are thus, whether,following repeal of the Act, preferences canbe maintained against most-favoured-nation claims from foreign Governments,or whether, if they are maintained, theywill open the door for an extension of
preferences between foreign countries\e.g.., trade preferences between latin american countries) which would be detri-mental to Commonwealth, and especiallyUnited Kingdom interests.It will be recalled that the Statute of westminster referred to the Common-wealth relationship in the following terms : &quot;The Crown is the symbol of thefree -association of the Members of theBritish Commonwealth of Nations, andthey are united by &amp; common allegiance tothe-Crown.&quot;12. It has been authoritatively statedthat &quot;the United Kingdom Governmentsattain de is that of readiness to consider any and every possibility of getting round theproblems which the repeal of the Act would create.&quot; The attitude of other Common-wealth Governments is understood to be generally the same.&apos; The difficulty is that,if any mitigation of the possible conse-quences were to be effected, it would haveto be on the basis of arrangements whichwould be not only acceptable to the UnitedKingdom and to the Commonwealth, but which would also be held to be valid in international law. The attitude of the eire Government may be summarised -asfollows : (a) They earnestly desire to continueclose relations with the Common-&apos;   wealth.(-&amp;) Their line is that these relations willbe strengthened if based on factorsof tradition, custom and common interest rather than on &apos;&apos; out-worn &apos;&apos; *constitutional forms. - -(c) They desire to maintain the existing preferential rights and privilegesWhich, since the creation of newrights is not involved, would not, intheir Opinion, entitle other nations to raise objections under most-favoured-nation clauses.id) If, nevertheless, preferential rightshave to be sacrificed, they are&quot;prepared to face the conse-quences &apos;&apos;; they are determined togo through with the repeal of theAct, and alternative formulse for membership of the Commonwealthare not likely to evoke any response from them, since any such&apos;&apos; entanglements &apos;&apos; would lay themopen to damaging attack from theOpposition.13. The Bill repealing the external relations Act will be introduced in theOireachtas (Parliament) as soon as it meetson 17th November, and, as it will not be opposed, will pass through all its stagesvery quickly.
