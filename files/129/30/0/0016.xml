(48) 24622nd October, 1948Copy No.31CABINETInternational Labour Conference, Geneva, June-July, 1947LABOUR INSPECTION IN INDUSTRY AND COMMERCEMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service the concurrence of my colleagues is sought in the action which it isproposed that the Government should take in regard to a Convention and two recommendations adopted at the 30th Session of the International LabourConference. A report on this Conference (Geneva, 1947) was annexed to cp. (48) 133.2. Discussions have taken place between the various Departments primarily concerned on the action which should be taken in relation to the Convention(No. 81) and the Recommendations (Nos. 81 and 82) which concern LabourInspection. The texts of the Convention and Recommendations were presented to Parliament in Cmd. 7437. Authority is now sought for the issue of a white paper in the form of the attached draft, setting out the Government^ decision in regard to them.3. The draft White Paper is, I hope, self explanatory and I need not further summarise the proposals here except to say that it is proposed to ratify the Convention while taking advantage of certain exemptions for which it provides; and that it is proposed to accept Recommendation No, 82, but not toaccept Recommendation No. 81, although of course those provisions of the latterRecommendation which are in fact acceptable will be applied.4. I shall be putting forward proposals later concerning the five otherConventions adopted at the 30th Session of the Conference.G. A. I.Ministry of Labour and National Service,22nd October, 1948.36023
Draft White. Paper- INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCEThere are set out below the decisions of.His Majesty&apos;s Government on aConvention and two Recommendations adopted by the International LabourConference at its 30th Session in 1947 which it is proposed to communicate tothe Director-General of the International Labour Office. The English and Frenchtexts of the Convention and Recommendations were presented to parliament in Cmd. 7437.Convention (No: 81) concerning Labour Inspection- in Industry and CommerceThis Convention deals with the organisation of labour inspection in industryand commerce. States which ratify it are required to maintain a system of labourinspection&apos; in industrial and commercial Workplaces. The Convention containsprovisions relating to the functions, scope and powers of the labour inspectorateand as to the conditions of recruitment and employment of labour inspectors.Mining and transport undertakings or parts of such undertakings (Article 2 (2))and cotornercial workplaces (Article 25) may at the discretion of a ratifying Statebe excluded from the- application of the Convention,His: Majesty&apos;s Government- propose to ratify this Convention and thenecessary steps to&apos; this end will be taken as soon as possible. In ratifying thisConvention :-(i) His Majesty&apos;s Government will apply its provisions in so far as they relate to industry, including, mining undertakings, and including, those parts of transport undertakings which are factories and the loadingand unloading, of ships.(2) For the time being His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to take advantageof the provisions permitting&apos; certain workplaces to be excluded fromthe application of the Convention and do not propose to apply theprovisions of the Convention to transport undertakings beyond theextent mentibfled above, nor to commercial workplaces. The applica-\-t tion of the provisions of the Convention in these eases would involvethe introduction of fresh legislation. There is at present sitting aCommittee of Enquiry set Up by His Majesty&apos;s Government which isto enquire into and make recommendations as to extending, strengthen-ing or modifying the statutory provisions relating to the health,welfftfe and safety of employed persons at places of employment otherthan those regulated under the Factories or Mines and Quarries Actsand as to the machinery for enforcing such statutory provisions. HisMajesty&apos;s Government must therefore reserve their position in regardto the application of the Convention to commercial undertakings andto transport undertakings in general pending the receipt of the Reportof the Committee of Enquiry. (But see below the action proposed inrelation to Recommendation No. 82.)Recommendation (No. 81) Concerning Labour InspectionThis Recommendation is supplementary to Convention No. 81. Under therecommendation labour inspectors would be&quot; given preventive duties and powersgoing substantially beyond those provided for in the Convention, including a power to prohibit the carrying out of plans for new establishments, plant orprocesses of production except in accordance with alterations ordered by the inspector. In addition, the Recommendation deals with arrangements for collaboration between officials of the* labour inspectorates and employers and workers in regard to health and safety, recommends that the functions of labourinspectors should not include that of acting as conciliator or arbitrator in proceed-ings concerning labour disputes, and indicates detailed statistical and other
information which should, so far as possible, be included in annual reports on labour inspection.His Majesty&apos;s Government agree with much of this Recommendation. Thus,they are in agreement with those provisions which relate to the collaboration ofemployers and workers in masters of health and safety and also with those pro-visions which relate to the limitation on the functions of labour inspectors inconnection with labour disputes. Moreover, His Majesty&apos;s Government agreethat regard should be had to the proposals contained in the Recommendationrelating to the detailed information which should be embodied in annual reports on the workof the inspection services. &apos; -       &apos; &apos;&apos; :On the other hand, the proposals regarding the preventive duties of labourinspectors are Open to various&apos; obj elections and cannot: be accepted. .Furthermore;-the collection of some of the statistical information proposed by the Recommenda-tion to be included in the annual reports, while it might be possible, would, inthe view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, involve more labour than appears to bejustified.While, therefore, His Majesty&apos;s Government will take steps to apply those sections of the Recommendation which they regard as practicable and desirablethey cannot accept the recommendation as a whole.Recommendation (No. 82) Concerning Labour Inspection in mining and Transport UndertakingsIt is pointed out above that. Convention No. 81, which deals with theorganisation of labour inspection in industry and commerce, under Article 2 (2)permits the exemption of mining and transport undertakings from the applicationof the provisions of the Convention. This Recommendation supplements Con-vention No. 81. It draws attention to the need, notwithstanding the permittedexemptions referred to, to make adequate provision, in respect of mining andtransport undertakings, for the effective enforcement of legal provisions relatingto conditions of work and the protection of workers while engaged in their work,and provides that each Member of the International Labour Organisationaccepting the Recommendation should, as rapidly as national conditions allow,apply to mining and transport undertakings appropriate systems of labour irispec-tion to ensure such enforcement.His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to accept this Recommendation.
