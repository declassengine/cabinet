DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTTOP secret annex APandit Nehrtj&apos;s &quot; Ten Points &quot;Constitutional ProvisionsI. The declaration as to the status of India will be left as at present inthe draft Constitution.2. In the appropriate place in the Indian Constitution, probably in theprovision on Repeals, it will be enacted that the Indian Independence Act 1947is repealed in as far as it is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution.3. Either in the Constitution, or in a separate Nationality Act passedcontemporaneously, there will be incorporated the substance of the relevant provisions of the United Kingdom Nationality Act which will have the effectof making Indian nationals Commonwealth citizens, and the nationals of anyCommonwealth country Commonwealth citizens when they are in India. Thisarrangement will thus be on a reciprocal basis.4.   As soon as the constitutional changes are settled, or at such other time as may be agreed upon the Prime Minister of India and the Prime Minister of. the United Kingdom will make declarations announcing the changes and their nature and results.Arrangements Outside the Constitution5. The King as the first Citizen of the Commonwealth will be the fountainof honour so far as the Commonwealth as a whole is concerned. It does notappear that any legislative or constitutional enactment is called for in respectof this matter. Understandings and administrative arrangements may be reachedor made.6. In any new legislation, or new treaties entered into with other countries,the Commonwealth countries will not be treated as Foreign States and theircitizens will not be treated as Foreigners.In particular, in any new commercial treaties it will be made clear thatfor the purposes of the &apos;&apos; most-favoured-nation &apos;&apos; clause the commonwealth countries are in a special position and are not regarded as Foreign States.7. In Foreign States where the Indian Government has no representation,it will be at liberty to make use of any other Commonwealth country&apos;s Ambassadoror Minister; and the Indian Government will be willing to provide reciprocalfacilities for any other Commonwealth Government that so desires.8. For the purpose of fulfilling the obligations of the Crown towardsCommonwealth citizens other than Indian nationals the President of the IndianRepublic may at the request of the Crown act on behalf of the King within the territories of India. A similar arrangement on a reciprocal basis will apply to indian nationals in the rest of the Commonwealth.9. So far as the United Kingdom is concerned it appears to be the position that the King waived his rights of appointment, &amp;c, and, generally speaking,all the functions of sovereignty in favour of the people of India in virtue ofthe Act of 1947. Since there will be no further legislation on India so far asthe United Kingdom is concerned, this will continue to be the position and theIndian people and their representatives (such as the President of the Republic)will exercise all functions of sovereignty.General10. These proposals represent a sincere desire to continue the Common-wealth association and what is practicable and adequate at present. No doubt as the relationship is not a static arrangement, further development by way of association may take place.II. The Prime Minister of India will discuss the problem and the above proposals with his colleagues directly, on his return to India with a view tocommunicating with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom proposals as36118 R
2from the Government of India. It will be for the United Kingdom Governmentto make such approaches as appear appropriate to the other parties concerned for such consents or acquiescences as may be deemed necessary.ANNEX BINDIAOpinion of the Lord Chancellor and Law Officers on the Statement(dated 28th October, 1948) drawn up by the Prime Minister of IndiaWe have been asked to consider the possible legal effect of&apos; the pointsagreed upon by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Mr. Nehru. We have considered this document with great care and we append, in Appendix 1 to this opinion, some comments on the detailed points made. . We think, however, thatit will be most useful if we state our conclusions in the matter at once and asshortly as we can.. 2. The effect of ss.6 (1), (2) and (3) and 8(1) of the Indian IndependenceAct, 1947, is that the Constituent Assembly of India has, for the purpose ofmaking provision as to the constitution of the Dominion of India, full power tomake laws for India, whether or not those laws are repugnant to the IndianIndependence Act itself; and that the Governor-General has power to assent inHis Majesty&apos;s name to laws so made. The Constituent Assembly will shortly beinvited to pass a constitution which recites that the people of India have solemnlyresolved to constitute India into &apos;&apos; a sovereign democratic republic &apos;&apos; and proceedsto make full provision for its government (its head being a President) withoutThe King being once mentioned. We have no doubt that the effect of this, ifthe constitution is passed, is to extinguish His Majesty&apos;s sovereignty in India.It will no longer be a part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions, either under Indian lawor under the United Kingdom law.It was suggested to us in the course of some most helpful discussions whichwe have had with Mr. Krishna Menon and Sir B. N. Rau that the sovereignty of His Majesty would not be absolutely extinguished but would only be dormantor suspended and might be revived by an appropriate amendment of the indian constitution. We have considered this suggestion, which is as subtle as it isnovel, with the greatest care, but in the end we find ourselves with regret quiteunable to agree with it.3. One consequence of India ceasing to be as a matter of United Kingdomlaw part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions is that, if India is to be continued to betreated under that law as not being a foreign country, legislation will, sooner or later and probably sooner rather than later, be necessary to secure that this resultfollows as a matter of our municipal law. The outcome of the enquiries we have caused to be made on this point is to be found in Appendix 2 to this Opinion,but shortly the point is that the statute book deals with foreign countries on theone hand and parts of His Majesty&apos;s dominions on the other and does not recognise(except in the limited field of protectorates, trust territories, &amp;c.) any category of country between the two. If we do not admit that India is &quot; foreign &quot; the resulting gap will have to be filled.4. Assuming the decision were taken to continue to treat India for all purposes as within the Commonwealth and not as a foreign country, and thatany necessary amendments to secure this were made in our municipal law, weproceed to examine what the position would be under the most-favoured-nationsclauses of our various commercial treaties. The drafting and phraseology of thesetreaties vary. Essentially, however, the question arising in the case of each one ofthem would be whether India was or was not a &apos;&apos; foreign &apos;&apos; country in relation tothe United Kingdom or some other Commonwealth country. In the great majorityof the treaties the natural construction of the treaty, if taken by itself, is that inthe context of the treaty the words &apos;&apos; foreign country &apos;&apos; mean a country which isiiot within His Majesty&apos;s Dominions. Thus we would be in a difficulty at the outset. There are, however, some treaties concluded shortly before the outbreakof the War in 1939 which define the words &apos;&apos; foreign territory &apos;&apos; as meaning a territory which is not a country of the British Commonwealth.   It could be argued
that the earlier treaties used the term &quot; His Majesty&apos;s dominions &quot; because, whenthose treaties were entered into, the Crown was the sovereign of each country of the Commonwealth, but that the reality always was the membership of theCommonwealth, which has remained the same although it is no longer appropriate to describe it by a reference to the old symbol of common allegiance to HisMajesty. This argument might perhaps be successful before an international court if we were able to point to a continuous and substantial tie between membersOf the Commonwealth, subsisting after, as well as before, the repudiation of allegiance to His Majesty.5. Would there be such a tie ? In our vieAv the only matters of any substancethat could be pointed to with any plausibility as creating such a tie would be : (i) the de facto general acceptance by all civilised nations, of the existenceof the Commonwealth as a unit composed of nations bound togetherby a factual association of long standing, based up till now on thecommon sovereignty of the Crown, and still continuing;(ii) declarations to be forthcoming by the Prime Ministers and perhaps the Legislatures of the surviving members of that Commonwealth,that they wished to be and regarded themselves as &quot; still bound ina special form of association &apos;&apos;; and(iii) the common Commonwealth citizenship.We assume, for the sake of the argument, that these declarations and the provisionfor such common citizenship would be forthcoming from each of the survivingmembers of the Commonwealth. If they were forthcoming from some only of them,the position would, of course, be much more difficult to maintain. Beyond what we have stated above, there might be other minor links to point to, but we cannotbelieve that they would in the ultimate result affect the question.6. We do not believe that such general acknowledgment of the existenceof the Commonwealth, even together with the declarations referred to in 5 (ii)above, would without the citizenship be sufficient. Coupled, however, with a real common citizenship, the result might be different. For this to be so, however,it would have to be the case that the common Commonwealth citizenship gayerise, in practice, over the whole, or substantially the whole, of the commonwealth to a special position in regard to those who enjoyed it. We are forced to theconclusion that this condition is not satisfied.7. In the United Kingdom, it is true that a Commonwealth citizen has atpresent a special position as compared to an alien in several important respects.He enters the United Kingdom as of right, whereas an alien may be refused theright of entering; when there, he is not subject to deportation, he is eligible for membership of -Parliament, for office under the Crown, civil and military, andfor membership of certain professions from which aliens are excluded, and hemay acquire a Parliamentary or municipal vote by fulfilling the ordinary qualifica-tions as to residence and the like; he may own a British ship or British aircraft;he is, under certain of our extradition treaties (but not all) free from liability to. extradition; he can claim in certain circumstances to be registered as of rightas a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies; if, outside the United Kingdom,he suffers violence, e.g., on the high seas, at the hands of servants of the Crown,he cannot, if he sues for damages in the United Kingdom Courts, be defeatedby the bare plea of 1&apos; Act of State &apos;&apos;; and he has certain other rights of lesspractical importance. He has too, at present, one serious liability to which an alien is not subject; he may, in certain circumstances, be liable under the existing british law to be called up for service in the British armed forces after two yearsresidence here.8. This, as regards the United Kingdom, makes a formidable list. It is thecase that these rights and liabilities are not necessarily permanent. The UnitedKingdom is under no obligation to other members of the Commonwealth not to vary the rights and liabilities of Commonwealth citizens set out above, andtherefore Parliament in this sphere is completely free. On the whole we do notthink that this would affect the position if it could truthfully be said that theposition which obtains in the United Kingdom obtained in substance all over theCommonwealth. Unfortunately, however, this is not true. We set out the position,so far as we have been able to ascertain it, in Appendix 3 to this Opinion. Inbrief, the most important of the rights mentioned in the last paragraph, viz., theright to enter and remain in a country and to influence, by vote and membership of its governmental or public institutions, the way it is governed, are not36118 b 2
generally, or even normally, conceded in Commonwealth countries outside theUnited Kingdom to Commonwealth citizens as such. The most that can be saidis that in most places in the Commonwealth, most Commonwealth citizens arein some respects (but not the same respects in the case of the various parts of theCommonwealth) treated slightly differently from aliens. As we pointed out above,this differential treatment is precarious.9. In these circumstances, the most we can say is that, if. preferential treatment were continued to India after the passing of her now constitution,more or less.plausible arguments could be put forward in opposition to a claimby some foreign country that that foreign country was entitled to the same treat-ment under the most-favoured-nation clause. We cannot say that these argumentseither could or ought.to succeed; indeed, we are inclined to the view that theywould not succeed. We think it right to add that if they did succeed, they wouldor might open the way to a claim by, e.g., a South American or Arab country,that, notwithstanding our most-favoured-nation rights under a treaty with thatcountry, that country was entitled to extend preferential treatment to other south american or Arab countries, We are told that this is a position which south american countries have in the past tried to secure. To support it they wouldbe able to point to a common history interrupted it is true-of domination bya common sovereign, whether the King of Spain or the King of Portugal. Theywould be able to point to a much greater degree of cultural, linguistic andreligious unity than is the case with the Commonwealth, at any rate so long asthe new eastern dominions form part of it. They would be able to point to aninternational organisation in some respects more closely integrated than there is between the members of the British Commonwealth. And they might easily beable to arrange a common citizenship with at least as much substance behind it as the Commonwealth citizenship will probably, have in the Commonwealthif the Commonwealth persists with the new eastern dominions in it. Up to now we have met this kind of claim by pointing to the thing they have not got, viz., acommon allegiance to the same Crown. This we would no longer be able to do.10. As lawyers, we think we ought to emphasise two features of the situa-tion. First, if India is to be treated as still in the Commonwealth, a decisionto that effect will for a variety of reasons have to be made without delay, willhave to be agreed with the other members of the Commonwealth, and will haveto be published forthwith; there can be no evading the problem. Secondly, ifthe decision were that India was to be treated as still within the Commonwealth,we, as lawyers, would be asked in Parliament, and pressed to answer, the questionwhether, in our view, this was in accordance with our obligations under the most-favoured-nation clauses, and the position would be very difficult to maintain ifwe were not able to reply by a categorical yes. As we have said above, the most that we could honestly say, as at present advised (and in a matter of this natureParliament is entitled to our candid opinion), is that it could be plausibly con-tended that the treaties allowed the course to be taken which we were taking. Itis obvious that this answer would not satisfy Parliament or public opinion.11. We add in Appendix 4 to this Opinion some observations on the relation of the questions discussed above to some of those arising in connection with Eire.We relegate these observations to an Appendix, not because they are unimportantbut because they are not directly germane to our main argument as set out above.3rd November, 1948
APPENDIX 1Detailed Comments on the Nehru memorandum. We give below our comments in detail on the first nine paragraphs of theMemorandum of 28th October, 1948.Paragraphs 1 and 22. We state in paragraph 2 of our Opinion our view of the effect of thedeclaration in the constitution as to the status of India when read with sections six and eight of the Indian Independence Act, 1947. It is not without significancethat the enacting words of the constitution, which, under point 1 of the memo-randum, are to be left as at present, read &apos;&apos; we, the people of India . . . . give to ourselves this constitution,&quot; words which clearly imply that in their view their action is wholly independent of any authority which might be derived from theIndian Independence Act, 1947. We would add here that the fact that theIndian Independence Act, 1947, &quot; will only be repealed so far as inconsistent Aviththe provisions of the constitution &quot; does not, in our view, alter the conclusion inparagraph 2 of our Opinion. The negative provisions of the Independence Actare not inconsistent with the Constitution, but its positive provisions are. Thereis thus no inference to be drawn from the limitation put on the repeal, and if therewere it would be so slight as to be valueless.Paragraph 33.   We comment on this in our Opinion.Paragraph 44. A declaration, satisfactory in its terms, and concurred in by all themembers of the Commonwealth a point not brought out in Pandit Nehru&apos;sMemorandum is almost a prerequisite of the case for immun^ from the most-favoured-nation clause being even arguable. We observe that the Memorandumcontemplates a statement by Prime Ministers. In the discussions which we had with Mr. Menon and Sir B. N. Rau, it was suggested that such a declaration might also be introduced, in effect by way of preamble, into the Indian law aboutnationality.  This, though not essential, might help.Paragraph 55. We agree that an agreed conception of the King as the fountain of honour for the Commonwealth as a whole would perhaps be of some assistancebefore an international court in maintaining the &quot;unity and persistence of theCommonwealth. It could, however, hardly be more than a makeweight. Moreover,we draw attention to the phrase &apos;&apos; The King as the first citizen of the Common-wealth.&quot; The King is not a citizen, he is The King, and this expression would,in consequence, be inappropriate technically. This consideration, though perhapssomewhat technical, of necessity would imply a change in the conception of theposition of the King, both as respects India and as respects the other countries of the Commonwealth which do not repudiate His allegiance. This objectionwould not obtain if some alternative expression such as Head of the Common-wealth &apos;&apos; was used.Paragraph 66. We agree that if India is to stay in the Commonwealth, the course ofaction proposed in this paragraph is inevitable, and we indeed go further andthink see Appendix 2 that legislation amending existing United kingdom legislation will probably have to be passed. But we doubt whether the adoptionof the practice suggested in paragraph 6 of the Memorandum would have anyeffect on the decision of an international court unless it had lasted for a consider-able number of years before the case came before it.Paragraph 77. We understand this as a recommendation that the existing practice in.^ls matter shall continue. If it does, and other nations generally acquiesce init, the point might be a useful makeweight in an argument before an international court, but it can hardly be more.36118 B 3
Paragraph 8 \- \-\ ,.\8. We had, when we first considered it, some difficulty in understanding whatwas contemplated by this, paragraph, but we have since had the advantage of seeing a letter (dated 1st November, 1948) from the Chancellor of the exchequer to&apos;the Secretary, of State, for Commonwealth Relations, which explains what he thinks was in Mr. Nehru&apos;s mind. This starts from the position that Indians will,when within the United Kingdom, be entitled to be treated in some ways differentlyfrom, and more favourably than, aliens, just because they, the Indians, areCommonwealth subj ects; and the proposal in the letter, if we understand itrightly, comes to this; that in according (through the usual agencies of the Crown)this preferential treatment, The King should be considered as acting at the requestof the President.Upon the assumption that we have correctly interpreted Mr. Nehru&apos;suggestion, we cannot think that it would have any value for the purpose in view.It will, in fact, be by virtue of the United. Kingdom law that the preferential treatment if any is accorded. If that law provides for it, The King will be bound to accord it, and if that law withholds it The King will be bound to with-hold it.  The request, therefore, can only be a fiction.Paragraph 99. It is not in our view the case that The King waived his functions of sovereignty by the Act of 1947. That Act, it is true, discharged His Majesty&quot;sGovernment in the United Kingdom from their responsibilities and rights inIndia on his behalf; but it made clear that there was to be a Governor-Generalappointed by him and representing him, with the function of assenting &quot; inHis Ma;jesty&apos;s name &quot; to laws of the legislature of the Dominion. Moreover,His Majesty has in fact been accrediting the Indian Ambassadors to foreign powers.If, however, what is meant by the paragraph is that The King, by assentingthrough his Governor-General, under Section 63 of the Indian IndependenceAct, 1947, to the new Constitution of India, will in doing so waive all thefunctions of sovereignty, we agree; but we would add that in our view a waiver of all the functions of sovereignty is indistinguishable&quot; from a waiver of sovereignty itself.APPENDIX 2Legislation which would be necessary if Preferential Treatment were extended to India after she ceases to be part of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions1. There are numerous references in the Statute Book to &quot; His Majesty&apos;sdominions&quot; (far more numerous references than those to &quot;foreign countries&quot;)and probably all these ought to be extended so as to include India. Most ofthem, however, are of little practical importance, and we have inquired how far it would be possible to ignore them in order to avoid legislation. Our enquiries are not complete, and our conclusions may not in detail be entirely accurate : butwe are reasonably clear that this could not be done.2. The subject which would raise the point most quickly is that of customsduties. The Empire preferences in effect depend as a matter of our municipallaw, on (amongst other things) whether India is within &quot;the British Empire&quot;as that term is defined in s. 21 (1) of the Import Duties Act, 1932. The definition,so far as relevant, is &quot; the expression 1 British Empire &apos; means His Majesty&apos;sdominions outside the United Kingdom (including all parts of India).&quot; Thebracketed words were plainly originally inserted in view of the position of theIndian States, but their presence perhaps would enable one to argue (though we doubt whether the argument is really correct) that India will still be in &apos;ctheBritish Empire &apos;&apos; for this purpose even though she ceases to be within HisMajesty&apos;s dominions. It should be noticed in this connection that the effect ofs. 18.(1) of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, is to make the reference to India a reference to : both, the new dominions of India and Pakistan. ; It is possible,therefore, though hardly more than possible, that for the time being at any ratewe could get along without an amendment of the Customs Acts.3. As regards citizenship, the British Nationality Act, 1948, is probablyadequate without amendment.
4. Practical difficulties will, however, arise sooner or later about fugitivecriminals. So long as India is within His Majesty&apos;s dominions, these can be dealtwith under the Fugitive Offenders Acts. These Acts, however, are expressed interms of His Majesty&apos;s dominions and, without amendment, will cease to applyto India. The Extradition Acts will not be available, because these are expressed,in terms of &quot; foreign countries&quot; and it is essential to deny that India will bea foreign country. A permanent lacuna on this topic cannot be contemplatedand sooner or later legislation will be necessary.5. Difficulties may also arise under Part II of the Medical Act, 1886, asamended by the Medical Practitioners and Pharmacists Act, 1947, s. 9. Thisprovides for the registration as &quot; Commonwealth practitioners &quot; of certain persons with diplomas from within His Majesty&apos;s dominions, and for registrationas &quot; foreign practitioners &quot; of certain persons with diplomas from foreigncountries. There is nothing between the two, and probably the position of theIndian who turns up with a degree from Madras or Bombay University willsooner or later have to be dealt with.6. Sooner or later, it will probably also be necessary to deal with companieswho claim to own British ships. They can do this if they are &apos;&apos; bodies corporateestablished under and subject to the laws of some part of Her Majesty&apos;s dominionsand having their principal place of business in those dominions,&quot; see the MerchantShipping Act, 1894, s. 1, paragraph (d). The case may turn up sooner or laterof a British company with their principal place of business in Bombay orCalcutta who wish to own a ship registered in London. Even if no such caseturns up in practice, the amendment of the paragraph so as to cover India wouldbe logically demanded by the conception that India is in no respect treated asa foreign country.7. As regards the form of a new) formula to replace &quot; His Majesty&apos;sdominions &apos;&apos; we have arrived at no definite conclusion. We consider the phrase&quot; countries bound together by common allegiance, common citizenship, or otherties &quot; followed by a list of the countries concerned, but this may be open to the objection that &quot; other ties &quot; would leave it open to us to admit into the Common-wealth the United States or Denmark, a position which is not plausible. It isonly when membership of the Commonwealth is confined to those who originallybore allegiance to the British Crown in the days when this represented a realsovereignty that the contention that its members are less &apos;&apos; foreign &apos;&apos; to one anotherthan the members of the Arab League or the various South American inter-governmental organisations becomes plausible. Possibly a preferable course wouldbe boldly to use the phrase &quot; Commonwealth of Nations.&quot; For the moment itis not necessary to pursue the point.APPENDIX 3Position as regards rights of Commonwealth citizens in respect of-(i) entry;(ii) franchise;in(a) the old Dominions and Southern Rhodesia;(b) India;(c) the Colonies.I I. The &quot; Old &quot; DominionsCanadaEntry. Immigration for permanent settlement is restricted to Britishsubjects from United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Eire and newfoundland.   Asiatics are excluded.Franchise. Canadian domicile is obtained after five years&apos; residence. this includes the franchise.  Indians are not debarred from the franchise.
AustraliaNon-European British subjects must obtain special permission from Immi-gration authorities for entry- whether for visiting or for immigration purposes. -The franchise, which is open to Indians, is granted after one year&apos;s residencein Australia and three months in polling district.Neiv ZealandEntry. No legislative ban on Indians as such, but special permits for entrywhether on a visit or as immigrants are required by non-European Britishsubjects from the Immigration authorities as in case of Australia.Franchise isj granted after 1 year&apos;s residence in New Zealand and 3 months in polling district.   No discrimination on grounds of race.South AfricaEntry. British subjects by birth of European descent do not require permits. to enter Union (Immigrants Regulation Act, 1913).Paragraph 4 (1) (a) :1&apos; Any person or persons deemed by Minister on economic grounds oron account of standard or habits of life to be unsuited to the requirementsof the Union or any particular province thereof . . . . &quot;is used to bar the entry of Cypriots, Maltese and Asiatics. ,Franchise. After 1 year for European British subjects. None forAsiatics (representation clauses of Asiatic Land Tenure and Indian Repre-sentation Act have been repealed).Southern RhodesiaThere is a property qualification for entry, and regulations are applied onthe same lines as in the case of South Africa.The franchise is given after six months&apos; residence, subject to a propertyqualification.II. India.Entry. There is no restriction on the right of entry of any British subjectwho has a passport duly endorsed as valid for entry into India. The only legalground for refusing entry, or if entry is effected, requiring an illegal entrant toleave, is the fact that the passport has not been endorsed for India.Franchise. The conditions for the franchise in India are laid down in the sixth Schedule of the Government of India Act, 1935. The necessary qualifica-tion has hitherto been that the voter must be a British subject (or a ruler or subjectof an. Indian State). The qualifications for voting in a European constituencyor an Anglo-Indian constituency are that the person must be descended in the maleline from a person &quot; of European descent.&quot; The new draft Constitution leavesthis question for separate legislation.Discrimination against South AfricaAll persons of non-Indian origin domiciled in South A frica have been declaredProhibited immigrants &apos;&apos; and as such are not allowed to enter, and reside in,British India, without obtaining exemptions or entry permits. On the same principles on which such permits are granted to Indians in South Africa, only temporary entry permits are granted for short periods, not exceeding one year at a time on payment of a fee of Rs.155 and of a security deposit not exceedingRs.2,500.   Ordinarily, a security deposit of Rs.600 is actually levied.Persons of non-Indian origin domiciled in the Natal and Transvaal province ^cannot, without a permit, acquire any property or occupy any land or premises in India which were not occupied by any South African of that class Vbefore1st December, 1944. vA person of non-Indian origin domiciled anywhere in the Union except the cape Province is debarred from the franchise of a local body in India, unless hehad been on the electoral roll of that body before the commencement of the rules.
III. The Colonial Empire1. ImmigrationP&quot; In general it may be stated that persons who do not &quot; belong to &quot; a territoryk-&quot; have no right to enter except on complying with prescribed conditions. In somecases the natives of neighbouring territories (sometimes including foreigncountries) are for this purpose treated as if they were natives of the legislatingcountry. This is the position, for example, in West Africa and the western pacific, and in Hong Kong all Chinese, whether British subjects or not, are inpractice admitted. In Fiji the paramount interest of the native Fijians is safe-guarded by specially restricting immigration of British subjects from Asia by administrative means.2. DeportationThe position is somewhat similar to that obtaining with regard toimmigration, except that in most, if not all, territories, exemption from deportation-tion is limited to persons belonging to the territory.3. FranchiseResidence for a prescribed period is of course required, as in the UnitedKingdom. Further, in certain countries, the different races are represented on thelegislature in different ways, e.g. in Kenya, Arab representatives are appointedwhile European and Indian representatives are elected on two different communalregisters.   The position is somewhat similar in Fiji.4. LandThere are probably discriminatory laws in several territories but perhapsone example will suffice. In Kenya, native trust lands are reserved for nativesand the European Highlands are reserved for Europeans.5. TaxationIn certain territories, particularly in Africa, races are differentially taxed,e.g. the native and non-native poll taxes.6. JuriesIn some dependencies Europeans only (and United States citizens) areentitled to trial by jury on a criminal charge.7. National service during the war in some places Europeans were conscripted, others werenot. Further, in a few territories natives do not in practice (though there isprobably no legal bar) attain the higher ranks in the local forces.APPENDIX 4Eire1. Assuming that Eire will cease to be in any sense within His Majesty&apos;sdominions and will also cease to be within the Commonwealth, the question will arise whether the special treatment accorded to citizens of Eire by the british nationality Act, 1948, can continue. It would seem very difficult to contend thatit can, and if it cannot, various provisions of that Act, notably s.3 (2), will haveto be-repealed. We understand, however, that it may be very difficult in prac-tice to treat citizens of Eire in exactly the same way as other aliens; their merenumbers may be too much for the administration machine to deal with. If thereis any question of a concession for citizens of Eire, whether it be provided for[f&quot;;by law or merely allowed in practice, over other aliens, this will make it propor-I;.- tionately more difficult to contend that the Commonwealth citizenship (on whichwe must largely rely in support of the view that India, is not a foreign country &quot;) has any real content.2.   If the conception of &quot; dormant Sovereignty &quot; were valid for India, it isdifficult to ;^ee how it would not be just as valid for Eire.   The background I   United Kingdom Acts which contemplate continued &apos;&apos; Dominion status,&apos;&apos; and new
Constitutions which, by their terms, deny it-is the same. The sole real difference is that the Eire Prime Minister does, and the Prime Minister of India does not,proclaim the extinction of Sovereignty. In view, however, of our rejection ofthis conception it is perhaps not necessary to pursue the point further.3. In support of the contention that the repudiation by India of herallegiance to His Majesty does not alter in essence the nature of the Common-wealth tie, it seems at first sight a most relevant point that since 1936, Eire&apos;s onlylink with the Commonwealth has been the tenuous External Relations Act, 1936,and that British subjects in Eire have been technically aliens under Eire lawalthough by order not treated as such, but that this has not prevented Eire being-granted Commonwealth treatment without challenge. It may, in fact, be thoughtby some people that, if foreign countries are prepared to accept such a purelyformal and tenuous legal link, they are likely to be. accommodating to changes which replace the purely formal legal link by the links indicated in paragraph 5of our Opinion. We give, however, little weight to this. Probably the absenceof challenge is to be explained rather by lack of understanding on the part offoreign countries of the exact effect of the Eire External Relations Act and ofher citizenship legislation than as a conscious acceptance by them of the proposi-tion that Eire is really entitled to Commonwealth treatment notwithstanding themost-favoured-nation clause. Moreover, the war supervened shortly afterMr. de Valera&apos;s legislation and thereafter there was little desire or opportunityfor foreign countries to raise the point.
