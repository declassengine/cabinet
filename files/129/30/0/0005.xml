THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP&apos; HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT)S E 0 R E TCP. (48)  23515th October, 1948.MOTORWAYS bill memorandum by the Minister of transport. At the meeting of the Future Legislation Committeeon 13th October (F.L.(48) 7th Meeting),  the question was raised whether the policy of building motorways in thiscountry was sound and I was invited to prepare a memorandumon the subject for consideration by the Cabinet.      The two main developments which were mentioned as necessitating areconsideration of this policy were the deterioration in railway revenue and. the restrictions on capital investment.2. I would remind my colleagues of the history of thismatter.      In the statement on highway policy which, with theapproval of the Cabinet, I made in the House of Commons on 6th May,  1946  (extracts annexed) I indicated the Government&apos;intention to include motor roads in the future road system;and it was this part of my statement (with its accompanyingmap which was exhibited in the Tea Room) that attracted thegreatest publicity.The question of motor roads was further consideredby the Lord President&apos;s Committee on 2nd August,  1946(L.P.(46) 29th Meeting, Minute 7) when they approved theproposals contained in my memorandum L.P. (4-6)  191*&quot;2,COPY NO. ^cabinet. The scope of my proposals and their justification are;-(a) The provision of new roads reserved for motortraffic is justifiable only when and to the extent that existing all-purpose roads cannot be improved oradapted to serve the reasonable needs,of such trafficconsistently with safety and economy.(b) Motorways will be constructed only where a case hasbeen made out for additional or improved roads;    ina number of these cases motorways will be cheaper andmore conducive to safety than all-purpose roads.(c)    Motorways will be of two main types(i) routes to carry traffic between importantcentres of population (including development areas)  e.g. Birmingham to South Wales.(ii) By-passes or other lengths of new road wherethe existing roads are inadequate and it wouldbe impracticable to improve them to thenecessary standard.
(d)    The advantages of motorways are:-(i) Safety:    by segregation of fast traffic,elimination of intersections and absence of^ &quot;    - - - frontage development.(ii) Speed:    because flow is uninterrupted.(iii) Economy:    a motorway occupies about 10 percent less land and is about 15 per centcheaper than a corresponding all-purpose roadbuilt to modern standards with fly-overjunctions and separate cycle tracks andfootways.(iv) Diversion of through traffic from existingall-purpose roads,  leaving them safer andfreer for local traffic including pedestriansand cyclists.4. These considerations are as relevant now as in 1 94&amp;&quot; ,and in addition the need for promoting a Motorways Bill hasbecome increasingly urgent because: -(a) The future highway programme is bound up with thepreparation of development plans under the Townand Country Planning Act,  1947, which is now well underway,  and also with the planning of new or expandedtowns and of development areas.      Many of theproposed roads in this programme are being planned for eventual construction as motorways.      Motorwayproposals cannot be included in these plans as if theywere ordinary all-purpose roads in the hope that powers will be available so to construct them when thetime comes.      The differences in respect of access,crossing,  junctions with side roads,  etc., mayradically affect the planning of adjacent areas andthe line suitable for an all-purpose road is not always suitable on engineering grounds for&quot; a motorway.(b) The passing of a Motorways Bill now would facilitateprogress with the plans for road works to be put inhand as may be necessary to implement the policy of full employment. Much survey and design work hasalready been done on that basis and will have to be scrapped if the power to construct motorways is notto be available.On these grounds the Future Legislation Committee agreed on20th February this year (F.L.(48)  2nd Meeting, Minute 2) that theBill should be included in the programme for introduction at thebeginning of the forthcoming Session.5*   - I now pass to the two considerations which it has beensuggested necessitate reconsideration of the policy hithertoaccepted:-(A)      Deterioration in railway revenue.      The economic aspects     of the construction of motorways go far wider than their possible effect on railway revenue.In so far as the reduction in railway revenues may bedue to rood competition, the position will not be corrected bystifling highway development..     The growth of rood transport willnot be arrested by this means.      So long as consignees find it
cheaper or more convenient to send their goods by road, theywill not be deterred by congestion on the roads and the national economy will continue to bear the losses due to delays andaccidents on inadequate roads.Also, the loss of prestige in foreign eyes due to a failure to plan our future road system on up-to-date lines wi11react against the ability of our civil engineering industryto sell its skill,  experience and wares abroad.Our long-term transport policy must be planned to fulfil the aim set in the Transport Act:    that is to soy, theprovision of a properly integrated system of public transport,in which all forms of transport will play their due part.The highway network is as necessary as the railway lines,  andhas its value for nationalised transport to the extent thatthe road transport interests of nationalised transport arepart of the same revenue-earning system as railways. &apos; &apos; In fact,the British Transport Commission will in time be the mainprovider of long-distance road goods transport in this countryand, when acquisition under the Transport Act has been completed,will own or control about h.2,000 goods motor vehicles of which32,000 will be predominantly engaged in long-distance haulage.Also,  if the area schemes so provide,  they will have apredominant interest in long-distance rood passenger services;in this field they have already assumed control of one of thelargest omnibus combines.      I see no grounds on &quot;which therailway revenues should be considered in isolation from.thoseearned by the Rood Transport Executive.(B)      Restrictions on capital investment.      The passage of aMotorways Bill would not be the signal for immediate expenditure .on any large scale.      It would provide the necessary powers to embody certain roads in the future road.plan on the basis thatthey would be built as motorways and not as all-purpose roadswhen the time comes. .   The policy of including motorways in our future road pattern should not involve any material increase inthe annual expenditure which would otherwise have to be met bythe&apos; Government in respect of roads, nor would it imply that theexpenditure should be incurred any earlier.6. It may help to indicate what is proposed if I give some illustrations where motorway construction will clearly be advantageous and where planning, which has already started,should continue without delay on that basis:-(a) The Government is committed to the construction of anew road bridge over the Severn to improvecommunications between South Wales and the midlands and London.      If that bridge is to fulfil its purpose communicating roads must be provided.      Itwill be better,  cheaper and safer to construct theseroads on the motorway principle.(b) To improve communications between the northern port of the South Wales Development Area and the Midlandsa new road is required between Ross and Tewkesburyto provide an outlet in connection with the road which is to be developed along the top of the valleys.Here again a motorway will be better, cheaper andsafer than an all-purpose road.
V e(c) The construction of the new town at Stevenagenecessitates a diversion of the existing London-Edinburgh Trunk Road and the same considerations apply in favour of building this diversion as amotorway;    the existing road will continue toprovide adequate facilities for local traffic,cyclists and pedestrians.(d) A by-pass is required at Newport, Monmouthshire.There would be the greatest difficulty in planning a satisfactory line except as a motorway.      Inthat form it can with safety be located nearer tothe centre of the town and on a more direct line than would be possible for an all-purpose road.(e) &apos; The County of London Plan provides for theconstruction in due course of ring roads.      If the inner or &quot;A&quot; ring road is to serve its purpose, itshould be constructed as a motorway at other thanground level and, in my view, the high cost of thisscheme would not be justified on any other basis.&apos;-Construction is in the future, but the line ofthe rood should be fixed as soon as possible so as not to hold up other development.      If motorwaypowers are not to be available the line of this roadwould be materially different.(f) Near Biggleswade,  the alignment of the Great NorthRoad is so poor and there are so many villages andso much spasmodic development that it is impracticable to improve it on its present line.      It will benecessary, therefore,  in due course to provide analternative.      The cheapest way of doing thissatisfactorily will be to construct a motorway on anew line,   leaving the old road available for localtraffic, cyclists and pedestrians.7. In the light of all these considerations I ask mycolleagues to reaffirm the policy of including lengths ofmotorway as part of our future road system and -to agree to theintroduction of a Motorways Bill at the beginning of the corningSession so that proper provision for these roods can be modein the development plans now in preparation.A.B.Ministry of Transport,  S.W.1.15th October,  I9J48.
ANNEXExtracts from statement on Highway Development^Government ProgrammeT&quot;made by the Minister ofTransport in the House of Commons on (rth May,1914.5711                 The pattern of this plan must be determined now asit will form the framework upon which the planning of townand country will largely be based........................The second stage should see the completion ofarrears of maintenance and continued activity in the elimination of accident &quot;black spots&quot;;    increased activity   -on major road works of new construction, among which high priority will continue to be given to road improvements -including a limited number of motor roads for the development areas and other works begun before the war, many of whichshould be finished during this stage.        ...................In the last five years my programme envisages a comprehensivereconstruction of the national routes.      Some of these pass through many towns and villages and are so restricted byfrontage development,  or by physical features that,  in theinterests of safety, efficiency and economy, it will be best to construct new roads reserved for motor traffic.If Parliament sees fit to grant the necessary powers, it would be my intention to start on a further numberof motor roads where that course is found to be preferable to the widening or by-passing of the existing roads.      Thelatter, freed from fast-moving through traffic, would thenremain available for pedestrian,  cyclist and local motortraffic, which would use them in greater comfort and security.I have arranged to exhibit in the Tea Room a diagram depictingthe principal routes which,  on my present information, wouldprobably be most economically constructed as motor roads andalso those capable of improvement generally on their presentalignment but with by-passes,  some of which would be ofconsiderable length and reserved for motor traffic.&quot;
