(48) 232).R. S. treasury Chambers,9th November, 1948.ECONOMIC report . Man-power the Ministry of Labour figures of employment in September are not yet available. Preliminary figures show that there was a further small increase inthe number of persons employed in cotton spinning in September. recruitment to the coal mines continues to be disappointing and the number of workers onthe colliery books fell from 725,900 on 21st August to 724,400 on 23rd October.2. There has been no fall in employment in the building and civil engineering industries. The number of operatives aged 16 and over employed in these industries in Great Britain was 1,024,000 in September 1948, compared with1,005,000 in September 1947. Over the twelve months the number employed onthe construction of new houses fell from 271,000 to 229,000 and the number onrepair and maintenance of houses (other than war damage repairs) rose from148,000 to 171,000. Conversions and adaptations occupy 47,000 the same number as in September 1947. Employment on war damage repairs fell from126,000 to 104,000 but the number on building and construction for industry,agriculture and other work rose from 412,000 to 473,000.11.-Production3. The index of total industrial production (1946 = 100) is provisionallyestimated at 109 for August 1948, compared with 112 for July and 124 in June.This fall in production during the holiday months was more marked than in 1947.Index of Total Industrial Production(1946 = 100)May ...June ...JulyAugustSeptember36088		Change1947	1948	1947 to 1948109	118	-f9114	124	+ 10107	112	-1-5104	109	4-5115	m . .

4. Production in May and June of this year was about 10 points above thelevel of production in the same months of 1947; but production in both july and August this year was only about 5 points greater than in the correspondingmonths of 1947. It is too early to say whether this represents a falling off in &quot;&quot;\the rate of expansion of industrial production or simply the effect of more wide-spread holidays this year.Coal5. The output of deep-mined coal has recovered from the effects of summerholidays and is now showing the usual seasonal rise during the autumn. Duringthe last two weeks of October production just exceeded 4 million tons. This stillwas 2 - 3 per cent, below the targets for the two weeks.6. Total output of deep-mined coal for the beginning, of the year hasamounted to 161-4 million tons or 3-4 million tons below the target for this period.7. Output per man-shift overall rose to 1-14 tons in the third week ofOctober the highest figure reached since November 1947. Absenteeism fellslightly to 11-9 per cent, but this was still greater than in the correspondingperiod of last year.8.   Production of opencast coal in October was the same as in September.Iron and Steel .9. In the first three weeks of October the output of steel ingots and castingswas maintained at 297,000 tons a week. Pig iron output recovered from 174,000tons a week in August to 181,000 tons a week in September. Stocks of steelscrap rose further to 465,000 tons in the week ended 16th October and areexpected to be maintained at about 460,000 tons during the last two monthsof the year. Stocks of pig-iron have also risen slightly to 462,000 tons and areforecast to increase to over 500,000 tons by the end of the year.Textiles10. Production of cotton yarn rose in September to 17-1 million lbs. a week,and increased further to 18-3 million lbs. in the second and third weeks ofOctober.   Output is still much below what it was expected to achieve in 1948.11. The output of worsted yarn rose in September to 15-9 million lbs. Thisis below the target of 17-3 million lbs. for September and below the previous peakoutput of 16-4 million lbs. in April. Production of woven wool fabrics rosesharply in September to 24-6 million lbs. the highest level so far achieved: though below the target of 26 - 2 million lbs. for the month.12. A new record output was achieved in September by the rayon industry.Production of rayon yarn and staple fibre rose to 20-9 million lbs. 4 per cent,above the previous record in October 1947.Motor vehicles13. The output of passenger cars recovered in September to 6,926 a week.Of these, 5,046 a week were produced for export. The proportion of large carsbeing produced continues to rise rapidly. The number of cars of over 2,200 c.c.produced for export increased from 124 a week in the first quarter of theyear to 246 a week in August and to 408 a week in September.Weekly output of large passenger cars (over 2,200 c.c.)For for home market      export Total1948 1st Quarter         ......      106 124 2302nd Quarter        ...      ...      112 168 280July                 ......      189 119 308August    .........      201 246 447September        ......      299 40814. 1,984 commercial vehicles a week were produced for the export market inSeptember a record level.
III.-Building15. During September 19,157 new permanent houses were completed inGreat Britain 15,853 by local authorities. The number of houses started inSeptember rose to 15,088 the highest figure in any month this year. The numberunder construction, which had fallen steadily from 252,988 at the beginning of theyear to 202,000 at the end of August, declined to 197,931 at the end of September.16. Between December 1944 and 31st August, 1948, 3,684 schemes have beenapproved in Great Britain for new factory buildings estimated to cost  182million. Licences to start building have been granted for. 2,991 schemes to cost 134 million but 800 schemes of the value of  51 million have been temporarilydeferred. Of the total value of  134 million licensed, just over one half is in theDevelopment Areas where the value of buildings under construction at the end ofAugust was  49 million including  23 million of work temporarily deferred.480 schemes valued at  17-7 million had been completed in the Development areas by 31st August.IV.-External Trade.&quot; 17. The value of British exports in September amounted to  131 million. Thevolume of these exports is estimated to be 132 per cent, of the 1938 level. Theincrease in the volume of exports, compared with the corresponding months oflast year, was smaller in the third quarter of this year than in the second quarter.Volume of British Ex-ports (1938 = 100)1st quarter 2nd QuarterJuly  ...AugustSeptemberOctoberNovemberDecember18. The value of imports fell again in September from  173-8 to  169-4 million. Re-exports were higher and the adverse visible balance of trade for themonth (imports c.i.f. less exports and re-exports f.o.b.) declined by  6 million to 33 -1 million. For the first three quarters of the year the adverse balanceamounted to  354 million ( 39 million a month) compared with an adverse balanceof  591 million (or  49 million a month) in the whole year 1947.19 All	1948	Change101	126	-1-25102	134	-^32126	149	+ 2S105	133	+ 2S111	132	+ 21121		112		120		Y. Balance of Payments19. The last quarter of the year has started off comparatively well. InOctober, the net gold and dollar deficit amounted to  22 million, compared with 29 million in September and a monthly average in the third quarter of  25million. This result is the more satisfactory in that expenditure on imports hasbeen seasonally larger and to a certain extent some of the shortfalls on the thirdquarters purchases are being made up. It is too early to say what are the factorsresponsible for keeping the total deficit down, but after a rather heavy month inSeptember, net expenditure by the Rest of Sterling Area appears to have been fairly light. Too much importance must not, however, be attached to one month&apos;s figures; evidence from the last two quarters suggests that dollar takings early inthe period tend to be rather low and to increase later on.20. South Africa paid us  7 million in gold in reimbursement for meetingher non-sterling area deficit during July.  This is a larger figure than of late.21. Cash reimbursements from the United States Economic Co-operation administration amounted to  17 million, compared with a monthly average ofrather less than  14 million in the third quarter. This rather better trend isexpected to continue, but as cash reimbursements were less than the current deficit in October, the actual reduction in our gold and dollar holdings has continuedthough at a decreasing rate.36088

The index of import prices (1938 ^100) fell by 1 per cent, during september from 292 to 289. The index for raw materials was 2^ per cent, lessthan in August owing mainly to lower prices for raw cotton and wool and theindex for manufactures fell from 279 to 274.23. The price index of United Kingdom exports (1938 = 100) rose from251 in July to 255 in August and further to 258 in September.Wholesale Prices24. The Board of Trade index of wholesale prices declined again inSeptember to 217 (1938 = 100). The index has now fallen steadily for threemonths from 219 in June. There is now some hope that wholesale prices may havereached their peak, at least for the time being.Retail Prices25. The Interim Index of Retail Prices was unchanged again in Septemberat 108 (June 1947 = 100). The index of food prices at 107 was lower than in any month since January. The index of clothing prices, however, rose further from112 to 113.Prices in the United States26. The index of wholesale prices in the United States has now remainedstationary for two months. The index of wholesale prices of farm products, whichrose between July and September 1947, declined this year from 286 in July to276 in September. Moody&apos;s index of staple commodity prices (31st Decem-ber, 1931 ^00), which was 434 at the end of July, fell to 400 on 3rd Novembercompared with 447 a year ago. On the other hand the index of Canadian whole-sale prices (1926 = 100) rose from 152 in July to 158 in August.VII. -Wage Rates27. The index of weekly wage rates (June 1947 = 100) for all industriescombined, which had risen to 106 in June, has remained unchanged in July,August and September.28. Increases in wage rates which became effective in September as a resultof agreements reached during the month or earlier added approximately  61.400to the weekly wage bill of 247,500 workers. The most important increases werein various branches of the clothing industry. They resulted in an addition of 46,800 a week for 176,000 workers and raised the index of wage rates for the clothing industry from 109 in August to 112 in September (June 1947 = 100).There was also a reduction of about  16,200 in the weekly wages of 204,000workers due entirely to reductions under sliding scale agreements linking wage rates to movements in the Interim Index of Retail Prices.
29. The most important wage agreement made during September was theacceptance by both sides of the Engineering Industry of the recommendation by the Court of Enquiry of an increase of 5/- per week in the national bonusand a raising of the lowest district base rates. This agreement came into forcein October. A. similar increase of 5/- per week has been agreed by the shipbuilding-industry. It is estimated that these two agreements will add approximately 400,000 to the weekly wages of If million workers and will raise the index of wage rates by 1 per cent.30. Of the new claims presented during September the most important isthat made by road transport workers for extra pay on Saturday afternoons. It isestimated that this demand would add at least  3 million a year to the wage bill.New claims have also been put forward in the brick industry, electrical contracting,roadstone quarrying and the bleaching, dyeing and finishing sections of the textile industry.31. The latest Earnings Enquiry of the Ministry of Labour shows that theaverage weekly earnings (including bonus, overtime, &amp;c.) of adult men rose from128s. Id. in October 1947 to 134s. in April 1948 a rise of 94 per cent, comparedwith October 1938. Average hourly earnings were 99 per cent, above 1938, Theaverage hourly earnings of women (October 1938 = 100) rose from 124 per cent,in October 1947 to 134 per cent, in April 1948 and those of girls from150 to 175 per cent, of 1938.32. In the coal mining industry, information collected by the National coal board shows that the average weekly cash earnings (excluding allowances in kind)of adult male workers rose from 152s. lOd. in October 1947 to 173s. 2d. in April1948. The increase was due mainly to the operation of the Extra Hours of WorkAgreement and the Increase in Wages Agreement which came into force inNovember 1947.VIII. Bilateral Negotiations33. The negotiations with the Burmese on their hard-currency requirements in the second half of 1948 have been concluded. We have agreed to a net ration of  2 million.34. Negotiations are continuing in Warsaw on trade and finance. A major issue in the discussions has been our claim for payments totalling  10 million by 1953 in respect of compensation and debts. If this can be satisfactorilyresolved, there is the prospect that Polar! d will become a useful source of supplyof a variety of foodstuffs, including bacon and eggs, over the next five years.35. Further negotiations with Argentina on trade and payments in 1949will have to take place in the near future. Senor Miranda has had to defer his visit, but may be able to come to London towards the end of November.36. Discussions are about to begin in London with a Swedish delegation on trade and payments between the two countries in 1949.37. Representatives of the Treasury, Board of Trade and Ministry of Foodare now in Madrid reviewing progress under the trade and financial agreementof last May. The over-valuation of the peseta is a serious obstacle to trade with spain, and the discussions are concerned mainly with this problem.38. When these talks are over the Treasury representative will go to Romefor financial negotiations in which we aim to get the agreement of the ItalianGovernment to the maintenance of a proper sterling/dollar cross-rate.39. The Treasury have recently had discussions in London with a Persianrepresentative in which agreement was reached on the renewal for one year offinancial arrangements between the two countries.40. A special representative of the Treasury has gone to Mexico to concludearrangements for the import of meat and sugar from Mexico against equivalentexports of certain goods in easy supply.IX.

1949-50 Programme42. Examination of the 1949-50 programmes of the participating countries is being carried on in Paris and consideration is being given to the total amountof aid to be requested. The United Kingdom view is that this should be considerably below the 1948-49 figure and in any event below $4,000 million.Four-Year Programme43. No objection having been raised to the text of the United KingdomLong-Term Programme by the Commonwealth Prime Ministers at their recent meeting, our temporary reservation was withdrawn on 19th October.44. Examination of the Four-Year Programmes of each participatingcountry is now taking place in Paris by selected representatives of other countries with a view to the preparation of a co-ordinated report. The studies are to com-prise discussion of the basic assumptions of each individual programme, thecompatibility of the various programmes with each other and the general balanceof the Long-Term Programmes as a whole. A progress report is due for sub-mission to E.C.A. on 15th November and the final report must be completed for submission by 7th December.45. The United Kingdom Programme was examined on 30th October. Themain criticism which emerged was that the United Kingdom did not provide forthe import of sufficient &apos;&apos; less essential1&apos; goods from Western Europe, while sheherself hoped to export a wide range of less essential goods to all areas; it wasnot realistic to expect that the traditional production of less essential goods in western Europe could be largely switched to essential goods within four years,and the United Kingdom ought to be prepared to accept a deficit with the &quot;other participating countries which would be used to finance their requirements fromthe sterling area. Our answer to these criticisms was that after providing for essential imports and for investment, only a very small margin remained forbuying inessential goods. If, however, the participating countries were in fact ableto supply us with more essential goods than we expected, we should be preparedto see our 1952 surplus with the participating countries turned into a small deficit.Intra-European Payments Scheme and Trade Rules46. This has now been published as Cmd. 7546. In accordance with theundertaking given to the House of Commons (O.R., 16th September, 1948, Col. 265)an &quot; Intra-European Payments Bill &quot; is in course of preparation.Loan A greement47. The agreement for the United States loan to the United Kingdom was signed in Washington on 26th October and has been published as Cmd. 7550.The amount of loan the United Kingdom will take for the period April toDecember, 1948, was finally agreed at 1310 million and not $300 million as statedin the last report.
