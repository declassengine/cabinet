HIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECEET Copy&apos; No.31CP. (48) 266Uth November, 1948CABINETCHEISTMAS FOOD BONUSMemorandum by the Minister of food at this time of year we normally announce the Christmas food bonuses. Ihave to warn my colleagues that it will be impossible to do very much this year.2.   For the first time since 1944, when the bonuses started, we shall not; be able to increase the meat ration during Christmas week.  Low stocks and theunpromising forward position would make this most unwise.3.   Nor will it be possible to issue any extra fats this year, as we have&apos; used all our available supplies for the temporary increase of the ration.4.   The best we can do is to give an extra 4 oz. of tea, 2 oz. of sweets and\ lb. of sugar (mostly Demerara) a head.   We could also double the allocations of manufacturing meat, for sausages and so on, during Christmas week, and in; addition release to retail butchers about 1,000 tons of tongues which would normally go to manufacturers.5. I realise that the proposed Christmas bonuses may seem to the housewifenot too generous for the fourth Christmas of peace, but I think we should givesomething, however small.6.   I therefore ask my colleagues to agree that I should announce at once: the extra rations and allowances set out in paragraph 4, so that distributionmay go forward.J. S.Ministry of Food, Whitehall, S. W. 1,11th November, 1948.36129Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1948
