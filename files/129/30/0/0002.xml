(48) 186).R. S. C.Treasury Chambers,14th October, 1948ECONOMIC report . Man-PowerTotal man-power in civil employment rose sharply in August by 57,000. this increase was due mainly to juveniles leaving school and entering employment forthe first time.2. The total number of persons in civil employment rose in August to19,126,000, which is 256,000 more than the number assumed for the endof 1948 in the Economic Survey. This gain in the labour force has, however,been absorbed in building and civil engineering, distribution, consumers&apos; servicesand Public Service. The basic industries (mining, agriculture, fishing, transport,shipping and public utilities) employed 87,000 more persons than at the beginningof the year but are still 36,000 short of the number assumed for the end of 1948.The number of persons employed in the manufacturing industries, after fallingfrom 7,251,000 at the end of 1947 to 7,240,000 in July, rose to 7,284,000 in august and is thus 41,000 short of the level for the end of 1948 assumed in the economic survey.

3. Employment in the metals and engineering industries fell again in july to 2,880,000 (lower than in any month since December 1947) but rose to 2,892,000in August. The number of persons employed in the textile industries has risen by 27,000 since the end of 1947 to 679.000 in August, but this is still 81,000 belowthe figure of 760,000 for the end of 1948 assumed in the Economic Survey.Employment in building and contracting in August was the same as in August1947. &quot;Under-manned Industries4. Although employment in the cotton industry continues to rise slowly,the rate of net recruitment since April has been less than it was in the first four months of this year. The number of foreign workers placed rose from an averageof 91 a week in the first quarter of 1948 to 156 a week in July but declined to 130a week in August and 66 a week in September.5. More workers were also secured in August by the cotton weaving, silkand rayon and bleaching and finishing industries. Employment in the potteryindustry rose from 71,000 to 73,000.6. After rising slowly from 725,000 in June to 725,900 in the week ended21st August, the number of men on the colliery books fell back to 724,800 in theweek ended 2nd October.U nemployment7., Unemployment in Great Britain continues to remain below the level inflie earlier part of this year. The rise in July was more than accounted for bythe extension Of unemployment insurance under the National Insurance Act.More than half of the increase in August was due to the registration of school-leavers.II. Production8. The statistics of production in July and August reflect mainly theinfluence of the summer holidays. The index of total industrial production(1946 - 100), after rising to its highest level of 124 in June, declined sharplyin July. A provisional calculation, based on a limited amount of data, shows theindex at 112 in July. This is only 5 points above the index for July 1947. Thereis some evidence that holidays were taken earlier this year, but it is not yetpossible to say whether this fall in the index was due entirely to holidays.Coal9.   The figures of coal Gutput continue to be disappointing.  Although totalEroduction of deep-mined and open-cast coal has recovered after the Augustolidays to just over 4 million tons a week in September, this is still about 5 percent, below the target for September. Total production from the beginning ofthe year to the week ended 9th October amounted to 158-7 million tons or  - 4 million tons below the target for this period.10. Output per man shift though greater than last year has not improvedsince the beginning of the year. Absenteeism has been increasing in recent months and is greater than in the corresponding months of last year.Absenteeism percentage overall1947 1948April         ............... 14-5 10-8May          ............... 9-8 10-6Juiie*        ............... 9-8 10-2July          ............... 10-5 11-7August      ............... 11-5 i3-0September^          ............ 10-9 12-8* Average of five weeksIron and Steel11. The output of steel ingots and castings recovered quickly from the effects of the holidays and has been maintained at the high level of 296,800 tons a weekduring September.   Total production of steel ingots and castings up to the end
of September has amounted to 11,064,000 tons or 2 per cent, above the rate requiredto achieve the target of 14^ million tons for 1948.12. Stocks of both pig-iron and scrap have risen to-their highest levels thisyear and are expected to increase further during October and November. Thecollection of German scrap for shipment to this country has risen from 37,400tons in January to 96,600 tons in July.Tonnage of scrap collected at German ports for shipment to the United KingdomBooty Commercial TotalJanuary ......... 34,900 2,500 37,400February ......... 36,300 3,100 39,400March ......... 37,600 2,300 39,900April ......... 37,400 15,800 53,200May ......... 27,500 32,200 59,700Tune ......... 30,600 30,700 61,300July ......... 36,400 60,200 96,600August ......... 48,700 28,400 77,100Textiles13. For the last four months the output of cotton yarn has fallen below theseasonally adjusted targets by just over 1 million lbs. a week (or 6-7 per cent.).Production fell from 17-3 million lbs. a week in June to 15-9 million lbs. a week in August owing to holidays. During the last week of August output recoveredto 17-3 million lbs. and should rise steadily to a peak in November. Owing tothe slow rate of recruitment to the industry it is, however, unlikely that output for the year will reach the target set for the industry in the Economic Survey.14. Production of woven cotton and rayon fabrics rose to a weekly averageof 49 -1 million linear yards in June the highest rate since the war but declinedin July owing to holidays. Exports of woven cotton piece goods have risen from51-3 million square yards valued at  5-3 million in January to 70-7 million square yards valued at  7-7 million in July. Exports to Canada have more than doubled since January and exports to other hard currency areas also continue torise.Exports of woven cotton piece goods from the United KingdomTotal export of woven To other hard	cotton piece goods		To Canada		currency countries		Mn. sq.

Output of passenger vehicles fell slightly to 6,994 vehicles a week iiiJuly from the record level of 7,232 a week in June. The sharp reduction to 4,389a week in August (which was confined to cars of less than 2,200 c.c.) is explained by the concentration of holidays in this month by most of the big firms. The outputof large cars (over 2,200 c.c.) rose in August to 448 a week, the highest level yetachieved. Of these, 246 a week were produced for the export market.16. Production of commercial vehicles also fell in August but the outputof public service vehicles was greater than in July.17. Exports of passenger cars to the United States and Canada are formingan increasing proportion of the value of our total exports of passenger cars.In the first quarter of the year exports to these countries were valued at  338,000a month or 7-4 per cent, of the total of  4,575,000 a month. In July they had risen to  1,457,000 or 26-5 per cent, of the total of  5,489,000.

British exports rose in July to a new record of  145-6 million. Thevolume of these exports is estimated at 149 per cent, of the average 1938 level.July was a long month and exports declined in August to  130-5 million or133 per cent, in volume of 1938. This fall in the value of exports was, however,less than between the corresponding months of 1947. The value of exports inSeptember is provisionally estimated at  131 million or 32 per cent, greater thanin September 1947.. 19. The value of imports (c.i.f.) also rose in July to a record level of 185-6 million but declined in August to  173-8 million lower than in any month since February 1948.: 20. Table 12 shows that there was a further improvement in exports of textiles and clothing in July and August. The average monthly rate of exports ofcotton textiles rose to  12-53 million in July and August only 4 per cent, belowthe target for the end of 1948.21. The net drain on our reserves (which, henceforward, it is proposed tocall the total gold and dollar deficit) amounted to  29 million in September. Thiswas somewhat higher than in August and a good deal higher than in July, whichwas, however, an abnormally low figure.22. For the third quarter as a whole the deficit was  76 million;  31 million less than the deficit in the previous quarter, which in turn was  40 million lessthan in the first quarter. The progression,. therefore, has been satisfactory, butit would be unwise to assume that it is likely to continue downwards at the same rate. There is evidence that our expenditure on dollar imports in the thirdquarter fell below the amounts programmed by Departments and it is probablethat some of the shortfalls will be made good in the next few months.23. During the third quarter we received  41 million from the United StatesEconomic Coroperation Administration, in reimbursement of expenditure incurred by us in both the second and third quarters. Together with the sum of  22 millionreceived in the second quarter this brought the total of actual cash receipts to 63 million. This compares with the allocation to us of E.R.P. funds in bothgrants and loans of  100 million in the second and  83 million in the thirdquarters, making  183 million in all. By the end of September, therefore, anamount of  120 million was still outstanding in the shape of monies provisionallyallocated but not yet received by us. As soon as this backlog begins to be made up our holdings of gold and dollars, which have been falling because currentoutlays have exceeded reimbursements, should rise substantially. It is worthy of note that E.R.P. aid allotted in the six months ending 30th September, i.e., 183 million, was exactly equal to the actual gold and dollar deficit. In principle,therefore, and, on the assumption that we shall receive all that is outstanding,the reserves have.been maintained at their level of early April.IY. Balance of Payments

For the first time for almost a year there was no rise in the index of import prices in August. The index for food, drink and tobacco was unchangedin August and there was a negligible change in the price indices for raw materials and manufactured articles.25. The price index of United Kingdom exports, after remaining almostunchanged for four months, rose by 4 points in August to 255 (1938 = 100).-Wholesale Prices26. The steady increase in the Board of Trade index of wholesale prices(1938 = 100) from 169 in February 1946 to 219 in June 1948 appears to have been arrested at least temporarily. The index fell slightly in July and August to218. This fall was due mainly to a reduction in the index of cotton prices from402 in June to 370 in August which more than offset the further advance in theindices for coal, iron and steel and non-ferrous metal prices. The index fellagain in September to 217 due mainly to seasonal changes in food prices:Retail Prices27. The Ministry of Labour&apos;s Interim Index of retail Prices was unchangedin August at 108 (June 1947 ^ 100). The index for food prices declined by almostone point and this offset further increases in the price indices for clothing,household durable goods and fuel and light.Prices in the United States and Canada28. It is still uncertain whether American prices have reached their peak.The index of wholesale prices in the United States rose by only one point to 215(1938 = 100) in August. The index of wholesale farm products, however, declined from 286 to 279 and Moody&apos;s index of staple commodity prices (31st December,1931 = 100) has declined from 434 at the end of July to 424 at the end of august and to 407 at 11th October.29. The rate of increase of the index of Canadian wholesale prices has beengradually slowing down since the begininning of the year and the index for Julywas not significantly greater than in June.VI.   Wage Rates30. The index of weekly wage rates (June 1947 = 100) for all industriescombined, which rose to 106 in June, remained unchanged in July and August.31. Increases in wage rates which became&quot; effective in August as a resultof agreements reached during the month or earlier added approximately  87,000to the weekly wage bill of 550,000 workers. This increase is the smallest in any month this year.
32. The 5s. a week increase for engineering workers recommended by theCourt of Enquiry is being considered by the two sides of the engineering industryand has been accepted by the employers. The most important of the new claimspresented during August is the claim by the National Union of Railwaymen fora flat increase of 12s. Qd. a week for all salaried and wage grades employedby the Railway and Hotels Executive and for certain grades employed by theLondon Transport Executive.33. The National Union of Mineworkers have raised with the national coal Board the question of providing for a sliding scale relating wage rates to the Interim Index of Retail Prices.- Only four industries of major importancehave a sliding scale arrangement building, boot and shoe, hosiery and iron andsteel. The adoption by the coal mining industry of such a link with the Index of retail Prices might have repercussions especially in the other nationalised industries.YII. Bilateral Negotiations34. Since my last report an agreement has been concluded with Peru. Thisagreement has removed Peru from the American Account Area and placed tradewith Peru on a sterling basis.35. Discussions with the New Zealand Delegation on butter, cheese and meatcontracts have been concluded successfully.36. Negotiations are continuing in Rangoon on Burma&apos;s hard-currencyrequirements in the second half of 1948.37. The Anglo-Russian trade discussions are being pursued in London.Both sides have tabled their requirements and export availabilities, and a sub-committee has begun to review the progress of the December Agreement.38. After protracted negotiations, a trade agreement with Yugoslavia hasbeen initialled; but it has been made clear to the Yugoslavs that its validity will depend on the successful conclusion of negotiations on financial matters (includingcompensation for British interests taken over in Yugoslavia) which are stillgoing on.39. An agreement with the Supreme Commander, Allied Powers, on trade between Japan on the one hand and the principal Sterling Area countries onthe other is nearing completion in Tokyo.   This trade will be on a sterling basis.40. Negotiations with Denmark on trade and financial questions for theyear beginning 1st October, 1948, were concluded successfully early in September.Arrangements provide for exports to Denmark of some 1 - 6 million tons of coal,500,000 tons of coke, 60,000 tons of iron and steel and  4 - 9 million of petroleum products. In return we are to receive 60 per cent, of Denmark&apos;s exportable surplus of butter at 321s. Qd. per cwt. and not less than 90 per cent, of her export-able, surplus of bacon at 225s. per cwt. The range of future bacon prices wasalso agreed upon, and there are to be further discussions before next April onthe question of a long-term contract for butter.41. There have been further meetings of the Anglo-Italian Economic Com-mittee (26th July) and of the Anglo-French Economic Committee (30th August-2nd September) to review trade and payments.42. A delegation has arrived in Warsaw for trade and financial discussionwith the Poles. It is hoped to reach agreement on Polish indebtedness, on compensation and on long-term arrangements for food supplies from Poland.43. Senor Miranda is expected to arrive in London in the middle of october to discuss Argentine meat exports to the United Kingdom, and it is probablethat the talks will broaden into general negotiations on Anglo-Argentine tradein 1949. &quot; &quot;YIIL-European Recovery Plan44. The following Programmes have now been put in O.E.E.C. inParis : (i) 1948-49 Programme.(ii) 1949-50 Programme.(iii) Four-Year Programme.
1948-^49 Programme45. This has how been revised in accordance with the Division of Aid figureof $1,263 million. In the recent discussion in Washington the Economic Co-opera-tion Administration accepted the inclusion Of $169 million calculated as the dollar deficit of the non-participating sterling Area (already included in calcula-tions which led to the allotment to the United Kingdom of aid of $1,263 million).E.C.A. have, however, stated that they will not accept the figure of $52 million(also included in the calculation of the $1,263) in respect of gold and dollarpayments to non-sterling non-participating countries. We propose to arguethis further.1949-50 Programme46. This assumes substantial progress towards the objectives of the Four-year Programme. The United Kingdom deficit on current account with the whole world in 1949-50 is estimated at $806 million and the current account deficitwith the Dollar Area (including Canada and Newfoundland) at $965.Four-Year Programme.47. The United Kingdom Programme was the only one to be submitted bythe due date, namely, 1st October. It sets out how we propose to achieve viabilityby 1953. It assumes : (a) An increase of exports to 150 per cent, by volume of 1938.(&amp;) The maintenance of imports at 80-85 per cent, of pre-war.(c) A high level of industrial investment in the United Kingdom.(d) Rapid development of home agricultural, steel and coal output and otherexport or import-saving industries.(e) Promotion of economic development in the Colonies and other countries of the Commonwealth.(/) No large-scale re-armament; no American depression; adequate E.R.P.aid in the next three years; successful European co-operation.48. The Four-Year Programme has been submitted provisionally and is notfinal until it has been discussed with other members of the Commonwealth at theforthcoming Meeting of Prime Ministers. It will be studied in Paris in con-junction with the Programmes of other Participating Countries when these are received.Intra-European Payments Scheme and Trade Rules49. The Convention establishing the Payments Scheme, and the Trade Rulesare to be submitted for final approval by the Council of O.E.E.C. at an early date.The net deficit of the other Participating Countries with the Sterling Area as awhole was estimated at $491 million; of this, the United Kingdom has undertaken,to make sterling grants equivalent to $282 million, divided as follows : FranceItalyAustria   ...Bi-Zone  ...French ZoneGreece$ million200252546^10312Belgium (receipt)        ...      ...      ...      ...        30282The balance of $209 million will be financed by existing methods, particularly the drawing down of sterling balances.50. During the discussions in Washington E.C.A. agreed that the scheme should not operate in such a way as to cost us gold or dollars by giving debtorcountries the right of automatic transferability of drawing rights. E.C.A.retains, however, the right to review dollar aid in the light of the working of thePayments Scheme and other circumstances.
Loan Agreement -    :,. 51. The Loan Contract has not been finalised at the time of writing, butthe following terms have been agreed: interest 2^ per cent.; loan to mature in35 years from 31st December, 1948, with tapered semi-annual amortizationpayments starting on 30th June, 1956; no interest to be payable until31st December, 1952. There is provision for waiver of interest and principal, bypostponement only, in exceptional economic circumstances. The amount of loanthe United Kingdom has agreed to take for the nine months April-December 1948is $300 million.Investment Guarantees52. Under Section III (b) (3) of the Foreign Assistance Act, E.C.A. is authorised to make guarantees up to a total of $300 million to firms makinginvestments in Participating Countries, covering the convertibility of their foreign currency earnings into dollars up to the total amount of their dollar outlay.Such guarantees would only be granted with the agreement of the ParticipatingCountry concerned. The dollars for this purpose will have to come out of the dollar allocation of the country in question so that no additional dollars will beavailable as a result of the scheme. The only project which we have so farapproved for a guarantee is one for the manufacture of Carbon Black, the totaldollar interest in which is about  150,000.Stockpiling53. The United Kingdom has agreed, under Article V of the UnitedKingdom-United States Economic Co-operation Agreement, to supply to theUnited States Government materials for stockpiling to the maximum extentcompatible with our domestic and commercial requirements. An E.C.A. Missionvisited Europe in September to discuss stockpiling matters generally with theGovernments of Participating Countries. A contract has been signed for thesale by the United Kingdom of 26,000 tons of rubber, the cost of which is to be met from the 5 per cent, of the Special Account set aside in accordance with Article IV, 4of the Agreement. Sales of industrial diamonds and sisal have also been charged to this account. The question of increased production of manganese in the gold coast is now being discussed in Washington with the African ManganeseCompany.
