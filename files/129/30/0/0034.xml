document IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET&apos;CP.(US)26U10 TH NOVEMBER,  1948CABINETREPEAL OP EIRE EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY (external relations) ACT,  193b:    EFFECT ON special privileges ACCORDED TO EIRENote by the Lord Chancellor&apos;At the meeting of the Cabinet on the 28th October,(C.M.(h8)67th Conclusions, Minute 3) I was invited,  in .consultation with the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General,  to consider and report whether, after the repeal of the Eire Executive Authority (External Relations) Act,special privileges granted to Eire and her citizens insuch matters as trade preferences and freedom fromaliens restrictions could be defended against challengeby Foreign Governments based on &quot;most-favoured-nation&quot;clauses In Commmercial Treaties;    and, in particular,whether the grant of trade preferences to Eire wouldbe safeguarded by the Geneva General Agreement on Tradeand Tariffs.I circulate, for the consideration of my colleagues,a memorandum which I have prepared in consultation withthe Solicitor-General.      It has not been possible, in thetime available,  to consult the Attorney-General.J.COPY NO.V 213House of Lords,  S.W.I.10TH NOVEMBER,   1948.
memorandum the repeal by the Eire Government of the executive authority (External Relations) Act, 1936, would, we think,have the result that Eire would become, for the purpose of most-favoured-nation Treaties,  a &quot;foreign country&quot;.      it then becomes material to consider what would be thesituation of the United Kingdom under the terms of suchtreaties so far as her obligations are concerned to accord to the countries, with whom she contracted privileges in trade matters and the treatment of their nationals notless favourable than those which she at present accords to eire.      It is also a matter for consideration whether her obligations in this respect to such countries would be inany way modified in consequence of the provisions of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,  and,  If and whenit is accepted by the necessary number of countries,  ofthe Havana Charter.In our view:-(i)    Under the terms of the bilateral Most-favoured-nationTreaties by which she is bound,  the United Kingdom would be under an obligation to accord to the countries with whom she has entered into such treaties no less favourable advantages,both in the matter of preference rates and the right of entry to this country of their nationals,  than she at present-accords to Eire, unless such advantages are withdrawn by theUnited Kingdom from Eire.(ii)    Her obligations under those treaties to countrieswhich were not signatory to the General Trade Agreement orthe Havana Charter would not be affected by the provisionseither of the General Agreement on Trade or the HavanaCharter.(iii)    So far as the signatory countries to the general trade Agreement and the Havana Charter are concerned,  theUnited Kingdom would be entitled to continue to accordpreferences to Eire5  such preferences not to be higher thanthose prevailing on 10th April,  19h7 (unless these had beenscaled downwards) without being under an obligation toprovide similar preferences to the other countries which became signatory to or accepted the General Trade Agreementor the Havana Charter (vide Article 1 and Annex A of theGeneral Trade Agreement and Article 16 and Annex A of theHavana Charter) .(iv)    What is stated in (iii)  above must be read subjectto this qualification,  that if,  in order to avoid breach ofany of her bilateral Most-favoured-nation Treaties,  theUnited Kingdom accorded under those treaties to any of the.countries parties to them preference at the rates accorded to Eire,  the countries which had accepted or becomesignatory to the General Trade Agreement or the HavanaCharter could claim that similar preference rates shouldbe accorded by the United Kingdom to them.(v)    With regard to the treatment of the nationals ofthe countries parties to bilateral Most-favoured-nationTreaties with the United Kingdom,  the obligations of theUnited Kingdom would be in no way affected,  either by the
&apos;General Trade Agreement or the Havana Charter,  but would depend entirely upon the provisions of the Most-favoured-nation Treaties.      These provisions vary in form,  the treaties themselves having been entered into at various timesover the last two centuries and earlier.      In general, however,f the United Kingdom would, if Eire became within the meaning of such -treaties a foreign country, either have to apply to eire citizens the ordinary machinery of aliens&apos;  controlapplicable to persons of foreign nationality,  or would haveto allow citizens of countries to whom the United kingdom was bound by Most-favoured-nation Treaties to enter and remain in this country upon similar terms to those applicableto citizens of Eire.It would appear from the conclusions set out above thatthe position with regard to trade advantages is affected bythe General Trade Agreement and the Havana Charter, but theUnited Kingdom&apos;s obligation with regard to treatment of the nationals of countries to which she is bound by Most-favoured-nation Treaties depends entirely upon their terms.So far as trade questions are concerned,  the GeneralAgreement on Trade and the Havana Charter,  in almost identicalterms., provide by their provisions as to Most-favoured-nation treatment that the United Kingdom is to accord to contractingcountries the same privileges as she accords for the products of other countries.      This is subject to the qualificationthat the United Kingdom can continue to accord, to certainnamed countries set out in Annex A to the Agreement and the charter preferences not above the level prevailing on10th April, 1947. unless such levels have been scaleddownwards.      Eire,  therein referred to as Ireland,  is one ofthe countries named in Annex A.      If,  therefore,  the GeneralAgreement on Trade and the Havana Charter stood by themselves,there would be nothing, we think,  to prevent the UnitedKingdom from continuing such preferences not in excess of the ceiling mentioned to Eire without according similar preferencesto other contracting countries.      The rights,  however, of countries other than such contracting countries under bilateral Most-favoured-nation Treaties with the United Kingdom,  are unaffected.Those countries,  therefore,  could insist that,  so far as theywere concerned.,   the United Kingdom should accord them the sametrade advantages as she accords to Eire,  if she in factcontinues so to do.      This would have the indirect resultthat If,  for example,  the United Kingdom,  in order to complywith such a bilateral Most-favoured-nation Treaty,  accorded toa foreign country not a party to the General Trade Agreementor the Havana Charter trade privileges such as those enjoyed by Eire,  the countries who were parties to the General trade agreement and the Havana Charter could claim that they were entitled, under Article 1 of the General Trade Agreement and article 1.6 of the Charter,  to the same trade privileges asthe united Kingdom accorded., to that other foreign country.In substance,  therefore,  if Eire becomes, a foreign country,but nevertheless continues to enjoy her existing preferences,the United Kingdom would have to accord similar preferencesnot only to countries with whom she is bound by bilateralMost-favoured-nation Treaties, but also through so doing would find herself obliged to accord similar preferences to thecountries who were signatory to tho General Agreement on trade and the Havana Charter.
r.  216It would therefore be accurate,, we think,   to state thatthe United Kingdom,  except for a few protective and revenueduties, could have virtually no tariff because everyimportant country would have to be granted, the almost universalfree entry now enjoyed by Eire.    &quot;We therefore think that thedraft reply prepared by the Secretary-of state for commonwealth relations (See CP..(48)262) does accurately state on page 2the position so far as the trade conseauences of Eire becoming a foreign country are concerned.      Wo suggest that the reference to the United States as a country with which theUnited Kingdom has a bilateral Most-favoured-nation treaty should be excluded,  since the United States is also asignatory to the General Trade Agreement.      The references,however,  to Denmark and Argentina can remain.We also think that the -passage of the draft which dealswith the effect,  if Eire became a foreign state,  of anyattempt   to treat Eire citizens otherwise than as aliens, isaccurate.      It can, we think,  fairly be said that if theUnited Kingdom honoured the obligation that she would be underto other foreign countries with whom she has entered intoMost-favoured-nation Treaties,,  the system of aliens&apos;  control -?/ould be virtually undermined.We would,  however, suggest a change in the wording onpage 1 of the draft which at present reads;    &quot;the United KingdomGovernment, who had given the position preliminary consideration,have been advised that the Eire Executive Authority (external relations) Act,  1936,  is the sole constitutional link whichbinds Eire to the British Commonwealth,  and that if that Actis repealed, Eire would cease to be a member of the Commonwealth.and would become a foreign state...&quot;      In view of the proposal that India should be,  so far as possible,  regarded still as amember of the Commonwealth and not as a foreign country,although she declares herself a sovereign independent republic,reliance being placed for this purpose upon general worldrecognition and the numerous subsisting ties between Indiaand the countries of the Commonwealth, we think it unwise to stress that in the case of Eire the Executive Authority(External Relations) Act,  1936,  is the sole constitutionallink which&apos; binds Eire to the British Commonwealth.      It wouldbe more difficult in the face of such an assertion to maintain that the declaration by India of her sovereign independence asa Republic would not have a similar effect,  and be as farreaching in its results.     We would suggest that the passageshould read;-&quot;...have been advised that if the Executive Authority(External Relations) Act, 1936, were repealed, Eirewould cease to be a member of the Commonwealth andwould become a foreign state in relation to the UnitedKingdom and all other Commonwealth countries.&quot;Otherwise, we think the draft reply is a correct statementof the position so far as its.legal implications are concerned.10th November, 19U8
