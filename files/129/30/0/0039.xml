COPY OF TELEGRAM ADDRESSED TO THE PRIME minister by THE PRESIDENT OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY&quot;^    THEUNITED NATIONS &apos;&quot;THE RIGHT HON. G.R. ATTLEE,  10, DOWNING STREET,  LONDON.The Secretary General and I are handling to theChairman of your Delegation at the third regular session ofthe United Nations General Assembly for transmittal to you a communication urging implementation of the resolution of theGeneral Assembly unanimously adopted on 3rd November, 1948,entitled &quot;Appeal to great powers to renew1 their efforts tocompose their difference and establish a lasting peace&quot;.I hope for your most earnest and sympathetic considerationof this communication with special and immediate reference to the berlin crisis, the continuance of which has been and still is an active obstruction to the work of the General Assembly, indoedthe Berlin dispute is seeping into the very structure of this organisation.    There are of course a number of ways in which,this dispute may be settled.   The recent Security Councilproceedings nearly resulted in the settlement which waspreceded by negotiation.    Therefore the matter might againcome before the Security Council.   Alternatively you might consider that other and more direct methods of h-powernegotiations might well be tried with regard to the overwhelmingnecessity of settling not only the Berlin dispute but the peaceitself-   I have always taken the view that a much closer association with the great powers of other nations that duringthe war contributed men and material unstintingly to the common cause, the common enemy, would have assisted the Council ofForeign Ministers and facilitated the making of the peace.Finally there is the important question of personal contact,personal trust and personal confidence and comradeship betweenthe leaders of the great powers.   I want to assure you thatthe Secretary General and I will be entirely at your service and disposal in any positive steps you may think would be helpful.Our single desire is to forward the purposes and principles ofthe United Nations, which the peoples of the world intenselydesire to see translated into action.Herbert V. Evatt.   President of theGeneral Assembly.13th November, 19h8
