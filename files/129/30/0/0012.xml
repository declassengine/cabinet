C g E C R E TCP. (Ml .2U22 2ND OCTOBER,  194.cabinet-  SITES OF THE -PERMANENT HEADQUARTERS OP THE food and iiGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION AND THE international trade ORGANIZATIONMemorandum by the President of the ,.Board. of Trr.trade at their meeting on 7th November, 19h-6 (CM. (h.6) 95thConclusions, Minute 2) .at which the location of various international agencies was discussed,  the Cabinet took thefollowing decision&quot;That the headquarters of the International TradeOrganization and the Pood and AgricultureOrganization should be located together,  and thatit was undesirable that the headquarters of theformer should be in the United States&quot;.2.      Trie question of the site of the P. A. 0.  is to be discussed at the forthcoming meetings of the P. A. 0.  Council andConference and I understand that my colleagues the ministers of Agriculture and Pood, hove asked for views on theinstructions to be given to the United Kingdom Delegation.Since,   in the past,  the sites of the P. A. 0.  and the I. T. 0.have been considered together,  I suggest that the following considerations should be taken into account before a finaldecision is reached.COPY NO.3.      The chief reason against  the United States as a site forthe headquarters of the I.T. 0. , apart from the important oneof expense,  is the wish to avoid undue pressure of U. S.business interests on the policy of the Organization and an undue preponderance of U. S.  economic  theorists among thestaff.    I suggest that the primary consideration in determining the site of the I. T. 0.  is that it should be in Europe.-h.      It is expected that the I.T.O.  will have many close tieswith the P.A. 6.   and there might be some advantage in the headquarters of the two organizations being located near eachother.    At the same time,   the I.T.G.  will also have to work closely with other organizations - e. g.   the United Nationsitself,  the Economic and Social Council, and its regional commissions,   the International Monetary Fund,  the international bank and the International Labour Organization.    Many of theseorganizations are in fact already located in the United States,but in ray view this should not prevent the I.T.O.  frommaintaining the necessary contacts from a European site.    i suggest therefore that the former decision that the headquarters of the I. T. 0.   and the P.A.O.   should necessarily be locatedtogether should now bo revised.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)
5,      But it is impossible to ignore the fact that the morespecialized agencies with economic functions are located inthe United States the harder it may bo to obtain a Europeansite for the I. T..0.    From this point of view the choice ofa European site for the F. A. 0.  would be preferable.    IfWashington were to be chosen at this session as the site of the F. A. 0.   this would certainly have an adverse, possiblydisastrous,  effect on the choice of a site for the I, T,0.,since while we do not ourselves regard proximity of the. twoheadquarters, as essential,   the Americans would certainlyargue that it was.   if F./.. 0.  had already been established in washington.6.      On the merits of the case also it seems to me that thefinancial advantage of either of these sites,  together withthe desirability of avoiding too much American infiltration in thestaff of the F. A. 0.   (a danger which is liable to increaseafter the change of Administration which will inevitably freea number of the present officials of the U...S. Department ofAgriculture for other posts;  are decisive in favour of a european site for the F.A. 0.    The main political objectionadvanced icet   that the Americans and the Canadians would prefer the F. A.0.  in Washington - is not one which,  in my view,  should weigh heavily.    &quot;Wo shall be faced with similarobjections so far as the I.T.O.  is concerned, but we should certainly not regard them,   in that context,  as overriding.7c      When it comes to deciding upon a site for the I.T. 0.the United Kingdom will certainly have the res-ponsibilityof organizing support for a European site,  and other european countries will look to us (as the French,  for instance,evidently do in the case of F. A. 0. )  to take the lead, in that way.    It will certainly make our task more difficult, whenthe time comes,  if the United Kingdom,  in spite of the knownwishes of other European countries, has voted for Washingtonfor F. A. 0.0,      Both on the merits of the case as far as the F. A. 0.   isconcerned and from the point of view of repercussions onthe choice of a site for the I. T, 0. ,  I would strongly recommend that the delegation vote for a European site(preferably Copenhagen)  for F. A. 0.   at the forthcomingmeetings.    If it appeared unlikely that a majority of theConference would support Europe,  our delegation might thenseek postponement, at the same time making it clear to the americans privately that we should not,  even at a later date,  be prepared to support Washington unless we hadassurances from, them that they would support a Europeansite for the I, T. C.    I would urge that our delegation shouldnot in any circumstances support &quot;Washington at this meetingunless they con obtain similar assurances, which,  in their judgment can bo relied upon in the future.    I do not thinkit will bo possible at this stage to get such assurances:and I therefore consider that the instructions should inpractice be summarized as voting in the following order ofpreferencei-(l)    Copenhagen(3)Postponement (with a private notification to the americans about the I.T.O.  along the lines indicated).H.W.cord of Trade,Miilbank, S.W.1.22HD OCTOBER,   19A
