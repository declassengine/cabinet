THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF.HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENT--- ------ 46...    Printed for the-Cabinet.   October 1948SECRETCP. (48) 237ISth October, 1948CABINETTHE AFRICAN conference memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies think that Ministers will wish to have a brief account of the AfricanConference held at Lancaster House, which completed its work on 9th October.The Conference was unique of its kind in two ways; no such regional meeting had ever previously been held; nor had the unofficial representatives of so manyColonial territories ever before been gathered in London. Everyone who attended the Conference was agreed as to its outstanding success.2. The members of the Conference were drawn from the Legislative councils of all the African territories for which I am responsible. A few of the members were senior officials from the Colonial Service, in most cases one from each territory, and they made a very special contribution to the smooth workingof the Conference. The vast majority of the delegates, however, were unofficials,Africans from the West African territories and Africans, Indians, Arabs and europeans from the East and Central African territories. The total number of delegates from Africa were 66 of whom 12 were officials and 33 were Africanunofficials.3. Official observers attended the Conference from France, Belgium,Portugal, the Union of South Africa, Southern Rhodesia, the Sudan and the SouthAfrican High Commission Territories. The United States and India also sentobservers informally.4. The delegates were received by The King on 8th October and were deeplyappreciative of this honour. They were entertained at dinner by the Governmenton the same day. Much other hospitality was shown them, including a receptionby the Lord Mayor of London on 4th October.They have seen something of the country and of local government, agricultural and other institutions, and they have this week visited Birmingham or Bristol.5. The illness of the Prime Minister prevented him from speaking to theConference and delegates sent their warm wishes for his health. The conference was opened on 29th September by the Deputy Prime Minister, who spoke onthe general aims of our colonial policy. I am indebted to him and other ministers who attended and made important contributions to the discussion. The conference was addressed by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster on the economic position as it affects the Colonies, by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations on the Commonwealth in world affairs, by Lord Montgomery on africa in relation to world strategy, and by Lord Trefgame on the work of the colonial development Corporation. I also addressed the Conference on problems and policy.6. The Conference discussed the general economic position and the meansof development in plenary sessions on the basis of papers prepared in the ColonialOffice which had been circulated in advance. Two points were made in the economic discussions : (a) The desire of the Colonies to play their full part in United Kingdomand world economic recovery.   The delegates dismissed the idea thatthe present economic policy of the United Kingdom towards the35999CopyNo.31
Colonies was a cloak for. exploitation of the Colonies in theinterests of the United Kingdom, and recognised its vitalimportance to their own development But there was sometimesa fear lest, when the immediate demand for increased production ofcertain dollar-earning and dollar-saving commodities became less acute,&apos; the local industries would be left to their fate without protection andwithout adequate markets.(&amp;) Whether, notwithstanding the critical shortages of capital and consumer goods, the Colonies were really getting their fair share at the presenttime.On the first point, it was useful to be able to refer to the recent statement ofpolicy on long-term contracts, and to be able to explain the Colonial Office efforts of the past year or so to build the machinery for coping with economic planning and furthering the economic drive. On the second point, statistics were availableto show that, in fact, the Colonies are getting a larger share of United kingdom exports than before the war. They were also told of new arrangements recently introduced which should be of material assistance in accelerating and increasingthe supply of essential requirements next year. These arrangements, even whenfully effective, will not, of course, give the Colonies everything that they want:so long as the shortage continues that is impossible. But I am satisfied that itwill give them a fair share, provided that the Colonial Office has the full collabora-tion and support of the other Departments of the United Kingdom Governmentwhich, in fact, control the supplies. The opportunity was again taken to impress on the delegates from Africa the necessity of using scarce materials to the best possible advantage.7. Regional sessions of the West African delegates and the East and central african delegates respectively were held to discuss agricultural development,public relations, medical policy, educational policy, community initiative, andlocal government, also on the basis of Colonial Office papers circulated in advance.I need not give an account of these lengthy discussions, but I can say that broadly speaking the present policy of the Government as set out in the Colonial Officepapers was acceptable to the delegates from Africa. I should add, however, thaton local government the Conference accepted as a basis for policy the lines onwhich we have been working for some time. The latter have been fortified by theconclusions of the conference on this subject held at Cambridge in August 1947(when the practical problems of local government in Africa were exhaustivelyconsidered by about eighty Colonial Service officers from the field) and the endorse-ment given to them by the Conference of the Governors of African Territoriesheld last November. We now have the broad basis of a generally accepted policy to work on.8. The achievement of the Conference was not so much in the conclusions reached in the discussions, useful although these were, as in the friendly rela-tions established between the delegates from the different territories and betweenthe representatives from Africa and Ministers, officials and others in this country.The Colonial Office was able to learn much from the delegates and I believe thatthe delegates themselves learnt a great deal from all that they heard at the meetings. This was the first time that people from East and West Africa havebeen brought face to face in discussions and social gatherings of this kind. Allthe delegates were able to see that, although each region has its own problems,yet there are many vitally important problems which are common to Africa asa whole and must be viewed in a broader perspective. Those delegates who mayhave been apt in the past to take too parochial a view were able to see their own affairs against the background of the wider Commonwealth and world picture.Above all, delegates had a striking demonstration of the interest taken by thepeople of this country in African problems and the friendliness of people heretowards the representatives of Colonial Territories. There is no doubt that theywere all very deeply impressed by this interest and friendliness and the Conrference has certainly done much to increase the goodwill between this country andthe African Territories. Eloquent expression was given to these feelings both atthe official dinner on 8th October and at the closing of the Conference on 9thOctober. One of the most gratifying aspects of the Conference was the realevidence it afforded of the trust and confidence, underlying all doubts anddifferences, felt by the delegates of all races in the Colonial Office and its objectives.9. The quite admirable arrangements made at Lancaster House and else-where for the sessions of the Conference and the reception of delegates contri-
buted very largely to this result, and I am greatly indebted to the Foreign OfficeConference Department, the Ministry of Works, the Ministry of Supply officialcar services pool, and the Government Hospitality Fund for their co-operation.10. It is obviously too early yet to consider plans for future Colonial Con-ferences of this kind, but their value was endorsed by everyone taking part inthis one.A. C.
