THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENTThe circulation  of this  paper has been  strictly limited. &quot; 218It is issued for &quot;the personal useHOP SECRET Copy No.hiCP. (48) 26516TH NOVEMBER,  1948GAB I NETCYRENAICAMemorandum by the Chancellor&apos; of the Duchy of lancaster. In accordance with the cabinet&apos;s decision on 11thNovember (CM. (48) 70th Conclusions, Minute 3), a meeting ofthe Ministers directly concerned has been held, under my chairmanship, to examine the draft Trusteeship Agreement forCyrenaica, and other documents, annexed to CP. (48) 261.The Minister of Defence was unable to be present, but I under-stand that these documents are acceptable to him.2. We have the following comments on the draft Trustee-ship Agreement:-Article 4We consider that,  in order to avoid exposing toowide a field for the discussions on this draft in the Trustee-ship Council and the General Assembly,  it would be advisable to omit the specific references to the proposed Treaty and constitution from this Article.      The Article would then reaas follows:-&quot;In order to promote the political advancement ofthe inhabitants of Cyrenaica, the Administering authority is authorised to recognise His Highness the Amir El SayedMohammed Idris El Senussi as Amir of Cyrenaica and Headof the Government of that territory with executive and legislative authority subject to the terms of thisAgreement.&quot;As, however, this was a matter of tactics rather than substance,the views of the United Kingdom Delegation in Paris were obtained on this suggestion, and they agreed with the proposed amendment.We therefore recommend the adoption of the revised form of thisArticle proposed above.Article 5We were informed that this Article fully meets theneeds of the Service Departments.Article 6This Article provides that the Administering Authority&quot;shall take all necessary steps to ensure ecjual treatment in social, economic, industrial and commercial matters for all members of the United Nations and their nationals&quot;.      Thisprovision is common to all Trusteeship Agreements and, whatever its practical disadvantages, we should not be supported, even bythe United States,  if we proposed to omit it on this occasion.
3- Subject to the amendment of Article U as proposed above, we recommend that the Cabinet should approve the draftTrusteeship Agreement annexed to CP. (W) 261,h-. The following further documents are annexed toC. P. (1+8) 261 :-(i)    The draft of a Treaty (with military annex) to be concluded with the Amir of Cyrenaica.(ii)    The draft of a Financial Agreement with the Amir.(iii)    A draft Constitution for Cyrenaica.There is no obligation to submit these documents for theapproval of the United nations, and we do not consider thatthey should be made public,  or- communicated to anybody except the Amir,  unless the General Assembly approves the draftTrusteeship Agreement.      It would, however, be necessary,  indue course, to include them in the annual&apos; report which,  underArticle 1h of that Agreement, the Administering Authority isrequired to submit to the Trusteeship Council.5&apos; Subject to the following comments, we recommend thatthe Cabinet  should approve these documents also:-Draft TreatyAlthough it is believed that the terms of the draft treaty will be acceptable to the Amir, no time limit is set forthe restrictions imposed by Article V on his powers of independentaction,  and we may, therefore, be criticised for failing to offerany genuine hope of self-government to Cyrenaica.      We under-stand, however,, that the General Assembly will almost certainlyinsist on placing some time limit on the operation of the trusteeship Agreement, in which event an   automatic limit wouldbe placed on the duration of the Treaty.Draft Financial AgreementWe suggest that the words &quot;as the^r are eventuated&quot;should be deleted from Article III, Section (i).Draft Constitution(a) Article g.      The use of the phrase &quot;adequate compen-sation&quot; might provoke claims based on the property owner.&apos;sconceptions of adequacy, and we think it would be preferable to use a different term,.such as &quot;appropriate compensation&quot;.(b) Article 1+0.    Moslem opinion is normally unsympatheticto female suffrage,  and we do not think that provision for complete adult suffrage will commend itself either to the Amiror his people.      We therefore suggest that the implications ofthis Article should be clearly explained to him and that, if hepresses for the restriction of the suffrage to men, we should give way on this point.      This concession may not be whollyacceptable to the United Nations, but it will be easier todefend if it is made in deference to the Amir&apos;s views.6. The Governments of India and Pakistan have shown a close interest in Cyrenaica;    and the former, which is stronglycritical of all forms of colonialism, is expected to resist theproposal for a United Kingdom trusteeship.      We recommend thatthe Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations should be
authorised to inform these Governments at once of the broad outline of our proposals;    we do not think, however, that itwould be necessary or desirable for him to give them theactual texts of any of the documents in advance of publication.7. We therefore recommend:-(1)    That, subject to the above comments, the cabinet should approve the Draft Trusteeship agreement for Cyrenaica, the Draft Treaty (with MilitaryAnnex), the Draft Financial Agreement and theDraft Constitution,  all circulated with c. F. (48) 261.(2)    That the Draft Trusteeship Agreement should not bemade public, or communicated to anybody except the Amir, until it is laid before the general assembly;    and that the documents other than the trusteeship Agreement should not be made public,or communicated to anybody except the Amir, unlessthe General Assembly approves the Draft trusteeship agreement.(3)    That the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations should be authorised to inform theGovernments of India and Pakistan immediately ofthe broad outline of our proposals, but shouldnot show them the text of any of the documentsconcerned.H. D.Privy Council Office, S. W. 1.16TH NOVEMBER,  1948.
