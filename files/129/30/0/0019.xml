iTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)\ c1(SECRET COPY NO.CP. (48) 2,11.9,2nd November, 19U8.CABINETNORTH ATLANTIC TREATY AND WESTERN union memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will want to be informed of and toconsider the proceedings of the Consultative Council last week,in Paris.      In addition to the transaction of much currentbusiness with which I need not trouble the Cabinet, two important problems were discussed:    the proposed North. atlantic treaty and the future development of Western Union.NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY2. As the result of a British initiative the UnitedStates and Canadian Governments agreed that this project shouldbe explored on an official level by representatives of theUnited &quot;States, Canada and the Brussels Powers.     Afternegotiations in F/ashington, a document laying down the linesof a North Atlantic Treaty was produced on 10th September   andwas submitted to each of the Governments concerned.      this paper,  under cover of a meraorajadum from myself (D.0.(48) 64),was considered and generally approved by the Defence Committeeon 7th October (D.0.(48) 17th Meeting, Minute 1).    The canadian government signified their approval of the project on 17thOctober.3* When the matter came before the Consultative Councilon 25th October, the Council was invited to consider three main questions:(a) Whether the Brussels Treaty Powers are in principleprepared to conclude an Atlantic Pact;(b) If so, which countries should be invited to attend a conference;(c) Which country should issue the invitations to sucha conference.4. I explained that I favoured some form of regionalpact covering the Atlantic, and that an American assurance of support for the Brussels Treaty was not enough.     What was required was some form of treaty arrangement with the UnitedStates and with Canada, who had already signified that theywere willing to meet the Western Powers for the purpose of concluding a treaty.      The whole question of a treaty was 0delicate matter, since it would not necessarily be easy to reconcile the views of the Western Powers with those of theUnited States and Canada.      I felt that the problem should be approached in the same spirit as the Marshall Plan had been,in other words, on a basis of self-help by the Brussels Treaty
Powers.      The idea should he to create some coherent- defence system so that the five Powers would not only stand on theirown feet militarily, but would maintain their independence and prestige.      In addition, as far as we ourselves were concerned, it would be, of course, necessary for us to maintainexi /ting obligations towards the Commonwealth.     The objectiveshould be to mobilise the wealth and productive capacity ofthe North American Continent for the defence of Western Europe.The Americans had already passed the Selective Service Actand the Senate had approved the Vandehberg Resolution.      Ithad been suggested that a Presidential Declaration in supportof- Western Europe might meet the needs of Western european defence.      I did not think that this was so, for the reason that such a declaration was not constitutionally binding andwas only valid for the Presidents period of office.      In anycase nothing could be expected until the American electionshad been held.      In the meantime the Brussels Powers mustprogress resolutely in building up the regional defencearrangement as a deterrent against possible aggression.5* If it were agreed.that a treaty were necessary, the consultative Council need not go into details at once, but before negotiations started experts of each of the western european countries concerned should consider the Annex to theWashington document and decide how it should be interpreted,and what modifications, excisions or additions were, desirable.Our objectives must be clearly defined before conversations with the United States could start.      In this connection, itshould be borne in mind that, although the European Powersmust&apos;necessarily hold the front in case of aggression, it wasnot possible for Great Britain to repeat the role that she hadplayed in 191L, and 19)40.      In 1911+ she hod, together with her allies, helped to hold the front, and in 19I+O she hod stoodalone.      But with modern air forces and weapons there was astrong possibility that Great Britain might be immobilised by air and projectile attack.      For these reasons it was essentialthat everybody should be brought into the war at the samemoment.     The security of Vtfestern Europe required a regionalpact which committed the trans-Atlantic as well as thecontinental Powers.     Everybody must act as one and resisttogether.      If this were known, potential aggressors mightbe given pause and the necessary basis for discussions for the  .maintenance of peace might be created.6. Hitherto- the Powers of1Western Europe had beendisunited, not so much in spirit but in their economic and defence arrangements.      This had led Soviet Russia to assume that her potential adversaries could be dealt vi/ith one at atime.      The basis of effective defence of Vilestern civilisationwas for the resources of all the defenders to be put in the pool, economically as. well as militarily.7, So far as the Commonwealth was concerned, theposition had been discussed during the recent conference inLondon;    the Commonwealth countries, except Canada, were not directly committed or involved, but they understood thenecessity of the Western European Powers drawing closer together.      There had been indeed a great feeling of unanimityand a general acknowledgment  of the real menace whichthreatened us in the east and west.      It was therefore necessary for Great Britain to keep all the commonwealth countries informed of what arrangements they wer*e making forthe integration and defence of Western Europe.      In general .it could be said that the Commonwealth supported the idea ofa North Atlantic.Pact.
8.. The Foreign Ministers of France, the Netherlands,Belgium and Luxembourg agreed that a treaty with the UnitedStates and Canada was necessary.&apos;    The French and BelgianForeign Ministers had had certain hesitations earlier, asthey feared internal reactions in their own countries to sucha treaty, hut now the position had changed radically,,     TheUnited States and Canada hod made it plain that they reallywanted a treaty,  and it would he a terrible responsibility foranybody to discourage the conclusion of such a treaty now withall its advantages.9*       ,      As regards the question who should be invited to aconference for the framing of such a treaty, I felt that inthe light of the difficulties that would arise if the question were debated there and then,  it would be better to settle themain question and to leave these subsidiary problems to bedecided later.     For instance, if Italy were invited thequestion of the provision for the security of Greece and turkey would inevitably arise;    if the Scandinavians were invited, there might be delay, since they had indicated that they wanted more time to consider Scandinavian defence arrangements first.     for strategic reasons the United States Government desire to includeIceland, Portugal and Eire in the proposed Atlantic Pact.      Asregards the latter it seems possible that if invited to join,the Irish might raise the partition question.      I should perhapsat this point add that the Danish, Norwegian and PortugueseGovernments have been apprised in confidence of the result ofthe Washington conversations so that on invitation to participatewould not take them by surprise.     The Portuguese reaction wascautious but not unfavourable;    the Danish and Norwegian Governments,  however, expressed a desire for delay on the groundsmentioned above.10.  . It was important,  however, to remember that the UnitedStates and Canadian requirements would differ in some respects from those of the Brussels Treaty Powers.      The FrenchGovernment, for example, are anxious to restrict the number ofparticipants so,as to avoid dissipating the available resources,whereas the United States Government favour the inclusion of allNorth Atlantic Powers and attach particular importance to the.participation of Norway and Denmark (because of the strategic importance of the Norwegian airfields and of Greenlandrespectively).11.     -        It was agreed that it was important that no time should be wasted.and that in the circumstances the possibledifferences amongst the Brussels Treaty Powers themselves and between them, and the United States and Canada on the questionof participation should be dealt with later.The Consultative Council accordingly agreed unanimously -that the United States and Canadian Governments should   ;be informed forthwith that the Brussels Treaty powers were now prepared to enter Into a Treaty with the.United States and Canadian Governments on north atlantic defence;that each Government should within ten days of the -date of the formal communication referred to in (1;above send instructions to its representative on thePermanent Commission concerning the attitude to beadopted in respect of the detailed proposals laiddown in the. Annex to the Report of the washington talks; &quot; -   . .12.
(3)    that, in view of the foregoing agreement, thequestion who should issue the invitations lapsed.  for the time being.13* The representatives of the five Powers in washington and Ottawa have been instructed to make a concerted approach to the United States and Canadian Governments on these lines.His Majesty&apos;s Government have therefore to consider now whatinstructions to impart to the United Kingdom representative on the Permanent Commission.Recommendations ;.1h* The Cabinet are recommended to approve the action taken hitherto and the instructions on the following lines tothe United Kingdom representative on the Permanent Commission.(a)    The United Kingdom representative should approve theconclusion of a treaty on the general lines of the annex to the Report of the Washington Talks.(b)&apos; He should, however, express the view that the treaty should not cover economic, social and cultural -aims, but only those relating to defence.      If  ,necessary he might agree to a general reference to   -the common heritage of Western civilisation in the preamble, but should oppose articles calling forthe establishment of special machinery for theconsideration of such questions.(c) He should suggest that in due course, in addition tothe Brussels Treaty Powers, the United States and canada, Eire,  Iceland, Portugal, Norway, denmark and if possible.Sweden should be sounded&apos;as to their readiness to accept an invitation to a conference forthe framing of the treaty.(d) He should argue against the inclusion of Italy inthe first instance,  though it should be made possiblefor her either to adhere, to the treaty in somecapacity at a later date, or,  if the Americans insist,for her to send a representative to the conference insome distinctive capacity, but only on the under-standing that some provision is made for the securityof Greece and Turkey-(e) He should argue that the exact footing on which Italyand any country other than those named above couldenter a treaty should, be .decided at the conferenceitself. &apos;(f) He should suggest that if the attitude of any of thecountries approached proves likely to delay theconclusion of the treaty,  that country should be dropped from the list of participants.(g) He should suggest that the United States should beasked to take preliminary steps to convene aconference as soon as the domestic situation inAmerica allows it..Arguments15, The readiness of the United States and canadian government&apos;s to enter into binding military commitments in
Europe represents o notable revolution of thought both inAmerica and Canada.      Without such a trans-Atlantic commitment,Western Europe would risk having for the third time toconfront an aggressor whilst the United States were slowlygirding themselves for the fray.      Moreover, without a treatyit would be difficult if not impossible to secure the deliveries of arms or to arrange the advance military planning in peace-time which are essential to Western security.16. The United States and Canadian Governments seem to favour including in the treaty provisions for economic,social and cultural collaboration.      It would in my view bea mistake to risk duplicating the work of the Organisation for european Economic Co-operation and the Brussels Treaty machinery,which is beginning to work; well.      The point, however, does not seem of capital importance, and if later our attitude isviolently opposed by the United States and Canadian Governments,it may be necessary to go some way to meet thenu  provided that nothing is done to weaken the existing machinery of theOrganisation for European Economic Co-operation and the brussels Treaty.17 The Americans and Canadians, with some reason,attach great importance to the participation of Norway and denmark and, perhaps to a lesser degree, of Iceland, Eire and portugal.      If all or any of these.countries prove willing toparticipate, it would be difficult to find good grounds foropposing their inclusion.     Neither the Americans nor the canadians are likely to be impressed by the French argument that our limited resources must be concentrated entirely on thedefence of the Rhine.      There is, of course,  little doubt thatthe defence of the Rhine should hove priority and the americans are likely to recognise this.      But they will argue that thedistribution of available resources will be decided by theGovernments on the advice of their military advisers and thatthe Western wor\Ld should not be deprived of the political and strategic advantages flowing from the participation of these other Powers simply because the French Government wish to bethe sole recipients of American aid.18. The position of Italy raises great difficulties.The Americans set some store by Italian participation.     Onthe other hand, the Military Committee of the Brussels Treatyhave expressed the opinion that, while the inclusion.of italy would be useful from a purely strategic point of view, theshortage of military supplies and the limitations imposed bythe Peace Treaty would make her a. liability at present.      Butthey recommend that the question should be kept in mind as thesupply position improves.      Secondly,  as pointed out above,Italy cannot well be included unless provision is made forthe security of Greece and Turkey.      Finally, there is in italy to-day a strong public sentiment in favour of neutrality.The Italian Government would therefore probably feel driven torepresent their participation as a favour to the Western world,a favour which would have to be requited by revision of thePeace Treaty, by Colonial concessions and by a large share ofany material aid given by America.      On these grounds it seems desirable that Italy should not be one of the POwers sounded inthe first instance.19. In handling all these matters it is important toensure that nothing should delay the convocation of theconference and the conclusion of the treaty.      The tide is nowflowing in our favour and we must take it at the flood.Otherwise delays may lead to doubts and so to the collapse of the
whole project.      On these grounds I recommend that anycountries whose attitude proves likely to cause delay shouldhe at once discorded.     Their accession con, if necessary, bearranged at a later stage.   .20. Finally,  since the Washington exploratory conversations took place ostensibly as the result of theVandenberg Resolution and the declarations of the President,it seems appropriate that the conference should take placein America and that the United States should make thepreliminary soundings and issue the invitations.     the conception of a North Atlantic Treaty has been widely canvassedin the United States, where it has been regarded as an Americaninitiative.      The circumstance that the idea originated in thiscountry is not known except to a very narrow circle of officials who have been careful not to reveal it.     There has beenvirtually no articulate opposition from the public, the pressor Congress.      If this state of affairs is to continue, there ismuch to be said for allowing the United States G-overnment tocontinue to appear to be taking the initiative.DEVELOPMENT OF WESTERN UNIONStatement of the Case21. For some time now&apos;His Majesty&apos;s Government have beenunder increasing pressure to agree to some further,  and ifpossible, some demonstrative move tending to reinforce western union.      This pressure has come partly from France,  partly from america and partly from active elements in this country on both sides of the Houses      The Hague Conference last Junefocused   a great deal of the very general feeling that some such move must now be made, and though it is true thatsubsequent to the conference many divergencies of view began to manifest themselves in the ranks of the European &quot;Federalists&quot;,nevertheless there is still strong sentiment in favour of theFrench proposal for a &quot;Consultative Assembly&quot;, more particularlyperhaps in France, where the constitution of some such body would undoubtedly hove a favourable effect on the prospects ofthe present Government,  and assist it in its struggle against theCommunist and the Gaullist raanaces.      As for the Americans, thereis no doubt that the predominant feeling in the United States idthat the democracies of Western Europe ought to enter into somecloser association, and this notion was vigorously emphasisedby Governor Dewey himself during his recent Presidential campaign.There are clear signs that Mr. Dewey intends to use the european recovery Programme as a lever to compel the closer integration of Western Europe.      In.consequence, we cannot ignore thepossibility that if no further advance is made, the effect onthe credits which ore to be voted next February may be considerable.22, In point of fact,  the achievements of the past yearrepresent a notable advance towards European unity,  and T haveno doubt that the method of steady and gradual progress would bethe right way to bring about even greater unity in the future.Unless therefore we are to adopt a purely negative attitude,with unfortunate consequences in America, France and elsewhere,it seems essential to devise some scheme which will satisfy thedemand for a move and at the same time ovoid any commitment tothe dangerous expedients advocated by the Federalists and their allies.    -Such a scheme should represent an orderly developmentof the general conception underlying the Treaty of Brussels.23. It was with this object that towards the end ofSeptember I suggested to the Prime Minister and to one or twoof my colleagues that some regular meeting of responsible
Ministers of the Western European countries might be&quot; considered,and after some discussion I put forward a -proposal on thefollowing lines:-(a) . The new scheme would he for a meeting which might be termed &quot;A Council of Ministers of Western Europe&quot;which would meet at stated intervals,  perhaps twicea year, and be composed of governmental delegationswith advisers from each of the countries concerned.The exact Ministerial representation would vary with:   circumstances and with the. items on the agenda of theCouncil.(b) If this proposal were accepted,  steps would be takento create an adequate secretariat, and the intentionwould be to run the &quot;Council of Ministers&quot; on rathersimilar lines to the General Assembly of the united nations,  though of course on a much smaller scale.Thus any reports which would be placed in front ofthe Council by any of the organs established underthe Treaty of Brussels might be referred,  in theevent of any divergence of view, to committees and sub-committees for investigation and report;    andan effort would thereafter be mode to achieveagreement on the basis of full discussion in theCouncil itself.(c) The proposed new system might be subsequentlyextended so as to permit the participation of any german or Western German Government.     .There wouldin fact be nothing to prevent a German Delegation fromsitting in at the Council, though it might well notbe possible for that Delegation to take any part inthe discussion of certain subjects,  such as those relating to defence or foreign policy.      The somemight be said in regard to possible Italian repre-sentation, and indeed it might be that the difficultyof admitting Italy to the&apos;Treaty of Brussels mightbe overcome by associating her with the proposed&quot;Council of Ministers&quot; rather than by her accession to the Treaty of Brussels itself.21+. Such a system would go a long way towards spikingthe guns of those who wish to frame a Constitution and whocriticise His Majesty&apos;s Government for not going fast enough in the direction of &quot;Western Union&quot;, while at the same timepreserving in effect the full sovereignty of the participatingStates and in reality adopting the basis of the so-called&quot;empirical&quot; approach. rather than the alternative basis of someformal &quot;Constitution&quot;.25. There was some discussion of this matter with the -Commonwealth- Prime Ministers,  and it will be recalled that inthe minutes of the meeting held at 11 a.m.  on 19th October(P.M.M.(48) 9th Meeting) I am recorded as saying that &quot;the time would shortly come when it would be advisable to hold generalmeetings attended both by the Foreign Ministers of the signatory (Brussels) Powers and of the members of the functionalcommittees.      Experience had proved the difficulty of isolatingspecial problems and this appeared to offer a better means ofobtaining&apos;effective collective decisions&quot;.26. As I understood it, none of our Commonwealth colleagues had any particular objection to such a&apos; development,  and that being so,  though I could not put it forward officially, I did .moke 0 general allusion to my scheme at the meeting of the
Consultative Council on 25th October.     This was done, ofcourse,  partly with the desire to deflect attention from therival Franco-Belgian proposal for a Consultative assembly which was on our agenda, and partly because I am convinced that only by some such approach as I have suggested are we inpractice ever   likely to solve&quot;the vexed problem of theassociation of Italy with other European democracies, ,and above all the even more difficult and urgent problem of the eventualassociation of Germany with Western&apos;Europe.21* In the subsequent discussion I detected a sense of relief on the part of M. Schuman that my suggestion had beenmade,  and indeed I was informed by M. Chauvei afterwards thatM. Schumon for his part would be only too willing to take myscheme in preference to his own official one if he could persuade his wilder &quot;Federalist&apos;1 colleagues that only by suchacceptance was any progress ever   likely to be made in thedirection of a closer unity which would include Great Britain.In any case,  seeing, that we were now in possession of more thanone suggestion, the Butch proposed, and it was subsequentlyagreed, that the sensible thing to do would be to set up aCommittee&apos; to examine both these suggestions, and indeed any othersuggestion that hod been or might be mode,  and report back totheir Governments at an early date.28. The Consultative Council accordingly reached thefollowing conclusions unanimously:-(a) that a body should be set up to study the problemof closer union in Europe in accordance with the ..   discussions of the Council;(b) that the body should make recommendations, to governments;(c) that the representatives on the Committee should beappointed by Governments;(d) that the membership of the Committee should be 5French, 5 British, 3 Belgian, 3 Dutch and 2 Luxembourgmembers;(e) that it should meet in Paris;(f) that the Committee should-study the geographicalscope of any steps that it might recommend and,if it considered desirable, might put forwardvarious alternatives;(g) that the meetings should be held in private;(h) that the report of the Committee should not bepublished until presented to Governments, who wouldtake joint decisions in matters    of publicity;(i) that the Committee should report by. the next meeting&quot;&apos;of the Consultative Council.*Recommendation29. I ask my colleagues -(a)    to approve in principle my proposal for a &quot;European.Council&quot; as outlined above,  and
(b)    to approve the agreement reached in Paris that the.., five Brussels Powers should appoint a Committeeof Enquiry to examine all proposals for greaterEuropean unity and report to Governments.Arguments30. The case against adopting a  purely negative attitudehas already, been stated in this-paper, but there are some general considerations affecting the position of the French&apos;Government to which I should like to call the attention ofmy colleagues,31* There is, I fear, no doubt that the present FrenchGovernment and indeed the whole French nation are in a&apos; parlous state.      On the side of the public there is 0 generalapathy,  a leek of confidence and an absence of any sense ofcivic responsibility, while the Government for their partshow little capacity to give leadership,  to tackle the problemsof the day and to inspire public confidence.      In consequencethings ore drifting dangerously.   -  Yet it is probably truethat France is economically in a better position than thiscountry and that if a French Government were to show the someresolution as we have done,  they would find that their road torecovery was easier and less painful than ours.     What isrequired is the necessary moral effort;    and it is even now not too late.     The repugnance of the nation to the extremes of communism and Gaullism have given the present Government a prospect of life which they have scarcely deserved.32. I have been carefully considering what can be done tofortify and stimulate the French Government, for we must recognisthat France is essential to the Western system and that hercollapse would involve the collapse of the whole.      While wecannot hope to regenerate France from this side of the Channel,there are two things we can do.      First, we can help to promote the revival of the French Army.     -At present, memories of theGerman occupation are so lively that the defencelessness ofFrance has a demoralising effect on the whole body politic,which can be likened to creeping paralysis.      It may be that aconsciousness of reviving strength and growing confidence inthe capacity of France to defend herself with her Allies may help to restore the national self-respect,  the loss of whichis at the root of France&apos;s present troubles.      Secondly, weshould continue to do all we can to give the French people a sense of political solidarity with the other Western Notions.This has been our policy since the beginning of the year and wehove already seen its beneficient results,-     Without the Treatyof Brussels, for example,  it would not have been possible to induce the French Government to take the risk of associatingthemselves with us in Western Germany or still less of backingus in the Berlin dispute.      The state of France is bad, but without the sense of solidarity created by the Brussels Treatyit would be worse.      This is recognised in France and the factaccounts for the widespread desire to forge closer bonds withthe countries, of the West, even to the extent of full Federation.With the French in this frame of mind it would be dangerous to throw France back on herself by rejecting out of hand herproposals for closer union.      Hence the proposals I have putforward.      They are designed to avoid the constitutional andother pitfalls prepared by the Federalists, but represent theminimum which con be safely offered if we wish to fosterpolitical solidarity in the West.E.B.Foreign Office,  S.W.1.2nd November, 19M-8.
