DRAFT OPENING SPEECH, 1948-49 SESSIONTuesday, 26th October, 1948my lords and members of the house of commons :1. The Session beginning to-day opens in a troubled world still sufferingfrom the ravages of war. To spend all our energies on repairing these ravageshas been our constant desire, but&apos; we have been hindered by distrust anddissension between the nations. Yet, with mutual confidence and goodwill, theproblems now besetting us would not defy solution, and the peoples of the world would be able to live in peace and enjoy the fruits of their labours. Meanwhile,as the recent meeting of Prime Ministers and their representatives in Londonhas shown, the peoples of My Commonwealth offer a shining example of voluntary and useful co-operation.2. My Government will continue to work closely and harmoniously, withinthe framework of the Treaty of Brussels, with the other Governments whichare parties to it; to give full support to the United Nations, and to strive to fulfil the aims of world peace and well-being set forth in the Charter.3. In the Western Zones of Germany, economic revival has begun. Currencyreform has brought stability and renewed faith in the value of money. TheGermans themselves are working hard to design a democratic constitution for western Germany.But in Berlin the Soviet Government, in pursuit of their own political aims,have arbitrarily cut all land communications with the west. My Governmenthold the view that this action constitutes a threat to peace and have therefore been constrained to refer the matter to the Security Council of the United Nations.Meanwhile, Berlin is being supplied by air; and aircraft from the UnitedKingdom, some of them flown by crews from other Commonwealth countries, arecombining with those of the United States to keep Berlin linked with western europe.4.

My Ministers are taking steps to ensure that My Armed Forces shall be efficient and well equipped, and that the best use shall be made of men called up under the National Service Act. - Recruiting for My Regular Forces will be stimulated, and My Reserve and Auxiliary Forces will also be built up.
