THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS   BRITANNIC  MAJESTY*S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1948SECRETCopy No.31CP. (48) 2598th November, 1948CABINETREPARATIONS AND THE EUROPEAN RECOVERY programme memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on 15th October the Cabinet considered and approved the proposals con-tained in a memorandum on Reparations and the European Recovery Programme(CP. (48) 234). I think my colleagues will wish to know of the events whichhave taken place since then and of the position reached in our discussions withthe Economic Co-operation Administrator, his adviser on reparations matters,Mr. Humphrey, and the members of his team of investigators.2. Following the Cabinet meeting I wrote to the United States Ambassadoras at Annex A, confirming that: (i) His Majesty&apos;s Government would co-operate fully with the HumphreyCommittee with a view to facilitating its investigation into the possi-bility of retaining in Germany in the interests of the european recovery Programme plants at present scheduled for reparation.(ii) There would be no dismantling of items of equipment in &apos;&apos; unreleasedplants which could not be re-erected in Germany.(iii) Until 15th December no dismantling would be started at &quot; unreleased &quot;plants at which it had not already begun.(iv) If the United States Government could arrange for the Inter-AlliedReparations Agency to agree to the withdrawal of plants allocated to the Agency which Mr. Humphrey had been instructed to examine,we would treat them, in the same way as &quot;unreleased&quot; plants asregards dismantling.3. I explained to Mr. Douglas that these commitments were undertaken onthe assumption that Mr. Hoffman would urge Mr. Humphrey&apos;s committee togive priority in their examination to those plants where dismantling has alreadybeen started and to prepare as soon as possible a list of plants which could bemade available for allocation, and further that before any examination of plant was conducted in the British Zone a press statement would be issued explaining the nature and scope of the investigations.4. The French Government, when informed of the terms of my letter toMr. Douglas, expressed full agreement subject to a reservation with regard to paragraph 2 (iv) above.5. At subsequent meetings in Paris and London, the American representa-tives were assured that it was the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government tocarry out the terms of my letter to the United States Ambassador in good faith and that the British staff in Germany would co-operate fully with Mr. Humphreyand his colleagues. British officials would be fully informed of the anxietiesof the Americans with regard to the dismantling of &quot;unreleased&quot; plants, anddismantling operations would be carried out with common sense and in the spiritof our undertaking. If any particular dismantling activity seemed likely to embarrass the Americans in their relations with Congress, it would be investi-gated and, if possible, remedied. Mr. Humphrey also accepted a suggestion thatone of his representatives should visit the Headquarters of the Inter-AlliedReparation Agency at Brussels to obtain information on plants from the O.E.E;C.countries which hope to receive them as reparations.36103b
6. I was later informed that these assurances were acceptable &quot;to the UnitedStates Government. They were recorded in a minute which has been handed to the United States Government as a record of a meeting (Annex B). Thepress communique, the text of which is attached at Annex C, was issued bythe French, United States and British authorities on Wednesday, 27th October.7. These arrangements are a delicately balanced compromise between twoirreconcilable views our own view that if dismantling stops it will neverget started again, and the American view that any dismantling while the examina-tion of the Humphrey Committee is in progress is liable to expose the UnitedStates Administration to devastating attacks in Congress. I consider that wemust give this compromise a trial, but it remains to be seen whether it willwork smoothly in practice; and I propose to keep both our dismantling procedures and our whole reparations policy under very close review in the next few weeks.If the present arrangements give rise to administrative or political difficulties,I may have to ask my colleagues to consider a more radical approach to thewhole problem later on.8. Meanwhile, I think it would be common sense to stop at once the dismantling of any plants in the British Zone which are under review by theHumphrey Committee and which we ourselves consider should be left in Germany,without prejudice to their eventual consideration on an inter-governmental basis.I attach at Annex D a list of plants which in the view of the British military governor might be treated in this way. I think it probable that these plants,some thirty-five in number (of which twelve are being dismantled), are likelyto be included among those which Mr. Hoffman may eventually recommend forretention in Germany.9. Dismantling at most of these plants has not yet reached an advanced stage, and in order to avoid both wastage of labour and material in dismantlingand also future criticism that we have acted unreasonably in not anticipatingthe Committee&apos;s recommendations in obvious cases, I think we should be preparedto authorise the Military Governor at his discretion to suspend dismantling atthe plants forthwith. I recommend that we should not formally announce thatwe are taking this action and, if questioned, should state that it is an adminis-trative arrangement based on our desire to avoid wastage or possible embarrass-ment to the United States Administration while the review of the HumphreyCommittee is in progress.Recommendation10.   I therefore ask my colleagues- (a) to note the agreement which has been reached on the basis of CP. (48) 234and the action taken to implement it;(6) to authorise me to suspend forthwith dismantling at the thirty-five plantslisted in Annex D whenever such action may appear appropriate.V E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1, .8th November, 1948.ANNEX a text of Letter dated 16th October, 1948, from the Secretary of State to, :&apos; the United States ambassador in the course of our discussions on 13th October, Mr. Hoffman asked forreconsideration in the light of the European Recovery Programme of the repara-tions and dismantling programme of the British Zone which has hitherto operated on a basis of agreement in connection with the level of industry, and in co-operation with the other Governments concerned. He made certain specific requestsregarding co-operation with the Humphrey Committee which he has appointed and dismantling in the British Zone. I undertook to examine the technical impli-nations of the proposals we discussed, to submit them to the Cabinet, to consult with the French Government and to notify the United States Government of theposition of His Majesty&apos;s Government at an early date.
I am now writing to you as. arranged, after having obtained the views &quot;ofmy colleagues, after consultation with the French Government, and after a pre-liminary technical&apos; examination of the dismantling problem. Mr. Hoffmanrequested that His Majesty&apos;s Government should, so far as the British Zone isconcerned, co-operate fully with the Humphrey Committee with a view tofacilitating its work of investigation both in the British Zone and elsewhere intothe possibility of retaining in Germany, in the interests of E.R.P., plants at presentscheduled for reparations. I confirm that His Majesty&apos;s Government is ready toco-operate fully with this investigation and I take this opportunity of re-affirmingmy anxiety that it should be completed at the earliest possible date. I understandthat the Committee will be asked to maintain close contact with British representa-tives as its work progresses. Such contact will be warmly welcomed by HisMajesty&apos;s Government and every effort will be made to ensure that co-operation and contact will be as effective as possible.Mr. Hoffman requested that continued dismantling in the British Zone shouldbe of such a character as will not prevent the eventual retention in Germany, inthe interests of E.R.P., of any plants under review by the Humphrey Committeeexcluding those already allocated by I .A.R.A. I am prepared to go so far as Ipossibly can to meet this request. On the basis of the technical examination whichhas already been conducted I am able to give an assurance that there will be nodismantling of items of equipment in unreleased plant which cannot be re-erected.In particular no blast furnaces under examination by the Humphrey Committeewill be dismantled. I am also prepared to give an assurance that priority asregards the use of labour will be given to the dismantling of released plantswherever this can be done. I would add that our experts would be glad toexamine with United States experts the practice of dismantling in the UnitedStates Zone with a view to seeing whether there are any methods which could be usefully adopted in the British Zone in order to give further effect to the objectiveswe both have in view. I also confirm the undertaking given in the letter whichI sent to Mr. Marshall on 1st October that no new dismantling shall begin atany of the plants under examination by the Humphrey Committee where it hasnot yet started until 15th December, by which date I hope that the examinationwill have been completed.I must, however, enter one caveat in connection with the plants, which accord-ing to Mr. Hoffman numbered twenty-two, which were released for allocation last june but which the Humphrey Committee, on instructions from Congress, hasbeen asked to re-examine. There is some doubt on the part of the experts aboutthe exact identity of these plants, but the following is based on the assumptionthat they are identical with twenty plants in this category of which the state department gave particulars to the British Embassy in Washington on 30thSeptember. Of these twenty plants, ten have been divided east and I am ready to treat these as regards dismantling in the same manner as plants which were notreleased in June. Two have already been sub-allocated by I.A.R.A. and I under-stand that these are not covered by Mr. Hoffman&apos;s request. There are, however,eight further plants which have been made available to I.A.RA. but not as yetsub-allocated. On three of these dismantling has begun. I consider that it would prejudice the relationship between the Military Governor and I.A.R.A. if theseplants were to be withdrawn unilaterally. I shall, however, be ready to arrangefor these plants to be treated in the same way as unreleased plants if the UnitedStates Government can arrange for I.A.R.A. to agree that they should be with-drawn from allocation.The foregoing commitments are entered into by His Majesty&apos;s Government onthe understanding that Mr. Hoffman will urge the Humphrey Committee to give priority in their examination to the plants on which dismantling has already started and to give early attention to preparing a list of plants in which they haveno further interest in order that such plants can be made available to I.A.R.A.for allocation. I also understand that before any examination of plants is conducted in the British Zone a press statement will be issued in agreed terms explaining thenature of the investigation, emphasising its limited scope and duration and thefact that subject to its findings the reparations programme, including any plantsmade available for reparations as a result of the intergovernmental discussions nowin progress concerning the prohibited industries, is unaffected and will be broughtto as speedy a conclusion as possible.It might be well if finally I were to confirm my understanding of the procedure for the investigation now being conducted by the Humphrey Committee.   Iunderstand that when this committee has completed its investigation, it will report36103 B 2
to&apos;Mr. Hoffman. Mr. Hoffman will then examine the report and reach his con-clusions about the plants which in his view should be retained in Germany in theinterests of E.R.P. These conclusions will then be forwarded by him to theUnited States Secretary of State who will communicate with the British andFrench Governments with a view to seeking their agreement as provided inSection 115F of the Economic Co-operation Act; and the conclusion will not becomebinding upon His Majesty&apos;s Government until that agreement has been sought and obtained.ANNEX BTelegram from Foreign Office (German Section) to Berlin(Secret) 23rd October, 1948Addressed to Berlin telegram No. 3025 Basic of 23rd October, 1948, repeated,Saving, for information, Paris, Washington, Detmold, Frankfurt, Brussels, Lub-becke and Paris (U.K.D.E.L. to O.E.E.C.).My immediately preceding telegram No. 3022, Basic.Dismantling and E.R.P.Mr. Humphrey raised the question of commitments regarding the dismantling-programme contained in Mr. Bevin&apos;s letter to Mr. Douglas. He said that he hadno change to suggest in the letter itself, but had certain misgivings and wantedcertain assurances. He understood that plants at which&apos; dismantling had notstarted would not be dismantled. He wanted to feel sure that no basic steel equip-ment would be dismantled. He was concerned lest there should be serious criticism on the lines that plants might be dismantled in Germany which would subsequentlyhave to be re-erected with loss of time and money and all at the cost of theAmerican taxpayer. He would like to feel sure that the work of dismantlingwhich continued at the plants under review would only be of such a character as would not prevent those plants from being reinstated with a relatively small lossof time or money in the event that it was decided that they should be retained inGermany.2. In the course of the discussion the United States Delegation were assured that their objectives and anxieties would be fully taken into account in theoperation of the dismantling programme. The assurances regarding that pro-gramme given in Mr. Bevin&apos;s letter would be faithfully observed. Mr. Whitham,Chief of Reparations Deliveries and Restitution Division, who had been present atthe meetings both in Paris and in London and was fully familiar with UnitedStates views, would use every endeavour to ensure that the programme was carriedout in such a way as to avoid any of the more serious consequences which theUnited States Delegation feared. It must be recognised that, while Mr. Whitham&apos;sdivision could not undertake to supervise in every detail work being performed by17,000 Germans, he would take special steps to make known to the United Kingdomstaff concerned the anxieties of the Americans with regard to the dismantling ofunreleased plants and make every effort to ensure that dismantling operations wereconducted with common sense and in the spirit of the undertaking.ANNEX CPress Communique Issued in Agreement with French and United states government on 27th October, 1948Since the reparations programmes covering the three Western Zones ofGermany were published in October and November 1947 the European recovery programme has come into being and is now^ vitally affecting the progress of recovery. The Governments of France, the United Kingdom and the UnitedStates have therefore had under consideration the desirability of ensuring thatthe reparations programmes are still fully consonant with the needs of european recovery. It has been agreed by the three Governments that there is a need toexamine certain portions of the reparations lists with a view to determiningto what extent some plants on those lists might better serve the needs of European
recovery if left in Germany than if removed and re-erected elsewhere.- pursuant to Section 115F of the United States Foreign Assistance Act, a preliminaryreview of the lists has already been made by the United States Government anda list of plants which require more detailed study has been drawn up. The further review of these plants will be conducted by the Industrial Advisory Committeeof the Economic Co-operation Administration maintaining close touch with officials of the other two Governments concerned who will co-operate in every way.It is hoped to complete this review within a few weeks. Further plants will bemade available to I.A.R.A. for allocation as rapidly as possible while thisinvestigation is in progress.The review is being conducted from the standpoint of European economic recovery and not with the object of bringing about any general readjustment ofthe reparations programmes. It is intended by the three Powers that subject to whatever deletions from the reparations lists may be agreed as a result of this review the balance of the reparations programmes shall be brought to a speedyconclusion.ANNEX DList of Plants suggested by the Military Governor for retention inGermany in the interests of E.R.P.A.
