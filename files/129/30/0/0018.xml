IPHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (h8) 2k81st November, 19U8.COPY NO.CABINETOFF-SHORE OIL IN THE PERSIAN GULPMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs wish to consult my colleagues on an urgent problemaffecting British interests in the Persian Gulf which &apos;has ari...enout of the increasing anxiety of British and American petroleumcompanies to exploit the oil which,  there is every reason to suppose, exists under the sea-bed of the Persian Gulf, andwhich the resources of modern engineering now render it possibleto obtain.      In these circumstances the oil companies are showing a competitive interest in requiring concessions covering the petroleum rights of the Persian Gulf.      Our position in theGulf makes it important to ensure that matters are arranged in the most orderly way possible.2. The States concerned are:-(i)    Persia(ii)    Iraq(iii)    Saudi Arabia(iv)    Certain British protected States, namely:- &apos;      the Arab sheikhdoms of Kuwait,  Qatar andBahrein, and the seven minor Trucialsheikhdoms of Ajman, Kalba, Dabai,  Sharjah,Ras Al Khaimah, Umrn Al Qawain, Abu Dhabi;(v) The State of Muscat and Oman, which, althoughfully independent, is in great measure under british influence.The Government under the most pressure is Saudi Arabia,which has for some time been holding in check the Arabian-American OiSuperior Oi]Corporation (British)with the object of securing a concession to exploit theresources of the sea-bed off the shores of Saudi Arabia in &apos;Persian Gulf.      ibn Saud was&apos; requested to hold up the grantof a concession until he had received the views of HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the United States Government on principles on which the whole of the sea-bed of the Gulfit is reported that he has recentlyof the Arabian-American Oildoubtful if he willfuture.beationshetheshould be divided, but it isinitialled a concession in favourCompany,  and,  if this is correct,   it is .__________ ... -be able to avoid some public announcement in the nearIt must be expected that,  unless some form of agreement can
obtained, regarding the basic principles to be applied,  anysuch announcement will be followed by similar and perhapsconflicting claims by the other States concerned.      ThePersian claim to Bahrein also complicates the issue and makes .it necessary that we should ensure that they have a properunderstanding of the problem before any claim is advanced byBahrein.recommendations i therefore recommend:-(a) That we should apply to the division of the sea-bedof the Persian Gulf the principles of President Truxnan&apos;sproclamation on the subject of the natural resources of thesubsoil and sea-bed of the continental shelf and should seekits acceptance by the other Interested parties.      In practice this means that we should seek to arrange that the sea-bedof the Persian Gulf should be divided between the Statesbordering on the Gulf by a median line drawn between the north-east and south-west shores of the Gulf,  joined by transversallines extending from the boundaries between the territorial waters of adjacent states.(b) His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom should(in the case of the independent States jointly with the UnitedStates Government, and in the case of the Sheikhdoms under ourprotection, alone) inform the- Governments concerned of theprinciples formulated in (a) above.(c) In order to avoid any possibility of Persia respondingby making immediate claims extending beyond the median linebefore the Arab States were ready to act themselves,  the approach should be made in two stages.      First, Saudi arabia and the States under our protection should be approached and given a copy of the attached draft proclamation (Annex &apos;A&apos;)with the request that they should take no action for two to three weeks, during which time we would,  secondly,  explain tothe Iraqi and Persian Governments the advice we had tendered to the other States and the reasons for it.      (We would not,however, give them a copy of the draft proclamation).Discussion3. It has always been the view of the Departments ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government that it would be most objectionable inprinciple and create endless difficulties in practice if,  inan area  say fifteen miles off the coast of State &quot;A&quot;s butnearer to State &quot;A&quot; than to any other state, State &quot;B&quot; wereto claim jurisdiction over the subsoil underneath the sea onthe grounds that its nationals were working the minerals there,and that it had acquired the sovereignty and jurisdiction overthe part of the sea-bed in question by occupation.      Occupationis a method of acquiring territory which is res nullius(i.e. belongs to no state).      The bed of the sea is res nulliusand according to the prevalent view of international law, &apos;capable of being -acquired by occupation though the sea itselfcannot be so acquired.      Consequently, it has been felt that matters must be so arranged that in the instance given above,it should be State &quot;A&quot; which should have the jurisdiction andthe sovereignty over the occupied sea-bed outside territorial waters but nevertheless off its coasts.      Holding this view,it is thought that a right principle for the solution of theproblem is embodied in the proclamation with respect to thenatural resources of the subsoil and sea-bed of the continental shelf made by President Truman on the 28th September, I9h-5j a
copy of which is annexed (Annex ,B&apos;) for convenience of,reference.His Majesty&apos;s Government have already decided tofollow the Truman Declaration in establishing british sovereignty over the sea-bed with its natural resourcesadjacent to the Bahamas and to Jamaica, up to the limit of thecontinental shelf which surrounds these islands.      The draft order-in-Council for so doing has been prepared,  though ithas not as yet been issued, because the Governors of the territories concerned seem to hove been a long time in replying to the Colonial Office letters.Although President Truman&apos;s proclamation is the mostimportant declaration on this subject,  the United Kingdom andVenezuela had previously, by a Treaty signed in February, 19U2,divided the sea-bed and subsoil of the submarine areas of theGulf of Paris   outside territorial waters.      By this Treatyeach party agreed not to assert any claim to sovereignty or control over those ports of the submarine areas lying on theother&apos;s side of the boundary, and the submarine areas renouncedby Venezuela under this Treaty were subsequently annexed toHis Majesty&apos;s Dominions by an Order-in-Council.h. On the other hand,  the application of the principleof. President Truman&apos;s proclamation to the Persian Gulf isdifficult.      In the case of the Eastern coast of the UnitedStates, as also in the case of the Bahamas and Jamaica,  theapplication of the United States principle is relatively simple.There is a continental shelf (where the sea-bed is shallow andthe depth of the water does not exceed 100 fathoms)  extending1+0 or 50 miles from the shore, followed by a drop in the oceanbed to great depths.      The place at which the sea-bed drops ismore or less clearly marked and comes at about the 100 fathomline,  and far the purposes of President Truman&apos;s declaration andfor the purposes of our own annexations in the Bahamas andJamaica, the 100 fathom limit is being taken as the extent of.the continental shelf,  and in these cases there is no doubt towhom the bed of the sea belongs by the application of this principle.      The Persian Gulf is,  however,  a shallow sea whichmay be regarded as being entirely a continental shelf.      Thereis no deep water below the 100 fathom line to form a boundary -the lowest depth in the whole Gulf is about 50 fathoms - norindeed is there any marked submarine configuration in the formof a&apos; sudden drop in the level of the sea-bed.      The United StatesProclamation itself recognised that circumstances such as these might exist, but it merely says that in these cases the boundaryshould be mode by agreement between the States concerned inaccordance with equitable principles.      The solution in this case which best carries out these principles would, be the assertionof jurisdiction over the sea-bed in such a way that the areasclaimed by the different States bordering on the Persian Gulfwould meet in the middle of the Gulf at points equidistantbetween eastern and western shores.5. The division of the bed of the Gulf is also complicated by the existence of islands, in the case of a few of which the title is in dispute,  and secondly by the fact that the boundaries on the land between the various States ore notprecisely settled.      In one area,  indeed, the boundary between .Saudi Arabia on the one hand and the British protected Statesof Qatar and Abu Dhabi on the other hand is in dispute between his Majesty&apos;s Government and Saudi Arabia,  and the disputedarea includes some coastline on both sides of the Qatarpeninsula.       Thirdly, there is the further complication thatthe British protected State of Bahrein, which is most important
from the oil point of view,  is claimed, (albeit, accordingto the advice-of the Law Officers, without any legaljustification) to be Persian territory.6. There will be available at the meeting of theCabinet at which this memorandum is discussed a map giving a rough indication of the results of dividing up the wholeof the sea-bed of the Persian Gulf by a median line drawn between the north-east and south-west shores.      The mapwill also show the transversal division of the sea-bed on thewestern side of the median line, and the place where the medianline is terminated at the north-west end and replaced by linesrunning to the Iraqi-Persian and Iraq-Kuwait frontiers.      Itmust be recognised,  however, that no proposals for dividingup the bed of the Persian Gulf, however equitable,&quot; would belikely to lead to agreement between all&apos; the States interested.In the first place, Persia would be likely again to raise herclaim to Bahrein and would try .to hold up any final agreement.In the second place, as stated above, the land boundaries arenot in all cases defined or demarcated,  and any final divisionof the waters of the Gulf would depend upon settled landboundaries.      Thirdly, the possession of certain islands is in dispute,  and lastly,  in some areas,  there is likely to be scope for disagreement as to what in fact would be on equitabledivision.7. It would seem undesirable,  however (and certainlyimpracticable),  to hold up all off-shore oil development inthe Persian Gulf pending an agreement on the division of itswaters between all the riparian states.      As the most important(though not the earliest) proclamation about subsoil and sea-bed rights was made by the United States Government and thereare very considerable American oil interests in this area,  theForeign Office have felt it desirable to consult the UnitedStates State Department before formulating their own vi ewsas to the general principles on which the division of the sea-bed of the Persian Gulf should be made.      As a result of subsequent informal discussions it has become clear that theForeign Office and the State Deportment are in general accordin the view that the basic principles to be applied should beas stated above,  subject to the considerations that:-(a) the division of the sea-bed would in no way affectthe general character of the waters outside territorial waters as high seas, or the right of free navigation therein;(b) all existing rights in regard to fishing or pearlingor any other established rights appertaining to anyriparian state must be protected and would in no way be affected by the division now proposed;(c) suitable adjustments of the division of the mainsea-bed would have to be mode to take account ofislands and their territorial waters appertaining &apos;to a state other than that off. whose shores theylie;(d) the median line must cease at a certain point in thenorth-west (closed)  end of the Gulf and there is some question as to precisely where it should ceaseand be replaced by lines radiating to the Iraqi andKuwait boundaries.
8. By virtue of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s specialtreaty position with the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf,we can ensure that their rulers will apply the principlesagreed &quot;between us and the Americans for the division of thePersian Gulf waters.      The Saudi Arabian Government- havespecifically asked for guidance and will probably act onour Joint advice.      The interest of the Government of Iraqis comparatively unimportant, hut they will appreciate thatthe problem requires an early solution,  and they will ofcourse attach the greatest importance to their own share,small as it must be, and the place where the median line isterminated is of more importance to them.      The application ofthe present principles may well occasion difficulties betweenthe Iraqi and Persian.Governments, but this is a risk whichmust be accepted.9- The main difficulty is the attitude to be adopted towards the Persian Government.      On the principles which boththe Foreign Office and the State Department wish to see appliedto the division of the Persian Gulf, Persia would obtain thenorth-east half of the Gulf up to the median line, which is   &apos;all that she can possibly legitimately claim.     The difficulties with Persia spring exclusively from her ill-founded claim toBahrein,  and apart from this question there is no reason to.suppose that Persia would not accept the solution proposed.As,  however, this claim exists, the Persian Government conobviously not be expected to express concurrence in any arrangements for the orderly division of the continental shelf,of the Persian Gulf,  even if they realise that our proposals,which do not take into account her claim to Bahrein,  arereasonable.      In view of a comparatively recent statement ofthe Persian Prime Minister that he does not intend to raisethe Bahrein issue publicly and would content himself withseeing that Persia&apos;s juridicial position was not impaired, wewould prefer to inform the Persians of the principles which weconsider to be right for the division of the Persian Gulf atroughly the same time as we inform the other riparian states.The alternative would be to confront her with a fait accompliwhich would react unfavourably on the Anglo-American positionin Persia,      The course now proposed would involve a slightlegal risk,  since the Persians might respond by extendingsovereignty over part of the Gulf on the Arab side of the medianline, but they are only likely to do this in respect ofBahrein,  and perhaps Kuwait,  and we can arrange for these Sheikhsto.be moved to assert sovereignty up to the median line, shouldthe &quot;Persians make any move to do this.      The Saudi ArabianGovernment will,  in any case,  have already declared theprinciple which they intend to adopt in dividing the waters of the continental shelf opposite their shores.It must be recc-gnised,  however,, that in the worstpossible circumstances Persia might feel impelled to take usto the United Nations about Bahrein when the issue is broughtto a head by the continental shelf proclamations.      We have discussed this possibility at length with the Americans andwe are assured of their close support.      If it was impossibleto avoid a reference to the United. Nat ions we should try for a reference to the International Court..     The Lav/ Officers haverecently stated that the Persian case for Bahrein has no legalvalidity, but they cannot of course guarantee how theInternational Court may react in any particular set of circumstances.      But the main point is that we cannot avoid the difficulty by refraining from the -action recommended above.-The oil companies are already making enquiries about,concessions in the sea^-bed off the Arab side of the Persian Gulf.
If they ask the Sheikh of Bahrein for a concession, wecannot possibly advise him to refuse on the ground of theunfounded Persian claim, and if he is not to.refuse,  he must first make a proclamation claiming control of a certainarea &quot;of the sea-bed for himself.      The only difference wouldbe that we should then have missed the opportunity of aco-ordinated series of proclamations and would be involvedin an endless series of arguments between the differentriparian states about the extent of their claims.     We should thus have on our hands exactly the some difficulty with the persians and a great many other inter-Arab difficulties asw ell.S. B.Foreign Office,  S.W.1.1st November, 19h8.

/ANNEX  tBtPolicy of the United States with respect of thenatural resources of the subsoil and sea-bed ofthe continental shelfBY THE PRESIDENT OP THE UNITED STATES OP . AMERICA.A PROCLAMATION.WHEREAS the Government of the United States ofAmerica, aware of the long range world-wide need for new sources of petroleum and other minerals,  holds the view thatefforts to discover and make available new supplies of these resources should be encouraged;    andWHEREAS its competent experts are of the opinion thatsuch resources underlie many parts of the continental shelfoff the coasts of the United States of America,  and that with modern technological progress their utilisation is alreadypracticable or will become so at an early date;    andWHEREAS recognised jurisdiction over these resourcesis required in the interest of their conservation and prudentutilisation when and as development is undertaken;    andWHEREAS it is the view of the Government of theUnited States that the exercise of jurisdiction over the natural resources of the subsoil and sea-bed of the continental shelfby the contiguous notion is reasonable and just,  since the effectiveness of measures to utilise or conserve these resources would be contingent upon co-operotion and protection from the shore,  since the continental shelf may be regarded&apos; asan extension of the land-mass of the coastal nation and thusnaturally appurtenant to it, since these resources frequentlyform a seaward extension of a pool or deposit lying within theterritory, and since self-protection compels the coastal nation to keep close watch over activities off its shores which areof the nature necessary for utilisation of these resources;NOW, THEREFORE,  I, HARRY S.  TRUMAN,  President of theUnited States of America, do hereby proclaim the followingpolicy of the United States of America with respect to thenatural resources of the subsoil and sea-bed of the continental shelf.Having concern for the urgency of conserving andprudently utilising- its natural resources,  the.. Government ofthe United States regards the natural resources of the subsoiland sea-bed of the continental shelf beneath the high seas butcontiguous to the coasts of the United States as appertaining tothe United States, subject to its jurisdiction and control.In cases where the continental shelf extends to the shores of another State, or is shared with an adjacent State, the boundaryshall be determined by the United States and the State concernedin accordance with equitable principles.      The character as high seas of the waters above the continental shelf and the rightto their free and unimpeded navigation are in no way thus affected.IN WITNESS WHEREOF,  I have hereunder set my hand and .caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-eighth day ofSeptember,  in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred andforth-five, and of the Independence of the United Statesof America, the one hundred and seventieth.By the President: (Seal) Harry S. TrumanDean Acheson,Acting Secretory of State.
