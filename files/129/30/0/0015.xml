(48) 24522nd October, 1948CABINETSEVENTH SESSION OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCILOF THE UNITED NATIONSNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs 1I circulate for the information of my colleagues a report on the SeventhSession of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations.2.   The United Kingdom Delegation was led by the Minister of State.&apos;   E. B.&apos;;   Foreign Office, :i:,:    i    22nd October, 1948.Copy No.Report on the Seventh Session of the Economic and Social Council, Geneva,19th July to 28th August, 1948The Session opened with three days&apos; acrimonious debate on the Agenda,during which the Council tried vainly to plan for the consideration of some fiftyitems within the time allotted. It decided over Slav protests to adopt a new policyof referring a number of questions direct to committee without prior debate inplenary and, in the hope of avoiding political strife, deferred consideration of several controversial topics such as Trade Union Rights and Forced Labour.Nevertheless, in spite of extending the Session for nine extra days, the council was forced to postpone six items for lack of time and gave only superficialconsideration to several others of real importance. This disappointing record1was partly due to the Slav bloc and partly to the understandable reluctance ofmembers to purge the Agenda of each other&apos;s pet projects with sufficientruthlessness. V      &apos;   12. The Russians intensified the cold war tactics in which they had indulgedat the Sixth Session. Mr. Arutiunian, who led the Soviet Delegation with hisusual ability, announced early on that their chief interest was for items&quot;of significance to the general public&quot; and neglected few opportunities of launching attacks on the Western Powers with little regard to their relevance5to the subjects in hand or their effect on the restive majority. The main Russianpropaganda themes were dollar diplomacy and colonial exploitation, aridconsiderable effort was devoted to opening a rift between &quot; developed&quot; and&quot; under-developed &quot; countries.3. Mr. Malik (Lebanon) was on the whole a disappointing President, apt to go back on his ruling if hammered hard enough by the Slavs and to encouragephilosophic debates on subjects which required no more than business-likehandling. Of the two Vice-Presidents, Mr. Kaminski (Byelorussia) wasoutstanding by reason of his efficiency and sound committee sense.4.   The following are some of the more important features of the Session :  Regional Economic Commissions. The Report of the Economic commission for Europe produced, as had been expected, a violent Slav attack on the MarshallPlan, which was described as a blatant attempt to reduce Western Europe to a36022
state of servile dependence upon the United States. Further Soviet tiradesagainst colonial exploitation followed in the debates on the Economic commission for Latin America and the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East.The Council had no time to examine the recommendations of the Committee set upto consider the establishment of an Economic Commission for the Middle Eastand this item was postponed after little more than token resistance from thef Lebanon and a spokesman from Egypt. The Commonwealth again showedanxiety lest the Regional Commissions should develop into political pressuregroups.5. Refugees. The inevitable Russian attack on the Rreparatpry; Cpm,^mission of the International Refugee Organisation for its subservience to theWestern Powers and its failure to carry out the General Assembly&apos;s mandate to repatriate refugees was as hysterical as usual but not pressed.6. Specialised Agencies. There was little constructive debate on theReports of the Specialised Agencies.,,; I:; The Human Rights Committee. With the intention of speeding up its work, the Council established a special committee to deal with the Report of the human Rights and Status of Women Commissions and to consider the DraftConventions on Freedom of Information and Genocide. It soon became apparent,however, that the Russians intended to use these subjects exclusively for propa-ganda purposes and to hinder by every available method detailed considerationof the Conventions on Freedom of Information. As a result the Draft Declarationof Human Rights, the Draft Convention on Genocide and two of the1 threeConventions on Freedom of Information have gone forward undigested direct tothe General Assembly.8. Co-ordination and Procedure. At the Sixth Session of the Council theUnited Kingdom had been in a minority of one in the view that it was riot theCouncil&apos;s function to examine in detail questions already dealt with at theadministrative level. It was, therefore, satisfactory that at the very outset ofthe Seventh Session several Delegations had come tacitly to agree with this view.When the report of the CounciFs Committee on Co-ordination was taken inPlenary Session, the Canadians and Australians even went so far as to suggestthat a Committee of this kind would be unnecessary in future.- 9. We were successful in persuading the Council to make a more responsibleapproach to the financial implications of the resolutions it adopts. At ourinstance, the appropriate Rule of Procedure was revised and considerablystrengthened. The remaining Rules of Procedure are to be reviewed by an interim Committee sitting before the next session of the Council.General Comments10. Although Geneva proved administratively fairly satisfactory, an unfortunate precedent has been created by the Council&apos;s move to Europe. TheFrench seemed oblivious, when pressing successfully to have the Ninth Sessionagain held in Geneva, both of the substantial extra expenditure that this will entail and of the obvious political motives behind Slav support for any proposalto hold United Nations meetings in Europe.) 11.   The sense of futility and disillusionment produced by the tactics ofthe Russians tended to blind Delegates to the steady and unspectacular work being done in three of the five main committees. As might be expected, there was much talk of radical reform of the Council and its subsidiary bodies. Seriousthought will have to be given to this subject, which will become a practical issueshortly, when a special committee of the Economic and Employment Commissionmeets to consider the future of that body.
