THIS  DOCUMENT  IS   THE PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1948 -        jSECRETCP. (48) 2578th November, 1948CABINETTHE ANGLO-NORWEGIAN FISHERY dispute memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsAFTER consultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland and theMinister for Agriculture and Fisheries, I think my colleagues should be informed of the revival of the dispute over fishing limits claimed by the norwegian government for the exclusive use of Norwegian fishermen. It seems essential,in order to avoid a really embittered controversy, that this question should goto the Court of International Justice and this is likely to be arranged. Moreover,this dispute, apart from its possible effect on our fishing activities on theNorwegian Coast, has assumed much greater importance because of theexaggerated claims to control the fisheries in waters off their coasts recently putforward by the Governments of the United States of America, Mexico, Argentine,Chile, Peru and Iceland. Any concession to Norway may prejudice our position indealing with the claims of these countries.   The circumstances are as follows : 2. On 16th September, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Oslo reported thatthe Norwegian Government had decided to enforce the Royal Decree of 1935prescribing an extensive &quot;Norwegian Fisheries Zone.&quot; This means that large areas of the waters off the Norwegian coast, which, according to the view of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, are high seas and where in consequence all nations havean equal right to fish, will be closed to British trawlers.3. The dispute about fishing limits dates from a long time back. Allattempts to solve, it in the 1920&apos;s were fruitless, but in 1933 a modus vivendi wasagreed with the Norwegian Government on the basis of what has since been known as the Red Line. This line is somewhat outside the strict limits of what we recognise as Norwegian territorial waters and makes a substantial conces-sion to Norway. It is still observed by our trawler owners who have alwaysregarded it as a, temporary expedient pending a decision by the Court of Inter-national Justice. This modus vivendi was upset by the Norwegian decree of 1935.which went far beyond anything that His Majesty&apos;s Government could possiblyaccept.4. Attempts were made in 1938 to conclude a Fishery Convention with the norwegians and to settle the dispute. A draft convention was agreed in Oslobetween British and Norwegian delegations and was referred to the two Govern-ments. This draft convention made further concessions to Norway, but shortly before Norway was invaded it was rejected by the Norwegian Parliament, andthe British trawler owners regarded these concessions as being a breach oftheir conditional acceptance of the Red Line.5. The Norwegian Parliament has now decided that the 1935 decree shouldbe enforced. If British shipping is interfered with on banks outside the RedLine limits which His Majesty&apos;s Government recognised by the modus vivendiof 1933 there are sure to be unpleasant incidents and much bad blood will be created. This would be particularly unfortunate at the present time when weare anxious to draw the Norwegian&apos; and other Scandinavian Governments closer to the Western Powers.6.   His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador was accordingly instructed to express to theNorwegian Minister for Foreign Affairs the surprise and distress of HisMajesty&apos;s Government at the Norwegian decision to apply without warning a36102Copy No.96
measure which is known to be utterly unacceptable to us and to say that unlessenforcement of the 1935 decree was deferred to allow time for consultation rela-tions between the two Governments could not fail to be seriously affected. HisMajesty&apos;s Government were still prepared to try to reach agreement with theNorwegian Government over fishing limits, should the Norwegian government wish to do so; alternatively, the case might be brought before the international court of Justice at The Hague, preferably by agreement between the parties, buteither country could bring it unilaterally since both countries are bound by the optional clase of the statute of the court. In any case it was most desirable thatthere should be an interim arrangement to regulate fishing while the matter wasunder discussion or pending before the court and this could, in the view of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, only be based on the Red Line observed hitherto. HisMajesty&apos;s Government would be glad to discuss these issues with a Norwegiandelegation in London.7. The preliminary reaction of the Norwegian Government to Sir L.Collier&apos;s communication was that a compromise was no longer possible in view ofthe decision of the Norwegian Parliament, and that they saw no difficulty in sending a delegation to London to discuss terms of reference to The Hague Courtif that should be necessary. A final reply is expected shortly. Meanwhile, theNorwegian Government have said that the the status quo will be preserved in the fishing areas.8. To sum up, much the best solution seenis to be that an authoritativeopinion on the relevant issues of international law in this case should be obtainedfrom the Court of International Justice. Owing to the action of the NorwegianParliament, the Norwegian Government is not now in a position to give way onthe claims embodied in the 1935 decree. The only settlement, therefore, whichcould now be negotiated would be a settlement under which the United Kingdomaccepted the Norwegian decree and that would be a step which would be politicallyalmost impossible for the United Kingdom to take in view of the strong reaction of British fishery interests. If there is no settlement by judicial decision or other-wise, incidents by fishery-protection vessels on both sides in the disputed area are inevitable. On the other hand, the Court of International Justice would lay down principles on the application of Avhich the two Governments might be ableto agree and if they did not, they could go back to the court.9. The Legal Adviser of the Foreign Office has discussed the matter withthe Attorney-General, who agrees that in the circumstances a reference of thedispute to The Hague Court appears to be the only practicable course to take.E.
