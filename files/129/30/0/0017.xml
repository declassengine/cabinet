THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1948SECRET CoppMo.    9 J.CP. (48) 247lsfc November, 1948CABINET.ABOLITION OF VISAS FOR UNITED STATES CITIZENSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs. Summary and RecommendationsAT the meeting of the Cabinet on 15th October (CM. (48) 63rd Conclusions,Minute 3) I put forward, orally, a proposal for the unilateral abolition of thevisa requirements for United States citizens visiting the United Kingdom andNorthern Ireland, and was invited to circulate a paper on the subject. I now recommended my colleagues to accept this proposal, both because of the important effect which the abolition of visas for United States citizens would have on ourearnings of dollars from the tourist trade and because of the benefit to Anglo-American relations which would indirectly result. I might add that most ofthe other main tourist countries in Western Europe have already taken the step which I am now proposing.2. The only ground upon which - there could be any public criticism of thisproposal would be that the United Kingdom are unilaterally making a concession,to the United States of America without receiving anything in return. As isexplained below it is impracticable to expect full reciprocity in this matter fromthe United States of America, because of the nature of their immigration problem.To insist on such reciprocity would therefore in effect mean that my proposal could not be implemented. This would run counter to the agreed policy whichI have always advocated of making travel as free and as easy as possible, and i therefore recommend-(1) that my colleagues should accept the proposal set out in paragraph 1;(2) that we should at a later stage endeavour to obtain some measure of reciprocity on the lines of paragraph 5 below.II. General3.   It is the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government (a) to increase dollar earnings by every possible means;(&amp;) to reduce the formalities connected with private travel to a minimum.In conformity with these policies I propose that the visa requirement for holders of United States passport entering the United kingdom should be abolished.III. Previous History4. In pursuit of His Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs policy, agreements have been concluded between the United Kingdom and Belgium, Denmark, France, Iceland,Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland (includingLiechtenstein) for the reciprocal abolition of the visa requirement. I have alreadyonce approached the United States Government with a view to negotiating anagreement between the United Kingdom and the United States of America forthe reciprocal abolition of visas, but they were unable to respond. The UnitedStates Government is faced with an immigration problem of serious dimensionsand, as a result, has in the past enacted legislation by which all visitors to UnitedStates shores are required to obtain a visa. I do not consider that it would be advisable or practicable for the United States Government to repeal or modifythis legislation at the present time.5. Without giving complete reciprocity, there is one concession which theUnited States Government could make in return for the abolition by the UnitedKingdom of the visa requirement for United States citizens. It could abolish the fee, at present $2 (50 cents for the transit visa), which it charges for a visitor&apos;svisa to the United States of America. Indeed, the United States Government hasalready indicated that it would be willing to abolish the visa fee for British36056
subjects resident in the United Kingdom who are bona fide non-immiorants withinthe meaning of the United States immigration laws, and to extend0to two rearsthe validity of such gratis visas. It might be possible by negotiation to improveon this concession, but I would prefer that the abolition of the visa requirement bvus should appear as a spontaneous gesture of goodwill and should not be made conditional on any concessions on their part. I believe that the favourable im-pression created in the United States of America would be much greater if thematter were handled in this way. We could at a later stage endeavour to secureconcessions for United Kingdom visitors to the United States on the above lines.IV.-Security6. The abolition of the visa requirement for holders of United States pass-ports would not result in the admission to the United Kingdom of undesirablesfrom the United States of America. All United States visitors would still bescrutinised by the immigration officers on entering the United Kingdom and if their names appeared on the list of undesirables or there was any other good reason for refusing admission, they would not be allowed to enter the countrv.Y.-The Dollar Aspect7. The Tourist Agencies report that the visa requirement discourages somewould-be travellers from the United States. It is not, apparently, the price ofthe visa (10s.) but the formality of obtaining it and the delay involved, whichacts as a deterrent. It is not, of course, possible to assess the number of UnitedStates tourists who are marginal visitors to the United Kingdom, in the sense that if there had been no visa requirement they would have included the UnitedKingdom in their itinerary. I am, however, advised by those with knowledgeof the American tourist trade that the number is not inconsiderable. Abolitionof the visa if properly publicised would have a positive effect in increasing the flow of tourists.8. Even a small number of additional American visitors to the UnitedKingdom would bring in a valuable additional dollar income. In 1947, 51,266United States visitors came to the United Kingdom and earned us approximately$16,500,000. Up to the end of September, 1948, the number of United Statesvisitors coming to this country has been 65,318 and earnings from them havebeen approximately f 21 million. By the end of 1948, total dollar earnings forthe year from United States citizens alone should be at least $25 million. Byabolishing the visa requirement we should forego the dollar income from thecollection of visa fees, but this is a negligible figure, in comparison with thereceipts referred to above, amounting in 1947 to $83,000.YI.-The European Recovery Programme Aspect9. From the point of view of the European Recovery Programme and,indeed, from the point of view of Anglo-American relations as a whole, it isimportant that as many United States citizens as possible should visit this countryand see for themselves the great productive efforts we are making and the sacrifices we are undergoing in order to achieve recovery. This factor is recog-nised in Article VI of the Economic Co-operation Agreement concluded in Junebetween the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of the UnitedStates of America, which states : &quot; The Government of the United Kingdom will-operate with the Government of the United States in facilitating and encourager-raging the promotion and development of travel by citizens of the United states to and within participating countries.&quot; Furthermore, it is relevant to note that article 8 of the O.E.E.C. convention lays down that &quot; the contracting parties will co-operate in the progressive reduction of obstacles to the free movementof persons.&quot;10. Seven important European tourist countries (Denmark, Luxembourg,the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Italy) have already unilaterallyabolished the visa requirement for United States citizens. There are indications that France intends to do the same. If she does so, the United Kingdom will,apart from Belgium, be the only important European tourist country still main:taining the visa requirement for United States citizens. This would clearly be most undesirable and places the United Kingdom tourist trade at a serious disadvantage. E BForeign Office, S. W. 1,1st November, 1948. .   .
