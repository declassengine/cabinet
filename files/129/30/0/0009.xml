THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1948CONFIDENTIALCP. (48) 23920th October, 1948CABINETPARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE : EFFECT OF LOCAL government act, 1948Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Cabinet should be aware of a change, which, with the approval of thePrune Minister, is to be made in the form of a decision taken by them on22nd July, 1948 (CM. (48) 53rd Conclusions, Minute 5). On that date the cabinet considered a memorandum (CP. (48) 189) which I submitted, after consultationwith the Lord President of the Council, the Minister of Health and the Secretaryof State for Scotland, proposing certain amendments in the private legislationprocedure of the House of Commons, to take account of the effect of the new system of equalisation grants provided for in the Local Government Act, 1948.The Cabinet approved the proposals and authorised their communication to localauthorities. As a result of this decision the local authority associations were communicated with by the Ministry of Health and the Scottish Home Department,and the proposed amendments to Standing Orders were placed upon the OrderBook of the House of Commons on 29th July, 1948, in order to give those con-cerned sufficient time to study them before their introduction at the commencementof the 1948-49 Session.2. Following this publicity, representations have been made to us both bythe House authorities and by certain of the local authority Associations, thatthe form of one of the proposed Standing Orders is open to parliamentary and constitutional objection. I have been in touch with my colleagues regardingthese representations and we have come to the conclusion that there is somesubstance in them and that we should be well advised to change the form ofthe Standing Order in order to meet them.3. It will be recalled that the need for a change in private legislationprocedure arose because, under the existing procedure, a financial resolution inthe House of Commons would be necessary to cover the provisions of any Bill,public or private, which authorises increased expenditure by a local authority andthus potentially increases the amount of its Exchequer grant. The combination of private Bill with financial resolution is so awkward that to insist on this requirement would have had the effect of virtually stopping this type of privatelegislation altogether. We therefore thought it necessary to provide a procedure which would avoid these difficulties, while maintaining the safeguard for theExchequer provided by the requirement of financial resolution. Our original proposal sought to do this by requiring Committees on private Bills to insertin the Bill a protective clause excluding the expenditure authorised by it orany part of it from the calculations upon which equalisation grant is based, ifa report to this effect was made on behalf of the Minister of Health or theSecretary of State for Scotland. The Standing Order which provided for thisis reproduced in paragraph 1 of the appendix to this memorandum.4. The objection brought against this Standing Order is that it gives tothe Government the right to instruct the Committees on private Bills that theyare to insert the protective clause. It is held that this is not only unprecedentedbut also somewhat improper, as amounting to interference with the legislature36009Copy No..31
by the Executive. It is also argued that it is not parallel to the financial resolution procedure, which, while it gives to the Grown the exclusive right to proposecharges upon the public,revenue, retains for Parliament a veto on such proposals;the proposed procedure, it is argued, leaves the initiative in proposing chargesupon the public revenue in the hands of the promoters of private Bills and gives, to the Crown an overriding veto from which the legislature cannot escape.5. It seems to us that there is substance id these objections and they canreadily be met by casting the proposal in a somewhat different form. The effectof the Standing Order which we now propose (paragraph 2 of the appendix tothis memorandum) is that Committees on private Bills should be instructed (not by the Government, but by the Standing Order, i.e., by the House itself) to insertthe protective clause in every Bill that contains provisions which might operateso as to increase the amount of a local authority&apos;s exchequer grant, but that ifa report from the Minister of Health or Secretary of State so recommends, theCommittee may omit the clause. This secures that the initiative in proposingcharges upon the public revenue is retained exclusively for the Government andthat the Government &apos;s proposal to this effect (contained in the report to theCommittee recommending the omission of the protective clause) may be acceptedor rejected by the Committee at their discretion.6. This alternative is, we understand, entirely acceptable to the Houseauthorities, but it gives rise to two difficulties which should be noted. In thefirst place it will mean that, whereas under the former proposal it would benecessary for the Minister of Health or the Secretary of State to make a reporton this point only in the very rare cases where it was desired to exclude a localauthority&apos;s expenditure from being taken into account for equalisation grant,it will now be necessary for a report to be made in the converse cases and these will be the great majority where it is not desired that the expenditure shouldbe excluded. This will mean some additional work for the Departments concerned,but since it is necessary in any case for them to report on almost every Bill ofthis kind, the additional burden will not be very great. The second point of difficulty may have more substance. It is the possible effect of the changed formon local authorities. The correspondence with them has already shown that theydo not find it easy to appreciate that the Government&apos;s power to control the commitments placed on the Exchequer by the private Bills will not be used asan additional means of controlling their activities. Under the former proposal itwas possible to point out that the general rule envisaged by the procedure wasthat expenditure authorised by their private Bills would qualify for exchequer grant. Under the new procedure this appears to be the exception, and although in practice it will be the general rule, it will be more difficult to convince the localauthorities that this is the case. The Minister of Health and the Secretary ofState for Scotland are, however, satisfied that this difficulty can be surmounted,and that it does not in any case outweigh the Parliamentary and constitutionalobjections to the former proposal.7. We have therefore decided to adopt the amended proposal set out inparagraph 2 of the appendix to this memorandum. The Minister of Health andthe Secretary of State for Scotland will communicate its substance to localauthorities, and in due course the revised proposals will be put down on tho&quot;Order Paper of the House of Commons, together with certain other consequentialand minor drafting amendments, Avhich are being made in consultation with theHouse authorities and with which we need not trouble our colleagues.R. S. C.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.20th October, 1948.
