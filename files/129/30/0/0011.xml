(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)\ gjg C R E T COPY NO. 3CP. (48) 24122nd October, 1948.CABINETSITE OP THE PSRi-iAITENT HEADQUARTERS OF THEPOOD AND AGRICULTURE organisation memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and the Ministerof FoodOne question on the agenda of the November sessionof the Council and the Conference of the Pood and agriculture organisation is the site of the Organisations Headquarters.We should welcome the views of our colleagues on theinstructions to be given to the United Kingdom Delegation.2. There are three practicable sites:    Washington, rome and Copenhagen.      The considerations involved in decidingbetween these sites are financial, administrative and political.3. Finance.     P.A.O. will be over-spending its income in the coming year by 400,000 dollars.      Several countries are in default on their subscriptions.      The need for payingsubscriptions in dollars probably contributes to this situation.Members are unlikely to agree t-c raise their subscriptions.On the other hand, a reduction of 400,000 dollars in the costof P.A.0.fs progi^amme of work would cripple the Organisation.4* A European site would be attractive in so far as itmight reduce operating costs and would obviate the need forpaying contributions in dollars.      The Italian Government areprepared to provide at a token cost a large building withample office accommodation.      On the other hand, the instabilityof the lira is a disadvantage.     The Danish Government have offered to provide a building and a large park free, but a largeblock of offices would have to be built.      The cost of removalis an objection to any site in Europe^5* Administrative.      F.A.O.  has gained considerable assistance from its close association with the United StatesDepartment of Agriculture, from the various AmericanUniversities and research bodies, and from the presence in washington of competent and experienced representatives of mostmember-countries.      The upheaval of moving the headquarterswould have an adverse effect on the work of P.A.O. at thiscritical time.6. Politics.      There would be considerable opposition from the United States and Canada to any proposal to move the headquarters out of North America.      There is no doubt thatthe present United States Administration would like to make some such offer as that made by the Italian and DanishGovernments, but they are precluded from giving any undertaking by the Presidential elections and the need for legislation by congress to appropriate funds.      The Latin-American countries
would be likely to support the United States.      On the otherhand, some European countries think that a move to europe would be politically desirable and would reduce what theyconsider excessive American influence in P.A.O.     Owing tothe political instability of Italy, a Scandinavian site is preferable to Rome and would accord well with the policy ofthe widest possible geographical distribution of the headquarters of international organisations,  particularly since the Scandinavian countries have taken an activeinterest in the work of the United Nations.-7* Recommendations.      We conclude that the UnitedKingdom Delegation should seek to secure postponement of adecision until next yeor&apos;s conference. They should do everything possible to obtain the acquiescence of EuropeanDelegations in this temporary solution, and, by pointing tothe balance of financial advantage in favour of a Europeansite, to induce the United States Government to hold out suchhope as they can of accommodation on favourable terms.8. The Foreign Office think that if a postponementcannot be secured, the Delegation should be instructed to actas follows:-&apos;(a) If the United States Government make a more favourablestatement than hitherto, the Delegation should vote for Washington.(b) If they have not made a statement and it appearslikely that the United Kingdom attitude will be decisive in a choice between Washington and a european site, the Delegation should vote forWashington, and should at the same time emphasisetheir hope that the United States Government,having expressed preference for an American site,will make accommodation available on favourablet e rm s.(c) If it is clear that the Conference will only acceptthe European site, the Delegation should vote forCopenhagen rather than Rome.9* In spite of our concern at the risks to thefinancial position of the Organisation,  and therefore to its future effectiveness, especially if the United StatesGovernment does not make a sufficiently generous offer, wewould agree with these conclusions.T.W.J.
