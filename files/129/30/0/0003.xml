THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTTS GOVERNMENT-G*P.(J48)  2^15TH OCTOBER.  iqU8CABINETPETROL RATIONINGMemorandum by the Minister of fuel and PowerPetrol rationing was last considered by the Cabineton the 22nd March (CM. (I48)  24th Conclusions, Minute 9) when Iwas authorised to  adopt the proposals for a standard petrolration put forward in ray paper CP. (I48)  90,  on the   under-standing that the necessary petrol - 120,000 tons a year - wouldbe found from suppressing the Black Market and from, cuts inother allowances.2a The &quot;red petrol&quot; plan has now been operating for four months and I am glad to say that the outcome has been, so far,very satisfactory.     Although it is too early to be quite certainthat the change is permanent,  I am fairly confident that we shallbe able to deal with any fresh attempts at evasion as they occur.3* It is not easy to estimate precisely the savingsachieved, but the figures given in the Appendix suggest that thenet effect of the measures taken to control the Black Market,other economies made and the introduction of the standard rationhas been to reduce deliveries below what they might otherwise have been by about 5,000 tons a week,  i.e. a rate of roughly250,000 tons a year.      This means that enough petrol is beingsaved not only to supply the standard ration in full (120,000tons a year) but also to the extent of a further \ million tonsa year.U. The motoring organisations have not yet seen thesefigures, but they already have a shrewd idea of their -character.When the additional savings are made public,  as they must be when announce the future.rationing arrangements, I shall be pressedvery strongly by these organisations to keep my side of the bargainimplicit in the discussions I had with them in the spring.     Forthey backed our proposals then only on the understanding that if,as they expected,  the savings from suppressing the Black Marketwere greater - and they thought the savings would turn out to be two or three times as much as I did - motorists would benefitaccordingly.      Their support was most useful in dealing with thevery many bitter criticisms provoked by the deduction of thestandard allowance from supplementary allowances.      I am afraid that unless we keep our side of the bargain they will accuse usopenly of breach of faith, withdraw their support and go intoviolent opposition again.      This would lead to unfavourablepolitical and administrative consequences and would seriouslyjeopardise the success of the &quot;red petrol&quot; plan.The circulation  of this paper has  been  strictly limited. *It is issued for the personal use top SECRET Copy No. ^ ^
5- If the additional petrol saved by suppressing the black market is&apos;given back to the private motorist, there will, ofcourse,, be an&apos; increase in dollar expenditure onpetrol for civilian consumption above the current rate, but it will, not bring this expenditure above the level expected when the standardration was approved last spring.      I must also make it clearthat, had&apos;I realised at the outset that the savings would turnout to be so much greater, I should certainly not have proposedthat the standard ration should be as low as 90 miles a month and restricted only to those receiving.-no supplementary,allowances,&apos;     I cannot,  therefore, make shortage of dollars an excuse for breaking faith with the motoring organisations.6. Since last spring,  however,  the international situation has changed and we no?/ face much heavier demands for petrol bythe Services.      In particular,  their stock building programmescall for 886,000 tons of motor spirit and 711,000 tons of aviation spirit during 19b9 over and above the estimates whichwe had before   us in April this year.      If no extra petrol weregiven to the private motorist, the additional savings fromsuppressing the Black Market would contribute, during theperiod June, 19U8 - December, 19*49,  a total of no less thanU00,000 tons towards this stock building programme.7* If,  on the other hand,  it is decided  that the savingshould be given to motorists, there seem to me to be two mainalternatives:-(A) To leave the standard ration unchanged but stopdeducting it from supplementary allowances sothat those drawing these allowances get 90 milesextra motoring a month.(B) To increase the standard ration from 90 to 150miles a month raid not deduct the addition fromsupplementary allowances so that, in effect, allmotorists get an extra 60 miles motoring a month.8.  . Proposal (A)  has the- advantage that it would get rid of a tiresome complication in the present system of petrol rationing which has given rise to very severe criticism from-the motoring public and will remain a constant source of troubleas long as it continues. .    The deductions are    particularlytrouble some where people use their cars for voluntary public workfor which they were in receipt of &apos;small supplementary allowances.Moreover, I have been able to justify deducting the standardration from supplementary allowances only on the ground that the saving from suppressing the Black Market and the other measures would .not be more than 120,000 tons, and, that v/e could not.therefore afford to give extra petrol to those who were alreadygetting as much,  or more than,  the standard ration.      Thatargument would, of course, no longer be appropriate.9* For administrative reasons a decision to stop the systemof deducting the standard ration from supplementary allowancescould not take effect completely for. six months,  i.e. if v/e stopit from 1st December,, it will not come fully into effect until 1st June.      If we postpone a decision now,  the.deduction of thestandard ration from supplementary allowances is bound tocontinue into next- summer.     As a result of this administrativedifficulty the extra petrol consumption this winter would be negligible,- only some b0,0Q0 tons between now and the end ofMay,  19*4 9.     Thereafter, -the cost would be 230,000 tons per annum,which would approximately absorb the estimated  savings.     Even so,
the suppression of the Black Market would still have contributed210,000 tons of petrol towards the stock building programmebesides paying for the standard ration.10. Proposal (B) would absorb the whole of the savings fromthe date from which it took effect.     Although from some points ofview it is an attractive one, particularly as it would give allmotorists the same increase, I do not myself recommend it ihpresent circumstances.      To increase the standard ration nowmight give rise to criticism from the Organisation for european economic Co-operation and possibly from the United States, andthe feet that we undoubtedly have.had a more severe rationing system than almost any other country would probably not beregarded as an adequate reply.11. - At the same time I must add  that I have obtained advice from the Russell Vick Committee  (in the strictest confidence)end that the Committee recommend that,  if extra petrol is available,   this should be distributed by a combination of (A)with (B) under which -(i)    the standard ration would be immediately increasedto 120 miles a month from the present level of90 miles a month;    and(ii)    only one half of this standard ration, namely 60miles a month, would be deducted from the supplementary allowance (instead of the presentdeduction of 90 miles).While this proposal would have the advantage    of providing some improvement for all motorists, it would be open,n though to a smaller extent,   to  the objections to proposal (B) -mentioned inparagraph 10;    and we should not get rid of the administrativecomplications inherent in making deductions from the supplementary allowances.conclusion the four courses to which 1 have referred in this paper are -(i)    To use all the additional savings for defence and, inparticular, for increasing military stocks.      If we-do this we shall be charged with breaking faith andrisk losing the support of the motoring organisations.Only,  I think,  if the international position was very grave indeed and the decision was presented as part ofa general defence plan,  could we avoid theseconsequences.(ii)    To adopt piroposal (A),  i.e.  to stop deducting the standardration from supplementary allowances.(iii) To adopt proposal (B), i.s. to increase the standardration by 60 miles a month - the increase not to be deducted from supplementary allowances.Civ.)    To adopt the proposal of the Russell Vick Gommi ttee - toincrease the standard ration by 30 miles a month,  and .todeduct half the new ration of 120 miles a month from the supplementary allowances.For the reasons given I favour (ii)H.G.Ministry of Fuel and Power;,  S.W.I.,15 th .0c tober , 19h8.
APPENDIXNet effect on motor1 spirit consumption of theintroduction of the, standard ration measuresto control the Black Market and other economies .It is not easy to estimate the effect of these changes on motor spirit consumption &quot;because it is not possibleto say with certainty what consumption would have been if the changes had not been mode.A broad impression may, however, be obtained by comparing motor, spirit deliveries in the last six months withdeliveries in the comparable months of 191+7.    Thusi -Deliveries into consumption of motor Spirit &apos;Average weekly deliveries in thousands of tons10 weeks ended20th May        June   July     August  -       September1947 91.0 97-4   10k.1     98.6 103.41948 .  83.3 82.3     91.4     87-1 91.0(provisional)1948compared   -   7.7       : - 14.6 - 12.7 - 11.5 - 12.4with1947It will he seen that deliveries in the ten weeks before the introduction of the standard ration and the measuresto suppress the black market averaged 7,700 tons a week lessthan in the comparable weeks of 1947.    In the following months,however, this difference was increased to from 11,500 to14,600 tons, i.c. there was a jump in the rate of saving afterthese measures wore introduced of betwoon 3,800 and 6,900 tonsa week - on average saving of 5,000 tons a-week which is equivalent to an annual rate of saving of about 250,000 tons ayear.
