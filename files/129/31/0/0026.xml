V150US DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT)( SECRETCP. (48) 2967TH DECEMBER,  1948CABINETRATES OP PAYr  PENSIONS AND GRATUITIESFOR THE PERMANENT WOMEN1S forces memorandum &quot;by the Chancellor of the exchequer. In his paper (c.P.(4S) 295 dated 7th December) the Ministerof Defence has proposed that the pay of officers and other ranks of the women&apos;s Services should be increased to four-fifths ofthe present rates for the menfs Forces.    At present members ofthe women&apos;s Services are paid at the war-time rates (which were two-thirds of the war-time rates for men) provisionally increasedby 8d a day for other ranks and ls.Od. a day for officers.    Since1946 the rates of pay of the men&apos;s Forces have be on substantially increased and the actual ratio of women&apos;s to men&apos;s pay at present is generally well below two-thirds.    The Minister proposes alsothat the pensions and gratuities on discharge to be provided infuture for officers and other ranks of the permanent women&apos;services should be at four-fifths the corresponding rates for men.2. The Minister^&apos;s proposals are based principally on theview that officers and other ranks of the women&apos;s Services will do the same work as men and will have the same responsibilitiesas men. I am not convinced of the correctness of this view.Further, a four-fifths ratio would produce rates which would be excessive. To my mind the Minister&apos;s proposals are open to thefollowing objections;-Rates of Pa:/(i)    Although a large proportion of the work done by women in the post-war Forces would otherwise have to be done by men,the exemption of women from the use of personal lethal weaponsmarks an essential difference between them.   For this reason the Royal Commission on Equal pay, while recognising that therewas a substantial margin of overlap between men&apos;s and women&apos;sduties,  took the view that Service women could not be regardedas employed in the same conditions as men.    (See paragraphs 57to 6l of the Report of the Royal Commission, a copy of which isshewn in Appendix II).    The distinction between men and women in the Forces is clearest in the Navy, where v^oraen never under-take sea servicej    it is least apparent in the ground branchesof the R.A.F., where there is a high proportion of jobs behindf the fighting line giving considerable scope for substitution ofwomen for men.   But even where women directly, replace men it isin general in the lighter end of the man&apos;s job.    It is true that many men in the Forces are employed on non-combatant duties butare paid the same rates as combatant troopsc    It can, however,reasonably be argued that men&apos;s rates are fixed, by reference tothe position of the combatant majority and that women should get lower rates which take account of their lower liabilities.COPY NO.  O-1
(ii)    In view of women&apos;s exemption from combatant liabilitytheir responsibilities in the higher ranks do not increase to thesome extent with each rise in rank as those of members of the men&apos;forces.(iii)    If a four-fifths ratio is adopted now it would be tantamount to accepting, that members of the women&apos;s Services dothe same work as men.    This-would make it impossible when theGovernment decide to implement &quot;equal pay for women&quot; to avoidincreasing the pay of the women&apos;s Services to full men&apos;s rates.In my view this would be indefensible and the public would stronglyobject to it.(iv)    The grant of a four-fifths pay ratio would result inexceptionally large increases over the war-time rates, particularly for N.COs and officers.    Other ranks would get increases ranging from 12s.l0d* to&apos;33s.0d. a week.   For officers the increases would&apos;range from  hi per annum for a Subaltern to  397 per annum for a woman Colonel.   Even compared with the rates at present in issue (as provisionally increased in 19^-6)  a four-fifths ratiowould give increases ranging from 8s.2d. to 29s.2d. a week forother ranks and from  29 a year for a Subaltern to  379 a year for a woman Colonel.    It would not be possible to reconcile such increases with the Government&apos;s wage stabilisation policy.(v)    For officers the rates so produced would, particularlyin the more senior ranks, be very considerably higher than thoseof nurses employed, in the Armed Forces.    These nurses, unlikemost officers of the women&apos;s Services,  have a professionalqualification.    They rank as officers and are paid the NationalRushcliffe scales for hospital nurses.    To raise the rates of remuneration for officers of the women&apos;s Services very substantially above those for nurses would invite demands for corresponding increases for nurses both in the Services and in civil hospitals.3. The Minister of Defence cites the war-time employmentof women in anti-aircraft batteries, Fighter Command OperationsRooms etc., as showing that members of the women&apos;s Services willbe accepting the full responsibilities of men of the armed forces.   He does not dissent from the view that Commanders ofthe men&apos;s Forces carry a heavy responsibility for the lives oftheir men under active operations, but he claims that under present conditions this is a purely contingent liability.    Heargues that the control of establishments can be exercised toensure that the responsibilities carried by officers of thewomen&apos;s Services are equal to those of corresponding ranks ofthe men&apos;s Forces.k. I do not accept these arguments as invalidating the strong objections set out above to the payment of members of thewomen&apos;s Services at four-fifths the corresponding men&apos;s rates.The employment of women in war-time on various minor aspects of active operations still leaves the essential difference betweenmen and women arising from the exemption of women from actualfighting and the use of personal lethal weapons.   Moreover,the operational responsibilities of officers of the men&apos;s forces are not confined to periods of active operations in a major war.In the present unsettled wo.rid conditions the men&apos;s Forces may becalled on at any time - as in Palestine - to undertake active orsemi-active operations.    No reasonable increase in the number ofwomen under the charge of, say, a woman Colonel could be regardedas balancing the very heavy responsibilities which fall on anArmy Colonel for the lives of his men when engaged on semi-active operations,  e.g. in Malaya at the present time.&quot;
5. Certain of the above, objections would be substantiallyovercome by the adoption of a two-thirds instead of a four-fifthsratio.   For instance the risk of demands for the payment of fullmen&apos;s rates, when &quot;equal pay for women&quot; is implemented, wouldhe much reduced,. especially if it were stated no?/ that theGovernment do not accept that the women&apos;s Services carry the fullresponsibilities of the men&apos;s. Forces.   For other ranks a two-thirds ratio would give increases over the present interim(provisionally increased) rates ranging from 2s.i-f.do a week for anA*C*W.l. to lLj.s.Od. a week for Sergeants and above.    A two-thirds ratio-fop officers, however, while providing no increase -and in some cases small decreases - compared with the presentinterim rates for Subalterns would still give excessiveincreases (approximately 605-0 of present rates) for the more seniorranks.    For instance a woman lieutenant Colonel would get an&apos;immediate increase of  162 a year, while a woman Colonel would get an immediate increase of  221 a year.    The excessiveincreases for the senior officer ranks, moreover, besides being-inconsistent with the Government1s stabilisation policy wouldinvolve reactions on the nursing Services.    It would not bepossible to meet these objections by adopting some otherhigher or lower ratio than two-thirds,  i.c.  if the rates soproduced were adequate for the lowest ranks they would be excessive for the senior ranks.6. In view of the above objections to the adoption of anyfixed ratio of men&apos;s rates for the women&apos;s Services I originallysuggested the provision of a special scale of pay for women not specifically related to the rates for men.    in this scheme therates for the basic rank (a Private) would be approximately the same as those proposed by the Minister of Defence,  ie.   four-fifths men&apos;s rates.    This ratio would toper with each successiveincrease in the rank, including officer ranks,  to take accountof the smaller increase in responsibility than in the men&apos;forces.7* It has boon strongly represented to me, however,  thatany departure from the war-time principle of a fixed ratio v/ould be much resented by women and would have a bad effect on recruiting.    If the cabinet agree with this view, while I stillconsider that my original suggestion for a special scale v/ould be the most logical solution,  I do not wish to press it.    If,however,  the women&apos;s rates are fixed at a proportion of men&apos;rates I feel strongly that a lower ratio than four-fifths shouldbe adopted, preferably not more than two-thirds men&apos;s rates./Tables showing spociracn rates on the various basesarc given in Appendix 1 JjPensions and Gratuities8. I agree with the Minister of Defence that the rates ofpensions and gratuities on termination of service to be providedfor officers and ether ranks of the women&apos;s Services shouldgenerally speaking follow whatever decision is taken on their rates of pay.    I consider, however,  that should it be decided thatthe rates of pay of the women&apos;s Services should be at four-fifthsmen&apos;s rates a lower ratio should be adopted for retired pay and gratuities of officers.    The present rates of retired pay of the men&apos;s Forces have been fixed in the knowledge that officersretired in middle life will generally have substantial familycommitments, and I consider that the payment of four-fifths ofthese rates to women officers would be excessive.    It is true,as the Minister of Defence says, that there is no particularelement in the retired pay of an officer of the men&apos;s Forces Whichcan be regarded as given specifically to meet family respon-sibilities.    The rates of officers retired pay,  however,  con be
regarded as the retired counterpart of the male officers pay andmarriage allowance.   Women officers while serving on the ActiveList will not receive marriage allowance, and this should, hereflected in their rates of retired, pay.   As regards gratuities,on career considerations the rates for women officers havehitherto been one half the corresponding rates for the men&apos;forces and I see no adequate reason lor increasing this ratio.For these reasons I ash the Cabinet to agree either that:-(i)    the pay of the women&apos;s Forces should, he on a specialscale on the basis that they are employed on women&apos;work and. do not accept the full responsibilities of the Armed Forces *or (if it is decided that the pay of the women&apos;s Forces shouldbe at a fixed proportion of the pay of the men&apos;a Forces)(ii)    that the ratio should not exceed two-thirds themen&apos;s rates.(iii)    If the Cabinet decide that the pay of the women&apos;forces should be at four-fifths the rates forcorresponding ranks of the men&apos;s Forces I ask that a. lower ratio should apply to pensions and.gratuities.P..S .C.T r easury C hamb er s, s .W. 1. ?7th December j 19h-8*

APPENDIX IIEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF ROYAL COMMISSIONON EQUAL PAY57.    The members of the Woman&apos;s Royal Naval Service, the auxiliary Territorial Service and the Women1 s Auxiliary AirForce numbered 447,000 in Jane, 1944, or abouijfe 10 per cent,of trie number of men.     The number had fallen to 147,000 atthe end of May, 1946, .or about 7 per cent,  of the number ofmen on the same date, and is expected to be about 68,000 at theend of 1946, or just over 61 per cent,  of the number of men^58.    The salient fact,  from our point of view, about theemployment of women in the armed forces is that, as a matter ofpolicy, the actual use of lethal weapons forms no part of their duties.      It is true that this distinction between them and themen becomes a very fine one in the cases of A.T.S. personnelserving in anti-aircraft batteries, in some instances even withthe responsibility for the actual operational direction of thebattery, and W.A.A.F. balloon operators whose duties included the attachment of an explosive charge to the balloon cables;but in any event such cases are exceptional.      It is more opento question how much reality there is in the contingent liability for combatant duties of large numbers of men the essence of whose employment Is of a quite different nature.     None the less,in characterising the respective men&apos;s and women&apos;s serviceseach viewed as a whole,  it must be accepted that the men&apos;services are predominantly combatant services whereas thewomen&apos;s services are employed on non-combatant duties.59.    It follows that from one point of view there is no overlapwhatever of male and female employment in the field nov\r underconsideration in that women cannot strictly be regarded asemployed in the same conditions as men.      From another pointof view, however, which ignores merely contingent liabilities,it is equally clear that the overlap is appreciable, thoughits extent is ill defined.      The paragraphs followingillustrate the difficulties of defining it*.60.    In our enquiries of the service departments one questionwe put was the following:    Where men and women are engaged on what is broadly the same work what difference,  if any, is therein the establishment allowed according as men or women areemployed?     Do women replace men on a &apos;one-one&apos;  basis or insome different proportion?     Fran the replies we received itappears that almost exactly one half of the A.T.S.  substitute for men on the &apos;one-one&apos; basis and that, with the exception ofthe ship&apos;s cook branch,.all W.R.N.S.  do so, the position in theW.A.A.F. being, we gather, somewhere between these two.      Itmight be thought that in these &apos;one-one&apos;  cases at least it  .could be assumed that the employments constitute an overlaparea.     But the assumption is unsafe.      It is clear that the occupational descriptions are wide enough, at least in a numberof cases, to permit of a variety of what are really,  though notnominally, different jobs to be, so to say 1 carved out&apos;  of them;and it is possible that women in fact perform only sane of thesejobs while men are capable of performing them all.      Such a situation need not reflect Itself in the &apos; substitution-ratio&apos;;*In considering the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services we have had beforeus memoranda supplied by the three Service Departments inaddition to the evidence of the Treasury in Part C of appendix I to&apos; the minutes of evidence.
its demands could be met by limiting, whether by explicit rule,or, tacitly, in practice, the proportion of women in theestablishment as a whole.      But that it can exist is shown by those cases, in the W.A.A.F.  - electricians, fitters, flightmechanics and instrument repairers - where the substitutionratio&apos;.is affected in an interesting way.      In these cases thebasis of substitution varies with the percentage of airwomen toairmen as follows, - up to 25 per cent,  the ratio is 1 : 1,from 25 per cent,   to 50 per cent,  it is 1.1 : 1, from 50 percent,  to 75 per cent,  it is 1.2 : Ij    and we were informed thatairwomen are normally employed only to the extent of 25 percent,  in these trades as it has been found that this providesstlf ficient work of a character which can be performed by them without physical difficulty.     Similarly, in the case of theW.R.N.S.  where, with the one exception already noted, women are invariably employed on the basis of a head for headreplacement, we were expressly warned that this cannot betaken as evidence that in ail cases the work performed by thetwo sexes is the same, a main reason being; that the womanrating is utilised for a lesser range of jobs.      We cannotattempt to determine what part of the field of one-onesubstitution in each of the services consists in work that isgenuinely the same&apos; for both sexes, though it undoubtedly existsand is of appreciable dimensions.      Thus, in the A.T.S., it certainly includes the clerical employments, which account for27 per cent,  of the whole strength of the A.T.S., but it cannotbe stated with assurance what more it covers.61.    In the previous paragraph we have explained why theexistence of a 1 :  1 replacement ratio a.s between the sexescannot be taken as proof positive that the work theyrespectively perform is the same in kind.      We have now topoint out, what is perhaps more obvious, that the operation ofa different ratio in any occupation does not establish thatthe work undertaken differs in kind.      It may of course do so,because it may reflect a narrower specialisation on the part ofthe women;   but it is equally possible that it should reflectonly lesser capacity over the same range of duties as isprescribed for the. men.      In any case, whatever the area of genuine overlap may be, and whatever the nature ans scale ofthe differences in the work of the two sexes, the system of remuneration actually in force completely ignores suchvariations and treats all the women alike as regards the ratiobetween their reward and that of the men;    nor is it easy to see how on practical grounds such a course could be avoided.
