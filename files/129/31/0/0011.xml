I also circulate copies of telegrams No. 477 and503&apos;containing earlier messages from Mr.  Gordon-Walker andNo. 490 from Mr.  McNeil.      I understand that a reply has beensent to Mr.  McNeil&apos;s message rejecting Sir Oliver Goonetilleke&apos;snew appeal.2. I feel that the attention of my colleagues should bedrawn to the considerations set out in Mr.  Gordon-Walker&apos;telegram.3* While I fully appreciate the reasons for refusing toenter into an arrangement whereby We should support the admission of Russian satellites in order to secure the with-drawal of the Russian veto on Ceylon,  I feel that my colleagues should be aware of the possible reactions to this policy, notonly in relation to Ceylonfs position in the Commonwealth butalso from the point of view of the risk to our defence bases in Ceylon.4&quot; I do not myself see how we can alter our previouspolicy of refusing a &quot;deal&quot; with the U. S.S. R.  as regards OuterMongolia;    indeed, the recent decision of the international court of Justice makes it, in my view,  impossible to changeour line.      I feel, however, that my colleagues should in thecircumstances have an opportunity of considering the matter;and in any case we shall be on stronger ground with Ceylon ifwe can say that the Cabinet have considered the matter again,and come to the same decision.P.

f91[This telegram is of particular secrecy and should be &apos;retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on]Cypher/OTP P R I S E Cj -FROM UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY PARIS(U.K. DELEGATION) TO FOREIGN OFFICE -No. 521 D. 2.42 p.m. 24th November, 194824th November, 1948&apos;    R. 1.45 p.m. 24th November, 1948MOST IMMEDIATETOP SECRETPlease pass following to Commonwealth relations office most immediate personal for Machtig fromGordon-Walker.With great respect and after anxious consideration would like to express my doubt whether all aspects ofthe problem of Ceylon&apos;s admission to United Nations havebeen given due consideration.2.     I have grave fears about the effect of a failure to get Ceylon into United Nations upon herstatus within the Commonwealth.     I expressed that fearlong ago in the report I made on my return from Ceylonafter the independence celebrations.     There was alwaysa general danger that the present government of Ceylonmight come under heavy pressure if Ceylon did not receivethe International hallmark of independence.Bandaranaike, who is a member of the government, maywell be tempted to lead a breakaway in this Issue, inorder to make, a bid for the Prime Ministership.3.     This general danger has been diminished in onerespect, owing to the internal troubles of Burma;     Burmais now a less persuasive example of the advantage of leaving the- Commonwealth:   but it remains true thatBurma having left the Commonwealth, at once got intoUnited Nations.      -4.     The general danger has been increased in two ways:   first, I am pretty sure that in spite of all thatMcNeil and I have said, Goonetilleke feels that Ceylonis being made into a pawn in the cold war.&apos;    He may evenhave the opinion that the United States (and perhap seven we) are rather glad to have one more good case touse in argument against the Slavs.     I do not think this opinion can be shaken by mere assertions on our part.Secondly, there/
TOP SECRETU.N.G.A.. Paris (U.K.Delegation) telegram No. 521 to   -Fore ign Office-- ^ 2 ^Secondly, there are the arrangements arrived at withEire.    The present Government of Ceylon is willingindeed eager, to remain a normal old-fashionedDominion, recognising the Crown etc.     It may now come under very heavy pressure to adapt itself to the eire status.     Some members of the government mayjoin with the opposition in this matter.    This mightnot get Ceylon into United Nations hut she might hetempted to try it, especially if the pressure to getright out of the Commonwealth becomes heavy.5.     If anything of this sort happened, our defence interests may be jeopardised.     We could nothave the defence arrangements now proposed if Ceylonbecame like Eire.6,    The present Government of Ceylon will donone of these things and will preserve the presentrelationship as long as it can.    They will notblackmail us.     But the opposition to the governmentwill increase, the government will somewhat lose heart,and it may he split.     Should Senanyake he removed fromthe scene by death or illness, the situation would heseriously changed for the worse.7.     All this boils down of course, to the proposition that we should seriously attempt a generalagreement with Russia about new admissions.     I fullyunderstand all the arguments against this and realisetheir weight.     Are the arguments on the other sidefully appreciated?     If there is any chance at allthat we shall change our mind on this matter next year or the year after, I urge that we think again now.To hold out now and then to change when all.the damage has.been done would indeed be to have the worst of twoworlds.     Our relationship with Ceylon needs time andcultivation to grow into full blossom.     If it issubjected too soon to too severe a frost it may wither.8,     I have shown this to McNeil who asks me to .add that he does not agree with me.     He does not thinka proposal to admit Mongolia would get through theAssembly.    It would in his view in any case be vetoedby China.[Advance copy sent to Sir E.

R.O.[Begins]. .Goonetilleke has nov/ given up all hope of everseeing the Russians.     He has received a letter in Russianwhich merely gives him an address to which information about Ceylon can be sent.2.     I am somewhat surprised that Russia did not take this opportunity to try and woo and weaken Ceylon.     But itsnows that Russia has made up her mind.     It is something that we did not try to stop Goonetilleke approaching the Russians. &apos;3.     Sir Oliver has drawn two conclusions(a) he wants us now to go all out in speeches etcabout Ceylon&apos;s independence.     He wants as much as possible of this cabled out by the agencies and other means to ceylon.     Please ask Joyce to note this and make arrangements.     I expect to be making a speech in aday or so.(b) His only hope is a general horse-trade which would let in all outstanding applicants.    You will have seen the line from the Minister of State&apos;s telegram to ForeignOffice of 22nd November United Nations General AssemblyNo. 4-90   about their interview.     Goonetilleke has keptquiet about this with me except for an occasional phrase.[End s ] ,[Copies sent to C.R.0. for Sir E-Mashtig and Mr. Joyce].V V v

FROM UNITED -NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY PARIS  (U. K.DELEGATION) TO FOREIGN office no.  49022nd November, 1948immediateSECRETNew admissions.Following from Minister of State.Sir Oliver Goonetillelce came to see me in greatdistress.      He went over the ground with which you arevery familiar saying that he had had a firm undertaking from the- Secretary of State that we would take any stepto secure Ceylon&apos;s admission.      He once more quoted the alleged conversation which purports that the Secretary ofState said that he would even be prepared to support the admission of Outer Mongolia and Albania to secure Ceylon&apos;sentrance.    He has asked the Soviet Delegation to see him andhas been round some Slav Delegations5 including the Czecho-slovakian, and he says that he was told by each of them that soviet Russia knows that if she agrees to the admission of ceylon without that of Outer ,Mongolia she will never againhave any chance of getting Outer Mongolia even considered.2.      I replied, with the arguments with which you are familiar and put to him an additional one,, that even if weswallowed our previous statements we could not guarantee that Outer Mongolia would secure a majority vote in theAssembly.3.      However,  in view of his earnest pleas and hisinsistence that if they were turned down it would mean  -defeat of his Government and the eventual withdrawal of ceylon from the Commonwealth;,  I agreed to re-submit his case to you.
