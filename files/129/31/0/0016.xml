Viscount Jowitt, Lord Chancellor.The Right. Hon. P. J. Noel-Baker, M.P., Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations.Sir Norman Brook, Cabinet Office.Sir Gilbert Laithwaite, Commonwealth Relations Office.Mr. Stephen Holmes, Board of Trade.Hon. F. E.

A. Beasley, High Commissioner for Australia inLondon.New Zealand   ,The Right Hon. Peter Fraser, Prime Minister of New Zealand.Mr. A. D. Mclntosh, Secretary for External Affairs.LORD JOWITT briefly reviewed the situation leading up to the receipt ofPandit Nehru&apos;s Ten Points (which in their final form had not been received byHis Majesty&apos;s Government until 28th October) and the Opinion recorded on themby the Law Officers. It had not been possible to discuss the Indian problemduring the Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting, since no positive propositions were ripe for discussion until after the Meeting was over. It now seemed clear, both from the statements he had made in London and from his Ten Points, thatPandit Nehru wished India to remain in the Commonwealth if an acceptablebasis could be found, and was trying to find an acceptable basis. The Indianattitude was thus in contrast to that of the Eire Government, who were anxiousto cease to be members of the Commonwealth. Ministers had now to consider what course they should follow in the light of the Law Officers&apos; Opinion, whichsuggested that the Ten Points did not represent an adequate basis either forIndia&apos;s remaining a member of the Commonwealth or for defending the con-tinued extension to her of most-favoured-nation treatment after she had ceased to belong to it. United Kingdom Ministers would greatly welcome the advice of the Commonwealth representatives in Paris.2. Dr. EVATT emphasised that the Commonwealth Governments were alldirectly and vitally concerned with the settlement of the Indian problem. Buthe and his colleagues in Paris had received the Ten Points only in the last fewdays. It was unfortunate that it had not been possible to discuss this issue duringthe recent Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting.He had studied the Ten Points and agreed that they would not be a satisfied ac-tory basis for India&apos;s continued membership of the Commonwealth. Moreover, hewas surprised to find that they represented a position entirely different from thatwhich he had understood Pandit Nehru to be ready to accept when he andMr. Beasley had discussed the matter with him on 13th October. The plan whichPandit Nehru had then in mind was one under which there would be an IndianRepublic with a President, who would be the final authority for all the internal affairs of the Republic. In the external field, however, he would be the represen-tative of the Crown for matters such as the signing of Heads of States&apos; Treaties,the accrediting of Ambassadors, &amp;c, and in this way an external association36218 B
would be retained with the Commonwealth. As a result there would be m india as a reality the position that had nominally existed in the case of Eire under the eire External Relations Act. He had told Pandit Nehru that in his view suchan arrangement would provide a sufficient basis for India&apos;s continued membership of the Commonwealth. But this proposition seemed entirely to have disappearedfrom the Ten Points, and he was at a loss to understand how this new situation^could have arisen.3 As for the Ten Points themselves, he felt that apart from the link bycitizenship (Point 3), they had little substance. They provided no real functionfor The King except in respect of honours (Point 5), and the suggestion theremade that The King should be the &quot; First Citizen of the Commonwealth &quot; was quite unacceptable. The Head of the Commonwealth could not be its first citizen.Point 8 seemed to him to be dangerous, if it meant that in India the President,and not the Australian High Commissioner, would look after Australians. Ifcitizenship on the lines of Point 3 were to be the only effective link, the possiblereaction oh the position of Eire must be borne in mind. The factual associationswith India were less close than with Eire. But if, as seemed to be the case, India,unlike Eire, wished to continue to be regarded as a member of the Commonwealth,that gave a basis on which to build.4. Mr. FRASER said that Pandit Nehru had been less definite in state-ments made to him about 15th October than he appeared to have been withdraw. Evatt.5. Mr. ROBERTSON was not aware of the precise communication thatPandit Nehru had made to Mr. Mackenzie King, but LORD JOWITT said thathe understood that Mr. Mackenzie King had thought, after his conversations with Pandit Nehru, that it would be unwise to tie ourselves necessarily to amonarchical form of Government for India, and that if possible we should try to keep India within the Commonwealth, even if no link with the Crown couldbe secured.6. Mr. NOEL-BAKER said that he understood that there had been con-versations between Mr. MacBride and Pandit Nehru and that Pandit Nehru had agreed that because of her history and because her people wished to be separated from the Commonwealth, Eire was on a quite different footing from India.7. Sir B. N. Rau, when he had seen him in August, had taken the line thatthe Indian constitution would deal only with internal matters and would not affectexternal relations. He had derived the clear impression that Sir B. N. Rau had at that time in mind the continuance of a link with the Crown in respect of external relations. He had always thought it most desirable to secure Indianagreement to The King&apos;s continuing to sign the credentials of Ambassadors andHeads of States&apos; Treaties, and he had a strong impression that at one timePandit Nehru had been ready to go as far as this. He agreed that there had beena change in the Indian attitude. As regards citizenship as a positive link, it hadto be remembered that none of us had an absolute right of entry into the immigra-tion countries of the Commonwealth. Need we, however, be too negative fromthe start on the content of citizenship ? Nations into which there was a sub-stantial flow of immigration must clearly have the right to control entry, but animmigrant, once he had entered, had rights throughout the Commonwealth, saveonly in South Africa, where those rights would presumably be withheld fromIndians. Need that single exception destroy the value of citizenship as acriterion and a link 18. Dr. EVATT also stressed this point. Immigration laws stood in a classapart, for no nation gave the right of entry outside the metropolitan area. A linkby a series of reciprocal agreements all round the Commonwealth on the basis that Eire now seemed to have in mind might be built up into somethingsubstantial. 09.   In further discussion it was pointed out that, so long as there had beena common King and a common allegiance, no difficulty had arisen in assigningsome content to the conception of Commonwealth citizenship.     The difficulty would arise when the citizens of some Commonwealth countries ceased to owe 3that allegiance.There was general agreement among Commonwealth representatives that itwas of the greatest importance to secure an acceptance by India of some sub-stantial link with the Crown.   Commonwealth Governments would find great
difficulty in justifying to their Parliaments and publics any agreement to dispense with that link.10. Dr. EVATT suggested, and the meeting generally agreed, that everyeffort should be made to persuade Pandit Nehru to agree that the President shouldbe The King&apos;s representative for signing Heads of States&apos; Treaties and the? credentials of Ambassadors.   This could be done outside the written constitution.&quot;&quot;If an arrangement of this nature could be secured, it would greatly strengthen our position internationally in maintaining that India remained a member ofthe Commonwealth, and in defending the extension to her of most-favoured-nation treatment. If efforts in this sense failed, it might be necessary to try to workout a more elaborate arrangement in respect of citizenship in the hope that thatmight fill the gap. But he suggested that immediate steps should be taken tomake contact with Sir G. S. Bajpai, who was in Paris, and to send a message toPandit Nehru through him. There was general agreement that action shouldbe taken at once on these lines.11. Mr. NOEL-BAKER suggested that it would be desirable, in additionto the recognition of The King and the link of Commonwealth citizenship, to aim at a firm declaration by all Commonwealth Governments on the lines suggestedin paragraph 5 (ii) of the Law Officers&apos; Opinion.12.   After further discussion, the Meeting : (1) Agreed that the Ten Points could not be regarded as representingan adequate basis for India&apos;s continued membership of theCommonwealth.(2) Agreed that there would be advantage in concentrating on one or twosolid points rather than on a number of weak points which mightadmit of being attacked and demolished singly.(3) Agreed that Sir G. S. Bajpai should be invited to meet Mr. Noel-Bakerand the other Commonwealth representatives now in Paris, and shouldbe asked to convey to Pandit Nehru their very strong feeling of theimportance and desirability of India&apos;s recognising the jurisdiction of the Crown in the conclusion of Heads of States&apos; Treaties and theaccrediting of Ambassadors, possibly by way of a delegation of power under which the President of the Republic would act for these purposes has the representative of The King.36218
ANNEX note of Discussion in Dr. Evatt&apos;s room, Palais de Chaillot, Paris, at p.m. on Wednesday, 17th November, 1948Present : J1United Kingdom The Eight. Hon. P. J. Noel-Baker, M.P., Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations.Sir Gilbert Laithwaite, Commonwealth Relations Office.Hon. F. E. Cumming-Bruce, Commonwealth Relations Office.Canada The Hon. L. B. Pearson, Secretary of State for External Affairs.Mr. Norman Robertson, High Commissioner for Canada in London.A australia The Right Hon. H. V. Evatt, K.C., Deputy Prime Minister of Australia.The Right hon. J. A. Beasley, High Commissioner for Australia inLondon.New Zealand The Right Hon. Peter Fraser, Prime Minister of New Zealand.Mr. A. D. Mclntosh, Secretary for External Affairs.India    -Sir G. S. Bajpai.Mr. NOEL-BAKER thanked Sir G. S. Bajpai for responding to the invitation to come to discuss certain matters. Pandit Nehru&apos;s &quot; Ten Points &quot;had now been examined and an Opinion recorded on them by theLord Chancellor and the United Kingdom Law Officers, and the substance of that Opinion was, he understood, being conveyed to Pandit Nehru throughthe United Kingdom High Commissioner in India. When the UnitedKingdom and other Commonwealth representatives had met in Paris todiscuss the Irish position, the opportunity had been taken to communicate to the representatives of Canada, Australia and New Zealand Pandit Nehm&apos;s&apos;&apos; Ten Points &quot; and the Law Officers&apos; Opinion upon them. After a full discussionof these documents, it had been felt that there would be great advantage in holding a meeting with Sir G. S. Bajpai, in which the common feeling of those present could be conveyed to him.2. Dr. EVATT said that he had not himself known of the Ten Pointsuntil the last few days; that they had caused him some surprise, because whenPandit Nehru saw him and Mr. Beasley on 13th October he had understood(though the Prime Minister had entered into no great detail) that his approach was based on the retention of a link with the Crown in relation to India&apos;external affairs.3. SIR G. S. BAJPAI said that he had been present on this occasion.It was correct that details had not been discussed. Pandit Nehru had saidthat he was thinking in terms of Commonwealth citizenship as a basis of association between India and the rest of the Commonwealth. Developing in very general terms the position of The King, he had said that The King wouldbe the custodian of the human rights and privileges of an Indian citizen whowas also a Commonwealth citizen when that Indian citizen was in any Common-wealth country. Conversely, a Commonwealth citizen from New Zealand orAustralia or South Africa, if in India, would be, if he might so express it.the &quot;ward&quot; of the President of the Indian Republic, who, in regard to thisparticular function, would represent The King. So far as he had knowm ithad never been in Pandit Nehru&apos;s mind to retain a link through The Kingin the external field, and if he had in fact left that impression he thought there must have been some misunderstanding.
4. Dr. EVATT said that this had certainly not been the idea conveyedeither to him or to the Australian High Commissioner, but that he of courseaccepted what Sir G. S. Bajpai said. Commonwealth countries, and especiallyAustralia, were closely interested in this issue, and were anxious to see Indiaremain a member of the Commonwealth. The present discussions had followednaturally from discussions with Eire Ministers over the proposed repeal ofishe Eire Executive Authority (External Relations) Act, 1936, under which TheKing had hitherto accredited Eire representatives abroad. That had, in thecase of Eire, been the link with The King, but the Ten Points, so far as hecould see, contained no such link with The King for India and, if they were accepted, the link with The King would disappear. For his part (and he thoughtthat it was the feeling of the other Commonwealth representatives also)he would like to submit to the Government of India the great desirability ofmaintaining the link with The King. If The King could be retained as a link between India and the Commonwealth through his remaining responsible foraccrediting Indian representatives overseas, the position would be perfectly clear and easy, and there need be no question of the actual responsibility for appointment not resting with Indian Ministers. But, so far as he could see,there were no functions or powers assigned to The King under Pandit Nehru&apos;scheme.5. Sir G. S. BAJPAI suggested that there was some degree of link throughthe conception of Commonwealth citizenship, to the extent that citizenship wasin some way connected with the sovereignty which resided in The King. Indiaproposed to enact in her Constitution or in a Nationality Act provisions for commonwealth citizenship on the lines of the British Nationality Act of 1948.They were thus, negatively, not trying to be aliens and, positively, to bebeneficiaries of Commonwealth citizenship. They had felt that they could retain their membership of the Commonwealth by the tie of Commonwealth citizenship.6. Mr. PEARSON said that this point was fully appreciated. But he.and all others present, were looking for some other approach by means of TheKing. The Ten Points referred only to The King in connection with Honoursand as &quot; First Citizen,&quot; a conception that would not be popular in Canada.7. Mr. FRASER said that legally The King could not be a citizen of theState of which he was the Head. In his view, the Prime Minister of a Common-wealth country was the First Citizen. Thus, the Governor-General was not theFirst Citizen of Australia or Canada, but the Prime Minister.8. Dr. EVATT agreed with Mr. Fraser. He added that, if The King-were recognised by evidence of some of his positive functions, then his positionin relation to Honours would follow as an incident.9. Mr. NOEL-BAKER said that what was wanted was something strong and tangible which would help those present in their Parliaments, and wouldequally be a solid argument on which they could rely in an International Court ifchallenged in respect of most-favoured-nation treatment. All present felt thatthey would be greatly helped if it was possible for the Government of India tocontinue the present system, under which Indian diplomats were accredited byThe King and it was The King who signed Heads of States&apos; Treaties. Thatwould not be a new departure; it would be no more than a continuance of wellsettled practice. It would greatly ease the position from the international pointof view, particularly as over the last twelve years the link of the Irish external relations Act and the accrediting by The King of diplomats had been inter-nationally accepted as a satisfying test of Commonwealth membership in the caseof Eire.10. Sir G. S. BAJPAI said that he appreciated that it was not merelym the United Kingdom but in the other Commonwealth countries that there wasa strong sentiment for The King as the Head of the State, and that it mightbe difficult from their point of view to secure acceptance to a new conception of Commonwealth status if The King were eliminated or referred to only asthe First Citizen. But Pandit Nehru had formally moved the objectives of theIndian Constitution, Avhich contemplated India as a sovereign independentrepublic, and he had reaffirmed those objectives on his return to India a fewclays ago. He, Sir G. S. Bajpai, would readily communicate the substance of the present conversation, but he was pretty confident that, even if Pandit Nehruwished to do so, it would be impossible for the Indian Government to agree toabandoning the idea of a sovereign independent republic
11. THE UNITED KING-DOM REPRESENTATIVES said that therewas no suggestion that India should be asked to abandon the conception of are public. Their object was to try to devise a strong and tangible link between india and ourselves by way of The King.12. Mr. PEARSON pointed to the distinction between The King as asymbol of association and as Head of the State. In Canada, by a delegation made^by His Majestv on the advice of Canadian Ministers and effected, he thought, byamendment of&quot;the Governor-General&apos;s Letters Patent, the Governor-General had recently been given by the King viceregal powers. He could exercise all thepowers of His Majesty, though full advantage had not yet been taken of these powers by Canada, and documents in many cases were still submitted for TheKing&apos;s signature, even though legally the Governor-General had power to dispose of them.13. Mr. FRASER said that it was fully accepted that there would no longer be a Governor-General once the new Constitution came into being, but a Presidentof the Indian Republic. The President would have all the powers of a Governor-General. Would it not be possible, at that point, particularly in the light of theCanadian precedent which might be helpful, to bring in The King perhaps asHead of the British Commonwealth, as the connecting link between India andthe Commonwealth ?14. SIR G. S. BAJPAI enquired whether acceptance of The King as thesymbol of association would mean that His Majesty&apos;s approval would be necessaryin any form to the election by India of the President of the Indian Republic. Themeeting confirmed that this&quot; was not being suggested. If, he added, the position on the other hand was to be that Kingship was symbolic of power residing in theGovernment of India, that was, as he saw it, merely the present Dominion position,and it would not be possible for Pandit Nehru to secure acceptance of it. As forthe vesting of any functions in The King, this would, he thought, be likely toproduce insuperable difficulties with the Indian people and Parliament. Thatmight be true even of The King as a symbol. How, however, would The Kingfunction as a symbol ?15. Mr. PEARSON said that in Canada The King was the symbol of association. In the external field it was his signature that was used. But theright to accredit Ambassadors or sign Heads of States&apos; Treaties had now beendelegated by The King to the Governor-General. Would it not be possible towork out an arrangement for the assignment of corresponding powers by The Kingas a permanent arrangement to whoever might at the time be the President ofIndia ?16. Dr. EVATT said that the President elected under the constitution would discharge all internal functions. In relation to external affairs, he wouldfunction by reference to the authority of The King, who could be advised byIndian Ministers to assign those functions to the President, with the result thatno power would continue to reside in The King, but certain functions at presentperformed by him would be performed by the President as the result of a delega-tion by The King. While practice in Australia was not the same as in Canada,a general commission from His Majesty to the President would suffice. Suchan arrangement would not in any way affect the position or the political powerof the President, but it would provide a link through The King between Indiaand the Commonwealth, since the President would act in respect of the accreditingof Ambassadors, &amp;c, under the general authority delegated by The King, whichcould hold good permanently in respect of whoever might at the time be Presidentof the Republic, and could be embodied in a document counter-signed by thePrime Minister of India, which could be produced, if necessary, in a court as evidence of the relationship of India and the Commonwealth via The King. Thearrangement would not, in his view, need any statutory authorisation. Dr. Evattadded that he was anxious to maintain the relationship between the Common-wealth and India, and that his task and that of other Commonwealth countries would be greatly eased if we could point to the link through The King. unless they had something tangible to show their people, he and the representatives ofother Commonwealth countries would be in a very difficult position. An arrange-ment of this nature would, he thought, make it unnecessary to have a detailedarrangement such as was represented by the Ten Points.17. Mr. FRASER said that in the case of New Zealand there would be animmediate demand for a connecting link. The people of New Zealand were veryjealous of The Kmg&apos;s position, and the Government might be placed in a mos&quot;t
embarrassing position if it could be represented that they had agreed to anarrangement involving no link with the Crown. New Zealand was very anxiousto keep India in the Commonwealth; the future was dark; the position in china was disturbing. He thought New Zealand could help India, but his people wouldnot want to be attacked on the ground that they had let the British CommonwealthCdown by any arrangement to which they had come. They wanted some way ofnelping themselves as well as helping India. He thought that the arrangementnow suggested would be an appropriate recognition of the very fine stand whichthe United Kingdom Government had taken in relation to India. The relation-ship through citizenship, together with the connecting link of The King on thelines that had been adopted in Canada, would be satisfactory to public opinion in New Zealand.18. SIR G. S. BAJPAI said that he would be ready to convey to pandit nehru the sense of the meeting. To prevent misunderstanding he prepared thedraft of a telegram from himself to Pandit Nehru, of which a copy is appended to this record, in the terms of which the meeting concurred. He would add tothis a preamble, explaining the genesis of this discussion, and how it had arisenincidentally out&apos;of the Irish talks, opportunity having been taken by the repre-sentatives of the four Commonwealth Governments to give the most careful andsympathetic consideration to the Indian position; that a unanimous desire hadbeen expressed to keep India as a member of the Commonwealth; and that those present appreciated Pandit Nehru&apos;s difficulties and hoped that he would equallyappreciate theirs.19. The meeting warmly thanked Sir G. S. Bajpai for having come to meet them and for his very helpful and understanding attitude.Appendix to Annex BText of Message to be sent by Sir G. S. Bajpai to Pandit NehruWe have been thinking in terms of Commonwealth citizenship as link of association among Commonwealth countries. The feeling of all Dominion repre-sentatives who have been consulted is that it would be extremely difficult to get their Parliaments and people to eliminate King as link of such association:It is not suggested that India should not be sovereign republic or that Head ofState should be other than President elected according to provisions of indian constitution. What is suggested is that as symbol of Commonwealth associationauthority to appoint Heads of Missions abroad should derive from The King.This could be achieved by permanent delegation by King to President of IndianRepublic of power to appoint Heads of Missions. This would be done by president on advice of his Indian Ministers and delegation of King&apos;s power willbe done in exercise of his prerogative and will require no legislation either by our Legislature or by British Parliament.
