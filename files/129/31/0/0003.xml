HIS  DOCUMENT  IS   THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1948SECRET Copy No. 3 1CP. (48) 273ISth November, 1948CABINETACQUISITION OF  LAND AND BUILDINGS  FOR  THE  PUBLICSERVICEMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer have had under consideration the question of the most efficient machineryfor the acquisition of land and buildings by Government Departments. Atpresent the services of the Valuation Office of the Inland Revenue are not fullytaken advantage of for this purpose. District Valuers carry out both valuation and negotiation for most Departments (as they do for many acquisitions bylocal authorities), and this arrangement has proved in practice to work well. Butthe War Office, the Ministry of Works and the Forestry Commission normallycarry out their own negotiations, advice on valuation being sometimes, but not always, sought from the District Valuer; and the Agricultural Departments desireto operate a similar system for their acquisitions. This system is not, in my view, satisfactory, and since I have not been able to secure agreement on achange which I regard as very important I invite the Cabinet to consider thequestion.2. The concentration of all this work in the Valuation Office has long been desirable, since any divorce between valuation and negotiation is artificialand unbusinesslike. With the new basis of valuation introduced by the Townand Country Planning Acts of last year the case becomes even stronger. Thenew conception of &quot;existing use value,&quot; subject to certain tolerances and to exceptions in certain cases, requires an intimate knowledge of a highly compli-cated code, and the days when a valuer could exercise his art &quot; from his desk,&quot;if they ever existed, have now gone. He must inspect and negotiate if hisvaluation is to be thoroughly dependable, and one valuer cannot be expected tonegotiate efficiently on another&apos;s valuation. The District Valuer has to possess the necessary knowledge of the code as part of his normal equipment, and inmy view the businesslike course is clearly to entrust both valuation and negotiationin all cases to the expert machine which is maintained by the Government forthe purpose and does in fact already so function over a large part of the field.3. But the Town and Country Planning Acts do not merely institute anew and more complicated code of valuation. They provide that owners mayclaim for loss of development value against a global sum of  300 million, andthey impose a development charge on all development. For both these purposes(as for the purpose of acquisition price) the basic figure is &quot; existing use value &quot;as defined by the Acts, and for both purposes that value has to be assessedand negotiated by the District Valuer. The existing use value of all land and buildings with any development value or redevelopment value will therefore haveto be settled during the next few years by the Valuation Office machine forthe purpose of agreeing claims against the  300 million; and continually forthe purpose of development charge that machine will have to assess both &quot; existing use value &quot; and the value attributable to any proposed development, which willdetermine the new &quot; existing use value&quot; after the development. In all thesecases, therefore, the information necessary to determine the price at^ whichacquisition by a Government Department should take place (viz.. &quot; existing use value &quot;) will already have been ascertained by the District Valuer, and it seemsabsurd that another Government agent should be employed to go over the ground36157
again, with perhaps a different result. It might also be extremely embarrassingif the results were different.4. The intended effect of the Town and Country Planning Acts is to removeall development value from owners, but owners will naturally attempt to avoid the full effect by realising something better than true &quot;existing use value&quot;on selling their property. To the extent that they succeed, we shall find thatthe  300 million will have been wasted, that the cost of development and recon-struction will be increased, and that Budget revenue from development chargewill be lost. There is already plenty of evidence that the Planning Ministers,local authorities and Central Land Board (and the District Valuers as theiragents) are faced with a very hard task in ensuring that private sales takeplace on the new basis. It is very important that public acquisitions should notadd to the difficulties but should firmly and immediately be conducted on theprinciples and level of values which the District Valuer is attempting to applyelsewhere.5. If property is acquired by a Government Department at a price whichis above the level which the District Valuer is working to, or is calculated on different principles, that price will be quoted against the District Valuerin all his other negotiations on &quot;existing use value,&quot; and the possibility ofrepercussions will be very extensive. Not only will acquisitions of similar property in the locality by other Government Departments and local authorities be embarrassed, but also the settlement of claims against the  300 million, whilethe raising iof the level of &quot;existing use value &quot; will narrow the scope forthe levying of development charge. Accordingly an excess over the DistrictValuer&apos;s figure even in a.small case may in future have very prejudicial effects,both direct and indirect, on the Exchequer over ,a wide ,area.6. These arguments do not all apply with the same force to the acquisitionof property which has no development value at the date of acquisition; but eventhere I am convinced that the District Valuer should be used for negotiation.It often requires great skill and knowledge of the code to perceive whether there is in fact any value in the property over and a&apos;bove &apos;&apos; existing use value &quot;as defined in the Acts. In any case the District Valuer is in much the best position to find the proper value for acquisition by -reason of his other work(including other acquisitions, valuations for estate duty, &amp;c.) and his intimate knowledge both of the Acts and of the trend of the market values in his district(since all particulars ^of disposal by private treaty are by law transmitted tothe Inland Revenue Department for information). He is .a specialist with widerexperience than any other Government agent, and is the only one with the wholepicture (both from the compensation and the taxation angle) before him. Heis thus able to secure some consistency in values and argument from privatesurveyors and owners whose interest is sometimes to fix values high and sometimeslow. It is impossible for him to convey his background knowledge to anothervaluer, if only because much of it is confidential to the Inland Revenue, and,even if he could, that valuer obviously could not use such second-hand informationso effectively in negotiation as the man who knows it directly and in full detail.7. I have therefore reached the conclusion that I cannot give financialauthority for acquisitions ^whether in pursuance of compulsory powers or not)at prices which have not been approved by the District Valuer, and since, for reasons above stated, it is not practicable or realistic to expect him to give avaluation -without first contacting the owner, it follows in my view that thepresent anomaly whereby he conducts negotiations on behalf of most Departmentsbut not all should be brought -to an end.8. I would also point out that generally speaking the Government insist,as a condition of grant to local authorities, that the District Valuer should conduct negotiations on their behalf. Here too there are anomalous exceptionswhich it is now very desirable to remove. The Minister of Town and country planning has been acting accordingly in relation to acquisitions under the Townand Country Planning Act, using the arguments set out in this memorandum,and the other grant-paying Departments are considering similar action in theirfields. The position of these Ministers in arguing with unwilling legal authorities will be much weakened if the Government^ own house is not in order; and theMinister of Town and Country Planning has felt hound to defer making thegrant regulations under his recent Act-which, as the Act itself contemplated,make negotiation by the District Valuer a condition of grant until the presentquestion is decided.   The regulations cannot be held up much longer.
9. The Lord President^ Committee have now agreed in principle (L.P. (48)16th Meeting) to legislation substituting a new and stronger system for the officialarbitrators appointed under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensa-tion) Act, 1919, in view of the great importance of securing strong, expert andconsistent administration of the new valuation code. It is obviously even moreimportant to secure this at the administrative than at the judicial level.10. The Valuation Office machine is, of course, under a heavy strain as aresult of recent and prospective new duties, but it is being steadily strengthened,and I am satisfied that my proposal, which would add proportionately very little to the Valuation Office&apos;s work (probably well below 5 per cent.), would not slowdown the process of acquisition by the Departments in question : indeed in manycases it would save time as compared with the present system. In any eventI will ensure that District Valuers have instructions to accord to acquisitionsby Government Departments the priority appropriate in each case in relationto their other work.Summary11.   I summarise the main arguments as follows : (i) The Valuation Office is the organisation maintained by the Governmentfor the assessment and negotiation of land values for all public purposes, and the District Valuer is in a much better position thananyone else to carry out this work,(ii) Over a small proportion of the field other Government agents are stillemployed on similar duties.   This is not businesslike.(iii) To the extent that the other Government agents reach a different answer.the embarrassments will now be very serious and the repercussionsvery costly.(iv) Much wider matters are at stake than the interests of the few Depart-ments which still do not use the normal machinery, but in fact those interests should not suffer from the change, since the existing practicedoes not work satisfactorily and the normal practice has been provedby experience to do so.conclusion accordingly ask my colleagues to agree in principle that, for all purchases,long leases and sales by Government Departments in the United Kingdom, theservices of the District Valuer should be used for valuation and for negotiation.Transitional arrangements regarding cases already in hand, &amp;c, can then besettled at the official level (as they have been in the case of the Air Ministry,who recently agreed at the request of my predecessor to modify their practiceas I now propose).I should add that at a preliminary discussion I held with the ministers concerned it was suggested that the necessary results could be secured by consul-tation between the District Valuer and the departmental valuer locally, with aco-ordinating committee on matters of principle at the centre. Thorough discus-sion of this suggestion at the official level has, however, showed that it couldnot be agreed to be a satisfactory solution. I should not myself regard it asmeeting the important objects which I have in view.R. S. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,ISth November, 1948.
