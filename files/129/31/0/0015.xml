THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT102Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1948TOP SECRETGopy^No.   31CP. (48) 2852Qth November, 1948CABINETCURRENCY SITUATION IN BERLINMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs a month has passed since the Resolution on the situation in Berlin,prepared by the six &quot;neutral&quot; members in the Security Council, was acceptedby the representatives of the French, United States and United Kingdom Govern-ments, and vetoed by the Soviet representative. Dr. Bramuglia, the ArgentineChairman of the Security Council, is now making a further attempt to finda way of reconciling the Eastern and Western requirements in Berlin; he hascirculated a questionnaire to the four Governments asking for their views inmore detail than he has had before on how the quadripartite control of Berlincurrency and trade is to be carried out; and unofficial exploratory conversationsare taking place on the basis of the replies that have been sent to him on theone hand by the three Western Governments and on the other by the SovietGovernment. But it would be unwise to count on success in the light of ourpast experience and of the preparations which the Soviet authorities appearto be making in Berlin to complete the splitting of the city into two parts.2. Meanwhile, the currency situation in the Western Sectors of Berlinis becoming increasingly unsatisfactory. The arrangement under which both theWestern Mark (overstamped B) and the Eastern Mark were allowed to circulatefreely and both were legal tender for certain purposes in these Sectors, was onlysuitable as a stopgap for a short period. With the passage of time it has been shown to possess increasingly serious economic drawbacks, and these have had such an effect on the political feeling of the inhabitants of Western Berlin thatwe are in danger of losing on this account much of the goodwill which we havebuilt up through our stand against the Russians and the maintenance of theair-lift.3. The present situation is described in detail in the annexed paper, which sets out the various courses of action open to us. The course described inApafagTaph fw-ftP) would probably be the best. With the agreement of theChancellor of the Exchequer I have instructed General Robertson to discuss it with the French and United States Military Governors, with a view to reaching agreement on the best plan to put into operation from the technical point ofview-; I have made it clear that these discussions must take place without commitment on the matter of principle, since it is for the three governments to make the decision whether so serious a step is to be taken, and if so, at whatmoment.4. As pointed out in the paper, it is probable that the local elections inBerlin on 5th December will result in the further division of the city into two halves and in increased pressure upon us to alter the present currencyarrangements in the Western Sectors. I hope that by that time or soon after-wards we shall know whether the new initiative in the Security Council holds36197b
2any promise of success. If it is then clear that no advantage would be gained by waiting any longer, the three Governments will/have, to consider whether to go forward with a plan based on that proposed in the attached paper, modifiedif necessary as a result of the technical discussions between the Military Governorsin Germany. Although Mr. Marshall recently suggested in Paris that we oughtto take a decision of principle now but to delay putting it into effect until afterthe Berlin elections and until after the Security Council has left Paris, the UnitedStates Delegation in Paris has now accepted my view that this would be unwiseand that we should wait until after 5th December before making up our minds.I am sure that the news that we had made a decision on what to do if the talks failed would leak out and reduce the chances of the talks being successful.5. I shall consult my colleagues before entering into any definite commit-ments with the United States and French Governments on a new currency plan for the Western Sectors of Berlin, but in view of the complexity of the subject and the possibility that a decision may be required at short notice, I should like my colleagues to have an opportunity of studying the proposals in theattached paper.E. B.Foreign Office, S. W.1,29th November, 1948.ANNEXCURRENCY SITUATION IN BERLINI. Existing PositionSince the currency reform in June the East Mark issued by the German Bankof Emission for the Soviet Zone circulates as sole legal tender in the Easternsector of Berlin. The Russians claim that their law also applies to the western sectors. Possession of the Western Zone Mark in the Eastern sector is a penaloffence and people are arrested if they are found to have Western Zone Marksin their possession. - -    ,In the three Western sectors, which form one currency area, both the bastMark and the Western Zone Mark are allowed to circulate freely. The WesternZone Mark is over-stamped or perforated with a &quot;B,&quot; but has remained legaltender in the Western Zones, although not formally included among the liabilities of the Bank Deutsche Lander. In the Western sectors of Berlin it is legal tender for all purposes, whereas the East Mark is legal tender for some purposes only.Payment for essentials such as food rations, rent, gas, transport and taxes, canbe made in either currency, but for semi-essentials or non-essentials the sellercan demand payment in West Marks, and as they are the more valuable currency,he almost always does so. The aim of the Western Allies, which has been veryimperfectly realised in practice, was that all wages and salaries should be paidin the proportion of 75 per cent. East Marks and 25 per cent. West Marks.In theory this was designed to ensure that all essentials could be obtained withthe East Mark portion of the salary while the West Mark portion would beavailable for non-essentials and semi-essentials. Apart from these arrangementsthere is no official link between the two currencies, but private dealers have alwaysquoted the East Mark at a discount and for some weeks the rate has been4 East Marks to 1 West Mark.II. Reasons for Present arrangements the Western Zone Mark was introduced into the Western Sectors of Berlinbecause the Russians refused to put the circulation of the East Mark in the cityunder quadripartite authority. To have accepted the East Mark as the exclusivecurrency of Berlin in the absence of quadripartite control would have meantgiving up both formally and in practice our right to an equal share in thegovernment of the city. The circulation of West Marks in the Western sectorswas, however, strictly limited in order, to avoid prejudicing the possibility ofsecuring an agreement with the Russians by which the East Mark would become,
under quadripartite&apos; authority, the sole currency for the whole of Berlin.Subsidiary reasons for the policy of limitation were to protect the value of theWest Mark in Berlin by restricting the supply and to limit the repercussions inthe Western zones of possible credit inflation in Berlin.III. Drawbacks of Existing Arrangements(a) The failure of the Western Allies to introduce a 100 per cent. WesternZone Mark currency in the Western sectors caused great disappointment andanxiety, and the retention of the East Mark as legal tender was regarded as a sign of weakness. The suspicion then created that the Western Allies might at anytime give way to the Russians on the currency question and thereby put the Cityat their mercy has never been wholly eradicated.. (&amp;) Neither the Western Allies nor the magistrate control the supply of EastMarks, and the currency position in the Western sectors has therefore to that extent been dependent on the Russians. At times there has been a great shortageof East Marks and the payment of workers, including those engaged on suchessential tasks as unloading at Gatow Airport, has been delayed for a week orten days.(c) The aim that wages and salaries should be paid 75 per cent, in EastMarks and 25 per cent, in West Marks has never in practice been met. Theproportion varies according to the ability of individual firms to obtain WestMarks and East Marks. For example, firms dealing with essential commoditiestend to take in East Marks only, while those which cater for non-essentialsreceive West Marks almost exclusively. Thus, some workers receive up to75 per cent, of their pay in West Marks, while others receive nothing butEast Marks. Since the exchange dealers give about four East Marks forone West Mark, this produces great discrepancies in purchasing power. details are given at Appendix &quot;A.&quot;(d) The distinction between essentials which can be purchased with EastMarks and semi-essentials or non-essentials which can only be bought with WestMarks may have been applicable for a short period after currency reform, but has become progressively less real. Articles like clothing, shoes, or medicine,which can be bought only with West Marks, must be considered as essentialsover a period of six months or more. The stage has already been reached atwhich many workers cannot meet their essential expenditure even if they receive25 . per cent, of their pay in West Marks. Some examples are given at appendix &quot; B.&quot;The position has thus been reached at which real wages no longer dependon a worker&apos;s ability or energy but on the accident of whether his employer isin a position to include a substantial amount of West Marks in his wage packetor not. Dissatisfaction among the working population has led to increasing-pressure on the trade unions and political parties. Strikes have already beenthreatened and the leaders of the anti-Communist trade union organisation in theWestern sectors (U.G.O.) have warned Military Government that unless matters are soon remedied, they will have no option but to support strikes. unless they do so, they will lose the confidence of their members and will be unable to counteract the influence of the Communist F.D.G-B., whose agents are extremelyactive in the Western sectors. The political parties have continuously pressed for a change ever since currency reform was introduced, and as early as14th August they presented a memorandum to the three Western Allies asking for the introduction of a 100 per cent. West Mark currency in the western sectors. On 4th. November the City Assembly passed a solution instructing theMagistrat to reopen negotiations with the Western Allies on the basis of thememorandum of 14th August.If the present position is allowed to continue, the possibility of seriousdisorders cannot be ruled out. These would of course play into Russian hands,and the political and trade union leaders might therefore be expected to use their influence to prevent them. They will do so up to a point, but this is amatter on which they would be prepared to go further in openly opposing theWestern Allies than on any other, because they believe that the present unsatis-factory position is due solely to the mistaken policy of the Western Allies andnot to action by the Russians, and could be changed overnight if the western allies so wished.The Berlin population will be prepared to put up with almost any hardshipso long as this is directly attributable to the Russians and the Western Allies36197 b 2
are demonstrably doing their bast to overcome it. The hardship and injusticecaused by the currency situation, however, are regarded as the fault of theWestern Allies alone, and they are progressively dissipating the goodwill whichwe^have built up by the air-lift and by our resolute stand against the Russians.The position in the Western sectors this winter may well be very critical, andthe universal and increasing resentment over the currency situation might prove the decisive factor which would lose us Berlin.IV. Possible Courses of Action(A) The present position could be allowed to continue.The advantages of this course are that it would avoid giving any extraprovocation to the Russians or any conceivable excuse for an accusation thatwe are infringing the Security Council&apos;s resolution enjoining the four allies to &quot; prevent any incident which would be of a nature such as to aggravate the present position in Berlin.&quot; It would also be in line with the views ofthe French, who are anxious about Soviet reactions and do not wish to linkthe Western sectors of Berlin too closely with the Western zones. The disadvan-tages are that the Americans are strongly opposed to inaction, and that, forthe reasons explained above, if the present position continues the hold of theWestern Allies on Berlin will be seriously threatened. After all the expenditureof effort and money to hold our position there, it would make little sense to lose all we have fought for through failure to remedy this situation.(B) The circulation of West Marks could be increased and it might beprovided by law that all purchases, as well as wages and salaries, should beon a 50 per cent. East Mark/50 per cent. West Mark basis.This would have the same advantages as (A) and it would also go someway towards remedying the anomalies of the present situation. The disadvantagesare that it would not be acceptable to the population of the Western sectorsor to the political and trade union leaders. It would also leave us dependentto some extent on East Marks and, therefore, on the Russians. Finally, theadministrative arrangements would be complicated and might well prove impossible to enforce.(C) The Western Zone Mark (still with a distinctive &quot; B &quot; but in all other respects formally and legally identical with the Western Zone Deutschemark)could be introduced on a 100 per cent, basis, the East Mark ceasing to be legaltender. There would, however, be no ban on the possession of East Marks, and people could use them in so far as they wished to do so.This is the solution for which the Americans are pressing, and it would havethe advantage of eliminating most of the present inequalities and the grievancesto which they give rise. It would be wholeheartedly welcomed by the Germanpopulation in the Western sectors. It would also free us from the partial control which the Russians at present exercise over the financial position of the western sectors of Berlin. The disadvantages are that it would be regarded by theRussians as a most provocative step, and might also be regarded as contraveningthe Security Council Resolution if it were undertaken at present. The Frenchare also strongly opposed to it for the reasons given at (A) above.(D) A Berlin West Mark could be introduced on a 100 per cent, basis, theEast Mark ceasing to be legal tender but continuing to circulate -as in (C).The difference between this and course (C) is that the West Mark in Berlinwould be divorced from the currency of the Western zones. The official rate ofexchange would be one for one, but transfers between the two areas would besubject to exchange control. This is a compromise solution which the military governor has put forward. General Clay at the time rejected it categorically;and the best that can be said of the French reaction is that they would regard itas considerably less objectionable than (C) because it involves no link betweenthe banking systems of Berlin and the Western Zones. It is, however, a corn-promise between the American and French views, and it is possible that bothTWll 5 was      perSUf deAut0 ifr-   As regards the local position inufh  St    6 m0St 0f,-S6 advanfcages of course (C) and would also giveWestern Zon^ l^T^ SF^S policy  in *erlin from that in theSfcfmnfS; i wS alo deny the- Russians the possibility of financingas the, ZT*?nrSJf fWestern Zone Marks from Berlinund^course fe?Ttft ^ ?0u]d be able to do ^en more easilyunder course (C).  On the other hand, trade between the Western Sectors of Berlin
and the Soviet Zone would be more restricted than under (C), because suppliersin the Soviet Zone would be less anxious to hold Berlin West Marks whenthey were no longer legal tender in the Western. Zones. There is also an element of uncertainty in that Soviet propaganda might be able to shake the confidence of the Berliners in a West Mark currency divorced from that of the: western zones. This risk would be reduced if a reasonably generous policy were adopted towards transfers of money from Berlin to Western Germany, and it is consideredthat, with this provision, the risk could be accepted. The disadvantages of thiscourse are that, like course (C), it might, if taken at present, be interpreted ascontrary to the Security Council Resolution. It would also be provocative to theRussians, though considerably less so than course (C),V. Reactions on U.N.O. and the RussiansThe reactions of the six &quot; neutral &quot; powers in the Security Council to course(C) or (D) might possibly be unfavourable for the reason given above, namely thatthey might be regarded as tending to aggravate the present situation in Berlin.It should be emphasised, however, that neither course (C) nor course (D) would render impossible a subsequent agreement with the Russians for the introductionof the East Mark as the sole currency for Berlin under quadripartite authority,although the withdrawal of the West Mark from Berlin would undoubtedly be easier under course (D) than under course (C). The possibility of an unfavourablereaction from the Security Council may well depend on the question of timing and must in any case be weighed against the serious consequences on the localposition in Berlin which may result from inaction or half-hearted action.Either course (C) or course (D) would be resented by the Russians and itmust be expected that they would take counter-measures. It is difficult to see,however, what more they could do than they are already doing. They would nodoubt try to tighten the ring round the Western sectors, but they have been doing this for some weeks. They might also intensify their efforts to undermine theWest Mark in Berlin, but there is no reason to suppose that they would be more effective than they have been so far. They might use this step as an excuse forthe formal division of Berlin. In this respect, timing may be of cardinalimportance. The Berlin elections are due to be held on 5th December, and it now seems certain that they will be limited to the Western sectors, and will resultin the final division of the city and in the establishment by the Russians of puppetorganisations to run their sector. *Course (C) or course (D) might make the Russians less willing to reopennegotiations for a Berlin settlement. However, this does not necessarily follow.Failure by the Western Allies to deal firmly with the currency situation in theWestern sectors might well be interpreted as a sign of weakness. The Russiansmust also be aware of the dissatisfaction which the present position is causing,and if nothing is done to remedy it, they may well be encouraged to persist withthe blockade in the hope that with the added difficulties which winter will bring,the Western Allies can be forced to give way. On the other hand, if the currencyposition, which at present is our greatest source of weakness in Berlin, is demon-strably strengthened, the Russians may be less hopeful of succeeding in a policyof attrition and more willing to consider negotiations.VI. -TimingThere is no exact date by which it can be said that from the local Berlin anglea change must be introduced. The present position is, however, deteriorating,and it is desirable that steps should be taken to remedy it as quickly as possible.The elections on 5th December may well affect the issue. If, as is almost certain,they lead to a formal division of the City, the pressure from the Germans for a currency change &quot;will increase, and for financial reasons alone it may become necessary to take quick action. As far as can be foreseen, therefore, the change should take place as soon as possible after the elections, and should certainly not be postponed beyond 31st December.We are not yet in a position to put either course (C) or course (D) into&apos; effect immediately. We have still to reach agreement with the Americans and theFrench; and it is also intended to consult the Germans, both technicians and poli-ticians. If this consultation is to be more than a formality, sufficient time mustbe allowed for the Germans to suggest amendments and for the Allies to consider them, and for this purpose a minimum of about two weeks should be allowed.  The
whole process, which will include the drafting of detailed legislation, cannot beexpected to take less than four to five weeks; so that, if we are to be able to take action before the end of the year, should we wish to do so, we must press on withthe present technical discussions in Germany.VII. Recommendations.. : The following recommendations are accordingly made : (a) As soon as the Berlin elections are over, the decision should be taken toadopt either course (C) or course (D) without further delay, unless. before then the negotiations in Paris have developed in such a way as to make action of this kind clearly inappropriate.(b) Meanwhile, in the confidential discussions which General Robertson ishaving with Generals Clay and Koenig, he will continue to seek agree-ment on the actual plan to be put into effect if and when the decisionto go ahead has been taken, so that the technical details can be worked out in advance. He will try to secure acceptance of course (D); and,if this is not possible, will report back for further instructions. Hewill make it clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government are not preparedto take an immediate decision to put either plan into effect. We under-stand that this is also the attitude of the United States Government.Appendix &apos;&apos; A &quot;The following table shows the discrepancy in purchasing power for workers of different firms earning the same total amount of Marks per week, but paidin varying proportions of West and East Marks.Name of Firm WSiemens Schuckert      ...      ...A.E.G.......Telef unken       ...      ...Loewe WerkzeugmaschinenAutomaticAuer-GesellschaftNeumannChemodurBamag Meguin ...It is, therefore, impossible to avoid grave discrepancies under thesecircumstances.
