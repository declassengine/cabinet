ItHIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS   BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOYERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1948SECRET Copy No. 3 1CP. (48) 290Qth December, 1948CABINETACQUISITION OF LAND BY THE WAR DEPARTMENTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for WarTHE memorandum on this subject dated 18th November (CP. (48) 273) bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer presents only one side of the case. Before theCabinet decide I think they should hear the other side.2. The concentration of Government work on purchase of lands and buildings in one department is an old question, which was discussed at Cabinetlevel after the first world war and dropped. The present proposal that the valuation Office of the Inland Revenue Department should undertake valuation and negotiation for purchase, &amp;c, of land required by the War Office has changedmore than once since it was originally put forward, both in scope and in the reasons give for it. The first proposal was that the Inland Revenue Valuation office should deal only with future purchases of new land by agreement, but not with compulsory purchase or the purchase of requisitioned land, &amp;c, which has tobe acquired as an aftermath of the war. Now the Inland Revenue would under-take both compulsory and aftermath purchases. The original argument for theproposal was economy in valuation staff. The main reasons now given relate tothe advantage of concentrating valuation and negotiation in one office, havingregard particularly to the conditions created by the Town and Country PlanningActs, 1947.3. The practical difficulties involved for War Office administration by theChancellor&apos;s proposals, which have been fully explained to the Chancellor and his predecessor, are dealt with later in this paper. Before coming to them, I should like to comment briefly on the arguments adduced for putting all Governmentvaluation and negotiation work under one department, which are mainly thefollowing : (a) The importance of not divorcing valuation from negotiation.(b) The complications in valuation arising from the Town and country planning Acts, 1947.(c) The advantage of using the valuation work which the Inland RevenueValuation Office Avill have to do in the next few years in connectionwith the Town and Country Planning Acts in any case.(d) The prejudicial effect on budget revenue and the Exchequer generally if government Departments pay more than they should.(e) The general skill and resources available to District Valuers comparedwith those of other Departments.4. With regard to (a), I agree that there is advantage in joining negotiationto valuation, but this is fully secured at present by the valuation and negotiationboth being carried out by the War Office valuation staff, and I do not accept theassumption that the valuation and, therefore, the negotiation, must be done by the inland Revenue. I can see no reason why, with a system of consultation, thevaluations of other Departments should not be sufficiently co-ordinated by a com-parison of notes with the Inland Revenue Valuation Office, as has often been donein the past. Furthermore, in the process of acquisition of land by a Service36247
2Department, valuation and negotiation are only part of a long chain of production.If valuation and negotiation are withdrawn from the province of the organisation which has to consider as a preliminary, all the military and planning conditions ofthe proposed purchase, the relative merits of different sites and also the subsequentuse of the property, there is another and more serious divorce of responsibilities.- 5 On the arguments based on the complication of the Town and country planning Acts and the general skill of District Valuers ((b) and (e) in paragraph 3),I am advised that the general effect of the Acts in excluding development valuefrom consideration should be to simplify rather than render more difficult the task of the valuer. The provisions relating to the particular case of acquisition ofproperty such as house property are certainly complicated, but are transitory andaffect only a small element of War Office work, which can easily be dealt with bythe War Office valuation staff with or without consultation with the InlandRevenue. As regards relative skill and resources, I certainly cannot agree thatthe experience of District Valuers, many of them recently recruited, is likely to bebetter adapted to the type of purchase made for War Office requirements thanthat of the War Office Valuers who have specialised for a long time in this par-ticular work. The prospect of employing the Revenue Valuers, who are primarilytaxation officials, on such negotiations in particular as those for the large militarytraining areas at Dartmoor^ Stanford, &amp;c, is somewhat incongruous to anyonewith practical acquaintance with the work and the history of these areas.6. I am particularly disturbed by the suggestion at (c), which I fear wouldmean in practice that my Department would in effect have to postpone much ofits purchase work until in the course of years the Inland Revenue had completed its work in connection with the Town and Country Planning Acts. The War office has a large mass of post-war acquisitions to carry out within time limits laiddown by Parliament which were recently extended by the Requisitioned land and War Works Act, 1948. It would be most dangerous to have to wait for the revaluation of the country which is to be undertaken by the Inland RevenueValuation Office before doing any more work on such acquisitions, even ifordinary Departmental business could afford to stand over for some years. I note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer says that he is satisfied that the processof acquisition by Departments would not be slowed down and that appropriatepriority would be given to such acquisitions in relation to the other work of theDistrict Valuers, but I doubt whether in practice the Inland Revenue ValuationDepartment would seriously interrupt its vast revaluation programme in order togive priority to particular properties in which Departments were interested fromthe point of view of purchase.7. The main point, however, on which I must differ from the Chancellor is contained in the argument at (d) of paragraph 3 that if higher prices than are justified are paid by Departments other than the Inland Revenue, the intendedeffects of the Town and Country Planning Acts and Budget revenue will beimperilled. What grounds are there for supposing that other Departments will infact pay excessive prices, particularly if there is a reasonable element of consultation ?The fear that the level of land prices would remain too high simply becauseGovernment Departments would pay higher prices than they should, and thatthis would make it difficult for full development charges to be imposed ondevelopers, is, I feel, much exaggerated. The amount of land purchase carriedout by the War Office, though involving a large number of acquisitions from thepoint of view of the Department, is of course, small in relation to purchasetransactions in the country as a whole. Further, the danger alleged arises only where development land is purchased. War Office purchases include, under thepresent programme, only a very small element of development land, and this is often fully developed already and not subject to further development charges.In the relatively few cases where, the War Office would buv land subject to development charges, it should be quite easy to arrive at the right Governmentprice by consultation if desired, without upsetting the present War Office organisa-tion. In any case, valuation even by the Inland Revenue Valuation Office is by no means an exact science, as is shown by the fact that the War Office has beenold by the Inland Revenue Valuation Office that if they negotiate purchases.hey will wish to be allowed to revise their valuation upwards if necessary, i.e.,in effect to have a negotiating margin above their original valuation, and this hasin fact been the experience m a number of Territorial Army cases eg in a recent case dealt with by a District Valuer the original valuation was eventuallyincreased by 40 per cent, and the property secured at this price
8.   I am, however, mainly concerned not so much with the effect of centralisaL;tion (or over-centralisation) on valuation work, as with the difficulties whichwill arise in War Office administration as a consequence of these proposals.(a) Delay and lack of touch with military requirementsAt all stages of the land purchase, reference to and fro would benecessary between the War Office and the Inland Revenue Department, witha danger of delay at each stage and of cumulative delays which might well become formidable. In addition, during the actual conduct of negotiations,points are bound to arise regarding settlement which an outside departmentcannot dispose of as expeditiously as a branch of the War Office in close touch with other branches and familiar with their requirements. It can hardly be assumed that the work of valuation and purchasing would be asefficiently conducted by a Department not concerned exclusively with thespecial requirements of the War Office but with many other importantpreoccupations. I do not know enough of the organisation of the Depart-ments for which the Inland Revenue Valuation Office already acts to judgehow far they have anything comparable with the problems of purchase for the Army, or how far the efficiency of their arrangements would be improved if they had their own valuation and purchasing staff, but fromthe point of view of the War Office it is clear that the proposal is mostunbusinesslike, cumbrous and likely to lead to delay and inefficiency.(b) Emergencies and overseas work  the Inland Revenue would not under the Chancellor&apos;s proposals dealwith the greatly increased work arising in emergencies, particularly inconnection with requisitions. For this, it would be necessary that the WarOffice should have a nucleus of valuers practised in current valuations andnot purely in estate management. Again, the War Office will have toprovide for lands work abroad in peace and in war, and this cannot bedone satisfactorily without a home establishment of War Office valuers. skilled in every branch of the work from which drafts and reliefs may be posted. The recent reminders we have had of the danger of a new emergencymake it the more untimely to disrupt the present War Office arrangements.(c) Waste of skilled qualificationsThe War Office must in any case keep trained professional staff to administer its estates. If this staff, whose training and qualifications includevaluation, are precluded from doing the work of valuation and negotiation,their professional qualifications will to that extent be wasted.(d) Effect on staffIt is highly undesirable to recruit professional staff whose work in peace-time will be restricted to estate management. This is a point which is strongly felt by the staff themselves. The proposal made by the chancellor was, I understand, originally put forward by the Departmental Unionof the Inland Revenue Valuation Office who naturally think that office should have a monopoly of Government valuation work, but it may be veryunwelcome to the general professional Union to which the War Office staffbelong and which, so far as I am aware, has not been consulted.(e) Effect on post-war purchase programmesA great deal of work is in hand for the acquisition of training land and war-time buildings.   This has already been much delayed by planning dis-cussions. A change of organisation dividing the work of acquisition between two departments would further upset, the prospect of carrying it through;  expeditiously.As the Chancellor admits, the Inland Revenue Valuation Office, which isto undergo an enormous expansion, will be severely strained by the work put on it,and I believe it has already declined work considered desirable by the Govern-ment on account of staff difficulties. I have already indicated in paragraph 6 abovemy fear that urgent War Office work would have to take a back seat until the inland Revenue Valuation office can get round to it, and this is a position whichI am not willing to accept, particularly when I have the means of carrying outthe work ready to hand. .
9. That these objections to the Chancellors proposals do not derive fromany obstinate desire to retain functions and responsibilities is shown by the factthat I have already agreed to let the work of purchasing properties for theTerritorial Army be undertaken by the Inland Revenue Valuation Office. the surrender of this work is in no way inconsistent with my general thesis. TheTerritorial Army requirements generally speaking, are of a limited and moreor less standardised nature, on which District Valuers can well be instructed bythe local Territorial Army Associations, although their use is not entirely free from difficulties and disadvantages. This work has normally been carried out under local arrangements in the past, except where compulsory purchase was involved, and the practical objections, which I have mentioned, to removal of thewhole of the headquarter valuation and purchase negotiations from the WarOffice valuation staff do not apply in the same way. It may well be that similar considerations apply over most of the field in which the Inland Revenue ValuationOffice already act for other Departments.10. To sum up, there is no advantage that I can see in the centralisation of valuation and negotiation for land and buildings in the manner proposed, Avhichcannot equally well be achieved, in the few cases of development land with whichthe War Office is likely to be concerned, by a system of consultation. On theother hand, the withdrawal of this work from the War Office would give rise tomany delays and difficulties in administration in peace, and still more in emer-gency. Excellent arguments might no doubt be adduced for handing over thewhole of the building work of the Royal Engineers to the Ministry of Works,the R.A.S.C. to the Transport Commission, the R.A.O.C. to the Ministry ofSupply, the R.A.M.C. to the Health Service, and so on. But if the Army hasnot got services of this sort for itself, it ceases to be a viable institution in peace and is paralysed in war. The same consideration applies in large measure to services in connection with land.11. I have made references above to the possibility of a system of consulta-tion, which I do not regard as really necessary, since the skilled and experiencedWar Department valuation staff is at least as likely to protect the public interest at the District Valuers, but which could, I am sure, quite easily be set up, if desired. I do not agree that the Departmental discussions which have been heldshow such a system to be impossible. It is true that officials of the three Depart-ments concerned failed to persuade the Treasury and the Inland Revenue Valua-tion Office that such a system was a satisfactory solution, but this is perhapshardly surprising, seeing that the Treasury have been pressing the present pro-posals, in one form or another, periodically since the 1920&apos;s.12. Finally I should like to comment on the Chancellors summary ofarguments in paragraph 11 of CP. (48) 273. The first argument seems to meto beg the question, as does the second. The third rests on the assumption, whichis quite unjustified, that other Government Departments pay the wrong price.The fourth again begs the question, since in my view the existing practice islikely to work much more satisfactorily than that which the Chancellor calls the&quot;normal&quot; one, which has, in fact, never existed or been tested by experienceso far as War Department requirements and organisation are concerned. in point of fact, far more important administrative factors would from my pointof view be ignored, if the present system were scrapped, than any benefit resultingfrom valuation and negotiation becoming the complete monopoly of one Govern-ment office.13.   I hope the Cabinet will decide that (i) there shall be no change in the present organisation, but(n) there shall, if this is desired, be the fullest consultation between the WarOffice and the Inland Revenue Valuation Office where purchases ofland with development value are concerned, and that both Departmentsshall be instructed to co-operate fully to this end;(iii) in any case, any change of organisation should be postponed until thewar aftermath work has been dealt with and the possibility of an earlyemergency has become remote.E.
