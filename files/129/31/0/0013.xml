THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT. ... . S98Printed for the Cabinet.   November 194SSECRET Copy No. 3 1CP. (m) 2832Qth November, 1948CABINETCOMMONWEALTH CONSULTATIONMemorandum by the Prime minister circulate for the information of my colleagues the text of recommendations on Commonwealth consultation which it was agreed at the recent Prime Ministers&apos;Meeting should be submitted to ail Commonwealth Governments in this formfor approval. It was also agreed, having regard especially to the possibility that Commonwealth Governments might soon be pressed to give information about these recommendations in their Parliaments, that Commonwealth governments should be invited to reach decisions on them as quickly as possible, and in any event by the end of November. It was further agreed that in the meanwhile thereshould be no publication of the recommendations in any country.2. I suggest that the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations should now be authorised to inform other Commonwealth Governments that the UnitedKingdom Government, for their part, approve these recommendations and willbe pleased to give effect to them if other Commonwealth Governments also concur.3. Recommendation (6) concerns defence. Mr. St. Laurent, speaking onbehalf of Canada, said that in view of the historic position of Canada he wishedto make it clear, so far as Canada was concerned, that, in agreeing to arrangeco-operative action in matters of defence, it would be unreal for Canada to regard as effective either general or regional plans of defence which wouldcomprise Commonwealth countries exclusively and which did not include otherpeace-loving countries who are prepared to co-operate in resisting aggression.This statement was acceptable to all Commonwealth representatives, including,of course, those of the United Kingdom, whose Western Union discussions arethereby safeguarded.4.   We have not ourselves yet worked out in detail the practical machineryfor giving effect to recommendation (6) if it is accepted by all Commonwealth36187a
2Governments. The Minister of Defence and the Secretary of State for Common-wealth Relations have this under consideration.5. It may be that it will be necessary to agree to certain modifications inthe recommendations in the light of the views expressed by other commonwealth governments. In that event it may be necessary to submit the matter again tothe Cabinet, but in the meantime I recommend that the Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations be authorised to inform other commonwealth governments as proposed in paragraph 2 above.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S. W. 1,26th November, 1948.f
SECRETANNEXTEXT OF RECOMMENDATIONS AGREED AT MEETING of prime MINISTERSDiscussions during the meeting have demonstrated the value to commonwealth governments of consultation with one another on foreign and economic affairs,defence and other matters of common concern. Although the exchange of informa-tion is fuller at the present time than it has ever been, it is. specially important that consultation should take place early while policy is still in the formativestages. The meeting recommend, subject to endorsement by the respective governments,; the following arrangements for Commonwealth consultation,which in part reflect existing practice : 1. Meetings of Commonwealth Prime Ministers will be held as often as is practicable.2. In the intervals between those meetings Commonwealth meetings onforeign affairs will be held at the Ministerial level at least once a year and twicea year if possible. These meetings will normally be held in one or other of theCommonwealth countries.  The first of these meetings will be held in Ceylon.3. Greater use will be made of facilities in London for consultation and theexchange of information. In addition to their contacts with the Secretary ofState for Commonwealth Relations and his staff- -(i) Commonwealth High Commissioners in London have direct access to theForeign Secretary. Meetings between the Foreign Secretary and individual High Commissioners will be held more frequently.Meetings between the Foreign Secretary and two or more high commissioners will also be arranged from time to time, as occasionrequires, for the. discussion of matters of common interest.(ii) Political Secretaries (or comparable officials) attached to the staffs of commonwealth High Commissioners in London also have direct access to the Foreign Office. Meetings between them and officials of theForeign Office, either individually or in groups, will be arranged as required.Other Commonwealth Governments will endeavour to make comparablearrangements in their capitals.4. (a) Commonwealth meetings on economic and financial- questions ofcommon concern will be held at the Ministerial level when required and practicable. These meetings will normally be held in one or other of the Common-wealth countries, according to circumstances. Where a particular problemdirectly concerns only some of the Commonwealth countries, the meeting mightbe confined to representatives of those countries.(6) For the discussion of matters affecting only two Commonwealth countriesmeetings of Ministers or officials will also be held as necessary; and, where appropriate, formal machinery could be established for this purpose on the linesof the recently constituted Continuing Canada-United-Kingdom EconomicCommittee.(c) The existing contacts between officials of Commonwealth Governmentsconcerned with financial and economic matters will be maintained and extended,and, in particular, there will be more frequent interchange of visits.5. (a) To meet present needs the existing Commonwealth Liaison Committeefor the European Recovery Programme, which includes officials of all Common-wealth countries, will, under the title &quot; Commonwealth Economic Information36187
Committee&quot; serve in London as a clearing-house for economic informationgenerally to provide the basis for informed consultation between Governments.(6) Other Commonwealth Governments will endeavour to make comparablearrangements in their capitals.6. In furtherance of the general aim of co-operation between all peace-lovingnations to deter and to resist aggression, there will be close consultation between commonwealth Governments to arrange co-operative action in matters of defence,including those matters which arise from a common interest in the security of aparticular region. The military advisers of those Governments will consult together to frame proposals and plans for submission to their respective governments.Meetings will be arranged on the Ministerial level, as the occasion demands,to discuss defence problems, whether general or regional.In the system of Commonwealth Service Liaison Officers there already existsmachinery for the exchange of military information of general interest, and commonwealth Governments will consider how that machinery can be improvedto render it fully effective as a means of exchanging information about the progressof the defence plans, whether general or regional, and securing the maximumappropriate degree of defence co-ordination... 7. The arrangements summarised above will supplement but will not super-sede the existing channels of communication between Commonwealth Governments.In London the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations will continue tobe responsible for relations with other Commonwealth Governments.
