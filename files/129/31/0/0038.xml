THIS  DOCUMENT IS   THE PROPERTY OF HIS   BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  December 1948SECRET Copy No. 61CP. (48) 30829th December, 1948CABINETTHE NATIONAL HEALTH service memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland i have seen the Minister of Health&apos;s memorandum (CP. (48) 302) on theprogress of the National Health Service and I am in general agreement withhis impressions and conclusions! This report includes comparable information on the position in Scotland.2. In Scotland, as in England, the new administrative organisation hasbeen brought into being with remarkable smoothness. On the latest information have, 94 per cent, of the population were on the doctors&apos; lists at the endof October. Almost all the general practitioners, some 98 per cent., were taking part in the Service and it is only in some of the cities that there are still afew doctors engaged entirely in private practice. Nearly all the 1,200 dentistsin general practice in Scotland have joined the Service; nearly all the 1,800chemists and 800 opticians are taking part. During the first four months ofthe new Service 10 per cent, of the population (about 500,000 persons) receiveddental treatment and 5 per cent (250,000 persons) received glasses/ All the hospitals in Scotland of any consequence, with the exception of three roman catholic mental deficiency institutions and a Red Cross Sanatorium, have beentaken over 425 in all with 62,000 beds.3. I have had no difficulty in finding members for the Regional hospital boards, Hospital Boards of Management and Executive Councils and I am greatly impressed by the time and energy these people have devoted to getting the new service going and the quality of their administration and policy making. TheService in Scotland owes a great deal to the willing co-operation I have had from those concerned in the field and particularly from the former managers ofthe voluntary hospitals. The general atmosphere in which discussions have been and are being conducted is good.4. I have had the same difficulties as the Minister of Health in connectionwith the remuneration of dentists and its effect on the school dental service. Iwas in whole-hearted agreement with the proposal to modify the dentists&apos;remuneration by regulation. In Scotland we have lost something like 15 per cent,of the school dentists. The tendency to drift away had asserted itself before5th July as there was already a disparity between the incomes of private dentistsand the salaries which local authorities were willing to pay. The high remunera-tion obtained by dentists has also, I think, repercussions on the other health service personnel, especially the doctors who think that their remuneration is too low.5. While I do not myself believe that this is so, generally, the capitationrate does produce a relatively low remuneration in the smaller practices, that is,mainly, in the rural areas. The drop in income compared with the incomesobtained from these practices before 5th July may not be wholly removed bythe mileage allowances and inducement payments. The doctors&apos; position will,I think, need further examination and there may be a real grievance as wellas the relative -grievance arising from, comparison with the present positionof the dentists.36335
6. The Scottish chemists have not accepted the rates of payment which theywere offered. They agreed to serve only on the understanding that they wouldbe free to submit a comprehensive claim for higher rates at a later date, throughthe Whitley procedure.&quot;   They are now engaged in its preparation.7. One would not expect Scots to be slow in taking advantage of the freeservices provided but in considering the present very large demand I think wehave to remember, first, that a good many people postponed the purchase ofspectacles, dentures or other appliances until after 5th July and, secondly, thatwe are nov- meeting, often once and for all, genuine needs which people were unable to afford before. For example, we have had one-legged patients comingfor an artificial leg who have never had one before. We have sometimes hadthe tragedy that it is now too late to fit limbs and all we can do is to supply them with wheeled chairs. I am sure that for many appliances we are nowfacing the peak of the demand but, whether that is so or not, the very magnitude of the demand is significant of the need for the new Service and of the gapsthat formerly existed. There are, of course, abuses which it will take time andpossibly some tightening up to eliminate, but in relation to the whole they arevery small.8. There is one serious practical difficulty already evident. The regional boards and the Executive Councils can obtain premises, whether for hospitalpurposes, doctors&apos; houses or administrative offices, only at a price fixed on thebasis of compulsory purchase under the Town and Country Planning Act. TheDistrict Valuer&apos;s figure for this purpose is nearly always far below market value and these bodies, consisting as they do of local residents who serve on a voluntary basis, are very reluctant to recommend the exercising of compulsory powers wherethey think that hardship to an individual will be caused. The Regional Boards,in particular, have emphasised that they must have the goodwill of the communitygenerally and that they cannot afford to antagonise the local people by exercisingcompulsory powers. The practical result is to prevent the acquisition of premisesfor the purposes of the health services in all but the exceptional case and I amseriously concerned about the effect of this on new developments. In the absenceof any relaxation we may have to proceed almost entirely by new building.9. The estimated cost to the Exchequer of the Service in Scotland is approximately as follows : 	5th July, 1948,	Financial	to 31st March, 1949	year	(nine months)	1949-1950	  million	  millionHospitals and Specialists ...	15-5	25-3Doctors (General Practitioners)   ...	4 0	5-3Dentists	2-3	4-0Chemists	1-5	2-0Ophthalmic Services	1-5	2-local Authority Services ...	1-0	11Miscellaneous (Executive Council Adminis-		tration, Superannuation, &amp;c.)	1-2	1-9Gross Charge against Exchequer ...	27-0	41-9Appropriations in Aid (Contribution from		National Insurance Fund Charges, &amp;c.)	6-0	7-4Net Charge against Exchequer   ...	21-0	34-5The figure for 1949-50 Works out at 2s. 8d. per head of the population per week.10. A rough estimate of what was spent in Scotland before 5th July onthe kind of things that are now provided in the National Health Service is 25 million. The gap between the costs of the old services and the new seemsto be slightly greater in Scotland than in England but this is what I would expect. There is no doubt that the levels of remuneration which account for so much of the total expenditure tended in Scotland to be lower for all classesof worker in the Health Service than they were in England and Wales. I have thought it right in a National Service for which everyone is paying and to the
benefits of which everyone is equally entitled that the same services should carry the same rates of remuneration throughout the United Kingdom and the adoptionof this principle is an essential condition of the working of the new Whitleyprocedure on a United Kingdom basis.11. I am impressed by the extent to which the total expenditure on theNational Health Service is governed by the levels of remuneration for the health service personnel and it seems to me, therefore, important that the Health Depart-ments should devote particular care and attention to the negotiations which takeplace under the new Whitley procedure so as to avoid excessive expenditure.12. It is too early perhaps to make any general assessment of the positiveachievements of the new Service, as distinct from the undoubted success wehave had in putting it effectively into operation, but it would be easy to under-estimate the benefits to the ordinary man and woman of having ready access toall these services and the relief which many of the professional people feel atthe removal of financial considerations in deciding on the treatment of theirpatients. And, in the hospital services, there is already definite evidence thatthe new regional organisation will bring the most highly skilled resources to the help of the individual patient, especially in the smaller towns and villages, ina way that they have never and could not have been brought before. I quotefor what it is worth a passage from a recent report from a Regional HospitalBoard  &quot; The impression has been gained that there is a quiet but genuinesatisfaction on the part of the general public that the hospital and specialistservice is now more freely available to all, irrespective of social position.There is already evidence of the wisdom of vesting in one body the generaloversight of the hospitals in the Region in the fact that the Regional Office,with its knowledge of the hospital resources of the Region, has been instru-mental in arranging the appropriate hospitalisation of many cases whoseadmission to hospital in other circumstances would have involved considerable delay and difficulty.&quot;A.
