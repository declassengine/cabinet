(48) 2977th December, 1948CABINET31CURRENCY SITUATION IN BERLINMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs since my memorandum CP. (48) 285 was circulated on 29th November,there have been the following further developments :  (a) The British Military Governor has, in accordance with his instructions(see recommendation VII (&amp;) of CP. (48) 285), tried to reach agreement withhis United States and French colleagues on the actual plan to be put into effectwhen a decision to do so has been taken. He argued in favour of Course (D)on page 4 of my earlier memorandum. General Clay was, however, still infavour of a plan which would make the currency of the Western sectors identical with that of the Western Zones (Course (C)). General Koenig had no instruc-tions and was unable to discuss the matter. The three Military Governors did,however, agree that, as soon as they were authorised by their Governments todiscuss the question of the introduction of the Western mark into Berlin with german technical experts, they should discuss it with representatives of thepolitical parties in Berlin in order to obtain their reactions to Course (D). Wemay expect the Germans to prefer Course (C). The effect of this procedurewill be that the Military Governors will be largely committed by the opinionswhich the Germans may express.(b) The Soviet Government have taken a number of steps in Berlin whichhave effectively split the City Administraiioa-4nto two parts. In particular they have set up in the Soviet sector a (s^ooge..-Magistra.t which claims to bethe Government of Berlin. These steps have been reported in detail to theCommittee of Experts set up under the Security Council in Paris which isexamining the problem of the currency of Berlin. This Committee will also have to take into account an official Tass communique on the currency questiongiving Russian comments on the various documents circulated to the SecurityCouncils Committee. These comments, on the surface, seem to indicate someadvance towards Russian acceptance of the idea of Four-Power control of berlin&apos;s currency on the lines for which we have been pressing, and might havebeen regarded as a useful working basis if they had been put forward duringthe Berlin discussions at the beginning of September. It may be, indeed, thatthey will assist the Expert Committee to find common ground between the eastern and Western desiderata: but the fact that they have been put forward at this juncture suggests that they may mainly be designed to prolong discussionaird&quot;lleiay separate action by the Western Powers in Berlin.(c) Elections have been held in the Western sectors of Berlin and have resulted in a large poll in which the S.P.D. has secured a very substantial victory.We shall now have to decide whether to set up a separate magistrate for thethree Western sectors. We must expect the Germans to press for this; and itwould be very difficult to refuse.36256
(d) The Minister of State has reported from Paris that Mr. Marshall hassent me a personal message, stating that he is anxious to take an immediate decision in agreement with His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Gpvern-ment as to the currency to be used in the Western sectors of Berlin. Mr. Marshallsuggested that the British and United States Ambassadors in Paris mighttogether see M, Schuman at once upon this subject. I have replied to this messageby saying that I could not join in any such approach until the matter had beenconsidered by the Cabinet, but that if the United States Ambassador were tosee M. Schuman on his own and to find out the views of the French Government,I should have no objection.2 In these circumstances I think that the time has now come to decide whether we should go ahead with the introduction of the Western mark as solecurrency into the Western sectors of Berlin, and, if we decide to do this, uponthe best method and the timing for this step.3. After careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that in spiteof the undesirability of taking any step which might make it more difficult forthe Committee of Experts to reach a satisfactory agreement, we should decidenow to take the necessary preparatory measures for the introduction of theWestern mark into the Western sectors of Berlin.4. The arguments for and against this course are set out in my earlier memorandum (C.P. (48) 285). I have reached this conclusion principally on theground that any further delay in taking this step might have serious financialand political consequences in the Western sectors of the city. The results of theelections show that the morale of the Berliners is still high, but with the colderweather approaching and with the present financial position steadily deterioratingI think that unless we act soon we may seriously discourage the Berlin population,and all the efforts which we have made and are still making to hold the position may prove to have been in vain.5. I realise that if the Western mark is introduced as sole currency intothe Western sectors we may be criticised for having done something to jeopardiseFour-Power agreement on a unified currency. It is also possible that theRussians will take reprisals in the form of cutting off gas and water suppliesso far as they are able and of interfering with Berlin metropolitan railway(the S-bahn). (Electricity is already very largely cut off.) Undesirable though these consequences may be, I think we must face them. The Russians are not likely to be deterred from taking unpleasant action of this sort merely because we refrain from reforming the currency in the Western sectors. Indeed, theymay well hope that we will allow the financial situation to become so bad thatour position in Berlin will be undermined under our eyes. It would thereforebe best to take steps to see that when the time comes later on to negotiate withthe Soviet Government about Berlin as a whole we shall be in as strong apolitical and financial position in the Western sectors as is possible in presentcircumstances.6. I therefore recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Government should now reach agreement with the United States and French Governments to introduce a western mark on a 100 per cent, basis in. the most suitable manner and at themost suitable time into the Western Sectors of Berlin.7. As regards the timing and the method, I recommend that instructions should now be sent to the British Military Governor to work out with his colleagues the best plan they can devise for this purpose. In view of the action which theRussians have taken in Berlin, I do not think we need trouble too much abouttrying to obtain Course (D) as opposed to Course (C). Both courses have theiradvantages and disadvantages and I am prepared to leave it to the British military governor to agree with his colleagues on what seems to them to be the best course in the present circumstances, taking into account German opinion both technical and political.8. I further recommend that the Military Governors should be authorisedto consult responsible German opinion secretly at a moment to be chosen by them-selves, and to draft all necessary legislation so that when the date for the currencychange is settled, action can be taken without delay. When the plan is ready-and it will take two or three weeks at least to prepare-it would be desirable toput it into effect at once unless by that time there was good prospect of the early
application of the Four-Power agreement reached in Paris. By the time, theMilitary Governors&apos; plan is ready, that is, about, the end of the year, the pro-ceedings of the Committee of Experts in Paris will have reached their 30-da^term and the situation there should be clear.     : ,t9.   If my colleagues agree with these recommendations, steps will have to beaken at the appropriate time to explain to the President of the Security Council;and to public opinion at large our reasons for taking this action, and to make clear to them that our action is fully justified for the defence of our legitimaterights in Berlin and is in no way designed to aggravate the situation.   : - i MForeign Office, S. W. 1,7th December, 1948.
