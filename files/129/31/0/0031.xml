TH1S DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1948SECRET - CopjfcNo.CP. (48) 30113KA December, 1948CABINETGERMANY-OCCUPATION STATUTEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsPresent Position and recommendations i am circulating to my colleagues at Annex A the latest draft of an occupation Statute for Western Germany. This draft has been under discussionfor some time by the three Western Military Governors, who have reached agree-ment at their level except on about five or six points. The draft which I am nowcirculating is not in final form. It will be considered once more on 16th-l7thDecember by the Military Governors and the drafting is at present being revised in Germany by Allied legal experts. Thereafter the draft, as so revised, andwith any disagreed points clearly indicated, will be submitted to the three Govern-ments for their approval, and for them to settle the disagreed points by direct negotiation. My colleagues will at that stage have an opportunity to see the revised draft.2.   On this basis I wish to make the following interim recommendations :--(1) That the general principles embodied in, but not the detailed drafting of,the present draft be approved;(2) that intergovernmental talks be started as soon as possible (preferablyon 20th December to settle any points which may still be in disputeafter the Military Governors have completed their discussions;(3) that I be given authority to agree interdepartmentally with those ofmy colleagues who are particularly concerned on the instructions tobe given to our representatives on the points to be discussed at theintergovernmental talks.Previous History3. Last June my colleagues approved a Letter of Advice to the military governors setting out the broad principles for an Occupation Statute, as agreed at the Six-Power Conference in London (CP. (48) 143: Annex I). These principleswere as follows : &quot; The Governments of the three Occupying Powers recognise that theestablishment of a constitutional German Government will necessitate a definition of the relationship between this Government and the Alliedauthorities. The Military Governors will accordingly grant legislativeexecutive and judicial power to German Governments and reserve to them-selves such powers as are necessary to ensure the fulfilment of the basicpurpose of the occupation. Such powers are those necessary to enable theMilitary Governors to : &quot;(a) &quot;Conduct or direct Germany&apos;s foreign relations until such time as she may be permitted unrestricted foreign relations;(b) &apos;&apos; exercise the minimum control over German foreign trade, and overinternal policies and measures which could adversely affect foreign trade, necessary to ensure respect by the German authorities forobligations entered into by the Occupying Powers in regard toGermany and the proper use of funds made available to Germany;(c) &quot; exercise such controls as have been or may be agreed upon, as forexample, regarding the international authority for the Ruhr,reparations, the level of industry, decartelisation, disarmament and demilitarisation and certain aspects of scientific research;36276 - B
(d) &apos;&apos; protect the prestige and ensure the security of the occupation forces and the satisfaction of their requirements within defined limitsagreed upon between the Military Governors;-     (e) &quot; ensure the observance of the Constitution which they have approved.&quot;Purpose and Effect4. Once these principles have been put into effect our position in germany will be considerably changed, both in theory and in practice. Though in certainfields we shall retain full authority (e.g., the military side, the control of the Ruhr:and to a lesser degree Germany&apos;s foreign relations and foreign trade), never-theless, except in the reserved subjects, machinery of Government in Germany willhenceforth be very largely in German hands and subject to the direct authorityof a German Government; German legislation in the permitted field will comeinto force automatically unless disapproved within twenty-one days by the Mili-tary Governors (probably acting by a majority); several branches of administra-tion in which we have hitherto taken part in day-to-day management (e.g., educa-tion and internal public safety) will no longer be our direct concern, and so far aswe retain our own officials in these branches, they will act in an advisory capacity.5. This does not mean that we shall have no control over Germany, but that instead of having close control, we shall have remote control. Our most effectiveimmediate sanction will reside in our continued power to control imports of food and raw materials. In the last resort there will be the possible resumption by proclamation of the full powers of the Military Governors, which we shall Con-tinue to possess, but not normally to exercise.6. We must expect that this increased liberty of action enjoyed by a newly-established Western German Government will at times be a cause of embarrass-ment to us. Whether from inexperience, or out of mere arrogance, they will cer-tainly sometimes act unwisely, in matters of politics, economics or social policy.This possibility must be recognised as part of the process of building up demo-cratic political institutions in Germany to which we are committed.Recent Developments7. Since last June we, together with our French and American Allies, havebeen drafting an Occupation Statute on the above lines. As my colleagues will see, from the latest draft of the Occupation Statute which is attached at annex &quot;A,&quot; there still exist disagreements on a number of points. Thesedisagreements are unlikely to be settled between the Military Governors, and it istherefore most probable that they, or some of them., will have to be resolved byintergovernmental discussion. I attach at Annex &quot; B &quot; a short note on the moreimportant of them.8. Parallel with the negotiations between the Military Governors on theOccupation Statute, the Germans have been working at Bonn on a draft basic law (provisional Constitution), which will have to be approved by the military governors before it can come into effect. The Military Governors have beenkeeping in touch with the discussions among the Germans through liaison officers,but there may well be points which will also require discussion among the AlliedGovernments after the Germans have completed their labours.9. It will be necessary for the Occupation Statute to be dovetailed into the basic Law, and the Germans, who on the whole have got on well at Bonn, have for some time been complaining that they cannot finish their work on the basic law until they know what is going to be in the Occupation Statute. The germans have now formulated a request through Dr. Adenauer, who is the President of theParliamentary Council, to be allowed to see the Occupation Statute.10. The three Military Governors are therefore meeting representatives ofthe Parliamentary Council on 16th December to discuss progress on the Basic Lawand the Occupation Statute. They will make it clear that the draft has still beenunder discussion by the Military Governors only and that the three governments have not yet considered it in detail. The Military Governors will not, of course,be able to make, any definite statement to the Germans on those points whereagreement has not been reached between the Western Allies.11. Now that the Military Governors have gone almost as far as they can intheir work on the Occupation Statute, and that the time is rapidly approachingwhen this Statute will have to be dovetailed into the Basic Law, it is very important that intergovernmental talks should be held as soon as possible to settle the dis-agreed. points in the Statute referred to above.   The French have also asked that
an intergovernmental meeting should be held shortly in Paris for this purpose.The views of the United States Government are now being sought, but there is little doubt that their approval will be forthcoming.12. I will circulate to my colleagues for their approval the final version ofthe Occupation Statute after the intergovernmental talks have been held and before any complete text is handed over to the Germans.E.

The Occupation Authorities will resume the exercise of their full powers in an emergency threatening security, and if necessary to secure compliance withthe Federal constitution and the constitutions of the participating Lander or withthis statute. Before exercising these powers the Military Governors will formallyadvise the responsible German authorities of their decision and of the reason for it.19. The Occupation Authorities will have a special responsibility to observe,advise and assist the Federal State and the participating Lander in regard tothe democratisation of political life, social relations and education of the Germanpeople. This shall not imply any restrictions of the legislative executive andjudicial competence accorded to them in those matters. The Federal State and the participating Lander will furnish any special information, facilities and statistics which may be .requested by the Occupation Authorities ill the exerciseof this responsibility. Legislation in those fields shall be subject, to the provisionsof paragraph 3 of this Statute.Article VIIRequirements of the Occupation20. [The powers of the Occupation Authorities under Article II includethe power to require the Federal State to make such financial or other provis-ions and the participating Lander to make such provisions other than financialas in the opinion of the Military Governors may be necessary for the dischargeof the responsibilities thereby reserved to them. The Federal State and the participating Lander will be consulted regarding the procedure by which such requirements are to be satisfied] (United States/ United Kingdom).[In applying the provisions of Article II, the Military Governors may, afterconsultation with them, require the competent German authorities to make suchfinancial or other provision as they deem necessary for the discharge of the responsibilities placed upon them by this Statute] (France).21. [In respect both of the requirements of the Occupation Forces(Occupation Costs) and of the other provisions required to be made under thepreceding paragraph (Mandatory Expenditures), the Occupation Authoritiesshall, after consultation with Federal States authorities, establish in advance anannual budget estimate. This estimate will be communicated to the federal government and will not be exceeded except in accordance with a supple-mentary estimate similarly established and , communicated to the federal government. In principle, such supplementary estimates will not be presented in respect of Occupation Costs, except for such specific reasons as majorimperfections in the original estimate, changes in the functions, size, or redeploy-ment of the Occupation Forces, or increases in prices and wages. The Occupa-tion Authorities will require that all costs arising under this Article shall beborne upon the Federal State budget] (United States/ United Kingdom).[A budget estimate of the Occupation Costs and other imposed expenditurereferred to in the preceding paragraph shall.be notified annually to the competentGerman authorities to whom an estimate will be communicated in advance.Additional credits shall only be imposed during the financial year if the original estimates contained major imperfections or if changes occurred in the functionor size or deployment of the Occupation Forces or in prices or wages in Germany.21 (bis). The competent Federal organisation shall establish an equitableplan of apportionment between the Lander of the Occupation Costs notified inaccordance with paragraph 21 above and shall supervise its execution. It shallensure, in particular, that those Lander which have been required to pay sumsin excess of the contribution assessed by the plan of apportionment shall be reimbursed within the terms of the plan] (France).
Article  VIIIInterpretation of the Statute&apos; 22. Any German Government on its own behalf, or on behalf of anyone ofits citizens, may appeal from any action taken by the Occupation Authorities onthe ground that the action is in conflict with the provisions of this Statute. Suchappeals will be addressed to the appropriate Occupation Authorities accordingto such procedure as will be established with ultimate appeal to a [High Court](United States/United Kingdom) [Judicial Court] (France). However, noappeal hereunder will have the effect of suspending the action taken.23. The [High Court] (United States/United Kingdom) [Judicial Council](France) will be constituted as follows : two jurists, appointed by each of theMilitary Governors, [one German jurist appointed by the Federal Governmentand one neutral jurist appointed by the President of the International Court ofJustice] (United States/United Kingdom). [Its decisions will be binding on theparties] (United States/ United Kingdom). [It will be within the power of theMilitary Governors to transform the conclusions of this organ into decisions.The Judicial Council will give its ruling within two months on the basis of the written evidence submitted to it] (France).i .:    Note. (The United Kingdom delegation reserves its position on the questionof the composition of the Court.)\; . ; article  IXn ;:;lv ; Amendments to the Statute24. The Military Governors will examine periodically the possibility ofi revising the Occupation Statute with the view of extending the jurisdiction of. the German authorities in the legislative, executive and judicial fields.   Noamendments to the Statute shall be made without prior notice to, and consulta-tion with, the Federal and Land Governments concerned.i ; ii, 1st December, 1948..&quot;r - : ANNEX &quot; B &quot;.!..-: Main points of Disagreement between the three Military Governors1. Occupation Costs (paragraph 20 and 21 of draft)The question at issue is whether these costs, which are substantial, shouldbe borne on the budgets of the eleven Lander Governments in the Western Zonesor on the budget of the Western German Government when this is set up. TheFrench are in favour of the former plan; we and the Americans of the lattervTdie underlying cause of this disagreement is the French dislike of the federal government of Germany having substantial powers of taxation/particularly inthis case where there is an analogy between Occupation Costs and an eventualappropriation for defence purposes in Germany. This difference of opinion maybe difficult to resolve.2.   Interpretation of the Statute (paragraphs 22 and 23 of the draft)The issue is the nature and composition of the body which will decide inter-interpretations of the Statute which are disputed between the Occupying Powers andi,the Germans. We and the Americans are in favour of a High Court whose-decisions will be binding on the parties and whose members shall comprise neutraland German members.   The French want a judicial Council composed solely of legal.members of the Occupying Powers, and with power to give rulings which onlybecome enforceable by a decision of the Military Governors.&apos;;3&apos;.&quot; Jkrisdictional Powers over Allied Nationals in civil cases and over displaced...: V persons in both civil and criminal cases (paragraphs 13 and 14 of the draft)i . Broadly the issue here is between the Americans and the French on the onehand,&apos; who wish to exclude these categories from the jurisdiction of the German-CourtSj and ourselves on the other, who are in favour with certain safeguards of admitting the competence of German Courts. This is probably a point upon which;we could afford to give way for-the sake of reaching complete agreement on theStatute as a whole. ; .&apos;.- &apos;  .
