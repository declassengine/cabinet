&quot; 1^3(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C       secret.P.(h8)  292UTH DECEMBER,  19h8CABINETLICENSING bill memorandum bv the Home Secreta-pv1. The Cabinet on 2nd December,  191+8 (C.M.(h8) 77thConclusions, Minute 2)  asked the Lord President&apos;s Committee toexamine Clause 19 of the Licensing Bill,  relating to the saleof alcoholic drinks in night clubs.2. Undei&quot; the existing licensing lav/, alcoholic drinks maynot be sold in licensed houses or registered clubs after thelatest permitted hour which in Central London is 11 p.m.;    but,with the approval of the licensing just-ices, licensed premises and registered clubs may serve drinks with meals until 12 mid-night,  and an extra half-hour is allowed for consuming drinks.Licensed premises and registered clubs may obtain an extension of hours on a special occasion:      and in central London two of thelarge hotels have special extensions once a week.3* The bottle party has arisen in Central London duringthe last twenty years by exploiting a gap in the licensing laws.A bottle party professes not to sell drink at all and the theoryis that the members of the party bring with them their own drink,or have them ordered and paid for during permitted hours anddelivered to the premises of the bottle party.      There are atpresent fifteen bottle parties operating in the West End of London.k. During the war Defence Regulation h2C was made, underwhich a Chief Officer of Police could close undesircble nightresorts.      Seventy-three orders under this Defence Regulation havebeen made in respect of bottle parties by the Commissioner of Policeof the Metropolis, including three in the present- year,  and in no case has his decision been upset on appeal.      The Regulation is,however, due to come to an end on 10t-h December,  1950.5. At the Lord President&apos;s Committee on 3rd December(L.P, (I4.8)  18th Meeting, Minute 2) further consideration was givento  the proposal contained in Clause 19 of the Licensing Bill   whichprohibits,  after the latest permitted hour,  the supply orconsumption of intoxicating liquor at any party which is organisedfor gain and takes place in premises habitually used for parties soorganised at which intoxicating liquor is consumed.6. As indicated above,   these bottle parties,  although notillegal, are an evasion of the spirit of the licensing lows.Moreover,  it is inequitable that respectable licensed premises suchas hotels are not allowed to serve drink at dances after midnight,whereas those bottle parties which pay no licence duties ormonopoly value serve drink   night after night up to the early hoursof the morning.COPY NO.-1-
7* At the Lord President&apos;s Committee     attention was called to the effect on the tourist trade if bottle parties in Londonwere closed down end some members of the Committee urged that,instead of prohibiting drink at such parties after the permittedhours,  there should be a provision on the lines of the defence regulation empowering the police to close undesirableparties.It was agreed that this suggestion should be further considered by the Lord Chancellor and myself in consultation.8.       -       Further consideration has satisfied the Lord Chancellorend myself that it is not possible or desirable to replace theprovisions of the Bill by a scheme on the lines of the defence regulation.     Apart from the political object-ion to such avolte face it would have to be explained that the object of suchan amendment of the Bill was to preserve the existing position under which bottle parties are in a privileged position.9. The Lord Chancellor and I think therefore- that the Billmust remain as drafted.10. The only remaining question is whether some further provision should be included in the Bill to enable licensed premises and registered clubs,  in areas such as central London,to sell drink after the permitted hours in premises wheredancing takes place.      This would be an extension of the existing law which allows drink to be sold after permitted hours on specialoccasions.      Such a proposal is open to criticism on the groundthat it provides further facilities for drinking.     On the otherhand,  if any concession is to be made for the purpose of attractingtourists,,  this is the only scheme which seems feasible^J * G a  j tHome Office, S.W.1.h-th December,  19h8
