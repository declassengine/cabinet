/secret .P.W) 30013TH DECEMBER, 1 9hSCABINETRF.PORT OF THE ARMY AND AIR FORGE0QURTS-MARTIAL COMMITTEE ,  19UbMemorandum by the Lord chancellor.     The Cabinet will remember that I brought, certain interimrecommendations of Mr. Justice Lewis&apos;s Committee on Army andAii? Force Courts-Martial, relating to the position and functions of the Judge Advocate General of the Forces, totheir notice in December, 19h7, (C.p.(h7) 336).    In January 191+8approval was given in principle to the Judge Advocate general with his judicial department being transferred to me, andhis prosecuting departments absorbed within the War Officeand   Air Ministry respectively (CM.(h8) 5th Conclusions,Minute 3).    These changes have since been put into force,with effect from 1st October last.2.     The full report, of the Lewis Committee, incorporatingthese interim recommendations, was received in April 19U8.Its main recommendations are of a highly important and far-reaching character, which will attract a good deal ofpublic attention, and may arouse considerable controversy incertain particulars.We are committed by statements made from time to time in both Houses to publish the report as soon as we are in aposition to announce the Government1s intentions in regardto it, and we shall undoubtedly be pressed to give effectto the main recommendations in the Army and Air Force (Annual)Bill, 19h9.    I am, therefore, by agreement with the other ministers concerned, now submitting certain important questions,arising out of the report, which appear to us to call for cabinet consideration and decision, with our recommendationsthereon.3*     When the report was first received, the Secretaries ofState and I agreed to remit it in the first instance to an interdepartmental Committee under the Chairmanship of myPermanent Secretary for examination in detail.    The reportof the latter Committee was received in October, surd has since been considered by the Army and Air Councils,    andsubsequently by the Ministers concerned, I.e. the woSecretaries of State and myself,  and the Minister of defence and the First Lord of the Admiralty (in view of the likelyrepercussions of the report on the Navy).    Copies of the twoCommittee reports are circulated herewith, and it will be seenthat in substance the Napier Committee recommend acceptanceof the Lev/Is Committee recommendations, with variousmodifications and a few important exceptions.COPY NO.S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)
U*     It is not necessary to trouble the Cabinet with recommendations of minor importance or matters of detail whichare chiefly of interest to the Service Departments.   the major matters calling for consideration are set out inparagraph 3 of the Napier report, and I would direct attentionparticularly to that paragraph and to the commentsfollowing in paragraphs 5 to 8 of that report.5.     The existing Court-Martial system in the Army andAir Force is, briefly, that the accused is tried by a Courtentirely composed of Service officers, assisted and advisedin more serious cases by a &quot;judge advocate&quot;, representingthe Judge Advocate General, who is not a member of the Court,and who, having summed up, does not retire with the court to consider the finding or have any vote on the sentence.The proceedings are not complete until they have been confirmed by a duly authorised officer, who may seek legal advice from the Judge Advocate General, o:1 one of hisofficers, before confirming.   All proceed&apos;, gs aresubsequently reviewed   by the Judge Advocate General inLondon, to ensure that no irregularity or miscarriage ofjustice has occurred.    Should he find any, he would soadvise the Secretary of State, who has power to quash theproceedings.   There is no right of appeal to a higher court,but any officer or soldier convicted, can, assisted if he wishes by his legal adviser, submit any number of writtenpetitions against the finding or the sentence, or both, to anyco nfinning or reviewing authority, including His Majesty.6.     This system has frequently been criticised on theground that it leaves the decision entirely in the hands ofthe Service authorities and that there is no right of appealto a higher court, similar to that open to a civilian underthe Criminal Appeal Act, 1907.   Two previous committees which have reviewed the Court-Martial system - the Darling  .Committee of 1919 and the Oliver Committee of 1938 -came to the conclusion that the existing system providedmore effective safeguards for the soldier and airmanthan are enjoyed by a civilian, and advised against settingup a Court of Appeal.    The Lev/is Committee has reached adifferent conclusion, mainly on the ground that it isimportant not only that justice should be done, but that itshould manifestly be seen to be done, and recommends the setting up of a Courts-Martial Appeal Court, presided over bya Chief Judge Martial (replacing the Judge Advoco.te General)with the status and remuneration-of a puisne Judge of theHigh Court of Justice, to hear appeals on points of lav/initiated by the accused.    The change would involve theabolition of the present system of confirmation and review and the withdrawal of the present power of quashingconvictions from all authorities at present possessing it,including His Majesty, and its vesting solely in the Courts-Martial Appeal Court.    There: would be provision for a furtherappeal, on a point of law of exceptional public importance,to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on the attorney General&apos;s certificate.7.     The arguments for a Court of Appeal are set out inparagraphs 13h to 151 of the Lewis Committee report, withwhich should be read the comments in paragraphs 5 and of the Napier report.   The Secretaries of State for Warand Air and I agree with the conclusion of the NapierCommittee that, while it is very doubtful whether the soldier or airman will in fact benefit from the change, and
while a certain number of convictions which would be quashedunder the present system of automatic review are likely to stand under the new system, either because the man fails to appeal or because a technical irregularity which might havegiven ground for quashing may not afford sufficient&apos;ground forappeal, on balance the finding of the Lewis Committee shouldbe accepted, with certain provisos.    These are (1) that theCourt should have power to hear not only appeals strictlyinvolving points of law but appeals involving fact or mixed lawand fact similar to the powers of the Court of Criminal Appeal,-(2) that an appeal should be admissible where a plea of guiltyhas been accepted by mistake by a lay Court-Martial,  (3)  that power should be taken to suspend the right of oral appeal ifnecessary in emergency (i.o. in wartime)  and replace it by asystem of review by the Chief Judge Martial1s Department ona written petition by the accused.    This last proviso isnecessary to avoid the risk of a break-down of the appeal system in war.8.     A decision on those lines may meet with some criticism from some Service members who know the existing system from within and take the same view as the Darling and Oliver Committees took inthe past, but wo should expect the two Houses as a whole to endorse the proposal of the Lewis Committee to set up anindependent Court of Appeal,   Tho main difficulty is likely tocome from pressure to extent the Court to deal with appeals from naval Courts-Martial, and from this angle we have discussed the matter with the Minister of Defence and the First Lord ofthe Admiralty, upon whom it will chiefly fall to meet this pressure.    It should be explained that naval courts martial wereoutside the scope of the Lewis Committee.    After the intentionto set up the Committee for the Army and Air Force had been announced, the. question of including the Navy was raised, butthe First Lord was against joining them in the enquiry, as therehad been little or no criticism of naval disciplinary procedure,and the constitution of the Committee was. in any case not entirely suitable for a naval enquiry.   He was prepared toundertake that careful consideration would be given to any recommendations of the Lewis Committee which might affect theadministration of justice in the Navy, and did not rule out,though he hoped to avoid, inviting the same Committee, with thesubstitution of Naval for Arm;/ and Air Force members, to pass onto the subject of naval disciplinary procedure.   The First Lordhas considered the recommendations of tho Lewis Committee andis opposed to any proposal to extend the present recommendation to them, at any rate at this stage, for tho following main reasons:-(1)    He considers that justice is more likely to be done under the existing system.(2)    No civil court can deal adequately with manypeculiarly naval cases - e.g. neglect of duty andnegligently hazarding or stranding ship - whichare at present dealt with on review by the Boardof Admiralty, with their long experience and knowledge of naval tradition.(3)   Ho doubts the desirability of introducing a rightof oral appeal which in the Navy would almost certainly have to be suspended in emergency.(h)    The Admiralty are committed to discussing with new Zealand and Australia any proposed alterations of the Naval Court-Martial system or the naval discipline Act.
It will obviously be very difficult to persuade either house of Parliament in this matter of a right of appeal that what is right for the soldier and airman is not right for thesailor, but I think it is reasonable to say that the naval service and its system of discipline are different in many waysfrom the Army and Air Force and their systems,  that the case ofthe Navy has not yet been considered, and that it is desirableto have the views either of the Lewis Committee,  reconstitutedwith naval membership,  or of another Committee of equalauthority, before deciding to what extent the reforms recommended for the Array and Air Force should be applied to the Navy.      Ihave therefore agreed with the First Lord and the Minister ofDefence that arrangements for such an enquiry should be put inhand at once, and I think that this, together with the need to consult the Dominions, will be a sufficient answer to criticsfor the time being.9* The status and remuneration of the Chief judge martial have been the subject of discussion between my department and the Treasury.      The terms of appointment agreed between thetwo Departments are set out in the Annex to this memorandum.The chief point on which they differ from the Lewis Committeeis that the salary proposed is  3.000 to  3.500 instead of 5,000 per annum.      I hope that  3.500, at any rate, will besufficient to enable me to find a suitable man for the post,and that this salary,  together with the other terms of appointmentwill give the Chief Judge Martial sufficient status and inde-pendence.On the other hand,  I am bound to point out that the salary of  5,000 would give me a greater range and make it easier for me to get the very best man.    &quot;Moreover, it must berealised that the variation from the figure recommended by the lewis Committee will be controversial.      I do not propose thatthe amount should be fixed by statute, but it will no doubt benecessary to tell Parliament what the salary is to be.      It willbe argued that status depends to a large extent on salary,  andthat without the salary of a High Court Judge a^jfe Chief judge martial will not carry that weight with the officers of highrank that the men in the Forces desire and the Lewis committee recommended.10. The other main recommendations of the Lewis Committeeaffecting Courts-Martial are that a General Court-Martial and a district Court-Martial when trying more serious or difficultcases should have a civilian lawyer (Judge Martial, DeputyJudge Martial or Assistant Judge Martial as the case may be)as president, who would, broadly speaking,  act like a judge atan Assize Court in the case of a General Court-Martial and likethe chairman of a bench of magistrates in the case of a DistrictCourt-Martial.      We agree with the Napier Committee in accepting this recommendation, with the modification that in both cases the function should be that of a judge rather than chairman of abench of magistrates.      District Courts-Martial to try simplercases would be purely lay courts, with more restricted powers.In emergency, there would be Emergency Courts-Martial, similarto the present Field General Courts-Martial.
Here again the First Lord of&quot; the Admiralty is opposed to any attempt to apply the system of civilian presidentsto naval courts-martial.      Trials by court-martial in the Navyare so infrequent in time of peace that there would not be enough work for even a small corps of full-time civilian lawyersand it would be quite impossible to offer a satisfactory careerto suitably qualified men.      The appointment of civilian lawyersas presidents on an ad hoc basis would mean that the mostimportant member of the court had only a theoretical knowledge ofthe intricacies of naval law. -    This solution would, be quiteunacceptable.      The alternative of making into presidents thenaval officers who now act ss Officiating Deputy Judge Advocates(and who are being trained to qualify as lawyers) would not really meet the demand for civilian presidents and would cause serious difficulties in the Navy,  since the whole structure ofnaval discipline is built around the executive branch, to whichthese officers do not belong.      This problem, however, would nodoubt be one of the matters into which the new Committee wouldenqu ire.11. One other matter, which is likely to be very controversial,  arises out of the Lewis Committee&apos;s recommendation that all findings of Courts-Martial, whether for convictionor acquittal,  should in future be unanimous, like a juryfsverdict in England,  instead of,  as now, by a majority.      This is dealt with in paragraph 125 of the Lewis report and paragraph 27of the Napier report..    The latter sets out the Servicearguments for retaining the present system of findings by amajority, but there is likely to be strong Parliamentary pressure,particularly in the House of Commons,  for the adoption of therecommendation of the Lewis Committee.      I think that this is amatter which must be left to the Service Ministers, who oreconsidering whether there is any intermediate solution wherebysome findings could be unanimous and others by a majority.12. The other recommendations of the Lev/is Committee aresubsidiary or of mainly Departmental interest, and I do not thinkit necessary to refer to them in detail.      The Secretaries ofState and I find ourselves in agreement on all points with theviews of the Napier Committee on these recommendations, with twoexceptions, viz.:-Para.  105(h).      The right of accused to be represented, by representatives with all the rights and duties of Counsel,  at the taking of aSummary of Evidence,  and the correspondingright of the prosecution,  should we thinkbe allowed unless,  in the opinion of the convening officer,  undue delay would resultand the exigencies of the service would makeit impracticable.Paras.  172 and 179.      The Service Departments wish to give further examination to the proposal tointroduce reduction to a penal rate of pay as a new punishment for officers and menbefore coming to a final decision on this.As regards the recommendation in paragraphs 180 and 183, we accept the view of the majority of the Napier Committee thatreduction in rank should not be introduced as a new punishment for officers.
13.      - I ask the Cabinet -(a) to approve in principle the setting up of a Courts-Martial Appeal Court under a Chief Judge Martial,with the constitution and powers recommended bythe Lewis. Committee,  as modified by therecommendations of the Napier Committee,  and with provision for further appeal on a point of law of exceptional public importance, on the fiat of the attorney-General,  to the Judicial Committee of the privy Council;(b) to approve in principle the reconstitution of Courts-Martial under Judge Martial, Deputy Judge Martialor Assistant Judge Martial Presidents;    theabolition of confirmation and review,  andwithdrawal of powers of quashing from all authorities at present possessing them,  including His Majesty,who will of course have to be consulted;(c) to agree that the above proposals should not atpresent be extended to the Navy, but that thequestion of Naval Courts-Martial and a possibleright of appeal for the Navy should be considered in due course in the light of the report of thenew Committee which is being set up to examinethe applicability of the Lewis reforms to navaldisciplinary procedure;(d) to note that in other respects it is proposed togive effect to the recommendations of the lewis committee with the exceptions and qualificationsshown in the Napier report and in the preceding paragraphs;(e) to authorise the Parliamentary Draftsman to proceedforthwith with the drafting of the necessary legislation for inclusion in the Army and Air Force(Annual) Bill,  19U-9,  and to approve the introductionof this legislation in due course, subject toexamination of the Bill when ready by the. Legislation Committee;(f) to authorise the publication of the Lewis committee report as a Command Paper at an early date.House of Lords,  S.W.1.13th December,  19h8.

REPORT OF THE INTER-DEPARTMENTALCOMMITTEE TO CONSIDER THERECOMMENDATIONS IN THE  REPORT OFTHE ARMY AND AIR force courts-MARTIAL COMMITTEE, 1946PART I-introductory. We were appointed by the Lord Chancellor and the Secretaries of Statefor War and Air to consider the recommendations in the report of the Armyand Air Force Courts-Martial Committee, 1946, and to advise whether these recommendations should be adopted. We were also, in cases where we advisedacceptance, to consider what steps would be necessary to put recommendationsinto force by legislation or otherwise.2.

3-    1813. We indicate briefly what appear to us to be the main objectives of the lewis Committee&apos;s recommendations. .....The Committee were evidently convinced that under the existing systemjustice is less manifestly seen to be done in courts-martial than in civiliancourts. Until the changes which took effect on ist October, 1948, the judge advocate General was responsible for the exercise of functions which, inordinary criminal courts, are regarded as incompatible. A member of theforces may be prosecuted before a court-martial for the same serious offenceas a civilian. The civilian has a right of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal,with a public hearing and the right to present his case by Counsel, but no corresponding right is available to the Service man whose conviction andsentence, apart from review from the legal aspect by the Judge advocate general, are subject only to confirmation and review by the Service authorities.Another criticism is that legal representation on courts-martial particularlyDistrict Courts-Martial is insufficient. Unless a Judge Advocate is present,the court has no legal assistance at its disposal corresponding to that providedby a legally qualified Chairman at Quartet Sessions, or the Magistrates&apos; Clerkat Petty Sessions. As it is becoming more common for the accused to be legally represented at courts-martial, it is becoming increasingly unsatisfactoryfor a purely lay court to have to adjudicate in disputes on law and procedure.What the Lewis Committee recommended, in effect, is an assimilation of thecourt-martial system to the ordinary criminal system obtaining in civiliancourts, though they have paid regard to the special exigencies of Serviceconditions.For this purpose they have recommended that : (a) Courts-Martial should continue to be of the same general types as atpresent, viz., General, District and Field General Courts-Martial(the last named to be called in future &quot; Emergency Courts-Martial&quot;).*A General Court-Martial should retain its present jurisdictionand powers, but instead of, as hitherto, being a service court,presided over by a service officer, and advised by a Judge Advocatewho is not necessarily legally qualified, it would be presided overby a Judge Martial or Deputy Judge Martial, who would be a civilian lawyer of suitable experience. His functions would be similar to those of a judge at an Assize Court, he being the solejudge of questions of law and summing up the case, the othermembers of the court consisting of five service officers, who would determine the issue of guilt on the analogy of a jury.District Courts-Martial would be of two types, one, to try themore serious cases, presided over by a civilian lawyer (AssistantJudge Martial) and the other for less serious cases, by a servingofficer, who would, whenever practicable, be a &quot; permanent presi-dent &quot;, employed regularly for such duty at Courts-Martial. Thefirst type would have the jurisdiction and powers at presentpossessed by a District Court-Martial; the second type would beNote. * The difference between a District and a General Court-Martial consistsmainly in their composition and the punishment they can award ; a District Court-Martialcannot try officers and cannot award a sentence of more than two years imprisonment.A General Court-Martial can try any person subject to military law and award anypunishment permitted by the Army or Air Force Acts, including the death penalty. TheField General Court-Martial is an emergency court used on active service or in certaincircumstances abroad not on active service when the convening of a General or DistrictCourt-Martial would be difficult or impossible. On active service, a Field general court-Martial has the same jurisdiction and powers of punishment as a General Court-Martial.    ......(30678) B
,&apos;restricted to a maximum of 12 months imprisonment.   Both typeswould function on the lines of a bench of magistrates and not of: judge and jury; there would be no summing up, and the court would be judge of law and fact.An Emergency Court-Martial would have full powers, but. would..  only be permitted when it was not possible to convene a general court-Martial or a District Court-Martial presided over by an assistant Judge Martial.(b) All findings of guilt or innocence should be unanimous instead of, as now, by a majority.(c) There should be an appeal on questions of law against conviction (butnot sentence) to a newly constituted Court of Appeal which would deal with the case in open court on similar lines to those adoptedin the civil Court of Criminal Appeal, the new right of appeal being in substitution for the existing sj^stem of confirmation and review.(d) The Judge Advocate General, whose title would be changed to &quot; ChiefJudge Martial &quot; and who would preside over the Courts-MartialAppeal Court, should have a status and remuneration not less thanthose of a puisne Judge of the High Court of Justice, but a resolu-tion of both Houses of Parliament would not be a pre-requisite tohis removal. The civilian lawyers chosen must clearly be men of sufficient skill and experience to inspire confidence in the minds of;   . the public and in the two Services.   The Chief Judge Martial, the judges Martial and the remainder of the judicial staff, would beappointed by the Lord Chancellor and the rates of pay, pension,terms of service and promotion must be sufficiently attractive tosecure the right men.4. The above are the main recommendations in the Report which appearto us to call for Ministerial consideration and decision. The numerous other recommendations, though in some cases important and calling for carefuldepartmental consideration, for example the new punishments proposed, are for the most part relatively minor or subsidiary. Our detailed comments andrecommendations on all the proposals will be found below in the order inwhich the Lewis Committee&apos;s recommendations are set out in Chapter VII oftheir Report, but we think it desirable first to make some general comments onthe main recommendations referred to above, acceptance or rejection of whichwill in effect amount to acceptance or rejection of the Report.5. The Lewis Committee&apos;s object, as already indicated in paragraph above and as stated briefly in paragraph 196 of their Report, is to remove the defects of the existing system, and enhance the value of the Court-Martialsystem as an instrument of justice, by reconstituing the courts in the manner described at (a) of paragraph 3 above and providing a right of oral appeal against conviction. These changes, they say, will go far towards relieving theordinary officer of responsibility ^or deciding disputed questions of law, forwhich he seldom has the necessary knowledge and experience, and at the sametime render the existing procedure of confirmation and automatic review ofconviction, with all its demands upon time and labour, unnecessary. we agree that the substitution of a lawyer president and the change to whatamounts to a judge and jury system will be an undoubted improvement, andwe think that the latter procedure, if adopted, should apply not only to theGeneral Court-Martial, but to the District Court-Martial presided over by an assistant Judge Martial. It will be noticed that the Lewis Committee recom-mend the abolition of confirmation and automatic review, and the substitution of a right of oral appeal, not only in the case of courts presided over, by a
lawyer but also in the case of a District Court-Martial with a lay president.The abolition of review and substitution of a right of appeal naturally gotogether.Whether the abolition of automatic review of proceedings and the substitu-tion of an oral right of appeal will in fact be to the real benefit of the soldierand result in a greater measure of justice being done than under the presentsystem is arguable. At present the proceedings of every court-martial are carefully scrutinized by trained lawyers who bring to light any flaw or any-thing which suggests a possible miscarriage of justice, and in a large numberof cases the proceedings are quashed even where a Judge Advocate has beenemployed (sometimes, it must be admitted, on technical legal grounds affectingjurisdiction, where the accused was clearly guilty), and this is done withoutany initiative from the accused. The number of such cases would naturally be fewer with trained lawyer presidents in all the more serious cases, but manycases would no doubt still arise. Under the new system it will rest with the accused to ask for leave to appeal and if he does not do so the conviction andsentence will stand. The grounds of appeal, even if extended as we proposeto cover mixed law and fact or fact alone with the leave of the court, will necessarily be narrower than those on which the proceedings have in the past been upset on review. Moreover, in the type of District Court-Martial orEmergency Court-Martial where there is no summing up it will not be possibleto say whether a Court has misdirected itself, and it may be difficult to sub-stantiate an appeal on grounds of law.It may, therefore, well be that the new system, while giving a greater appear-ance of justice, may in fact work out less favourably to many men than thepresent system, though this may not involve any real injustice where thequashing under the present system results merely from- some technical flaw.It will be remembered that both the Darling Committee of 1919 and the OliverCommittee of 1938 advised against the introduction of a right of oral appeal,and considered that in the case of persons convicted by Court-Martial thereexisted a series of safeguards against injustice at least equal to those applyingin the case of civilians convicted of crime in the Civil Courts.On the other hand there is no doubt a strong feeling among Members ofParliament and the public that a review of proceedings by the Judge advocate general does not in fact afford the same safeguard against injustice as theinstitution of a right of appeal and hearing in open court, and while a good case might be made on practical grounds for a retention of the present system,improved and simplified, it will probably be felt that politically, if for no other reason, it is hardly practicable to reject the solution to which the Lewis Com-mittee have now given the weight of their authority.6. A further point to which we must draw attention, however, is thatwhile we see no reason why the new system as recommended should not workin peace-time, we are apprehensive of the danger of its breakdown in war ifthe numbers of Courts-Martial in the Army and the Royal Air Force approach the annual total of over 53,000 at the peak reached in the last war. Of this total some 47,000 cases were tried by Field General Court-Martial, of which only 2,300 had the assistance of a Judge Advocate. This figure of 53,000 isnot far short of ten times that upon which the Lewis Committee based itsestimate of the new establishment required in time of peace in Appendix Gof their Report namely 5,500 Courts-Martial per annum. A conseivative&apos;estimate, therefore, of the number of legal personnel required in war will beeight to ten times the numbers shown in Appendix C of the Lewis committee report, as required for the Office of the Chief Judge Martial and the Director-ates of Army and Air Force Legal Services. This would involve an expansionof a peace strength of approximately 80 lawyers to over 650.
The greatest number of legal staff employed in the Judge Advocate General&apos;office  during the recent war, embracing the three Departments-Military, AirForce and Judicial at home and abroad (including India) did not exceed 300.It may well be, therefore, that the required numbers of legal personnel for thenew system in war will not be forthcoming, in which case to avoid a break-down of the system it would ne necessary to have recourse to a great many more Emergency Courts-Martial than the Lewis Committee envisaged. TheseCourts would have no legal personnel.Similar considerations, of course, apply in the case of the panel of legalpersonnel required to deal with appeals. Assuming that ten per cent, ofaccused appeal against convictions, there would in war-time be a need for at-least ten divisions of the Appeal Court on the assumption that each divisioncould deal with as many as 500 appeals in a year. Even if thirty lawyers ofthe requisite calibre could be found to man these divisions there would,&apos; wethink, be considerable delays, particularly in those cases coming home fromCommands and forces overseas, apart from delays due to enemy action here.Such delays might become intolerable and the appellate system in consequencebe in danger of breaking down. Consequently we think it advisable to recom-ment that if the new system is adopted His Majesty should be empowered inthe new legislation, by Order in Council, in an emergency temporarily to suspend the operation of the system of oral appeal and substitute therefor aSystem of review on petition by the Chief Judge MartiaFs department in thecase of appeals against conviction.7. With regard to the other points enumerated in paragraph 3 above, inthe case of (b), for the reasons set out in paragraph 27 below we do not agreethat findings of guilt or innocence should be unanimous, and as regards (d) thequestion of the status and remuneration of the Chief Judge Martial and of his staff and of the Directorates of Legal Services is under active considerationbetween the Departments and the Treasury. The status and remuneration ofthe Chief Judge Martial himself will no doubt be decided by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the light ,of the views of the Lord Chancellor and the Chancellorof the Exchequer.8. We have not regarded it as coming within our terms of reference to enquire into the extent to which the recommendations of the Lewis committee might be applied to the naval court-martial system, but it is clear that adop-tion by the Army and the Royal Air Force of certain-of these recommendationsmay give rise to a demand that the Navy should come into line.There are, however, strong reasons for taking decisions one way or anotheron the main principles of the Lewis Committee&apos;s recommendations in respectof the Army and the Royal Air Force. Apart from the Parliamentary difficultyof further postponement, there is a danger of the existing court-martial systembreaking down unless provision is made soon for a permanent pensionablestaff on the judicial side to be recruited in the near future; and the qualifica-tions of the staff and the legislation needed will depend on the decisions taken.We therefore urge that the possibility of repercussions on the Royal navy should not delay decisions upon the Lewis Committee&apos;s recommendations inrespect of the Army and the Royal Air Force.
Delays before trial.9. Recommendation in paragraph 83 (a) :That the 8-day Report be rendered whether the accused is on active service or not, unless operational conditions make it impossible in anyparticular case.Under Section 45 of the Army and Air Force Acts, in every case where anofficer, soldier or airman not on active service remains in military custody fora longer period than 8 days without a court-martial for his trial being ordered to assemble, a special report of the necessity for further delay must be madeby his commanding officer ; and a similar report must be rendered every 8days until a court-martial is assembled or the officer, soldier or airman isreleased from arrest.We agree with the recommendation that this report should be renderedunder all conditions of service where the accused is in close arrest; but incases where the accused, whether on active service or not, is not in close arrestwe recommend that 30-day reports should be rendered.There is a further point of importance in this connection affecting manyprovisions of the Army and Air Force Acts, and a number of the Committee&apos;sother recommendations, to which our attention has been drawn but which wasnot dealt with in the Report of the Lewis Committee. This relates to the determination of when troops are to be regarded as being on &quot; active service &quot;within the meaning of the Army and Air Force Acts.This determination under section 189(1) of the Acts is made a question of fact in the United Kingdom and elsewhere where no declaration under section189(2) is in force. As the question can finally be determined only by a Courtit has been found, extremely difficult in the varying conditions at home andabroad following the cessation of hostilities for the authorities concerned tosay at what particular moment troops in fact cease to be on &quot; active service &quot;.In these circumstances we recommend an amendment of section 189 of theArmy and Air Force Acts so as to enable His Majesty by Order in Council, or if thought proper the Army or Air Councils, as the case may be, by order, to declare that the whole or any part of the military or air forces serving in all areas or in any particular area during any particular period is on &quot; active service &quot;.10. Recommendation in paragraph 83 (b) :That a copy of the 8-day report be sent direct by the commanding officer to the Director of Army Legal Services or the Director of AirForce Legal Services. (The appointment of these Directors was one of the interim recommendations of the Lewis Committee : see paragraph 22below.) After receiving three such reports the said Director to make further inquiries of the Service authorities and be given power, afterconsultation with these authorities, to issue orders to secure a speedytrial. The Director should also be empowered to recommend to thegeneral officer commanding or air officer commanding the formation thatthe accused should be released forthwith or after a specified interval,failing his being tried in the meantime.We concur in this recommendation, except that we do not consider thatthe Director of Legal Services should be empowered to issue orders to secure a speedy trial.   In this respect, as in the case of release of the accused from(30678) c
arrest, we are of opinion that the Director&apos;s powers should be limited to therecommending of a course of action to the general officer or air officer cora-manding the formation concerned.II. Recommendation in paragraph 83(c) : &apos;That after being in close arrest for 28 days without a court-martial&quot;having been convened an accused should have the right to petition the-: &apos; Chief Judge Martial against continued detention.   The Chief judge martial should make appropriate representations to the Secretary ofState.   (See paragraph 24 below for the recommendation that the title ofthe Judge Advocate General be changed to .&quot; Chief Judge Martial &quot;.)- The purpose of this recommendation, with which we agree, is to provide afurther safeguard against unnecessary delay by enabling the accused to bring to notice the fact that he is still awaiting trial. The Chief Judge Martialshould be empowered to delegate authority to receive these petitions to hisdeputies in overseas Commands. The latter should take action locally andsend the petitions to the Chief Judge Martial who would, if necessary, thenmake representations to the Secretary of State.12. Recommendation in paragraph 83 (d) :That it be made illegal to retain an accused in close arrest for longer&apos; than 90 days without a court-martial having been convened and havingassembled. At the expiration of this period an accused should be released:  and not subject to re-arrest for the same offence except on the writtenorder of an officer having power to convene a court-martial for the trial of the offence. -  -Section 45 of the Army and Air Force Acts lays down that the charge made against every person taken into military custody shall be investigated &quot; with-out unnecessary delay &quot;. We agree that this is not sufficiently specific and advise acceptance of this recommendation provided it is made clear, as is nodoubt intended by the Lewis Committee, that this written order of the con-vening officer may operate to authorize immediate re-arrest for a further 90days, i.e., that in effect the accused can, under this authority, be kept underarrest continuously. It would be most undesirable if, for example, a manunder arrest for a capital offence had actually to be released for a period and.formally re-arrested.13. Recommendation in paragraph 84 : -That provision be made enabling the prosecution and the defence togive evidence of facts by way of statutory declaration, subject to the safe-guards enumerated in (a) to (c) of paragraph 84. Depositions on oath,being part of the Summary of Evidence, should also be admissible inevidence.We advise acceptance of this recommendation, which is designed to obviatedelays which now occur owing to the fact that a good deal of time has to be wasted in securing the attendance of witnesses whose evidence may be purelyformal or undisputed.14. Recommendation in paragraph 85 :That all concerned be urged that soldiers should be kept in open andnot close arrest awaiting trial, or released without prejudice to re-arrest,subject to considerations of security or discipline.We advise acceptance of this recommendation.
Legal aid before and during trial.15. Recommendation in paragraph 96 :That the Commanding Officer ensure that, before a man is brought in front of him charged with an offence for which the man may be tried by court-martial, he shall be advised by a suitable person of any rank.We advise acceptance of this recommendation.16. Recommendations in paragraph 103(a), (b), (c) and (d) :That at the investigation of a charge not disposed of summarily the commanding officer should record a short precis of evidence;That the commanding officer should forward a report of the case withthe precis of evidence and material documents to the superior authority with a view to the case being brought before a court-martial;That, if the convening officer decides that there is a prima facie case for trial by court-martial, the accused should be served, free of charge witha copy of the abstract of evidence not less than 48 hours before the trialbegins;That a Summary of Evidence need not be taken unless (i) ordered bythe convening officer or (ii) required by the accused, or (iii) the case isone in which sentence of death or penal seivitude for life may be passed.We advise acceptance of these recommendations. .    -17. Recommendation in paragraph 103(e) :That an accused be not entitled to require a Summary without leave of the convening officer, if charged with any offence for which the maximumpunishment does not exceed two years&apos; imprisonment, but be entitled torequire a Summary as of right in all other cases.If the recommendations in paragraphs 208, 209 and 214 of the Lewis Com-mittee report are accepted, a District Court-Martial, whether or not preside over by an Assistant Judge Martial, will have power to try cases of desertion.Under Section 12 of the Army and Air Force Acts the maximum punishment for desertion if committed when on active service, or when not on active service if for a second or subsequent offence, exceeds two years&apos; imprisonment.This recommendation would, therefore, permit an accused charged with desertionbefore a District Court-Martial to demand a Summary as of right. We do not agree that this should be the case and we feel that, the Lewis Committee&apos;intention was in fact to restrict the right to demand a Summary to cases wherethe accused is to be tried before a General Court-Martial, which can awardmore than two years&apos; imprisonment. We, therefore, advised acceptance of thisrecommendation with the proviso that in cases which are remitted to any typeof District Court-Martial the accused should not have the right to demand aSummary of Evidence.18. Recommendation in paragraph 1 Q3(/) :That an accused be asked in writing in every case whether he desires to apply for, or to exercise his right to require the taking of, a Summary,and should reply in writing.We recommend the acceptance of this recommendation.19. Recommendation in paragraph 103(g) :That the officer detailed to take the Summary be appointed by the convening officer and be a permanent president or other officer with suitable experience or legal qualifications. In cases of exceptional diffi-culty or importance a member of the Chief Judge MartiaFs Departmentmight be appointed. ....(30678) c 2
IOWe concur in the first part of this recommendation but consider that thereare strong objections to a member of the Chief Judge Martial&apos;s Departmentbeing appointed to take a Summary of Evidence as recommended in the second part. This would throw a considerable burden on the Department and might involve delays. There are many places abroad where the Chief Judge Martialwill have no representative. Moreover, the proposal appears to be at variance with the principle of complete separation of pre-trial and judicial functions,the importance of which is emphasised in paragraphs 108 to no of the lewis committee&apos;s Report. The effect of its adoption would be that officials of theChief Judge Martiafs Department at home and abroad would be seized of allthe details of a number of cases of importance or difficulty before trial, andthe mischief which the separation is designed to avoid would inevitably revivein the mind of the public. Further, the official taking the Summary is merelya recording officer and has no judicial functions. We see no reason whyofficers of the Services Legal Directorates should not be charged with the dutyof taking the summary in difficult cases, provided of course that the officer inquestion had not previously investigated the case and did not subsequentlyact as prosecutor.. 20. Recommendation in paragraph 103(A) :That the Summary of Evidence be taken in the presence of the accusedwho shall be entitled to be represented, and his representative to have all the rights and duties of counsel.Having regard to the arguments set out in paragraphs 100 to 102 of the lewis Committee Report and the other recommendations in paragraph 103, weadvise acceptance of this recommendation though we feel it necessary to pointout that its effect may be to create considerable delays in important cases ;and difficulties may result in war-time. We recommend, as we assume is theintention of the Lewis Committee, that both prosecution and defence beentitled -to be represented at the taking of the summary.21. Recommendation in paragraph 103(4) :That all evidence taken at the Summary be on oath.We advise acceptance of this recommendation.Judge Advocate General.22. Recommendations in paragraphs 107 to 109 :That the Judge Advocate General should be appointed on the recom-iriendation of the Lord Chancellor and be responsible to him. In relationto the Secretaries of State the duties of the Judge Advocate general should continue to be advisory in character;That a separate department in charge of a &quot; Director of Army LegalServices &quot; should be constituted under the Secretary of State for War;That a separate department in charge of a &quot; Director of Air Force. Legal Services &quot; should be constituted under, the Secretary of State forAir;That the separation of functions should be extended to Commandsabroad where the Judge Advocate General and these Directors wouldeach have a Deputy with the necessary staff ;That until the new system be introduced the Judge Advocate general should be responsible only for the work at present done by the JudicialDepartment, i.e., the supply of judge advocates, the review of court-- martial proceedings, and the tendering of advice on questions of law arisingout of such proceedings.
These recommendations have already been dealt with on the Interim Reportof the Lewis Committee, and the consequent changes took effect on the istOctober, 1948.23. Recommendations in paragraphs 112 and 113 :That the establishment of the proposed new departments should be asset out in Appendix C of the Lewis Committee Report;That the rates of pay, pension, terms of service and promotion in thenew departments should be such as to attract lawyers of skill and experi-ence. Special consideration should be given to those who have beenDeputy Judge Advocates General abroad.We recommend approval in principle of this recommendation subject tothe settlement of details of establishments and terms and conditions of service between the departments concerned and the Treasury, who have the matter under active consideration.24. Recommendation in paragraph 114 :That the title of the Judge Advocate General should be changed to&quot; Chief Judge Martial &quot;. His status and remuneration should be not lessthan that of a puisne Judge of the High Court of Justice but a resolution of both Houses of Parliament should not be a pre-requisite to his removal.We agree with the proposed new title of the Judge Advocate General.The question of his status and remuneration is under consideration betweenthe Lord Chancellors Department and the Treasury.The Judge Advocate.25. Recommendation in paragraphs 115 and 116 :That, so long as judge advocates are retained, they should not retirewith the court when the latter is considering its findings.This recommendation has already been accepted and put into effect.Findings and sentences announcement.26. Recommendations in paragraphs 117 and 120 :That findings of guilt should be announced in open court at once ;That sentence should be announced in open court as soon as deter-mined.These recommendations have already been accepted and put into effect.Findings by a majority.27. Recommendation in paragraph 125 : *That all findings of guilt or innocence should be unanimous. Ondisagreement the accused should be liable to be retried by another court-martial with different membership.We do not agree with this recommendation. Its acceptance would, weconsider, have unfortunate results. The Lewis Committee intend that itshould apply not only to the Judge and Jury type of trial (the General Court-Martial) but to the Bench of Magistrates type (the District Court-Martial and emergency Court-Martial). In civil life the verdict of the latter is throughoutthe United Kingdom by a majority, while in Scotland the majority verdict is general in all courts. If acquittal has to be unanimous a majority for suchacquittal will only secure disagreement, and there will have to be a re-trial if
the accused is to be entitled to a verdict. These re-trials would of necessitycause considerable&apos;delay, difficulties and dislocation of their normal work to service personnel, including witnesses and others, particularly on active service.Further, if proceedings after disagreement were to be dropped withoutre-trial, the interests of justice and the maintenance of discipline would be adversely affected. The very fact of such disagreement and re-trials may be contrary to the best interests of the Services. Certainty of decision is mostimportant in a disciplined force, particularly in the case of an officer, warrant officer or senior non-commissioned officer charged with a serious offence. no case can be left unsettled without an adverse effect on discipline. Under theexisting court-martial system an accused is either found guilty or not guilty.&quot; Disagreement &quot; cannot occur. A majority or even an equality of votes infavour of an accused secures an acquittal and a majority for guilt a conviction.There is no uncertainty of decision.Moreover, in the case of Service tribunals, if findings have to be unanimous,junior officers may tend to be unduly influenced by the opinions of officers ofsuperior rank. Even under the existing system junior officers record theirvote first, in order to guard as far as possible against any such influence. Thisis a factor not present in civil procedure.For all these reasons we recommend rejection of this proposal, and no alteration in the existing practice. .;28. Recommendation in paragraph 126 :That, unanimity on sentence not being necessary, no alteration bemade in the existing practice whereby sentence is decided by a majorityof votes.We advise acceptance of this recommendation. There is, however, one case in which unanimity on&apos;sentence is at present required, namely, a death sentence imposed by Field General Court-Martial (Army and Air Force Actss. 49(2)) and this should continue in the case of the Emergency Court Martial,which under the Lewis Committee&apos;s proposals is to replace the Field general court-Martial (see paragraph 63 below).Shorthand writers.29. Recommendations in paragraphs 129 and 130 :That a shorthand writer be employed in all capital cases tried byGeneral Court-Martial. The convening officer to notify the Judge advocates-cate General (or, in due course, the Director of Army Legal Services orthe Director of Air Force Legal Services) asking for a shorthand writerto be provided in capital cases and in others which, in his opinion, are sufficiently serious or complicated to justify the employment of a short-hand writer;That responsibility for supplying a shorthand writer be upon the judge advocate General (or Director) who should supply one from his own staffor secure one from an outside firm. If none is available, the conveningofficer should be notified to that effect and he in turn should notify thePresident of the Court-Martial, the notification being read in open courtat the commencement of the trial.We agree with these recommendations, but consider that they represent only the minimum standard which should be aimed at. We consider that ashorthand writer should attend at least every General Court-Martial if at allpossible. We have been informed that in the Navy, a shorthand note is taken of every court-martial and that the work is adequately performed by members
of the writer branch of the Royal Navy or W.R.N.S. We therefore feel thatit should not be impossible for.the other two Services to adopt &quot;similar measures.It is essential that they should do so if our recommendation is to be put intoeffect, since the provision of shorthand writers from civilian sources for allGeneral Courts-Martial is not practicable, in view of their scarcity and the fact.that courts-martial are held in many different parts of the world.Other points.30. Recommendation in paragraph 133(2&apos;) :That the President of a Court-Martial be given power to amend thecharge upon similar conditions to those prescribed in Section 5 of theIndictments Act, 1915.*We advise acceptance of this recommendation.3r. Recommendation in paragraph 133(11) :. That a court-martial be empowered to take into consideration other offences admitted by the accused, subject to the -qualifications (a) thatsuch other offences be similar in character and triable by court-martialand (b) that stoppages of pay, where appropriate, may be imposed .foreach offence which the accused wishes to be taken into consideration, but;(c); that the sentence should not exceed the maximum for the offenceactually charged. ,; ..-   -We advise acceptance of this recommendation, which is designed to reducethe present practice of preferring a multiplicity of charges, particularly where this is necessary under the present system to recover losses by means of stop-pages of pay. At present, under the Army and Air Force Acts, a charge mustbe preferred and a conviction be recorded before an accused can be put undercompulsory stoppages of pay, and the fact that offences other than&apos; the one with which the person was charged were taken into consideration in awardingsentence would not, as things stand, have the effect of a conviction in respectof them. The Army and Air Force Acts will, therefore, have to be amended togive effect to this recommendation.32. Recommendations in paragraphs 133 (hi) to (v) : -That a court-martial be given after finding and before sentence some kind of record of the accused&apos;s career as is now given in a civil criminalcourt;That the form for convening a Field General Court-Martial be amended as regards the opening recital, which might be read to imply that the convening officer is satisfied as to the guilt of the accused ;:That an attempt be made to define the offence of mutiny, which the lewis Committee think in present day conditions is capable of too widean interpretation.* Sections 5 (1) and 5 (2) of the Indictments Act, 1915, read as follows :-3. (1) Where, before trial, or at any stage of a trial, it appears to the court that theindictment is defective, the court shall make such order for the amendment ofthe indictment as the court thinks necessary to meet the circumstances of thecase unless, having rega;d to the merits of the case, the required amendments-cannot be made without injustice; and may make such order as to the paymentof any costs incurred&apos; owing to the necessity for amendment as the courtthinks fit.(2) Where an indictment is so amended, a note of the order for amendment shallbe endorsd on the indictment, and the indictment shall be treated for thepurposes of the trial and for the purposes of all proceedings in connection therewith as having been found by the grand jury in the amendecV form.
We advise acceptance of these recommendations, except that we wouldutter a warning&quot; against any attempt to define the offence of mutiny otherthan as &quot; collective insubordination, or a combination of two or more persons to resist or induce others to resist lawful authority&quot;. This is the definitiongiven in the Manual of Military Law, where it is made clear that a charge ofmutiny should not be brought, even in cases of collective insubordination,unless there appears to be a combined design to resist authority. We doubt the wisdom of weakening this definition or of making any alteration in thecurrent interpretation of the offence.Appeal against conviction.33. Recommendation in paragraph 143 :That an appeal on a question of law be granted against convictionwhenever an accused has pleaded &quot;not guilty&quot;, such right of appealtaking the place of the present system of review of proceedings by the judge Advocate General.This recommendation, together with those for the reconstitution of courts-martial in paragraphs 51 et seq. below, is the fundamental proposal of the lewis Committee, and we have dealt with it at length in our preliminarycomments in paragraphs 3 to 7 above. On balance, for the reasons theregiven, we recommend acceptance in principle subject to provision being madefor the suspension in emergency of the right of oral appeal and the substitution of a system of review by the Chief Judge Martiafs department on writtenpetition by the accused. Our recommendation in this and the following paragraphs are made on the assumption that the fundamental changes recom-mended by the Lewis Committee are accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government inprinciple.We think that the Lewis Committee did not intend to limit appeals strictlyto those on questions of law only. Their main concern was to prevent arehearing on a question of fact such as occurs in an appeal to Quarter Sessions.Sections 3 and 4(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1907, are reproduced below*and we think that the Courts-Martial Appeal Court should have, Mutatis Mutandis, similar powers. Our reason for this recommendation is that a mis-carriage of justice arising for instance out of some irregularity occurring duringthe trial may involve questions of law, or of fact or of mixed law and fact.* Sections 3 and 4 (1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1907, read as follows : 3. A person convicted on indictment may appeal under tbis Act to the Court of criminal Appeal (a) against his conviction on any ground of appeal which involves a question of lawalone ; and(6) with the leave of the Court of Criminal Appeal or upon the certificate of the judge who tried him that it is a fit case for appeal against his conviction onany ground of appeal which involves a question of face alone, or a question ofmixed law and fact, or any other ground which appears to the court to be asufficient ground of appeal.4. (1) The Court of Criminal Appeal on any such appeal against conviction shall allow the appeal if they think that the verdict of ihe jury should be set aside on the groundthat it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court before whom the appellant was convicted should be set aside on theground of a wrong decision of any question of law or that on any ground there was amiscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal;Provided that the court may, nocwiths-anding that they are of opinion that the -point raised in the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant,, dismiss the appeal if theyconsider that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred,
Questions of law arise when it is alleged that there is a defect in the indict-ment ; or that evidence has been wrongfully admitted or excluded ; or thatthe judge has misdirected the jury upon a point of law : or that there was nocorroboration, where such is necessary ; or that the judge has wrongfullyrefused or omitted to withdraw a case from the consideration of the jury byreason of there being no evidence in support of the charge ; or that the judge&apos;sconstruction of the verdict has been wrong in law. Questions of fact arisewhere it is alleged that there has been a miscarriage of justice by reason of the judge having misdirected the jury in regard to the evidence ; or because theverdict of the jury was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence,or because of some irregularity occurring during the trial. In certain cases there may be some doubt whether the question involved is really one of lawor of fact; and such cases may presumably be regarded as falling under the heading of questions of mixed law and fact.We also recommend that the Courts-Martial Appeal Court should havepower to hear an appeal at the instance of the Service authorities, even wherethe accused has pleaded guilty, if he was tried by a Court-Martial not preside over by a Judge President. The Service authorities, in exercising their powerto review sentences, find in practice that the plea in mitigation of sentencesometimes shows that the plea of guilty was a mistake and one which is not always due to the fault of the accused. At present the Royal Prerogativeincludes power to quash a conviction by Cpurt-Martial (though not a convic-tion by a civil court). This power would have to be superseded, if there is tobe a Courts-Martial Appeal Court, and that Court would necessarily have the sole power of quashing a conviction. The powers, therefore, of that court should, we think, be enlarged to the limited extent proposed above.34. Recommendation in paragraph 144 :That the Court of Appeal should consist of the Chief Judge Martial,Vice-Chief Judge Martial, and the Judges Martial. In addition, a panelshould be formed, approved by the Lord Chancellor, of King&apos;s Counselwilling to serve on such a Court. Any three would constitute a Court.The court should normally sit in London or at other convenient centres in the United Kingdom but in exceptional circumstances might sit abroad.The Court should have power in exceptional cases to quash a convictionby Court-Martial where an error of law has occurred sufficiently seriousto make it unsafe to allow a conviction to stand, but should.have powerto affirm a conviction even if an error of law has occurred provided it is satisfied that no substantial miscarriage of justice has thereby takenplace. The Court should be referred to as the &quot; Courts-Martial appeal court &quot;.We advise acceptance of this recommendation but we consider that theLord Chancellor should not be barred by statute from accepting barristers whoare not King&apos;s Counsel but are specially qualified by experience, for appointment to the panel of the Appeal Court. A retired Chief Justice from India, forexample, who was not a K.C. might nevertheless be an appropriate member.The powers of the court referred to in this recommendation, should includethe power to commit Service personnel for contempt, as also the power ofsubstitution analogous to that now held by His Majesty and the Army andAir Councils, and power to pass a fresh sentence consequential on a substitutedfinding or on the quashing of a major charge or one of several charges. Weconsider these powers essential to the Appeal Court, which we recommend should be a superior court of record.We do not recommend, however, that the Appeal Court should have powerto commit civilians for contempt of court except when the court is sitting in
a country where there is no civil court to which cases of contempt could appro-appropriately be referred. In Great Britain such contempt should be certified tothe High Court which should have power to punish the offender in the same manner as if he had been guilty of contempt of that court; and in theDominions and colonies a civil court of superior jurisdiction could in most cases act in the same way. Contempt of court by counsel should in our view be dealt with in like manner. This procedure, we may add, already operateswithin the United Kingdom in the case of courts-martial under the authorityof section 126 of the Army and Air Force Acts, to sub-section 4 of which wewould direct attention in so far as a trial held in a Dominion is concerned.35. Recommendation in paragraph 145 :That leave to appeal be granted by the certificate of a Court-Martialor on an accused&apos;s application within 14 days. Application should besent to the Chief Judge Martial or to the Judge Martial in the command in which the accused is serving. The Chief Judge Martial or the saidJudge Martial should grant or refuse leave, notifying his decision inwriting to the accused or legal representative. If the decision is adverse,the accused should have the right within a further 14 days to apply tothe Courts-Martial Appeal Court./&quot; :We advise acceptance of this recommendation. The Appeal Court wouldrequire power in exceptional cases to extend the period within which leave to appeal might be sought.36. Recommendation in paragraph 146 :That the application be heard orally, the defence having the right ofaudience and to be legally represented. If leave to appeal be granted, the appeal should be argued there and then or at some later and convenientdate. The accused should have the right to be present in capital cases and in others by leave of the Courts-Martial Appeal Court.We advise acceptance of this recommendation. We do not consider thatthe accused should have the right to be present except in cases where theappellant is actually under sentence of death and we assume this to be themeaning of the phrase &quot; in capital cases &quot; used in the Lewis Committee Report.A comparatively small number of death sentences was actually carried out during the last war, though the number of sentences of death passed was muchgreater. Many of these were subsequently commuted on confirmation orpetition. It is obvious, therefore, that if all men charged with offences forwhich the maximum punishment is death had the right to be present at the hearing by the Appeal Court,, a very considerable number of persons mighthave to be brought home from overseas theatres in time of war.Practising members of the Bar and legally qualified officers of the ServiceDirectorates, and legally qualified defending&quot; officers (whether barristers orsolicitors) should, in our view, have an absolute right of audience before theCourts-Martial Appeal Court. This right should also be extended to solicitorsin private practice who have appeared for the accused before the Court-Martial.Otherwise, solicitors in private practice and defending officers who are notlegally qualified should not, we feel, have the right of audience except by leave of the Courts-Martial Appeal Court, such leave being obtained on writtenapplication before the hearing.
uThat the Courts-Martial Appeal Court should have power to order inthe case of a frivolous application for leave to appeal that the sentenceshall begin to run as from the date of the dismissal of the application.A sentence should not be suspended automatically merely because anaccused applies for leave to appeal, but it should be open to the Conrt-Martial, the Judge Maitial in the Command or the Courts-Martial appeal court on giving leave to appeal to recommend to the appropriate military authority that sentence be suspended.We advise acceptance of this recommendation. The reference to the dateof dismissal of the application as being the date from which a sentence shallrun must, of course, refer only to sentences involving physical restraint, since it would be of advantage to an accused person sentenced to, say, reduction tothe ranks, to delay the date from which such a sentence was to run.38. Recommendation in paragraph 148 :That, in the Colonies, local barristers of repute and judges might beput on the panel of Appeal Judges and help to form a Court.We advise acceptance of this recommendation, though care may be needed in some cases to avoid the disclosure of secret information to unauthorisedpersons.39. Recommendation in paragraph 149 :That the system of confirmation should be abolished as well as the review of Courts-Martial proceedings by the Judge Advocate General.We advise acceptance of this recommendation. The Lewis committee epropose retention of confirmation in the case of Emergency Courts-Martial, asto which see paragraph 63 below. .40. Recommendation in paragraph 150 :That the present and new systems run concurrently for a time, with atime limit set for persons convicted under the present system to have their cases reviewed. The right to petition the Sovereign should remain,the Chief Judge MartiaFs Department advising upon new petitions when required.We consider that the right to petition the Sovereign on clemency must remain but there should be a time limit, say two years, on the right underKing&apos;s Regulations to petition the reviewing authorities, including the sovereign, against the validity of convictions by Courts-Martial held underthe present system.   -      .   ... ^     .41. Recommendation in paragraph 151 :That there be a right of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the privy council on the Attorney-General&apos;s fiat when an important point of law is involved.We advise acceptance of this recommendation and consider that the Serviceauthority concerned should also have a similar right of appeal to the JudicialCommittee.   This will involve statutory provision conferring powers on the
Courts-Martial Appeal Court analogous to those exercisable by the Court of criminal Appeal under Section 16(2) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1925.* Itshould be noted that the Judicial Committee will require the power of substitu-tion and of passing a fresh sentence consequential thereon or on the quashingof a major charge or one of several charges.42. Recommendation in paragraph 158 :That the Courts-Martial Appeal Court should not hear appeals againstsentence.We advise acceptance of this recommendation. It is based on the lewis committee&apos;s view, with which we agree, that the final word upon punishmentmust remain with the Service authorities, upon whom the duty of maintainingdiscipline is laid.43. Recommendations in paragraph 164 :That jurisdiction over sentence should remain entirely with the service authorities;That the power of the Service authorities to mitigate, remit or commutesentences should be preserved ;That the officer who would have been the confirming officer should consider and review the sentence as soorij as possible after it has been passed and, if he thinks fit, mitigate, remit or commute ;That the Adjutant-General&apos;s and the Air Member for PersonnelsDepartment should continue to review sentences as at present;That the right to petition any reviewing authority, including the King,should be preserved.We advise acceptance of these recommendations subject to the power ofof the Appeal Court or Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to pass afresh sentence in certain cases as recommended in the comments in paragraphs30 and 37 above. The power of Service authorities to mitigate, remit or com-mute would apply to sentences as altered by the Appeal Court or JudicialCommittee. We would also propose that the Service authorities should havethe right to consult the Chief Judge MartiaTs Department regarding thelegality of any sentence.Punishments (other ranks).44. Recommendation in paragraph 168 :That there should be no alteration in the character or method ofawarding punishments for other ranks.We advise acceptance of this recommendation.* Sections 16 (1) and 16 (2) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1925, read as follows : 16. (1) An application to the Attorney-General under subsection (6) of section one ofthe Criminal Appeal Act, 1907, for a certificate authorising an appeal to theHouse of Lords from the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, shall bemade within a period of seven days from the date when the decision of thecourt was given.(2) Where the Court of Criminal Appeal has allowed an appeal against convictionand the prosecutor gives notice to the court immediately after the decision ofthe court has been given on the appeal that he intends to apply to the attorney-General for such a certificate as aforesaid, the court may make anorder providing for the detention of the defendant, or directing that the defendant shall not be released except on bail, until either the Attorney-General has refused to grant the certificate or a decision on the appeal hasbeen given by the House of Lords, as the case may be.
189That &quot; reduction to a penal rate of pay&quot; should be introduced as apunishment (with the right to elect trial by Court-Martial) awardable bythe same officers as are now empowered to award detention and by acourt-martial.We agree. The detailed scheme will require to be worked out by the WarOffice and Air Ministry.46. Recommendations in paragraphs 187, 188 and 189 :That the existing powers of commanding officers be not reduced norextended, except that the power to award &quot; reduction to a penal rate of pay &quot; for 14 days should be added to their existing powers, subject to theright of the accused to elect trial by court-martial.Acceptance of this recommendation must, of course, in so far as it concernsreduction to a penal rate of pay, depend upon the decision reached in regardto the introduction of this form of punishment. But we concur in the recom-mendation to make no alteration to the commanding officers powers in other respects.Punishments (officers).47. Recommendation in paragraph 177 :That there should be no restrictions on officers&apos; liberty (for example,confinement to quarters) nor stoppage of leave.We agree with the Lewis Committee&apos;s contention that confinement toquarters or stoppage of leave, as punishments, are not consistent with theexercise of leadership.48. Recommendation in paragraphs 179 and 185 :That &quot; reduction to a penal rate of pay &quot; should be introduced as apunishment for officers as proposed for other ranks, and that power begiven for a summary award of this punishment under Section 47 of theArmy and Air Force Acts, subject to the right of the accused to elect trialby court-martial.We agree, provided that reduction to a penal rate is accepted as a punish-ment for other ranks.49. Recommendation in paragraphs 180 and 183 :That reduction in rank should be introduced as a punishment award-able by court-martial.We appreciate the reasons which led the Lewis Committee to make thisrecommendation, and we note their view that it would be useful chiefly as a deterrent and if introduced would in all probability be rarely made use of,particularly for Regular officers. With the exception of the Air Ministryrepresentatives we are, however, not in favour of the proposal for the following reasons.While it may be that in practice this punishment would be rarely used ifit were introduced into the Army and Air Force Acts, a court-martial couldnot be prevented from awarding it.In peace-time, in the case of the ordinary Regular officer, the existing powers of awarding forfeiture of service and seniority are considered adequate,and reduction to a lower rank, in the case of an officer who had attained his
existing rank after several years service in the rank below by time promotion,would present practical difficulties. This would apply equally to reduction insubstantive rank in war-time. The same difficulty would not arise with actingor temporary ranks under a war-time scheme similar to that at present inforce, but these ranks are surrendered in any event on posting to anotherappointment of a lower grade, and may be regained by selection for a newappointment carrying the higher rank. Any officer holding acting or temporaryrank is thus liable, if he does not give satisfactory service, to be posted awayto a lower appointment and thereby forfeit his rank, while it would be possiblefor an officer, deprived of his rank as a penalty, to regain it very soon if he were needed for an appointment carrying the higher rank. In any case, itwould be difficult to limit this new punishment, if introduced, to acting or temporary rank. Moreover, it cannot be assumed that in a future war thesystem of ranks and promotion would be precisely the same as in the past.It is also felt that, in the Army at any rate, the introduction of this formof punishment might well have an adverse effect on discipline, since the Army&apos;organisation would make it very difficult, if not impossible, to conceal fromthe men under an officers command the fact that he had been punished inthis manner. The regimental and corps structure of the Service places diffi-culties in the way of posting an officer to a unit where he is not already known.In the case of the Royal Air Force this particular objection would have lessforce, and it should be possible to employ in new surroundings an officer whohad been reduced in rank. The Air Ministry representatives, therefore, favour the adoption of the proposal in order to close the gap between dismissal andforfeiture of seniority in the existing scale of punishments for officers.We think it might be very difficult from the political angle to defend theintroduction of this penalty for one Service only when in other respects it isusual for the Army and Air Force Acts to follow parallel lines.Apart from the Air Ministry representatives we conclude, therefore, on thewhole, that it is undesirable and unnecessary to introduce this additionalpunishment for officers.50. Recommendation in paragraph 186 :That there should be no change in commanders&apos; powers other thanthat proposed in paragraph 185.We agree.General Courts-Martial. *. &apos;51. Recommendation in paragraph 197 :That the General Court-Martial should be composed of a Judge Martial,or Deputy Judge Martial, and five officers of at least the rank of lieutenant(or flying officer).We concur in the recommendation in this paragraph. Our proposals inthis and the following paragraphs dealing with reconstitution of courts-martialare, however, subject to our preliminary remarks in paragraphs 3 to 7 above and assume that the fundamental changes recommended by the Lewis Com-mittee will be approved in principle.52. Recommendation in paragraph 198 :That the Judge Martial should be president and act as a judge at anAssize Court. The officers should retire alone to consider their finding ;but the president should retire with them to; decide the sentence, and, ifvotes are equally divided, have a casting vote.We adyise acceptance of this recommendation: With the abolition of con-firmation and review we hold it essential to strengthen the General Court-Martial in the manner proposed. -
That the senior officer should announce the finding in open court inreply to a question by the president. The sentence should be pronouncedin open court by the president as being the sentence of the court. no confirmation should be required, but the sentence should not be put intoeffect until the convening officer has approved it, so as to provide animmediate opportunity for mitigation, remission or commutation.We agree in principle with this recommendation assuming, of course, thatthe recommendation in paragraph 198 is also accepted. We do not consider,however, that the officer approving the sentence should necessarily be the convening officer : in important cases he might well be the Commander-in-Chief.We also consider that in view of the fundamental changes proposed by the lewis Committee, statutory power to convene Courts-Martial should be givento officers prescribed in a Rule of Procedure instead of officers empowered soto do by Court-Martial Warrant. The power to approve sentence could be controlled by administrative action.54. Recommendations in paragraphs 200 to 202 :That an accused should have the right of appeal against finding ;That there should be no change in the jurisdiction and powers ofGeneral Courts-Martial;That a Judge Martial or Deputy Judge Martial sitting as president should be robed as King&apos;s Counsel.We concur in these recommendations, but consider that robing and dressregulations for the Chief Judge Martial&apos;s Department should be a matter forthe Lord Chancellor.District Courts-Martial.A. Lay Presidents.55. Recommendation in paragraph 206 :That Permanent Presidents should preside, save as indicated in para-graphs 207 and 213.In paragraph 207 of their report the Lewis Committee recommend that itshould not be made a rule of law that only an officer holding the appointmentof permanent president should preside over a District Court-Martial, but that,nevertheless, those officers at present eligible to preside should not be appointedunless the convening officer certifies that a permanent president is not avail-able ; and in paragraph 213 it is proposed that an Assistant Judge Martialshould preside over any District Court-Martial assembled to try a serious case.Whilst we agree generally with the arguments which led the Lewis Com-mittee to advise the appointment of permanent presidents, we feel that therules governing their appointment should be framed in such a way as to allow the Services more latitude than is envisaged in the Lewis Committee proposal.The War Office representatives have no objections to the recommendations asthey stand, but the Air Ministry representatives desire to retain the existing system whereby ordinary serving officers are appointed as presidents of DistrictCourts-Martial. In this way they hope to preserve and foster the executive officers knowledge of Service Law. They recognise, however, that even ifthis course is pursued the power to appoint permanent presidents in the R.A.F.will still be necessary, at any rate for a time. The new District Court-Martialto try the less important cases will have no legally qualified president, yet willhave powers up to one year&apos;s imprisonment, and its proceedings, with the
introduction of the Appeal system, will not be subject to review. It is there-fore important that ordinary serving officers should be trained to a high standard of legal knowledge if they are adequately to replace permanentpresidents, and that until that standard is leached lay officers should not normally be appointed as presidents of courts-martial.We therefore recommend that the two Services should be given the per-missive power to appoint permanent presidents, who may be employed as necessary as presidents of District Courts-Martial; and that responsibility should rest with the convening officer with such legal advice as may be avail-able to him for ensuring that a court composed of ordinary serving officers isnot appointed to try a case likely to be beyond its capabilities.56. Recommendation in paragraph 208 :That the jurisdiction of a District Court-Martial not presided over byan Assistant Judge-Martial should be limited to military or air forceoffences for which the maximum punishment prescribed in the Army andAir Force Acts is imprisonment, and to soldiers and airmen below warrantrank. No offence under Section 41 should be triable by a District Court-Martial, so constituted.We advise acceptance of this recommendation, except that in view of the changes introduced by the Criminal Justice Act, 1948, and Orders in Councilto be made thereunder (abolition of penal servitude and hard labour andsubstitution of long-term imprisonment), jurisdiction should be limited tooffences for which the maximum punishment prescribed is two years&apos; imprison-ment.57. Recommendation in paragraph 209 :That the punishment awardable by a District Court-Mai tial, notpresided over by an Assistant Judge Martial, should be restricted to sixmonths&apos; imprisonment for any one offence, with an overriding maximum of 12 months for two or more offences. In a single charge of desertion,the maximum of six months might be extended to twelve months.We advise acceptance of this recommendation.B. Composition of Court.58. Recommendation in paragraph 210 :That two officers should sit with the President, but the qualification of two years&apos; commissioned service should be dispensed with in war-time or when the Court is presided over by a permanent president or an AssistantJudge Martial.We advise acceptance of this recommendation. (In regard to a DistrictCourt-Martial presided over by an Assistant Judge Martial, however, see ourcomment in paragraph 59 below.) &apos;C. Assistant Judge Martial as President.59&apos; Recommendation in paragraph 213 :That the President of a Court to try more serious and difficult cases should be an Assistant Judge Martial appointed ad hoc by the conveningofficer to whom the necessary power should be given. No summing up should be required in these cases, but the President should have an equalvoice with the other members as regards finding and sentence. A con-vening officer should have power to appoint as President any servingofficer who may be.on.the.panel referred to in paragraph 217(6).
&quot;    191We approve this recommendation except that we do not agree that a district Court-Martial with an Assistant Judge Martial presiding should sit asa bench of magistrates and not as a judge and jury. It would seem to usmore consistent that this District Court-Martial should sit as a judge and juryand that the jury should be composed of three Service officers. It may becontended that a jury of three is too small, but we would point out that underthe present system the Court of three retire to consider their finding in their capacity as a jury after they have received a summing up from the judge advocate. We see no reason why they should not continue to do so whenthey have received the summing up from the Judge President. Further, incivil procedure the appeal from Magistrates is to the Appeal Committee ofQuarter Sessions by rehearing and not on a point of law to the Court of criminal appeal. In military procedure it would generally be impracticable to have arehearing, and an appeal on a point of law to the Court-Martial Appeal Courtfrom a conviction where there had been no summing up might deprive the accused of a substantial portion of his grounds for appeal. Where there hasbeen no summing up it is not possible to say whether the Court have mis-directed themselves on a point of law.In these circumstances we feel strongly that in both the General Court-Martial and the District Court-Martial where a Judge President is sitting, the trial should be on the lines of that by judge and jury with a summing up.This would be consistent to the extent that where legal personnel are employed as members of the Court the trials would be conducted on the same basis.It would follow that the Judge President would not retire or vote on the finding but would have a vote and a casting vote on sentence as in the GeneialCourt-Martial.60. Recommendation in paragraph 214 :That the jurisdiction and powers of a District Court-Martial preside over by an Assistant Judge Martial should remain as at present. officers should not be tried by a District Court-Martial.We do not consider that the District Court-Martial presided over by an assistant Judge Martial should have power to try cases of treason, murder,manslaughter, treason-felony, rape or any offence for which the maximumpenalty is death. Subject to this, we consider that this court should havepower to try any offence.As regards power of punishment, we agree to a limit of two years&apos; im-prisonment in peace-time, but on active service, for the reasons stated inparagraph 63 below, we would extend the maximum to thiee years&apos; imprison-ment where the offence carried that or a greater punishment.D. Finding and sentence.61. Recommendations in paragraph 215 :That in all trials by District Court-Martial, whoever may b&apos;e Presi-dent : (a) the finding and sentence should be pronounced in open Court ;(b) the Court should be judge of both law and fact but with a rightof appeal (with leave) against conviction ;(c) the sentence should be reviewed by an authority having power to mitigate, remit or commute, and sentence should not be put intoeffect meanwhile.The recommendation in sub-paragraph (a) has already been put into effect and we recommend acceptance of those in sub-paragraphs (b), subject to therecommendation in the last sub-paragraph of paragraph 59 above, and (c).
2.4Recommendations affecting the reconstituted Courts.62. Recommendations in paragraph 217 :(a) that findings of guilt or innocence should be unanimous, butsentences should continue to be decided by a majority ;(b) that a panel be formed by the Chief Judge Martial, with theapproval of the Lord Chancellor, of practising counsel in theUnited Kingdom willing to act as Presidents of Court-Martial.The selection of a member of this panel to preside to be made bythe Chief Judge Martial or his Deputy.We concur in recommendation (b). Recommendation (a) is considered inparagraph 27 of this report.Emergency Courts-Martial.63. Recommendations in paragraph 220 :(a) that the Field General Court-Martial should be retained but thatits title should be changed to &quot; Emergency Court-Martial&quot; ;(6) that the provisions of the Army Act as to powers to convene aField General Court-Martial, the composition of that Court, andits jurisdiction and powers of punishment, should apply to theEmergency Court-Martial with the qualification that such aCourt should be permitted only when it is not &quot; possible &quot; to convene a General Court-Martial, or a District Court-Martialpresided over by an Assistant Judge-Martial;(c) that its findings and sentence should require the confirmation ofthe senior officer in the vicinity (not being an officer who served on the Court), such officer having power to mitigate, remit orcommute the sentence ;(d) that an accused should have the right of appeal against convictionby submitting an application to the officer commanding his unit,who should forward the application to the Deputy Chief judge martial or, if this is impracticable, to the Chief Judge Martial.If leave is granted, the appeal should be held as soon as circum-stances permit ;(e) that no Emergency Court-Martial be held in peace-time in theUnited Kingdom.We advise acceptance of the recommendation in sub-paragraph (a).As regards the recommendation in sub-paragraph (b), we consider thatthere should be some modification of the Lewis Committee&apos;s proposals. Theiemight well be practical difficulties in the way of accepting the recommendation as it stands. It would no doubt frequently be &quot; possible &quot; to convene a general court-Martial for the trial, say, of a large number of deserters, when at thesame time it might be extremely inconvenient, for example during active operations, to do so, and unreasonable to require it to be done. In order toallow some latitude to convening officers while at the same time reducing thenumber of occasions when a General Court-Martial might be considered necessary, we would recommend : (i) the increase of the powers of the District Court-Martial presided overby an Assistant Judge Martial on active service to three year&apos;simprisonment;
-   1We agree.(ii) the grant of permission to convene an Emergency Court-Martialwhenever the convening of a General Court-Martial or DistrictCourt-Martial presided over by an Assistant Judge Martial is not&quot; reasonably possible &quot; ;(iii) the acceptance of the certificate of the convening officer as to reason-able possibility as conclusive.We advise acceptance of the recommendation in sub-paragraph (c) andfurther recommend that in the case of an Emergency Court-Martial an accusedshould be permitted to submit a Petition in writing to the confirming officerprior to confirmation. This would be in addition to his right to apply forleave to appeal against his conviction after confirmation to the Courts-MartialAppeal Court. This latter right would, of course, be subject to the exceptionreferred to in paragraph 64 below.We also advise acceptance of the recommendations in sub-paragraphs (d)and [e).64. Recommendation in paragraph 221 :That in special cases, for example, sentence of death for treachery,when the interests of discipline and the safety of the force require theimmediate carrying out of that sentence, the convening officer plus thenext two senior officers in the force (who did not sit on the Court-Martial)should consider the validity of the conviction and appropriateness of the sentence. If the conviction be unanimously affirmed and they unani-mously come to the conclusion, to be certified in writing, that the interestsof discipline and the safety of the force require that the sentence shouldbe carried out forthwith, it may be immediately put into execution.We accept the fact that special provision must be made for the immediatecarrying out of sentences in emergency, but we do not agree with the procedure proposed. We consider that in the type of case mentioned, the decision as tothe validity of the conviction and the propriety of the sentence, as well asregarding implementation of the sentence, should rest with the confirmingofficer and should not be the joint responsibility of three officers. The con-firming officer would, of course, be able to consult any other senior officer ifhe wished to do soiWe also recommend that this provision as regards implementation of sen-tence should apply in a case where the sentence has been imposed by a general court-Martial and there is no possibility owing to enemy action of affordingthe accused the opportunity of exercising the right of oral appeal, although inthis case the question of confirmation would not arise.One type of court-martial only.65. Recommendation in paragraph 226 :That a proposal that there should be one type of court-martial onlyshould not be considered.We agree.Other ranks to serve 011 courts-martial.66. Recommendation in paragraph 240 :That a proposal that other lanks should serve as members of courts-martial should not be accepted.
Military magistrates..67. Recommendation in paragraph 254 :That the military magistrates scheme should not be imposed on theServices, but both Services should be given a permissive power to institutethe scheme as an experiment in the first place.We do not see any need for the introduction of military magistrates.   Tosuperimpose this scheme on the recommended system of General, District and emergency Courts-Martial would, in our view, be an unnecessary complication.Functions of the Chief Judge Martial.68. Recommendations in paragraphs 83(c), 109(d), 144, 197 and 213 :That the functions of the Chief Judge Martial be : (a) to supply Judges Martial or Deputy Judges Martial for trials byGeneral Court-Martial (paragraph 197) ;(b) to supply Assistant Judges Martial for the more serious casestried by District Court-Martial (paragraph 213) ;(c) to pieside over the Courts-Martial Appeal Court (paragraph 144) ;(d) to receive and act upon petitions against undue dplay in trialsby Court-Martial (paragraph 83(c)) ;(c) to give advice on questions of law arising-out of Court-Martialproceedings, as does the Judge Advocate General at present(paragraph 109(d)).We agree that the functions of the Chief Judge Martial should be as described in these paragraphs, though the advice referred to in recommendation (e) must,of course, be confined to cases which aie not the subject of oral appeal. TheChief Judge Martial might also give advice on other legal matters by anange-ment between the Lord Chancellor and the Secretaries of State for War andAir.PART HI.-METHOD OF IMPLEMENTATION69. We have considered what steps would be necessary to put into force,by legislation or otherwise, the recommendations of the Lewis Committee,and those of which we have advised acceptance. We indicate our conclusionsbriefly in the Schedule at Appendix A. We think, however, that it would be convenient to set out rather more fully here the principal matters requiringlegislation. It is thought that it would be possible to deal with them, all inthe Army and Air Force (Annual) Bill.(1) The offices of the Chief Judge Martial and his staff.Clauses will be needed dealing, not necessarily in detail, with thestatus, qualification, power of appointment, tenure, salary, retiring age and pension of the Chief Judge Martial, the Vice Chief Judge Martial, the judges Martial and the Assistant Judges Martial.(2) Courts-Martial Appeal Court.A clause will be needed constituting the Courts-Martial Appeal court and dealing with its composition and powers, and providing for an appealto the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in special cases.There would be a provision giving the Lord Chancellor power toappoint a panel of persons willing from time to time to be Deputy JudgesMartial,(a) to preside at Courts-Martial ;(b) to preside or sit in the Appeal Court, as and when required.A clause will be needed abolishing confirmation (except for Emer-gency Courts-Martial) and review of courts-maitial proceedings (except
for persons already convicted before the change takes place), and sub-stituting the right of appeal to the Courts-Martial Appeal Court as froman appointed day to be fixed under the Act (c/. Section 23(3) of the criminal appeal Act, 1907). It is suggested that this day might be 1st January,1950, provided the necessary legislation is passed in the Army and AirForce (Annual) Bill of 1949.Provision will also be necessary for the suspension of the system oforal appeal in emergency, if our recommendation in paragraph 6 is accepted.The consequential alterations in the relevant sections.of the Act could probably be put into a schedule.(3) Reconstitution of Courts-Martial.There would be provisions dealing with : (a) the composition of General Courts-Martial;(b) the jurisdiction of District Courts-Martial according to whether an Assistant Judge Martial is presiding or not;(c) Emergency Courts-Martial.The consequential alterations in the relevant sections of the Act could probably be put in a schedule.(4) Minor amendments.There would be provisions dealing with : (a) the rendering of delay reports and other steps to limit delaysbefore trial;(b) the addition of a new punishment for officers and other ranks,namely, reduction to a penal rate of pay (and reduction inrank for officers if this recommendation were accepted) ; .(c) power for courts-martial to take into account other offencesadmitted by accused ;id) power to determine &quot; active service &quot; by Order in Council or order of Army or Air Council.An early decision will be necessary if these amendments are to form partof the Army and Air Force (Annual) Bill, 1949.70. No doubt it^vill be thought proper that His Majesty should be apprisedof the extent to which his Prerogative or Statutory Powers in relation to the trial and punishment of persons subject to military or air force law will beaffected by any alteration of the law and procedure which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment proposes to introduce.71.

1REPORTINTRODUCTIONI. We were constituted as a Committee by War Office letter dated 4thNovember, 1946, with the following terms of reference:  &quot; To bring under review in the light of the experience gained in thelate war and of the composition of the Army and the Royal Air Force,the recommendations of the Army and Air Force Courts-Martial Com-mittee, 1938 (Cmd. 6200) with special reference to the question whether. it is desirable to provide any, and if so what, form of appeal from the findings or sentences of courts-martial; to investigate the powers of courts-martial and of commanding officers to award punishment and the nature and scale of such punishment; and to make recommendations upon these and kindred matters &quot;.The members of the Committee were:. The Hon. Mr. Justice Lewis, O.B.E. (Chairman).Air Marshal Sir Philip Babington, K.C.B., M.C., A.F.C.Mr. A. R. Blackburn, M.P.Major-General the Viscount Bridgeman, C.B., D.S.O., M.C.Mr. Terence Donovan, K.C., M.P.Sir Theobald Mathew, K.B.E., M.C.Mr. J. C. Maude, K.C., M.P.Brigadier R. A. F. Thorp, O.B.E., M.P.Joint Secretaries:Colonel W. R. F. Osmond, O.B.E. (War Office).Group Captain E. H. Hooper, C.B.E. (Air Ministry).Lieutenant-Colonel R. J. H. de Brett (War Office).2. We sat on 37 occasions, examined 57 witnesses, and studied upwards of200 memoranda submitted to us. The names of witnesses, and persons and organisations who submitted memoranda, will (with the exceptions indicatedbelow) be found in Appendices A and B respectively to this Report. Wearranged that all ranks in the Army and Royal Air Force should be made aware that the Committee was sitting, and should be invited to send direct to us any suggestions they had to make.. It was made clear that the names of those responding, to such invitation, and subsequently giving evidence before us in support of their suggestions, would be treated in confidence;and for this reason only their names are not given in Appendices A and B.46 officers and 17 other ranks of the Army and the Royal Air Force sentin memoranda in response to such invitation, and of these, 2 officers and4 other ranks attended the Committee and gave oral evidence.3. For the great help afforded by all those who submitted memoranda,and all those who gave evidence before us, whether they had previouslysubmitted a memorandum or not, the Committee desires to express itsgrateful thanks.4. In addition to the meetings of the full Committee, 12 meetings were held of a Drafting Sub-Committee. consisting of the Chairman, the ViscountBridgeman, Mr. Terence Donovan and Sir Theobald Mathew.(29542) B

The terms of reference of the Army and Air Force Courts-martial committee, 1938, presided over by Mr. Roland Oliver, M.C., K.C., nowMr. Justice Oliver (which Committee is hereinafter referred to as the OliverCommittee) were as follows:  &quot; To examine the existing system of trial by court-martial under theArmy and Air Force Acts, and matters incidental thereto, and in par-ticular to consider whether it is desirable and practicable that a personconvicted by court-martial should have the right of appeal to a civiljudicial tribunal against his conviction, and to make recommendations &quot;.6. It will be seen that the terms of reference of the present Committeewere wider than those of the Oliver Committee. We have had to considerwhether any form of appeal (i.e., not merely to a civil judicial tribunal)should be granted; and whether it should be granted not only against con-viction by a court-martial, but also against its sentence. We have also hadto review the nature and scale of punishment which courts-martial andcommanding officers have power respectively to award. Furthermore, whilethe Committee was sitting, Parliament approved the principle of compulsory military service in peace-time, and Royal Assent to the National Service Actwas given on 18th July, 1947.7. In future, therefore, large numbers of citizens will join the Forcesin peace-time whether they wish to or not, and we have had to bear thisalways in mind in considering the judicial machinery best suited to the Armyand the Royal Air Force. It is no longer true to say that every memberof the Forces has, after all, voluntarily submitted himself to the existing system with any imperfections it may have a consideration which (quiteproperly at the time) influenced the Oliver Committee.8. We would observe that whereas the Oliver Committee was concernedlargely with experience gained over a period of some 20 years entirelyunder peace conditions, the evidence given before us related almost exclusively to war-time conditions.9. At this new point in the history of the Forces, it seemed to us thatit would be more helpful to those.who have to consider our recommendations and to take decisions upon them, if we made our Report as comprehensiveas possible; and we have accordingly included a short history of the court-martial system, and of the office of the Judge Advocate General, which provides a useful background against which to view the present position.10. We now have the honour to present our Report which is arranged asfollows:  Chapter     I Short History of the Court-Martial System and of theOffice of Judge Advocate General.Chapter   II-The Present Types of Courts-Martial and their Procedure.Chapter III Alleged Defects in the Present System.The Committee&apos;s Observations and Recommendations.   &quot;Chapter IV Appeals.Chapter    V Punishments:Chapter VI Courts-Martial for the Future.The Committee&apos;s Observations and Recommendations.Chapter VII Summary of Recommendations and Conclusion.
19CHAPTER ISHORT HISTORY OF THE COURT-MARTIAL SYSTEM AND OF THEOFFICE OF JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERALII. The soldier (a term which we use in this context to include corn-missioned officers as well as other ranks in the Army and airmen in theRoyal Air Force) notwithstanding his membership of the Forces, is still a citizen; and as such he continues to be entitled both to the protection of theordinary civil law and to be subject to its authority. The tasks which he maybe called upon to perform as a soldier, however, and the circumstances underwhich such tasks may have to be performed, call for a high degree of discipline; and the maintenance of such discipline in turn requires a specialcode of law to define the soldier&apos;s duty and to prescribe punishment for breaches of it. The civil law grants the remedy of damages in a case wherea servant leaves his master&apos;s employment without proper notice; but such a remedy would hardly avail to prevent desertion from the Forces. Disobedienceto the orders of a superior is not, in civil life, normally a criminal offence,but such disobedience in the Forces may be an offence of great gravity,imperilling the lives of many men and calling for exemplary punishment. Inorder to maintain the efficiency of a fighting force and the discipline upon&apos; which such efficiency depends, it has, therefore, always been recognised thata special code of military law is necessary. Yet it was not until the eighteenthcentury that such necessity was expressly recognised by Parliament and statutory authority given for the infliction by military tribunals of punishment for certain military offences.12. The reason was that the making of war formed part of the King&apos;sPrerogative, and in exercise of that Prerogative the King raised and employedtroops for particular wars or rebellions. The rules of conduct which suchtroops were required to observe, together with the punishments for their non-observance, were, in further exercise of the Prerogative, prescribed inOrdinances known as Articles of War, which ceased to have effect as soon asthe particular Army in respect of which they were issued was disbanded.13. Thus, in 1629, Charles I issued Articles of War &quot; for the governmentand good ordering of the troops in England either in an army, or in regiments,or in single companies &quot; and followed this up with further codes upon thesame subject in 1639 and 1642. After the Restoration, Parliament allowedCharles II to maintain at his own cost troops called &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Guardsand Garrisons &quot; which ultimately developed into the standing army. Forthe government of these troops Charles II issued orders and Articles of Warin 1662, 1666 and 1672. In 1686, on the rebellion of Monmouth, James IIalso issued Articles of War for his Army.14. These various codes defined the duties of the soldier and prescribedpunishments for offences. Such punishments were severe. In the Articlesof War of 1642, for example, death was the punishment prescribed byforty-three of the Articles for various offences, and the lesser punishmentsincluded imprisonment, burning the tongue with a hot iron, and flogging.15. The tribunal which in the earliest times administered the militarycode and had jurisdiction over the soldier as such, was the Court ofChivalry a Court which on its civil side was a Court of Honour dealingwith matters relating to coats of arms, precedence, etc., and which in timeof war had, jurisdiction over all military offences.     The Judges were the(29542) B 2
Lord High Constable, who was the King&apos;s General, and the Earl Marshal,whose duty it was to muster the Army. Thus the Court came to be knownas the Court of the Constable and Marshal, and it is from the Marshal thatCourts-Martial derive their name. During the reign of Henry VIII, the duke of Buckingham, who was then Lord High Constable, was attaintedand executed, and no other person has since been permanently appointed tothe office. The practice was then instituted of the King granting commissions to the Commander-in-Chief, authorising him to hold courts for the trial ofmilitary offences. These Courts came to be known as Councils of War andalso as Marshals Courts or Courts-Martial. Thus the Articles of War of 1666established &quot; for the better administration of justice &quot; a General Court-Martial for offences punishable with life or limb; Regimental Courts for lesseroffences and &quot; Detachment &quot; with&apos;the powers of Regimental Courts.16. Upon the abdication of James II, followed by the mutiny of certainScottish regiments bound by their oath to his service, it became necessaryfor Parliament to intervene in order to constrain the Army to allegiance toWilliam III. The first Mutiny Act was accordingly passed in 1689. Itdeclared the necessity while the Army was on duty of &quot; retaining an exactdiscipline &apos;&apos; and it went on to enact:  &quot; that every person mustered and in pay as an officer or soldier in theKing&apos;s Army found guilty by Court-Martial of exciting, causing orjoining in any mutiny or sedition or of desertion from the Army shouldsuffer death or such other punishment as that&apos;Court should award &quot;.The effect of this Act, says Clode, in his work on Military and martial law (2nd Edition, 1874, PaSe 21), was &quot; to leave all ordinary &apos; military &apos;&quot; offences to be dealt with&apos; as heretofore by the Crown alone, but to give&quot; Parliamentary sanction to the infliction of Capital Punishment for certain&quot; specified offences which, whether regarded as Military or Political, it was&quot; expedient should be summarily punished by Courts-Martial &quot;.17. The Act proceeded to give authority to the King, or to the Generalof the Army, to grant his Warrant to officers not under the rank of Colonelto convene Courts-Martial from time to time for the punishment of offenders.The Act was limited to an experimental period of seven months, but was-enacted from year to year (with the exception of a few short intervalsonly) from 1689 to I789, being constantly amended and expanded. Until1803, when the prerogative power was superseded by a correspondingstatutory power, the Crown continued to make Articles of War by virtueof its Prerogative; but they were valid only so far as consistent with thecurrent Mutiny Act.18. In 1879, me Articles of War and the Mutiny Act were consolidated inone Statute the Army Discipline and Regulation Act. Two years later this was replaced by the Army Act of 1881, from which Act Courts-Martialnow derive their jurisdiction. The Army Act requires, however, to be broughtinto operation annually by a separate Act of Parliament, and this was donedown to 1920 by the Army (Annual) Act. In 1920, consequent upon theformation in 1918 of the Royal Air Force, the title of the Act was alteredto &quot; The Army and Air Force (Annual) Act &quot;. This Act brings into forceboth the Army Act and the Air Force Act, the latter corresponding in theRoyal Air Force to the Army Act with modifications not material for present purposes.19. The power to convene General Courts-Martial is still by statute (seeSections 48 and 122-3 of the Army Act) exclusive to His Majesty or to some person deriving authority from him.
.20. The Articles of 1639 issued by Charles I gave authority &quot; to theCouncil of War and the Advocate of the Army to enquire of the actors and circumstances of offences committed by the oaths of such and so many &quot; asthey thought convenient using &quot; all means for examination and trial ofpersons delated, suspected, or defamed &quot;-zi. The Orders issued in 1662 by Charles II for the regulation of HisMajesty&apos;s Guards and Garrisons gave authority to the General to constituteCourts-Martial and to the &quot; Judge Advocate of the Forces &quot; to take informa-tion and depositions as occasion should require in all matters triable beforeCourt-Martial.22. By the code of 1666, referred to in paragraph 13, the &quot; judge advocate &quot; was required to attend General Courts-Martial, summon witnessesand administer oaths: and in the Articles of War of 1672 it was providedthat in criminal cases affecting the Crown the &quot; Judge Advocate General &quot;had to inform and prosecute on behalf of the Crown.23. In Turner&apos;s Pallas Armata, written in 1671, if is said that it wasthe duty of the &quot; Judge Advocate &quot;&quot; to inform the Court-Martial what the Civil or Municipal Law provides,that the Military might not infringe upon the jurisdiction of the civil courts &quot;.24. From 1689, the Judge Advocate General acted as legal adviser in all matters to the Commander-in-Chief. He and his deputies advised on thecharges and the evidence in criminal cases of difficulty before a Court-Martial was convened. The Judge Advocate also attended General Courts-Martial both as a prosecutor and as a legal adviser to the Court.25. This combination of duties came to be regarded as undesirable, andthe Judge Advocate gradually ceased to act as prosecutor. It was not,however, until i860 that Articles of War provided that the Judge Advocateshould no longer be the prosecutor. Yet no alternative arrangements forthe prosecution of serious cases were provided, and the Judge advocate general as legal adviser to the Commander-in-Chief continued to arrangefor the proper conduct of such prosecutions. He also reviewed all courts-martial proceedings for the purpose of advising the Commander-in-Chiefwhether they were free of legal error.26. For nearly a century before 1893, the Judge Advocate General wasa Privy Councillor, a member of the Government and usually a Member ofParliament. He had direct access to the Sovereign on matters pertaining tohis Office. In 1893, the office ceased to be a political appointment and washeld continuously from that year until 1905 by the President of the Probate,Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court. In 1905, on a newappointment having to be made, it was decided that the office should infuture be filled by a person of suitable legal attainments, who should, how-ever, be subject to the orders of the Secretary of State for War. The appoint-ment is made by the King under Letters Patent.27. At the present day the Judge Advocate General of the Forces is responsible for the following functions:  (a) The supervision of the Military and Air Force Departments of his office, the main duties of which include that of advising andassisting convening officers of both services upon questions arising in the preparation of cases for trial by courts-martial, prosecuting
thereat when required, safeguarding the interests of accusedpersons, advising General and Air Officers upon questions arisingas to summary&apos; jurisdiction under section 47 of the Army andAir Force Acts, and upon questions in connection with courts of inquiry, providing members of such courts in special cases,- and instruction in Military and Air Force Law.(6) The provision of a &quot; Judge Advocate &quot; at all trials by General Court-Martial held in the United Kingdom and at the more seriouseases tried by District Courts-Martial. Pursuant to his Letters-Patent he also appoints judge advocates for important trialsabroad by General or Field General Courts-Martial. The judge advocate attends the court in an advisory capacity and as therepresentative of the Judge Advocate General.(c) The superintendence of the administration of Military and Air ForceLaw in the Army and Royal Air Force respectively. The reviewof the proceedings of all courts-martial with a view to seeing whether they have been regular and legal, including the tenderingof legal advice on confirmation or review or on petition. In theevent of- it being necessary to quash proceedings, the judge advocate General makes recommendations to the appropriateSecretary of State or Commander-in-Chief with this object. He. . is the custodian of the proceedings of all courts-martial.. He assistseach Secretary of State in the formulation of any advice it may benecessary to give the Sovereign regarding the proceedings of courts-martial.(d) Advice to the Secretaries of State for War and Air and to Com-manders at home and abroad on general legal questions affectingthe Army and the Royal Air Force.28. The Judge Advocate General has Deputies and Staffs with the majorArmy and Air Force Commands abroad.29. In practice, the duties under (a) above are kept entirely separate inthe Judge Advocate General&apos;s Office in London, and, so far as possible, arekept separate in Commands overseas.30. The title &quot; judge advocate &quot; with its suggestion of completely oppositefunctions being performed by the same individual is curious and misleading.It may lead an accused to think that the judge advocate is not only a legal adviser to the court, but an advocate for the prosecution as well. the explanation of the title may lie in the description given, in 1864, by LordCranworth of the duties of the judge advocate (173 H.D. (3), page 1174). Hecalls him the &quot; &apos; Judex Adyocatus &apos;, a Judge called to assist the Courtthough forming no constituent part of it The term &quot; advocate &quot; maythus be a corruption of &quot; Advocatus &quot; used in Lord Cranworth&apos;s sense.31. Upon the creation of the Royal Air Force in 1918, the Judge AdvocateGeneraTs functions were extended to that Service and the present judge advocate General&apos;s Letters Patent from the Crown granted in 1934 specificallyinclude both the Army and the Royal Air force.32. In addition to the normal functions indicated above, the judge advocate General has been made responsible for the collection of evidenceagainst and the prosecution of war criminals in Europe and the Far Eastfor trial before Military Courts constituted by Royal Warrant (Army Order81/1945). He is also responsible for the provision of judge advocates at these trials when required, and for the review of proceedings and advice on
petitions. The Judge Advocate General is head of the United KingdomNational Office of the United Nations War Crimes Commission. Similarresponsibilities devolve upon the Judge Advocate General in connection withthe trials of Prisoners of War by Military Court under the Royal Warrantof 1939, and Regulations for the Maintenance of Discipline Among Prisonersof War.. These important commitments are abnormal and will lapse in due course.CHAPTER IITHE PRESENT TYPES OF COURTS-MARTIAL AND THEIRPROCEDURE33. References to the Army and Royal Air Force. The disciplinary codesof the Army and the Royal Air Force are materially the same, being basedupon the Army Act and the Air Force Act respectively, but in order to avoidconstant reference to the two codes and to the different ranks and terms in use in the two Services we have, as a general rule, confined ourselves,hereinafter in this Report, to Army terminology. It should, therefore, be understood that our references, to the military legal and regulational provisions and military ranks and authorities apply generally, mutatis mutandis, to theirRoyal Air Force equivalents unless otherwise stated. For example, the term-&quot; soldier &quot; should be read as including &quot; airman &quot;, and army ranks as including the relative ranks in the Royal Air Force.34. There are at present three types of court-martial in the Army and theRoyal Air Force, namely a General Court-Martial, a District Court-Martialand a Field General Court-Martial.35. A General Court-Martial must consist of at least five officers, eachof whom must have held a commission during not less than three years,and one of whom acts as president of the court. The president, who must benamed in the Order convening the court-martial, is never below the rank offield officer save exceptionally where no such officer is available. Not lessthan four members of the court must be of the rank of captain or above.A General Court-Martial may try both officers and other ranks.36. A District Court-Martial consists of at least three officers, each of whommust have held a commission during not less than two years, and one ofwhom acts as president of the court. Again the president must not be underthe rank of field officer unless no such officer is available. Normally, notmore than one member of the court is a subaltern. A District Court-Martialmay try warrant officers, non-commissioned officers and other ranks but maynot try an officer.37. A Field General Court-Martial may be convened when it is not practicable, to convene a General Court-Martial. This is normally coincidentwith active service. It consists, as a rule, of at least three officers, one ofwhom acts as president of the court. The president is normally a field officerunless such an officer is not available. The members of the court shouldhave held commissions for not less than one year, but if officers are availablewho have held commissions for not less than three years they are to be selected in preference to officers of less service. Exceptionally, i.e., if threeofficers are not available, the Field General Court-Martial may consist of twoofficers only, in which case, however, its powers of punishment are limited.
38. Each one of the three types of courts-martial has jurisdiction in respectof the offences specified in Sections 4 to 40 of the Army Act, that is to say,offences committed by persons subject to military law, the disciplinary codeessential in the Armed Forces. These may for convenience be called&quot; military offences &quot;.39. In addition, each of these courts has jurisdiction in respect of all other offences which are punishable by the ordinary law of England and which,when committed by persons subject to military law, are offences under theArmy Act. (See in this connection Section 41 of the Army Act.) These mayfor convenience, and to distinguish them from the military offences above referred to, be called &quot; civil offences &quot;.40. No court-martial can, however, try the offences of treason, murder,manslaughter, treason-felony or rape committed in the United, Kingdom.Nor can it try those five excepted offences if. they are committed in any place within His Majesty&apos;s Dominions other than the United Kingdom and gibraltar, unless the offence was committed when the offender was on active service, or the place where the offence was committed is more than one hundred miles distant from a city or town which has a civil court of com-petent jurisdiction.41. An officer under the rank of captain may not be a member of aGeneral Court-Martial for the trial of a field officer.42. A General Court-Martial can award the punishments of death, penal servitude and imprisonment. A District Court-Martial cannot award a sentence higher than two years&apos; imprisonment with or without hard labour.A Field General Court-Martial composed of three officers can award the samepunishment as a General Court-Martial.43. In the succeeding paragraphs we give a short account of how persons are brought before courts-martial and the procedure at the trial. (A more detailed account will be found by those interested in the Manuals of MilitaryLaw and of Air Force Law, published by the Stationery Office.)44. Persons subject to military law charged with an offence under theArmy Act may be taken into military custody, i.e., placed in open or closearrest. Open arrest means that the person arrested (hereinafter called the accused) may not leave the precincts of the barracks or camp but may berequired to perform all duties. Speaking generally, close arrest, if the accusedis an officer, warrant officer or non-commissioned officer, normally means thathe is placed under the escort of another officer or warrant officer or non-commissioned officer of the same rank, if possible, and may not leave hisquarters except to take exercise under supervision. Close arrest, if the accused is a private soldier, means confinement under the charge of a guard.45. The first step after the accused is taken into military custody is forhis alleged offence to be investigated by his commanding officer. For thispurpose the person who ordered the arrest, or the commander of the guardwho received the accused into confinement, as the case may be, must makea report to the commanding officer within twenty-four hours of the event.46. The commanding officer must then investigate the matter himself, inthe presence of the accused. At this investigation oral evidence will be givenby witnesses of the facts alleged to constitute the offence. The accused mayask questions of such witnesses, and may call witnesses on his own behalf.At this stage no witness, whether for or against the accused, is sworn.
- 47- At the end of this investigation the commanding officer., according tothe view he has formed, will either(a) dismiss the case; or(b) in the case of a non-commissioned officer or private soldier awardsummary punishment within the limit of his powers; or(c) in the case of an officer below the rank of lieutenant-colonel orsquadron leader, or in the case of a warrant officer, refer thecharge to a superior officer to be dealt with summarily by him; or(d) remand the case for trial by court-martial.48. In the case of a non-commissioned officer, the commanding officercannot award summarily punishments other than &quot; stoppages &quot;, severereprimand, reprimand, or admonition. In the case of a private soldierfurther punishments can be awarded summarily (which are detailed else wherein this Report) some of which involve forfeiture of pay. If such a forfeitureis involved, the private soldier may elect to be tried by District Court-Martial.He may also so elect if the commanding officer proposes to deal with the offence otherwise than by awarding minor punishment. &quot;Minor punishment&quot;is defined by King&apos;s Regulations (paragraph 587) as briefly confinement tobarracks up to 14 days, extra guards and picquets, and admonition.49. Assuming that the commanding officer remands the case for trial by court-martial, or the accused, when he may do so, elects to be so tried,the case is adjourned for a &quot;Summary of Evidence &quot; to be taken.50. A Summary of Evidence is a written statement of the evidenceresembling in many ways, the depositions taken at a Magistrate^ Court. Itschief purpose is to give to the accused, the commanding officer, the conveningofficer (i.e., the officer who may in due course have to convene the court-martial) and to . the president of any court-martial so convened, particulars of the evidence in respect of the charge or charges. The commanding officermay himself prepare the Summary of Evidence or appoint some other officer to do so. Witnesses are examined in the presence of the accused, and if the accused so requires or the commanding officer so directs, the examinationis on oath. The evidence is taken down in writing by the officer in chargeof the proceedings, and read over to each witness at the end of his evidence.The witness then signs the statement. The accused has the right personally to cross-examine any witness and may call witnesses on his own behalf.He is not, however, entitled to be legally represented at the taking of the summary of Evidence. After all the evidence in support of the chargehas been given and.taken down, the accused is cautioned and told that hemay make a statement or give evidence on oath. If he does so, he cannotbe cross-examined on any such statement or evidence.51. When the Summary of Evidence is completed it is considered againby the commanding officer who, notwithstanding that he had previouslyremanded the case with the intention of applying for trial by court-martial,may now, if he thinks that course unnecessary, himself re-hear the case, and either dismiss it or dispose of it summarily by awarding a punishment within his powers, unless the accused has elected to be tried by court-martial. If,after considering the Summary of Evidence, the commanding officer remains of the opinion that a court-martial is required, or if it is a case where the accused has himself required such a trial, the commanding officer forwardsa statement of the charge or charges and the Summary of Evidence to anofficer authorised, either mediately or immediately by the King&apos;s Warrant,to convene a General or District Court-Martial, or empowered under the army act to convene a Field General Court-Martial (i.e., the convening officer) atthe same time applying for a court-martial to be convened.   Copies of the(29542) c
charge or charges, and of the Summary of Evidence are furnished to the accused, who must be given proper facilities for preparing his defence,communicating with his witnesses and legal adviser or defending officer, andprocuring the attendance at the trial of any witness that he may require.The defending officer is an officer, who may or may not be legally qualified,selected by the accused or assigned to him by the convening officer indefault of a civilian solicitor or counsel.52. In the case of an officer no Summary of Evidence is necessary unlessthe accused so desires; otherwise, an abstract of the evidence, not prepared in the presence of the accused, takes the place of the Summary of Evidence.53. The convening officer, upon receipt of the documents above referredto, must satisfy himself that the charge or charges against the accused sub-mitted by the commanding officer constitute an offence or offences underthe Army Act and are framed in conformity with the Rules of Proceduremade under that Act. He must also satisfy himself that the Summary orAbstract of Evidence, as the case may be, discloses sufficient admissibleevidence to justify trial by court-martial upon the charge or charges. If heis in doubt upon these matters, he may seek advice from the MilitaryDepartment of the Judge Advocate General at home, or from his Deputyabroad. Subject to being satisfied, however, upon the foregoing matters,the convening officer orders a court-martial to assemble at a stated time and place which may, according to the circumstances, be a General Court-Martial,a District Court-Martial, or a Field General Court-Martial.54. At the time and place specified in such order the court-martial willassemble. Each member of the court is sworn to administer justice withoutpartiality, favour or affection. The court-martial sits in public, but has aninherent power to sit in camera if it considers this course is necessary for theproper administration of justice.55. At the commencement of the trial the accused is brought before thecourt, and after the order convening the court is read, he is asked whether he objects to the president or any member of the court and, if so, the grounds of his objection. If any such objection is made, the court considers it and either allows or disallows it. If the objection is to the president of the court and is allowed, the court adjourns for the purpose of another president being appointed. If the objection is to another member of the court and is allowed,the member in question retires and his place is taken by another officer in attendance as a &quot; waiting member &quot;. Should no such waiting officer be present, the court will adjourn for an officer to be appointed in the place ofthe officer to whom objection has been successfully taken. If no objection is raised the trial proceeds, the charges being read to the accused. In relationto each charge he is asked whether he is guilty or not guilty.56. If the accused pleads guilty to all the charges against him, that pleais recorded as the finding of the court, except in cases where death may bethe sentence for the offence. In such a case a plea of &quot; Guilty &quot; is rejectedand a plea of &quot; Not guilty &quot; recorded. Before recording a finding in accord-ance with the plea of&quot; Guilty &quot;, the president must ascertain that the accusedunderstands the nature of the charge against him and the effect of his pleaand must advise him to withdraw his plea if it appears from the Summaryof Evidence that the accused ought to plead &quot; Not guilty &quot;.57. If the accused pleads &quot; Not guilty &quot; to all or some of the charges,he is asked whether he desires to apply for an adjournment on the groundseither that any of the Rules of Procedure relating to procedure before trial
have not been complied with and that he has been prejudiced thereby, or that he has not had sufficient opportunity to prepare his defence. Thecourt considers any such application, and may grant an adjournment inits discretion if it thinks proper. Assuming no such application is made,or is made and rejected, the trial of those charges to which a plea of &quot; Notguilty &quot; has been entered begins by the prosecuting officer making an opening address, calling his witnesses, who are examined, and may be cross-examined by the accused.58. At the conclusion of the evidence of the prosecution the accused istold by the president that he may give evidence himself, subject to hisliability to be cross-examined, and is asked whether he wishes to give evidencehimself or call witnesses on his behalf; and the subsequent procedure depends upon the accused&apos;s answers to these questions&quot;.59. If he desires to give evidence himself, but to call no witnesses asto the facts, he then gives such evidence, and, if he wishes to do so, may call evidence as to his character. When all such evidence has been taken,the prosecutor may make a final address, after which the accused may makea closing address in his defence.60. If the accused desires to give evidence himself, and to call otherwitnesses as to the facts, he may first make an opening address in his defence.He then gives evidence and calls his other witnesses as to the facts, andalso witnesses as to character if he so desires. When all such evidence hasbeen taken, he may make a closing address in his defence, to which the prosecution may reply.61. If the accused is represented by counsel or by an officer subject to military law, the opening and closing addresses for the defence above referredto are made by such representative.62. There are some variations in this procedure if the accused does not give evidence himself, and if, while not giving evidence himself, he callsother witnesses as to the facts. In these cases the procedure also varies alittle according to whether the accused is legally represented or not. It is unnecessary to detail these variations here: they will be found in Rules ofProcedure 40 and 41 made under the authority of Section&apos;70 of the Army Act.63. The judge advocate, if one is present, then sums up the evidence,and advises the court upon the law relating to the case. The summing-upmust be impartial, but the judge advocate is entitled, if he thinks fit, to comment on the failure of the accused to give evidence. There is nothing to prevent the judge advocate from indicating his own view as to the trueconclusions to be drawn from the evidence, but he is expected to make itclear to the court that the finding is entirely the court&apos;s responsibility.64. The court is then closed for consideration of the finding, the judge advocate being present with members of the court. Each member muststate his opinion as to the finding he thinks proper upon each charge, the junior officer stating, his opinion first, then the next senior and so on. Amajority of votes suffices for any finding, but if the court should be an evennumber and the votes are equally divided, the accused is acquitted. Thepresident has no casting vote in such a case. A finding of &quot; Not guilty &quot;is announced at once in open court, and if this finding applies to all thecharges the accused is released.65. A finding of &quot; Guilty &quot; upon any charge is not so announced. Thecourt is reopened and evidence heard as to the character, age, service andmilitary record of the accused. The witnesses giving this evidence can becross-examined by the accused, and he himself can call witnesses as to his(29542) C 2
1-4good character at this stage, such witnesses, however, being subject to cross-examination by the prosecution. After any such evidence has been taken the accused, or his counsel or defending officer, may address the court inmitigation of punishment. The court is then closed for consideration of sentence. When announcing that the court is being closed for this purpose,the president states that the finding and sentence, being subject to confirma-tion, will not be announced but will be promulgated later and that theproceedings in open court are accordingly terminated. (Note. certain changes have recently been introduced into the procedure described in this and the preceding paragraph as a result of interim recommendations made bythe Committee.   We deal with the matter in Chapter III.)66. Each member of the court must give his opinion separately on the sentence to be awarded, (even though he may have previously voted in favourof an acquittal) and such opinions are taken in succession beginning with the junior member of the court. A majority of the court determines the sentence:but no person may be sentenced to death unless, in the case of a general court-Martial there is a two-thirds majority in favour, or in the case of aField General Court-Martial the vote is unanimous.67. It is the duty of the judge advocate to take an adequate record ofthe proceedings at any court-martial if one is present, and the duty of thepresident to do so if one is not. At the conclusion of the trial this recordis then forwarded to the superior officer having power to confirm the findingand sentence. In the case of a District Court-Martial this will be an officerauthorised to convene a General Court-Martial or another officer whom hehas authorised to confirm the proceedings of a District Court-Martial. In thecase of a General Court-Martial the confirming authority is His Majesty in person or an officer whom His Majesty has authorised mediately or immedi-ately to perform the duty of confirmation. This will normally be the GeneralOfficer Commanding-in-Chief a Command or an Army in the Field; or a group Commander in the Royal Air Force. In the case of a District or aField General Court-Martial it will usually be the officer who convened thecourt. In the Army such officer is not usually below the rank of Brigadier,and in the Royal Air Force not usually below the rank of Air Commodore.68. The confirming officer may either confirm the finding or sentence, ordirect the reassembly of the court for the purpose of revising their findingor sentence or both, or refer the record of the proceedings to a superiormilitary authority competent to confirm, or seek legal advice from the judge advocate General or one of his deputies before confirming himself. He may also himself mitigate, remit or commute the sentence and, in some cases,suspend it.69. The finding and sentence as they stand after confirmation are pro-mulgated to the accused in such manner as the confirming authority directs,or, if no direction is given, according to the custom of the Service. It is usually done by oral communication to the accused, and not, as formerly, onparade. The officer confirming the sentence is also responsible for seeing thatarrangements are made for its being carried into effect.70. The record of the proceedings of all courts-martial are finally forwarded to the Judge Advocate General in London, by whom they are carefullyreviewed to ensure that no irregularity or miscarriage of justice has occurred.If the Judge Advocate General comes to the opinion that an irregularity ormiscarriage of justice has occurred, he so advises the Secretary of State forWar or Air, as the case may be, who has power to quash the proceedings.
71. There is at present no right of appeal to a higher court against either the finding or the sentence of a&apos; court-martial, but any officer or soldier whoso desires can submit a petition against the finding or sentence, or both, of acourt-martial to any confirming or reviewing authority including His Majesty.(As to &quot; reviewing authorities &quot; see Section 57 (2) of the Army Act). Thereis no limit to the number of petitions which can be so presented, nor arethey subject to any time bar.72. The cases of those persons duly convicted by court-martial and servingsentences of penal servitude, imprisonment or detention are periodicallyreviewed by the Army and Air Force authorities having power to mitigate,remit or commute the sentence.73. The following tables show the number of courts-martial of all threetypes held during the years 1st September, 1938 to 31st August, 1946,inclusive in the Army and in the Royal Air Force respectively in relation tbthe strengths of these Forces. At the present time the number of courts-martial of all kinds being held is about 15,000 in the Army and about 2,000in the Royal Air Force per annum.ARMYStrength of Army (Including Royal Marines When Subject toArmy Act)date at HomeAbroadTotalSep.,Sep.,Sep.,Sep.,Sep.,Sep.,Sep.,Sep.,Sep.,193819391940194119421943194419451946102,789127,9171,704,0451.913,6211,816,9011,563,068984,2121,220,489390,55784,97896,271154.697352.995660,7081.154.9771,782,5991,640,134622,124187,767224,1881,858,7422,266,6162,477,6092,718,0452,766,8112,860,6231,012,681Number of Courts-MartialPeriod	At Home	Abroad	Total	Average number per 1,000 personnel1 Sep., 1938 to 31 Aug., 1939 ...	1,178	945   &apos;.	2,123	10.31 Sep., 1939 to 31 Aug., 1940 ...	3.795	2,945	6,740	6-51 Sep., 1940 to 31 Aug., 1941 ...	23.376	2.137	25.513	12-41 Sep., 1941 to 31 Aug., 1942 ...	26,866	5.837	32,703	13-31 Sep., 1942 to 31 Aug., 1943 ...	23,110	11,829	34.939.	13-11 Sep., 1943 to 31 Aug., 1944 ...	21,545	15.238	36.783	I3&quot;4   .1 Sep., 1944 to 31 Aug., 1945 ...	17.843	31.270	49,113	17-51 Sep., 1945 to 31 Aug., 1946 ...	10,094	M.176	24,270	16-9These figures relate only to Army personnel.

We now come to criticisms which have been made to us of theexisting court-martial system. They fail into four broad categories,namely:  (1) Delays before trial;(2) Insufficiency of legal aid both before and during trial;(3) Defects in procedure;(4) Insufficient right of appeal against conviction or sentence, or both,and in particular the lack of right to a hearing.We will deal with these criticisms in the same order, reserving a separatechapter for the subject of Appeals.
* .7, -    202Delays Before Trial75. The Army and Air Force (Annual) Act declares (as did the firstMutiny Act of 1689) that it is requisite that soldiers committing offencesshould be brought to a more exemplary and speedy punishment than the usualforms of law will allow.76. Section 45 (1) of the Army Act provides that where an officer orsoldier remains in military custody for longer than 8 days without a court-martial for his trial being ordered to assemble, a special report of the necessityfor further delay is to be made by his commanding officer &quot; in manner- prescribed &quot;: and a further similar report every eight days thereafter untilthe court-martial is assembled, or the officer or soldier released from custody.77. The Rules of Procedure provide, by Rule 1, that this special report isto be made by letter from the commanding officer to the general or otherofficer to whom application would be made to convene a court-martial forthe trial of the officer or soldier concerned.78. Section 45(1) of the Army Act has no application, however, wherethe officer of soldier who has been taken into military custody is on active service: and in such a case the special report above referred to is not required.And even in those cases where it is required, and is made, the Army Actlays no express duty upon the general or other officer receiving it to take any special steps to terminate the delay. It appears to be assumed that hewill do all in his power to this end as part of his ordinary duty.79. Section 21(1) of the Army Act provides that every person subject to military law who unnecessarily detains a person in arrest or confinementwithout bringing him to trial, or fails to bring his case before the properauthority for investigation, shall on conviction by court-martial be liable,if an officer, to be cashiered or suffer some less punishment, and if a soldier,to suffer imprisonment, or some less punishment. No evidence of any pro-ceedings under this Section has been laid before us.80. We have, however, had abundant evidence of great delay duringthe period of hostilities and immediately afterwards in bringing accusedpersons to trial by court-martial. Private &quot;X &quot;, for example, was kept inclose arrest for 7 months before being tried on a charge of desertion: and thewitness who brought the case to our notice, and who was a Deputy judge advocate General during the war, said that delay of this kind was by nomeans rare. Another witness referred to the case of Private &quot; Y &quot; who hadbeen kept waiting 300 days on a charge of being absent without leave. Afurther witness testified before us that three soldiers were at that momentbeing detained in close arrest on charges of being absent without leave, andhad been so detained for three months. Yet there was nothing to preventtheir speedy trial by court-martial. We asked for this case to be speciallyinvestigated, and the result of such investigation confirmed the truth of theevidence.8t. These delays, which make the insistence of the Army Act on a&quot; speedier punishment than the ordinary forms of law will allow &quot; somewhatunreal, have several unfortunate effects, apart from being a denial of anaccused person&apos;s inherent right to a speedy trial. Thus a soldier (but not an officer) loses all pay while under close arrest awaiting trial which results in a conviction. The longer he is in such arrest, therefore, the greater is his loss of pay. Unnecessary delay in bringing him to trial thus operatesas an arbitrary and unjust punishment, which cannot be wholly relieved byawarding a light sentence after trial and conviction.   A long period spent
in arrest is (and, we think, rightly) taken into account by a court-martialwhen awarding sentence, and in consequence a sentence may be substantially less severe than it otherwise would be. But light sentences in certain circum-stances have little deterrent effect, and the publication in orders of suchsentences, without any explanation, may encourage rather than discouragean offence prevalent at the time, e.g., absence without leave. Furthermore,a delayed trial in one case, and a speedy trial in another, may lead to widelydifferent sentences for identical offences, and such disparity cannot be goodfor discipline.82. The principal reasons for undue delay in holding trials appear to bethese: (a) The inexperience of staff officers and their clerks, who are respon-sible for examining applications from commanding officers forcourts-martial, and for advising the convening officer thereon.This difficulty should not exist in peace-time though it might,under the existing system, be inevitable in time of war, due tothe great and rapid expansion of the Forces.(b) The great pressure of work on such staff officers and clerks during therecent war, especially during active operations and the moves and difficulties of communication thereby entailed.(c) The difficulty, particularly under war conditions, of taking evidence from necessary witnesses, and securing their attendance at the trial.(d) The preferring of an undue multiplicity of charges against the accused.(e) Forgetfulness, in some cases, of the urgent importance of a speedytrial. In fairness to the War Office and the Air Ministry, however,we should say that detailed official instructions, stressing the need to avoid delay in holding courts-martial, have on many occasionsbeen issued by both Departments.83. It is clear, in our opinion, that the existing safeguards against unneces-sary delay are inadequate, particularly in time of war. Stronger sanctionsare, in our opinion, essential, and we make the following recommendations:. (a) Whenever an accused person is in close arrest the 8-day report above mentioned to be rendered whether he is on active service or not,unless operational conditions make it impossible in any particular case.(b) In such cases a copy of the report should be sent direct by the commanding officer to the Director of Legal Services in the Armyor the Royal Air Force, as the case may be (to whom, as willbe seen later, we propose that certain duties at present- performed by the Judge Advocate General&apos;s Department should respectivelybe transferred). After receiving three of such reports in a par-ticular case (which will mean that the accused has been in closearrest for at least 24 days without trial) the said Director shouldmake further enquiries of the Service authorities, and he shouldbe given the power, after consultation with these authorities, toissue such orders as he may think proper to secure a speedy trial.He should also be empowered to recommend to the general or air officer commanding the formation comprising the unit in whichthe accused is serving that the accused should be released forth-with or after a specified interval, failing his being tried in themeantime.
(c) &quot;After being in close arrest for 28 days without a court-martial havingbeen convened the accused -should have the right to petition theChief Judge Martial (the new title we suggest for the judge advocate. General see paragraph 114 below) against his con-tinued detention, and be allowed to submit such petition directbut with the obligation to notify his commanding officer that hehas done so. Upon receipt of such petition the Chief judge martial should make appropriate representations to the Secretaryof State.(d) It should be made illegal to retain an accused in close arrest forlonger than 90 days without a court-martial having been convenedand having assembled. At the expiration of this period he shouldbe released and not be subject to re-arrest for the same offenceexcept on the written order of an officer having power to convene a court-martial for the trial of the offence.84. Inasmuch as a good deal of time is now spent in obtaining statementsfrom witnesses and ensuring their attendance although the evidence they areto give may be purely formal and / or undisputed, we further recommend that provision should be made enabling both the prosecution and the defence,subject to the safeguards hereinafter enumerated, to give evidence of factsby way of statutory declaration.   The safeguards we suggest are these:  (a) A copy of the statutory declaration should be served by the partyproposing to use it upon the other side at the earliest possible moment, and in any event at least 7 days before the date fixed for the court-martial unless the accused, being legally represented,or the prosecution, as the case may be, waives this last require-ment.(fo) Within 4 days after receiving such copy statutory declaration(inclusive of the day of such receipt) the party served to have theright to demand by notice in writing to the other side that thedeponent to the statutory declaration shall personally attend thecourt-martial.(c) Notwithstanding the omission to give such notice, the prosecutionor the defence to be entitled with the leave of the court to. demand the personal attendance of the deponent to the statutory declara-tion, and the court itself to be entitled to require his presence if itthinks it desirable in the interests of justice.We make this last suggestion because some unexpected develop-ment during the hearing may make it undesirable that the evidenceof some fact should consist- of a statutory declaration only. Ifthis occurs, it may be necessary to adjourn the court for the par-ticular witness to attend, but such occasions are much more likelyto be the exception rather than the rule; and the advantages which will accrue in the shape of elimination of delay, if theseproposals are accepted, will far outweigh the inconvenience ofan occasional adjournment.We also recommend that depositions on oath and being part of the summary of Evidence should be likewise admitted as evidence at a court-martial, subject to the same safeguards.85. The adoption of the foregoing recommendations will, we think, goa long way towards remedying a complaint that soldiers are frequently kept in close arrest for long periods without trial. In addition, however, we desire to emphasize the necessity for urging upon all concerned from time(29542) D
to time, the fact that soldiers should be kept in open and not close arrestawaiting trial, or should be released; without prejudice to re-arrest (a kindof military &quot; bail &quot;) unless considerations of security or discipline imperativelyrequire otherwise.Insufficiency of Legal Aid Both Before and During Trial86. Many of the witnesses who gave evidence before us criticised theabsence of a properly organised system to provide adequate facilities for thedefence of an accused person. -87. Prior to the coming into force on the 19th July, 1947, of the newLegal Aid Scheme for the Army, to which we refer later, the provision of legal representation for an accused was dealt with under Rules of Procedure87-93,88. These Rules provide that if an accused person is not represented at his trial by counsel (briefed by him at his own expense), he may berepresented by any officer subject to military law, known as &quot; the defendingofficer &quot;, or assisted by any person, known as &quot; the friend of the accused &quot;.The defending officer has the same rights and duties as counsel at the trial.A &quot; friend &quot; may advise the accused and suggest questions to be put by himto the witnesses but has himself no right of audience.89. It is the duty of the convening officer to ascertain whether an accusedperson, not otherwise represented, desires to have a defending officer assigned to represent him at his trial,.and if so, to use his best endeavours to ensurethat a suitable officer is appointed for this purpose.90. It is clear that, however liberally administered, this system was unsatis-factory in many respects and compared unfavourably with that in operation in the civil criminal courts. The Oliver Committee recommended that in proper cases legal aid should be provided on lines similar to those in opera-tion in the case of civilians who are prosecuted, and this recommendation wasbeing considered by the Service authorities at the outbreak of war in 1939.91. The unsatisfactory features in the system, as then existing, wereto some extent mitigated during the war by the fact that, owing to thelarge number of barristers and solicitors available in the forces, it waspossible in many cases to provide the accused with a&apos; reasonably competentdefending officer. But the lists of barristers and solicitors prepared bygeneral officers commanding for this purpose included persons who, thoughholding the formal qualification, had no practical experience of the adminis-tration of either criminal or military law. Moreover, there were still anumber of cases in which no barrister or solicitor of any kind could beprovided for the defence. In some of these cases, whatever the result, itmust have appeared both to the accused and to the court that the defence was not adequately presented. Presidents and judge advocates of experiencehave told us of cases in which it has been necessary for them to assist in theconduct of the defence, because of the inexperience of the defending officer.92. Upon demobilisation the number of lawyers in the Forces diminishedrapidly and the need for a permanent and more satisfactory scheme of legal aid became urgent. Accordingly, in April, 1946, a Committee was set upby the Army Council under the Chairmanship of Major-General H. Murray,C B., D.S.O., then Director of Personal Services, to consider, in the lightof the Oliver Report, the administrative procedure by which, in commandsboth at home and abroad, legal aid could be provided on lines similar tothose upon which legal aid is provided for civilians in criminal courts
93- This Committee recommended a scheme for the provision of com-petent legal aid without regard to rank (but subject to practicability and means) on a contributory basis whenever necessary in the interests ofjustice,(a) in cases of the same type as those which would come before criminalcourts;(b) in the case of purely military offences, where a legally qualifiedprosecutor is employed,&apos; or which involve points of legal difficulty,or expert examination of witnesses, or where the results of thecase are of considerable consequence to the accused.This scheme is now in operation in both Services (see Army CouncilInstruction 603 of 19th July, 1947, and Air Ministry Order A. 716 of 4thSeptember, 1947).94. We welcome this scheme and are of opinion that it is based upon theright principles. It is avowedly experimental and still incomplete, but anydefects and possible improvements will appear from practical experience gained in the operation of the scheme, and criticism of administrative detailat this stage would serve no useful purpose.95. There are, however, two matters to which we wish to refer in con-nection with the question of legal aid. The first is that apart from legalrepresentation at the trial, we. think it is very important that an accusedperson should have advice at the earliest possible moment after he has beencharged with any offence. Many soldiers and airmen, both regulars andthose called up under the National Service Act, will be under the age of twenty-one. They will often be remote from their family and friends, inmany cases for the first time in their lives. They may have to decidequestions of considerable difficulty and importance, e.g., whether or no theyshould elect to go for trial by court-martial or take their commanding officer&apos;saward, and the nature of the evidence that they should call in their defence in the early stages of the investigation of a charge against them. Apart fromthese practical considerations we consider that it is most desirable, from thepoint of view both of the accused and of his family, not to create the impres-sion that a youth charged with an offence for the first time is left to his owndevices without experienced and sympathetic advice on the conduct of hisdefence in the early stages.96. We realize that it would be impracticable to have a lawyer availableto advise at this stage in every case, nor do we consider it necessary or desirable that an accused person should be legally represented before hiscompany or commanding officer. But we consider that it should be the dutyof every commanding officer to ensure, as is now frequently done, that, before a man is brought in front of him charged with an offence for which the manmay be tried by court-martial, he shall be advised by a suitable person ofany rank, either of his own choice or, failing such choice, selected by the commanding officer. Such adviser should be competent to inform the accused of his rights and advise him as to the conduct of his defence at that stage.97. The second matter to which we desire to refer is the question of the representation of an accused person at the taking of the Summary of Evidence.As we have shown earlier in this Report, under the existing system a Summaryof Evidence has to be taken in every case to be tried by court-martial in whichthe accused is below commissioned rank.   This necessitates the examination(29542)
of witnesses in the presence of the accused and the taking down of their evidence either by the commanding officer or by some other officer appointedby him. The evidence may be taken on oath, if the accused so demands, orthe commanding officer so directs. The accused is not entitled to be legallyrepresented.98. In the case of an officer a Summary of Evidence need not be takenunless the accused so requires; otherwise an Abstract of Evidence, notprepared in the presence of the accused, takes the place of the Summary.We have been informed that this system works satisfactorily and that it isexceptional for an officer, when asked, not to consent to the use of anAbstract!99. The Summary and Abstract resemble,. in many respects, depositionstaken in Magistrates&apos; Courts. It is to be observed, however, that whereasdepositions are taken only in indictable cases, the Summary or Abstract istaken or made in every case, however trivial, which has to go to court-martial for trial.100. There have been criticisms of the method of taking the Summary.It has been suggested:  (a) that as the Summary is frequently taken by a person with little- or .no knowledge of the criminal law, inadmissible evidence sometimesappears in the Summary, and. that the&apos;existing safeguards toexpunge such evidence from the Summary before it is made avail-able to the president of the court-martial are inadequate;(b) that the fact that the accused is not entitled to be represented at the taking of the Summary may operate unfairly to him;(c) that the person taking the Summary has frequently been actively engaged in the investigation of the case-and appears, in effect,to be the prosecutor; and(d) that the evidence should always be on oath.101. While we consider that there is some substance in these criticismsin difficult and complicated cases, it would not, in our opinion, be practicable to require that in every case the Summary should be taken by a legallyqualified person with legal representation both of the prosecution and the accused and with all testimony on oath.. Apart from the lack of persons withthe necessary qualifications, it seems clear that so elaborate a form of pre-liminary trial is unnecessary and must increase the delay in disposing of alarge number of straightforward cases.102. In approaching this problem we have first considered whether thereis any valid reason for maintaining the distinction between the treatment ofofficers and other ranks in this respect. It appears to the Committee thatthis difference probably dates from the time when many soldiers below com-missioned rank were unable to read, and we see no reason why, in existing conditions and subject to appropriate safeguards, the Abstract of Evidence,which has been found satisfactory in the case of officers, should not normally be used in straightforward cases irrespective of the rank of the accused.103. Accordingly, we recommend that:  (a) at an investigation of a charge which is not disposed of summarilythe commanding officer should record or cause to be recorded ashort precis of the evidence of each witness giving the name and address and attach any relevant documents;
(b) the commanding officer should forward the report of the case,together with the precis of the evidence and material documents to the proper superior authority with a view to the case being brought before a court-martial;(c) if the convening officer decides that there is a prima facie case for trial by court-martial the accused should be served free of chargewith a copy of the Abstract as soon as practicable, and in any event not less than 48 hours before the trial commences;(d) except in cases in which a sentence of death or penal servitude for life may be passed, a Summary need not be taken unless ordered by the convening officer or required by the accused;(e) the accused should not be entitled to require a Summary withoutleave of the convening officer, if charged with any offence forwhich the maximum punishment does not exceed two years&apos;imprisonment, but should be entitled to require a Surnmary as of right in all other cases;(/) the accused in every case should be asked in writing and should reply in writing, whether he desires to apply for, or to exercise his right to require the taking of, a Summary;(g) in cases in which a Summary is taken the officer detailed to take itshould be appointed by the convening officer and should be either a permanent president (see our recommendation in paragraph206 below) or other officer with suitable experience or legalqualifications. In cases of exceptional difficulty or importance,a member of the Chief Judge Maftial&apos;s Department might beappointed;(h) the Summary should be taken in the presence of the accused who should be entitled to be represented, and his representative shouldhave all the rights and duties of counsel.(i) all evidence taken at the Summary should be on oath.104. We would observe that under this system the soldier will still betreated more favourably than the civilian, who when tried summarily doesnot know the evidence against him until it is called at the trial.Defects in Procedure(1) The Judge Advocate General105. The first, and one of the most important, criticisms under this headrelates to the present method of appointing the Judge Advocate General, andto the conflicting nature of the duties at present laid upon the holder of that office in relation to courts-martial. These questions can, we think, properly be considered under the heading of &quot; Defects in Procedure &quot; though thedefect in this case is fundamental.106. The Oliver Committee recommended in para. 15 of its Report&quot; That the Judge Advocate General  should be  appointed  on therecommendation of, and be responsible to, some Minister other thanthe Secretary of State for War or Air &quot;.The Oliver Committee made this recommendation in view of theimportance of removing from the mind of the public any impression that the judge Advocate General, whose duty it is, among other things, to review all
convictions of court-martial and to advise the Secretaries of State for Warand Air on questions of law arising out of such review, is in any sense- a subordinate official of the War Office or the Air Ministry. The Oliver Com-mittee was satisfied that the Judge Advocate General, although appointed,on the recommendation of the Secretary of State for War, in fact enjoyed,in the discharge of his duties, complete independence; but considered it most desirable that steps should be taken to remove any possible misunderstandingon this point.107. We have come to the same conclusion and for the same reason;and we recommend that in future the Judge Advocate General should beappointed on the recommendation of the Lord Chancellor and should beresponsible to him. In relation to the Secretaries of State for War and air the duties of the Judge Advocate General should continue to be advisoryin character: and while, no doubt, there will be few occasions upon which such advice will not be accepted, and acted upon, no invariable rule to this effect should, in the Committee&apos;s view, be prescribed. The ultimate res-ponsibility in the matter should be left where it is at present, namely in thetwo Secretaries of State.108. We have also considered the present constitution of the judge advocate General&apos;s Office. It consists of three separate departments: theMilitary Department, the Air Force Department, and the judge advocate General&apos;s Office proper, which we will call the &quot; Judicial Depart-ment &quot;. The Military and Air Force Departments are staffed by serving officers with legal qualifications, whose duties include the preparation of casesfor trial by court-martial, and, where necessary, the conduct of the prosecu-tion at such trials. The Judicial Department is staffed by civil servants withlegal qualifications and serving officers seconded from the Military and AirForce Departments, who act as Judge Advocates at courts-martial and,under the Judge Advocate General, review the proceedings afterwards. NoJudge Advocate, however, reviews the proceedings of any court-martial atwhich he acted as a Judge Advocate. During the recent war many lawyers,both barristers and solicitors of eminence and standing in their profession,who had joined His Majesty&apos;s Forces worked in this Judicial Department.109. In the Committee&apos;s view, and in order to secure that justice is notonly done but is seen to be done, these three departments should cease to be combined in one office.   We recommend the following changes:  (a) There should be constituted under the Secretary of State for War aseparate Department in charge of a &quot; Director of Army LegalServices &quot; or some other appropriate title. The functions and staff of the present Military Department of the Judge advocate general&apos;s Office should be transferred to this new Department.It should be what is known in the Army as an &quot; Adjutant-GeneraFs service &quot;, the staff thus coming under the Adjutant-General for purposes of discipline and general administration.(6) There should be constituted under the Secretary of State for Air aseparate Department in charge of a &quot; Director of Air Force LegalServices &quot; or some other appropriate title. The functions and staff of the present Air Force Department of the Judge advocate general&apos;s Office should be transferred to this new Department.It should be under the Air Member for Personnel of the air council, the staff thus coming under him for purposes of discipline and general administration.
206(c) This separation of functions should extend also to Commands abroadwhere the Judge Advocate General, the. Director of Army LegalServices and the Director of Air Force Legal Services would eachhave his own Deputy with the necessary staff.(d) The Judge Advocate General should in future be responsible only for the work at present done by the Judicial Department.Pending the changes which we recommend later in this Reportthis work will consist of the supply of Judge Advocates, the reviewor court-martial proceedings, and the tendering of advice on questions of law arising out of such proceedings.no. In this way what may with substantial accuracy be called the pro-secuting and judicial sides of the Judge Advocate General&apos;s work will be completely separated, and he and his staff will be confined to the latter.Clearly this is as it should be; and the Committee finds itself in this respect in complete agreement with the similar recommendations made by the OliverCommittee.in. It will be a matter for consideration and decision by others whetherthe two new legal departments above recommended should perform otherlegal work for the Army and the Royal Air Force, in addition to work in con-nection with courts-martial.112. We have attempted to give an outline of the establishment of theproposed new departments, the details of which are in Appendix C. the establishments shown there represent a considerable increase on the presentestablishment of the Judge Advocate General&apos;s Department and, though werealize the importance of avoiding unnecessary expenditure, the position mustbe faced that the complete separation of the judicial and prosecuting sides of the Judge Advocate-General&apos;s work (a reform which we consider is longoverdue) will cost money.113. Furthermore, it is most important that the rates of pay, pension,terms of service and promotion in the new Departments should be such asto attract lawyers of skill and experience who would inspire confidence inthe minds of the public and of those serving in the Army and Royal AirForce. In this connection the Committee desires to recommend that, irres-pective of the period they may have been in outside legal practice, special,consideration should be given to those candidates of either Service who havesatisfactorily borne the heavy and responsible burden during the war asDeputy Judge Advocates General.114. Finally, under this head&apos; we recommend that the title of &quot; judge advocate General &quot; be changed. As we have pointed out in paragraph 30above, this title is misleading as tending to suggest that the holder of theoffice is both an advocate and a judge. If our proposals are accepted thefunctions of the Judge Advocate General and his staff will be exclusivelyjudicial and advisory, and we think in future he should be known as the&quot; Chief Judge Martial &quot;, a title which will indicate the judicial character ofthe office as well as its association with the Services. In view of the respon-sibility of the post, the qualifications required, and the necessity for complete independence, we further recommend that the status and remuneration ofthe Chief Judge Martial should be not less than that of a puisne Judge ofthe High Court of Justice, except that he should retire at 70 years of ageunless his tenure of office is specially extended, and that it should not benecessary to have an address from both Houses of Parliament before he couldbe removed.
(2) The Judge Advocate115. Early in our deliberations we reached the conclusion that the practiceof the judge advocate retiring with the court when the court was consideringits findings should cease forthwith. Almost every witness who appeared before us took this view. One or two expressed the opinion that the presenceof the judge advocate was of assistance to the court during its deliberationson the guilt or innocence of the accused; but there were two answers to any suggestion that for this reason the present practice should be allowed to con-tinue. The first was that if the ^tribunal, when considering its verdict,found itself in need of assistance from the judge advocate on some pointof law, it was preferable, and quite easy, for the court to be re-opened,and for the advice to be given by the judge advocate in the hearing of the accused and of the prosecution. The second (and in the minds of theCommittee, the conclusive) answer was that inasmuch as the judge advocatein his summing-up of the case may, in the proper discharge of his duty,have been compelled to make observations damaging to the defence, thespectacle of his retiring with the court to consider the verdict could not fail to cause the gravest misgivings in the mind of the accused. The lattermight well conclude that if the tribunal were in any doubt about his guilt,the judge advocate would soon resolve that doubt to his prejudice. Althoughjustice might be done, it would not appear to the accused to have certainlybeen done: and since the appearance of justice having been done is next in importance to the fact, we concluded that a change in the practice shouldbe made without delay. The Oliver Committee made a similar recommenda-tion.116. The Chairman communicated this recommendation to the secretaries of State for War and Air by letters dated the 17th April, 1947. It was accepted and put into effect. If the further recommendations as to the composition of a General Court-Martial which are made hereafter in thisReport are accepted, a different procedure, not requiring the presence of a judge advocate, will ;be followed.(3) Finding and Sentence Announcement117. In the letters of the 17th April, 1947, above referred to, it was recommended that all findings of guilt should be announced in open courtat once, as were all verdicts of &quot; Not guilty &quot;. Previously when the courtconsidered that the accused was guilty (even &quot;of a less offence than thatactually charged) it merely said that it had no pronouncement to make, thatits findings were subject to confirmation, and if confirmed would be promulgated-gated to the accused. Thus, although the accused might have been foundguilty of common assault instead of manslaughter, he would not know this,and might not know it for weeks until the findings were promulgated. Inthe meantime his state of mind could well be imagined. He might similarly be  left in ignorance that he had been found guilty of the charge of absencewithout leave only, instead of the graver charge of desertion with which hewas actually charged. It was not to the point, therefore, to say that the accused knew that he had been found guilty by the mere statement thatthe court had no findings to announce. Again, the circumstances that the accused might have been found guilty of some less offence than that chargedmade it extremely difficult for his advocate properly to discharge his task,when invited by the court to addresss it in mitigation of sentence.118. The argument advanced in favour of the system was that it mightavoid an adverse effect on discipline in cases where an officer or non-commissioned officer was found guilty of an offence, but the finding was
afterwards not confirmed, or was quashed. In such a case it was said, ifthe finding had been publicly announced at the trial,, the officer or non-commissioned officer in spite of the final result, could hardly command the same respect from his subordinates as before, and this would, or might,react upon the discipline of those under his command. We were notimpressed by this argument, and it was not endorsed by the majority of theservice witnesses who have appeared before us. The situation postulatedalready arose when a conviction, after being confirmed and promulgated,was quashed on review.119. The majority of the Committee also took the view that the sentence of the court should likewise be announced in open court as soon as it was determined.120. Our recommendations in these respects were accepted, and findings of guilt, and the sentence are now announced forthwith in open court.(4) Findings by a Majority121. We have considered whether, in view of the new procedure that wehave recommended, any alteration should be made in the existing practicewhereby the finding by a court-martial of guilt or innocence is decided bya majority of votes. In cases tried by Magistrates whether in Petty Sessionsor in the Appeal Committee of Quarter Sessions the verdict may be decided by a majority; but in all indictable cases tried by a jury the verdict mustbe unanimous. In the event of a jury not being able to agree upon theverdict the case may be tried again before another jury. Such disagree-ments are very infrequent.122. The evidence before us on this matter was conflicting. Someexperienced presidents and judge advocates informed us that majority verdictswere practically unknown and others that they were of frequent occurrence.The explanation of this may well be that some presidents are prepared toaccept a majority verdict without further argument, whereas others arereluctant to take this course and spend time discussing the doubts of the minority with the result, in some cases, that the verdict becomes unanimous.This latter practice has much to commend it. Not only is it unsatisfactoryto the accused, his legal representatives and friends, to feel that he may havebeen convicted of a serious offence involving heavy punishment, by a baremajority, but it is also undesirable that any member of a court-martial should feel that due consideration has not been given to his opinion.123. We have heard no convincing argument as to why &quot;the salutaryrule that the verdicts of juries must be unanimous, should not be applied inthe case of courts-martial. We do not consider, once this necessity is realized,that any greater difficulty should be experienced in securing unanimity incourts-martial than in the civil courts.124. It was suggested that if this rule were adopted it should be confined to a finding of guilt and that a majority verdict should suffice for an acquittal.Though the suggestion is superficially attractive we do not agree with it.If adopted it would mean that in every case in which a disagreement occurredit would be known that a majority was in favour of the conviction, a fact which might prejudice the accused in any further trial. We realize that indifficult cases this recommendation may result in courts-martial taking a longer time to consider their findings, but we think that a small amount of extra time will be well spent in the interests of justice.(29542) &apos; E
125- Accordingly we recommend that all findings of guilt or innocenceshould be unanimous. In the event of a disagreement the accused shouldbe liable to be retried before another court-martial with different membership.126. As regards sentence we do not consider that unanimity is necessary and we see no reason to recommend any alteration in the existing practice- whereby sentence is decided by a majority of votes.(5) Lack of Shorthand Writers127. At all trials by court-martial of the more serious charges, and par-ticularly where the accused if found guilty may be sentenced to death, thepresence of a shorthand writer to take a verbatim note of the proceedingsis most desirable.128. By &quot; shorthand writer &quot; we mean a shorthand writer capable of taking down the proceedings of a court verbatim and with accuracy suchas those who practise in the Royal Courts of Justice. The ordinary short-hand typist is not, as a rule, capable of performing this highly skilled work,and in the result might do more harm than good.129. There have been one of two instances of trials for murder by court-martial on the Continent of Europe since the war where no shorthand writerwas employed. In our view it is essential that a shorthand writer should beemployed in all capital cases tried by General Court-Martial. We suggestthat it should be the absolute duty of the convening officer to notify the judge Advocate General (or, in due course, the Director of Legal Servicesof the Army or the Royal Air Force) whenever he issues an order conveninga court-martial for the trial of a capital offence, and to ask that arrangementsbe made for a shorthand writer to attend the trial. The convening officers should send a similar notification and request in relation to any other case which, in his opinion, is sufficiently serious or complicated to justify theemployment of a shorthand writer.130. The responsibility for supplying a shorthand writer should then beupon the Judge Advocate General (or the said Director) who should supplyone from his own staff or, if this is not possible, should secure one froman outside firm. If, in spite of all effort, no shorthand writer can be obtained,the Judge Advocate General (or the said Director) should notify the con-vening officer to that effect. He in turn should similarly notify the presidentof the court-martial and this latter notification should be read in open courtat the commencement of the trial.131. The&apos;supply of shorthand writers is unfortunately limited, and it mustbe expected that trials by court-martial will continue to take place withouta shorthand writer, although his presence would be most desirable. we hope, however, that this will never be the case at the trial of a capitaloffence.132. There is no easy long term solution of this problem. On the evidence we have heard we do not think it is possible for the Services to train recruitsup to the standard of shorthand writers (as we have defined them). Andif shorthand writers are to be attracted into the Service from outside, theterms of service will have to be made very exceptional seeing tha.t theseexperts may earn up to  1,000 per annum in civil life. In these circum-stances we can do no more than to emphasize the importance of supplyingshorthand writers at trials of the kind above referred to, although in manycases this may mean securing them from outside firms.
CHAPTER IVAPPEALS134. At present there is no right of appeal to a higher court againstconviction or sentence (or both) by a court-martial, corresponding to the rightof appeal possessed by a civilian who is convicted on indictment and sen-tenced by a civil court. Any officer or soldier convicted and sentenced by acourt-martial may (see paragraph 71 above) submit a petition against the finding or the sentence or both; but has no right to be heard when suchpetition is being considered. All court-martial proceedings are also reviewed by the Judge Advocate General in London&apos; (see paragraph 70 above) in orderto ensure that no irregularity or miscarriage or justice has occurred, but this review takes place in private and the convicted person is not present.135. The Committee which sat in 1919, under the chairmanship of LordDarling (hereinafter called the Darling Committee) to consider court-martialprocedure, recommended that no formal Court of Appeal from the decisions of courts-martial should be set up.   That Committee thought that the system of(29542) E 2133. (i) Power should be given to the president of a court-martial toallow the amendment of a charge upon similar conditions to those prescribed in Section 5 of the Indictments Act, 1915.(ii) A court-martial should be empowered in its discretion to take intoconsideration for the purposes of sentence other offences admitted by the accused, subject to the qualifications (a) that such other offences, should be similar in character and triable by court-^nartial, and (b) that stoppages of pay (where such punishment is appropriate) may be imposed for eachoffence which the accused wishes to be taken into consideration as though a separate conviction had been recorded in respect of each such offence but(c) that, subject as aforesaid, the sentence should not exceed the maximumfor the offence actually charged.If this recommendation is accepted it should reduce the present practice ofpreferring a multiplicity of charges, particularly where this is necessary underthe present system to recover losses by means of stoppages of pay.(iii) A court-martial should be given, wherever possible, after findingbut before sentence, the same kind of record of the accused&apos;s career as is now given at that point in a civil criminal trial.(iv) Form for the convening of a Field General Court-Martial__-The formprescribed in the Second Appendix to the Rules of Procedure for the. con-vening of a Field General Court-Martial contains the following recital:  &quot; Whereas it appears to me, the undersigned, an officer in command of.............................., on active service that the persons named in the annexed Schedule, being subject to Military Law, have committed the offences in the said Schedule mentioned; &quot;.It has been represented to us that this wording may lead the membersof a court-martial to think that the- convening officer is satisfied as to theguilt of the accused.The point is a minor one, but we think it deserves attention while FieldGeneral Courts-Martial are retained in their present form.(v) An attempt should be made to define the offence of mutiny. In thelight of present-day conditions it is capable of too wide an interpretation.
confirmation of findings and sentence, followed by the review of the pro-ceedings by the Judge Advocate General, together with the right on the partof the accused person to present a petition, put the latter in a better position than a civilian convicted and sentenced by a civil court.&quot; Three members ofthe Darling Committee dissented from this view, and signed a separate reportrecommending that a Court of Appeal should be set up.136. The Oliver Committee&apos;, reporting in 1938, also considered that aCourt of Appeal was unnecessary. . They said:  &quot; we have come &quot;unanimously to the conclusion that in the light of theevidence no such experiment is necessary, desirable or practicable, andthat the present system as a system has fully justified itself &quot;.137. The Oliver Committee were impressed with the fact that mostoffences tried by courts-martial were offences against discipline and they thought that such offences were better handled at every stage by personsfamiliar with Service, discipline. - -138. In the light of these pronouncements we have considered the questionof appeals with especial care. Circumstances have changed since the Darlingand Oliver Committees reported. Service under the National Service Actin peace-time, the effect of which they did not have to consider, emphasizesthe- importance of the principle which we think no one would dispute,namely, that in the matter of legal safeguards, citizens should be. no worse off when they are in the Forces than in civil life unless considerations of discipline or other circumstances make such a disadvantage inevitable. Wehave endeavoured to keep this principle in the forefront of our minds through-out this Report.139. Neither the Darling nor the Oliver Committee, so far as their reportsdisclose, made any recommendation upon the question of granting a rightof appeal on a question of law as distinct from a question of fact. The OliverCommittee after indicating that there were these two distinct rights of appealopen in certain cases in civil life, proceeded to reject the suggestion of theright of appeal from a court-martial for reasons which, though weighty asregards appeals on questions of fact, have much less weight as regardsappeals on questions of law. The Committee in its recommendation made no distinction between the two, and the Report does not disclose whetherthe Committee considered granting an appeal on questions of law, as distinct from fact, nor, if they did consider this question, what reasons led that committee to reject the idea.140. We do not recommend that a right to a rehearing of a case tried by court-martial should be given. The civilian himself has no such rightexcept where he is convicted at Petty Sessions and appeals against his con-viction to Quarter Sessions. Such an appeal is in fact a rehearing of thecase. But the civilian convicted on indictment, either at Quarter Sessionsor Assizes, has no such right to a rehearing. Moreover, it would be impos-sible in many cases, especially on active service, to get all the witnessestogether again for a second trial, and would impose a wholly undue burdenupon the Forces.141. These objections, in our opinion, do not apply to an appeal on apoint of law. The case would not be retried, the appeal being directedsimply to the question whether some error of law. had occurred in the pro-ceedings sufficiently serious to justify quashing of the conviction. thisis precisely the question which the Judge Advocate General already has todetermine under the present system of review.   The drawback of that system
209is, however, that the Forces do not see it in operation nor does it necessarily take place at once. All that is known is that somebody in an office inLondon (whom the soldier probably, though erroneously, regards as a WarOffice official) is supposed to look through the case after conviction to seethat all is according to rule. The Forces also know that a petition againstconviction and sentence may be presented, but nobody knows, not eventhe accused, the reasons which lead to a petition being dismissed if that isits fate.142. A further disadvantage was well described to us by a witness whoat the time he was giving evidence was engaged in drafting a petition againstthe conviction of a number of soldiers by a court-martial at which he him-self had appeared as counsel for the defence. He said in effect &quot; I can put&apos;&apos; down my various reasons of law on paper, but when reading them the Judge&quot; Advocate General may form in his own mind some ground for thinking that&quot; they are not well founded. If I knew what that ground was, I might be able&quot; to show him by argument that his view was wrong. But I shall never&apos;&apos; get the opportunity of doing so such as I would have if there were an oral&quot; hearing of an appeal &quot;.143. We have come to the clear conclusion that a right of appeal ona question of law ought to be granted against conviction by court-martialwhenever the accused has pleaded &quot; Not guilty &quot;; and that such right ofappeal should, in cases of conviction after some date to be announced, takethe place of the present system of review of the proceedings by the judge advocate General.144. This Court of Appeal should not, in our opinion, be the Court of criminal Appeal. The Judges who constitute that Court have also to do their ordinary work as Judges of the King&apos;s Bench Division, and we thinkthat the addition of the work of hearing appeals against convictions by court-martial would throw an undue strain upon the Court of criminal appeal. We think the Court should consist of the Chief Judge Martial,the Vice-Chief Judge Martial and the Judges Martial, all of the Departmentof the Chief Judge Martial which we have already recommended should be formed to replace the present Department of the Judge Advocate General.In addition there should be formed a panel approved by the Lord Chancellorof King&apos;s Counsel willing to serve on such a Court should occasion arise.Any three of the foregoing persons should constitute a Court. The court should normally sit in London and at other convenient centres inthe United Kingdom but in exceptional circumstances might sit abroad.It should have power in exceptional cases (as has the Court of criminal appeal) to allow fresh evidence to be called. It should have power to quasha conviction by court-martial in any case where it comes to the conclusionthat an error of law has occurred sufficiently serious to make it unsafe toallow the conviction to stand. But it should have power to affirm con-viction even if an error of law has occurred, provided the Court is satisfiedthat no substantial miscarriage of justice has thereby taken place. We referhereinafter to this Court as the &quot; Courts-Martial Appeal Court &quot;.145. On conviction by court-martial the Court itself should be empoweredto grant a certificate of leave to appeal or the accused should be entitledto apply within fourteen days for leave to appeal. This application shouldbe in writing, signed by the accused or his legal representative, and shouldspecify the grounds upon which the application is made. It should be sentto the Chief Judge Martial or to the Judge Martial in the Command in whichthe accused is serving, being a person who had taken no part in the court-martial itself.     If will be for the Chief Judge Martial or the said Judge
Martial to grant or refuse leave to appeal according to the view he takesof the grounds of .the application. Either way he will notify his decision in writing to the accused or his legal Representative, and if the decision is. adverse, the accused should have the right within a further fourteen days from the receipt of such decision (with power in the Courts-Martial appeal court to extend the time in suitable cases) to apply to the Courts-MartialAppeal Court itself for leave to appeal, and stating whether he wishes tobe present when the application is heard.146. This application would be heard orally by the Court sitting in public and the defence should have the right of audience and to be legallyrepresented. At this stage it would not normally be necessary for the accused to attend or for the prosecution to be represented. If the applica-tion were refused, that would be the end of the matter. If leave to appealwere granted, then the appeal would be argued either there and then or at some later convenient date. At such hearing the accused should havethe right to be present in capital cases and in other cases by leave of theCourts-Martial Appeal Court.147. The requirement that leave to appeal should be obtained either from the Judge Martial in the Command, or from the Courts-Martial appeal court, is necessary in order to stop frivolous appeals. A further stop onsuch appeals may be desirable in the shape of power in the Courts-MartialAppeal Court to order, in the case of a frivolous application for leave to appeal, that the accused&apos;s sentence shall begin to run as from the date when such application is dismissed, so that any part of the sentence served upto that date shall not count. We may say here that we do not recommendthat the sentence passed by a court-martial should be suspended automaticallymerely because the accused makes an application for leave to appeal. Itmay well be that in some cases where a light sentence is inflicted, an applica-tion may be lodged and may turn out to be successful after the sentencehas been served. This unfortunately is true in civil life as well and cannot,we think, be avoided. Conviction and sentence must be assumed to be validand have their effect until they are displaced. It should, however, be opento the court-martial, the Judge Martial in the command or the Courts-MartialAppeal Court on giving leave to appeal to recommend to the appropriatemilitary authority that the sentence be suspended pending the determination of the appeal.148. It will not be easy to work out the foregoing system of appeal inwar-time (particularly where the accused may be serving at the time of thecourt-martial- in a beleaguered garrison), nor in peace-time in relation to a conviction overseas. In the Colonies, however, local barristers of repute,and local judges might be put.on the panel of Appeal Judges above referredto and help to form the Court. We do not think, however, that we wouldbe justified in imagining the most difficult cases that are likely to arise, and recommending or not recommending an institution of the Court of Appealaccording to its practicability in such extreme cases. Administrative ingenuityand goodwill should, we think, overcome most of the difficulties; but evenotherwise the case for an oral hearing of an appeal on a question of lawis too strong to be withheld simply because of its difficulty in a minority of possible cases. By the institution of such a right of appeal justice will notonly be done, but it will be seen to be done, and justice is not, in this res-pect, seen to be done at present.149. If our recommendation is adopted the system of confirmation shouldbe abolished; so also should the review of court-martial proceedings which at. present takes place by the Judge Advocate General.
150. If the change suggested by us is approved and put into force,that change should not be made retrospective. In other words persons con-victed before any change is put into force would be unable to make useof the machinery of a Court of Appeal but would continue to have the rightof review_so that for a time at least the two systems would run concurrently.But we think that a time limit should be set on the length of time duringwhich the persons convicted under the present system should have their cases reviewed. The right to petition the Sovereign should continue, and itwould be the duty of the Chief Judge Martial&apos;s Department to advice uponthe new petitions, when required.151. In cases where the Attorney General certifies that a point of law of exceptional public importance is involved and that it is desirable in thepublic interest that a further appeal should be brought, and gives his fiataccordingly, there should be a right of final appeal to the Judicial Committeeof the Privy Council. We suggest the Judicial Committee because such anappeal may come from various places abroad and may concern a Colonialsoldier.Appeal Against Sentence152. The question whether a right of appeal against the sentence of acourt-martial should be granted raises different issues, and cannot be auto-matically decided by reference to the same considerations as those which have led us to recommend a right of appeal against the finding.153. A trial by court-martial involves the application of a fairly com-plicated system of law and procedure, such complication being due, in alarge measure, to the desire to be scrupulously fair to the accused. in applying this system to the cases which come before them, and which mayexhibit every shade and variety of circumstances, courts-martial must almost inevitably from time to time make mistakes. Some such mistakes may be purely venial, and occasion no injustice. Others, however, such as thewrongful admission of certain evidence, may be so serious as to make it unsafefor the finding to stand. There is, therefore, an obvious need for someright of appeal against the finding of a court-martial so that if any suchmistake as aforesaid is alleged, the matter can be investigated and decided.154. In the case of the sentence, however, the position is different. Forexample, if a court-martial awarded a sentence of imprisonment in excess ofthe maximum for the offence charged, the accused person who was the victim of such a legal error would have a right of legal redress. He couldapply to the King&apos;s Bench Division by way of cerfiorari proceedings andhave the sentence quashed. It is in the highest degree unlikely, of course,that the Service authorities would let any case proceed so far before them-selves correcting the error.155. It follows that a right of appeal against sentence can be advocatedand justified only on the ground that a court-martial may award a sentencewhich is too severe, and that review by some independent Tribunal should,therefore, be available if the accused person so desires.156. No evidence of a general tendency on the part of courts-martialtowards undue severity in the matter of sentence has been given before us.If anything, the evidence we have had tends to suggest that the soldierfrequently gets a lighter sentence from a court-martial than he would get from a civil court for the same offence. This consideration does not, however,lead use very far towards a solution of the problem; for however courts-martial
may have acted in the past, they will not necessarily act in the same way inthe future. We thing we must face this question: if a civilian who thinkshis sentence top.severe may appeal, why not a soldier?157. Earlier in this Report (see paragraph 11) we have said the tasks of a soldier, and the circumstances under which he may have to perform them,call for a high degree of discipline: and that it has always been recognizedthat in order to maintain such discipline a special code of military law isnecessary If this be accepted, it follows that the treatment of a soldier con-victed of an offence against military law may in some respects have to be different from the treatment of a civilian convicted of an offence against thecivil law. In our opinion, the case of a soldier sentenced by court-martialis one of the cases where considerations of discipline inevitably involve a difference between the rights which can.be afforded to a soldier who isaggrieved by his sentence, and those which have been accorded to a civilian.158. A civilian, for example, can appeal to a higher civil court. In ourview, however, it would be a mistake to give a soldier the right to appealto a civil court against his sentence. It would tend to be subversive of discipline if a soldier, sentenced by court-martial, could appeal to a courtcomposed of civilians with a prospect of getting his sentence reduced. Thefinal word upon punishment must, in our opinion, remain with the service authorities, upon whom the duty of maintaining discipline is laid. We wouldnot, therefore, recommend that the Courts-Martial Appeal Court should begiven jurisdiction to hear appeals against sentence as well as against finding.159! Should there, however, be a right of appeal to a Military Court?Before answering this question we think it would be useful to recall what theposition is at present:  (a) After sentence has been pronounced by the court-martial it requiresconfirmation by the confirming officer. (See section 54(6) of theArmy Act.) The confirming officer may mitigate, remit or com-mute the sentence.(b) The accused may submit a petition against his sentence, as finally determined, to any confirming or reviewing authority, includingthe King. As to &quot; reviewing authorities &quot;, see section 57(2) ofthe Army Act.   There is no limit to the number of such petitions.(c) The sentence is periodically reviewed by the Service authorities,having power to mitigate, remit, or commute it.In the sense that he may submit a petition, the accused has already aright of appeal against his sentence; and his position is better than that of a civilian to this extent, that whether he exercises such a right or not, the sentence is automatically brought under review, first by the confirming officer,and at intervals thereafter by other Service authorities.^ 160. The granting of a right of appeal to a Military Court would, wethink, make only one material difference in the present position, namely, thatthe accused could be represented before such a court, and oral representa-tions made on his behalf.161. Such a court could either be composed of officers serving in the sameCommand as that in which the offence was committed, or the court-martialwas held, or it could be a permanent court sitting centrally, and composedof fairly senior officers. We would reject the first alternative. To adopt itwould, in effect, mean summoning a second court-martial finally to determine the sentence; and we do not think that such a course would be warranted.The appeal against sentence must lie, if at all, to some permanent court.
162. Adequate safeguards would, however, have to be provided againstfrivolous appeals: and to make sure that appeals would be made only inthose cases where reasonable grounds for questioning the sentence existed.Otherwise there would be danger of the court being overwhelmed with appeals.The tobvious safeguard would be to make it incumbent upon the would-beappellant to obtain leave to appeal; and some authority would therefore have to be invested with the duty of examining applications for leave to appeal, and granting or withholding leave.If, however, a court-martial inflicts an unreasonable sentence, the numberof cases where the matter would not be corrected by the confirming officer, or,following a petition, by a reviewing authority, would in our opinion be avery small percentage of the total number of cases. And it would be for this very small percentage of cases that the new Military Court would be set up,and some authority invested with the duty of examining every applicationfor leave to appeal to the court. All this would be for the sake of the oralargument of the appeal, either by the accused or his representative, whichis the one material difference which such a system would make.163. In our view, oral argument, though of prime importance to the presentation of an appeal against finding, is not of such importance to anappeal against sentence. All that can be urged in mitigation of sentence can,we think, be equally well urged by way of written submissions (as in a petition) as by oral address. In any event there is not such a distinctadvantage in the latter as would warrant setting up a special Military Court,with the necessary safeguards against frivolous appeals. It has, moreover, tobe remembered that such a court, sitting in some central place, is less likelyto be conversant with conditions in the locality where the offence was com-mitted, than the members of the court-martial which inflicted the sentence,and the confirming officer who considered it. Yet such local conditionsmight be a very relevant factor in the determination of a proper sentence.164. These considerations lead us to the following conclusions, whichmay also be treated as our recommendations:  (a) That jurisdiction over sentence should remain entirely with the service authorities.That accordingly no right of appeal against sentence to a tribunal. composed of civilians should be instituted.That there are not sufficient grounds for the grant of a new right ofappeal to a military tribunal.That the power of the Service authorities to mitigate, remit orcommute the sentences of courts-martial should be preserved.That while confirmation, as a condition of the validity of a sentence,should be abolished, the officer who would otherwise be the con-firming officer should consider and review the sentence as soon aspossible after it has been passed, and that he should,- if he thinkslit, exercise in. relation thereto his existing powers to mitigate,remit or commute.(/) That the Department of the Adjutant-General in the War Office, andof the Air Member for Personnel in the Air Ministry, which atpresent review sentences by court-martial periodically during the currency of the sentence, should continue to do so.(g) That the right of the convicted person to petition against his sentenceto any reviewing authority, including the King, should be preserved.

By Subordinate CommandersA commanding officer or detachment commander having the full powersof a commanding officer may delegate power to subordinate commanders to dispose of any offence which he himself may dispose of, provided that thepunishments which may be awarded by company, etc., commanders in the* Note A commanding officer or detachment commander if of or below the rank ofcaptain (or flight lieutenant) may not normally award detention exceeding seven days,except for offences of absence without leave in excess of seven days, for which he mayaward detention up to 28 days but not exceeding the number of days of absence.
Army and by an officer of or below the rank of flight lieutenant in the RoyalAir Force do not exceed the following:  (a) To a non-commissioned officer below the rank of serjeant reprimandor admonition.(b) To a private soldier or aircraftman seven days&apos; confinement tobarracks (or camp), extra guards and piquets, fines for drunken-ness, and admonition.A commanding officer may further limit the powers of punishmentdelegated to subordinate commanders.166. We have considered these punishments from the following stand-points :  (a) The suitability of the punishments themselves;(b) Comparison  between  punishments   awarded   to   officers,   warrant officers and other ranks;(c) Powers of commanding officers.167. Subject to any changes which may become necessary consequent upon the Criminal Justice Bill becoming law we do not think that any change is required with regard to penal servitude, imprisonment and detention.Ample powers exist under section 57 of the Army and Air Force Acts to mitigate, remit or commute sentences which appear to higher commanders tobe unduly harsh, and under section 57A of the same Acts to suspend sentenceswhen it appears to the superior military authority that it is in the interests ofthe Service and of the person- sentenced to do so. This latter power was, weunderstand, widely used during the late war with excellent results. More-over, provision has now been made in the Army and Air Force (Annual)Act, 1947, for Military Corrective Establishments, &apos; the purpose of whichwill be to make better soldiers and airmen, and better citizens, of thoseundergoing punishment. This development will, we think, meet the views ofsome of those who gave evidence before us to the effect that something inthe nature of a probation system was required in the Services.168. The summary and minor punishments for other ranks, set out above,so far as they go, have stood the test of time and we do not think that anyrecent Service changes or&apos; war-time experience warrant alteration in theircharacter, or in the^ method of awarding them. Their administration is, inpractice, bound up with day-to-day service life. When discipline and leader-ship in the unit is good the results are good and, conversely, bad results, ifthey occur, are due to failures in leadership and not, we think, to defects inthe system.169. It.is, however, very noticeable when comparing the military withthe civil code that there is no general provision for fines as a punishment.Under Sections 137 and 138 of the Army and Air Force Acts, pay is for-feited for each day of absence, and stoppages of pay can be inflicted to make good damage or loss, but fines are not authorised in the sense in whichthey are understood under the civil code for any military offence savedrunkenness, which is comparatively rare in the Services to-day.170. The military code of punishment in its present form dates from 1881,a period when cash was far less plentiful among the population at large andwhen the offences for which soldiers or officers needed to be punished were no doubt simpler and fewer. It is not therefore, perhaps, surprising thatfines were levied only for drunkenness, an offence which the lack of cashwould obviously minimize.
21171. In this respect, we think, a new situation has arisen. Service pay is higher and with compulsory service in peace-time there will always beserving in the ranks persons from all classes of the community. We deallater with the problem of officers. Offences by other ranks may well bebetter dealt with in some cases by a fine than by restrictions on their personalliberty. Such restrictions are wasteful in that they occupy the time of others who have to supervise the punishment, e.g., orderly serjeants or non-com-missioned officers in charge of defaulters or the staff of Military Prisons andDetention Barracks. It is possible that offences connected with equipment and breaches of signal or transport discipline are better dealt with by fines,and that the improving education of the soldier may cause him to respondbetter, in many instances, to such a punishment.172. We recommend, therefore, that &quot; reduction to a penal rate of pay &quot;under that name should be introduced as a punishment for appropriate cases.We do not consider ourselves called on to advise on its details, but we thinkthat in framing such a system the following principles should be observed:  (a) The scheme should be framed in such a way as not to hit those&quot; behind the soldier &quot;, that is to say, it must not be allowed to prejudice allotments of pay or dependants&apos; allowances so long asthe man is not an absentee or deserter.   .(b) It must leave the man with a reasonable minimum sum to be drawnat the pay table. - In this respect is should be related to the existingscale of deductions for recovery of sums overpaid.(c) There should be a right to elect trial by court-martial.We consider that the power to award reduction to a penal rate of pay should rest with the same officers who are now empowered to award detention,namely, those with powers of a commanding officer or detachment com-mander, and with a court-martial.173. We have given considerable thought to the problem of officers&apos;punishments which is more complex than that of punishment for other ranks.174. The present punishments are cashiering (whether or not accompaniedby penal servitude or imprisonment), dismissal, forfeiture of seniority, severereprimand and reprimand, and also deductions from pay to make goodlosses and damage. There is a big gap between the severe and the moretrivial punishments, which we cannot believe arose accidentally. It is pro-bably due, we imagine, to the view that an officer who committed a seriousoffence thereby lost the confidence of the troops and was therefore not worthcontinuing in His Majesty&apos;s service. The wording of section 44 of the Armyand Air Force Acts supports this view.175. We wish to make it clear beyond doubt that nothing in modernService developments leads us to think that a lower standard of conduct shouldbe now accepted for officers than was accepted in the past. A momenfsconsideration of the officer&apos;s place as a leader in battle will dispose of anysuch idea. For this reason, if for no other, we have rejected a suggestion,made in evidence given before us, that punishments for officers and other ranksshould be similar.176. A number of offences have, however, made their appearance in theArmy and Royal Air Force which are not serious enough to warrant dis-missal or cashiering, and yet are too serious to be adequately punished byless punishment such as a reprimand. Some of the offences connected withvehicles, with security or with accounts and stores come within this category.
, i77- We are not in favour of restrictions on an officers liberty, such asconfinement to quarters, nor of introducing stoppage of leave into the dis-ciplinary code as a punishment for officers. Indeed, leave is a privilege andnot a right, and the granting of leave should be regulated within the neces-necessities of the Service by the need to maintain efficiency. Confinement toquarters and similar punishments are not, in general, consistent with theexercise of leadership. For this good reason they are not at present awardedto warrant or non-commissioned officers, and we are not in favour of their being awarded to officers. . -&apos;178. Forfeiture of&apos; seniority is provided for by sections 44 and 47 ofthe Army and Air Force Acts and is, we think, a punishment welladapted for regular officers under peace-time conditions, as indeed it isfor regular warrant and non-commissioned officers. Its financial effect onthe individual is easy to gauge, in that the delay in time promotion, where this applies, and the loss in qualifying service for retired pay or gratuity canbe accurately estimated before a sentence is passed.179. If, in addition to forfeiture of seniority, there were introduced for officers a system of &quot; reduction to a penal rate of pay &quot; such as we have proposed for other ranks, the result would be a more flexible system of punishment.-180. We have also considered whether reduction in rank should be intro-duced as a punishment. - It is not now provided for in the Army or Air ForceAct and if introduced would in all probability be rarely made use of, par-ticularly for regular officers; but after discussion with authoritative witnesseswe have come to the conclusion that it would be desirable to introduce itas a punishment awardable by court-martial, and we believe that its existencewould prove a wholesome deterrent, particularly for non-regular officers.181. The problem of punishment for non-regular-officers, as well as for the short service officer in the Royal Air Force, is much more difficult that inthe case of the regular officer, and the problem for officers as a whole muchmore difficult in war than in peace.182. The non-regular officer has generally no expectation of retired pay,nor as a rule in the Army, of time promotion above the rank of lieutenant;and forfeiture of seniority, therefore, has no substantial effect on him. Inwar-time, a system of acting and temporary ranks is put into force and forthis reason also forfeiture of rank or seniority might prove to be no realpunishment, except in so far as it would involve loss of prestige.183. Probably, therefore, of the new punishments which it is possible to devise to fill the present gap between dismissal and severe reprimand, only that of reduction to a penal rate of pay is likely to have a wide application.Loss of rank is, however, in our opinion useful as a deterrent, for whichreason we recommend its introduction.184. We have considered whether the summary powers of commandersand commanding officers require alteration.185. If our recommendations are accepted in regard to reduction to apenal rate of pay for officers or warrant officers, power should be givenfor a summary award of this punishment under section 47 of the Acts,subject to the right of the accused to elect trial by court-martial.186. Apart from this we do not recommend any changes in commanders&apos;powers.
187. As to the powers of cornmanding officers, we have heard evidencefor and against their extension, but have come to the conclusion that whilethe existing powers are necessary and should not be reduced, there is no&apos;good case for their extension generally.188. It is possible that a case might be made out for the extension of summary powers in cases of desertion or absence without leave exceeding21 days which call for an award of no more than, say, 56 days&apos; detention but,on balance, we do not favour a change. While it may be true that in peace-time commanding officers are usually sufficiently experienced to awardsentences above the present limit of 28 days&apos; detention, subject always to theright of the accused to elect trial by court-martial, the same cannot be said ofcommanding officers in war-time, some of whom will have received quickpromotion because of their qualities in battle, while others, such as those in command of technical or administrative units may well be men of littleexperience in command of troops. It would not, in our opinion, be practicable to distinguish between one commanding officer and another in regard topowers of punishment.189. If, however, reduction to a penal rate of pay is introduced, com-manding officers should, we consider, be authorised to award reductions fora period of 14 days, subject to the right of the accused to elect trial by court-martial.190. We do not recommend any change in the powers of subordinatecommanders in regard to minor punishments, and we are satisfied that thereis no general demand for such a change either in the Army or the Royal AirForce.CHAPTER VICOURTS-MARTIAL FOR THE future the Committee&apos;s Observations and Recommendations191. The Army Act, and the Rules of Procedure made thereunder, con-template, quite understandably, that trials by court-martial will normally be conducted by officers having no legal qualifications and with little, if any,experience of the proceedings before, an ordinary criminal court. It is onlyin the case of a General Court-Martial that the law requires that a judge advocate must be appointed to advise and assist the court, and he neednot be legally qualified. Rule of Procedure 101 merely lays down that he-must be &quot; a fit person to act as judge advocate &quot;. Hence presumably the safeguards (a)- of confirmation before the findings and sentences can becomevalid, and (&amp;) of subsequent reviews by staffs and legal advisers of higherformations, and finally in the Office of the Judge Advocate General. Thesereviews, during which some flaw in the proceedings may be detected, areautomatic in the sense that no action on the part of the convicted person isrequired to set them in motion. A convicted person may, however, submitany number of petitions, and each petition entails a further review or seriesof reviews. The Oliver Committee in its Report stated that this systemprovides &quot; a series of safeguards at least equal to those which apply in the;case of civilians convicted of crime in the civil courts &quot;..
192. The expenditure of time and labour which the system; involves is,however, prodigious especially in time of war. As one witness put it,&apos;&apos; The number of reviews a set of proceedings may receive is astounding. If&quot; a court is convened at Brigade level the proceedings may well receive a&quot; review at Brigade Headquarters, another at Divisional Headquarters,&quot; another at Corps Headquarters, another at Army Headquarters, and yet&quot;another at General Headquarters before reaching the War Office. In&quot;addition they may receive legal reviews from members of the Judge&quot; Advocate General&apos;s staff- at .four different levels culminating with the&quot; review in London. It should be noted too that in the higher formations&quot; each review may entail the reading of the proceedings and the making of a&quot; minute by perhaps three different staff officers each feeling it incumbent&quot; upon him to write something for the benefit of his immediate superior &quot;.193. Some idea of the demands upon time and labour of this systemduring the last war can be formed when it is stated that the number of courts-martial held in the Army and the Royal Air Force in that period reached atotal of 203,595, over 53,000 being held during the year ending 1st September,1945-194. Another unsatisfactory feature of the present system is that thestandard of knowledge and experience of the District Court-Martial, asnormally constituted, that is without the assistance of a judge advocate, is not now equal to all the tasks that are imposed upon it. Today there is atendency, which is certain to increase, for the prosecution and the defence tobe conducted by legally qualified persons, resulting in disputes on law and procedure upon which it is unfair to ask a lay court to adjudicate.195. The position of the judge advocate at a trial by court-martial is alsoanomalous and unsatisfactory. At present the members of a court-martialare judges both of law and of fact, and on matters of law and procedure the judge advocate is merely an adviser. On the other hand he has, like a Judgeat an Assize Court, the important duty of summing up. He has, therefore,considerable responsibility but no power, and can make no decision. Hisvery title is also a handicap, but we have dealt with this already.196. In our view all these defects can be removed, and the value of thecourt-martial system, as an instrument of justice, at the same time enhanced.The way to do this is to reconstitute General Courts-Martial and DistrictCourts-Martial in the manner indicated below and to provide a right of oralappeal against conviction as already recommended. These changes will go fartowards relieving the ordinary officer of responsibility for deciding, disputedquestions of law, for which he seldom has the necessary knowledge and experience, arid at the same time render the existing procedure of confirma-tion and automatic review of conviction with all its demands upon time andlabour unnecessary.197., We accordingly make the following recommendations:  General Courts-Martial.In future these should be composed of a Judge Martial, or Deputy judge martial, and five officers, having the eligibility and qualifications at presentrequired for membership of a General Court-Martial except that of havingheld a commission for a minimum period of three years. We were informedthat this essential qualification had been found in time of war to be undulyrestrictive, especially in the case of officers holding emergency commissionswho, by reason of experience in civil life, would have been eminently suitable
for appointment as members. We understand this was one of the reasons why Field General Courts-Martial were so frequently resorted to in the last war. We think, however, that no officer should be eligible unless he is atleast of the rank of lieutenant in the Army or of flying officer in the Royal AirForce, in order to ensure that he has a reasonable amount of Serviceexperience.198. The Judge Martial or Deputy Judge Martial would be the president and act in all respects as a Judge at an Assize Court. In other words hewould be the sole judge of questions of law arising during the trial which hewould decide, when necessary or desirable, in the absence of the othermembers of the court. He would sum up the case and his direction on thelaw would be binding upon the court. The officers would be the sole judges,of whether the accused was guilty of the offence charged or not in other words they would discharge, to this extent, the same function as a jury in a civil criminal court. When the officers retire to consider their finding theyshould retire alone, i.e., the president should not retire with them. Whenthey retire a second time, however, after hearing any plea in mitigation, todecide upon sentence, we think that the president might well retire with them.His experience would be of value to the other members of the court in securing a desirable degree of uniformity of sentence, and this being so, we think he ought to be entitled to vote upon the question, and, if the votes are equallydivided, to have a casting vote.199. The finding should be announced in open court forthwith upon its.determination and should be so announced by the senior officer in reply to.a question by the president as to whether the military members of the courtwere agreed upon their finding, and if so, whether they found the accusedguilty or not guilty of the offence charged. The sentence should be pro-nounced in open court forthwith upon its determination and should be soannounced by the president as being the sentence of the court. It shouldnot require confirmation for its validity, although, as we have alreadyrecommended, the power of the Service authorities to mitigate,&apos; remit orcommute the sentence should be preserved. In these circumstances it wouldbe desirable to provide that the sentence should not be put into executionuntil the convening officer had approved it, so as to provide an immediateopportunity for someone in authority to decide whether the power to mitigate,remit or commute the sentence should be exercised. Such an opportunityis particularly desirable in cases where a person is sentenced to be cashieredor dismissed or discharged with ignominy.200. The accused should have the right to appeal against the finding ofthe court, as distinct from its sentence, on the lines already indicated.201. There should be no change in the jurisdiction and powers of a.General Court-Martial. In saying this, however, we are expressing noopinion as to whether or not the power of the court to inflict the punishmentof death should be retained, which we regard as outside the scope of out enquiry.202. When sitting as president of a General Court-Martial, the judge martial or the Deputy Judge Martial, as the case may be, should wear thesame robes as a King&apos;s Counsel.District Courts-Martial.203. The majority of cases which are tried by District Court-Martialrelate to comparatively trivial offences meriting not more than six months&apos;imprisonment, e.g., purely military offences and petty thefts, and many ofthese are cases in which the accused has elected to be tried by court-martial
rather than accept his commanding officers award. Some serious offences of desertion are also brought before this court, but are not difficult to try,though they deserve more severe punishment than six months&apos; imprisonment.Cases coming before a District Court-Martial which raise difficult questionsof law, or where the offence is serious enough to merit a sentence up to thelimit of its powers, i,e., two years&apos; imprisonment, are a minority of the total.204. The considerations which have led us to recommend that a general court-Martial should always have a trained lawyer as a president do notapply with the same force in the case of a District Court-Martial. Any case which might otherwise be tried by the latter court, but which is seen toraise difficult questions of law or complicated technical matters, can always be tried instead by a General Court-Martial. It is not really necessary tohave a trained lawyer to preside over the hundreds of simple straight-forward cases that are dealt with by District Courts-Martial every year.Moreover, in practice such a rule would probably be unworkable owing tothe difficulty in securing such presidents in sufficient numbers. What isrequired for such cases is a system which will give a reasonably competentcourt, capable of being convened with the least difficulty under all con-ditions, with safeguards in favour of the accused such as a limitation on thepower of the court in the matter of punishment, and a right of appeal againstconviction. In more serious cases, however, where &apos; the court should havepower to inflict the maximum punishment open to a District Court-Martial(i.e., two years&apos; imprisonment) these safeguards should be supplemented bya rule requiring that the president of the court should be a person with suitable legal qualifications.205. With regard to the trial of comparatively simple cases, the first question is who should be the president of the court. We would recall thatduring the last war there grew up a practice of selecting a number of officers for continuous duty as presidents of Field General or District Courts-Martial.They were known as &quot; Permanent Presidents &quot;. These officers, though notnecessarily legally qualified, acquired through practice a sound workingknowledge of military law and procedure. We are informed that cases whichcome before courts-martial presided over by them were generally well tried,and that the scheme has operated successfully both in the Army and in theRoyal Air Force.206. In the future, as in the past, owing to the narrowing pyramid of promotion in the higher ranks, many officers in the Army and in the RoyalAir Force will retire at a time when they are still fit and active and arepossessed of valuable Service experience. In such cases, all this goes to wasteso far as the Services are concerned. It would be possible from among these officers to select a number for the position of permanent president to be held for a period of three to five years (say) from the date when they would other-wise retire. For this appointment they could be given a&apos; short course in military law and procedure. We recommend, therefore, that for the cases nowbeing considered (subject to the next paragraph) the officer to preside overa District Court-Martial should be such a permanent president.207. An adequate number of such permanent presidents should be borne on the peace-time establishments of the Army and the Royal Air Force. Butas there are bound to be occasions when such a president is not available itshould not be made a rule of law that only an officer holding the appointmentof permanent president should preside over a District Court-Martial. those officers at present eligible to oreside should continue to be so, but should notbe appointed president of a District Court-Martial unless the convening officer
-    216certifies that a permanent president is not available, or that the case is ofsuch a nature that a president with up-to-date technical qualifications isrequired.208. We further recommend that the jurisdiction of a District Court-Martial which is not presided over by an Assistant Judge Martial (see para-graph 213 below) should be limited to those military or air force offences forwhich the maximum punishment prescribed by the Army and Air Force Actsis imprisonment: and to soldiers and airmen below the rank of warrant officer.JSfo offence under section 41 of the said Acts should be triable by such a court.209. A District Court-Martial presided over as aforesaid should havepower to inflict any punishment authorised by the said Acts up to but&apos; notexceeding six months&apos; imprisonment for any one offence, with an overridingmaximum of twelve months for two or more offences. In the case of a singlecharge of desertion; however, the aforesaid maximum of six months might beextended to a maximum of twelve months.210. Two other officers (at least) should sit with the president of the court,as is the case at present. The existing requirement that an officer must have held a commission for two years in order to be eligible to serve on a DistrictCourt-Martial might, however, be dispensed with in war-time, or when thecourt is presided over by a permanent president or by an Assistant judge martial (as to which see below).211. A District Court-Martial, constituted and functioning as above, will,in our opinion, provide a satisfactory means of trial of the less serious cases,both in the Army and in the Royal Air Force. We accordingly recommend it for this purpose.212. Coming now to the comparatively few more serious and difficultcases that come before a District Court-Martial, we recommend that thepresident should be a person legally qualified and having practical experience in criminal proceedings. We are informed that in such cases it is now thepractice, under the present system, to appoint a judge advocate to advise and assist the court; but if the recommendations we have made elsewhere in thisReport are accepted, judge advocates will cease to exist.213. The president of the court convened to try the more serious cases should, in our opinion, be an Assistant Judge Martial appointed ad hoc bythe convening officer to whom the necessary powers for this purpose shouldbe given, to be exercised in his discretion. Such a president should sit with at least two other officers and we refer in this connection to what we have said in paragraph 210 above. There would be no summing-up and thepresident would have an equal voice with the other members of the courtas regards finding and sentence. The convening officer should have powerto appoint as president of a District Court-Martial any serving officer who may be on the panel referred to in paragraph 217 (6) below.214. The jurisdiction and powers of a District Court-Martial which ispresided over by an Assistant Judge Martial should remain as they are atpresent. We have carefully considered a suggestion that officers should be tried by District Court-Martial, but, in our opinion, the interests of disciplinewould not be served by such a change and we do not recommend it.215. In all trials by District Court-Martial, whoever may be the presidentof the court: - (a) Finding and sentence should be pronounced in open court forthwithupon their determination.
(b) The Court should be judge of both law and fact but there shouldbe a right of appeal (with leave) against conviction, as recom-mended in Chapter IV. If such a right of appeal is given, thesystem of &quot; confirmation &quot;and legal review of the proceedingsshould be abolished.(c) The sentence should be reviewed with the minimum delay by an authority having power to mitigate, remit or commute thethe sentence with a view to deciding whether or not to exercise such power: and the sentence should not be put into effect in themeantime.216. It has been suggested to us that the number of trials by DistrictCourt-Martial might be greatly reduced by:  (a) increasing the powers: of commanding officers; or(6) introducing a system of &quot; Military Magistrates &quot;, sitting alone.We do not recommend an increase in the powers of commanding officers for the reasons given in paragraph 188. The second alternative needs someexplanation and we deal with it at the end of the present chapter.Generally.217. Certain considerations of a general kind affecting the foregoing pio-posals must be mentioned.   They are as follows:  (a) In order to remove any doubt, we would say that our recommenda-tions in paragraphs 125 and 126 of this Report that findings ofguilt or innocence should be unanimous, but that sentences shouldcontinue to be decided by a majority, apply to the courts recon-stituted as above.(6) Occasion will in all probability arise, both at home and abroad,when no Judge Martial, Deputy Judge Martial or Assistant judge martial is available to preside at a General or District Court-Martial as the case may be. We therefore recommend that apanel should be formed by the Chief Judge Martial, with theapproval of the Lord Chancellor, of practising counsel in theUnited Kingdom willing to act as presidents of such courts-martialat home or abroad. When the occasion arises the selection of amember of the panel to preside at a General or District Court-Martial should be made by the Chief Judge Martial or his Deputy,and the person selected should be appointed ad hoc a DeputyJudge Martial (in the case of a General Court-Martial) or an assistant Judge Marshal (in the case of a District Court-Martial)and a suitable fee should be paid.In the colonies, local judges and counsel might be willing toserve on such a panel.(c) There will also be occasions in time of war, or even in times ofpeace, in remote stations or on board ship, when the necessitywill arise to hold a General Court-Martial or a District Court-Martial presided over by an Assistant Judge Martial without delay,but it will be impossible to secure the services of Judge Martialor Assistant Judge Martial. Provision must, therefore, be madefor such cases. This brings us to a consideration of the FieldGeneral Court-Martial, by which, under the existing system, anemergency which makes it impossible to&apos; convene the normal typeof court is met.
21The Field General Court-Martial.218. We have already described this court in paragraph 37 of our Report.During the war, owing partly to the difficulties frequently encountered in securing officers with the necessary qualifications (i.e., three years&apos; com-missioned service in the case of a General Court-Martial and two in the caseof a District Court-Martial) to enable them to sit, many cases which would otherwise have been tried by General or District Court-Martial were triedinstead by Field General Court-Martial.219. We do not believe that such a state of affairs was contemplated bythe Legislature, in authorizing trial by Field General Court-Martial when in the opinion of the convening officer &quot;it is not practicable that the offenceshould be tried by an ordinary General Court-Martial &quot;. (See section 49of the Army Act.) Bearing in mind that a Field General Court-Martial mayconsist of three officers only (or exceptionally two), that any officer with atleast one year&apos;s commissioned service can sit on the court, and that the court,when composed of three officers, can inflict sentences of penal servitude anddeath, it is obvious that stringent precautions are necessary to ensure thatthis court is convened only in a real emergency, and when it is genuinelyimpracticable to convene a normal type of court-martial. These considera-tions were, we think, largely overlooked during the recent war.220. The need to retain a distinctive type of court-martial, such as theField General Court-Martial, for an emergency is inescapable. Assume,for example, the case of a beleaguered garrison, such as the garrison which heldTobruk in the last war.- A soldier in the garrison assaults an officer. Itis obviously necessary in the interests of justice and discipline that the soldier should be tried without delay, and if found guilty should be punished.A similar problem may arise upon a troopship at sea, many hundreds of milesfrom land. It clearly is not possible to convene a General or District Court-Martial, complete with a Judge Martial or Assistant Judge Martial as president. Some kind of emergency court-martial is. therefore, a necessity.In these circumstances we make the following recommendations: .(a) The Field General Court-Martial should be retained.    In order to impress on all concerned, however, that it is an emergency court,and not a court to be convened merely because it-is convenient todo so, the name should be changed to &quot;Emergency Court-Martial&quot;.(b) The provisions of the Army Act relating to persons having power to convene a Field General Court-Martial, to the circumstances inwhich the court may be convened, to the composition of the court,and to its jurisdiction and powers of punishment, should applyto an Emergency Court-Martial: with the qualification that thecourt should be permitted only when it is not &quot; possible &quot; (i.e.,as distinct from &quot; practicable &quot;) to convene a General Court-Martial or a. District Court-Martial presided over by an AssistantJudge Martial as the case may be. The fact that a body oftroops is on active service should no longer be regarded as, initself, a sufficient justification for recourse to an Emergency Court-Martial.(c) Findings of guilt or innocence should be unanimousL but sentencesshould continue to be decided by a majority. Such finding andsentence should be announced in open court forthwith upon their determination, but should require for their validity the confirma-tion of the senior officer in the vicinity, not being an officer whoserved on the court. Such officer should have power to mitigate,remit or commute the sentence.
(d) The accused person should have the right to appeal against convictionby submitting an application in writing to the officer commandinghis unit. This application should be forwarded as soon as circum-stances permit to the Deputy Chief Judge Martial of the formationof which the unit forms part, or if this is impracticable or mightoccasion undue delay, direct to the Chief Judge Martial in London.If leave is granted the appeal fo be heard as soon as circumstances permit.(e) No Emergency Court-Martial to be held in peace-time in the UnitedKingdom.221. There is a type .of case where further special provision will benecessary. Assume the case of a force cut off from the main body of thearmy and a soldier in that force is found to be in treacherous communicationwith the enemy. He is tried by Emergency Court-Martial, is found guilty andsentenced to death. It may be essential in the interests of the discipline and safety of the force that the sentence shall be carried out forthwith. To meet this type of case we suggest the following procedure:The convening officer, plus the next two senior officers in the forcewho did not sit upon the court-martial should consider, after hearing the accused if he so desires, the validity of the conviction, and the appro-priateness of the sentence. If they unanimously affirm the conviction andunanimously come to the conclusion, to be certified by them in writing,that both the interests of discipline and safety of the force imperativelyrequire that the sentence should be carried out iorthwith, then it may be immediately put into execution.222. We recognise that this is an instance where the necessity of the casewill override all other considerations. Nevertheless, such cases are likely to bevery few and far between, and it may be informative if we here state that thetotal number of death sentences carried out in the Army and in the Royal AirForce during the recent war was 36.223. It may occasionally happen that a person convicted by EmergencyCourt-Martial may secure the quashing of the conviction on appeal, but in themeantime will have served his sentence. It is impracticable, however (just as it is in civil life) to provide that sentences shall be automatically suspendedupon the lodging of a notice to appeal. Some of the other effects of a con-viction, e.g., loss of rank or pay, would, however, be corrected as the resultof a successful appeal.224. It is true, of course, that an Emergency Court-Martial, constituted andfunctioning as above proposed, will mean that to this extent the old system(with the addition of a right of appeal) will co-exist with the new, if our recommendations as to other courts-martial are put into effect. This should not create any great difficulty, and the very differences between an EmergencyCourt-Martial and every other type of court-martial should serve as a continualreminder that it is to be convened only when the normal court is impossible.One Type of Court-Martial only.225. We considered a suggestion that there should be one type of court-martial only. It would have the full power of a General Court-Martial and exercise jurisdiction over officers and other ranks and try all offences.226. Superficially the proposal is attractive, but in our opinion it is impracticable. In the first place it would in war-time, and in peace-time onisolated stations, frequently be impossible to convene a General Court-Martial
constituted as we propose, and resort to an emergency type of court would, aswe have just pointed out, be unavoidable. At the outset, therefore, the idea ofone court for ail offences breaks down. There are other objections. Thus incivil life the idea of one court for all offences with High Court Judges presidingwould be recognised at once as impracticable. There would not be enoughJudges to go round, and in any event it would be a waste of legal resources toput Judges on to trying trivial cases. In civil life, therefore, we find Petty&apos;Sessions, Quarter Sessions for Counties, Quarter Sessions for Boroughs, andAssizes. In principle the same objection would apply to the suggestion of asingle court-martial, though naturally in less degree. It would be a waste ofthe time of senior officers and of legal personnel to make them deal with alloffences, however trivial.Other Ranks to Serve on Courts-Martial.227. We also considered a suggestion that in future other ranks should serve as members of courts-martial.228. The first proposal was that if a private were being tried, anotherprivate should be a member of the court. Such a private would, however,if he were a national serviceman, normally be 18 or 19 years of age orthereabouts, and be possessed of very little Service experience. If, however,he were a regular soldier, .and had several years&apos; Service experience hewould be a soldier who, in spite of this, had failed to gain promotion to non-commissioned rank. The suggestion that either of these persons should serve upon a court-martial would not, we think, be generally acceptable:and indeed after pointing out the difficulty in question, we heard no satis-factory answer to it.229. The next proposal was that if a private soldier were being tried by a District Court-Martial he should have the right to require that one member of the court should be a non-commissioned officer of the rank of full corporal: that a corporal being tried should similarly be entitled toelect that one member of the court should be another corporal; and aSerjeant another serjeant and so on. The non-commissioned officer to situpon the court should be selected by his own commanding officer.230. The basis of the proposal was that just as in civil criminal courtsa man &quot; is tried by his peers &quot; so also, subject to the requirements of dis-decipline, should he be tried in the Services. Another suggested reason was thata mixed court of the kind proposed would be less of a &quot; class &quot; court thanone composed entirely of officers. Other witnesses said that if, for example,a corporal were being tried for an offence it would be an advantage to havea member of the court who would understand more about a corporal&apos;s lifeas such than an officer could be expected to do.231. If trial by one&apos;s &quot; peers &quot; means trial by one&apos;s equal in rank, thenno such thing exists in civil life. If a civilian is tried by Justices either inPetty or Quarter Sessions he has no right to require that one member of thecourt shall be of the same rank in life as himself, or of the same occupation.Nor has he any such right in relation to a jury if he is tried at Assizes. More-over, the proposal now being considered would grant trial by one&apos;s &quot; peers &quot;(in this sense) to all non-commissioned and warrant officers above the rank of lance-corporal, but deny it to the much larger number of lance-corporalsand privates. We feel, therefore, that if the proposal is to be justified it mustbe on some other ground than the suggested analogy with civil rights.
232. We have considered the suggestion in relation to three questions.First, would it tend to improve the quality of the court? Second, would it tend to improve the prospect, or the appearance, of justice being done?Third, would it tend to improve or impair discipline?233. In considering the first question we do not limit ourselves to DistrictCourts-Martial. If the proposal be a good one it seems to us it would be equally good for all kinds of court-martial. The prime consideration here is to select the best kind of court, and one offering the greatest prospectof doing justice. This problem necessarily has to be dealt with on general lines. It would not be possible on each occasion when a court-martialhad to be convened to conduct a preliminary enquiry as to who, of the personsavailable, and irrespective of rank, were best fitted by training and tem-perament to sit upon the court. But in general, those who have attainedcommissioned rank, are by their education, training and experience best fittedfor this duty. It cannot reasonably be asserted that the quality of the court would necessarily be improved by the addition of a non-commissioned officerselected by the accused&apos;s commanding officer or the accused himself.234. Would the prospect of justice being done, however, be therebyimproved? Assuming a corporal were being tried, a court whose members were ignorant of a corporal&apos;s duties and difficulties, and the general conditionsof his life as such, might be less likely to do justice than a court possessed of such knowledge. In the days when all officers came into the Army fromSandhurst or Woolwich or the public schools, there may have been some soout of touch with the lives of the non-commissioned officers and men underthem that they ought not to sit in judgment upon them: though they wouldbe bad officers if this were the case. But today, when nearly all officers have to graduate from the ranks, the danger in question is a remote risk.Furthermore, as the scheme for legal aid in the Army develops, more andmore accused persons will be legally represented: and one of the things anyreasonably competent defending solicitor or counsel would not fail to do would be to remind the court by evidence or otherwise of any difficultiespeculiar to the accused&apos;s rank or duties which it was relevant to consider.235. So far as concerns the appearance of justice being done this doesnot, in our view, depend primarily upon the composition of a court. it depends upon the way the court discharges its duties: whether it is patient,impartial, ready to assist the accused where it is proper that he should be assisted, in a word whether the court is judicial. It depends &apos;also upon therights which the particular system of trial accords to the accused, and the safeguards which it provides in his favour. The presence of a person of equal rank to the accused upon the court per se affects none of these matters.236. As to discipline, the proposal in question seriously perturbed the senior officers of the Army and the Royal Air Force to whom it was put.Their view was that it might have a very damaging effect upon discipline;and their opinion was all the more impressive because in relation to almost every other change which we have recommended in this Report, we found theiroutlook both enlightened - and progressive. As regards this particularsuggestion, however, they said that in the Services discipline is finally in thehands of officers, and that courts-martial, which are one of the instruments of discipline, should be wholly manned by officers. They also attached greatimportance, now that officers are graduating from the ranks, to maintainingstrictly the status an officer has hitherto enjoyed.
237- We report, therefore:-(a) That the proposal would not tend to improve the quality of the court,nor the prospect or appearance of justice being done.(6) That senior officers in the Army and in the Royal Air Force considerthat the proposal, if carried into effect, would impair discipline.238. Certain difficulties would in any event arise. For example, from what unit should the non-commissioned officer in question be selected? to try a fellow non-commissioned officer would be an invidious task to impose upon a non-commissioned officer from the same unit as the accused. Yetif the selection is made from some other unit, the court would not have thebenefit of the knowledge of local conditions, etc., which is one of thearguments by which the proposal is supported. Again assume, as might happen, that a warrant officer, Serjeant and corporal are being jointly tried.What then should be the composition of the court?239. These, however, are procedural difficulties, and no doubt could be overcome. The fundamental objections are that in the emphatic opinionof those who ought to know the suggested innovation would damage dis-decipline, and that in our opinion it would not improve the administration ofjustice. In fact there would be a danger that the non-commissioned officerselected to sit would tend to regard himself as being on the court in a repre-sentative rather than in a judicial capacity.240. For these reasons, we do not recommend the proposal.Military Magistrates.241. Finally in this chapter we refer to a proposal that a number of&quot; military magistrates &quot; should be appointed.     The main virtues of theproposal are the saving of manpower and speed of trial.242. At the outset we should say that if the term &quot; magistrate &quot; isthought to have too civilian a connotation, we are not wedded to it. It isthe word which we happen to have used during our discussions, and no more.Some other suitable title could no doubt be found.243. Briefly, the scheme would be to locate at the Headquarters of a command or lower formation a number of military magistrates who would beavailable to travel to any unit in the Command or formation and there holda summary trial. These magistrates would be officers who had had experienceas commanding officers and had undergone a special course of training in military law and procedure to fit them for these duties. Convening officers would be given a discretion, unless the accused had elected trial by DistrictCourt-Martial, to remit cases referred to them by commanding officers forsummary trial by a military magistrate. Military magistrates would try onlythe less serious cases and their powers of punishment would be limited.They would not try officers or warrant officers. No confirmation would berequired but a right of appeal against conviction to the Courts-Martial appeal court would be given, subject to leave being obtained.244. This scheme found support from Army witnesses on the groundthat it would make for a speedy trial and be conservative of manpower.In their view, moreover, particularly as there would be a right of appealwith leave, the risk of injustice being done by a one-man court was small.They pointed out that many officers of the rank of lieutenant-colonel haveto retire at a time when they are fit and active and have many years of experience in responsible positions behind them.   Military magistrates could
245. Senior officers in the Royal Air Force were not enamoured of theproposal. In general they did not like the idea of a one-man court, andin particular they did not wish to grant to such a magistrate such a high rankas air commodore. This they thought would be necessary inasmuch asin the Royal Air Force many commanding officers hold the rank of groupcaptain. They were also averse to the idea of military magistrates tryingairmen subject to military law while temporarily attached to the Army an objection with which we would agree. .246. Other witnesses thought that cases which were too serious to bedealt with summarily by a commanding officer should not be dealt withsummarily by another slightly senior officer sitting alone and with consider-ably greater powers of punishment, as such a procedure would cast grave doubts on the qualifications of the commanding officer.247. A somewhat similar scheme was put into operation in the CanadianArmy during the last war but applied only in Canada. There was establishedby Order in Council under the Canadian War Measures Act a &quot; StandingCourt-Martial &quot; consisting of a number of officers being qualified lawyers.Any one member of the Standing Court-Martial was empowered to exerciseall the jurisdiction, powers,, duties and functions of the Standing Court-Martial, which, subject to the power of limitation by the Minister of NationalDefence, were the same as those of a General, District or Field General Court-Martial. Originally the Standing Court-Martial had jurisdiction over all officers and other ranks, but later this was limited by the Minister topersonnel under warrant rank. Powers of punishment extended to penal servitude, and the court was empowered to try all offences.248. We were informed that there were some 25 members of the StandingCourt-Martial. They were officers of field rank and called presidents.They were posted to various Military Districts in accordance with the needsof the District concerned.249. The procedure was briefly as follows:  No summary of evidence was required. Instead the commanding officersubmitted a &quot; Precis of Evidence &quot; setting out the nature of the evidence available to prove the charge or charges set out in the charge sheet. Whencases were reported to the District Headquarters from a particular area, atrained prosecutor went to that area and prepared the case. A president,accompanied by a qualified court reporter, followed a few days later. Thepresident sat, as a one-man court, in that area until all the cases listed forthat&apos; sitting were disposed of. In each area a special court room furnished with a bench, witness stand, etc., was provided. Findings and sentenceswere announced in open court, became immediately effective, and no con-firmation was required. The proceedings went from the president first tothe Judge Advocate General of Canada for legal review, and then to theGeneral Officer Commanding or District or Camp Commander in whoseCommand, District or Camp the trial took place, for review cf the sentence.250. The advantage claimed for this system is that military justice is administered speedily by trained personnel legally qualified. We were informed that over a period of some eighteen months approximately 10,000cases were dealt with by Standing Court-Martial in Canada, amounting to at
least 90 per cent, of the cases that would have been tried by normally con-stituted courts-martial,. and that the average length of time between the dateof the apprehension of an accused and the date his punishment commencedwas approximately eight days.251. The General Officer Commanding or other Commander to whomapplication for trial by standing court was submitted, had an absolute dis-cretion to order the case to be fried instead by a normally constituted court-martial. Thus trial by Standing Court-Martial ran parallel with trial bynormal court-martial and was not necessarily a substitute for it.252. We understand the Canadian military authorities regard the experi-ment as a success. So far as we are aware, it has not been operated in theRoyal Canadian Air Force. .253. We have set out these details regarding the Canadian Schemefor convenience of reference only, and not because the Committee has reachedthe conclusion that a similar scheme would be equally successful in the Armyand in the Royal Air Force. For example, it would be impossible in peace-time to provide a sufficient number of qualified lawyers here, where a farlarger number of cases would arise for trial as compared with the numberstried during the war by Standing Court-Martial in Canada. In these cir-cumstances the Military Magistrate would have to be a serving officer of thekind described in paragraph 243 above who had been given a special courseof training in military law and procedure.254. Having given the matter careful consideration the Committee does not recommend the imposition of a system of Military Magistrates upon theArmy or the Royal Air Force. But the proposal is eminently one upon whicha final judgment can be pronounced only after it has been tried out. Wesuggest, therefore, that both Services should be given a permissive powerto institute such a scheme as an experiment in the first place. If this were done in peace-time and the experiment turned out to be a success, the scheme might have considerable value in the event of war, when it could be quicklyexpanded.CHAPTER  VIISUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSIONDelays before TrialParagraph.83.

ADDENDUM TO THE REPORTBy Mr. A, R. Blackburn, M.P.While subscribing to the Report as a whole, I regret that on one subject do not wholly agree with my colleagues on the Committee, namely on the composition of the Court in Courts-Martial.    I believe:  (a) That a private soldier, lance-corporal, or corporal (or lance-bombardier or bombardier) should have the right to demand thatone corporal (or bombardier) - should sit on a Court-Martial corn-posed of three persons trying him, or that two corporals (orbombardiers) should sit on a. Court-Martial composed - of fivepersons trying him.(6) That a.serjeant or warrant officer should have the right to demand that one serjeant or warrant officer, as the case may be, should sit on a Court-Martial composed of three persons trying. him, or that two Serjeants or warrant officers should sit on a Court-Martialcomposed of five persons trying him.(c) That the remaining members of the Court should be officers andshould be the only members of the Court determining sentence.-:&apos; &quot; ^&quot; -      CONCLUSION- &quot;We conclude this Report by saying that our task has been neither shortnor easy. But it would have taken longer and been much more difficultbut for the great help rendered to us by our Secretaries, Colonel W. R. F.Osmond, O.BE., Group Captain E. H. Hooper; C.B.E., and Lieutenant-Colonel R. J. H. de Brett. They brought to the aid of the Committee a fund of technical knowledge and experience which was invaluable; and theyresponded willingly and efficiently to all the calls we made upon them. Forthe assistance thus rendered the Committee desires to record its greatindebtedness, and to express its thanks.(Sgd.) WILFRID LEWIS (Chairman).,,    P. BABINGTON.&apos;RAYMOND BEACKBURN*.,,    BRIDGEMAN.,,    TERENCE DONOVAN.THEOBALD MATHEW.,,    JOHN MAUDE.,,    R. A. F. THORP.
Under this proposal the other ranks serving on a Court-Martial would always be at least of the rank of non-commissioned officer and would onlydecide whether the accused was or was not guilty. .In general, no person, whether in civilian life or in the services, shouldbe liable to conviction for any serious offence except through the lawfuljudgment of his peers. These words come down the ages from MagnaCarta, 1216, where it was agreed that no free man should be imprisoned &quot; nisiper legale judicium pariurh vel per legem terras &quot;. In civilian life a mancharged with a serious offence has in effect the right to demand trial by hispeers, because a jury is taken at random from all sections of the community to try him.In the services, one cannot introduce a similar provision to ensure thata jury is drawn at random from all members of the services, because to do so would conflict with discipline. The central problem in Courts-Martial is thereconciliation of discipline with justice. But I suggest that an attempt shouldbe made to assimilate Court-Martial procedure to civilian procedure in this important respect, if it can be done without affecting discipline.Most private soldiers are today so young that it would be wrong for themto serve on Courts-Martial. Moreover, there is no guarantee that a privatesoldier has a proper understanding of the requirements of discipline. Butcorporals (or bombardiers) are men who have received promotion becausethey have a sense of responsibility and discipline. If they can be trustedwith the lives of their sections in the exacting predicaments of battle, surelythey can be trusted to serve as members of a jury. The proposal which Ihave made would limit their functions to serving as jurymen, as they wouldnot be consulted on sentence.It has been suggested that many other ranks would strongly object tohaving other ranks sitting in judgment upon them. I have some doubtswhether this is so, but in any event the point is met by the requirement that other ranks will sit only if the accused so demands.The proposal which I have made should be considered in the light of theCommittee&apos;s recommendation that all verdicts should be unanimous. Itis an attempted compromise between a number of conflicting considera-tions. If it were tried out for a certain period it might well be found wrong in some respects, and consequent changes could be made. But in my view,in the interests of ensuring that the fundamental principles of British justice and freedom derived from Magna Carta shall extend even to Courts-Martial&apos;,some attempt should be made to give other ranks the right to ensure thatif they so wish they shall not be convicted unless by the verdict of at least one other rank as well as officers.(Sgd.)

APPENDIX c(Referred to in paragraph 112)Proposed New DepartmentsOutline of Establishment1. It is necessary first to establish the probable future volume of court-martial work.In the recently published White Paper on Defence (Cmd. 7327) the strengths of the Armyand the Royal Air Force are assessed as follows : 1st April, 1948       31^ March, 19492. The ratio of trials by court-martial to strength in the Army has varied between1 -1 per cent, in 1938 to 1 - 75 per cent, in 1944/5. In the Royal Air Force the corresponding figures are 0-2 per cent, and 0-4 per cent. The increases in the war-time years are nodoubt due in the main to the increase of desertion and absence without leave and to other offences which, because of the circumstances of active service, are more frequent in warthan in peace.3. The 1938 figures refer only to the regular army and the regular air force, and it must therefore be considered whether the introduction of compulsory service is likely to causean increase in the ratio of offences to strength. It is certain, on the one hand, that theresult of National Service will be to bring into the Forces, especially into the Army, a numberof young men with criminal records and tendencies. This may be especially so during theimmediate post-war period. Whether or not this will raise the ratio of trials by court-martial to strength permanently above the pre-war level remains to be seen, and in the calculations which follow we have made no allowance for this possibility.4. We have endeavoured to determine the likely minimum figure of courts-martial onwhich to base our estimate for the legal staff necessary to implement our recommendations as to organisation. In the light of the best evidence available to us, and after consultationwith the Judge Advocate General&apos;s Department, we are of opinion that the number of courts-martial in the Army and Royal Air Force is likely to be about 1 per cent, of overallstrength, that is to say, not less than 5,500 courts-martial each year, ranging from themost trivial to the most complicated.5. Of this number at least 10 per cent, are, we think, likely to be General Courts-Martial.We assume that there will be a negligible number only of Emergency Courts-Martial.6. On the basis of a total of 5,500 courts-martial a year, we estimate that approximately .550 will be General Courts-Martial with a Judge Martial as president, and 1,500 will beDistrict Courts-Martial with an Assistant Judge Martial as president.7. On these figures we have made an estimate of requirements in legal staff. In doing so we have assumed that the Judge Advocate General&apos;s present commitment in regard towar crimes has been liquidated. We have also assumed, after consultation with the judge advocate General, that separate legal staffs, both for the Chief Judge Martial&apos;s department and for the Directorates of Legal Services, will be maintained in three overseas commandsonly, namely, Rhine Army, Middle East and Far East, and that the requirements of othercommands will be met either from home or from one of the foregoing three overseascommands.8. The office of the Chief Judge Martial is likely to require the following, all of whomwill be civilians : 1 Chief Judge Martial.1 Vice-Chief Judge Martial.13 Judges Martial.13 Assistant Judges Martial.1 Legal Assistant (Establishment Officer).I Registrar (legally qualified) for the Court of Appeal and office.1 Assistant Registrar (legally qualified).Army       ...Royal Air Force ...534.000261,000345,000-226,000795,000571,000Total   31
9. In addition, subordinate staff will be required, not legally qualified, to include a chief Clerk for the Appeal and Court-Martial Registry, a Librarian and a proper numberof note takers.10. Of the legally qualified staff, the Chief Judge Martial, the Vice-Chief Judge Martial,the Legal Assistant, the Registrar and the Assistant Registrar will be required irrespective of the number of actual trials. The numbers of Judges Martial and Assistant JudgesMartial can be adjusted according to the actual volume of work.11. This establishment would provide for the following staff in each of the three main -overseas commands referred to above : i Judge Martial (appointed Deputy Chief Judge Martial for the command abroad)i Judge Martial (for use on trial work and to relieve the Deputy Chief Judge Martial).2   Assistant Judges Martial.12. These figures have been calculated in order to allow for leave, sickness and thenormal incidence of posting. It has also been assumed that if the volume of work provestemporarily too large for this irreducible minimum of staff to handle, then it would bepossible to make use of lawyers appointed ad hoc, say, to the Courts-Martial Appeal Courtin London, or as presidents of courts-martial at home or in Germany, and that reinforce-ments could be similarly obtained in certain stations abroad from local lawyers. We wish,however, to make it clear that unless the number of permanent staff, albeit kept to aminimum, allows for postings, leave and sickness, the service will not be attractive to suitable candidates and the new scheme would inevitably then make a bad start.13. Similarly, the minimum staff required for the Directorates of Legal Services in theArmy and the Royal Air Force would be as follows : Directorate of Army .Legal Services- (and Legal Instruction)War Office(Regular Officers)I	Brigadier in charge-	-Director of Army Legal Services (D.A.L.S.).2	Colonels	1 D.D.A.L.S. and Second-in-Command.		1 D.D.A.L.S. (instruction).6	Lieut.-Colonels	3 abroad.		3 at home (1 instruction).9	Majors         ....	3 abroad.		6 at home (1 instruction).12	Captains	3 abroad.		g at home.I	Captain	Administrative officer (not legally qualifed).Total 31		Directorate of Air Force Legal Services(and Legal Instruction)Air Ministry(Regular Officers)Air Commodore in charge Director of  Air Force Legal Services(D.A.F.L.S.).Prosecution and instruction (D.D.A.F.L.S.).3 abroad.2 at home (1 instruction).3 abroad.3 at home (1 instruction).3 abroad.3 at home.Administrative Officer (not legally qualified).1 Group Captain5 Wing Commanders .6 Squadron Leaders .6 Flight Lieutenants .1 Flight Lieutenant  .Total 20In these cases also allowance has been made for the Directorates to be represented in three major commands abroad. &apos;
14. Both the Chief Judge Martial&apos;s Department and the said Directorates will benumerically small and care must be taken to attract the right type of candidate by goodsalaries and, what is even more important, by reasonable prospects of promotion. It maybe necessary, particularly if the service is formed by taking in the majority of the entrantsat the same date, to provide for time promotion up to the rank of lieutenant-colonel; with similar financial prospects for the civilian staff of the Chief Judge MartiaVs Department.15. To provide for expansion of the said Directorates in war time, and also to facilita+ethe temporary,use of lawyers in addition to the establishments, we think it desirable thata reserve of officers should be established for these two Directorates, composed initiallyof lawyers who during the late war have been engaged on Service legal work, and who areprepared to join such a reserve. A panel of lawyers available for temporary work withthe Chief Judge Martial&apos;s Department could well be organised on similar lines.16. If full use is to be made of the expert knowledge of the officers of these departments,,particularly of prosecuting branches, they must have transport allocated to them so that,for example, delay in taking summaries of evidence does not arise through difficulty intaking the officer to the spot.(B48/111)  400 5/48  W.O.P.  29542
