(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OB1 HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET COPY NO.   rK 1CP. (k8)  306   :.20th December,  19U8.CABINETPOLICY TOWARDS germany memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in dealing with the various German problems as they arise it is necessary in each case to recall what is the basisof our present day policy towards Germany.      Apart from thelong-term occupation and continued demilitarisation of Germany,this policy has to take account of the following fourobjectives:-(i)    to secure the association of Germany with the Westrather than the East and to incorporate Germanyinto the comity of Western nations;(ii)    to pay due regard to the sentiments of the Germanpeople, but without creating the fatal impression that we are bidding against the Russians and goingto Germany hat in hand:(iii)    to carry the French Government with us;    to takeFrench fears and susceptibilities as regardssecurity into account,  particularly as regards thecontinued military and economic disarmament of .Germany;    to sustain the Third Force in France;and to avoid policies which are calculated to reinforce the position of General de Gaulle, bringhim back to power and so destroy the whole structure of Western Union:(iv)    to carry the United States Government with us in theexecution of the above  policies;    to induce themto maintain a continuing interest in preventingGermany from becoming once again a menace to world peace and in the establishment in Germany of a healthy political and economic system;    and to persuade them to adopt a consistent policy on theabove lines and to avoid policies in Germany whichare  likely to be unpopular with either the ThirdForce parties in Western European countries or withthe German people as a whole.2. Conflicting interests are thus continuously at work,and skill and care will be required to steer a safe coursebetween them.3. The following are short paragraphs on the moreimportant questions at present under consideration with astatement of the present position on each:-
k*        BASIC LAW (provisional Constitution)For the past few months the Germans in theParliamentary Council at Bonn have &quot;been engaged in working out a provisional constitution for Western Germany, called the &quot;Basic Law&quot;.      On the whole they have worked hard and well,  although there has been a certain amount of delay dueto disagreements between the two major parties,  the ChristianDemocrats and the Social Democrats,  and decisions have had tobe reached not by compromise but by a majority vote.      Thedraft constitution is now nearing completion and...will in due course have to be dovetailed into the Occupation Statute(see paragraph 5 below).      There are likely to be some points in it,   particularly as regards division of power between theCentre and the Laender, where there will be difficulty in reaching agreement among the Occupying Powers.      It is hopedthat elections will be held under the new law in the earlySpring,  and a Western German Government established in Aprilor May.5*        OCCUPATION statute for their part the three Military Governors havebeen drafting an Occupation Statute which  vill define the relationship between the Occupying Powers on the one handand German authorities on the other.      The Military Governorshave now had their final meeting on this Statute and haveseparated out the comparatively few points of difference tobe referred to Governments.      Unresolved points will have tobe settled by inter-Governmental discussion,  and the final draft,  after approval by Governments, will be promulgated, atthe same time as the Military Governors announce their approvalof the provisional constitution.      Some of the unresolvedpoints should be fairly easy to settle at the inter-Governmentaldiscussion but the Question of the incidence of occupation costs.upon the Federal Government or upon the LaenderGovernments, where we and the Americans are in favour of theformer for practical reasons and the French in favour of thelatter for purely political reasons, may prove difficult to resolve.6 *        IMMUNIT IBS REGULATIONA British draft has been prepared in Germany of regulation defining in some detail the immunities to beenjoyed in Western Germany by staffs of the OccupyingAuthorities.      The United States and French have objected toit on the grounds that .it attempts to be too precise andinvolves a risk that every case of immunity which is not expressly included will be automatically excluded.      Theywould, - therefore,   prefer a  short document in broad phraseology,conferring complete immunity on the occupation forces andcontrol commissions.7. This point is still being examined, but it is likely that we can give way to the French and Americans,  since theGermans were accustomed in the past  to the idea of thevirtually complete immunity of their own Army.8 *        PHY SIC AL DEMILITARISATIONThis covers fortifications,  air fields, gunemplacements,  air raid shelters,  etc.,  etc.,  undergroundfactories,  and the buildings in military establishments andCategory I and II War Plants.      Controversy centres upon
buildings.      Our policy is to have as many &quot;buildings aspossible made unobjectionable from a security point of view,so that they may be retained, for peaceful purposes,  and to destroy the remainder as quickly as possible.      In ouropinion this is humane and liberal;    and it can be reconciledwith the letter of our quadripartite obligations.Demilitarisation is the responsibility of each Zone commander in his own Zone.      Our interpretation of the quadripartiteDirectives is unlikely to arouse the interest of the americans and the French;    nor is the policy itself likely to meet withany criticism from them.9.        LEVEL OF INDUSTRY,  PROHIBITED AND RESTRICTED INDUSTRIES,RECENT MEMORANDUM TO THE UNITI1D STATES GOVERNMENTOur policy here .is to take and maintain consistently,such measures as will prevent the re-creation of dangerous war potential in German industry, to do no more than this,  andto leave Germany&apos; both the means and the freedom to supportherself and to maico her contribution to European recovery.In the immediate future our objectives will be:-to reach tripartite agreement upon the following questions:-(i) Which of the industries prohibited under thequadripartite Plan of March,  19h7, shouldcontinue to be prohibited?(ii) What capacity should be left in those industries prohibited under the quadripartitePlan of March,  19u7,  that are to be prohibitedno longer?(iii) Which industries (other than those that areto remain prohibited)  should be subject to continuing limitations upon capacity and production?to ensure the removal from Germany of surplus capacityfrom the industries concerned.      Unless this is done the prohibitions and limitations are likely in thelong run to prove unenforceable.Mr. Hoffman&apos;s  activities in the field of reparationshaving had the effect of halting negotiations on the prohibitedindustries and of bringing our whole policy into jeopardy,we recently addressed a memorandum to the United StatesGovernment, in concert with the French Government, invitingthem to restate their general attitude to these questions.The result has been encouraging.      On 11th December Mr.  Douglasinformed us that the United States Government desired an early agreement on the treatment of the industries prohibited by thePlan of March,  19u7,  and agreed that the surplus capacityshould be removed as reparations and that these removals shouldnot be subject to review by the Economic Go-operotionAdministration.      Mr.  Douglas also said that the United StatesGovernment accepted the agreed limit of 10.7 million tons ayear on steel production, to be maintained until the peace treaty unless that should be greatly delayed.      We hope that itwill now be possible to make progress.(a)0010.
11.        REPARATIONSThe reparations list published in October,  191+7,dealt only with the industries which have been restricted(not prohibited) by the Plan of March,  19u7.      Early thisyear the United States Government suggested that some of theplants on this list would better serve the purpose of european recovery if left in Germany than if removed toother countries.We agreed in principle to consider taking a few plants off the list.      After months of confusion and vacillation, Mr. Hoffmanappointed the &quot;Humphrey Committee&quot; to advise him, in this matter.This Committee has visited the three Western Zones,  and beforepreparing its report to Mr. Hoffman came to London to hear theviews of British and French officials.      Protracted meetingshove taken place,  during which the Committee&apos;s tentativerecommendations have been fully discussed and somewhat modified.The Committee has nov/ to report to Mr.  Hoffman.      We now awaitfrom the United States State Department a formal request forthe United States Government to delete certain plants from the reparations list.12. A supplementary list of plants from the industriesprohibited by the Plan of March,  19u7,  has yet to be drawnup.      This will not be subject to review by Mr. floffman.13.        TRUSTEESHIP LAWThe Trusteeship Law for the cool, iron and steel industries in the Bizonal area is now in force and steps arebeing taken to apply it.      The French have mode a formal statement to us and to the Americans,  with reference to thestatement in the preamble about the determination of ownershipby the Germans themselves,  that they will not recognise any decision on this- subject taken by a German Government whichhas not previously been agreed between the three occupying powers.      This may be awkward when the German Government comes to take its decision,  but no action is required at present.We do not propose to retreat from the position taken up in thelow.1J+. INTERIM AT IONAL RUHR AUTHORITYDiscussions on the draft Statute for the international control of the Ruhr are still proceeding and very good progress has been made in the last few days.      We and the americans have been able to go some way to meet the French in theiranxieties about international control of management.      On the text of the agreement itself,  the main outstanding difficulty-is the question of German representation and the German vote.Apart from this, the only major point on which difficultiesneed now be expected is the question of public ownership inrelation to the Authority&apos;s contingent powers to preventexcessive concentrations of economic power.      A&apos;draft agreement and a proposed press communique are being submitted to the Cabinet on 22nd December.     It is proposedto set up the Authority some time before the formationof a Western German Government,15.        MILITARY SECURITY BGA,RDThe Military Governors have made good progress towardsreaching agreement on a directive containing the terms ofreference for the setting up of a three-Power Military SecurityBoard as contemplated in the report on the London Talks.      The
functions of this Board will &quot;be to prevent, a revival of German &apos;armed power and militarism and to ensure the necessary controlsfor this in the military,  economic and scientific spheres.This directive has boon referred to Governments.      In thecourse of the discussions on the Ruhr,  the american representatives have declared that the United States Governmentfavours the idea of entrusting the Military Security Boardand its successor in the post-Control Period with the implementation of a suitably modified version of the proposalsfor the enforcement of disarmament and demilitarisation containedin the so-called &quot;Byrnes Treaty&quot;,      They have made it clear,however,  that the United States Government does not wish to delay the setting up of the Board whilst this suggestion isconsidered, but that, on the contrary,  it wishes .to see theBoard constituted at the earliest possible moment.      This is inaccordance with our own views and those of the French, whoattach the highest importance to this body,16*        TRIZONAL FUSIONThe Americans share our view that it would be premature to try to replace the present Bizonal Fusion agreement,  when itexpires on 31st December, by a Trizonal Agreement.      Accordinglynegotiations for the renewal and amendment of the BizonalAgreement ore now proceeding in Washington,  and the resultingagreement will contain a provision that it is extended until30th June next or until Trizonal fusion takes place.      It isintended that negotiations for the Trizonal Fusion Agreement should start as soon as practicable after the completion of theOccupation Statute,   and that Trizonal Fusion should take placesimultaneously with the formation of a German Government.These proposals have not yet been  put formally to the French,but there is little doubt that they are aware of what is proposed and that they will regard it as reasonable.      Meanwhile it isonly in the sphere of trade that affairs are conducted on atrizonal basis,  and the French are now represented with ourselves and the- Americans on the Joint Export-Import Agency.17.        TRIPARTITE control the London talks lust spring and the approach oftrizonal fusion have led to a demand by the Americans and theFrench that there should be a system of tripartite controlthroughout the three zones both at the Federal and Land levelsas soon as a West German Government has been established.At the Federal level an agreed procedure for this has been worked out by the Military Governors, but at the Land levelthere is at present no agreement among them.      We are in nohurry to change the present system, which suits us very well,but eventually there may have to be an  agreed procedureproviding for some tripartite control at Land level which willnot be so extensive as to affect the efficient operation ofthe Laender Governments under the general supervision of therespective Commanders-in-Chi ef.18.        BIZONAL LONG-TERM PROGRAMMEWe are preparing a letter to the United states ambassador and instructions to Sir E. Hall-Patch, designed toput it on record both with the United States Government andwith the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation,  thatwe do not regard ourselves as committed to the Bizonal Long-Term
Programme in its present form,- and that we are not at presentprepared to support it as it stands.      Having made these communications, we shall no doubt be involved in furtherinterdepartmental discussions and in consultations with theBritish authorities in Germany as to the sort of amendments which could reasonably be made in the Programme.E. B.Foreign Office,  S.W.1.20th December,  &quot;i91+8.
