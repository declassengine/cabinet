jjflS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  December 1948SECRET Copy No.3 1CP. (48) 2989th December, 1948CABINETTHE  SYSTEM OF  GOVERNMENT  AND  INTERNAL  CONDITIONSIN PORTUGALMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in accordance with the decision taken by the Cabinet on 4th November(CM. (48) 68th Conclusions, Minute 3), I circulate for the information of mycolleagues the following account of the system of government and internal conditions in Portugal.Conditions leading to the present regime.2. From the 14th to 16th centuries Portugal was one of the Great powers in the world. In 1580, however, she fell under Spanish domination, which lastedfor sixty years and from the effects of which she has never fully recovered.During the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th her regime was a constitutional monarchy modelled on the English pattern. It must be admitted that this was not a success, and the monarchy came to an inglorious end withthe Republican revolution of 1910. The cure, however, was worse than the disease,and during the fifteen years between August 1911, when the Republican Con-stitution was promulgated, and May 1926, when an end was put to it by a militarycoup d&apos; tat, there were eight Presidents, forty-four Governments and more than twenty risings. Chaos reigned in the administration, corruption was rife andthe country was bankrupt. This comparatively primitive Latin people had shown themselves unable to assimilate a strong dose of modern liberal democracy, andthe parliamentary system, which had been abused, was universally discredited.The military coup d&apos;Etat of 1926 was carried out by a triumvirate, of which general, now Marshal, Carmona was the leading figure. The triumvirate soondisintegrated and General Carmona took over sole power, legislating by decree.Later in 1926 he assumed the functions of President, a position he still occupies,his status and position having been confirmed by a national plebiscite in 1928.3. At this date PortugaFs economic affairs were still chaotic, and dr. Salazar, a professor from Coimbra University, was called in to straightenthem out. In 1928 - he became Finance Minister with very wide powers for financial control and in 1932 was appointed Prime Minister : he still holdsthe latter office, and has since then exercised supreme control. General Carmonanow only fulfils the representational and constitutional functions of a president,although his personal popularity has contributed much towards the stability ofthe regime.The Estado Novo4. The Estado Novo, or New State, in Portugal makes no pretence of beingdemocratic in our sense of the word. On the other hand, Dr. Salazar has alwaysdisclaimed any connexion with &quot; Fascist &quot; ideas. Unlike Franco, he has not supported or associated himself with the Nazi or Fascist regimes. His aim hasbeen to embody, in what he considers a form suitable to the present stage of portuguese development, the general principles laid down in the Papal Encyclicalson social questions.36267
5. Under the Constitution of 1933^ which was ratified by a plebiscite in1934, the President is elected by popular vote for seven years at a time (thenext presidential elections are due early in 1949). He appoints and may dismissthe Prime Minister, who in his turn appoints the Ministers. There is a: national assembly, with deliberative and legislative functions, but it is expressly laiddown in&apos;the Constitution that the continuation of the Government in power isnot affected by an adverse vote in the Assembly. Even were this body notcomposed, as it is at present, exclusively of supporters of the regime, it could therefore exercise no effective control over policy. Alongside it is a smaller body,called the Corporative Chamber, representing professional organisations, whichreports on all legislative proposals brought before the National Assembly.6. The franchise is granted to all literate adults and to all illiterate maleadults and female heads of families who pay taxes of not less than 100 escudos(about  1) a year. But certain persons, including &quot;those who profess ideascontrary to the existence of Portugal as an independent State and to social disci-pline &apos;&apos; may be debarred from voting. The 120 members of the National Assemblyare elected on a &quot; block list &apos;&apos; system, by which any 200 electors may present a block list covering the whole country; each elector votes for the list of his choiceas a whole, but has the right to delete the names of any candidates to whom heobjects, and the members of the list which receives the largest number of votes in practice, of course, the Government list are elected, except that no candidatemay be elected if he receives less than one-tenth of the total number of votes cast.7. The Magistrature is declared by the Constitution independent andirremovable, and the Constitution guarantees certain fundamental rights to allcitizens, including the right to personal inviolability, freedom of religious beliefand practice, free expression of thought, inviolability of domicile and secrecy of correspondence, immunity from arrest without charge and freedom of meeting and association. These guarantees are, however, qualified by other provisions whichenable the Government to suppress activities which it considers subversive. Thusfreedom of expression is controlled by special laws designed to prevent &quot; theperversion of public opinion in its function as a social force &quot; (newspapers and periodicals are subjected to censorship before publication). Persons taken inflagrante delicto in the commission of crimes, or attempted crimes, against theState may be arrested without formal charge. The regime maintains an efficientsecret police, with political prisons and a concentration camp in the Cape VerdeIslands. Such opposition organisations as exist are denied means of expression.Behind the facade of the corporative system the workers have no more than a nominal part in the settlement of labour and wage conditions.8. Dr. Salazar is in fact an autocrat, and he allows the Portuguese libertiesonly to the extent to which he thinks that these will not be abused. He may, ofcourse, be wrong in his estimate of the unreadiness of his compatriots for agreater degree of responsibility, but it cannot be denied that he is a man of highmoral principles, very hard-working, free from any suspicion of corruption andentirely devoted to his country&apos;s best interests as he conceives them. He does not allow himself to be dominated by any sectional interest, and his passion for economy has more than once led to serious trouble with the Army. Materially, hehas done a great deal, within the limits imposed by his refusal to borrow abroad.The budget was balanced in 1928 and has remained balanced ever since. He hasfought the two greatest curses of the country, poverty and illiteracy, by buildingschools and promoting public works; in particular, he has completed an excellentnetwork of roads and begun a most ambitious electrification scheme, which aimsat providing the whole country for the first time with a cheap source of powerand which it is hoped will make possible a greater degree of industrialisation than has been possible hitherto.9. Nor are the State&apos;s very considerable powers of repression exercised in abrutal way. There is, indeed, no need for this, since, as has already been men-tioned, the parliamentary regime had broken down completely when GeneralCarmona seized power, and, though there is grumbling and criticism among themore educated sections of the population, the regime has on the whole proved itselfacceptable in what is still a very backward country. In any case fanaticism andbrutality are not, as unfortunately they are in Spain, national characteristics, andthe reality of autocratic rule is tempered by frequent touches of kindliness andhumour. Recently, for instance, a number of high-ranking officers who hadconspired to overthrow the Government were confined, in the greatest comfort, in
3164the private wing of a lunatic asylum, and a political prisoner was allowed toattend a reception at His Majesty&apos;s Embassy to receive a British decoration,on condition that he was accompanied by a plain-clothes policeman and returnedafter the ceremony to captivity. These were special cases, but political prisonersare not usually maltreated, and there is not that sense of constraint and oppressionwhich characterised Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, and which descends like ablack cloud on the traveller when he crosses the frontier into Spain.Portugal&apos;s External Relations10. Portugal is our oldest Ally and, through all the centuries since the firstTreaty between the two countries was signed in 1373, the Alliance has been thesheet-anchor of her foreign policy, though as Spain&apos;s weaker neighbour she hasalways tried to maintain the best possible relations with that country. In the1914-18 war she was a belligerent and sent a force to France. In the last warshe remained neutral, but, when asked to do so in 1943, she furnished us withfacilities, which were extended to the Americans also, for naval units and aircraft to make use of the Azores. She therefore contributed greatly to the success ofthe anti-submarine campaign and to the ease of air communications across the atlantic. These facilities have.since been renewed in a modified form for an indefinite period by agreement between the Portuguese and United States Govern-ments, and we have been given the right to avail ourselves of them if we wish.Jealous as she is of her sovereignty, Portugal is therefore already providingassistance for the maintenance of the American occupation forces in Germany,and by her geographical position at least, if not by her armed forces, she is clearly in a position to contribute to any security system in the North Atlantic.E.
