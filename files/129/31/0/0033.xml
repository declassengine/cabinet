THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY J)F HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT        JPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1948SECEET Copy No3 iCP.. (48) 30320th December, 1948CABINETREPARATIONS AND THE EUROPEAN RECOVERY programme memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs have been reconsidering, in the light of proposals which the Economic Co-operation Administrators reparations committee have under examination, theplants which might better serve the purpose of European recovery if left in Ger-many than if removed and re-erected elsewhere. Subject to the re-examination ofcertain questions, the Committee may propose the retention of 167 out of the 381plants under review. It is clear that in -many respects the American proposalsbear little relationship to the work of the Organisation for European economic co-operation. Further, by its terms of reference the Committee has excluded from consideration the security and political factors to which great, if not equal, im-portance must be attached. The retention in Germany of 167 plants would materially increase the war potential of a united Germany or a Power occupyingWestern Germany. The additional risk to security which acceptance of this would represent might have serious repercussions in France. After carefully consideringthe proposals of the American Committee and the economic, political and securityfactors involved, and after giving full weight to French views, I consider that wemust go some way to meet the United States proposals in order to reach an early settlement on the whole reparations question, provided that we can obtain an agree-ment satisfactory to ourselves of the related problems of the prohibition and limita-tion of certain German industries and the establishment of a Ruhr Authority.Certain proposals to this end, involving the retention in Germany of 117 plants,have been worked out interdepartmentally at the official level and are attached here to.2.   I accordingly ask my colleagues to agree that I should be authorised : (i) To propose to the United States Government that only the 117 plants listedat Annex B, Section I, to this memorandum be deleted from the British,French and American reparations lists and retained in Germany; thefifty plants listed at Annex B, Section II, being removed as reparationsfrom Germany.(ii) To agree at my discretion to the.retention in Germany of certain furtherplants if this becomes necessary to obtain agreement and provided itforms part of a solution satisfactory to ourselves in regard to theprohibition and limitation of certain German industries and theestablishment of a Ruhr Authority.3. On loth October and 18th November the Cabinet considered memoranda on reparations and the European Recovery Programme (CP. (48) 234 and CP. (48)259) and approved an agreement with the United States authorities concerninga review of the reparations programmes (required by Section 115F of the UnitedStates Foreign Assistance Act*), and a list of thirty-five plants in the British Zone.* Section 115f of the United States Foreign Assistance Act reads as follows:  &quot; The Administrator will request the United States Secretary of State to obtain the agree-ment of those countries concerned that such capital equipment as is scheduled for removalas reparations from the three Western Zones: of Germany should be retained in Germanyif such retention will most effectively serve the purposes of the European recovery programme.&quot;237
the dismantling of which might be suspended whenever such action might appearappropriate. The Committee set up by the Economic Co-operation Administratorunder Mr. Humphrey has completed its investigations and has spent some claysin London discussing the report due to be presented to the United States Secretaryof State in early January. British and French representatives have attendedmeetings.of the Committee and have been given an opportunity of commenting onthe Humphrey Committee proposals. As a result of these conversations theCommittee has reduced its demands for plants to be retained in Germany from231 to 167.4. An appreciation of the political, economic and security considerations involved in this question is given, at Annex A.5. The United States Ambassador and the Economic Co-operation Admin-istrator have said that once the report is presented to Mr. Hoffman it will haveto be published and the United States Government itself will have little discretion to alter its recommendations, although my advice from Washington is that theposition may not be quite as rigid as this. In view of the desirability of seeking to influence the Committee&apos;s report in the formative stage the British representa-tives, after full interdepartmental consideration, have therefore notified theAmerican Committee of a list of fifty plants and/or part plants which in their view should be retained on the reparations list; they have thus indicated by implication the plants which British officials were prepared to recommend to ministers should be left in Germany. This list was fully agreed with the french delegation who have adopted a similar procedure but wish for the removal as reparations of a somewhat larger number of plants. It was made clear by boththe British and.French representatives that these informal expressions of viewwere without prejudice to any Ministerial decisions and to the right to considerthe whole matter from the wider security standpoint in the light of agreementsreached regarding the International Ruhr Authority, and the prohibition and limitation of certain German industries as a result of negotiations now inprogress.6. An analysis of the Humphrey Committee proposals and of the Britishand French counter proposals which have been put forward on the official level is.given below :-Since numbers of plants are misleading, a table giving details of the plants con-cerned is attached at Annex C.7.   The British amendments to the Humphrey proposals are based on theprinciple that the following types of plant should remain on the reparations. list :-(a) plants already dismantled to the extent of 40 per cent, or more;(6) plants unnecessary to meet the Humphrey Committee&apos;s production targetseven on the favourable assumptions made by that Committee;(c) plants possessing in themselves some special war potential other than inthe surplus industrial capacity that they represent;(d) plants  the retention of which would be contrary to our proposals regarding the prohibited and limited industries as approved in cp. (48)203;(e) certain plants the retention of which in Germany would be unacceptable to the French; or(/) plants which represent a priority requirement to the United Kingdom.France, or our Allies at I.A.R.A.8. The most important concessions to the American point of view which theofficial recommendations involve is an increase of 413,000 tons in capacity forthe manufacture of raw steel and the retention of considerable tube-making capacity.  This, however, will not be reflected in an increase in the level of actualProposals for the Retention of Plant in GermanyHumphrey BritishCommittee OfficialProposals ProposalsChemicals       ...       ......        34 23Non-ferrous metals    ...       ...         7 3Mechanical Engineering      ...        88 73Steel     ............        38 20FrenchOfficialProposals2136415
3238production of raw steel, which the United States Government has agreed to main-tain foi the present at its existing authorised limit of 11 1 million ingot tonsin Western Germany, corresponding to 10-7 million ingot tons for the fiizone.The tube-making plant has^ undoubtedly important war potential, but oil tubesare a product of which there will be a continuing world shortage. The recom-mendations also involve a substantial increase in other facilities for finishingsteel which cannot be estimated in terms of capacity. The economic advantages of this lie in the greater variety of product which Germany might be enabled to make for the export market and a certain concentration of manufacturing-processes which might help her to reduce production costs. The main war potential in the steel group which the United States Committee propose forretention is possessed by the Deutsche Edelstahlwerke at Kref eld ^ and theTiegelstahlwerke at Bochum. The removal of these plants as reparations is ofoverriding importance from the security point of view.9. Apart from steel, the official recommendations provide for the retentionof plant&apos; in two industries-mechanical engineering and chemicals which wewere prepared to allow the Germans to develop without limitation on capacity(CP. (48) 203),, though no - immediate increase was contemplated when that memorandum was approved. Though the number of plants recommended forretention in the mechanical engineering industry is large seventy-three out ofeighty-eight recommended by the United States Committee the number of machine tools represented by these plants is less than 15,000. It is true that theGerman machine tool population is probably greater than German industryrequires and the surplus can be regarded as war potential. But the plants recom-mended for retention do not possess any special war potential in themselvesTheir retention would meet the American view that Germany should be allowedto retain a larger number and a greater variety of plants to enable her to com-pete in the export trade. The number of plants in the chemical group proposed for retention is also relatively large twenty-three out of thirty-four recommendedby the United State Committee. The chemical industry in Western Germanyto-day possesses a capacity in excess of that in 1936, and the retention of anycapacity at present listed for removal can be represented as an increase in war potential. But this is an industry in which Germany possesses both the meansand ability to compete on equal terms in the export market and the Americansattach considerable importance to her being allowed to do so. The retention inGermany of twenty-three plants would appear to assist in this direction but would do so at a relatively small security price.10. The non-ferrous metals industry is one the limitation of which we have proposed in the course of negotiations on the prohibition and limitation of certainGerman industries. Of the seven plants from this industry recommended for retention-tion by the American Committee officials propose the retention of three whichpossess no special war potential. Some importance is, however, attached to theremoval of the other four in order to maintain an effective limitation of this industry.11. The French have proposed the removal as reparations of a slightlylarger number of plants than ourselves. They wish to do this because they are unwilling to give away the position which they have hitherto maintained that theyobject, on security grounds, to any expansion of the German steel industry orincrease in German machine-tool holdings. They have indicated, however, that at alater stage in the negotiations they will be prepared to make substantial concessions in these respects. Our reason for not supporting the French position is that wefear that by increasing unduly the number of plants in dispute with the Americanswe shall endanger the chances of removing from Germany those plantswhich possess a real war potential...........- - E.

ANNEX AAppreciation of Political, Economic and Security considerartions the factors relevant to the Humphrey Committee proposals are economic,political and military. Unfortunately, the terms of reference of the HumphreyCommittee have permitted them to consider the economic factors alone (though they are now showing a certain willingness to take other considerations intoaccount). Even on the economic,plane the Committee has not been able seriouslyto estimate the balance of European advantage in conducting their review. in reaching their present conclusions they have by their own admission not takeninto account many of the economic factors which appear to be most relevant; theyhave assumed full availability of materials, power, man-power and transport atthe end of the E R.P. period; and they have viewed plants in isolation rather than as units in a German or Western European economy. Nor have they taken intoaccount the extent to which nations have relied on reparations in formulatingtheir programmes for O.E.E.C.2. The political factors involved are our relations with the I.A.R.A. Powers;with the Soviet bloc; with the Germans; and, in particular, with France. TheI.A.R.A. Powers regard themselves as entitled to a larger measure of reparationthan is represented by the existing reparations programmes. A substantial cutmuch larger than they have been lead to expect in the programmes will thereforebe very unwelcome to them. But after the repeated disappointment of their hopeswhich they have suffered they are likely to accept, though with reluctance, any final settlement of the issue even if on a substantially reduced scale. So far as we ourselves are concerned there is little in this list in which we have a vital interestthough the shortening of the reparations list will make it much more difficult forus to obtain our requirements in other plants not affected by the HumphreyCommittee review. If it were to be decided to allocate to I.A.R.A. part of all ofthe share of reparations which has been set aside for the U.S.S.R. it would make our decision more palatabe to the members of the Agency.3. The Soviet bloc will regard a cut in the reparations programmes andtherefore a reduction in their potential share of capital reparations as furtherprovocation by the Western Powers and will no doubt seek to represent it as partof an Anglo-American plan to rebuild German war potential for use against theU.S.S.R. The Soviet have already taken from Germany more reparations thanthey are entitled to; moreover, the energetic prosecution of our other demilitarisation-tion programmes would effectively counter their propaganda. We can thereforecontemplate a Soviet protest with equanimity.4. The Germans accepted our reparations programme in October 1947 withsomething approaching relief at its moderate character. But they have been quickto make use of the differences between the Allies which have since been disclosed,and have for some time been conducting a campaign of misrepresentation againstwhat they choose to call &quot; dismantling.&quot; Acceptance of a cut in reparations at what the Germans will regard as American pressure may harm in some measureour prestige as an occupying Power. But a continuance of the present impasseuntil after the formation of a Western German Government might have even more serious consequences.5. France attaches great importance to the achievement of security against german aggression. Her Government, whose stability we must foster in theinterests of Western Union as well as of European recovery, is more dependentthan that of any other nation on success in attaining this aim. If acceptance infull of the Humphrey Committee&apos;s proposals were forced upon France it mighthave serious repercussions not only in France but in Western Europe and theUnited States Government has shown signs, in recent days, of recognising this.6. There are twin security objectives; in the long term to prevent a resurgenceof the military might of a united Germany; and in the short term to remove thedanger that Western Germany might materially supplement the war potential ofan invading Power hostile to ourselves. The removal of its war potential from german industry has hitherto been regarded as an essential element in the achieve-ment, of these aims. The purpose of the Anglo-American Level of Industry Plan,upon which the British and American reparations programmes are based, was the achievement of a measure of security by the removal&quot; from certain industries of
that industrial capacity which was built up by the Nazis after 1936 for war purposes. Acceptance of the American proposals even in part will reduce thesecurity value of the plan, though it js. difficult to express this in quantitativetprms. But the plan itself, was incomplete and did not deal with the industriesprohibited under the quadripartite level of industry plan of March .1946.Negotiations with regard to the future of these are at present being conducted on the basis of CP. (48) 203. The position adopted by the American negotiatorshas been incompatible with security; but we have been given, in the course of the reparations talks, an indication of a greater American willingness to meet our point of view. The establishment of the Ruhr Authority now being negotiatedin London also has security implications. Acceptance by the Americans of themain security requirements of ourselves and the French in these two negotiations would more than offset any dangers to security, resulting from a modification ofthe reparations programme on the scale proposed.
