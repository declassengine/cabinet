secret,y: v:.,;:;:::; bi;f:L 0:&apos;!3      coPy n0. 31CP. (48) 27518*A November, 1948CABINETHOUSING bill memorandum by the Minister of health in the working out of the Housing Bill, the inclusion of which in theLegislative Programme for the current session was approved by the Cabinet on18th October, 1948 (CM. (48) 64th Conclusions, Minute 1), one important pointof policy remains outstanding the question whether grants for the improvementof houses should, under any circumstances, be available for tied cottages. ACabinet decision is required on this point before the Bill can be submitted tothe Legislation Committee.2. Under the term &apos;&apos; tied cottages &apos;&apos; I include for this purpose two separatetypes :-(i) A cottage which is let on contract of service, occupation being contingent on the performance of services,(ii) A cottage which is let on a tenancy agreement but where possessioncan be obtained without proof of alternative accommodation under paragraph (g) of the First Schedule to the Rent Restriction Act, 1933,the most common instance being the procedure for recovering possessionof a cottage on a certificate from the County Agricultural ExecutiveCommittee that the person for whom the cottage is required is necessaryfor the appropriate working of the holding.3. The conclusion I have reached is that it would be wrong for us to include in a Housing Bill any provision which would enable grants to be made from theExchequer for the improvement of a house from which the tenant could be evictedunder either of the above conditions.4. I propose, therefore, in the Bill for England and Wales to provide that two of the statutory conditions for grant should be (i) That the dwelling shall not be occupied except by an owner or tenant,(ii) That the owner shall not at any time institute proceedings for ejectmenton the ground specified in paragraph (g) of the First Schedule tothe Act of 1933.5. The Secretary of State for Scotland, while accepting my views against any general inclusion of tied agricultural houses, considers that because of thelarge number of cottages attached to isolated farms in Scotland it would benecessary for him to have in the Scottish Bill power to admit to grant cottagesattached to farms if there is no alternative accommodation near at hand and the farm is so situated that the local authority see no prospect of themselves under-taking to provide houses in the locality. The Secretary of State proposes thatthis power should operate till July, 1953, when the grants now payable underthe Housing (Scotland) Acts for the replacement of tied cottages by new houses are to be reviewed.6. The Minister of Agriculture considers that, in view of the importanceof the improvement of housing to the Government&apos;s food production policy, grantsought to be made available in respect of farm houses, houses let by farmers to36161THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS BR1TAMHIC  MAJESTVS GOVERHMEHT        X; \A ;^    :     Printed for the Cabinet.

farm workers on tenancies, and to service cottages where the local authority couldnot reasonably be expected to. provide alternative accommodation. He does not regard it as appropriate to make this provision under agricultural legislation and considers that provision ought to be included in the Housing Bill.7. In the circumstances and in view of the time-table of the Bill, theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture, whom I have consulted, agree with me on the importance of an early decision. The matter is accordingly submitted to the Cabinet for decision.A. B.Ministry of Health, Whitehall, S.W. 1,18th November, 1948.
