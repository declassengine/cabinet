V18pHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)O       SECRETG.P.(48)  274 COPY NO._ 22ND NOVEMBER.  1948CABINEToff     MMILITARY TRAINING (FACILITIES)  bill memorandum by.the Parliamentary Undersecretaryof State for War1,     The Secretary of State for War was authorised by theLord President&apos;s Committee on 9th April, 1948 (L.P.(48)5th Meeting)to arrange, in consultation with other Ministers concerned, forthe drafting of a Bill, for introduction in the present Session,dealing with various facilities required for the use of landfor service training in peace-time,  and was invited by theCommittee to circulate the draft Bill when ready to the Cabinet.The draft Bill is now ready,  subject to two minor points of detail which are being considered by . the Minis try of Town and country Planning and the Ministry of Health respectively,  and itis accordingly circulated herewith for the information of theCabinet and for their approval in principle.    Because a numberof Bills, scheduled for introduction early in the Session, ofwhich this is one, have fallen behind the time-table contemplated in the Legislative Programme, the Lord President is anxious thatthis Bill should,  subject to Cabinet approval of the policy,be introduced as soon as possible, and for this purpose it is desired to bring it before the Legislation Committee at their next meeting.2,     The needs of the Armed Forces for land to be actually acquired by the Service Departments for training purposes have already been before the Cabinet (CM. (47) 93rd Conclusions, Minute 6) and were dealt with in Cmd. *aper 7278, The present Bill is not designed toenable -che Service Departments to acquire fresh training areas,but merely to facilitate their use of land remaining in private ownership.      The use for training purposes of land not belongingto the Service Departments is governed in normal times by theMilitary Manoeuvres Acts, 1897 and 1911.    (For the time beingemergency powers to use land not belonging to the service departments are available under Defence Regulation 52, whichhas been continued in force until 10th December, 1950, by theEmergency Laws (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1947)-   Thepowers conferred by the Military Manoeuvres Acts in normal timesare, however, no longer adequate to the requirements of forcesbeing trained under modern conditions.    The Act of 1897* whichwas only amended in detail by the Act of 1911,  of course didnot contemplate the needs of mechanized forces, or the advent of compulsory service.    These Acts envisaged set manoeuvres ina particular are for a period of less than three months in the summer of each year, and require the somewhat elaboratemachinery of a Military Manoeuvres Commission on each occasion of use of the powers.
3.     Now and for the future additional powers are needed, if thelarge forces raised by a system of national service are to be adequately trained in  the use of the expensive equipment withwhich they are to be provided.l\.t     The Bill anticipates the time when the emergency powersreferred to in paragraph 2 above,  enabling the use of. land forthe purposes of the Armed Forces, are no longer available.It is a logical sequel to the introduction of the compulsory service system in peace time, and the present, on the eve ofthe coming into operation of the National Service Act, I9I+8is thought a suitable time to table the proposals.5.     The increased size of the auxiliary forces calls for theprovision of widespread facilities, available without elaboratepreliminaries, for short-period exercises without firing, bysmall parties throughout the year,  so far as seasonalconditions allow,&apos; in places which are easily accessible tounits of those forces.6.      Secondly,  the high degree of mobility of modern forces,moving towards areas of War Department or other land over whichtraining rights exists involves long approach movements.    Ifthese are to be carried out under realistic conditions,  troopsmust be able to rest and bivouac when on the move towards theareas available for actual battle practice.7*     The general object of the present Bill is to give power touse small areas of land for a very limited time on each occasion,and power in that connection to  draw water for limited purposes,on giving a minimum of 1+8 hours&apos;  notice to the occupiers of theland.    It prohibits entry into any of the kinds of privatepremises protected by the -Military Manoeuvres Acts,  and itforbids firing of any kind during user.    With the severerestrictions imposed by the Bill,  the use of the proposedpowers should not prove unduly burdensome to the public at large or to land owners or farmers.8.      Care will be exercised in selecting land for use so thatno damage is done to arable land;    and, while the Bill wouldenable land to be used eompulsorily,  in practice the use of the required land will be mostly sought by agreement.9.     Only a very limited number of vehicles will be taken on toland used under the Bill,  except possibly during night bivouacs;and no tracked vehicles will be taken on to such land except ona minor exercise with a gun as indicated in the proviso to clause l(3)  of the Bill.10. The facilities to be given by the Bill will be requiredto some extent by the Royal Air Force and the Royal observer corps and also by the Royal Marines.11.    The Bill provides for compensation to be paid for damage on the lines of the Military Manoeuvres Act, 1897, and.administrative arrangements will be made for the promptsettlement of admissible claims to compensation.12.    Clause 1 defines the general scope of the powers to beprovided.    No mention is made of a maximum number of personspermitted to use the land nor a maximum number of vehicles tobe taken on to the land,  as any mention of maximum numbersmust be illusory except in relation to a definite area of land;and it is not oracticable to give any such definition in the Bill.
The area of land to be used at any time will be defined in thenotice given to the occupier beforehand.-   In practice, only very small parties of the order of some 2*,;feon, with not morethan three light wheeled, vehicles, will take part in the minorexercises.    The numbers concerned when bodies of troops are on the move in connection with large scale exercises would, ofcourse,, be greater, but the occasions will be much less frequent.13*    Clause 2(2)  indicates the limited extent to which power isrequired to do anything to the ground itself; and paragraph (b)of sub-clause (3) and sub-clause (4) follow the lines ofSection 7 of &quot;the Military Manoeuvres Act, 1897.    In that act the penalty, on summary conviction, for wilful obstruction is a fine of 40/- and for malicious damage a fine of  5.     Havingregard to the present-day value of money it seems reasonablethat the maximum penalty for e.ny offence of the kind indicatedshould be  10.14*    Clause 3.  sub-clauses (l)  and (2), provide substantially the protection of property afforded by provisos (l)  and (2) ofSection 2 of the Military Manoeuvres Act, 1897, as amended bySection 2 of the Military Manoeuvres Act, 1911.    The clause doesnot, however, include anything on the lines of proviso(3) ofSection 2 of the Military Manoeuvres Act, 1897. which statesthat &quot;nothing.......... shall prejudicially affect any publicright or any right of commonw;      as it may well happen thatin some circumstances a common would be used for a matter of hours by troops on the move.15*    Sub-clause (4) provides that the same land shall not beused more than 12 times in any one year.    Although, as stated above, it is hoped that the use of land will be mostly obtained by agreement-,  some restriction of this kind is desirable on theexercise of compulsory power.    The application of this provision will require co-ordination of the requirements of the three services.      I propose that requirements should be co-ordinatedfor each district at Army District Headquarters.16.   The limit of time of 48 hours provided in Clause 3(4) foreach use of land is more than will be usually required.    Aperiod of 24 hours will generally suffice;    but the higher figure is inserted to meet the possibility that throughunforeseeable circumstances the troops might not be able tovacate the land until a little after the expected time.17*    Clause 4(l), concerning compensation, follows very closely the lines of the compensation provided for in Section 6(l)  ofthe Military Manoeuvres Act, 1897. but the clause omits thewords occurring in that sub-section of the 1897 Act;    &quot;whetheror not (the damage is)  occasioned by the acts or defaults ofthe authorised forces&quot;, as those words might be held to includedamage by sightseers. -&apos; 18. . Clause 5(1&quot;) requires that notice shall be given not lessthan 48 hours beforehand of the proposed entry on, use of, or taking water from any land; and sub-clauses (2)(3) and (4)provide in detail the form of the notice and to whom it shallbe given. Sub-clauses (5), (6), (7) follow substantially thelines of Section 105 of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947*
19&quot;    Clause 6 excludes &quot;foreshore&quot; from the restrictiveprovisions of the Bill.    The term &quot;land&quot; includes &quot;foreshore&quot;;and the effect of Clause 6 is to enable &quot;foreshore&quot; to be used by boats- that, is &quot;otherwise than by persons and wheeledvehicles&quot; (see Clause l(3)), to be used if required more than12 times in a year (see Clause 3(4)),  and to be used without thgiving of prior notice (see Clause 5(l)).      I am advised thatit will often be a matter of considerable difficulty toascertain for certain to whom any particular foreshore belongsand it is not likely in practice that the owner or occupier of the foreshore would be prejudiced by the exercise of the&apos;powers under the Bill.20.    Clause 7 provides specifically for the Royal observer corps because that Corps is not.part of His Majesty&apos;s Forces.21.    The Bill has been the subject of consultation with thefollowing Departments, in addition to the Service departments and the Ministry of Defence,  via:-TreasuryHome office scottish office ministry of health ministry of Agriculture and fisheries ministry of education ministry of transport ministry of Town and Country PlanningMinistry of works and, subject to a possible amendment in Clause 3(l)  to prohibitentry on or interference with &quot;nature reserves&quot;, referred toin the Huxley Report &quot;Conservation of Nature in England andWales&quot; (Cmd. 7122),  and to a possible amendment in Clause 5(h)defining the source of supply of water, on which the Ministryof Health are being consulted,  the draft Bill has been agreed by all Departments consulted.M.S.War Office, S.W.I.22ND NOVEMBER,   1948.
