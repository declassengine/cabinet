THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1948SECRET Copy No. 3CP. (48) 2897th December, 1948CABINETREPUBLIC OF IRELAND BILL : EFFECT ON NORTHERN ireland note by the Prime MinisterFOR purposes of record I circulate the following note of the points raised in my recent conversation with the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland aboutthe effect on Northern Ireland of Eire&apos;s ceasing to be a member of theCommonwealth.2. I invited Sir Basil Brooke to stay at Chequers on 20th November sothat we might have an opportunity of discussing these developments, and Ihad a long conversation with him after dinner that evening. I described tohim the course of the conversations between Eire Ministers and the representativesof the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, both at theChequers meeting on 17th October and at the subsequent meetings in Parison 15th and 16th November; and I explained the policy which, with the full support of those representatives of other Commonwealth countries, we nowproposed to follow in declaring that, despite the repeal of the External relations act, we should not regard Eire as a foreign State. Sir Basil Brooke saidthat, so far as Northern Ireland was concerned, he could not raise any objectionto the line of policy which we proposed to follow. Indeed, in view of the courseof the conversations with Eire Ministers, he did not consider that the UnitedKingdom Government or other Commonwealth Governments could reasonably have adopted any other policy.3. Sir Basil Brooke added, however, that he and his Government must keepin mind the ultimate objectives of the Eire Government as regards partition.They must, in particular, be on their guard against any large influx of eire citizens who, having acquired some colourable pretext for exercising the franchise,might help to out-vote the loyalists in Northern Ireland on the partition issue.He therefore thought it possible that, when Eire had ceased to be a memberof the Commonwealth, his Government might wish to tighten up still further the qualifications for the local franchise in Northern Ireland. I replied thatthis was a matter for the Government of Northern Ireland and that, if they36234
2thought it necessary to amend their legislation on this point, the United KingdomGovernment would raise no objection. Sir Basil Brooke said that it was also possible, though less likely, that his Government might wish to suggest some changes in the qualifications for voting in Northern Ireland elections to the parliament at Westminster. To this I replied that, if the Government ofNorthern Ireland found it necessary to make representations on this point, these would be carefully considered by the United Kingdom Government. I couldnot, however, give at this stage any indication of the view which United kingdom ministers might take. It was likely to be found administratively impracticable for Returning Officers at elections in Great Britain to distinguish between eire citizens and British subjects; and it might be difficult to propose differentqualifications for voting, in Great Britain and Northern Ireland respectively,for elections to the same Parliament.4. Sir Basil Brooke said that his immediate anxieties would be allayedif he could be given an assurance that the constitutional position of NorthernIreland would not be prejudiced by Eire&apos;s ceasing to be a member of the Common-wealth. I gave him, on behalf of the United Kingdom Government, an assurance that the constitutional position of Northern Ireland would be fully safeguarded;and I added, in reply to a further question, that he was at liberty to say publicly that he had received that assurance.5. Sir Basil Brooke said that early in the following week he was meetingthe Members of Parliament representing constituencies in Northern Ireland, andwould take the opportunity of telling them that he had been fully informed ofthe course of the recent discussions with Eire Ministers and of the policy whichthe United Kingdom Government proposed to follow. While he could not antici-pate the statement of policy which was to be made in the House of Commonslater in the week, he would say that the Prime Minister had satisfied him thatthe constitutional position of Northern Ireland would be fully safeguarded. he hoped that this might have some influence in restraining these Members fromraising unnecessary difficulties in the House of Commons.6. Sir Basil Brooke went on to mention a number of detailed points whichhis Government would probably wish to raise as a result of Eire&apos;s ceasing to bea member of the Commonwealth. On these a formal communication from theGovernment of Northern Ireland may be expected in due course; but it may be convenient if I add here the following summary of them :  (a) If Eire was now to take the title &quot; Republic of Ireland &quot; the North couldnot conveniently continue to be known as &quot; Northern Ireland.&quot; TheGovernment of Northern Ireland would probably ask that their titleshould be formally changed to &quot; Ulster.&quot;(b) It might be possible for His Majesty to revive, in respect of Ulster, theOrder of St. Patrick.(c) Would Irish representative peers from Eire be entitled to continue to sit in the House of Lords ? Should it not be considered whether theelection of Irish representative peers should be revived, and confined to Ulster ?
(d) Was it desirable that the lights round the coast of Northern ireland should continue to be controlled from Dublin?       .(e) It might be necessary to review the &quot; Imperial &quot; functions of the Belfastbranch of the Bank of Ireland.(/) Although this was not strictly consequential upon Eire&apos;s ceasing to be amember of the Commonwealth, this opportunity might well be takento reach a settlement with the Eire Government of the troubles whichhave arisen as a result of poaching from Eire in the fisheries owned by the Irish Society in the River Foyle. If these troubles were notsettled amicably, there was a risk that the Eire Government might make difficulties over the use by His Majesty&apos;s ships of the deepwater channel in Lough Foyle.C. R.
