As you will be aware, discussions took place in Parison 16th November between Eire Ministers and Mr. fraser, Mr. Pearson,Dr. Evatt, the Lord Chancellor and myself to consider the position which would result from the coming into force of the Act to repeal the Eire External Relations Act.      These were&apos; in continuation ofthe similar discussions at Chequers on 17th&apos; October.      Canada,Australia and1New Zealand participated as being the:other commonwealth countries in which there arc particularly largenumbers of. people of Irish extraction.      The Sire Act, entitled the Republic of Ireland Act, was given a first reading in the bail .on 17th November, and second reading is to be taken on Wednesday,24th November.2.      The discussions at Paris were broadly on the questionwhether it would be possible for Eire and the commonwealth countries &apos; to&apos;continue t* grant privileged treatment inter se inrespect of trade and nationality, having regard to the terms ofthe most-favoured-nation clauses of commercial treaties betweenthe various Commonwealth countries and foreign countries.&apos;1    all those present at the meeting appreciated the international difficulties which might result from the removal of Eire1s link &apos;/with the Crown
. -2-with the Crown.      The Dominion and Eire representatives were however confident as to the possibilities, under internationallaw and practice, of continuing the status quo, as regards theexchange of privileges after the coming into force of theRepublic of Ireland Act.      The United Kingdom representatives were particularly concerned in relation to the large amount ofUnited Kingdom export trade to foreign countries which might beaffected.3.      The following is a summary of the position as it was left at the conclusion of the Paris discussions on 16th November.These proposals were ad referendum to the Governments.      Summarybegins.(i)    In speeches in the Bail on the Republic of, IrelandBill the spokesman of the Eire Government will be careful toavoid saying anything which would increase the legal andpolitical difficulties which Commonwealth Governments willhave in explaining the position which will result from this legislation;(ii)    For their part Commonwealth Governments will refrain from public statements which will make it more difficult forthem to maintain that, despite the repeal of the external relations ^ct, Eire is not a foreign country.-&apos;(iii)    When the British Nationality Act, 19h8s comes intooperation on 1st January, 19-1+9, the Eire Government will make an order under section.23 (2) of their Citizenship Actproviding that, in view of section 3 of our Actj citizens ofthe United Kingdom and Colonies shall enjoy comparable rights.and privileges in Eire.     As and when other commonwealth countries bring into effect legislation corresponding to section 3 of the British Nationality.Act, 19h8, the eire government will extend &quot;to them, by orders made under section 23/of their
of tVieir Citizenship Aet,  corresponding rights of citizenship.(iv.)   At :a Inter stage , and possibly, within the next six -months or so, the Eire Government will undertake a comprehensiverevision of their citizenship law;    and they will then take theopportunity of making a direct statutory provision conferring.   :-,citizenship rights comparable with&apos;those conferred by section 3of the British Nationality Act^ 19U8, on the citizens of all such Commonwealth countries as have enacted legislationcorresponding to that sOction.(v)    The intention to take&apos; the action summarised in sub-paragraphs (iii) and- (Lv) above will be announced in the course -of the:debates on the Bill for&apos; the repeal of the. external relations A.et.(vi) . The- Eire --&quot;GoVerrarieht will collaborate with the UnitedKingdom Government, and any other interested commonwealth governments/, in resisting any claims which may be made by foreign countries, on most-favoured-nation grounds, to share the special-privileges which Eire and those countries willcontinue... to accord to one another and to one another1 s citizens,whether in matter-s of trade or in the treatment of nationals.Summary ends.,h*     United Kingdom Ministers have matter urgently underconsideration and&apos;the indications are that they will hope to lot the eire Government know in a day&apos;or two that they agree to go forward,on this basis.provided that Eire Government for their part areprepared to do so and the other Commonwealth Governments are inagreement.&quot;5V&quot;&apos; Matter is very urgent as Ei.ro Government must state their position when their Bill is Introduced ;lh the &apos; Bail - on - 21+th November.Moreover, United Kingdom Government&apos;regard it as essential to makei&quot;, V&quot;&apos;..        &apos; \&apos;i /a. corresponding
a corresponding statement in Parliament as to their attitude onThursday. 25th November, i.o. the day following the Bail secondreading debate.,6,     As ^regards statembht&apos; &apos;tb.;bo made by Hiiro Government--ih&quot;the course of introducing the?&quot;Bill in the Bail on 24th November,it was suggested to &apos;Mr. MacBridev. at-Paris that this might be-in,-.,the sense of. the- test given in&apos; my Immediately.-following telegramY.No.107.   -&apos; Sire Government are now considering this text (which,it has been pointed out, would in- any case need amendment to coverall the countries of the Commonwealth,) and if they arc prepared ,;togo forward on the basis proposed, they would let United KingdomGovernment have in advance&apos;a final text.7.      As regards statement to be made by United&apos;KingdomGovernment in Parliament on 25th November a first draft has beenprepared on the official level,  text of which is given in my nextimmediately following telegram Y,No,108.&apos;     This draft has not yet  -been considered by United Kingdom:Ministers and will have to beagreed with Eire Government.    : Text therefore has&apos; no specialauthority but is sent to you as an indication of what is in mind. -8.     -All the above is/strictly for your own information at.this stage.     But it is likely that further telegram will be sentto you, probably on Sunday,  asking, you to approach Bominion.authorities urgently asking them to agree beforO 21+th November(when proceedings in Bail take place), to go forward for their part oh the basis proposed in paragraph 3 and if so that they willalso make a public statement (but: not before 25th November) oh the.lines of..-the statement to be made by United Kingdom Government..-.Copy to:-Prirae Ministers&apos; Meeting (Const.)

Fu 11  reports of xJaris discussions had boon received from Pearson but it had not been realised here that second reading in Dail&apos;of Republic of Ireland Bill would takeplace so soon.2.     Whole position was discussed late this afternoon at ministerial meeting presided over by St. Laurent at which various aspects of problem wore considered with senior officials.Meeting lasted two hours and a half after which Escott Reid hadtalk with me on St. Laurent&apos;s instructions.      Following is upshot.3.     Atmosphere of meeting was apparently very cool&quot; towardsEire and it was felt that these very important matters were being dealt with in unseemly haste,      It was recognised that this was due to Irish pressure but it was felt that Eire Government shouldhave, been told very firmly to postpone the second reading of theirBill.      Canadian Ministers take a very poor view of their actionanyway but that they should attempt to rush members of theCommonwealth in this manner was regarded as altogetherunbecoming. .../4.     However Ministers
-2-4.      However Ministers recognised that thoy had no - choic&apos;&quot;now but to consider the suggestions put forward by the UnitedKingdom Government.     But it was clear from the start that theycould not be as forthcoming in the matter as wo proposed to boin our statement.      In the first place new legislation would borequired here to enable Eire citizens to bo treated as if thoywore British subjects and the question of the propriety anddesirability of introducing such legislation would have .to be vercarefully considered.      The Government certainly could not commit themselves on the point at present.      Secondly thoro were in anycase limits to what the Federal Government could themselvesundertake to do since in this country many of the rights of individuals depend on provincial lav/;    consultation with theprovinces would therefore be required and this could only takeplace- after further study.      Thirdly the position, as to preferencand trade treatment generally was by no means clear and wouldhave to receive detailed examination,5.      In these circumstances the furthest that.the canadian government could go would bo to make a very brief statement on25th&apos;November the effect of which would be to recognise theexistence of s special association between Canada and Fire and tcleave the implications of this to be examined and sorted out.It was proposed to put this to the Cabinet tomorrow (Wednesday)morning for approval.     h first draft of the suggested statement had been prepared and a copy of this was handed to me,-     Text is contained in my Immediately following telegram.-     I was informed that the same time that subject to Cabinet approval a letter wouldbo sent to me saying that in the Canadian Government1s view theproposals contained in paragraph 3 of your telegram Y.N0..IO6appeared to be generally acceptable though the  question, of bringing into effect in Canada legislation corresponding to m./Section 3 of

As a result of the conclusions of Ministers it is felt necessary to suggest to us certain amendments in theproposed United Kingdom statement.      These arc contained in mysecond immediately following telegram together with Canadiancomments on the proposed Eire statement.
