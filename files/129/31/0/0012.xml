THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT /Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1948 ^ g gSECRET Copy No. 31CP. (48) 28225th November, 1948CABINETCOST OF NEW SCHEMES IN MEN AND MONEYMemorandum by the Prime minister it is most important that, when the Cabinet or one of its Committees is considering any proposal involving new or extended administrative commitments,it should have before it the best estimate that can be made of the probable costin man-power as well as money. I appreciate that it is often difficult to make these estimates with precision, in advance; but it is essential that ministers should be able to judge, before a policy is approved, not only whether it isdesirable on its merits, but also whether the country can afford it.2. For some years past it has been the rule that any proposal put forward for approval by the Cabinet or one of its Committees, which would involve theemployment of staff in Government Departments, should include an estimateof the staff required. This rule was reaffirmed in a Treasury Circular to Depart-ments of 1st August, 1947 (T.C. No. 16/47), which asked that estimates shouldalso be given, where practicable, of any additional staff likely to be required,outside Government Departments, by public boards, local authorities and thebusiness and general community.3. In regard to cost, there is a long-standing rule, to which I referred inmy memorandum on Cabinet Procedure (CP. (46) 199), that proposals which involve expenditure or affect general financial and economic policy should always be discussed with the Treasury and, if Treasury agreement has not been securedat the official level, with the Chancellor of the Exchequer before they are submitted to the Cabinet or a Cabinet Committee.4. Recent experience suggests that these rules are in danger of being over-looked. I therefore ask all Ministers in charge of Departments to take special care to ensure that any proposals submitted by them to the Cabinet or one of36183
its Committees shall, if they would involve the employment of additional staffor would place a financial burden on the Exchequer, be accompanied by anestimate of (a) The man-power likely to be required by Government Departments (andalso, where practicable, an estimate of the man-power required outsidethe Government service).(6) The cost to the Exchequer, whether direct or through grants-in-aid oflocal rates.An indication should always be given that the cost to the Exchequer hasbeen discussed with the Treasury; and special attention should be drawn to proposals of whose potential man-power requirements the Treasury have not beeninformed.The Chairmen of Cabinet Committees should regard the fulfilment of theseconditions as, in the ordinary way, a pre-requisite to consideration of the proposal by the Committee.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,25th November, 1948.
