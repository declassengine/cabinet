DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT)IB C R E Tp. P. (48)  29kiITH DECEMBER,  1948COPY NO.     ^ \CABINETACQUISITION OF LAND FOR AGRICULTURE AND PORESTRYMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries the proposal put forward by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP. (48) 273) that in future District Valuers should carry out valuations and conduct negotiations for t?ie acquisitionof land by the Ministry of Agriculture and the forestry commission is, in my opinion, undesirable and unnecessary.2. Acquisitions by the Ministry of Agriculture under the agriculture Act,  1947, are likely to be considerable.      the forestry Commission have purchased, over 1 million acres andleased 400,000 acres since 1919 and have an extensive programme in prospect.      Both Departments must possess professional staff, andthey are in fact competent to undertake valuations and negotiateacquisitions of agricultural land.      To forbid my staff to under-take acquisitions would be a waste of an important part of theirprofessional knowledge;3* Land cannot be valued only by reference to records of past transactions or to prices fetched by other land in the locality.     Adjoining farms vary widely in value according to soilqualities, ,agricultural equipment and other factors.      The valueof any one farm may change considerably over a fairly short period as a result of the progress of agricultural knowledge,more particularly during a period of rapid, agricultural cLevelop-ment such as the present.      The daily work of the professionalstaff in my Departments gives them the intimate knowledge of modern farming practice required for the proper valuation of landfor agricultural and. forestry purposes.      This knowledge cannotbe passed on to District Valuers, many of whom do not possess itand have no opportunity to acquire it.4* The acquisition of land by my Departments for agricul-rtural and forestry purposes is not complicated by the Town and country Planning Act,  1947.      Such land will seldom possess any development value.      Since it will be acquired by the State for agriculture or forestry no development charges will be payable.Save for rare exceptions,  therefore, District Valuers will haveno occasion to assess the existing use value of such land for thepurpose of that Act.% Moreover, many acquisitions under the Agriculture Actwill be of neglected or partially derelict land in order that itmay be put to full and efficient use.      My officers will havebeen statutorily responsible for taking action or preparing a   reports on such land, and they will have an intimate knowledge ofits history and its owner.      District Valuers could not possesssuch knowledge.      Even where land is being acquired for other agricultural reasons, or for forestry, my officers will have tomake a thorough inspection,  and preliminary valuation of the land,and also have discussions with the owner before it is decided to open negotiations.      To bring in the District Valuer at that stage would result in duplication of work and waste of man-power.
6. I agree that District Valuers may have in their officesrecords or information which may provide a useful check in somecases.      My officers will also have much information which mightmaterially assist District Valuers in their other acquisitionwork.      Such informations where not confidential;, can be inter-changed by consultation.      Moreover, there should be no diffi-culty in securing any necessary co-ordination of valuationprinciples, possibly by a central committee.Summary and Conclusion.7. To summarise.(i)    Both my Departments must carry professional staff whoare competent to carry out valuation and acquisitionof land for agriculture and forestry.(ii)    This staff, by reason of their daily work in connec-tion with agriculture, and their knowledge of thepast history of land to be acquired, are betterqualified for and more experienced in this work thanDistrict Valuers.(iii)    Before a decision to buy land can be taken, there mustbe a thorough inspection, preliminary valuation,and discussion with the owner by my officers.      Itwould be duplication of work and waste of man-power to bring in District Valuers at that stage.(iv)    Land to be acquired by my Departments for agricultureand forestry will seldom have any development value,and no development charges are likely to be payablesubsequently.      It cannot therefore affect theoperation of the Town and Country Planning Act.8. I would therefore ask my colleagues to agree that the professional staff attached to the Ministry of Agriculture andthe Forestry Commission should continue to be authorised toundertake valuations and negotiations for the acquisition ofland by my two Departments and that their valuation figures should be accepted by the Treasury for the purpose of financialauthority for acquisitions.T..W.istry of Agriculture and Fisheries,S.
