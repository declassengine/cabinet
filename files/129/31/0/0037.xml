THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  December 1948SECRET Copy No. 3 1CP. (48) 30730*/i December, 1948CABINETCOMMONWEALTH  NOMENCLATUREMemorandum by the Prime MinisterSOME confusion has been caused and wrong deductions drawn from theform of the final communique issued at the end of the recent Meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers. It has been suggested that the word &quot; British &quot;was deliberately omitted before the word &quot; Commonwealth &quot; and that this repre-sented a significant change of policy. In fact, this is not so. There was no occasion in that document to refer to the Commonwealth by title and the titlewas not in fact mentioned either as &quot; the Commonwealth of Nations &quot; or as&apos;4 the British Commonwealth of Nations.&quot; What was unusual in that communique&apos;was the frequent use of such expressions as &quot; Commonwealth countries,&quot;&apos;&quot;&apos; Commonwealth Governments,&quot; and &quot; Members of the Commonwealth.&quot; This,however, was due, not to any conscious desire to omit the term &quot;British,&quot; butto the avoidance of the word &quot;Dominion.&quot;2. As these misunderstandings are apt to arise, I think it is important that we should all be clear in our own minds about the ideas underlying these points of nomenclature.The main principle is that all the fully self-governing countries of theCommonwealth are independent peoples and that the United Kingdom, thoughdoubtless primiis inter pares, has constitutionally no more than an equal statuswith the others. It is important, therefore, to avoid all phrases which mightbe taken to imply that the other fully self-governing countries of the Common-wealth are in any way subordinated to the Government or people of the UnitedKingdom.   Thus: --: (a) The term &quot;Dominion&quot; and &quot;Dominion Government&quot; should be avoided; such expressions as &quot;Commonwealth country,&quot; &quot;Common-wealth Government &quot; or &quot; Member of the Commonwealth &apos;&apos; shouldbe used instead in all official publications and correspondence.   This36315
carries to its logical conclusion the change which was made when a&quot; Commonwealth Relations Office &quot; took the place of the &quot; dominions office.&quot;(6) The use of the term &quot; Dominion status &quot; should similarly be abandoned,in favour of such expressions as &quot; become a fully independent Memberof the Commonwealth&quot; or &quot;attain independence within theCommonwealth.&apos;&apos;(c) No other opportunity should be lost of using language which stressesthe fact that all the fully self-governing countries of the Common-wealth are of equal status. Thus, the term &quot; Commonwealth PrimeMinisters &quot; should in future be used to describe the Prime ministers of all Commonwealth countries, including the United Kingdom.3. It should not, however, be overlooked that the Commonwealth includes the Colonies and other dependent territories, some of which are under theadministration of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The expression&quot; Commonwealth countries &quot; therefore includes the Colonies and those other territories. The phrase &quot; Commonwealth and Empire,&quot; which convenientlyimplies a distinction between the self-governing and dependent parts of the whole,has no constitutional authority and is permissible only in colloquial use. In allformal documents, therefore, when it is intended to exclude dependent territoriesit will be necessary to use the terms, &quot; fully self-governing countries of theCommonwealth&quot; or, more simply, &quot;Members of the Commonwealth.&quot; (Adependent territory is not a Member of the Commonwealth.)4. On the use of the term &quot;British&quot; it is not possible to be so specific.The phrase &quot; British Commonwealth of Nations &quot; was, I think, first invented byField-Marshal Smuts and was brought into more general use by those who soughta title for the British Empire which seemed more nearly in accord with modernideas and constitutional practice. When it received statutory recognition in theStatute of Westminster, it was natural that in a formal instrument of that kindit should take the form &quot;British Commonwealth of Nations.&quot; But for lessformal purposes there has for a long time past been a tendency to use the simplerform &quot; Commonwealth of Nations,&quot; which is fully appropriate for most ordinaryoccasions and in addition has a special attraction for those who, for one reason or another, are anxious to avoid emphasising the &quot;British&quot; aspect of theassociation. This tendency has increased in recent times. While Australia andNew Zealand attach great importance to the term &quot; British,&quot; other parts of theCommonwealth, e.g., South Africa and India, have their own reasons for wishing to avoid it. ^ It is natural that Asiatic peoples, in particular, should feel thatthe application of the term to them implies some degree of subordination to the&quot; British &quot; peoples. Either description &quot; British Commonwealth of Nations &quot;or &quot; Commonwealth of Nations &quot; can properly be used as a description of thewhole body of sovereign independent communities with their dependent territories.The choice between the two has turned sometimes on the context, sometimes on the: individual tastes of the user.
10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,30th December, 1948.5. At their meeting on 28th October (CM. (48) 67th Conclusions, Minute 4),the Cabinet agreed that it would be useful to establish, without any formalchange, a convention of describing the Commonwealth as &quot; the Commonwealthof Nations,&quot; and that this change should be defended, if necessary, on the basis that it was an object of our policy to make it possible for natidns to remain within the Commonwealth after they had attained their independence, even though they felt that, by reason of their race and history, they could not properly be described as &quot;British &quot; nations. I do not now suggest that this decision shouldbe modified; for it does not follow from it that we should not make even occasionaluse of the full phrase &quot; the British Commonwealth of Nations.&quot; Shortly after we had referred in the communique to &apos;&apos; countries of the Commonwealth,&apos;&apos; I myself,in my speech at the Mansion House, referred, to &quot;the British Commonwealthof Nations.&quot; In formal documents (e.g. communications to foreign Powers) itwill often be necessary to use the full title. Nor is there any reason, as I have said, why we should not use it from to time to time, according to context, inspeeches or in writen documents. But where there is doubt we can and should prefer the shorter title, &quot; the Commonwealth of Nations.&quot;6. I should be glad if my colleagues would issue suitable instructions, basedon this paper, to all members of their Departments (whether at home or overseas)who deal with matters on which it would be useful to them to have this guidance.C. R. A.
