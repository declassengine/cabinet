/ /VSECRETCP. (48) 287.3.QTH NOVEMBER,  1948MILITARY TRAINING (FACILITIES)  bill memorandum by the Lord President of the council. In accordance with, the decision of the Cabinet on25th November. 1948 (c.M.(48) 76th Conclusions, Minute 4),  theLegislation Committee have examined the question whether thedraft Military Training (Facilities) Bill could be amended tomeet the objections which would be raised against it by.agri-cultural and other interests.    In considering this matter theCommittee had the assistance of a memorandum by the LordChancellor,  indicating in detail the kind of safeguards which,might be introduced into the Bill, and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War indicated a willingness to acceptseveral of these suggestions.2. At present the temporary use of land for militarytraining is governed, by Defence Regulation 52, which has been continued in force until 10th December, 1950, by the EmergencyLaws (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1947*   No serious difficulty has arisen in the operation of the Defence Regulation;   but theefforts which are being made to give National Service men more effective training and the longer period of training proposed inthe National Service Bill will involve greater use of land andmay draw attention to the wide powers which the defence regulation confers.3. It may take some time to secure the right balance betweenmilitary requirements and the needs of agriculture and otherusers of land, and it seems to be undesirable to rush the drafting of the necessary permanent legislation.COPY NO.S lCABINET4* The general feeling among members of the legislation committee was that reliance should be placed for the time being on Defence Regulation 52.   Meantime the War Office, in con-sultation with the Departments concerned, should work out whatadministrative safeguards should be introduced into the operationof the Defence Regulation while it remains in force;    and, in thelight of those discussions and of further experience, should proceed with the drafting of.the permanent legislation which willbe required when the Defence Regulation comes to an end.    It isnot necessary that this amending legislation should be introduced in the present Parliament;    It could be one of the first piecesof legislation introduced in the new Parliament or, alternatively,if that proved to be difficult,  the Defence Regulation could bekept in force for a further year.5. I accordingly propose that the Cabinet should agree notto proceed meantime with the Military Training (Facilities) Bill?and that the Lord President1s Committee should in due courseconsider the results of the further discussions which the WarOffice are to have with various interested Departments.H.M.Office of the Lord President of the Council.30th November, 1948.IS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS  GOVERNMENT)
