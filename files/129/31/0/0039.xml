Pearson, Secretary of State for External Affairs.A us tralia The Right Hon. H. V. Evatt, K.C., Deputy Prime Minister of Australia.New Zealand The Right Hon. Peter Fraser, Prime Minister of New Zealand.- Mr. ATTLEE said that he had recently received through the HighCommissioner for India in London a further message from Pandit Nehru(Annex A) regarding India&apos;s future relations with the Commonwealth. this must be regarded as a reply to the representations made to Pandit Nehru throughSir Girja Bajpai after the meeting with Commonwealth representatives in Parison 17th November. It was very fortunate that Mr. Fraser, Dr. Evatt andMr. Pearson should be in London so soon after the receipt of this message, andhe was glad to have this opportunity of discussing Pandit Nehru&apos;s reply withthem.It was clear from Pandit Nehru&apos;s message that after discussions with theCongress Party he found himself unable to accept any substantial link withthe Crown. On the basis of the Eight Points now put forward, it would bevery difficult for other Commonwealth countries to accept India as a full memberof the Commonwealth. If full membership were conceded on the basis of an association not involving any substantial link through the Crown, there was grave danger of weakening the Commonwealth connection between those countries which still wished to preserve the common allegiance to the Crown. At the same time,India clearly wished to maintain a close association with the Commonwealth,and there were very great advantages for all Commonwealth countries inpreserving that association, particularly at the present time.   He had specially36312THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
in mind the Communist threat to South-East Asia and the difficulties whicnwould arise, so long as the Kashmir dispute was unsettled, if Pakistan remained a member of the Commonwealth and India severed all connection with it. Inview of the great efforts Avhich Pandit Nehru had made to preserve India s association with the Commonwealth, it was most undesirable that his latestmessage should be answered in a way which might be construed as a rebuff. Inthese circumstances it seemed to him that even though India could not be accepted as a full member of the Commonwealth on the basis now suggested, every effort must be made to devise means of enabling her to continue in a special association with the Commonwealth. At an earlier stage much thought had been given tothe possibility of a &quot; two-tier &apos;&apos; association comprising an inner ring of Britishnations and an outer ring of associated states. This conception was by no meansfree from difficulty and had hitherto been rejected; but, if it were not possiblefor India to become a full member, the implications of that other form of associa-tion ought to be reviewed again. Special thought would have to be given tothe question whether our obligations under the &apos;&apos; most-favoured-nationprovisions of commercial treaties would allow us to concede special privileges,in trade and the treatment of nationals, to countries which were &quot; associated withthe Commonwealth.&quot; If so, it would be necessary to find some other practicaldistinction between member states and &quot; associates.&quot; For it would be difficultto sustain the position that India, though unable to accept obligations of full membership, had been conceded, as an &quot; associate,&quot; all the practical privileges and advantages which member states enjoyed.LORD JO WITT said that the special privileges in trade and treatment wereto be continued for Eire, even though she ceased to be a member of the Common-wealth. Surely it would be possible to continue them for India, if she continuedto be &quot; associated &quot; with the Commonwealth. Pandit INehru proposed, in thefourth of his Eight Points, that India should not treat Commonwealth countries as foreign states or their citizens as foreigners, and in particular that india should make it clear in any future commercial treaties that, for the purposes ofthe &quot; most-favoured-nation &quot; clause, Commonwealth countries were not regardedas foreign states. He also proposed in the second of his Eight Points that india should adopt the link of Commonwealth citizenship.Dr. EVATT said that he was in general agreement with the views which mr. Attlee had expressed. It was of the greatest political importance that india&apos;s association with the Commonwealth should be continued. Australia was particularly concerned to secure this in view of her special interests in South-east asia. The proposals now put forward by Pandit Nehru did not, he agreed,afford a sufficient basis for full membership of the Commonwealth. australia would certainly desire that, for full membership, there should be some substantialrecognition of the Crown. But was it certain that India could not be persuaded to accept a more substantial link through the Crown ? First, was it to be assumed that Pandit Nehru had finally rejected the suggestion put to him throughSir Girja Bajpai that, as a symbol of Commonwealth association, India&apos;s authorityto appoint Heads of Missions abroad should derive from The King? Secondly,could not something more be made of the suggestion in the sixth of pandit nehru&apos;s Eight Points that the President of the Indian Republic should act onThe King&apos;s behalf for the purpose of protecting in India Commonwealth citizensother than Indian nationals? Thirdly, might not India be ready to accept TheKing as the fountain of honour for the Commonwealth ? He still hoped that by some such means as these, India might be able to preserve a substantial link with the Crown such as would warrant her continuing in full membership ofthe Commonwealth. If, however, that proved impossible, he certainly consideredthat India, though not a full member, should be kept in a special association with the Commonwealth. In that event, however, further time was requiredto work out the implications of this new form of association. At short notice,he could not say what practical distinctions could be drawn between member states and &quot;associates.&quot;Mr. FRASER agreed that the present proposals did not afford a sufficientbasis for full membership of the Commonwealth. Public opinion in New Zealandwould resent any suggestion that full membership of the Commonwealth couldbe accorded to a country which was not prepared to recognise the special positionof the Crown. He stressed, however, the great importance of retaining indian a close association with the Commonwealth. He fully agreed with all that hadbeen said on that point. He would be ready to say in New Zealand that &quot; associa-tion   was not so close a relationship as membership; but it would be advantageous
3276if there could be time to work out the practical distinctions between the positionof member states and that of &quot;associates.&quot;Mr. PEARSON also agreed that the present proposals did not afford asufficient basis for full membership of the Commonwealth. At the same time,Pandit Nehru clearly desired that India should continue to be associated withthe Commonwealth; and the particular links which he proposed were sufficiently strong to make it highly undesirable that Commonwealth countries should appeal&apos;to rebuff his desire to continue efforts for a close continuing association. It oughtto be possible to work out a basis for distinguishing between member states and&quot; associates &quot; but it was essential that the Commonwealth countries should have more time in which to examine the implications of this distinction. He wouldnot himself exclude the possibility that an assocation based initially on commoncitizenship and practical collaboration might eventually develop into full member-ship through the gradual building up of more formal links through the Crown.Canada would certainly wish to do all she could to keep India in some formalassociation with the Commonwealth.In discussion further reference was made to the possibility of creating a link with the Crown through the grant of Commonwealth honours. Pandit Nehruhad apparently withdrawn this suggestion because objection had been taken toit in its original form, which contemplated that the honours would be granted by The King as &apos;&apos; First Citizen &apos;&apos; of the Commonwealth. It was possible, however,that India might be able to agree that The King as Head of the commonwealth should grant something like a Commonwealth Order of Merit to persons whohad performed outstanding service for the Commonwealth: Such awards, whichwould not carry any title, would be made on the advice of Commonwealth Govern -ments. They could be linked with the conception of Commonwealth citizenship.The view was expressed that for full membership a link with the Crown throughCommonwealth honours alone would not be sufficient, and that for &quot; association &quot;such a link was not necessary. It was, however, the general view that the ideaof Commonwealth honours should not be wholly rejected.After further discussion it was agreed that an interim message should besent to Pandit Nehru in the terms set out in Annex B.17th December, 1948.ANNEX a text of Pandit Nehru&apos;s Memorandum dated 11th December, 1948My ten-point memorandum dated 28th October, 1948, should be revised,being reduced to eight points as follows : -&apos;1. The declaration as to the status of India will be left as at present inthe draft constitution.2. In a Nationality Act, to be passed by the Indian Legislature, contempo-raneously with the coming into effect of the new constitution, there will be incorporated the substance of the relevant provisions of the British nationality act, 1948, which will have the effect of making Indian nationals commonwealth citizens and the nationals of any Commonwealth country Commonwealth citizenswhen they are in India. This arrangement will be on a reciprocal basis.:&quot; Commonwealth &quot; in this connection does not mean a super-State but standsfor an association of fre^ and independent States which accept this concept of commonwealth citizenship.3. As soon as the constitutional changes are settled, or at such other time as may be agreed upon, the Prime Minister of India and the Prime Ministerof the United Kingdom will make declarations announcing the changes and their nature and results.4. In any new legislation, or new treaties entered into with other countries,the Commonwealth countries will not be treated as foreign States and theircitizens will not be treated as foreigners.In particular, in any new commercial treaties it will be made clear that forthe purpose of the &quot; most-favoured-nation &quot; clause the Commonwealth countries are in a special position and are not regarded as foreign States.
5. In foreign States where the Indian Government has no representation,it will be at liberty to make use of any other Commonwealth country&apos;s ambassadoror minister; and the Indian Government will be willing to provide reciprocalfacilities for any Commonwealth Government that so desires.G. For the purposes of fulfilling the obligations of the Crown towardsCommonwealth citizens other than Indian nationals, the President of the IndianRepublic may at the request of the Crown act on behalf of The King Avithin the territories of India. A similar arrangement on a reciprocal basis will applyto Indian nationals in the rest of the Commonwealth.7. So far as the United Kingdom is concerned, the position is that generallyspeaking The King waived all functions of sovereignty in relation to indian favour of the people of India in pursuance of the Act of 1947. Under thatAct there would be no further legislation on India by the Parliament of theUnited Kingdom, and after India&apos;s new Constitution comes into force there canbe no such legislation. The Indian people and their representatives, includingthe President of the Republic, will thus exercise all functions of sovereignty.8. These proposals represent a sincere desire to continue the Common-wealth association and what is practical and adequate at present. No doubt as the relationship is not a static arrangement, further development by way of association may take place.ANNEX BMessage from the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to Pandit Nehrudated 16th December, 1948I have had an opportunity to-night to discuss with Mr. Fraser, Dr. Evattand Mr. Pearson your message of 11th December.Your proposals in their present form do not seem to us to be satisfactory as a basis for continuing the full degree of association within theCommonwealth through the nexus of the Crown. We hope that you may be ableto give this matter further consideration. If, however, you are unable after suchreconsideration to alter your position in this matter, we nevertheless earnestlytrust that a close Commonwealth association can still be maintained, and we welcome and share the view which you express in this regard in paragraph 8 ofyour message. We must, however, have time in which to work out some of themain implications of this form of Commonwealth association.Commonwealth citizenship must, in any event, be a main feature of anysuch association, and we hope that you will proceed with the action contemplated in your paragraph 2.This message represents the views of Mr. Fraser, Dr. Evatt and Mr. Pearson,as well as my own. You will realise, of course, that my Commonwealth colleagueshave not had an opportunity of consulting their Governments.
