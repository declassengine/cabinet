Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1948166SECRET Gopy No.  31CP. (48) 2999th December, 1948CABINETRECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CIVIL WAR IN china memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate to my colleagues herewith a paper regarding developments in theChinese civil war.This paper is designed to show the implications on British policy and interests in the Far East of a Communist domination of China. The presentposition in China is that the Communists already virtually control North Chinaand it is merely a matter of time before this control is extended. The result mayeither be the disappearance of Chiang Kai-shek and the creation of a coalitiondominated by the Communists, or an attempt by Chiang Kai-shek to keep hisgovernment in being in some part of China, which would result in a continuanceof civil war. It is assumed that in either event Communist domination of Chinawill only be a matter of time. It is also assumed that the Chinese Communists,if ever they succeed in surmounting their economic difficulties, will adopt the policies of orthodox Communism.The only Power which could contribute financial, material and military resources for counter action against the Chinese Communists in China is theUnited States, but it seems unlikely that such counter action will be taken or, iftaken, will be effective.The political effects of this state of affairs on neighbouring countries areseparately considered. The general conclusion is that Communist activities inall these countries will be increased and that contacts between Communists inthese countries will be facilitated. The economic effects in these areas are likelyto be an increase in labour troubles and disturbances in the production of vitalcommodities.In China it can be assumed (i) that there will be an immediate period of dislocation when foreigncommerce generally will be at a low ebb;(ii) that there will follow a period in which the economic difficulties of the communists may dispose them to be tolerant towards foreign trading interests;(iii) that the present nationalist tendency towards foreign investments and capital installations will thereafter be enhanced and that the intentionto work rapidly towards the exclusion of the foreigner will be strengthened;(iv) that there would be a tendency to subject foreign trade, both import and export, to close government control, which would not altogether suitthe types of trade United Kingdom merchants aim at doing in andwith China.But British interests in China might be able to carry on at least for a time andwe should encourage this.It is recommended (i) that we should consult Commonwealth countries, the United States,France, Netherlands, Burma and Siam as to the best means of con-taining the Communist threat to all our interests;36272 b
(ii) that all necessary steps should be taken to strengthen our own positionin Colonial territories in the area; and(iii) that we should consider in consultation with friendly Powers whetherthe economic weakness of Communist-dominated China might not offeran opportunity to secure reasonable treatment for our interests,E. B.Foreign Office, S. W. 1,9th December, 1948.
3167ANNEXCHINAI.-POLITICAL APPRECIATIONThe Government of the Republic of China under President Chiang Kai-shekhas virtually lost control of the whole area north of the River Yangtze as the direct result of military failures in Manchuria. Moreover, it seems highlyunlikely that the Government forces, whose fighting value is at best problematical,will be able to hold their ground on the south bank of the river m the face ofdetermined pressure from the Communists. The northern Communist armiesnow hold the initiative and are making an all-out drive on Nanking with intent to dislodge the Central Government from its capital. The consensus of expertopinion is that success is merely a matter of time.2. Following on the Communist occupation of the whole area north of theYangtze the political situation is likely to take one of two courses : (a) The disappearance from the scene of Chiang Kai-shek, when the Govern-ment, headed by Vice-President Li Tsung-jen and with the support ofcertain military leaders, may try for a military truce and a subsequentpolitical arrangement by negotiation with the Communists. As thelatter hold the whip hand it is likely to rest with them whether such proposals are accepted or not.(&amp;) The withdrawal of Chiang Kai-shek and a small number of his henchmento Canton or elsewhere in China proper in a die-hard attempt tocontinue the war. Although this is compatible with Chiang Kai-shek&apos;present mood and would suit those members of the Kuomintang whosefate is linked with his, it is doubtful whether the essential quota ofGovernment servants would be able or willing to follow. In any eventhe and his associates are now so completely discredited in. the eyes of the people that their continued existence as a shadow Governmentwould be entirely dependent on American support, which would haveto be much more extensive than anything so far undertaken. a withdrawal by Chiang Kai-shek to Formosa would hardly affect thecourse of events on the mainland.3. Of the above alternatives the first is likely to be the more welcome tothe Communists, since it would give them control over Nanking and Shanghaiwithout driving away the administration and financial elements, which they would find it difficult to replace from their own resources. Further, if they attach importance to the international position they would thus step overnight into the controlling position in a recognised government. To the extent that they areguided by Moscow they may be encouraged to pursue this policy with a viewto strengthening the opposition to the Western Democracies in the United Nations.4. Much has been written which suggests that the Chinese Communists areCommunists only in name. Justification for this view lies in the fact that up tothe present there has. been no need for Moscow to take any overt hand in the civil war or for the Chinese Communists to make any appeal to their compatriots savethat of relative honesty, relative efficiency, an ostensibly fair deal in the matterof land reform and above all peace. On the other hand, a careful study of their official pronouncements shows that their leader, General Mao Tse-tung, pays atany rate whole-hearted lip service to the Marxist-Leninist philosophy, while the moscow press has avoided comment on his successes with such scruple over solong a period as to suggest that it is in the interests of Soviet policy not to trouble the pipe dreams of the complacent. Inasmuch as the Communistaohninistration appears to be better disciplined and less corrupt that that ofthe Central Government, it may well be that if it is their policy to develop andexploit Chinese resources their initial attitude to foreign technical ability and trading interests may be encouraging. It would, however, be highly dangerous to assume that this initial honeymoon period would be likely to ripen into anvenduring bond.36272
5. It is nevertheless clear that, by whichever means the Communists acquirecontrol of the area south of the Yangtze, they must inherit the economic ills ofthe land. If they do so by entering a coalition Government the drain on theexchequer from civil war would cease, but it may be assumed that the CentralGovernment has already reached such a degree of insolvency that the advantageof this is likely to be more apparent than real. In our present&apos; ignorance of communist internal policies it is impossible to measure the degree of handicapwhich this state of affairs will represent, but its existence can hardly fail to induce the Kuomintang&apos;s successors to seek to maintain the country&apos;s exporttrade in order to pay for her essential imports, and in this connexion some initialbenefit to British traders may accrue. Moreover, it is also fair to assume thatGeneral Mao Tse-tung will be hard put to it to provide the necessary administra-tion, the more so as the number of his efficient followers is probably limited andwill become somewhat thin on the ground when the whole of China falls to be administered. This factor, too, may well tend to shelter British interests forsome time from the full force and fury of Communist theory and practice. but of the ultimate intentions of Mao Tse-tung, if he succeeds in surmounting localdifficulties, there is little doubt.6. In either event the Communists would almost certainly require a fairlylengthy period of preparation and infiltration before moving very far south ofthe Yangtze. Even in the absence of any coherent opposition, therefore, the eventual Communist domination of the whole of China is likely to take some little time. Whether advantage can be taken of the breathing space to create an anti-Communist bloc (for which American aid would be essential) remains to be seen, but as already indicated, the prospects are very doubtful.II-AMERICAN POLICY  TOWARDS  CHINA7. The United States Government have been under considerable pressure from the Chinese to increase their military aid to the Nationalist forces and toissue some firm statement in support of the Central Governmenfs cause.President Chiang Kai-shek has appealed to Mr. Truman not only for suppliesbut for the appointment of a pre-eminent American military figure as SupremeAdviser to the Chinese forces who would in fact be a Supreme Commander,and that the personnel of the existing Military Mission should be spread overChinese divisions, again as Advisers but in fact as Divisional Commanders. Onthe political side they have been asked to canvass support for Chiang Kai-shekamong small political parties in China. Mr. Marshall has explained that it is his Governmenfs intention to refuse these hysterical requests but at the sametime to continue to support Chiang Kai-shek so long as he is supportable byhastening deliveries of such supplies as the Americans have contracted to make available under the grant for aid to China already voted by Congress. MadameChiang&apos;s visit to the United States to canvass her husband&apos;s cause thus representsno mean embarrassment to United States authorities.8. It is noteworthy that the United States Ambassador to China, who has long been a staunch advocate to giving the fullest aid to the Central Government,has now reached the conclusion that it is too late for such a policy to be effective.We may thus assume that Washington will stand by their present policy of limitedcommitments on Chiang Kai-sb.ek&apos;s behalf. The State Department are, however,in a dilemma, since if they were to issue some statement calculated to assistChiang Kai-shek, they would be concealing the true facts from the american public and being dishonest with Congress. If, on the other hand, the state department revealed the true facts to the American public, they would, in Mr.Lovetfs words, &quot; pull the rug out from under Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s feet.&quot; To a lesser extent this same dilemma must condition any references to the Chinesesituation which His Majesty&apos;s Government may feel obliged to make inParliament.III.-POLITICAL EFFECTS ON ADJACENT AREAS(a) Japan9. The spread of Communism in China will enhance the political and strategic importance of Japan as the most important non-Communist area in east Asia, and seems certain to strengthen the determination of the United StatesGovernment that Japan shall not fall under Communist domination.   United
States policy towards Japan is largely, determined by strategic considerationsarising out of the tension in Soviet-American relations. The Americans no longerappear to regard Japan as a potential threat to security, but as a potential helpin the case of war with the Soviet Union. This trend in American policy is beingscrutinised very carefully by certain Commonwealth countries, notably Australiaand New Zealand, who would consider that their security was threatened bythe restoration of Japan, unless it were kept under strict Allied control. Forthis reason, besides its more direct effects on the United Kingdom&apos;s own interests,the United Kingdom must also watch it carefully. It is, moreover, a trend which seems certain to be strengthened if China becomes lost, wholly or in part, to the democratic world. The Americans are likely to become more determined than ever to ensure that the Japanese standard of living is maintained at a level highenough to give the Japanese worker no incentive to turn to extreme politicalcourses; and their conviction that it would be unwise to conclude a Treaty ofPeace in present circumstances and that the military occupation of Japan mustbe continued for an indefinite period will be strengthened.(b) Hong Kong10. Communist domination of China down to the Yangtze is not in thefirst instance likely to affect Hong Kong very seriously. The colony&apos;s major problem is likely to be a steady stream of refugees. If, as may be expected, the communists continue southward, they may well try to &quot;soften up &quot; Hong Kongby instigating strikes to coincide with their advance. Since labour in public utilities and on the waterfront in Hong Kong is mainly Communist in sympathy,such strikes might temporarily paralyse the colony. Serious clashes betweenCommunist and Kuomintang supporters might also occur.11. If all China were dominated by the Communists, the retention of HongKong as a British colony, in the absence of strong, British naval and militaryforces, might depend on whether the Communists found the existence of a well-organised, well-run British port convenient for their trade with the outside world.In that event, while Hong Kong might be faced with a vast refugee problem, thecolony could continue its life, but would be living on the edge of a volcano. Mean-while the Communists would no doubt continue their infiltration tactics. If,on the other hand, the Communists were to demand the rendition of Hong Kongto China, they would use every method short of war to undermine it.(c) The Federation of Malaya and Singapore12. Communist control of China down to the Yangtze would not have suchserious effects on Malaya as Communist domination of the whole of China, be-cause most of the Malayan Chinese come from South China and because theCommunist-controlled areas would not be contiguous to the frontier of FrenchIndo-China. The following reactions among Malayan Chinese during such aperiod could, however, be expected, while some of the effects forecast in paragraph13 below would also be felt (i) an intensification of Kuomintang activity. An increase in Kuomintangactivity has already been reported in recent weeks (including paperplans for an underground cell system;(ii) strong support for the China Democratic League and the KuomintangRevolutionary Committee, which would increase if a coalition Govern-ment were formed in China;(iii) increased political activity by the Chinese community, with agitationfor increased representation of the Chinese in the Federal or StateCouncils, to which the Malays would react strongly.13. Communist control of the whole of China would be a grave danger to malaya and would mean that: (i) Militant communism would be very close to Malaya&apos;s northern frontier,with Siam and French Indo-China as poor buffers;(ii) the morale of the Malayan Communists would be bound to improve;(iii) there might very well be increased activity by China Communist Partyagents infiltrating into Malaya. A number of China Communist Partyagents are already reported to have reached Singapore;
(iv) a comparatively small increase in the successes of the Malayan Com-munists might have wide repercussions among the passive Chinesecommunity, since Chinese morale as a whole in Malaya has never been good, and is very sensistive to bandit successes, intimidation, and propaganda;(v) the Chinese population in general might well be even less ready toco-operate actively with the Malayan Government than at present.They will continue to sit firmly on the fence and hope that a Com-munist administration in China will turn out to be peaceful andreformist;(vi) subversive activities by Kuomintang diehards might well continue,though admittedly without the backing of the Chinese Government,which it has hitherto enjoyed to the detriment of good governmentin Malaya;(vii) there would be some increase in illegal immigration into Malaya andthere might also be a demand for asylum for political refugees;(viii) there would be repercussions among the Malays to any increase inChinese political activity and also if militant communism were to spread in Indonesia.(d) Sarawak and North Borneo14. In Sarawak and North Borneo it is expected that Communist successesin North China will probably lead to an increase in Communist sympathies amongthe local Chinese population and reinforcement of present Communist attempts to persuade Chinese intelligentsia that national aspirations can now best beachieved through communism. At the same time a parallel increase in Kuomin-tang activity may be expected in the form of tightening control over registeredsocieties, and increasing pressure on the Communists.(e) Foreign Territories in South-East Asia15. In general, it may be expected that Communist successes in China willstimulate Communist movements throughout the area. If the Chinese Com-munists succeed in overrunning the whole Of China, the possibilities of contacts with the Communists in Indo-China, Si am and Burma will be greatly facilitated,and it may be expected that Communist agitation in various forms will be accelerated to a marked degree.16. Burma. The frontier between Burma and China is in part undefined,and in view of the fact that the present Burmese Government lacks effective control, it would be difficult to prevent the infiltration of Chinese communists and a link-up between them and Burmese Communists against the Governmentwere the whole of South-West China to come under Chinese Communist control.The general disorder in Burma might render it very difficult to cope with any considerable increase in Communist strength. There might also be the two furtherdangers of communism seeping over the border into India and Pakistan (EastBengal), and of the Chinese Communists pressing China&apos;s extensive frontierclaims against Burma.17. Indo-China. -Direct contact between Communist-controlled China andNorthern Indo-China will greatly increase the difficulties of the situation in thelatter territory, where the failure of the French Government to take effective measures to seek a solution has resulted in an alliance between the Nationalistand Communist elements. The French forces in Indo-China are already stretched,and if the Viet Minh were to be strongly reinforced as a result of a Communist-controlled China, the situation might well become untenable for the French, at anyrate in the north. There would be an increased threat to South-East Asia ingeneral through the strengthening of the Communist position in Indo-China.18. Indonesia. Apart from the psychological effect of a total Communistvictory in China upon Communists in Indonesia, it is doubtful whether any very early reactions would manifest themselves in view of the defeat administered tothe Communists in their recent attempt to wrest power from the Republic. Butif the Dutch were to fail to reach a settlement in the near future and were to take military action against the Republic, this might lead to an alliance between the nationalists and the Communists which might result in a long period of disorderwith serious consequences not only to Indonesia but to South-East Asia as a whole.. 19- Siam. There is quite a strong Chinese Communist element in Siamwhich so far has not caused serious trouble, but encouraged by the situation in
7169China it might well get out of hand, and. it is by no means certain that the com-paratively inefficient administration in Siam would be able to deal with iteffectively. There is a considerable danger that if the Communists got outof control in southern Siam, they might combine with Communist elements in malaya, thus rendering the suppression of the latter immeasurably more difficult.20. Sinkiang and Tibet. Chinese Communist control in Sinkiang would facilitate increased Russian pressure, which is already apparent in that region.It is just conceivable, however, that if the Russians sought complete dominationin Sinkiang, this might cause a rift with the Chinese Communists, whosenationalism would not take kindly to Russian acquisitiveness. In Tibet, it is not likely that the Tibetans would welcome Chinese Communists any more than theywelcome attempts at domination by the National Government of China. Butobviously the potential danger is greater as the area to the north and east of Tibetcomes under Communist domination.(/) India and Pakistan .21. The political consequences to India and Pakistan of Communist domina-tion of China would be indirect but none the less formidable. They would bemoderated or delayed to the extent that Communist domination did not spreadover the whole of China. They would consist in the first instance of the greatmoral effect of China becoming a Communist State. India, and to a lesser extentPakistan, are the field where Western and Asian civilisations meet, and there is always a tension between them. Hitherto, Russia has been a third factor; but theadoption of communism by a major Asiatic country would be likely to cause it tobe regarded in India and Pakistan more favourably than when it was pre-dominantly a northern and western development. Although China has no common frontier with India, a Communist-dominated China would certainly result in a strengthening of communism in Burma, and the countries to the north of India Tibet, Nepal and Bhutan would gradually be penetrated by communist influence. Thus there would at once be a threat of political and strategicencirclement of India and Pakistani land frontiers by Communist states, whichmight in a relatively short time become a reality.22. The political consequences of this situation may be summarised asfollows : 1(i) The Indian Communists would derive enhanced prestige and greaterinfluence. At present they are a small but vigorous minority. Theywould be fortified by the infiltration of Communist agents and communist finance through Burma, Eastern Pakistan, and throughNorth-West Pakistan,(ii) The Indian Communists would redouble their efforts to acquire influence over organised labour. They already have an influential trade union organisation under their effective domination. The agricultural population is illiterate and politically inert and therefore the urbanpopulation of India, which is small, has an influence out of all proportion to its size.(iii) Any economic disaster, such as a famine, would give communism anopportunity to-spread to rural areas.(iv) The present attitude of neutrality on the part of India in foreignpolicy as between the Communist States and the Western democraciesmight harden as Communists rises to power in Asia. On the otherhand, Hinduism is strongly opposed to communism in outlook andinitially at any rate the Nehru Government would be likely to makea determined stand against communism, their ability to maintainit depending on their ability to provide progressive improvement ofthe economic condition of the masses,(v) Burmese rice might be diverted away from India if Burma wentCommunist and joined in any attempt to overthrow the existingregime in India. This would be a powerful factor militating against an improvement in India&apos;s economic condition,(vi) The Government of Pakistan would be likely to be strongly anti-Com-munist if their disputes with India, particularly over Kashmir, were disposed of. Until that happens, however, there is a possibility thatPakistan might prefer Russian support against India, even with someknowledge of Russia&apos;s price, to absorption or conquest by India,36272 e
which she still regards as India&apos;s primary objective. A solution ofthe Kashmir dispute would therefore become even more essential from our point of view if the Chinese Communists succeed in controllingChina.IV. ECONOMIC EFFECTS23. The main economic effects of a Chinese Communist advance depend again on whether the advance is stopped at the Yangtze or continues over South China.The main fields in which our economic interests might be affected (depending onthe extent of the advance) would be (a) British Commercial property and investments in China;(b) China-United Kingdom trade;(c) Shipping;(d) The economy of Hong Kong;(e) The economy of South-East Asia;(/) Overseas Chinese remittances.24. In general it might be assumed that, wherever the Communists might get to, there would be an initial period before any stable administration could getgoing there/when foreign commerce and business generally would be at a lowebb. This could not, however, be a very much worse state of affairs than that existing in China at present, with the lack of easy and safe internal communica-tions, extremely inflated prices, the restrictive attitude of the present national government towards foreign trade, shipping and business, and the prevalentcorruption. During this period the economies of Hong Kong and South-EastAsian countries generally would probably be affected mainly (and in the case of hong Kong, seriously) by labour disturbances and refugees, but only to any great extent if the advance continued beyond the Yangtze. There is, too, a possibility that the Communists might decide to by-pass Shanghai, isolating it from its hinter-land. In this event the city would be faced with starvation, and not only would the danger to British life and property be increased, but we and the americans would be under considerable pressure to supply it by sea.- 25. In the longer term much depends on the attitude the Communists adopt towards foreign commercial and shipping interests, and towards Hong Kong as aforeign enclave on the one hand and as a well-run and well-organised entrepot onthe other hand. If one assumes a period of Communist opportunist policy, foreign trade and business with and in the Communist-dominated area will probably notvary greatly in quantity but should at least be less precarious unless and until the threat of expropriation begins to he felt. Undoubtedly the maintenance orcreation of a balance of visible trade using existing facilities (Hong Kong entrepot,foreign shipping, foreign-owned insurance and commercial houses) would be a vitalprop to a new Government, at least until it felt in a position to provide the facili-ties itself. And any Chinese Government would have to maintain facilities toprovide for essential imports (rice, raw materials, &amp;c.) which in 1936, a goodyear, amounted to 17 per cent, of her imports. As against this, however, it mustbe assumed that a general tightening up of controls would occur with resultantrestrictions on remittances and on the possibility of the general range of british goods gaining an established position in the potentially vast Chinese market.r... 26. The final stage of expropriation or expulsion of foreign commercial and shipping interests and investments, and the undermining of Hong Kong&apos;s economic prosperity, may not materialise for some time in view of the extent and essentialnatinre of these interests Compared for instance with those in Eastern european countries. But the combination of Chinese Nationalist and Communist feelingsmay well precipitate this event which, if Shanghai and South China were over-run, would involve a considerable loss to British commercial interests in Shanghai,to British shipping firms operating on coastal trade in South China, and, above all,to the present prosperous economy of Hong Kong.27. A more detailed consideration of these possible economic effects is given under the several heads below. :i -(a) British commercial property and investments^ . 28.. The whole situation is laden with &quot; ifs,&quot; but under the present regimeBritish interests are in a bad way and little return is being received from existing
investments. Up to date there has always been a hope of improved conditions,which is not likely to materialise under a Communist regime.29. The total value of British commercial property and investments in china was assessed in 1941 at  300 million of which about one-third is situated in shanghai. The true figure for the present time cannot be accurately estimated.(b) China United Kingdom trade30. United Kingdom trade with China is at a comparatively low level atpresent due to the innumerable difficulties mentioned above. Our main interestlies in increasing exports from China, and in the long run to get a foothold inthe potentially great Chinese market.(i) Chinese visible imports from Sterling A rea31. United &quot;Kingdom exports to China, which amounted in 1947 to nearly 13 million, will probably be slightly less in 1948. About 50 per cent, consists ofbanknotes, textile machinery, other machinery, electrical goods and iron and steelmanufactures; the remaining 50 per cent, consists of wool tops and miscellaneousgoods. Most of this trade passes through Shanghai, and imports of machinery and similar goods from the United Kingdom remain in Shanghai or in other industrial centres, which are mostly north of the Yangtze. Domination of Chinadown to the Yangtze by a Communist Government would therefore be littledifferent in effect from domination of all China by such a Government.32. Conditions in China have lately been very unfavourable and currenttrade is neither healthy nor stable. On a long-term view we should certainlywant to maintain a foothold in what is potentially one of the greatest markets inthe world. A Communist administration would, however, probably restrict importseven more closely than is being done at present by the Central Government tostrictly essential goods, especially machinery and capital goods. We should be reluctant to give the Chinese market high priority for the scarcer capital goodsor to quote early delivery dates, (both of which would probably be demanded)since we do not control our export trade in this way and the volume and im-portance of Chinese exports to us would not justify it.33. It is worth noting that even in bad years rice and other food-stuffs andraw materials form a high proportion of China&apos;s essential imports and much ofthis comes from the Sterling Area.(ii) United Kingdom visible imports from China34. United Kingdom imports from China, which amounted in 1947 to about 7 million, will probably be more in 1948. They consist chiefly of bristles (animportant raw material, and China is the main source of supply), vegetable seeds&amp;c, dairy produce (mainly eggs), tung oil and tea. Given financial and political stability and improved transport China could contribute far more than thisinsignificant amount to our requirements of agricultural produce and rawmaterials, but she could scarcely become a major source of supply for basiccommodities. Most of this trade passes through Shanghai, and many of the areas from which the imports are drawn lie to the North of the Yangtze (the two chiefexceptions being the southern province of Kwangtung and the island of Formosa).The effect of domination of China down to the Yangtze by a Communist govern-ment would therefore differ only in degree from that of domination of all Chinaby such a government.35. Unless it is prepared to face widespread suffering and discontent, anyChinese Government must foster at least enough foreign, trade to pay for essential imports, of which rice, food-stuffs and raw materials form a high percentage.This-need for essential imports would mean that a Communist administration would be under stronger pressure that the Nationalist Government to take activesteps to increase the volume of exports, since it would probably be without anycredits from foreign countries, and unable to draw upon such resources as the sterling credits acquired in this country by Chinese industrialists and financiersduring the war, which have paid for a proportion of the capital goods sent toUnina-m the last three years. We might therefore be in a better bargaining&apos;position than in present circumstances to obtain the sort of commodities we wantirom bfima, but, as stated above, the Chinese would undoubtedly, want scarce andnign priority goods in return.   &apos; - &quot;36272
36. The general conclusion, therefore, is that (after a temporary dislocation of perhaps several months) trade between the sterling area and China would notcease under Communist domination. Its maintenance would, however, presentnew difficulties. If these could be overcome a stable Communist administration should be able to do more than the present regime to provide commodities valuableto us in payment for United Kingdom exports.(c) Shipping37. There is as yet no indication of what Communist policy towards foreignshipping will be. Independence of foreign vessels and the closing of the Yangtzeto foreign shipping have long been objectives of Chinese nationalist feeling, butthe Communists will certainly need shipping for coastal and river traffic, and theirpolicy may well be determined by the amount of the present Chinese merchanttonnage which falls into their hands. British shipowners in the China trade areprepared to trade wherever trade offers.(i) Coastal shipping between China, Hong Kong and South-East Asia38.   If the Communists allow British vessels to trade at Chinese ports under their control Communist domination of China down to the Yangtze would prob-ably benefit British coastal trade by reintegrating the North China ports withtheir economic hinterland and Communist domination of all China would probably not affect trading on the South China coast.39. If the Communists do not allow British coastal vessels to trade atChinese ports under their control Communist domination of China down to theYangtze would be little worse than conditions prevailing until recently, as therehas for some time been little profit in the North China coastal trade, but Com-munist domination of all China would mean very serious losses to British shippingfirms, whose trade is now largely based on the South China coast. It would alsobe a grave blow to Hong Kong, whose shipping prosperity is bound up with the china trade.40. It is impossible to assess how much of the existing Chinese flag coastaltonnage, which now has the monopoly of the coastal trade and amounts to somehalf million tons gross, will become available to the Communists.(ii) Ocean shipping41. The ocean companies are concerned chiefly with Shanghai. Oceanshipping would not be affected if the Communists allowed foreign flag vessels totrade there, but would cease if they did not. If the Communists capturedShanghai&apos;s hinterland but not Shanghai itself ocean companies would probablycontinue their present trade in an attenuated form.42. The extent of Chinese overseas tonnage is negligible. Therefore, ifthe Communists were obliged by economic necessity to use overseas vessels, Britishtonnage should obtain a share.(iii) River shipping43. The Yangtze, which is navigable by ocean going vessels and is China&apos;main waterway, is at present closed to foreign shipping. If it and Shanghaiwere opened by the Communists British coastal and ocean companies would bebetter off than at present.(iv) Assets of British shipping firms in China44. The shipping firms trading in China and those trading with China, aswell as the oil companies, all have extensive shore properties in every port andin addition they own harbour craft such as the tugs and lighters in Tientsin,practically the whole of the dock and repair facilities in Shanghai and a con-siderable proportion of the harbour craft there as well. The value of these pro-perties was valued in 1941 at  18 million.(d) The economy of Hong Kong45. Subject to what has been said in paragraphs 24, 25, 26 and 39 above,Communist domination of China down to the Yangtze would probably not affectHong Kong&apos;s economic position if a strong resistance line could be formed at theYangtze; it might even be benefited, more especially if the use of Shanghai as a
port became more difficult and increased imports of essential food, petrol, oil, &amp;c,for China were to be diverted, in whole or in part, through Hong Kong.46. If the Communists dominated all China, they might provisionally wishfor their own purposes to keep Hong Kong as a going concern in British hands.They might, however, take ruthless steps to acquire all Hong Kong dollar notesheld in South China; this could only be partly successful unless the Chineseeconomy were prosperous and the Hong Kong dollar definitely on the decline there would be no inducement to surrender Hong Kong dollars voluntarily exceptfor a stronger currency. Hong Kong notes requisitioned by the communist government might be used indirectly to obtain sterling credits for purchases forthe Chinese Communists or for the U.S.S.E. Shares of Hong Kong publicutility and dockyard Companies would probably fall substantially, but it isconsidered unlikely that there would be any actual flight of British capital. Ifthe Communists chose to carry on a cold war against Hong Kong on the economicfront, they might be able, temporarily at any rate, to paralyse the economic life of the Colony by fomenting strikes. Rumours spread by them in Hong Kongthat there was no backing for the Hong Kong dollar might also cause great difficulties; but Chinese exports would no doubt be smuggled into Hong Kong insubstantial quantities despite Communist efforts to route them elsewhere.(e) Economy of South-East Asia47. The most serious economic effects of a Communist-controlled China arelikely to be (i) the probable increase in Communist-inspired labour disturbances inSouth-East Asia;(ii) a serious refugee problem, particularly in Hong Kong, whose food re-sources will consequently be strained to the utmost;(iii) further disturbances in the rice-producing countries (Burma, Siam,Indo-China) leading to a decrease in the production of rice, on whichwe, India, and Ceylon rely to feed the increasing populations of our respective territories. Already rice production is lagging well behindpre-war and any decreases in the present inadequate production willhave the greatest repercussions on our colonial territories and on the asian Commonwealth countries. A decrease in rice consumption willprovide fertile ground for Communist agitation. This together withgeneral disturbances in other South-East Asia industries would causefurther disruption of the economy of the area with consequent adverse effects on the production of such vital commodities as rubber, tin, edibleoils, &amp;c, which are of such importance to world economic recovery.(/) Overseas Chinese remittances48. It is not expected that after perhaps a temporary interlude Chineseliving abroad will wish to discontinue family remittances to a Communist China.Patriotic funds to help the nationalist cause would of course cease, but by far the greater proportion of foreign remittances are family remittances largely to south China. It may be estimated that at present about half these pass throughHong Kong, where they are converted into Hong Kong dollars or Chinese currencyfor use in China. Hong Kong&apos;s valuable foreign exchange earnings from this traffic will possibly be increased rather than reduced while conditions remain un-settled in China. The risk of attempts at diversion by a strong Chinese Govern -ment remain the same, Communist or Kuomintang.V.-POSSIBILITIES OF COUNTER-ACTION49. Certain measures for the emergency evacuation of British residentsin China have already been taken. The Commanders-in-Chief, Far East, have for some time been considering the military aspects of the problem in relationto Hong Kong and South-East Asia. Action oh the civil side is being takento put Hong Kong into as great a state of preparedness as possible. The Chiefsof Staff have been invited to consider the strategic implications of the Chinasituation in so far as it threatens the colony of Hong Kong. It is, however,desirable to consider what further measures are open to us to safeguard Britishinterests in the Far East.
China50. The only Power which could contribute financial, material or military resources for counter-action against the Chinese Communists in China is theUnited States. For reasons already stated, it seems unlikely that such counter-action will be taken, or if it were taken that it would be effective. As far asthe United Kingdom is concerned, our best hope probably lies in keeping a footin the door. That is to say that, provided there is not actual danger to life,we should endeavour to stay where we are, to have de facto relations with theChinese Communists in so far as these are unavoidable, and to investigate thepossibilities of continued trade in China. It may be that, in consultation withour friends, we shall have a bargaining counter by virtue of our being ableto withhold certain essential imports which China must have if the chinese communists do not behave. We might be able to insist as a quid pro quo thatthe Communists should respect our trading position and our properties in China.This will require further examination, but seems to offer the only possibilityof counter-action in the immediate future. If the Chinese Communist adminis-tration fails to obtain effective control of the country, it may be possible to takeadvantage of internal strains as they manifest themselves to maintain and even to improve our position. In order to do this it is essential that we should not abandon our position in China, and we must aim to keep, at any rate, a foot-in the door.South-East Asia51. The Americans are apparently not prepared to accept any responsibilityfor South-East Asia, or to take any action at present to maintain the positionof friendly Powers there. It therefore seems that it will fall to the Powersgeographically situated in the region to take their own measures to meet theCommunist menace. It is more than ever essential that the most strenuous efforts should be made to clear up the situation in Malaya as soon as possible. Thoughit is very desirable that the measures taken by the Governments in the area shouldbe co-ordinated, it is very doubtful whether in the present political situationin the region it would be possible to align the various territories publiclytogether. Burma, for example, would find difficulty in associating with FrenchIndo-China and Indonesia, while the French and the Dutch might be equallyreluctant to have such an association. Moreover, the Commonwealth countriesprimarily concerned, i.e., Australia, New Zealand, India and Pakistan, whichall have a vital interest in the peace and prosperity of South-East Asia, would,on present showing be unwilling to join in any activities involving supportof the French and Dutch Governments in this area. It may, therefore, be thatthe United Kingdom is in the best position to act as the co-ordinating factor,though it would be necessary to consider the political consequences very carefullyat each stage.52. In these circumstances there might be advantage in our addressingourselves to all the interested Powers, setting forth our view of the problemslikely to arise as a result of Communist successes in China, and consulting withthe Powers concerned as to the best method of dealing with the situation. Suchcommunications might be addressed to the Commonwealth countries, to France,the Netherlands, Burma and Siam. The United States should be kept informed and their support sought. It is desirable, so far as political considerationspermit, to ensure that each territory was possessed of police and intelligenceservices, as well as the requisite legal powers, to deal adequately with any growth of Communist activity, and with these measures in view to arrange for an exchangeof information (always provided that this is without risk to our own security)and for frequent consultation. The possibilities of doing this would be considered on receiving the answers to our communications to the various Governments.We might also invite a study of the economic consequences of Communistdomination of China for the whole area.53.   In addition to the studies of the military aspects of the problemmentioned in paragraph 49 above, the Chiefs of Staff have been asked to considerthe military implications of the situation and the possibility of co-ordinating  jmilitary measures within the Afghanistan to the Pacific region to meet with any possible strategic threat.
