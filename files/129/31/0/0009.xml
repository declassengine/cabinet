felS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT)f       SECRETCP. (48)  27923RD NOVEMBER, 194-housing bill memorandum by the Lord Privy seal i venture to submit a note on the memorandum on theHousing Bill (CP.(48) 275),  submitted by the Minister of health on 18th November,  on the ground of my active share in promoting a Labour Party agricultural policy, as well as my previous experience as Minister of Agriculture.2. I sincerely hope that the Minister will be willingto modify the proposals&apos; set out in the paper.3&quot; As I understand it,  the effect would be that nogrants would be available for the improvement of cottagesinhabited by agricultural workers where they fall into either of the classes mentioned in paragraph 2(i) and (ii) of his paper, while   they would be available to cottages occupied byother people in the same village or by agricultural workers inother cottages.    I have known a great many cases in which,cottages in villages go with farms, while adjoining cottagesof the same type are let to other tenants.   The result ofwhat is proposed might therefore be that the owner who lets acottage to a week-ender would be eligible for a grant, while he would not be allowed to receive any assistance if thecottage appertaining to a farm was occupied by a farm labourer.I find it difficult to understand the reason for thisdiscrimination.4* It is true that farmers are,  or ought to be,  doing-very well under existing conditions, but surely that is noreason why the wife of an agricultural labourer should not have as good an opportunity of getting an improved cottage as other people.    If we were to place agricultural workers in this wayat a disadvantage as compared with the occupants of othercottages in the same village it v^ould have an absolutelydesolating effect upon our agricultural policy in country districts.    I really cannot see on what grounds we could defendit.5. We could,  of course take care that the cottagescontinued to be let to agricultural workers and adequate safe-?uards could be provided through the Ministry of Agricultureprobably by means of the Tribunal associated with theAgricultural Executive Committees) and conditions to that effect could be provided for in the grants.6. I myself was a Chairman during the war years of a tribunal to which applications were made for certificates fromthe County Agricultural Committees, and I know from first-COPY NO.3\CABINET
hand experience how badly many cottages need improvement and what real hardship would be occasioned if the improvementof these cottages were to be estopped by the discrimination against them which would inevitably result from the procedureindicated in the Minister of Health&apos;s paper.A.Office of the Lord Privy Seal, s*W*l.,23r*d November, 191+8.
