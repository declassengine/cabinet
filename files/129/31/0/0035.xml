IIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (48)  .305 COPY NO. J 1.20TH DECEMBER,  19h8CABINETCENSUS  OF DISTRIBUTIONMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI attach a memorandum prepared in the Board ofTrade which sets out some of the considerations affectingthe choice of the year in which the first Census of distribution should be taken.   I have been invited &quot;by theProduction Committee  (P.C.(h.3) 25th Mooting, Llinuto 2) to submitthis matter to tho Cabinet because of the importance of thepolitical issues involved.2* As the memorandum explains, plans have been laidto take the Census, which will provide important and urgently-needed information, in 1950,  and an Order has been laidempowering this to be done.    The taking of such a Census was unanimously recommended by a Committee appointed in 19^5by Mr. Oliver Lyttelton,  then President of the Board of Trade;and during the passage of the Statistics of Trade Bill,  theOpposition did not oppose the idea of taking a Census of distribution. &apos; My colleagues should however be aware of theburden on shopkeepers arising from the Census, and they maylike to weigh the arguments for and against proceedingaccording to our present time-table,  or postponing it forone or two years.3. As the memorandum indicates, postponment for one year will create certain administrative difficulties and could have little effect in stilling political opposition during 1950, aspreliminary forms giving notice of the questions to be askedwill be circulated in the first weeks of 1950-     The resultsof the Census will be delayed until 1952,  so that there willbe little time to make use of the information during the life-time of the next Parliament.     Opponents of the census areasking for postponement because of the alleged tradingabnormalities of the present;    it would be difficult toexplain a twelve-month postponement on the grounds that the census would then cover a more &quot;normal&quot; period.I4. Postponement for longer than a year is likely tohave the appearance of indefinite postpcnorncMfc, as an Orderfixing the date cannot well be laid in the present Parliament;this will certainly encourage opposition.     Real difficulties will follow from the absence of Census information.      It hasbeen agreed by the Lord President&apos;s Committee (L.P.(h7)  8thMeeting, Minute 2) that no general enquiry can be made intothe structure of distribution until the Census results oreavailable.      This was recently accepted by the PoodDistribution Committee (L.P.(h8) 1hth Meeting, Minute 1).
Useful action to improve efficiency in distribution must be preceded by careful consideration of the Census results,perhaps through the machinery of a Royal Commission.      If the census results are not available before 1953,  i&quot;t would clearly &quot;be impossible to formulate and present proposals tothe next Parliament.      It is doubtful whether action could he so long delayed.      The Trades Union Congress has pointed outthe possibility of reducing the cost of living by increasingthe efficiency of the distributive system.     The size and importance of the distributive trades9  employing over 2&amp;million people, make it certain that there will be continuedpressure to promote a reduction in costs and margins.Failing an early Census we may well find it necessary toestablish Working Parties to enquire into particular sectionsof the industry.5. Plans for a Census in 1950 give rise to staffrequirements which are to be met by the release of redundantstaff of the Ministry of Pensions in Cheltenham.     Detailedoffice accommodation and other plans have been prepared forthe work now undertaken by the Ministry of pensions atCheltenham to be transferred to Blackpool in easy stages,beginning in December, 1948, and ending in October,  1949*Certain blocks of that work have already been transferredand contracts have been placed by the Ministry of Works forfurther removals.      The staff employed by the Ministry ofPensions at Cheltenham number some 800 of whom about 600wore locally recruited.      In the normal course the transferof the work from Cheltenham to Blackpool wovald have resultedin a considerable measure of redundancy, but arrangements were made for such members of the staff as were not required at,  or were unwilling to move to, Blackpool, to be absorbed bythe Board of Trade, thus avoiding on the one hand, hardshipamongst the Minis try&apos;s staff and,&quot; on the other hand, providing a convenient pool from which the Board of Trade staff require-ments could, be met.      The Permanent Secretary of the Ministryof Pensions has had meetings at Blackpool and at Cheltenhamat which he has fully explained to the staff the arrange-ments contemplated.      The announcement was well received.The local authorities both at Cheltenham and Blackpool havealso been informed of the move and have been asked toco-operate in finding accommodation for transferred staff.Considerable publicity has inevitably been given to the move in the local press in both places.     Postponement -particularly for two years - will create embarrassment forthe Ministry of Pensions and make more difficult - perhaps -impossible - the movement of the Census office from London.6. For the above and other reasons, which I should like to call to the attention of my colleagues,  the question at issue is essentially one of timing - whether to take a census of Distribution in 1950 or to postpone tie inquiry fora year or more.H.W.Board of Trade, S.W.I.20TH DECEMBER,  1948.
Note by the Board of Tradef* f fi6d41.     In June 194-5 the President of the Board of Trade in the Caretaker Governmentappointed a committee to enquire into the desirability of taking a census andthat Committee, under the Chairmanship of Sir Richard Hopkins, after hearing evidence from a wide variety of interests including bodies representing the tradersconcerned, reported unanimously in favour of a periodic national census of the distributive and service trades, the first to be taken in 1949 covering theexperience of the trade in 1948.     The Lord President announced in the Houseof Commons in March 194-6 that the Government accepted the recommendations ofthe Committee, and these were embodied in the Statistics of Trade Bill whichwas presented to Parliament in December of that year and received the royal assent in July 194-7.2.     Arrangements had been made to take a preliminary pilot census as recommendedby the Committee in 194-7, but the fuel crisis in the spring of 1947 caused a postponement of this pilot enquiry until 1948 and a consequent postponement ofthe first national census -until 1950.     Accordingly, early this year traders in a selected group of towns and rural areas (with, about 5 per cent, of the populationof the country) were invited to co-operate with the Board by filling up a pilotcensus form.     In spite of the extensive national campaign organised by theNational Chamber of Trade, a sufficient response was received to provide a solidbasis of experience for drafting the forms for the national census.     an advisory Committee was then set up, in accordance with the provisions of the statistics of Trade Act, to help with the preparation of forms and instructions for the census.     The Committee considered the draft Order prescribing the year1950 as the year in which the census should be taken, covering information relating to 1949, and many members, including those with trade interests?expressed the definite view that the census should be taken in 1950 as planned -only one member asked for a postponement.     Accordingly the Order prescribing1950 as the year in which the census should be taken was laid on 24th Septemberof this year.     A Prayer against the Order was moved, by some members of theOpposition - largely at the instigation of the National Chamber of Trade -on the grounds that 1949 &quot;-ill be an abnormal year, and this was successfully resisted on 30th November-.3.     During the past few months the Advisory Committee has succeeded in draftingforms which have been circulated, for comment to trade associations who for themost part regard them as reasonable and not too difficult for traders to complete.4.     At every stage in the proposals for a census, from the meetings of theHopkins Committee in 1945 to the recent Prayer in the House, the National Chamberof Trade has agitated against the census.     Their main concern is to secure itsabandonment and any success, if only postponement for one year, will be claimedas evidence of what they can achieve for the small trader.     The National Chamberof Trade is, of course, only one of some 230 trade associations claiming torepresent the retailers and wholesalers of this country and few of these otherassociations are raising any objection to 1949 as the censal year;    some of them,indeed, welcome the project and look forward to getting useful results from it,while manufacturers of consumers&apos; goods are anxious to have the results for marketresearch purposes.     There is reason to believe that the National Chamber ofTrade Will continue their opposition as long as there is any chance of stoppingI the census.5.     Up to this point the arrangements have proceeded according to the planoriginally proposed by the Hopkins Committee, except for the postponement of ayear decided on in April 1947;    the present programme will see the circulationearly next year of specimen forms for the information of traders, and the actualissue of forms in January, 1950, for return in the early months of that year.As there will probably be a certain amount of opposition even to a compulsorycensus, the question arises whether it is desirable to take the Census in 1950or whether it should be postponed either for a year or longer.
6.     The intention to take the census in 1950 has been repeatedly affirmed sothat any postponement at this stage will be represented as a concession to the agitation originating from the National Chamber of Trade and will make it muchmore difficult to secure a good response from traders at a later date;    it might even lead to widespread, violation of the lav/.     A postponement of a year only,which would appear to be a direct result of the Prayer against 1950 on the grounds that the censal year   would be abnormal, would make it very difficult to find agood reason for taking the census in 195&quot;!.     Apart from this, if &quot;the oensusis postponed for a year, the circulation of specimen forms will occur early in1950 instead of 1949.7.     There is bound to be a considerable time lag between the year to which the census figures relate and the time when they are published.     It is planned to publish figures relating to 1949 towards the end of 1951.     Any delay beyond this date would have important repercussions in three directions:-(1)   Action to improve or investigations into the efficiency of the distributivesystem have up to now been postponed until the facts about this major industry could be revealed through a census.     It has been generally accepted that no adequate foundation of information existed, to support a decision either totake or refrain from action and the Jay Committee recently reaffirmed thisview.     It may not be easy to maintain this position if the results of a census recede until 1952 or later or if hopes of getting results die fromcontinued postponements.     It has for some time been suggested that whenthe census results are available, a Royal Commission might be set up to enquire into distribution;    if the Census is postponed and the results delayed until the end of 1952 or later, a Commission could hardly be expected toreport before 1954, and it might well be later.     In the meantime pressuremay necessitate the setting up of &quot;&quot;forking Parties to consider various sections of the distributive system in a piecemeal fashion and these&apos;.Wgrking Parties, lacking the necessary factual basis for their examinationof the distributive problems, would almost certainly launch their ownstatistical enquiries.(^)    National income and expenditure estimates arc at present derived as aresult of rationing, controls and purchase tax, the intention being touse the census as a more reliable and permanent basis as soon as the results are available.     If these are not ready before 1952 there will probably bea gap in the estimates at a time when these may be of vital importance,if the course of the economy is to be influenced by broadly fiscal methods,(3) Indices of current sales and stocks at the retail and wholesale levels areat present inadequate because there is not sufficient knowledge of the structure of these trades to institute indices based on a proper sampleof reporting firms.     The census is needed as a benchmark from which reliableindices can be built up;    as some time must elapse, however, after the census results are known before the new indices can be useful, a delay ofono or &quot; two years in taking the census would leave us without the much needed improvement in information concerning current trends in sales and stocks, probably until 1953 or 1954.8.     A census in 1950 would fit conveniently with the proposed (and announced)transfer of the Census Office to Cheltenham.     The present plan is to provideabout 600 of the 700 personnel required in 1950 for the census from staff, mostlylocally recruited temporary staff who would otherwise become redundant, released by the Ministry of Pensions.     This has been explained by the Permanent Secretaryof the Ministry of pensions to their staff in Cheltenham.    This staff will beavailable in 1951 to handle work on the Census of Production when that istransferred to Cheltenham.     On present plans postponement for a year would resultin the dispersion of the Ministry of Pensions staff during 1949 and we should be faced with the problem of recruiting other people for the census work towards theend of 1950.     There is, however, the possibility that Ministry of Pensions mightbe able,&apos; with great difficulty, to rearrange their timetable for their transfer to Blackpool.     In that event about two-thirds of the 600 staff would be availableto us a year later.     Most of the remaining 200 Pensions staff, whose work it isalready planned to move, would be wholly lost to us.       If the Ministry of Pensionsfound this rearrangement impossible, we should be in serious difficulties in/building
lilding&apos; up staff in Cheltenham;    indeed it might not be possible to dispersejij Census Office from London as proposed.     Postponement would mean that theIpleus of staff at present working on the census - for which plan3 are wellIvanced - would be dispersed and there would inevitably be a considerablebte of effort.
