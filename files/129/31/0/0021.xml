DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENT:.;    Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1948 &apos; &apos;  &apos; \secretCP. (48) 2916th December, 1948CABINETACQUISITION OF LAND AND BUILDINGS FOR THE PUBLICSERVICEMemorandum by the Minister of works am strongly opposed to the proposal made in the memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C.P. (48) 273) that, for all purchases, long leasesand sales by Government Departments in the United Kingdom, the services ofthe District Valuer should be used for valuation and for negotiation. My reasons are as follows.2. I do not accept the arguments upon which the Chancellor bases his proposal.(a) The necessity to value on the basis of existing use value does notintroduce any serious new complication into valuation. The greatmajority of land sales in this country have always been at existing use value. The only new point arising is that in future all sales shouldbe on that basis.(b) In these circumstances there is nothing very special about the principles which the District Valuers will apply. These are prescribed by lawand regulations, and all valuers, official and private alike, will haveto comply with them.(c) Valuation is not an exact science and the existing use value of aparticular property will vary according to the time at which it isvalued and to the surrounding circumstances. For this reason Ido not agree that the District Valuer would be embarrassed inhis other negotiations concerning the same or neighbouring propertyif my Department were to continue its old-established practice ofcarrying out its own land purchase work.(d) I do not agree that there is any virtue in concentrating all valuation and purchase for public purposes in the hands of the District Valuers.In any case, the circumstances in which the public authorities, towhich the Chancellor refers in paragraph 8, acquire land are totally different from those of my own Department, and experience gainedin the one case is not necessarily of any value in dealing with theother. Land acquired for public works for example, roads and housing is normally acquired in a leisurely manner well ahead ofthe time when it needs to be used. Compulsory powers are, and always have been, normally used, and. the areas of land involved are usually substantial. In the case of my Department, the use of compulsory powers has hitherto been quite exceptional, the areas ofland which we seek to obtain are usually small, and in many cases it is a matter of urgency to obtain possession of the land.(e) I do not agree that the Chancellors proposal would not slow down theprocess of acquisition by my Department. The Chancellor himselfadmits that the Valuation Office machine is under heavy strain, andthe addition of even a.comparatively small load is bound to increase. that strain Does the Chancellor suggest that the work on behalfof my Department would (for example) automatically take precedenceof the determination of development charges ?36248.

23 I do not agree that it would be more businesslike for the District Valuerto act for my Department-on the contrary, I consider that-this would be a much less businesslike arrangement than leaving the work to my own officers. I do not admit that my own officers are less competent than those of the Valuation Office;indeed within their own special field of operations they have more experiencethan the District Valuers. It seldom happens that my Departments require-meht is tied to a single site or building; almost invariably, a choice has to be made from a sometimes considerable number, and the final selection is the result ofweighing up a large number of factors, the relative prices being only one of these.4, Constant consultation about the practicability and comparative cost ofdifferent schemes is required between the negotiator, officers of the client depart-ment departmental architects and engineers, and the owners of the variousproperties under consideration. The development of building schemes frequentlyleads to changes in the extent of land required. Information is needed fromowners about many important details, for example, easements, rights of accessand restrictive covenants. Permission is required to dig trial holes, or to enterand examine the structure of a building.5. If the District Valuer were the officer responsible for actual pricenegotiation, an additional party would be quite unnecesarily introduced intoall these complicated consultations, with resultant delay and decrease in efficiency,and probably at the expense of losing the good-will of owners, who would not find it easy to understand why the Department that was actually discussing with them the requirements for&quot; the building to be erected on the land could notnegotiate with them about the price. Furthermore, it may well be that in some stage of the proceedings we find that we can meet our requirements satisfactorilyby taking a lease, and under the Chancellors scheme, unless we were taking what he describes as a &quot; long lease &apos;&apos; (by which he presumably means a lease of an areaof land at a ground rent), the whole of the negotiations would at that stage haveto be handed back to my Department.6. I must retain staff in my Department with the same professional qualifications as those of the Valuation Office for the purpose of estate management and for the wide range of work which falls outside the limited function of negotiation and valuation. I submit that it would be extremely wasteful ofman-power not to make full use of the professional qualifications of this staff.Furthermore, it would reduce the efficiency of the officers concerned by denyingthem the opportunity to practise their skill and by lowering their professionalstanding. Indeed, I cannot promise that if the&apos; Chancellor&apos;s proposals were accepted I would not have actually to increase my staff to cope with the mass ofcross-reference work to the District Valuers which would have to be undertaken.7. The Chancellor points out that it has been suggested that the necessaryresults could be secured by consultation between the District Valuer and theDepartmental officers locally, with a co-ordinating committee on matters ofprinciple at the centre. He says that thorough discussion of this suggestion atthe official level has shown that it could not be agreed to be a satisfactory solution.In my opinion the suggestion which was put forward during the official discussions would provide a thoroughly satisfactory solution. This was that, when a department wished to acquire a particular property or was considering theacquisition of a particular property, its local officers should consult the DistrictValuer, who would advise them in the light of any information he had bearing on the property m question. The Department would then carry out the valuation and negotiations in the light of the advice and information received from theDistrict Valuer. In order to secure that the officers of Departments, and DistrictValuers, adopt the same principles of valuation, there should be a small central committee of technical officers which would consider the general principles andsettle the lines of general instructions to be given to the technical officers of theDepartments concerned and District Valuers on methods of valuation, &amp;c.Particularly difficult individual cases raising questions of general principle couldbe brought up for discussion at this committee.8. In my opinion these proposals would avoid disrupting the organisation?;umy ?vfPar,tmf1 and lowering its efficiency in the way which would certainlyfollow the adoption of the Chancellors proposal, and would ensure the applica-tion to particular cases of common standards of valuation and the observance of the same general principles of valuation by all Departments.   They would
also make full use of the professional qualifications of the Departmental staffs :and I would point out that it is probable that District Valuers have as muchto learn from their colleagues in other Departments on these matters as they haveto teach them. ?9. I therefore suggest to my colleagues that this system of consultation;should be adopted, rather than a proposal having the effect on the operations ofmy Department which I have explained above, and seemingly based on a mis-conception of the nature of the problem.C. W. K.Ministry of Works, S.E. I,,6th December, 1948.*6f
