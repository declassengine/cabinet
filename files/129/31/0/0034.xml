THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 19482SECRET Copy I^o.CP. (48) 30420th December, 1948CABINET31INTERNATIONAL AUTHORITY FOR THE RUHRMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsRecommendation(i) I ask my colleagues to draft agreement for the establishmentof an International Control Authority for the Ruhr which has been negotiated by representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the French Government, theUnited States Government and the Benelux Governments, and the text of whichis attached at Annex I.(ii) I also ask my colleagues to approve the general lines of the draftcommunique attached at Annex II, and to agree that this should be made publicon 23rd December.background. My colleagues will recall that the report of the London Conference,dated 2nd June, 1948, dealt among other things with the establishment of anInternational Ruhr Authority, and that there was attached to the report (as an annex) a draft agreement on the subject which was subsequently approved byHis Majesty&apos;s Government and the other Governments concerned. The agree-ment was described, in its twelfth article, as a statement of principles whichshould form the basis for a more detailed agreement setting up the international authority. It is this more detailed agreement which I now ask my colleagues to approve.3. Except in one important respect, with which I will deal in more detaillater in this paper, the new agreement is essentially an amplification of the more general statement of principles to which I have referred. It may, however, be helpful to recapitulate very briefly the principal functions of the proposedAuthority.Summary of Provisions of the A greement4. The Authority will be set up as soon as the Agreement has been signed by the six Governments. It will start work as soon as possible thereafter, andin any event before a German Government is established.5. The Authority&apos;s main function (Article 14) will be to allocate Ruhrcoal, coke and steel as between German consumption and export, taking intoaccount the essential needs of Germany as well as the requirements of the recipient countries. During the Control Period (that is to say while supreme authority is still vested in the Occupying Powers) the Authority&apos;s export alloca-tions will be subject in certain specific respects to the prior obligations of the occupying Authorities (Article 21 (i).).6. Provision is made in Article 14 (c) for the establishment of an appro-priate procedure for co-ordinating the decisions of the Authority with thepreparation of programmes and plans for submission to O.E.E.C. This will prevent any attempt on the part of a German Government to play off O.E.E.C.against the Authority. At the same time, it is obviously necessary that nothing which is unanimously agreed by O.E.E.C. should be frustrated by the action ofthe Authority; this point is covered in Article 14 (a) (iii).36307
7 The Authority will also have certain powers with regard to the preven-tion of discriminatory practices and to the protection of foreign interests inGermany (Articles 15 and 16). These powers have been carefully defined, andI am satisfied that, as drafted, they will offer a useful measure of protection against discrimination without interfering during the Control Period with theessential responsibilities of the Occupation Authorities. In any case the powersof the Authority with regard to the protection of foreign interests (Article 16)are contingent upon the signature of some international agreement on this subjectto which the signatory Governments are party; in addition, the Authority will only exercise its powers under this Article if no other international authority iscreated for the purpose.8 Article 20 sets out the powers of the Authority with regard to theobtaining of information and the making of investigations. These provisionshave been drafted in such a way as to ensure that the Authority can obtain (andif necessary check), whatever information it requires for the proper executionof its functions; at the same time, care has been taken not to provide grounds for constant interference at the working level in the operation of the industries concerned. The possibility of investigations being made in Germany outside the ruhr is not excluded, but such investigations are to be governed by a special procedure which, will be worked out by the representatives of the signatory governments on the Authority as soon as it has been constituted.9. In addition to the provisions described above, arrangements are made inArticle 23 for the Authority to exercise certain limited powers in the disarmamentfield if, at the end of the Control Period, no special international body shouldbe created for that purpose.   This is an improbable contingency.   -TO. Article 27 contains a provision, which may prove useful, for annual reviews and for a form of appeal procedure in the event of any two Governmentsconsidering that the Authority is abusing its powers. As drafted, it will preventfrivolous complaints from the German Government designed to hold up the workof the Authority while ensuring that legitimate complaints (such as wouldcertainly be supported by at least one other Government) could be properlyventilated.11. Detailed arrangements are set out in Article 24 for dealing with thepossibility of a German refusal to carry out the decisions of the Authority.These are somewhat complicated in language owing to the desire of the UnitedStates delegation in particular to ensure that the German Government shouldhave the right to appear and defend itself before it is finally declared in defaultand before recommendations are made to the signatory Government for appropriate steps to be taken.12. I invite the attention of my colleagues to the voting provisions containedin Article 9. This provides for fifteen votes to be shared between the sixsignatory Governments and Germany. I cannot, of course, foresee in whatcircumstances the voting procedure will be invoked but the probability is, broadly speaking, it will be invoked on questions which involve the issue of greater orless severity towards Germany. In any such matter, France and Benelux withsix votes between them are likely to be ranged opposite the United States andGermany, also With six votes; and we shall therefore be in a position to cast the decisive votes.Control of Management13. The only important respect in which it is proposed that the present agreement should go beyond the statement of principles contained in the LondonAgreement of 1st June is on the subject of the control of management.*i, l3A&apos; T-he Jun^ A re-inforcement simply provided that *&apos; during the Control period the occupation authorities concerned will maintain adequate control over themanagement in the Ruhr coal, coke and steel industries.&quot; No mention was madeSrtr^nfwTf1&quot; m^encouragement  in the period after the Occupying Powers exercisesupreme authority. Ihe French Government specifically reserved its position onAireS;0%^ n0ltlfying 0thei&apos; GOTerni^nts of its&quot; acceptance of the Junethis score &amp;Tht i^lZ* OU* .df eloP^nts h*ve intensified French feelings onthis score.   The French have interpreted recent American policies towards the
economic future of Germany., particularly as regards the Bizone&apos;s share of E.R.P.and as regards reparations and the level of industry, as an indication of an american desire to build up Germany as the industrial bastion of &quot;western europe. As is well known, the promulgation by the Anglo-American Authoritiesin the Bizone of the Trusteeship Law, the preamble of which affirmed our decisionto leave the determination of the future ownership of German coal and iron andsteel industries to a freely-elected German Government, gave the French particularconcern. They have not yet admitted the principle enshrined in that preamble,and though I believe they will eventually accept it, I consider that it would,in their present delicate political situation, be inadvisable to press them todo so now.14. Because of these circumstances, however, it would have been impossibleto conclude an Agreement on the Ruhr which did not take some account of theFrench reservations about the control of management in the post-occupationperiod. Articles 18 and 19 in the attached draft agreement, which deal with that subject, represent a greatly watered down version of the original French demands.Article 18 provides that responsibility for preventing excessive concentrations of economic power or the assumption of positions of ownership or control in theprincipal Ruhr industries by those who have furthered the aggressive designs ofthe Nazi Party (both desirable objectives specifically stated in the preamble to the trusteeship Law) shall be vested in the Ruhr Authority if not vested in someother body after the control period. Article 19 provides that such of the existing powers of the Occupation Authorities over the direction and management of the ruhr industries as are necessary to ensure that the Authority can properly dis-charge its functions will be transferred to the Authority after the Control Period,unless vested in whatever body is set up to replace the Military Security Board.The nature and extent of the powers to be retained after the Control Period, themanner in which they shall be exercised, and their allocation as between theAuthority and the Military Security Board will, however, be determined later bythe Signatory Governments in the light of the experience during the ControlPeriod.15. I regard these proposals as highly satisfactory. The French are con-tent with a statement of principle to the effect that certain of the powers inquestion will be retained after the Control Period. On the other hand, we arenot committed to retaining any particular power which experience may proveunnecessary, nor to exercising them in a way which might hamper the free andhealthy development of German institutions. We cannot foresee at this stagehow much Allied control over German industry whether for security reasons orto ensure free access to the products of the Ruhr industries, may be desirableafter the end of military occupation. There is, however, advantage in reservingour position in this respect and also in making this clear to the Germans now before the establishment of a provisional German Government. I consider there-fore that the provisions on this subject in the draft Ruhr Agreement are animprovement on the position reached in the June Agreement, in which there wasno provision for any possibility of exercising any control whatever over themanagement of key German industries after the occupation. Neither we nor the americans will agree to the retention of any powers which are not strictly neces-sary, and our combined votes on the Authority, together with those of theGermans, will ensure that any powers retained are not improperly used.Points of difficulty16. There is one provision, relating to the prevention of excessive concen-trations of economic power&apos; (Article 18 (i)), which I have had to scrutinise care-fully in order to protect the decision in the preamble of the Trusteeship Law thatthe determination of the future ownership of German coal and iron and steel industries would be left to a freely elected German Government.17. I do not need to recall the circumstances in which this decision wasreached. The&apos;future ownership of these industries is a question on which we donot see eye to eye with any of our Allies. The decision to leave its determination to the Germans was the only course on which the United States Government and ourselves could agree; and I consider that it was a happy solution to this vexedproblem. On the other hand, it was gravely disquieting to the French, who stillcraved for some form of international ownership. This, we believe, to be bothimpracticable and undesirable.36307 B 2
18. The preamble to the Anglo-American Trusteeship Law also affirmedAnglo-American determination that there should be no restoration of a pattern of ownership in German coal and iron and steel industries which would constitute an excessive concentration of economic power. The French, however, are not partnersto the decision regarding the German choice of future ownership; they have,vigorously criticised it and, for the reasons given in paragraph 13 above, I believethat it would be impolitic to compel them to associate themselves with that decisionnow. Moreover, if we were to insist on this course, it might merely lead themto range themselves with the Americans in favour of private ownership, whichthey might then actively canvass with the Germans.19. It is clearly important, however, that the power of the Authority to take action against excessive concentrations of economic power, which in itself is a highly desirable provision necessary to prevent the recreation of industrial cartelsand otherjvpountrioc inimical to security, should not be used by the French to placeobstacles in the way of a German decision to- nationalise on the ground that thiswould of its very nature constitute such concentration. In a sense the point isacademic, since we earnestly hope that the Germans will have decided to nationalisebefore the end of the Control Period. I have, however, wished to leave no possibleroom for misunderstanding on this score, and I have tried to take the opportunityas far as possible of pinning the French down to an undertaking that they wouldnot regard public ownership in itself as an &quot; excessive concentration of economicpower,&quot; thus improving on the position as it existed before the Ruhr Authoritynegotiations.20. I aril satisfied, however, that it would be impossible to induce either the americans or the French to make a specific reference to public ownership in theAgreement itself without a corresponding reference to private ownership and international ownership which would be objectionable to us. This is not becauseeither of them intend to use the Ruhr Authority to prevent public ownership assuch, but because they consider that it would be inappropriate in the agreement to single out one form of ownership for special reference. They agrue, and withreason, that the ownership of the Ruhr industries by a resurgent aggressiveGerman Central (as opposed to Land) Government at some future date might wellconstitute a danger to security against which we should all wish to take somepreventive action. It has, however, been possible to reach tentative agreement onthe inclusion of an agreed minute (with the full force of the Agreement) in thefollowing terms : &quot; It is agreed that any powers that may be transferred to the authority under paragraph (a) of Article 18 shall not be used by the Authority tomodify any action taken with respect to any pattern of ownership or oftrade or marketing agreements established by, or with the approval of, theOccupation Authorities prior to such transfer, nor shall Article 18 be held to affect the final determination of the ownership of the coal, coke or steel industries of the Ruhr.&quot;Such a clause would ensure that none of the signatories could invoke the Agree-ment against public ownership as such whether effected in the Control period or thereafter. It would constitute implicit admissions by both the French and americans of what both their delegations have both recognised explicitly in thecourse of the talks, namely, that public ownership is not to be regarded in itself asan excessive economic concentration. The French and American Governments havebeen left in no doubt at all as to the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government on this vital issue. I shall take every opportunity of reaffirming these views, and ofemphasising the importance which we attach to public ownership of Germanheavy industry. But we cannot hope to do more than eventually get the french to agree that a decision should be left to the Germans; and it will be our responsibility to do all we can to see that that decision is the right one. Mean-while, the provision quoted above not only leaves the position open but represents a small advance on the part of the French Government. I therefore recommendthat it be accepted.21. Another question of some difficulty is the status of Germany in regardto the Authority. The Americans were anxious from the start that there shouldbe a German representative in the Council as soon as a German Governmentwas established, even if it had not acceded to the Agreement. On the other hand,they were unwilling to make any specific provision for German accession, and wished the votes attributed to Germany to be cast as a block by the representatives
5246of the Occupying Powers. In making this latter stipulation, they undoubtedly hadin mind the prospect of exercising effective control themselves over the Germanvotes. We and the French, on the other hand, thought that it could only giverise to friction if a German representative was free to express the views of its government in the Council without having any say as to the way in which the votes attributed to Germany would be cast. Nor could we accept any form of-words which, in practice, would put at the disposal of the United States repre-sentative on the Council the three votes nominally attributed to Germany. the compromise eventually worked out (Article 4) is not ideal. Read in conjunctionwith Article 31, it means that the German Government will be free to accedeat any time on acceptable terms; that, when it does so, it will appoint a repre-sentative who will cast the three German votes.; and that, in the interval betweenthe formation of a German Government and the accession of the Agreement,the German Government naturally will be represented by a single representativeof the Military Governors. We conceded, however, that, in this intermediatestate, there should be a &quot; German delegate to the Authority &quot; with the right toattend meetings of the Council. But one question which is left unsettled is how the Military Governors will instruct their representative to vote if they themselves are not in agreement. The Americans clearly expect that on certain subjects atany rate something like a J.E.I.A. procedure would apply. An agreed minute(No. 1) exactly reproducing the text of the corresponding agreed minute attachedto the report of the London Conference, is proposed to deal with this point, onwhich we have made formal reservations and which will have to be further con-sidered in connection with the arrangement now under discussion to govern theinter-relationship of the Military Governors under Occupation Statute conditions.Comments22. The negotiation of this agreement has been by no means easy. progress was hampered at the start by French resentment over the Trusteeship Law and,in particular, its statement on ultimate ownership. The course of the negotia-tions was further complicated, though in the end much facilitated, by develop-ments in other fields. In particular, the United States attitude with regard to reparations and the level of industry had created profound suspicions in the minds of the French authorities and, indeed, in our own. It was natural thatthe French delegation should seek to recover in the course of the Ruhr negotia-tions what it appeared to be losing in the field of reparations and level of industry.Similarly, the fact that, when the Ruhr negotiations opened, comparatively little progress had been made with the constitution of the Military Security Board(upon the constitution of which agreement in principle had been reached at theLondon Conference) led to persistent attempts on the part of the French delega-tion to include in the draft agreement security provisions which did not properlybelong to it.23. As the negotiations proceeded, the position changed for the better in both these respects. In particular, a formal statement by the United states ambassador that the United States Government was not pressing for any modifi-cation of the existing limit on steel production and that any such modificationwould have to be made by agreement between the Occupying Powers relieved the tension in the Ruhr negotiations to a remarkable extent. As regards the SecurityBoard, excellent progress was made in the negotiations between the military governors, and this contributed substantially towards a more reasonable frame of mind on the part of the French delegation. Even more important was mr. Douglas&apos;s statement that the United States Government would be favourablyinclined towards a revival of the ideas embodied in the so-called &quot; Byrnes Treaty,&quot;and that it contemplated giving practical expression to these ideas by providing that the Security Board or its successor should be responsible for the long-termdisarmament and demilitarisation of Germany.24. These developments should, I think, be welcomed wholeheartedly both as offering greater guarantees of security and as constituting a detente in rela-tions between the Occupying Powers on the subject of the future of Germany.So far as the Ruhr negotiations were concerned, they went a very long way towards allaying French suspicions of American intentions and creating an atmosphere in which it was possible to negotiate a Ruhr agreement which I regard as being on the whole satisfactory. In particular, by relieving the appre-apprehensions of the French and other delegations on the subject of security, it becamepossible to concentrate more upon the economic aspects of the Ruhr Agreement
which, in its present form, should not cause undue difficulty in our relations withthe Germans.The Communique25. The communique calls for no special comment except that it is intendedto put the Ruhr Authority against the whole background of security in relationto Germany on the one hand and the closer co-ordination of Germany&apos;s economic life with that of Western Europe on the other. I regard it as important thatthe communique should be issued without delay; for the absence of a communiquealtogether, or the publication of a brief non-committal one, would lead to muchundesirable speculation and create great practical difficulties for the FrenchGovernment. It is for similar reasons that I should prefer that- the text of theAgreement, if approved by my colleagues, should be published simultaneously withthe issue of the communique. If, however, it is considered that a longer time is needed to examine the text of the Agreement itself, I would urge that authority should be given to publish the communique immediately, with the explanationthat the Agreement itself will be published as soon as it has been consideredby Governments.E.

At such time as the German Government becomes entitled to cast the votes allocated toGermany, as provided in Article 9 (c), it may appoint a representative on theCouncil and an alternate.(b) The Occupation Authorities concerned shall be represented at theCouncil by one of their nationals jointly designated by them, until such time asthe votes allocated to Germany are cast by the German representative.Article 5The Headquarters of the Authority shall be at such place in Land NorthRhine-Westphalia as the Council may determine.Article 6(a) Each member will pay the expenses of its own representation. Costs oftravel on business of the Authority shall, however, be borne by the Authority.(6) The expenses of the Authority shall be defrayed by the members in pro-portions corresponding to the votes allocated to such members.
(c) Until the Occupying Powers decide otherwise the expenses of the Germanrepresentation and the share of the expenses of the Authority to be defrayed byGermany shall be met in such manner as may be determined by the occupation authorities concerned.Part II. Internal Organisation and ProcedureArticle 7The Council shall hold such regular and special meetings as are necessary tothe performance of its functions.Article 8The Chairmanship of the Council shall be held in rotation for periods of sixmonths each, in such order as the Council shall determine, by the representativesof the Signatory Governments.

In the discharge of their duties, they shallnot seek or receive instructions from any Government or&apos; from any authority otherthan that constituted by the present agreement. They shall refrain from any action which might prejudice their position as international officials. each member of the Authority undertakes to respect the international character of the responsibilities of the Secretariat and will not seek to influence the ExecutiveSecretary or his staff in the discharge of their duties.Article 11The annual budget shall be prepared by the Executive Secretary for approval by the Council.
yArticle 12The Authority shall conduct its business in English, French and&quot; German,of which English and French shall be the official languages. AuthoritativeGerman texts of documents shall be provided as necessary.Article 13Immediately after the present Agreement comes into force the first meeting ofthe Authority shall be convened by the Government of the United kingdom for the purpose of drawing up rules of procedure and operation, choosing an executive Secretary, organising its Secretariat and establishing staff regulations.Decisions on such matters, and any subsequent modifications of those decisions,shall require twelve affirmative votes. Thereafter the setting up of the organisa-tiou shall proceed as rapidly as possible and the Authority shall begin to exercise its functions at times to be established by the Occupying Powers after consulta-tion with the other Signatory Governments, but in any event prior to theestablishment of a German Government.Part III. FunctionsArticle 14(a) The Authority shall make a division of coal, coke, and steel from the ruhr as between German consumption and export.   Such division shall (i) ensure adequate access to supplies of these products by countriesco-operating in the common economic good, taking into account theessential needs of Germany;(ii) be in accordance with the terms of any agreement among the occupying powers with respect to the allocation of coal, coke or steel, whichis in force at the time the division is made;(iii) be consistent with the objectives set forth in the Convention for european Economic Co-operation and with any programme approved,or decision taken, by the Organisation for European economic co-operation, which is applicable to the period for which such divisionis made.(b) The export allocations of the Authority shall be in terms of minimumamounts of coal, coke and finished or semi-finished steel to be made available from the Ruhr for export. The Authority shall have the power to expressthese export allocations in terms of various qualities or types of coal, coke and finished or semi-finished steel. Exceptionally, the Authority may make an allocation of pig-iron if at any time it decides by twelve affirmative votes thatsuch an allocation is necessary in order to ensure adequate access to suppliesof pig-iron. In making export allocations of finished or semi-finished steel,the Authority shall be bound by, and shall act within, any agreements relatingto the level of steel production in Germany which are in force at the time andto which the Occupying Powers concerned are party.(c) Before the Authority begins to exercise its functions under this Article,it will agree with the Occupation Authorities concerned on a procedure forco-ordinating the decisions of the Authority with the preparation of proposedprogrammes and plans for submission to the O.E.E.C. This procedure shall be reviewed at any time at the request of any member, and in any case at the endof the Control Period or at such earlier time as may be agreed upon by the occupying Powers,Article 15The Authority shall have the right to examine transport, price and trade practices, quotas, tariffs, and other governmental measures or commercial arrange-ments instituted or permitted by the German authorities, which affect the coal,coke or steel of the Ruhr. If the Authority determines that such practices,measures or arrangements are artificial or discriminatory and are of such a natureas (i) to impede access by other countries to the coal, coke or steel of the Ruhr,(ii) to distort the movements of Ruhr coal, coke or steel in international trade, or(iii) otherwise to prejudice the accomplishment of the purposes of the present agreement,36307 c
the Authority shall decide that such practices, measures or arrangements shallbe appropriately modified or terminated. In making its determinations underthis Article the Authority shall have due regard for the requirements of mter-national peace and security, for Germany&apos;s obligations under the Convention for european Economic Co-operation, and for the need of the Lrerman authoritiesto afford legitimate protection to the commercial and financial position of germany in international trade.Article 16(a) During the Control Period, or until such earlier time as may be agreedupon by the Occupying Powers, the Authority shall bring to the attention of theOccupation Authorities concerned measures which would ensure, and after such period or time the Authority shall itself ensure, in conformity with any mter-national agreements relating to the protection of foreign interests in germany in force at the time, to which the Signatory Governments are party (i) the safeguard and protection of foreign interests in coal, coke and steelenterprises in the Ruhr, and(ii) the protection of such enterprises involving foreign interests from theapplication of discriminatory measures in any sector of their activity;provided that when and to the extent that the protection of such foreign interests or enterprises is entrusted to any agency created or designated by any international agreement to which the Signatory Governments are party, the functions of theAuthority in this matter shall cease.(6) At the end of the Control Period, or at such earlier time as may be agreedupon by the Occupying Powers, the functions of the Authority referred to inparagraph (a) of this Article shall, unless they have previously ceased, be reviewed by the Signatory Governments, taking into account the desirability of trans-ferring these functions to a separate agency or of extending them to the Aachenarea.Article 17(a) During the Control Period, or until such earlier time as may be agreedupon by the Occupying Powers, the Occupation Authorities concerned will main-tain such powers as may be necessary to enforce the disarmament of Germany,including power to control the supply of Ruhr coal, coke and steel to any industry which may be prohibited or limited in the interests of security by agreement amongthe Occupying Powers or under the terms of any international agreement to whichthey may become party.(h) After the termination of the Control Period, or at such earlier time asmay be agreed upon by the Occupying Powers, the powers referred to in para-graph (a) of this Article shall be transferred to such international body as maybe designated for these purposes by the peace settlement or by any international agreement to which the Signatory Governments are party, and the Authority shallco-operate with that international body in such ways as shall be prescribed by thepeace settlement or international agreement. If &quot;no such international body is established, these powers shall be transferred to the Authority to be exercised bythe representatives of the Signatory Governments thereon.Article 18(a) At the end of the Control Period, or at such earlier time as may beagreed upon by the Occupying Powers, such of the existing powers of the Occupa-tion Authorities as are necessary to ensure (i) that there shall not be allowed to develop, or be restored&apos;, any pattern of ownership in the Ruhr coal, coke or steel industries, or trade and marketing agreements among such industries, which would constituteexcessive concentration of economic power;(ii) that persons who have been, or may be, found to have furthered theaggressive designs of the National Socialist Party do not holdimportant positions in the direction or management, or substantialinterests m the ownership, of the Ruhr coal, coke or steel industriesfw\ tw   a   &apos;rT-a?4 marketing organisations of such industries; and(m) that adequate information is made available for the purposes specifiedin sub-paragraphs (l) and (n) above,will be transferred to the Authority or to the Military Security Board or itssuccessor or to some otfier body created by international agreement and charged

\   ANNEX II:- RUHR  conference draft Communique, 19th December, 1948Representatives of Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, theUnited Kingdom and the United States met in London from 11th November toDecember, 1948, to draft a detailed agreement establishing an Inter-national Authority for the Ruhr for submission to their Governments, as provided in the annex to the communique issued on 2nd June, 1948, at the terminationof the London Six-Power talks on Germany. The text will be published shortly.The meeting, which was held in an exceptionally friendly atmosphere throughout,carefully examined all aspects of the problems involved.2. It was recognised at the outset that a number of organisations are being-established and arrangements being worked out with respect to Germany. the ruhr Authority is one of them and should be viewed in this context. To avoidduplication of effort and overlapping of jurisdiction each of these has itsparticular functions. Taken together they are designed to accomplish a threefoldobjective : to complete and maintain the disarmament and demilitarisation ofGermany; to further the recovery of the countries of Europe, including a demo-cratic Germany; and to promote that intimate association of their economic lifewhich in the last analysis alone can assure a peaceful and prosperous Europe.3. Among the arrangements designed to prevent aggression, the military security Board is one of the most important. The functions of this Board haverecently been agreed upon in principle by the three Military Governors. they include provision for co-operation with the Ruhr Authority. The Board willhave general responsibility for the maintenance of industrial disarmament anddemilitarisation in the interests of security. As regards industrial disarmament,the Board will act in accordance with agreements which are in the course of completion concerning the necessary prohibitions and limitations on german industry. It was recognised that a ceiling of 10-7 million tons on the productionof crude steel is now in effect in the Bizonal Area. This ceiling is not now underconsideration.4. In 1946, the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Byrnes, put forwardcertain ideas for assuring the effective disarmament and demilitarisation ofGermany. It is anticipated that the objectives and mechanisms envisaged byMr. Byrnes&apos;s proposal will, to the extent appropriate, form a basis for long-termdisarmament and demilitarisation measures to be worked out through and adapted to the Military Security Board or any other organisation established as itssuccessor to perform these functions. These measures will be designed solely to prevent the revival of German aggression.5. Within this framework it is the purpose of the Six Powers to providethe means by which a peaceful democratic Germany can be brought into theEuropean community to play its part as a fully responsible and independentmember. The participation of the Western Zones of Germany in the european recovery Programme and in the Organisation for European Economic Co-opera-tion already demonstrates the intention of the Western Powers to afford toGermany its place in the economic life of Europe.6. With these various factors in mind, it has been a main objective of the six Powers, in establishing the Ruhr Authority, to ensure that the resourcesof the Ruhr shall in the future be used not for purposes of aggression but solelyin the interests of peace, and to provide for a closer co-ordination of the economic life of the countries of Europe, co-operating in the common good, including a democratic Germany.7. During the period that the Occupation Authorities are exercisingextensive economic functions in Germany, the decisions of the Authority will becarried out largely by or through the Occupation Authorities. As, however, theyrelinquish their functions, the Authority will be in more and more direct relation-ship with the German Government in the exercise of its functions.8. A principal function of the Ruhr Authority is to make a division of thecoal, coke and steel from the Ruhr as between German consumption and exportin order to provide adeqaute access to supplies of these products by countries
co-operating in the common economic good, at the same time taking into account the essential needs of Germany. This division must, of course, be in conformity,with existing international agreements. Thus, in the case of coal and coke thesliding scales drawn up in Moscow and Berlin continue in force.9. The functions of the Ruhr Authority in the above field will be co-co-ordinated with the larger and more comprehensive operations of the O.E.E.C. in its workof promoting the economic rehabilitation of the countries participating in theEuropean Recovery Programme.10. The Authority will have powers to ensure that the German Authoritiesdo not institute, carry out or permit artificial or discriminatory transport, price and trade practices, quotas, tariffs and similar governmental measures or com-mercial arrangements which would distort the movement of Ruhr coal, coke andsteel in international trade, except for measures of protection approved by theAuthority.11. The Authority will furthermore be charged with responsibility for thesafeguard and protection of foreign interests in the coal, coke and steel industries of the Ruhr in conformity with international agreements, in so far as these functions are not entrusted to another body for the whole of Germany.12. Particular attention was paid to the question of giving the Authoritypowers of supervision over the management and direction of the Ruhr coal, cokeand steel industries. The Coal and Steel Control Groups established by the Britishand American Occupation Authorities now have extensive powers over these industries, including powers over production, investment, development and othermatters concerning management and direction. As is known, the french authorities have been invited to join in the work of these Control Groups. It hasbeen agreed that at the appropriate time such of these powers relating to the super-vision, of management and direction as the Six Powers consider necessary to achieve their purposes with respect to the security and well-being of Europe willbe transferred to the Ruhr Authority or to the Military Security Board or itssuccessor or to some other international body. The conditions under which these powers will be transferred, and the manner in which they will be exercised, willbe determined as soon as practicable in the light of experience acquired over aperiod of time under the present Control Groups. It was agreed that the powersto be continued should also be adequate to prevent the revival of excessive economicconcentration in the coal, coke or steel industries of the Ruhr and to preventpersons who furthered the aggressive designs of the Nazis from acquiringimportant ownership interests or positions of direction and management in those industries. The agenda of the meeting did. not include the question of the finalownership of the industries concerned and this question is in no way affected by thedraft agreement.13. The Authority will have the right to obtain information necessary toenable it to perform its functions, including adequate rights of inspection andinvestigation.14. The Authority will consist of a Council composed of representativesof the member Governments and will have a permanent Secretariat.15. As soon as a German Government is established, it will have the oppor-tunity of acceding to the Agreement, the vote for Germany being exercised mean-while by the Occupation authorities. When a German Government has under-taken the full obligations of its membership, it will enjoy full voting rights exceptin matters of security and default.16. The Authority, if its decisions and directives are not properly respectedby the German Government, may find the latter in default and make recom-mendations as to the action to be taken.17. The Authority will submit an annual report on its work which will normally be followed by a meeting of specially appointed representatives of member&apos; Governments to review the report and the work of the Authority. any two or more members, who consider that the policies of the Authority are notconsistent with the purposes for which it was created, may call for a specialexamination of its operations by the member Governments. Germany may notinitiate such examinations in matters relating to security.18. In the past the resources of the Ruhr have been used for the purposesof aggression.   The six Governments are determined that, through the security
measures referred to above, any recurrence of such a situation shall be prevented.. They are equally aware that the political and economic welfare of Europe requires the full and effective use of the industrial production of the Ruhr and the parti -cipation of a democratic Germany in the comity of nations, all enjoying a reason-able standard of prosperity. The establishment of the Ruhr Authority is aninnovation in the international economic field. It is not being set up to limitfree competition by European industries in the markets of the world. It has a constructive function to fulfil in promoting the general economic well-being ofEurope and in re-establishing international confidence. If operated wisely, the ruhr Authority may be regarded as a further contributory step towards a moreintimate economic association among the countries of Western Europe.
