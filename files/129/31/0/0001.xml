THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1948SECRET Copy No.   SICP. (38) 271lQth November, 1948CABINETASSISTANCE OF THE LAW OFFICEESNote by the Prime minister it is very desirable that we should make full use of the experience of theLaw Officers on the legal aspects of policy questions. I have not here in mind the long-established and valuable practice of referring difficult legal issues tothe Law Officers for a formal Opinion, but rather the general assistance whichthey can give to their Ministerial colleagues on the legal questions which arise in the formulation and administration of policy.I hope, therefore, that Ministers in charge of Departments will not hesitate to consult the Law Officers, as colleagues in the Government, on questions where their advice is likely to be of value.Chairmen of Cabinet Committees should also bear in mind the value ofsecuring the attendance of one of the Law Officers at any meeting at which legalissues are likely to arise.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S. W. 1,l$th November, 1948.
