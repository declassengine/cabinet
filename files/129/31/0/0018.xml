(48) 255).R. S. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,6th December, 1948.ECONOMIC report . Man-power the total working population, which had been falling since November 1947,rose in August by 43,000 and in September by 30,000. In both months the increase was due mainly to school-leavers entering employment.2. In spite of an increase of 13,000 in the number of persons registered as unemployed, the total number of persons in civil employment rose again inSeptember by 46,000 to 19,183,000. In the manufacturing industries there was an increase of 27,000 in the number of persons employed (17,000 men and 10,000women). All the main groups of the manufacturing industries, except those pro-ducing building materials, recorded greater employment. The total number employed in the basic industries (mining, agriculture, fishing, transport, shipping and public utilities) was unchanged in September. Employment in building and civil engineering increased by 17,000 to 1,386,000 in September but declined to1,376,000 in October.Under-manned industries3. Both agriculture and the textile industries gained 4,000 more workersin September. Employment in cotton spinning rose from 159,000 to 160,000,employment in cotton weaving from 123,000 to 124,000 and employment in woolfrom 183,000 to 184,000. In the coal industry, the number of wage-earners onthe books declined from 726,000 to 725,000.U nemployment4. The number of unemployed persons registered for employment in GreatBritain rose from 294,300 at 13th September to 314,500 at 11th October. Thisrise of 20,000, which was the same as the rise between September and October 1947,was due mainly to seasonal unemployment in the hotel, catering and entertainmentindustries.
II. Production5. The index of total industrial production (1946 = 100) recovered inSeptember to the level of 124 achieved in June. This was nine points abovethe level in September 1947. The index for manufacturing industries alonerose in September to a record level of 128 and was ten points above the indexfor September 1947. These figures suggest that the decline in the index inJuly and August may have been due mainly to more widespread holidays thisyear. Production usually rises to a seasonal peak in October and November, andthe statistics of output in October so far available suggest that the index of total production will be higher than in September. It will not be possible to say whether the rate of increase has slowed down until the figures for the last quarterof the year are available.Interim Index of Industrial Production (1946 = 100)MayJuneJulyAugust ..SeptemberOctober ..NovemberDecember	All Industries		Manufacturing Industries		1947	1948	Increase	1947	1948	Increase109	118	+ 8	111	119	+ 8114	124	+ 9	116	127	+ 11107	112	+ 5	109	114	+ 5104	110	+ 6    .	105	112	+ 7115	124	+ 9	117	128	+ 10120			122		123			123		115			115		Coal6. The total amount of deep-mined coal raised in the forty-seven weeks ended 27th November amounted to 177 - 8 million tons 3 - 8 million tons short ofthe target for this period. It was 9 - 2 million tons or 5 - 5 per cent, more than inthe corresponding period of 1947. The weekly rate of output increased slightly in November to 4-09 million tons; but this was only 2-3 per cent, above the levelin November 1947 when output rose on the introduction of the extra hours agree-ment. Increased output now depends on an improvement in attendance andfurther increases in output per man shift and in man-power.7. Absenteeism is lower than in September and October but is still greaterthan in the corresponding period of 1947.8. Output per man shift overall, after showing little change since last autumn, has risen steadily in October and in the week ended 20th november was 1-15 tons the highest level achieved since the war. Output per manshiftat the coal face was also a post-war record of 3-02 tons.9. : Recruitment to the industry remains disappointingly low. The totalnumber on the books increased by 800 in the five weeks ended 13th november to 725,100 but this is still below the level in July. The number of face workersin the week ended 13th November was 294,100, which is 1,350 more than inJuly. During the third week of November there was a fall of 1,400 in thetotal number on the colliery books, due mainly to the closing of the East andSteer Pits, Gwaun-cae-Gurwen. Agreement has now been reached to reopen thesepits this week under revised working conditions.10. Overseas shipments and bunkers are being maintained at about 400,000tons a week and the target of 16 million tons for 1948 will probably be attained.On present levels of output, coal exports will only be increased substantially above this r;ate by reducing stocks or restricting home consumption.Iron and steel11. The output of steel ingots and castings rose in November to a new recordlevel of 303,000 tons a week. The output of pig-iron also rose to a new high levelof 185,000 tons a, week in November. In spite of the increased consumption of scrap by the steel furnaces, stocks are now higher than at any time since July 1947and are expected to remain at about their present level of. 480,000 tons. Stocksof pig-iron are also being maintained at a higher level and are expected to rise from 479,000 tons at the end of October to 589,000 tons at the end of January 1949.
Textiles12. In the first week of November the output of cotton yarn rose to 18-44million lbs.-equal to the previous post-war peak in June but fell back to 18-37million lbs. in the second week and to 18-35 million lbs. in the week ended20th November.13. Production of rayon yarn and staple fibre declined from the record levelof 20-9 million lbs. in September to 20-4 million lbs. in October. This is stillabove the previous record of 20 -1 million lbs. in October 1947.Motor vehicles14. The output of passenger cars declined from 6,926 a week in september to 6,539 a week in October. More cars were produced for the home market and production for export fell from 5,046 a week in September to 4,522 in October.The proportion of large cars produced continues to rise. The number of cars ofover 2,200 c.c. produced rose from 707 a week in September to 833 a week inOctober, and of these the number produced for export rose from 408 to 487 a week.15. Output of commercial vehicles increased in October from 3,453 to3,906 a week, the increase being accounted for entirely by larger production for the home market.16. During October 18,606 new permanent houses were completed in GreatBritain. The number of new houses started was maintained in October at thehigher level reached in September and the number under construction declinedfurther from 197,931 to 194,424 during October.17. The number of houses for which new contracts were granted rose to 21,986 in October the highest figure this year and the number of houses oncontract but not started rose to 58,214 at the end of the month.18. The value of British exports rose in October to  140 million. (Thevolume of these exports is estimated at 142 per cent, of the 1938 average comparedwith 132 in September and the post-war peak of 149 in July.) The increase inthe value of exports in October was accounted for mainly by a rise of  6-1 million in exports of metal goods. Exports of cotton goods, at  11 - 6 million, were thesame as in September and lower than the third quarter average; but exports ofwoollen goods rose above the third quarter average to  8-6 million.19. The value of imports also rose in October from  169 - 4 to  174 - 5 million.Imports of food, drink and tobacco increased to  77 - 3 million, a figure only twiceexceeded since July 1947. Most of this rise was due to an increase in thevalue of imports of grain and flour to  21-6 million the highest level since1920 reflecting higher prices under the Canadian contract.20. The adverse visible balance of trade (imports (c.i.f.) less exports andre-exports (f.o.b.)) declined in October to  29 million the lowest since january 1947 compared with a monthly average of  34 -1 million in the thirdquarter and of  44-1 million in the second quarter of this year. Athough the adverse visible balance with the Western Hemisphere countries is less than in1947 no further improvement has been obtained since the beginning of the year.Ill-BuildingIY.

Y. Balance of Payments21.   The net gold and dollar deficit, which was only  22 million in October,rose sharply to  46 million in November.   For this there were two principalreasons : heavily increased takings by India, and larger expenditure by United \Kingdom departments on imports.22. India. Under our agreement with India she is entitled to draw anet amount of  15 million from the Central reserves during the year July 1948 toJune 1949. Drawings in the first quarter amounted to  7 -1 million. In October,however, she made a net contribution of  2-3 million. It is not yet possible tosay exactly what her takings have been in November, but very heavy grossdrawings (that is, before allowing for her dollar receipts through London) suggestthat the net drawings may have been as much as  10 million or more. (against this, India borrowed $8 million from the International Monetary Fund, whichwere sold to us.) Thus India alone may account for approximately  12 million of the increase between October and November.23. Though large these drawings have not been unexpected or in excessof the agreement. It was known that India intended to draw practically thewhole of her allowance before the end of this year. We may, therefore, expecta very big reduction in the rate of loss from now on.24. Departmental expenditure on imports. Expenditure both on food andraw materials has recently been running in excess of departmental programmes for the current quarter. This applies particularly to purchases of bacon andham, cereals and non-ferrous metals from Canada, milk products and cottonfrom the United States and sugar from Cuba. A reduction in the rate of expendi-ture may be looked for over the next few weeks.25. Cash reimbursements from the E.C.A. amounted to  31 million inNovember, compared with  17 million in October. The increase, thoughsubstantial, was of course not as big as the rise in the gold and dollar deficit;our gold and dollar holdings therefore continued to fall. It is hoped that the better trend of reimbursements will continue. If, in addition, the dollar deficitfalls in the manner looked for, the drain on our physical holdings might come toan end, and a start made to increase them.26. Sterling balances of both sterling and non-sterling area countries fellsharply in the third quarter of this year. The reasons are complex and numerous.Sterling area balances, which fell by  61 million, have been affected by specialtransactions such as the settlement with India, under which we received 45 million, and redemption of a Government loan by Australia ( 15^ million).In addition the rate of capital outflow to South Africa has been substantially reduced.27. Non-sterling Area balances fell by  69 million. Argentina, who is ineffect repaying the loan, made to her under the Andes agreement, is responsiblefor  21 million. The rest is spread over a large number of countries and reflectsa steady improvement in our balance of payments position with them. On theother hand, our situation with regard to a number of the hard currency countries,such as Belgium and Switzerland, remains very difficult.28. We lost  1 million in gold to Switzerland both in October and November.Our loss to Belgium in October amounted to  2^ million. But in addition we drew 3J million ($13 million) of our Belgium grants under the Intra-european payments Scheme in October, while in November we have probably drawn thewhole of the remaining  2-*- million ($91 million) which we are permitted todraw up to the end of next March. From now on, therefore, until that dateour deficit with Belgium must be settled in gold.VI. prices import and export Prices29. The index of import prices (1938 = 100) which fell from 292 to 289 inSeptember rose to 293 in October. This rise was due to higher food prices,mainly Canadian wheat at the new contract price and flour. The group indexfor food, drink and tobacco rose by 4 per cent, from 266 in September to 276 inOctober.  The price index of United Kingdom exports was unchanged at 258 in
October so that the terms of trade changed adversely after the improvement duringthe two previous months.Retail prices30. Although the Interim Index of Retail Prices (June 1947 = 100)remained unchanged in October at 108, the index of clothing prices rose furtherfrom 113 to 114, and the index of fuel and light prices from 111 to 112 betweenSeptember and October. There has been no significant change since August in theindex of food prices which is now slightly lower than in February of this year.Index of Retail Food Prices(June 1947 = 100)1948 JanuaryFebruaryMarchApril...May   ...103-6108-3108-8109-3108-41948 June  ...July   ...AugustSeptemberOctober113108-107-107-107-6Wholesale prices31. There was no significant change during October in the Board of Tradeindex of wholesale prices. Increases in prices of non-ferrous metals more than offset further reductions in cotton and wool prices which have been mainly responsible for the decline in the general index during the last few months.A merican prices32. The latest figures available show that American wholesale prices arenow falling though it is impossible to say whether this trend will continue. Thegeneral index of wholesale prices declined by 4 points in October from 214 to 210(1938 = 100) influenced mainly by the continuing decline in the index of whole-sale prices of farm products from the peak of 286 in July to 267 in October.Moody&apos;s index of staple commodity prices has shown little movement during thefirst three weeks of November.VII.-Wage Rates33. The index of wage rates (June 1947 = 100), which had remained un-changed at 106 between June and September, rose to 107 in October. This was due mainly to the rise in the index for engineering, shipbuilding and other metalindustries from 102 to 105.34. Increases in wage rates which became effective in October as the resultof agreements reached during the month or earlier added approximately  494,000to the weekly wages of 2,137,500 workers. Much the largest increase was theaddition of  455,400 a week for 1,900,500 workers in the metal, engineering and shipbuilding group. About 110,000 workers in the carpet and boot and shoeindustries suffered a reduction of wages of about  15,000 a week, as the resultof cost of living sliding scale agreements.35. The agreement reached in October in the constructional engineering industry follows the recent increase in the engineering industry, although a claim for a much larger amount was rejected by the National Arbitration Tribunal inSeptember, The increase in the rayon industry follows increases in other textile industries this year. An agreement has been reached in November in theengineering industry for an increase of 4s. a week for women workers.36. None of the new claims presented in November is of major importance.Three claims, in the paint, plaster board and brick making trades, would, ifgranted, probably raise the cost of building materials.37. No new developments have been reported on the railway claims since they were rejected by the Executives. The Agricultural Wages Board met on 3rd November to consider a resolution by the workers&apos; side for wage increases, areduction in hours and an increase in annual holidays. It is possible that theremay be new claims by the Scottish executive of the National Union of Mine-workers and a general wage application in the electricity supply industry.
YIIL-Bilateral Negotiations38. After protracted negotiations an agreement on trade with Japan forthe year ending 30th June, 1949, was concluded on 9th November between theSupreme Commander, Allied Powers, on the one hand and the United Kingdom,Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and India on the other. This providesfor a considerable expansion of trade on a sterling basis between Japan and theCommonwealth countries under which large quantities of cotton textiles will beavailable for the Colonies.39. A new payments agreement has been negotiated in Rome under whichthe Italian Government undertake to maintain a cross-rate of 4-03 between the pound sterling and the United States dollar and Italy is admitted into thetransferable account area.40. A mission is in Turkey discussing our balance of payments with thatcountry and negotiating imports of food-stuffs and raw materials.41. Discussions will shortly take place with the United States Governmentfor the prolongation for three months from the end of 1948 of the existingFusion Agreement for the Combined Zones of Germany. This will enable thenegotiations for a Trizonal Fusion Agreement to be deferred until a ProvisionalGovernment has been formed in Western Germany. When the extension ofthe Fusion Agreement has been agreed, it is intended to revise our trade and payments arrangements with Western Germany to take account of the Intra-European Payments Agreement and the fusion of the French Zone with the combined Zones.42. The long-protracted negotiations with Yugoslavia are almost complete;the main outstanding question is the amount to be paid by Yugoslavia incompensation for the acquisition of the assets of British firms.43. Negotiations with the Russians on trade and payments continue inLondon. Efforts are being made to persuade the Russians to increase their offer of grain and to speed up the negotiations.i 4l4. Senor Miranda has now stated that he will be unable to come to Londonbefore 10th January. The Overseas Negotiations Committee are consideringthe tactics to be adopted with Senor Miranda, and what should be done to reach an early agreement with Argentina on trade and payments in 1949 if SenorMiranda is eventually unable to come on that date.45. The negotiations in Warsaw have been very difficult, particularly onthe question of debt and compensation payments; but the prospects of agreement are not unhopeful.46. The Overseas Negotiations Committee have been reviewing our balanceof payments position with Belgium and Switzerland. The position in both caseshas proved to be much worse than we had feared. The sterling area deficitwith Belgium in 1948 will involve gold sales of some  36 million ( 30^ million hasalready been paid), and the sterling area deficit with Switzerland may involvegold sales of  11 million ( 5 million more than we had expected). further negotiations with Belgium to cover the first six months of 1949 will have totake place in the near future, and negotiations with Switzerland for the yearbeginning 1st March, 1949, have been fixed for early January. The overseas negotiations Committee have submitted reports on these two countries.47. Trade and Payments negotiations for 1949 will begin in the near futurewith Egypt and Norway.48. Negotiations are continuing with Mexico, Sweden and Spain; theDepartments concerned have been discussing trade and payments with a Pakistanrepresentative; and discussions are now taking place with Danish representatives on trading arrangements in 1949, the main outlines of which were settled duringthe negotiations in September.IX. European Recovery Programme49. 1948-49 Programme. Discussions are still continuing with E.C.A.regarding the 1948-49 Programme of the United Kingdom, particularly in regardto the inclusion of the 152 million in the calculation of the United Kingdomdollar deficit (referred to in CP. (48) 232, paragraph 45), and to the eligibility
for E.R.P. financing of $84 million for the procurement of petroleum equipment for British-owned or controlled companies operating in the Middle East, far east and Western Hemisphere. It is practically certain that the latter will beaccepted. With regard to cotton, E.C.A. refused to accept for reimbursementI cotton purchases to the value of f49 million made after 21st May withouti their prior approval. They insisted that the contracts must be re-negotiatedand that United Kingdom purchases must contain 15 per cent, of low-gradecotton. We have had to agree to re-negotiate, but have reduced the 15 per cent,to 12^ per cent., of which 5 per cent, may be cotton waste, which we shouldwant to buy in any case. Discussions are going on with E.C.A. to secure their acceptance of the $15 million of cotton which has already been shipped and cannot therefore be the subject of negotiation.50. 1949-50 Programme. Examination of the 1949-50 Programmes of Par-participating Countries has been continued in Paris and discussions are proceeding on the form of the Report to be drawn up by O.E.E.C.51. Long-term Programme. It is now clear that owing to the delay in sub-mission of programmes by many countries, notably by Benelux whose programme was only received at the end of November, it will not now be possible to handE.C.A. by 7th December a European programme of the kind originally contem-plated. The O.E.E.C. Report will probably not be issued until about 20th Decem-ber. It will contain a summary of the National Programmes, and will outline their main features and the problems they throw up; no attempt can, however, be madein the time available to suggest solutions.52. The United Kingdom Long-Term and 1949/1950 Programmes will bepublished as a White Paper as soon as the Report is handed to E.C.A.53. E.R.P. Reimbursement. Anxiety has been felt at the delay in securingreimbursement from E.C.A. funds of dollar expenditure by the United Kingdomand at the resultant temporary drawing down of our reserves. This has been mainly caused by E.C.A.&apos;s delay in accepting certain important items as eligiblefor E.R.P. financing and by the difficult documentation requirements that E.CA.has laid down. Special steps have recently been taken to eliminate delay in sub-mitting documents to E.C.A. E.C.A. has now agreed that 95 per cent, of aneligible payment will be reimbursed on certification by us that it has been madeThe remaining 5 per cent, is paid on provision of full documentation which weundertake to do within ninety days. This is an extension of a previous arrange-ment under which the spot reimbursement was only 90 per cent, and only sixtydays were allowed for providing the documents. The result of these measureshas been a notable increase in the rate of receipts from E.C.A. in the past fort-night. A further concession agreed by E.C.A. is a simplification of the document-tation of machinery imports (on private account) with individual values between$1,000 and $10,000.
