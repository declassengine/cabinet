(48) 27721ST NOVEMBER.  1948CABINETBIRE&apos;S FUTURE RELATIONS WITH THE COMMONWEALTHNote &quot;by the Secretary of State for commonwealth Re 1 at 1 onsWith reference to CM. (48) 74th Conclusions,Minute 6(3),  I circulate herewith, for the considerationof my colleagues, the draft of a statement which mightbe made in Parliament on behalf of the United KingdomGovernment on 25th IvTovember,  1948.P. J. N-B.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1. ,21st November, 1948..
A .N N E X&apos;    ; DRAFT statement in 1937 a new Constitution was enacted in Eire in which no reference was made to the Crown.This, however, left in force the Eire executive authority (External Relations) Act of 1936, -whichauthorised His hajesty The King to act on behalf of eire in certain matters within the field of external affairs as and when advised, by the Eire Executive Council to do so.In December, 1937? the United Kingdom Government stated,after consultation with the Governments of Canada, Australia,New Zealand and South Africa, that they, like those governments, were prepared to treat the new constitution as not effecting a- fundamental alteration in the positionof Eire as a member of the Commonwealth.On 7th September last the Prime hinistor of eire, Mr. Costello, announced during a visit to Canadathat the Eire Government were preparing to repeal the external Relations Act.    Subsequently, on his return to eire, Mr. Costello confirmed this intention.As the House is aware, I took advantage of thepresence in London during October of other commonwealth ministers to arrange on 17th October for preliminary discussions with Eire Ministers in order to explore theconsequences which would flow from the legislation proposedin Eire.   Representatives of Canada, Australia and NewZealand, the other Commonwealth countries in which there are particularly large numbers of people of Irish extraction,participated in these discussions.Since then the matter has been under constantexamination here.   When the Eire Government announced thattheir Repeal Bill (to be entitled the &quot;Republic of IrelandBill&quot;) would be introduced on  17th November,  I thought
It right that the situation should be further discussed,with, members of the Eire Government and with the PrimeMinister of hew Zealand, &apos;the Deputy Prime Minister ofAustralia and the Canadian Secretary of State for external affairs, all of whom ware in Paris for the meeting cf theGeneral Assembly of the United Nations.    Discussions tookplace accordingly In Paris last week.^s a result of these discussions the United KingdomGovemiment have been able to give the most careful considerationto the i-elaticns between the United Kingdom and Eire whenthe republic of Ireland Bill comes into force.    The UnitedKingdom Government recognise with regret that,  as has been stated by Eire Ministers, Eire will then no longer be a member of theCommonwealth,    The Eire Government have, however, stated thatthey recognise the existence of a specially close relationship between Eire and the Commonwealth countries and desire thatthis relationship should he maintained.    As Mr, MacBride said in the debate in the Dail on 20th November, these close relationsarise from ties of blood and kinship and from traditionaland long-established economic, social and trade  connectionsbased on common interest.    The United Kingdom Government, fortheir part,  associate themselves with the views expressedby Mr. MacBride and are at one with the Eire Government indesiring that these close and friendly relations shouldcontinue and be strengthened.accordingly the United Kingdom Government will not regard, the enactment of this legislation by Eire as requiringthem to treat Eire as a foreign country or Eire citizens asforeigners.    They have ascertained that the other members ofthe Commonwealth share this view and will follow the samepolicy.So far as Eire citizens are concerned, the positionin the United Kingdom will be governed by the british nationality Act, 19h8, and legislation on similar
lines has been passed,  or is in contemplation, in other commonwealth countries.   Mr. MocBride has stated that the eire Government propose to ensure that under theirlegislation citizens of Commonwealth countries will receivecomparable treatment in Eire.
