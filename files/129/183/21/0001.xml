THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 7118 June 1975CONTINGENCY PLANS FOR THREATENED RAIL STOPPAGEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department, The Civil Contingencies Unit, under my chairmanship, has beenkeeping closely in touch with developments over recent weeks with a viewto identifying at an early stage the difficulties that might arise if the projected strike by the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR) takes place.Tho purpose of this memorandum is to tell my colleagues where we standwith our contingency plans and to seek their approval of several decisions which must be taken by Friday of this week.2. I attach a summary by officials which shows what the effect of a railstoppage would be on the main essential supplies and services, and theaction which would be necessary to ease the difficulties which are foreseen.The broad conclusion to which this summary points is that a national railstrike would not begin to bite hard on essential services during the firstmonth or so.    There are, however, the following difficulties which arise   11immediately on which action has to be taken this week -a. Railway passenger and freight services.    The british railways Board (BRB) will need to tell the public how the railservices will be run down at the weekend before the stoppage isdue to take place so that railway users can adapt their plansaccordingly.    Publicity will need to be issued early on Friday atthe latest.b. London commuters.    The Metropolitan Police, in consultationwith the Department of the Environment, have made plans to dealwith a greatly increased flow of road traffic into London.    Publicityabout these plans should also be issued on Friday morning if it is tohave widespread effect.c. Ferry services.    All British Rail Ferries will cease to operate on Sunday evening, and although British Rail carry rather less than half the cross-Channel traffic, this will still affect seaborne traffic to the Continent.    The BRB would therefore like to give the publicdue warning of probable effects of a stoppage of these services.COPY NO     82CABINET
If the strike does take place statements will need to be made by the BRBand the Metropolitan Police about their contingency plans to deal with its effects, and it would not in my view be provocative if these statements were made this week.    There need be no reference to the governments attitude in the publicity that is issued, which need not prejudice any negotiations that may still be taking place between the BRB and the NURat the end of the week,    I therefore recommend that the Railways Boardand the Metropolitan Police should be told to go ahead with the issue of publicity any time from midday on Thursday onwards,3.        About a quarter of oil deliveries are moved by rail at some stage.A number of essential users, including hospitals, the food industries,community services and public transport services obtain their oil supplies from rail-fed terminals, and to protect the interests of these consumersin the event of an extended strike, the Secretary of State for Energy haspowers to issue a Direction to the companies who own the rail-fedterminals requiring them to reserve their stocks for priority users.    TheDirection operates by permitting the supply of motor fuel and oil fuel only for purposes specified in a detailed schedule.    The issue of a Directionearly on would safeguard oil stocks for priority users probably for a 12 weekperiod; but the longer the issue of a Direction is delayed, the shorter wouldbe the duration of the time that the stocks would last.    I recommend thatthe Cabinet should agree now that the Secretary of State for Energy should issue a Direction as soon as he judges that oil stocks should be safeguardedin this way.    It may be necessary to tighten up the application of theDirection by excluding certain manufacturing processes from the schedule of authorised purposes; but I would seek the approval of my colleagues should any fundamental point of policy be involved.CONCLUSION4.        I invite my colleagues -a. To take note of the need for public statements this week bythe British Railways Board and the Metropolitan Police about theircontingency plans to deal with the effects of a strike,b. To consider whether any statement should be made inParliament before the end of this week about the Governmentscontingency plans,R H j home Office18 June 19752
