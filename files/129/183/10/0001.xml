DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 60 COPY NO       g219 May 1975CABINETPUBLIC expenditure memorandum by the Prime Minister1. When the Cabinet discussed public expenditure on 10 April(CC(75) 19th Conclusions, Minute 3) I undertook to consider the arrangements which should be made in future to enable us to reach a collective view onour public expenditure strategy.2.        The full Cabinet is of course a difficult forum for discussion of a subject as technically complex and detailed as public expenditure.Nevertheless the allocation of resources is one of the Governments mostimportant decisions and necessarily involves the Cabinet,    What we need to do is to ensure two things.    The first is that the Cabinet should have theright material and enough time to consider public expenditure policy inrelation to the Governmenfs broad political and economic strategy, and inparticular what that strategy will look like when the Government approachesthe next General Election.    The second is that when specific decisions arerequired there should be as simple and coherent a presentation of the issuesfor decision as possible.    However we should achieve these aims in a way which preserves the existing public expenditure survey system and does notweaken our control of public expenditure.    Following discussion with theChancellor of the Exchequer, I set out in this note my proposals for an improved Ministerial debate on the whole question.MEDIUM TERM ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT3,        The starting point for any assessment of public expenditure is the medium Term Economic Assessment (MTA).    The MTA as such is not suitable for collective discussion by Ministers.    It would however be possible&quot;let       for the Treasury to present to Cabinet the main elements in the Medium TermAssessment (shorn of its technical jargon and apparatus) before Cabinet gotdown to substantive discussion of public expenditure programmes.    One ofthe important aspects of this presentation would be to show the effects ofdepartures - pessimistic and optimistic - from the central case: and ministers might be given an aide-memoire to take away, summarising thematerial which had been presented to them.1
ICabinet 4. This presentation would be followed by an early Cabinet discussionIfjo. 2 leading to a decision on the broad division of resources between public expenditure and private consumption, ideally incorporating some element of flexibility to allow for later changes in economic prospects.PUBLIC EXPENDITURE FIRST STAGE5.        Following discussion with Departments, the Central Policy review staff (CPRS) and Treasury would produce a paper identifying the reallymajor issues upon v/hich Cabinet might want to give political guidancebefore the public expenditure survey was put in hand.CabinetNo. 36.The aim of this would be twofold -a.To give Ministers an opportunity to discuss political options.CabinetNo. 4b.        To let them see in synoptic terms where the whole public expenditure policy was leading in terms of year 5 (or the nextElection) and in particular what might be the effect by then ofchoosing between the various options open to them.PUBLIC EXPENDITURE, SECOND STAGE7.        In the light of this political guidance, the Treasury would thenconduct the Public Expenditure Survey in such a way as to produce figuresconforming as nearly as possible both to the economic limitations flowingfrom the MTA and the priorities between programmes settled by Cabinet,New problems might arise while the Survey was being prepared, and someproblems would of course remain to be resolved when the Survey was completed.8.        On completion of the Survey the Official Steering Committee onEconomic Strategy (chaired by the Treasury at Permanent Secretary level)would prepare a memorandum for Cabinet identifying the main issues and alternative options on the programmes taking into account the guidance given at the first stage.    The Public Expenditure Survey Committee (PESC)Report would remain, as now, a background document summarising aninterdepartmentally agreed costing of all the programmes for referenceas necessary.    By interposing the new memorandum between the PESCReport and Cabinet discussion of it much of the detailed presentation which ministers currently find indigestible and confusing would be eliminated.The Chancellor would no doubt wish to make his own proposals as the basis for decisions leading up to the White Paper on public expenditure in theautumn.
TIMETABLE9,        In a normal year the sequence of events would run like this -i.January/February - Treasury submission to Cabinet of main elements of MTA following considerationby the Steering Committee on economic strategy (SCE), plus commentary byCPRS.ii.Februaryin.IV.MarchMarchlate JuneVI.Julyin light of i, decision on the broadallocation of resources between public expenditure and private consumption onthe basis of a paper by the Chancellor.in light of ii, discussion of joint CPRSand Treasury priorities paper.Chancellor&apos;s paper on launching of public expenditure Survey, designed to produce the overall limits and priorities agreed by Cabinet,submission to Cabinet of (i) a memorandum from the official Steering Committee onEconomic Strategy on the PESC report and (ii) Chancellor^ proposals.decisions by Cabinet as the basis for thepreparation of the annual White Paper.Vll,Octoberpublication of White Paper.10,       This would be a norm to which the standard run of work would begeared; but it would of course suffer disruption, if, for short-termreasons, a rapid cut in spending plans became essential.SITUATION THIS YEAR11.        This proposed procedure cannot be put into operation fully this year.No up to date version of the MTA is immediately available and the 1 billion cut announced in the Budget statement makes the figures in the january White Paper out of date (since the consequences of the 1976-77reduction for later years have yet to be worked out).    We must thereforeenter in mid-cycle but we can start injecting some of the ideas outlined above.3
12.       A possible timetable would be -i. May - launch the 1975 public expenditure survey in a form which requires Departments to produce figures on a basis approvedby the Cabinet.ii. End June - Treasury submission to Cabinet of the main elements of MTA using rough forecasts of public expenditure figures, plus commentary by CPRS.iii. July - Paper on priorities and the major options for ministers over the 5-year period prepared by the Treasury andthe CPRS.- Meeting of Ministers at Chequers to considerpriorities and strategy,iv. September - Consideration by Ministers of i. SCE paper on the Public Expenditure Survey and ii, proposals by the Chancellorfor the basis of the Public Expenditure White Paper, taking accountof the earlier discussions on the MTA and on priorities.v. November-December - Publication of Public expenditure white Paper.13.       Improvements in the system will not make our decisions morepalatable at a time when resources are scarce, but I hope my colleagues will agree that these proposals should give them a better synoptic pictureand should contribute to decisions which more closely match theGovernments overall strategy to the available resources.H W10 Downing Street19 May 1975
