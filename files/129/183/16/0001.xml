(sec ret)THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT00(75)66 COPY NO:    5 812 June 1975CABINETDEVELOPMENT OF THE SOCIAL CONTRACT ON pay memorandum by the Secretary of State for employment have pursued my private discussions with the TUC on the developmentof the pay guidelines and officials have completed the attachedexamination of the problems to be faced in applying the guidelines inthe next pay round.    I set out below my views on the problems and theline we should now take.TUC MOVES2       The TUC Economic Committee have recently agreed on the need for more widespread union commitment to the pay guidelines - keepingsettlements much closer to the rise in the cost of living and refraining from reopening settlements or basing claims on the increases given tolow paid groups and other special cases.    They have also recognised the inflationary danger of too great an increase in the low pay target for the next round.3     This expression of view is welcome.    It will help in the effortswe must continue to make to try to close this round with at least  some major settlements well under 30 per cent.    It will be useful also ininfluencing union conferences to support the social contract andrefrain from commitments to unreasonable pay demands,  an influencewe must again try to exert on the NUM Conference in July.4     The TUC staff now have to produce a draft statement of TUC policy for consideration by the Economic Committee at their meeting onII June,  endorsement by the General Council later that month andsubmission to Congress in September.    We have to make our contributionover the. next few weeks to influence the content of that document andthe attitude union leaders take towards it.PROBLEMS OF THE NEXT PAY ROUND5     In considering that contribution we must have in mind the likelypattern and problems of the next pay round. These are analysed inthe Annex in relation to the TUC guidelines. The key points are
SECRETiae RpA. ana iux ciax settlements(i) The pay round will start with the RPI 25 per cent above a year earlier.    If the initial settlements reflect this,   the links and other relationships  between groups will make it extremely difficult to get pay levels  to move down with the expected decline in the RPI  through the round.     It  seemsinconceivable that we could brock nil these links,  many ofthem re-affirmed under the Tory statutory-policy;(ii) The major public sector settlements in the Autumn forthe relatively low paid local authority manuals and NHSancillaries must therefore be kept well below the 25 per centRPI figure if that is not to become the&apos; &quot;going rate&quot;.    Thisemphasises the importance of not having the low pay targetraised above  35-36.(iii) The  &quot;maintenance of real incomes&quot; guideline will therefore need careful interpretation.    A forward lookingapproach with straight indexation for everybody on a quarterlybasis would theoretically be tne soundest arrangement and,rigorously followed,   should bring price inflation down to  isingle figures by the summer of 1976.    But it involves askingpeople to forgo any compensation for the unprecedentedly^largeprice rises since the last settlement and risks becoming Justthe floor for negotiation.    Another possibility is a specificnorm for the whole of the round,  perhaps related to the expectedaverage movement in the RPI over the period.    A 15 per cent:,norm  (or its cash or mixed cash/percentage equivalent)  should bring price inflation by the end of the next, pay round down to12-15 per centalthough there could be enormous problems in getting&apos;the early groups - to accept this when prices had risen25 per cent  since their last settlement&quot;. ^ ,.(iv) We  shall need to discourage additions to  a cost ofliving guideline in the name of productivity or restructuring,and resist reductions in hours.The Miners ^     -   ... ..(v)-   Whatever line is followed on a guideline., related to pricemovements,   there will be difficulty with particular groups.Another  &quot;special case&quot; for the miners will tend to carryelectricity and the railways with them,.and lift pay expectationsgenerally. 1 - - - - -, ;C 6 m p a r a b i 1 i t y(vi)    Then next April we  snail come  to a number of groups whoseexpectations are related not so much to prices as  to  the moveinenin other people&apos;s  earnings,  whether as a matter of procedure(eg the Civil Service and Review Body groups)  or as  the resultof having their, relativities recently re-established  (egteachers  and nurses).    The influence of comparability could also work through arbitration,  whether- in these or otner cases.2
e^sea leases \lara    I     JHigher incomes(vii)    Our decision on policy towards higher incomes,  to betaken after the  report expected in July from the Royal Commissionon the Distribution of Income and Wealth,   could affect the climate in which the new round opens.     So  too will decisions on the TSRB report on MPs&apos;  pay expected in June and on their further report on Ministers&apos;  pay expected in the Autumn.     These-decisions will of course bear on our response to the reportsdue next April from the Review Bodies.6       I propose to  discuss these problems with TUC leaders privatelyso that they will have them in mind in considering interpretation of ,the guidelines  to improve their impact on price inflation.     I doubt whether they will undertake general amendment of the guidelines andthey may maintain that the RPI difficulty requires direct action bythe Government to hold prices down.    But it is important to see whether we can get some agreed view on maintaining real incomes whichwill yield lower pay settlements:     to keep the low pay target  to 35/36;     to urge and  assist the TUC to secure more general and firmsupport for the guidelines witnin the movement;     and to  get theGeneral  Council to  exert more concerted influence in advance of keypay negotiations like the miners.GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT.      &apos;  . -     -7       I understand that the CBI may put to us,  after their council meeting on; 21 May,   a proposal that the Government should sponsor,   inconjunction with the TUC and CBI,   the development of a three year,voluntary policy to  extinguish inflation.    Their ideas may wellencompass a norm for the next pay round linked to a price inflationtarget,  with detailed guidance and arrangements for monitoring andperiodic review.8       A central agreement of this kind would theoretically be highly ,!desirable,, but it is  evident from the TUC1 s position with its membership that it would not want the added difficulty of association with the employers&apos;  organisation in a policy of pay restraint.Nonetheless,  I  do not think that we can just leave the voluntarypolicy to  the TUC in the next round and there are elements in the cbi approach which the;Government might pick up,  both through itsresponsibility for the management of the economy and in its-rolesas employer and as financier of the public sector. -9       Under the first head,   there might be  a case for issuing this summer a public statement of the Government&apos; s view of where the TUCsPay guidelines, could lead us  economically over the next year.     this might possibly encosipass announcement of a price inflation target for the next round to which the TUC guidelines would be relatedwithin the context of the  expected development of the economy,spelling out the consequences  if the guidelines are not respected.This would support the guidelines by providing an explicit Governmentview of the social and economic importance of compliance to which   !&apos;union leaders,   employers  and people generally could attach themselves.3 . &apos;. .    &apos;
10      Under the second head, we might state in advance that tneGovernment will not automatically subsidise excessive-pay increases in the public  sector,   including the public  services.     I recognise the risks  that we recently discussed  (EC(75)?th Meeting Minutes),but some risk of conflict  is unfortunately inherent in any attemptto get. firm adherence to  an incomes policy.    If we maintain a voluntary policy on the present  linos,   the  consequences of itsbreath must be  seen to come home to roost in the public sector.The consequences may well be extremely awkward in particular cases,but it is  the most  direct  expression,  both for the workforce andfor the public  generally,   of  the ineluctable relationship betweenexcessive pay increases and the level of prices,   employment and services.11      If my colleagues agree,   I think we should sound the TUCprivately on both these ideas for reinforcement of. their guidelines..THE PROSPECTS OF SUCCESS12      There is opposition within the union movement  to  any restraint on pay even within  the context of the social contract  and we cannotlook at the moment for more than a majority endorsement even of theexisting guidelines at Congress  in September.     On the other hand.,there is  also  evident concern among union leaders about the need to bring down the rate of pay increases.     This  is plain,  for instance in the TGWU suggestion of a flat rate cash increase for everybody inthe next round.    Whether this would help or not obviously depends onthe figure and whether it becomes a limit or a floor..  And the wholeconcept may founder on opposition from.: those union groups who .arealready seeking to  reverse the compression of percentage differen-tials in recent years,  notably by the  ^100 threshold payments.    Butthe open discussion of a specific pay limit represents a departurein TUC thinking Which may open the way to  a tighter interpretationand application of the guidelines.13      I am.sure that we must try to get  that and,  in my view,   it will need both a greater commitment by the TUC to influence individual cases and a supporting involvement by the Government on .tiie above lines.    Even so,   there can be no assurance that  tne guidelines will...succeed in the next round:     the  context will be  easier than lastyear to the  extent that statutory anomalies will have been removed,but harder to  the extent  that price inflation will bo half as highagain and people will have become accustomed to  pay increases  inthe region of 30 per cent,l&apos;i Under the current guidelines we might still expect earnings torise by nearly 25 per I&quot; cent between July 1975 and the summer of 19?6but&apos;the rate of price increases to ease off from 25 per cent in thethird quarter of 1975 to&apos; something in the region of 15-17 per cent ,by the summer of 1976.,, In discussing the next round&apos;s problems with the TUC, I would be looking for an application of the guidelineswhich would offer an improvement on that.
[ COULD WE DO BETTER?15     Much more ambitious targets  can be set,  but I  doubt whetherthey could be held for long,   involving as they would a sharp    -reduction in real incomes *    What  can be achieved through incomes policy is limited largely by what would secure the acquiescence,open or tacit,   of union membership.l6     To my mind these considerations rule out the obvious otheroptions :(i) At  one  extreme  lies abandonment of an open incomes policyin favour of a covert de-escalation line of the Tory kind in1970-72*.    Whatever that has to commend it in terms of relievingresponsible union leadership from tne risk of being outflankedin defence of a voluntary pay policy,   it would to my mind be quite indefensible for vis . as a Government and appear as anabdication of the social contract approach.,    It must be doubt-ful whether other public1 sector employers would put up withcovert pressures that they would regard as discriminatory.(ii) A much tougher voluntary policy is not available fromthe TUC and tougher guidelines advanced by the Government alone would have no better chance of voluntary acceptance,    The TUCwould be bound to disown them in favour of its own and we wouldbe left treading this voluntary path with employers&apos; and,   even so,   subject to charges of public sector discrimination.  :(iii) Even if we were minded to repeat past mistakes byre-introducing statutory pay controls,, they, could prove short-lived in the face of the same resistance that the TUC guidelinesare meeting.     Indeed,   that resistance might be all the keener to statutory controls which would inevitably be  cutting real incomesdrastically over the next year,,    Broken statutory controls would leave us with an even worse position beyond,CONCLUSIONS17     The most viable policy is still that offered by co-operationwith the TUC.    Unless we can reach agreement with them on a commonapproach in development of their guidelines,   they will stumble intoCongress with a view increasingly divergent from Government and ingrave danger of a fragmentation of union opinion which will prevent any united TUC view emerging at  all.    That will give us  an evenweaker position in txio next pay round than we have had in this.18     In my view the most promising line is(i)    for me to continue private discussions with TUC leadersso as to influence  the statement on guidelines which emergesfrom the  June  Economic  Committee,     I  shall put  to  them theproblems of the next round as we see them and. urge them toconsider means by which these problems  can be tackled;     explore the possibilities of interpreting the cost of living guidelineso as to keep down the level of initial  settlements,  or of replacing it by a specific:figure;     and make plain theGovernment&apos;s need for firmer adherence in  the  next  round andfor results compatible with our economic requirements;
(ii) We  should have an open discussion with the TUC - a   .&quot;meeting with the Economic Committee or the NEDC 6 -  about thesocial  contract and the relationship of pay to our otherpolicies  in order to influence the generality of union leader-ship to  support the guidelines when the policy statement.goestq  the General  Council   towards  the  end of June;(iii) We should be ready to meet  the CBI  similarly if theyput forward their own stabilisation programme.    We couldwelcome their counter inflation aims  and support for the voluntary approach,  but without commitment to attempting a tripartite pay policy; * &apos;; (iv)    Subject to  such meetings  and consultation with the TUC,we should consider a Government pronouncement/White Paper inJune/July on pay,   prices  and economic prospects along the  linesof paragraph 9  above.     This would, establish a clear and positive Government position,   including the Government attitude to  the financing of any excessive pay increases in tne public sector in the next round.     Such n * pronouncement might follow&apos;a discussion in NEDC at  the beginning of July of the general economic  situation and prospects over the next year wnich:,.would to  some extent meet the  CBI position and pick up thePrime Minister&apos;s recent suggestion that the three parties;. ; ,should come together to  consider problems of economic management,annually and to review them periodically.    :19      I invite my colleagues  to  endorse this approach.    Meanwhile,  Ishall pursue my private  discussions with the TUC on the  lines  s:etout ..above.  . We . can consider our position again in the light of -thepolicy document that  emerges from the Economic  Committee in mid- :June.    Officials should meanwhile be asked to. consider the content of a possible Government pronouncement as a setting for a firmapplication of the guidelines in the next round.M department ox Employment SV7212 June 19756
Report by the Department  of EmploymentSummary and conclusions      This  report,  prepared by the Department of Employment withthe assistance of officials of the other Departments mainly concerned,   looks at the probable course of the next pay round onthe assumption that the- TUC guidelines are maintained.    following are the main points which emerge.Remainder of this Round2   *&apos; Up to the end of July,  assuming no major Industrial or economic crisis,  i?.o significant change is  expected in the  general pattern of pay settlements.    The year-on-year RPI increase isexpected to  jump to over 23 per cent with the May figure published in mid-Utuae,and to go higher still in mid-July.    The year-on-yearwage, rate figure is likely to remain over 30 per cent,  mainly because of the implementation in May of the first stage of the1975 national engineering agreement,   initially offsetting the gradual elimination of Stage 3 threshold payments from the figuresover the coming months.    The year-on-year average earnings figure is likely to continue in the high 20s.3      Several important groups will be reaching settlements(including arbitrations)  of around 30 per cent or more eg electrical -cal power engineers,  merchant seamen,   the  industrial Civil Serviceand probalOy railways.    There is still likely however to be a&apos;wide range in the level of settlements with some important groups suchas local authority non-manuals,  British Steel manuals,  the chemical industry and some Post Office groups in the mid-20s and somesmaller groups at lower figures.- i iRe-opening of Existing Settlementsk     The postmen&apos;s new threshold will almost certainly be triggeredin June and monthly thereafter.    London Transport workers will receive the  first payment under their quarterly indexing arrange-ment in July.    There will be increasing pressure over the coming months for similar threshold arrangements or other forms  of re-opening of existing settlements on cost of living grounds by thecoalminers,   firemen,   local authority manual workers,  NHS  ancillariesand others.    The present  line is that such pressures  for re-openingshould be resisted,   certainly until prices have eroded the  total value of the  existing settlement.-7-THE PAY PROSPECT IN THE NEXT ROUND
Higher Incomes5      Ministers are due to take decisions later this summer,in the light of the report expected in July from the BoyalCommission 021 the Distribution of Income and Wealth,  on theirpolicy on higher incomes generally.    These decisions  could havean important influence on the climate in which the initialnegotiations in the hew round take place.     So too  could decisions on the report on the pay and allowances of Members of parliament which.&apos;is  expected from the Top Salaries Review Body in June andtheir fur her report on ministers  pay,  Peers&apos;  allowances,  and members&apos;   pensions  expected in the autumn..Early Settlements in the New Round6    Apart  from police,  who are already near a settlement in thehigh 20s  for implementation on 1 September,  and any unpredic**table happenings similar to the -40 per cent Scottish road ihaulagesettlement  last autumn,   the first major group to settle in thenew round will be the local authority manuals,  with effect ;from1 November.    This settlement effectively sets the level-for theopening stages of the round through the direct link with NHS__vancillaries and its  effect on the    water supply and gas industrieswho last year insisted on maintaining their traditional.   &apos;&apos;relativity,   in breach of the, guidelines,  and would undoubtedlydo so again. --     - -7      On present form the local authority manuals are unlikely tosettle much below 30 pe^ cent.    &quot;Depending on the extent to whichthe TUC ?.r;ir pay target of  30 is revised by Congress in September,it could be higher.-.   This is because they will be negotiatingagainst the year-on-year RPI figure of over 25 per cent.     Theyare very unlikely to offset that  element which arises from the april Budget  increases.     On top of t-his will be the probable3 to 4 per cent cost&apos; of&quot;their restructuring claim which is atpresent at arbitration.8      This group contains many at or near the TUC target minimum rate of  30 per week,   and they will expect to he kept in line witiiany revision of it.    If the target were revised merely in line with price inflation,  ie to.&apos; 35/ 36,  no extra cost would be involved,     But Congress may decide to go for a round  figure of 40,  as keeping pace with the rise in the general level of earningFor the local authority manuals  to meet this and maintain, above itthe newly-established differentials for higher grades,  would addanother 5&quot;or 6 per cent,    This too would feed through to the;r elated, groups..... ;. &apos;SECRET    &quot;
9      There may also be pressure at Congress to reaffirm resolutionscarried in earlier years calling for a general reduction in hoursbelow 40,   as a means of work sharing.    Though this  could for manygroups be conceded without loss of output in current economic circumstances,   each hour1s reduction would add some k per cent to labour costs when the revival of economic activity necessitatedmaking good, the  reduction-by working overtime at premium rates.Coalminers10    The high settlement level set by the local authority manualsand related groups would be likely,  as  this year,   to be givenfresh impetus by negotiations  for coalminers.    They could indeedbring themselves into the early part of the round,   particularly if they fail to get a new threshold arrangement in the inteiim,by pressing for the November settlement date to which Wilberforcein 1972 suggested they could return.    This might not much reducethe level of the  settlement and the annual rate would be very high.If they are held to March, it seems- very unlikely,   despite the .first signs of the hoped-for decline in the year-on-year RPIfigure which should by then be coming apparent,  that they will accept a settlement much lower than they have achieved in each ofthe last 2 years,   ie in excess of 30 per cent.    This will undoubtedly be followed in electricity supply (also taking theircue partly from the  gas manuals!and there will be strong pressuresfor a similar settlement on the railways.&apos;White Collar groups settling in April11    In April there would be settlements for a number of very largewhite collar groups,  all of whose claims will be based less onthe RPI than on comparability.    These include the non-industrial civil Service,  the  groups covered by the Review Bodies,  and teachers  and nurses who will be seeking to maintain the relative,positions  established by the Halsbury and Houghton reviews.Since the analogues and indices with which they are drawing theircomparisons will be those established in the latter part of thecurrent round a level of settlement in the high 20s is to beexpected. .    it ^Other Groups - &apos;12    Other groups settling in the latter part of the round,including local negotiations  in engineering and construction&apos;within their long term national agreements,  may be more influenced by. the continued reduction in the year-on-year RPI figure,  and perhaps by the high level of unemployment.    But it seems  likely that the high levels of settlement for the  earlier groups will tendto keep the  general level of expectations higher than would bewarranted on a strict cost of living approach.    Others besides  localauthority manuals will claim rest rue t uring to restore differentialseroded by flat cash increases in earlier rounds.    Claims  for additional efficiency payments may be pressed, more than in thisround as  cost cif living becomes a  less  obvious justification,  yet the prospects of getting real, improvements in output per man hourin conditions of heavy unemployment cannot be rated high.
SECRETConclusions13.    The key problems likely to arise in the next round undercontinuation of existing policies are:-- the high year-on-year RPI figures against which negotiationswill be taking place in tho third and fourth quarters of 1975- the danger that Congress will raise the TUC low pay targetby an even higher percentage,   to say i,kO,  and thatdifferentials will be maintained above this figure;- pressures at Congress for general    reduction in work, hoursbelow 40 as a means of &quot;work sharing&quot;- claims for additional increases on grounds of productivityor structuring;- the extent to which levels of settlement set early in the round will be perpetuated by determination to preserveexisting links and relativities between groups,   h a c  by thegeneral concept of the &quot;going rate&quot;,  with arbitration as apossible mechanism;- the effect on the negotiating -climate through the autumn and winter of negotiations for coalminers and the directeffect of their settlement on electricity workers andrailwaymen;- the large groups of white collar workers due for settlements in April on the basis of more or less precisely &quot;defined tcomparability;- pressures for a more active role by Government and/or by the tuc and the CBI in monitoring negotiations and settlements,and exerting pressure to secure a higher degree of conformitywith the policy.The following paragraphs set out the options for handling these problems within the framework of existing policy.i    Initially High RPI LevelsIk,    The problem will be to persuade those  settling early in the newround to accept less than full compensation for the increases inprices which have occurred since their last settlement  (other thanoff-setting any interim cost of living compensation which they mayhave received).    The solution offering the most rapid reduction inthe rate of inflation  (short of an absolute freeze)  is undoubtedlystraight indexation,  io  settlements giving no immediate increase in pay but providing for eg quarterly increases in line with subsequentprice increases.     This  can be presented as in line with the TUC&apos;s&quot;alternative approach&quot; under the cost of living guideline.    But, as experience with that approach in this round shows,  indexation is unlikely to be acceptable to negotiators under a voluntary poliqyunless it is on top of compensation for the price increases whichhave already occurred since the last settlement,  which is      themost expensive. solution of all,    1-soreovor there are longer-termdangers in getting indexed increases as a permanent arrangement,with negotiated increases  subsequently on top.
egret;15.    Another option,  with a better chance of acceptance though stilldifficult,  would be a fixed norm at something less than the goingrate of increase in the RPI - say 15 per cent.    It would be possibleto provide a cash under-pinning,  of say  7.50, which would providefull price  compensation for those on  30 or less,   or a cash normalone.    But these cash variants pose difficulties,   first because in many cases differentials -will undoubtedly be maintained  (or sooner or later restored)  on top of the cash figure and secondly becausethe cash figure would give more than full compensation to thosesettling later in the round against lower RPI figures,16.    It would be difficult to persuade people to take a 15 per cent,increase in pay after 25 per cent increase in prices.    It might be presented as the best way of maintaining real incomes in the longrun,  through the eventual benefit to prices.    But to support this itmight be necessary to underwrite the expected fall in the rate of price increases by conceding new threshold arrangements to betriggered if prices rose by more than 15 per cent during the currency of the particular settlement.    While any threshold arrangement is ahostage to  economic, fortune,   and to some extent pre-empts the scope for negotiation in the following round,   arrangements of this kind,,at a suitably high figure and related to individual settlement datesand with compensation on a percentage basis,  would be much lessinflationary or distorting to the normal pattern of negotiation and differentials than the Stage 3 threshold arrangements. -   -17.    An alternative to thresholds as an additional &quot;sweetner&quot; to a fixed norm of around 15 per cent,  but more costly,  would be astaged settlement providing for a specified further increasewithin less than 12 months.    Unlike thresholds this would have tobe paid even though the hoped-for reduction in the rate of price increase were achieved,  and it would create higher expectationsfor the next round.ii&apos; ,&apos;: Low&apos; Pay &quot;18.    It will bo essential to resist the raising of the low pay:target from  30 to  40 since maintenance of differentials andrelativities would raj)idly establish    this 33? increase as theGeneral &quot;going rate&quot;.    If Congress were  to adopt it,   then theGovernment would have to emphasise in stronger terms than .last year that it represented a target and indicate that progressin the next round should be limited to keeping pace with, theincrease in the RPI or  (if this were adopted)  the 15 per cent norm.Since relation to  the RPI would produce different figures forgroups settling at different times it. would, in any case be better for the TUC (or if necessary the Government)  to specify the newtarget as  35  (an increase of just under 17 per cent).iii    hours19o    It is possible that Congress may re-affirm existingresolutions calling for negotiations toward the general introductionof a 35 hour week.    Hie Government will wish to discourage suchmoves.    If this target is re-affirmed they might take a similarline to that  suggested above on low pay indicating that in theGovernment&apos;s view progress in this round should be limited to bringing those  few groups whoso hours are still over k.0 down tothis figure.
(iv)  Productivity and restructuring20.    The lower the level of the norm,  whatever its form,   the greatethe pressure for- additional increases on grounds of restructuring(especially to restore cifferentials)  or productivity.Productivity deals can be highly inflationary,   even if self-financing in tlie long term,   because of repercussions on other groups and should therefore not be generally encouraged as aiaeansof getting extra pay.C-v)  Links and Rj?.ativities and the Role of Arbitration21. . Experience in the current round,   and indeed over many years,shows that any general move to break existing links and relativitieis unlikely to be successful.    These and more generalisedcomparability arguments might well be sustained if pressed to arbitration.    Rather than attempt to break such links as would berequired by de-escalating the level of settlements through the round in line with the hoped-for reduction in the rate of price increase,   it seems better to seek to avoid these problems by establishing an acceptable general norm which can be applied   \throughout the round.22-    There has lately been a move to arbitration in important caseslike the railways,   teachers and the local authority manuals  -restructuring claim.    There may be greater recourse to arbitration in the next round,  particularly if the current arbitrationssatisfy the unions.    This could pose awkward problems in the public sector if the Government were seeking to resist settlements abovethe cost of living.or a fixed norm,   eg by applying.financialsanctions.(vi) Miners23.     There is a considerable risk that any success in starting offthe round at air acceptably low going rate of settlement, would be seriously damaged by a high settlement for coalminers,  whether ,inthe autumn or early in 1976.    It would inevitably extend toelectricity workers and probably to railwaymen and to a lesser.extent other groups.     The options are either to resist a high .claim,  making the.most of the progress achieved by miners over -thepast 3 or 4&quot;. years with the resulting erosion of the competitiveadvantage of ccri ever oil even at the new prices;  or to seek.insome way to isolate miners as a special case.    This would meanpreventing the flow through to electricity workers,  which scarcelyseems possible,   or to railwayman.(vii) White Collar Comparability in April  ,.2k.    After the miners,   the next threat to maintenance of a lower,rgoing rate&quot;  established earlier in the round would be  the  claims,based to a greater or lesser extent on comparability,   for thelarge white collar groups settling in April.     These include thenon-industrial Civil Service  (PRU),  nurses  (referring back toKalsbury),   teachers  (referring back to Houghton)  and those coveredby the Review Bodies.    Again the options are to seek to isolatesuch groups by general recognition that the procedures involvedrepresent fair &quot;catching up&quot; -on increases already guinea bySECRET
analogous workers,  or to limit the increases payable in thenext round to the general norm.    Apart from the obvious dangers of industrial action in the latter course it builds up a debitbalance which creates greater difficulties next time round.     (Thehigher income groups covered by the Review&apos; Bodies would of. course be subject to Government decisions on higher incomes generally to be reached in the light of the report expected from the RoyalCommission tiiis July).(viji )_Monitoring25      It is becoming difficult for the Government to refuse to give information about the &quot;going rate&quot;  of settlements of which it hasknowledge.    In fact its information is fairly extensive though not entirely representative.     It is for consideration whether theGovernment,   or conceivably the TUC and CBI,   should openly undertakemonitoring of all settlements covering 1,000 or more workers on a voluntary oasis and be prepared to make public a running tally fromtime  to  time of the level of settlements and any special features.It would,  however,  remain inappropriate for the Government - tocategorise, settlements as  to those within or without the ,guidelineslaid down by the TUC.    The main argument against a more openmonitoring system is the increased pressure to which it gives riseon the Government  (or for that matter on the TUC and the CBI)  tomake  this categorisation and to take action in cases where thepolicy has been blatantly disregarded.    The indications are that neither the TUC nor the CBI would welcome this role either- for themselves or  (in the case of the TUC)  for the Government.1&apos;-&apos;
