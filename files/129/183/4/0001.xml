OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT0 oC(75) 54 COPY NO        028 April 1975CABINETEXPORT OF ARMS SPARES FOR SOUTH africa memorandum by the Lord President of the council. In his memorandum C(75) 47 the Secretary of State for Trade seeksagreement to proposals for bringing to an end the supply to South Africa of spare parts for weapons,,    My colleagues will wish to be aware of thediscussions of this subject by the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee, atthe last of which I took the chair in the absence of the Prime Minister.2.        The conclusion reached by the Committee on 14 November 1974 wasthat in principle we should be prepared to contiaue the policy of supplyingspare parts to South Africa but that if the contractual position in any     1particular case was such as to show that an exception should or could properly be made to this general principle, the Committee should considerit.    At a further discussion, on 21 March, the majority of the Committeereaffirmed that conclusion after considering proposals by the Secretary ofState for Trade, the effect of which would have been in their viewsubstantially to modify it.    The Secretary of State for Trade challenges thispolicy on the grounds set out in paragraph 5 of C(75) 47; and he proposesaction to phase out the supply of spares, which he considers will be under-stood as a consistent and defensible development of our publicly statedpolicies towards South Africa and will not provoke harmful reactions on our defence sales to other countries or on our civil trade with South Africa.3. The majority in the Committee were led to their conclusion by adifferent assessment of these matters.    They considered that the courseadvocated by the Secretary of State for Trade would represent a markedhardening of our policy, which could lead to substantial difficulties andendanger our interests over a wide area.    The withholding of spare partsw*uld be severely damaging to the South African defence forces and could lead to retaliation by South Africa against our non-military exports.    Adecision to withhold spares necessary to maintain equipment alreadysupplied would be noted by other countries and could damage our reputationworld wide as a supplier of defence equipment.    We were not underpressure from the African countries to tighten our restrictions on arms supplies to South Africa still further.    Mr Vorster!s efforts to obtain a&quot;  &apos;MET
SECRETsettlement in Rhodesia had led to an improvement in South Africa&apos;relations with her neighbours.    Our own relationship with South Africa,though formally correct rather than cordialt was producing some usefulresults and would not be assisted if a new irritant were now introduced;nor would our relations with South Africa&apos;s neighbours be helped.    The viewof the majority was clear;  the case had not been made for changing ourpolic/ in the direction desired by the Secretary of State for Trade, and onthe contrary our political and commercial interests in Africa and elsewherewould not be served by such a change.E privy Council Office28 April 1975
