INTRODUCTION BY THE PRIME MINISTER,THE RT HON HAROLD WILSON, OBE, FRS, MPAt the meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Government at Kingston,Jamaica on 1 May 1975, I put forward suggestions for a general agreement on commodities. The text of my statement at that meeting, together witha memorandum by the United Kingdom Delegation analysing the back-ground, describing the problems of world trade in commodities, and setting out the proposals I tabled at the meeting, are published together in this paper.
SPEECH BY THE PRIME minister the RT HON HAROLD WILSON, OBE, FRS, MP,AT THE COMMONWEALTH HEADS OF GOVERNMENTMEETING, KINGSTON, JAMAICA, 1 MAY 1975All of us here have long recognised the need for economic interdepend-ence in our trade and dealings with one another, and in the wider world.Over generations, failure to make this interdependence a reality has beenthe cause of great suffering, suffering above all for developing countriesproducing the food and raw materials the world needs, without a fair andassured return.If any doubt remained about the need for interdependence surely thishas been dispelled by the events of these past few years.We have all been affected. But by far the hardest hit of all are thosedeveloping countries whose pattern of exports denies them any chance ofprofiting by the boom in commodity prices, while at the same time theyhave had to pay a lot more for all their essential imports, especially oiland food, fertilisers and feeding stuffs. Most tragic of all has been the effecton nations already facing starvation starvation aggravated in some casesby drought and others by flood who have then found their resourcesstrained beyond endurance to pay the increased cost of the things they need.I want to make it clear in what I propose today that the British Govern-ment fully accept that the relationship, the balance, between the rich andpoor countries of the world is wrong and must be remedied. That is theprinciple on which my proposals rest: that the wealth of the world mustbe redistributed in favour of the poverty stricken and the starving. Thismeans a new deal in world economies, in trade between nations and theterms of that trade.I believe that this can be done. But it is fundamental that there shouldbe more wealth more wealth to be shared more equitably. Shared moreequitably, as you said, Mr. Chairman in your welcoming address, withinnations: but shared more equitably between nations and peoples.How we fulfil that objective, by what measures or armoury of measures,we can decide. There are many means by which we can reach that end:but they are only mechanisms. Our dedication must be to the principle, andour determination to achieve it, is unshakeable.My own concern and involvement with the problems of commoditytrade is lifelong, but what is new is the extent of instability in food andraw material prices. Following the Korean War, which caused great dis-turbance, there was a long period of relative calm. But recently circum-stances have been more difficult than at any time since the 1930s.Fluctuations in prices have been violent and sudden.I would identify three reasons for these fluctuations:First, variations in demand. In the last few years demand in the industrial-ised countries for the products of other countries has moved up and down
more or less in step. The rise and fall has been greater than in the past and might well be even greater in the future. No-one, but no-one, has avested interest in this sort of boom and bust. Commodity producing countries who gain from scarcity prices for a time, often find that inflationis generated in their countries, which causes great social hardship whenthe boom ends.Second, variations in supply. There has been widespread disruptionparticularly from crop failures. The harvests of 1972 and 1974 were bad,as Mrs. Gandhi reminded us yesterday. These bring disastrous consequences,above all for the poorest. Even now world food stocks are very low.Third, of course, oil. The world economy as a whole suffered a sharp andunique jolt with the rise in oil prices.These events underline one of the historic canons of one of the world&apos;sgreat religions, that &quot;we are all members one of another&quot;.Everything that has happened in these past two or three years demon-strates the vested interest of all of us in a one-world system for commoditytrade. We shall make no progress unless we recognise that large andsudden variations in price, not to mention uncertainty over supply andmarkets, are disadvantageous to both developed and developing countriesalike. Both have a common interest in avoiding them.The costs for the developed countries as consumers are a worsening oftheir inflation, setting up a ratchet mechanism of inflation as wages reactup but not down: an extra burden on their balance of payments: and uncertainty over the long-term development of their sources of supply.Britain&apos;s own balance of payments in 1974 had to carry an extra chargeof  2,500 million by the rise in prices of oil and commodity price increasesover the past year represent a surcharge on every family in the country of4 per cent of their household income. But developed countries do not gainall that much when commodity prices fall. They might hope for an im-provement in their price level, but this does not always occur, particularly if the previous price inflation has generated a spiral of internal cost increases,wage and price increases. They might secure a temporary easement to theirbalance of payments, but it is only temporary, because one inevitable result is the impoverishment of their primary producing customers who have to cut down their imports of manufactured and other goods whether capital goods or consumer products. And this increases unemployment.Before the War Sir William Beveridge and I produced evidence that every industrial slump in Britain, every increase in unemployment for theprevious 100 years, was associated with a collapse in primary prices inthe countries from whom we imported much food and materials.And turning to developing countries, boom conditions can lead to ex-sucessive production and over-investment in capacity which may then proveuneconomic. In slump conditions while some developing countries sufferonly from setbacks to their development plans, for many others it meansmalnutrition, even starvation. Less advanced countries depend criticallyon the ratio between their exports and imports of high-priced commodities.And, again I repeat, those developing countries who neither producetheir own energy needs nor raw materials for export suffer most whether in boom or slump. Especially those in absolute poverty.What this analysis means, I can sum up in these terms.
We all have a common interest in reducing the violent fluctuations incommodity prices.We must recognise the importance to developing countries of increasing their income from commodity exports.The context for achieving these objectives must be an orderly and sus-tained expansion of world trade. Without this our joint efforts to bringorder into trade in commodities will be frustrated.Going back a little, the war released a new idealism and new intellectualresources. Bretton Woods, the work on the Havana Charter, which becamepermanent in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and the crea-tion of the Food and Agriculture Organisation all brought forth a newsense of urgency. I was fortunate to have spent one of the most excitingperiods of my life being involved with this. In 1946 my Prime Minister,Attlee, sent me as a young Minister to head the British Delegation to theFAO preparatory Commission. Sixteen nations were selected by FAO toprepare guidelines for the new organisation under two heads primaryproduction, particularly in developing countries, and commodity policy.Our report created a great deal of interest at that time but little action.What we did do was to draft the guidelines for the new post-war international wheat agreement, for sugar and to seek to turn the pre-war producer cartels,tin and others, into genuine commodity agreements.Under the then laissez-faire leadership of the United States, nations werecontent to make important decisions about tariffs, about freeing trade,and, through GATT, above all to lay down ground rules to prevent escap-ism by individual nations into autarky and into nationalistic measures harm-ful to their neighbours and tp world trade in general. But the samephilosophy proved allergic to vigorous action on commodities.It was for that reason that my own Department, the Board of Trade,in 1951 took the lead in establishing the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement,a model of its kind, which has been of benefit to producer and consumercountries alike. One of my most savage criticisms of the terms on which britain entered the European Common Market in 1971 was the acceptanceof conditions which meant the ending of the Commonwealth Sugar Agree-ment. I am glad to feel that in Britain&apos;s renegotiations with the Community,we have at last got agreement to the guaranteed continuing import of the1,400,000 tons of Commonwealth cane sugar into the Community, and itwill go mainly to Britain. But for close on a quarter of a century on com-commodity markets, it has been &quot;too much talk, and not enough do&quot;.Each commodity poses a special problem. Each commodity has its ownelasticity of demand, its own production cycle and its own special problemsover storage. There is no general panacea. At the same time those who are changed with negotiating arrangements for trade in a particular commoditycan assuredly benefit from adopting a common approach based on mutualundertakings and relevant mechanisms, some at least of which they might find appropriate to the issues they are seeking to resolve.I want to say a word at this point I am not running away from it about proposals for indexation, for which many developing countries are pressing namely the introduction of some form of indexation of com-commodity prices linked to the price of manufactured goods which developing countries import with the proceeds from their primary exports.

At the same time those who are changed with negotiating arrangements for trade in a particular commoditycan assuredly benefit from adopting a common approach based on mutualundertakings and relevant mechanisms, some at least of which they might find appropriate to the issues they are seeking to resolve.I want to say a word at this point I am not running away from it about proposals for indexation, for which many developing countries are pressing namely the introduction of some form of indexation of com-commodity prices linked to the price of manufactured goods which developing countries import with the proceeds from their primary exports.
This must certainly be looked at. It has been pressed by oil-producing countries, where technically its operation might be relatively simple, not least because there is basically one price for oil. Here the different startingpoints of producer and consumer countries are concerned with what dateyou choose whether it is a peak oil price date, for example, whether youtake the peak price or a figure so many percentage points behind it, or ifyou take the existing price whether you have a delay mechanism of a year or two or more before indexation begins to operate. In the case of generalcommodities the problems provide greater technical difficulties.There is a problem of the starting date, the reference date. But not allcommodities peak at the same time, or behave in a similar fashion follow-ing their respective peaks. Sugar producers, Mr. Chairman, might like totake a date round about the latter months of last year when sugar was at its peak. I am not sure that President Kaunda would like to choose the same date in respect of copper, because by that date copper prices had fallenback to the 1970 levels, as though the commodity boom had never happened.So you have the problem of a common date for composite materials. I doubt whether it would be possible and importing countries might not feel itdesirable to have an indexation based on a series of base points, eachreflecting the peak points of individual commodities. And if you had, a sudden upsurge in one commodity price, or a catastrophic fall in another,would probably not be acceptable to the developing producer countries, sincethe benefit would be sharply differentiated, and might not be a generalbenefit at all. So if indexation is to be examined, as I concede it must, threeconsiderations follow:(1) We should take full account of the different kinds of indexationwhich are possible. Many&apos; countries, including oil producers, aretalking about an index related to the cost of the goods they import rather like a cost of living provision in a wages contract in ourdomestic economies. But in your own case, Mr. Chairman, themethods you have adopted ensure that bauxite prices bear a fixedrelation, not to import costs, but to the selling price of the finished aluminium.(2) We have to recognise that indexation can bear very unequally asbetween the producer participants to a scheme, as well as to theconsumer countries involved, and(3) We must not let the technical difficulties of indexation, which may take considerable time to iron out, deflect us from the urgent necessity of examining the other proposals which I now want toput forward in my six-point plan, together with other proposalswhich might emerge from an examination of them.Responding, Mr. Chairman, to the challenge which you have placed before this Conference I now wish to place the British Governments views before you.Any attempt to bring order to the key area of trade in commodities byfollowing the approach I have outlined must build on the common interestsof developed and developing countries. I believe that this common groundcan be translated into a set of general commitments which would be com-plemented by specific proposals for action.
What the British Government have in mind is that we set as our objectivea general agreement on commodities, not only for ourselves but for thewhole world.A generation after the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, I believe the time has come to balance it with a general agreement on commodities-it is long overdue.As a basis for discussion, I suggest that the following commitmentsmight form part of a general agreement.First, we should recognise the interdependence of producers and con-sumers and the desirability of conducting trade in commodities in accord-ance with equitable arrangements worked out in agreement between pro-ducers and consumers.Second, producer countries should undertake to maintain adequate and secure supplies to consumer countries.Third, consumer countries for their part should undertake to improveaccess to markets for those items of primary production of interest to developing producers.Fourth, the principle should be established that commodity prices shouldbe equitable to consumers and remunerative to efficient producers and ata level which would encourage longer-term equilibrium between productionand consumption.Fifth, we should recognise in particular the need to expand the total production of essential foodstuffs.. Sixth, we should aim to encourage the efficient development productionand marketing of commodities (both mineral and agricultural) and I should like to emphasise forest products and the diversification and efficient pro-cessing of commodities in developing countries. We should not deduce from two centuries of history that there was any divine ordinance at the creationof the world under which providence deposited the means to primary produc-tion in certain countries and it was ordained that those minerals, or other products should be exclusively or mainly processed in other countries.In saying this I repeat that in any general agreement or other means to advance, we must lay heavy emphasis on the special needs of the poorest countries.Now in practical terms, if we are to give specific content to these generalcommitments, specific action is called for. This action should, in my viewmust, include measures directed to the following ends:(1) To establish better exchanges of information on forward supplyand demand.(2) To elaborate more specific rules to define the circumstances underwhich import and export restrictions may be applied to commodities-ties.(3) To encourage the development of producer/consumer associationsfor individual commodities.(4) To give fresh impetus to the joint efforts of producers and con-sumers to conclude commodity agreements designed to facilitate the orderly conduct and development of trade. This could be doneFirst, by identifying commodities appropriate to the con-clusion of such agreements;
Second, by analysing commodity by commodity the appropriate-ate mechanisms for the regulation of trade within the frame-work of such agreements (including international buffer stocks,co-ordination of nationally held stocks, production controlsand export quotas);Third, by examining ways in which any financial burden arisingfrom these mechanisms may be appropriately financed.(5) To agree that the regulatory mechanisms incorporated in any international commodity agreement would be directed towards themaintenance of market prices within a range negotiated in accord-ance with the principles enshrined in the fourth general commit-ment.(6) To establish the framework of a scheme for the stabilisation of export earnings from commodities.These proposals will obviously need detailed study. There are already in prospect negotiations on a number of individual commodities includingcoffee, cocoa, tin and wheat. The United Kingdom has always belonged toprevious commodity agreements and we shall play our part in the negotia-tions for these new agreements. Commodities will also be an importantsubject in the multilateral trade negotiations which are now getting underway and the European Community has stressed in its mandate for these negotiations its intention to take account of the interests and the problemsof the developing countries and in particular of the least developed in allsectors of the negotiations. :Some commodities are of special if not exclusive importance to Common-wealth producers, tea and jute, for example which have not shared in therecent commodity boom. Can we agree to tackle the problems of these commodities as a matter of urgency?As my colleagues will see, in my specific proposals I have suggested thatwe look afresh at the possibilities for reducing price fluctuations. This couldbe done either through internationally held buffer stocks or through co-ordination of national buffer stocks, and you won&apos;t find that the answer that is right for one commodity is right for another. At the same time my proposals recognise that commodities produced by the poorest countries arenot on the whole susceptible to price stabilisation agreements.That is why I have suggested as a complement to price stabilisation, thatwe should examine schemes to stabilise export earnings. I propose this fora number of reasons. Such schemes are particularly helpful, one might al-most say essential to countries where production is hit by drought or othernatural disasters.Twenty-two Commonwealth countries have had reason to welcome theLome Convention concluded between the European Community and the african, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. These negotiations werenot initiated as a result of the British Governmenfs renegotiations, butthey were powerfully accelerated and intensified by the effect of our re-negotiations. I have made clear to our own Parliament that we intend tobuild on Lome in respect of Asian countries, so powerfully represented atthis Conference Asian countries who have gained a little but have notparticipated in the arrangements for ACP countries.
Under the Lome Convention forty-six countries will begin to benefit from the export stabilisation scheme, STABEX. This is an important step forward, though limited in scope. It may be difficult to extend it in itspresent form, and of course International Monetary Fund (IMF) schemes are also limited in scope. That is why we have to look at other possibilities for wider self-financing schemes.Mr. Chairman, you called on Tuesday for a new approach, for thereversal of generations of world history, in which the principles so manyof us have advocated for greater equality within our countries could become a reality as between countries, a reality which would put an end to thecenturies old exploitation of so many primary producers by so many im-pofting manufacturing countries. That was what you charged us with on tuesday morning.These principles I accept. Indeed I accepted them when, together with others, I founded that movement in Britain, whose work has become known in the Commonwealth and more widely, &quot;War on Want&quot;.In your inaugural speech on Tuesday, and equally in your interview on british television on these matters which so greatly impressed many of myfellow countrymen, it was clear that you were at that time asserting the arrival of a new age in world economic affairs. The producing countries were going to strengthen and exercise their muscle, indeed some were alreadydoing so, and they were going to do that as a counter to the muscle which you and others feel has been exerted against primary producing countries by those who take their products and who in the past have themselvesnot disdained the use of cartels, both in buying and selling. But in thattelevision broadcast you expressed a clear preference that once a balanceof power had been established, then the solution should be sought throughreason and argument and the creation of advantageous agreements cover-ing all aspects of commodity stabilisation.The same thought clearly inspired an important passage of your speech on Tuesday:  &quot;The choices that face us are these: producer associations can eitherbecome the instruments through which producing nations conduct arational dialogue with consumers within the framework of a neweconomic order: or, for want of dialogue, they will become increasinglythe instruments through which the third world take such unilateral action as is demanded by the cause of survival and equity. The choice,therefore, is inevitably between dialogue and confrontation. The chal-lenge to this Conference is to explore the ways by which the scales ofprobability may be tipped in favour of dialogue&quot;.And it was in this context that you used the phrase which moved us all,when you said, &quot;I believe that the Commonwealth may be uniquely blessedfor this effort&quot;.For this Conference represents over a quarter of the membership ofthe United Nations and a quarter of the world&apos;s population: it representsevery continent, every ocean, every significant region of the world. Itshould neither have come here nor should it leave with an inferioritycomplex about its moral power, and its power to give a lead in world affairs.Naturally, we cannot negotiate a general agreement on commodities here
at Kingston. All I am hoping for is a &quot;Second Reading Debate&quot; on theseproposals. If my colleagues saw merit in the general approach, perhapsCommonwealth countries could together carry the Debate forward at the7th Special Session of the UN General Assembly in September next as a contribution to the Debate on world economic development, so that practicalwork could be set in hand when the 4th United Nations Committee on Tradeand Development (UNCTAD) meets in another Commonwealth capital,Nairobi, next May.But in what you have proposed, and in what I have attempted to setout, there is a greater degree of common ground than many would expect,recognising that we speak for countries with a very different economicbackground come here to link hands across the so-called great dividebetween producers and consumers, advanced and developing countries.In a purely domestic speech in Britain last year to our trade union move-ment, dealing with Britain&apos;s internal problems, I said, referring to the forth-coming American Bicentenary celebrations, that what we needed in Britain,as in the world, was not a declaration of independence, but a declarationof interdependence.Your theme, supported by others this week, was that the great battlefor political independence of previously dependent nations has been largelywon and that the struggle now is for economic independence for thosenations and peoples. But what we are both saying is that independence isnot enough, indeed that economic independence can turn out perhaps to beitself no more than a fantasy. What we both are seeking, and I believe this Conference, are seeking, is mutual advantage and mutual concern,based on each seeking our individual strength, with a frame-work of worldinterdependence.
PART TWOWORLD ECONOMIC INTERDEPENDENCE AND TRADEIN COMMODITIESTHE PURPOSE OF THIS memorandum. One of the world&apos;s most pressing and complex problems, which facesall governments, is trade in commodities. The survey of commodity problems in this paper is intended to assist the Conference in their discussion ofthis issue.2. This first section of the survey begins with a review of commodityproblems in the interdependent world of today. This is followed by a brief account of international discussions which have recently been taking place to try to provide a framework within which the problems of commoditytrade can be sensibly tackled. The survey then goes on to describe thehistory and operation of commodity agreements, and to assess the scope for future co-operation in the stabilisation of prices and supplies, includingschemes for the stabilisation of earnings from commodity exports. Someof these issues and several related questions are dealt with in greater detail in the supporting material in Part Three of this White Paper.COMMODITY PROBLEMS IN A WORLD CONTEXT3. The need for co-operation by all members of the international com-munity is clearer now than it has ever been. World-wide inflation, coupled with deepening recession in many major countries, massive imbalances in international payments and rapid movements in exchange rates have com-bined to pose problems for all governments. The interdependence of nationsis such that no government can find solutions to these problems on its own.4. The events of the past few years have highlighted the special difficultiesassociated with internationally traded commodities: food and raw materials.In no field of economic activity is the interdependence of the world com-munity more obvious than in the production, trade and use of commodities.All countries, even those most richly endowed with natural resources, relyto some extent on imports from other countries for an adequate supply ofmany of the commodities they need. All countries, even those with thefewest natural resources, produce some commodities. All countries are con-cerned in commodity trade and many are vitally dependent upon it. It isimpossible to make simple distinctions, such as between poor producers andrich consumers. The problems of commodity trade can only be solved by co-operative international action.5. This overlap between producers and consumers means that all countries are likely to be affected by instability in commodity prices, though indifferent ways and to varying extents. Many countries&apos; balance of payments were disturbed by the recent commodities price boom; the five-fold increase
in the price of oil seriously affected all non-oil producing countries; theeffects of each were accentuated by the combination of the two.6. Many developing countries depend largely on the ratio between their earnings from commodity exports and their expenditure on commodityimports. Those with a strong export balance in commodities are better able to withstand commodity increases, and even the oil surcharge. Butthey may still lose on imports much of what they gain from increasedexport prices. Countries with few or no commodity exports will inevitably be hard hit by increased prices. Some developed countries, including theUnited Kingdom (until North Sea oil is fully on stream), fall into this category. Still harder hit by price increases on their imports of energy andof essential foods and raw materials are the developing countries with no exportable commodities; while those countries which were already facingstarvation from famine or drought or for other reasons have been most seriously affected of all.7. Instability in commodity prices, gluts and shortages, are not in thelong-term interests of developing international trade. They make long-term planning of production difficult if not impossible. Neither producers norconsumers are likely to gain from violent market fluctuations. Producercountries which may seem to benefit for a time from very high pricesoften find that they too are subject to the inflation that is generated. More-over, demand may be reduced and substitution encouraged. Similarly, aserious slump in prices is not in the long-term interest of the consumers.Production is likely to be curtailed and scarcity induced. industrialised countries which import commodities but rely on the export of manu-factures may suffer as much from the impoverishment of their overseascustomers among the primary producers as they benefit from lower import prices. In the long term, both producers and consumers share an interestin orderly trade in an expanding world economy.8. Recent experience has shown how far we are away from orderly and stable trade in commodities. Even if we leave aside the special case of oil, the simultaneous upsurge in demand in 1972/73 in most industrialised countries was followed by massive increases in the price of food and rawmaterials which gave renewed impetus to world inflation and dislocatedbalances of payments with effects that are still only too evident. For some commodities the subsequent price fall has been such that the expansion ofsupplies to meet future world demands is jeopardised. If we neglect the lessons of the past, we may face higher peaks and deeper troughs in thefuture.9. In part, the lessons have not been learned because the problems are so complex. Each commodity is a special case, with special features affectingits production and use. Some have a long production cycle, some areperishable, some are bulky, some are in competition with synthetics, andso on. Indeed, although we can detect general commodity cycles in the statistics, there are major variations in the experience of individual com-modities. Even now, the adjustments to the boom are still working their way through. It is important to recognise this diversity, so that we are notmisled into thinking that there is any easy solution of general applicability.
But that diversity is also a challenge to our ingenuity and our will to co-operate in working towards solutions.THE SCOPE OF INTERNATIONAL DISCUSSIONS10. There is no straightforward equation between producers and develop-ing countries on the one hand and consumers and developed countries onthe other. Nevertheless, it is true that trade in primary products is of greaterrelative importance to developing countries and it is therefore understand-able that over the years, and particularly in the last few years, the develop-ing countries should have devoted special attention to the problems of tradein commodities. In a series of international meetings and at meetings oftheir own, developing countries have set out in some detail their views and proposals in this field as in others. Their proposals covered a wide range including commodity agreements; buffer stocks; equitable prices for exports and safeguards for export earnings; indexation of commodity prices;improved access and conditions for developing country products in the markets of developed countries; commodity producer associations; and help for expanding the capacity of developing countries for processing com-modities for export.11. Some of these proposals have not been acceptable to developed countries and inevitably there have been disagreements which have pre-vented progress towards the practical application of new arrangements forcommodities. A central point of difference hitherto has been that in generalthe developed countries have considered that work should proceed on a commodity by commodity basis while the developing countries have usuallyformulated requests for wide-ranging arrangements covering all or manycommodities.12. These differences of approach should not, however, be allowed toobscure the fact that there is a great deal of common ground and common interest. The events of the last two or three years have led to new thinkingand a readiness to re-examine long-standing problems with fresh minds.The recent meeting of the UNCTAD Committee on Commodities givesencouraging evidence of how common ground can be built upon. Thechief interest was in the UNCTAD Secretary General&apos;s proposals for a programme of work on the &quot;integrated approach&quot; for commodity prob-lems. The resolution adopted by consensus calls for further studies of this.The &quot;integrated approach&quot; is based essentially on the idea of setting up aninternationally-financed stockpile for 18 diverse commodities*, linked toa system of multilateral commitments for sales and purchases together withcompensatory financing and an increase in local processing. A great dealof work has been done both by individual countries and in international bodies to study all these problems in depth. The study by the Common-wealth Secretariat on Terms of Trade Policy for Primary Commodities is amost useful contribution. Both the new climate of thought and the detailed work which has already been done provide a new and encouraging basis on which to build. We must still bear in mind that each commodity has*Wheat, Maize, Rice, Sugar, Coffee, Cocoa, Tea, Cotton, Jute, Wool, Hard fibres,Rubber, Copper, Lead, Zinc, Tin, Bauxite/Alumina, Iron-ore.
its own special characteristics and that any multi-commodity arrangement would be difficult to devise. However, it may well be sensible to search out and identify a number of common features which apply to most com-modities and to see whether these can be brought together to provide a new and more comprehensive approach to the whole problem of commoditytrade.COMMODITY AGREEMENTS13. Since well before the Second World War attempts have been madeto regulate trade in commodities by means of mechanisms aimed at stabilis-ing supplies and prices. So far consumers and producers have succeeded in reaching agreements with economic provisions to cover only a handful of commodities. The evidence suggests that these agreements have been more successful in protecting floor prices than ceiling prices. Moreover, they have proved incapable of dealing with the kinds of fluctuations in price and supply that have occured over the past few years.14. Despite this, we should be prepared in suitable cases to seek tonegotiate new agreements, and to try in these to avoid the shortcomingsexperienced in the past. The first step should be to identify which com-modities represent the most likely candidates for new or renewed arrange-ments. Here the work of the FAO the GATT and UNCTAD is of con-siderable value. Our initial assessment of those commodities for whichnew or renewed arrangements would be most likely to help in assuringadequate supplies at reasonable prices and in improving the conditions ofthe poorest countries, suggests the following possibilities: cereals, cocoa,coffee, copper, dairy products, jute, rubber, sisal, sugar, tea and tin. Ofthese tea, jute and sisal are of particular interest to the poorest Common-wealth producers.15. In negotiating each commodity agreement it will be necessary tore-examine the whole spectrum of mechanisms for stabilising price and supply. This is well-trodden ground and no radically new strategy on priceadjustment mechanisms is likely to emerge; terms have to be negotiatedfor each commodity and the constraints are well known to consumers andproducers alike. The issues are considered in more detail in Part Three.The stabilisation of prices and supplies has traditionally been attempted bymeans of export/import quotas and buffer stocks. Major problems here arethe high initial cost of establishing even a modest level of stockpiling andthe effect of high interest rates on the cost of maintaining stocks. the developing countries have already put emphasis on the need for financial help to establish stockpiles; and in this area there could be mutually bene-ficial arrangements between producers and consumers. The difficulties in-volved tend to be specific to individual commodities and these are outlined in the appropriate annexes, but there are also general problems such as theexercise of control over the management of the stocks.16. While recognising the need to try to maintain and where possibleto increase the real income of developing countries from their primaryexports, there are very great problems involved in attempting to establishany automatic link between the price of particular commodities and the
price of manufactured goods. Such a system would be inflexible and couldnot be guaranteed to produce increased earnings for the producers withoutthe most elaborate arrangements between the governments of all the mainproducers and consumers. There are the obvious risks of substitution ifprices are raised above the levels which the market will bear, as well asthose of reduced consumption. If such a system were to be fully effectiveit could reinforce inflationary pressures in times of high demand and add to the difficulties of developing countries through the effect on their ownimport bills.EXPORT EARNINGS STABILISATION17. Commodity agreements offer the possibility of bringing about greaterstability in commodity prices. The experience of agreements in the pastsuggests that over a period they will tend to maintain prices at somewhat higher levels than would otherwise obtain and to that extent to bringabout some degree of transfer of resources from consumers to producers.But not all the producers would be developing countries and some of the commodities produced by the developing countries may be particularly difficult candidates for effective commodity agreements. A complementaryapproach would be to extend the scope of schemes for stabilising the export earnings of developing country producers. Among the advantages of earningsstabilisation schemes are:(a) as they do not attempt to operate directly on price levels, theyare less affected by fluctuations of supply and demand than areprices stablisation agreements;(b) they can be specifically related to the problems of individual countries;(c) they can benefit individual producers suffering from temporarydisruptions in supplies.18. Several schemes for increasing the stability of export earnings amongstproducer countries have been put forward in the past. At the present time there is one in operation under the aegis of the IMF and another, resultingfrom the negotiations between the European Economic Community (e.c.)and ACP countries in the Lome Convention, will take effect from the entry into force of that Convention. Although there is clearly no funda-mental difficulty in devising broader schemes, there are limitations on theireffectiveness.19. In looking at this complex of issues we must continually have inmind the special problems of the poorest developing countries which havebeen hard-hit by the impact of the oil crisis, which have themselves suffered from the increases in the price of fertilisers and of food and other rawmaterials, which have not necessarily shared in the boom in raw material prices, and which now face the threat of reduced demand for their products in a world recession. They need adequate, reasonably-priced and increasingsupplies of feeding stuffs and of fertilisers to produce more food, to enablethem to raise themselves above subsistence level and to develop exportableproducts. Many of their problems must be tackled through conventional
aid. But it may also be necessary to devise favourable terms for them inany scheme of export earnings stabilisation or in relation to the financing ofbuffer stocks of commodities of particular interest to them.CONCLUSION20. There is no neat and tidy solution to the commodities problem whichwill satisfy all the aspirations of developing countries on the one hand andbe wholly acceptable to the developed countries on the other. international discussion over a period of many years has given rise to a bewilderingvariety of proposals. We must create an atmosphere of greater confidence,in which we can all look forward to a more assured future. A first taskmight therefore be to draw up an agreed statement of the common groundbetween consumers and producers, whether developed or developing, whetherrich or poor.21. Such a statement might take the form of a general agreement oncommodities, containing general commitments and specific proposals for action, as set out below GENERAL COMMITMENTS1. To recognise the interdependence of producers and consumers and thedesirability of conducting trade in commodities in accordance withequitable arrangements worked out in agreement between producers and consumers.2. On the part of producer countries, to maintain adequate and securesupplies to consumer countries.3. On the part of consumer countries, to improve access to markets for those items of primary production of interest to developing producers.4. To establish the principle that commodity prices should be equitableto consumers and remunerative to efficient producers and at a level which will encourage longer-term equilibrium between production and consumption.5. To recognise in particular the need to expand the total production of essential foodstuffs.6. To encourage the efficient development, production and marketing of commodities (mineral or agricultural, with emphasis on forest products)and diversification and the efficient processing of commodities in de-veloping countries.In any general agreement, or other means to advance, heavy emphasismust be laid on the special needs of the poorest countries.PROPOSALS FOR ACTION1. To establish better exchanges of information on forward supply and demand.
2. To elaborate more specific rules to define the circumstances in whichimport and export restrictions may be applied to commodities.3. To encourage the development of producer/consumer associations for individual commodities.4. To give fresh impetus to the joint efforts of producers and consumersto conclude commodity agreements designed to facilitate the orderlyconduct and development of trade. This could be done, first by identify-ing commodities appropriate to the conclusion of such agreements;second by analysing commodity by commodity the appropriate mechan-isms for the regulation of trade within the framework of such agree-ments (including international buffer stocks, co-ordination of nationallyheld stocks, production controls and export quotas); third by examiningways in which any financial burden arising from these mechanisms maybe appropriately financed.5. To agree that the regulatory mechanisms incorporated in any inter-national commodity agreement would be directed towards the mainten-ance of market prices within a range negotiated in accordance withthe principles enshrined in the fourth general commitment.6. To establish the framework of a scheme for the stabilisation of export earnings from commodities.
PART THREEA.  A NOTE ON COMMODITY arrangements and AGREEMENTSHISTORY1. The earliest schemes designed to regulate trade in commodities bystabilising prices and supplies were usually producer cartels. They soughtwith varying degrees of success to limit supplies coming on to the market.The pre-Second World War coffee, sugar and tea cartels were examples.However, the 1933 Wheat Agreement, though very short-lived, was impor-tant because it was one of the first to encompass both exporting andimporting interests; in a certain sense it anticipated some of the objectives in Chapter VI of the Havana Charter which furnished for the post-war world a code of guiding principles underlying international commoditynegotiations. The principle in the Havana Charter that producers and consumers should have equal weight in shaping the provisions of an agree-ment implies the need for a balance of interest between the participants.But this requirement has made it more difficult to complete formal com-commodity agreements with economic provisions. In fact, producers and con-sumers have only succeeded in reaching agreements with economic provisions to cover coffee, cocoa, sugar, wheat and tin. These agreements aimed at a balance between supply and demand, so as to hold prices within an inter-nationally agreed range.Informal Arrangements2. For some commodities there have been arrangements short of com-commodity agreements, providing for information sharing and discussion withthe aim of stabilising prices: producers and consumers meet periodicallyto exchange views on market trends supply, demand and investmentprospects. Such arrangements are well suited to commodities with longgestation periods for new capacity, such as many minerals and tree crops,where forward planning is desirable to avoid or mitigate successive medium term cycles of over- and under-investment. Thus agricultural and foodcommodities are regularly discussed in the Food and Agriculture Organisa-tion (FAO) Committee on Commodity Problems. There is an InternationalStudy Group for rubber, and the United Nations Committee on Tradeand Development (UNCTAD) Committees for tungsten and manganese;producers and consumers of lead and zinc operate an annual discussiongroup. The practice could usefully be extended. Similar discussions ofcourse take place for those commodities which are subject to more formalarrangements.3. There can also be informal price arrangements such as those for sisaland jute (see Annexes IX and VII). This type of scheme may be appropriate for low-value materials for which the cost of administering an agreement would be relatively large; but they tend to break down easily, as happened in 1973.
4. International commodity agreements require formal signature bymember governments and a full-time secretariat. The agreements have inthe past incorporated a range of mechanisms, the chief effect of whichhas been to protect a minimum price for the producers. The most commonof these mechanisms are described below. (But none of them except theInternational Tin Agreement is operating effectively at the present time.)i. Export QuotasThe export quota, by means of which supplies are controlled by export-ing countries, has the object of securing a guaranteed price for theexporter and some security of supply for the consumer. This was a feature of the International Sugar Agreement (ISA) as well as theCommonwealth Sugar Agreement (CSA); the Coffee and Cocoa Agree-ments also have provisions for export quotas. In the case of the agri-cultural commodities such as cocoa, an agreement would provide foran adjustable system of export quotas allocated to the individual pro-producer countries. These quotas are often operated in conjunction witha buffer stock; and have the objective of stabilising prices within a given range. Generally speaking, as the world price of the commodityrises the export quotas are progressively increased and finally suspended.On the other hand, when the world price falls below a fixed point the quotas are re-introduced, and can be progressively reduced. Where thereare no buffer stocks the quotas can be maintained either by short-termstorage or in the last resort by destruction of the surplus in the caseof agricultural products, and by reducing output in the case of minerals.In an extreme situation, it is possible for the system of export quotasto be replaced by formal export restrictions imposed by agreementbetween the producing countries. But these tend to have a disruptiveinfluence on production and investment programmes.ii. Agreed Minimum PricesAnother method, which can only be used when export is in the handsof governments or other monopolistic exporters, is for an agreement to be made to respect an agreed minimum price in all transactions.This can be accompanied by an undertaking by individual consumingcountries to buy and individual producing countries to sell a designated-nated quantity.iii. Buffer stocks for those products that can be stored for a period the fluctuationsof supply and demand can be countered by buffer stocks. These protect the producer by buying supplies when the price reaches the lower endof a range and assist consumers by releasing stocks when prices have risen to the upper end, eg at times of short-falls caused by cropfailures or other disasters. The stocks can be held nationally or inter-nationally and may be financed by contributions from producers orconsumers. Depending on their size and the efficiency of their manage-ment, they are capable of contributing to a limited extent to market -stabilisation. The International Tin Agreement and the Cocoa Agree-ment both have provisions for internationally held buffer stocks. The
International Sugar Agreement had provisions for nationally heldstocks.iv. Periodic Price ReviewsAll these arrangements must necessarily use a target price or pricerange as their triggering mechanism, and these can be made subjectto periodical reviews or consultations between producers and consumers.For instance the Cocoa and Tin Agreements provide for periodic pricereviews as did the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement. Other more limited arrangements such as the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT) Agreement on skimmed milk powder and butter oilshave provisions for minimum export prices (these are currently wellbelow present world prices).v. InformationAll of these agreements by their nature tend to afford clearing houses for exchanges of information between producers and consumers, asdoes the Olive Oil Agreement, which has no economic provisions: tosome extent these exchanges contribute towards market stability.5. The United Kingdom has supported commodity agreements as a meansof meeting the problem of instability of supply and price of raw materials,though we have recognised that these are not necessarily the best or onlymechanisms and that more informal arrangements are sometimes more appropriate and we participate in a number of these. We are, or have been,a member of all the major agreements and are participating, or intend toparticipate, in the negotiations for the new agreements planned for cocoa,tin and coffee.6. None of the agreements was ever wholly successful in ensuring stability of prices and supplies: their economic provisions have not generally beenable to withstand the pressures generated by shortages and high price.Chart A in Annex I shows that fluctuations in price have continued overa long period. Such palliative measures as sales from buffer stocks have proved inadequate to bring prices down to reasonable levels. Chart B showsthat the few commodity agreements functioning 2i years ago had littlerestraining impact on a worldwide increase in commodity prices unprecedent-dented since the time of the Korean war. Chart C in Annex I shows howprices, as measured by The Economists Sterling Indicator, have risen froma low point of 84 in November 1971 to 265 at the end of February 1974,since when there has been a significant reduction, especially in metals. *The price rises can be accounted for in terms of increases in demand, ofinterruptions in supply that have been compounded by the effects of theMiddle East war and the oil crisis, and by droughts and other natural causes.Economic Effects of Price Stabilisation Schemes in the Past7. Various attempts have been made to analyse the effectiveness of pastcommodity agreements in stabilising prices but statistical difficulties tendindividual commodity prices from 1972/75 are given in Chart D in Annex I;and quarterly averages from 1970/75 are given in Chart E.
to preclude hard and fast judgments. Work done for the 3rd UNCTAD(1972) analysed price fluctuations in pre- and post-agreement periods forseveral commodities, using the average deviation of actual prices from alinear trend constructed for each period. For wheat, sugar (the ISA), oliveoil (except the first agreement) and tin this analysis shows lower averagedeviations from trend in the periods when the agreements were in force.For coffee the picture is the reverse. However, with the probable exceptionof sugar, the increase in stability may not really be attributable to theagreements. The pre-agreement period used for wheat was the immediate post-war years; after that over-supply was the norm. The pre-agreementperiod for tin included the Korean War. For coffee, conversely, the secondagreement period covers years of exceptionally unfavourable physical con-ditions in the main producing country.8. The authors of the above study conclude that even before the price increases of 1973, past agreements did not cope as well as they might in circumstances of shortage. However, they probably contributed marginallyto stability of supply and prices.POSSIBILITIES FOR FUTURE PRICE STABILISATION SCHEMES9. Any future scheme must consist of some combination of the basicingredients set out in paragraph 4 above.10. Unlike the existing agreements, most of which were conceived inan atmosphere of glut (an anticipated glut in the case of wheat in 1949),future agreements will be conceived in the aftermath of the unprecedentedshortages of 1973/74 as well as in the more familiar context of falling com-commodity prices as world economic activity declines. It seems likely therefore that there will be considerable interest in inserting into any new agree-ments provision for larger buffer stocks, definite global commitments tosupply to consumer members and perhaps a sliding scale of additional commitments to supply in times of shortage at progressively higher prices in relation to the target range of prices (for instance by diverting supplies from consuming countries that were not signatories to the agreement).11. However, the establishment and enlargement of buffer stocks is subject to at least four practical difficulties i. First there are the problems of controlling and managing bufferstocks. Some of these are technical difficulties. For instance it is far more difficult to manage a stock of a heterogeneous product such astea than of, for instance, a metal; and some products such as coffeehave proved more difficult than was expected to store in large quantities.In addition there are the inevitable problems of setting up and runningan international organisation representing diverse interests.ii. Secondly there is the difficulty of judging the requisite scale ofthe stocks. This involves taking a view of the degree of insurance thatthe members desire, and assessing the likely scale of world trade inthe commodity and the size and frequency of fluctuations in supply
and demand. These assessments may be difficult at a time when nobodycan be certain whether the recent trend towards greater instability willcontinue.iii. Thirdly there is the problem of finding the money. It has been calculated that for copper alone the value at present prices of a bufferstock representing 10 per cent of a year&apos;s output a proportion whichhas proved inadequate for tin could be  500 million. The financial problem would have to be tackled separately for each commodity. Butif the policy worked well, the commodity would be sold when world prices had increased, so funds to build up buffer stocks could beregarded as finance for investment rather than for consumption.iv. Finally, there is a problem of timing, since the stocks cannotbe built up except when a surplus is available.Nevertheless, in spite of the difficulties, there should be scope in manycommodities for mutually beneficial co-operation between producing andconsuming countries in buffer stock management. Indeed in many waysthe provision of buffer stocks might be seen as one of the keys to smoothingthe harmful fluctuations of supply, demand and price that the world hasbeen experiencing.Commodities Suitable for Agreements12. We have described the trade in a number of commodities in AnnexesII to XVI. Some promising candidates for commodity agreements wouldseem to be i. Cereals. (Annex II) In their approach to the GATT multilateral trade negotiations the e.c. is likely to propose new commodity agree-ments for cereals including provisions for stockpiles and a price rangewithin which transactions would take place. The International wheat council has set up a preparatory group to examine the elements ofa new wheat agreement.ii. Cocoa. (Annex III) There is an International Cocoa Agreement,but its economic provisions have not come into effect. Negotiationsfor a new agreement are due this year.iii. Coffee. (Annex IV) The current International Coffee Agreementbroke down in 1971. Negotiation of a new agreement is now in progress.iv. Copper. (Annex V) Producer and consumer countries are anxious about the uncertainties arising from fluctuations in the price and aboutthe prospects for investment if prices continue at the present low level.v. Dairy products. (Annex VI) The e.c., in the context of the GATTmultilateral trade negotiations, is likely to propose a full commodityagreement. It would provide for the setting of both maximum and minimum prices for each product. There would be no buffer stock.vi. Rubber. (Annex VIII)  A meeting of the International Rubber
Study Group will take place in October 1975, and international arrange-ments in connection with the trading of natural rubber will be discussed.vn.  Sisal j ^nnexes jx anti yil)vm. Jute )Informal arrangements already exist and on the whole work quite well;but there is probably scope for improvement.ix. Sugar. (Annex X) The most recent international sugar agreementwith full economic provisions was that of 1968-73. The present ISAis purely administrative but committed in principle to the negotiation of an economic agreement in due course.x. Tea. (Annex XI) A new International Tea Agreement has beenin discussion in FAO for some years. A working party of exportershas been set up to study the question.xi. Tin. (Annex XII) The United Kingdom is a member of theFourth International Tin Agreement which expires in June 1976.Negotiations for the Fifth Agreement are due to begin in May thisyear and the United Kingdom will be participating. Discussion will include the possibility of a larger buffer stock and of contributions toits financing from consumers.13. The remaining commodities would appear to be unpromising forone reason or another. Bauxite, alumina and aluminium (Annex XIII) areproduced and processed by six companies that operate worldwide. Iron ore(Annex XIV) is produced in too many countries and the major producersare not developing countries. Lead and zinc (Annex XV) are covered by a study group which works well. Tungsten (Annex XVI) is also covered by a useful discussion group. A list of other products unlikely to be suitable forcommodity agreements is given in Annex XVII.Economic Effects of Future Price Stabilisation Schemes14. Looking ahead over the next few years the best that can be done isto make an impressionistic guess as to the effect of widespread commodity agreements compared to expected commodity price behaviour. Much would depend on the basic price or range of prices chosen as the targets in thenew agreements.15. New agreements could be expected to have some mutually beneficialstabilising effect. But this happy outcome depends crucially not only on a successful and speedy conclusion of new commodity agreements but also on the speed and scale of the next upturn in world economic activity. If,as many analyses suggest, 1977 and 1978 see a simultaneous growth of output in all industrialised countries on a scale comparable to that of1972/73, the new agreements could well come under considerable pressure.Smoother world economic cycles are a prerequisite for more effectivecommodity arrangements, and measures directly aimed at avoiding world-wide &quot;overheating&quot; will therefore be required.
Effects on Different Groups ;,16. Consuming countries. It follows from the above that, put simply,the greater the likelihood of severe fluctuations in commodity prices thegreater the desirability of price stabilisation schemes but also the smallertheir chances of success in avoiding the peaks in commodity prices. Giventhis limitation, the benefits to consuming countries of such success as maybe had under stabilisation schemes will be in the form of avoiding expensive(technically, economically and politically) adjustments to changes in avail-ability and prices of commodities. The total benefits for each consumercountry would depend on the relative importance in total imports of particu-lar commodities covered by agreements, the scope for and cost of stabilisation-tion, the importance of the commodities in their end-uses and the availability of substitutes. To the extent that price stabilisation schemes also stabilise theexport earnings of producers, then there would be benefit to consumercountries similar to those under export earnings stabilisation schemes,discussed in Note B.17. Producing countries. On the basis of a downward movement of world food prices the terms of trade of food producers in the next 2 years would be likely to be more favourable under price stabilisation agreementswhile those of raw material producers would be better initially and worselater. Annex XVIII lists the main exporters of various primary products.Rich producers would be the chief beneficiaries of price stabilisation agree-ments, the main effect of which would be to build up stocks, therebyholding up prices in the next few years, against the eventuality of futuresupply shortfalls. Very few of the poorest countries appear in the list atall. Jute, sisal and tea are the only commodities of which the main producersare among the poorest countries. However, a number of middle incomeless developed countries appear on the lists. Some of these countries have suffered, and would suffer again, from export earnings instability due to price fluctuations and would welcome new or improved price stabilisationagreements. To the extent that the demand for their exports is relativelyunresponsive to price increases they would achieve a certain improvementin their export earnings as well as greater stability of earnings under such agreements.Indexation18. It has on occasion been suggested that commodity prices should be linked to manufactured goods prices; thus commodity prices would be stabilised in relative terms but not in absolute terms. In practice indexationof this type would not be a simple matter. First, from time to time, the relationship of commodity prices to manufactured goods needs to change;otherwise there will be persistent periods of over- or under-supply whichcould harm both producers and consumers. Producers would only gain fromindexation over the long term if over-supply did not arise, which is unlikely,or if it were countered by export quotas or measures to support consumption by the importing countries. Second, there are practical problems in organising trade on an indexed footing, arising particularly from the factthat most commodity trading is not conducted on a government to govern-ment basis.
B.  A NOTE ON EXPORT EARNINGS STABILISATION SCHEMES1. The developing countries are interested in &quot;measures designed toincrease and stabilise primary commodity export earnings ... at equitableand remunerative prices and to maintain a mutually acceptable relationship between the prices of manufactured goods and those of primary products&quot;(general principle of the UNCTAD first session quoted by the Group of 77 intheir resolution to the UNCTAD Committee on Commodities, 18 February1975). Export earnings stabilisation schemes are designed to maintain theimport capacity of individual developing countries but without directlyaffecting the prices of goods. Two schemes of this kind are already inexistence: the IMF facility and the Lome Convention commodity scheme(STABEX).IMF Facility2. Under existing arrangements the Fund may provide assistance, inaddition to ordinary drawing rights, for compensatory financing of exportfluctuations and for buffer stock financing.3. In order to qualify for a drawing under the compensatory financingfacility a member country must demonstrate that it is encountering balanceof payments difficulties produced by export shortfalls of a short-term naturelargely attributable to circumstances beyond its control and must undertaketo co-operate with the Fund in finding a solution to the difficulties. Thefacility is geared to primary producers and is particularly aimed at countries whose exports depend upon a single raw material; general balance ofpayments difficulties arising from short-falls in the exports of a wide range of commodities are usually financed by ordinary credit tranche drawings.The short-fall is determined by comparing actual exports in the short-fallyear with estimates of the medium term trend (5 year moving average);there is provision for an allowance of up to 10 per cent for projectedexport growth over the next 2 years.4. Finance is limited to 25 per cent of a member&apos;s quota in any one year(except in the case of natural disasters) and a total limit of 50 per cent ofquota. Drawings under the facility carry an interest rate of 4 per cent perannum rising to 6 per cent after 5 years and members are expected torepurchase drawings within 3-5 years. Access does not require a priordrawing on the &quot;gold tranche&quot;. Members also have the right, with the Fund&apos;s agreement, to reclassify part or all of a credit tranche drawing as a com-pensatory finance drawing within 6 months.5. The buffer stock financing facility was established to assist members to meet the cost of participating in commodity agreements which includedan international buffer stock. When applying for Fund assistance the member has to demonstrate that the obligation to contribute to an approvedbuffer stock would create difficulties for its balance of payments. The &quot;goldtranche&quot; must be drawn before a drawing can be made under this facility.
Otherwise the conditions are the same as for compensatory finance drawings.The limit on total drawings under both facilities together is set at 75 percent of the quota.6. Little use is currently being made of the buffer stock financing facility.Only one drawing of 5.2 million special drawing rights (SDR) is outstanding.On the other hand 18 countries have outstanding drawings under thecompensatory financing scheme totalling SDR 524.6 million. In january the IMF Interim Committee, following a proposal from the IndonesianMinister of Finance, asked the Executive Board *to consider possible improvements in both facilities.The Lome Convention Commodity Scheme7. The STABEX scheme approved at the Lome Convention differs fromthe IMF Compensatory Finance Facility in that instead of covering the totalof exports to all destinations it is limited to certain products and, for mostof the benefitting countries, related only to their exports to the e.c.. Onthe other hand the scheme is more concessionary in that in most casesthe benefits, though limited in quantity, do not have to be repaid. The aim off the scheme is to offer some compensation to exporters when, throughno fault of their own, their earnings from exporting certain products to the eec fall below the levels they have become used to.8. Beneficiary countries. All the 46 ACP countries that have signed theConvention of Lome are in principle eligible to draw on the scheme.Whether they do so, and the amount of their drawing, depends on whetherthey export any of the products in question in the minimum quantities, andon whether export earnings from the product(s) in a particular year fallcompared to recent trends. Thus the fund is not pre-allocated by countryand it is difficult to predict how the aid will flow.9. Size of fund. The Convention allocates a maximum of 375 millionunits of account (mua) to the STABEX fund in 5 annual instalments overthe life of the Convention. Most of the money is expected to be disbursedby the end of the period.10. Eligible products. The fund is open to countries exporting one ormore of the following products: ground nuts and their products; cocoaproducts; coffee products; cotton products; coconut products; palm oil;nuts and kernels, oil and cake thereof; hides, skins and leather; woodproducts (except plywood); bananas; tea; sisal; iron ore.11. Mechanism. To become eligible, exporting countries have to showthat the product in question accounts for at least a pertain proportion oftheir total exports to all destinations. This &quot;threshold of dependence&quot; is fixed at 7.5 per cent for all countries other than sisal exporters (5 per cent)and the &quot;least favoured&quot;, landlocked, and island countries (2.5 per cent).** These are as follows:The Bahamas, Barbados, Botswana, Burundi, Central African Republic, Chad,Dahomey, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Fiji, the Gambia, Grenada, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Jamaica, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius. Niger,Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago,Uganda, Upper Volta, Western Samoa and Zambia.
12. Exporters are entitled to draw on the fund whenever the f.o.b. valueof their exports to the e.c. of an eligible product (see paragraph 10)falls sufficiently in relation to past trends. The trend is defined as average earnings from the export of the product to the e.c. market in the fouryears prior to the year in question (the &quot;reference level&quot; of earnings). Smallfluctuations are ignored, but the basis of a claim exists whenever exportsfall by 7.5 per cent or more against the reference level (2.5 per cent ormore in the case of the &quot;least favoured&quot;, landlocked and island countries).This is the &quot;trigger threshold&quot;.13. The resulting shortfall creates a &quot;basis for transfer&quot;. There is no guarantee that the whole of this amount will be covered by compensation from STABEX since the fund is not open-ended. If total claims in any oneyear (allowing for carry-over of unused funds from the previous year andif necessary the calling forward of funds from the next year to meet very heavy claims) exceed the funds available for that year (one-fifth of 375 mua,or 75 mua plus any repayments) all claims would have to be scaled down.14. Administration. Whenever an ACP member puts in a claim this willbe processed by the Commission and a report sent to the STABEX manage-ment committee. This committee, containing representatives from the e.c. and ACP, will meet at least once annually and will have to balance totalclaims on the scheme with the funds available. The scheme does not rule out interim payments being made in advance of a definitive settlement, butthe details of this, and numerous other parts of the scheme, have yet to be worked out at the official level.15. Conditions of finance. The transfers are interest free. There is some,limited, provision for repayment into the fund by countries whose exportsrise in relation to the reference level. However, this only counts when therise is due to a price increase over that in the reference period (and doesnot apply unless the quantity exported is at least as great as that in the reference period). Nor would any repayment ever exceed the amount of transfers already received. Finally, more than half the beneficiary countries those who are &quot;least favoured&quot; in the list above are exempted from the repayment obligation. The use of the transfers is left entirely to the discretion of the recipient country there is no obligation to compensate the producers,for example.Other schemes for stabilising earnings16. There is a wide range of possibilities for further schemes for the stabilisation of earnings. One fundamental question is whether to base them on earnings from certain commodities only, as in STABEX, or on the total exports of the developing countries, as under the IMF scheme. Questionsalso arise on the reference levels of earnings from which short-falls wouldbe measured, on the terms of the finance, on the repayability of benefits,on financial limits and on whether payments should be automatic ordiscretionary. These questions are discussed in Annex XIX.
Economic Effects of Earnings Stabilisation Schemes17. The remaining paragraphs in this note analyse the effects of earnings stabilisation schemes that are not based on concessional finance.The use of such schemes for transferring resources to the poorer countriesraises separate issues.18. Producing countries. In the absence of price or earnings stabilisationschemes primary product exporters are vulnerable to sudden ups and downsin their export earnings as prices rise and fall. Upswings are obviouslybetter than downswings but can result in increases in money supply and imports which are difficult to reverse in subsequent years. Downswings, ifnot cushioned by foreign exchange reserves, require dislocating cuts in imports usually of investment goods because of the political difficulty of cutting consumer imports, particularly of food and/or emergencyborrowing short term and at high interest rates. Primary product exports are also usually a major source of tax revenue and a drop in prices cutsgovernment revenues directly as well as indirectly if imports and thereforeimport duty revenue decline. Not all primary product exporters suffer tothe same degree; some have a more diversified range of exports than othersand some products&apos; prices fluctuate more than others. The worst affectedare commodity producing countries such as Ghana, Chile and Zambiawhich are (or have been) heavily dependent on one commodity (cocoaor copper) whose price fluctuates widely. Annex XVIII on the maincommodity exporters shows what proportion of their total exports is formed by the given commodities and gives an indication of the degree to whichprice fluctuations affect their economies.19. Effective price or earnings stabilisation schemes would reduce these problems but earnings stabilisation schemes have two additional advantages.First, they come into force if a country&apos;s problem is due not only tofalling prices but also to crop failure or mining disaster, for example. Inthis respect earnings schemes are definitely superior to price schemes which,by keeping prices lower in times of scarcity, exacerbate the fall in export earnings due to loss of output. Second, if a country is heavily dependenton more than one export commodity, some of which are not suitable forcommodity agreements, earnings stabilisation linked to total exports willprovide more comprehensive assistance. The major disadvantage of earningsschemes for exporters is that, in most cases, the funds will have to be repaid whereas with price stabilisation schemes, if the target prices are well-judged, the exporters&apos; contribution will be limited to rare downward adjust-ments in prices and initial contributions to stockpiling facilities. questions would no doubt arise as to the criteria for eligibility under any scheme.20. Export earnings stabilisation schemes based on individual com-modities will benefit chiefly those countries for which the particularcommodity forms a large share of total exports (see Annex XVIII). the spread of benefits will be similar to that achieved by commodity price stabilisation schemes except that producers of commodities for which forsome reason price stabilisation is impracticable could be included, and thatdeveloped country exporters could be excluded. Schemes based on total
export earnings could benefit a wider range of countries, depending on what criteria for eligibility were agreed.21. Consuming countries. The cost to importers would be the financial contribution they had to make to the operation of a scheme. The existingIMF scheme contains an element of concessionality deriving mainly fromits favourable position in the world&apos;s financial structure rather than fromsubsidisation. Any new scheme would have to be able to operate at least as advantageously as this.22. To the extent that any scheme succeeds in stabilising earnings,consumer countries can expect to benefit from a higher level of exports toproducer countries than would otherwise be possible. Stability of earningsshould also help to maintain investment in producer countries, therebyreducing the risk of future capacity shortages.

ANNEX IICEREALSBasic Statistics1. Statistics of production, consumption and prices for wheat, the majorcereal discussed in this study, are given below.History of Agreements2. Wheat is the only grain to have been subject to international commodity agreements. There has been a continuous series of 3-year agreements since 1949,all of which, with the exception of the current Wheat Trade Convention 1971,have had economic provisions in the form of a balance of obligations betweenexporters and importers. Typical provisions of agreements in the 1960s included the setting of a price range within which trade took place; at prices within thisband importing countries agreed to import a minimum share of their totalpurchases from exporting members, who in turn undertook to satisfy thecommercial requirements of importing members. There were no stockholdingprovisions. Earlier agreements were similar in principle, though with lessflexible provisions.3. The 1950s were a period of stability for the wheat trade, despite post-warshortages early in the decade and a growing abundance of supplies thereafter,and some credit for this may belong to successive agreements whose existenceprovided an environment within which stabilisation policies could be pursued.However in general, stability was due less to the agreements than to the policies of the major exporters, Canada and the US, which controlled supplies on to theworld market by means of production quotas and pricing policy. Similarly in1963/64 and 1965/66 it was the large North American stockpiles which hadaccrued as a result of this policy which enabled exceptional demand from theUSSR and India to be met without the world price exceeding the top of thenegotiated price range of the 1962 Agreement, rather than the efficacy of theprovisions of the Agreement themselves. Finally in 1969/71 the existence of growing stocks of grain overhanging the market pushed prices below the bottom of the price range, and since the 1967 Agreement lacked powers to deal with this situation it was the action of exporters in cutting production which eventuallystabilised prices.4. In the wake of this admitted failure of the 1967 Agreement, member countries found it difficult to agree on economic provisions which might provemore effective for its successor; there were also technical problems over theprice setting arrangements which worried the exporters. Agreement on new provisions was impossible in the time available and the 1971 Wheat TradeConvention came into effect mainly as a mechanism to keep the consultativerole of the International Wheat Council in being. Agreement since that date onstabilisation mechanisms proved impossible in the light of the instability of themarket since 1971, which has seen price movements ten times greater than thewidth of the price range normally seen in earlier agreements.
5. It is clear from the history of successive Conventions that their economicprovisions have in general been inadequate to control the formidable problems which large fluctuations in demand and supply can set. The unpredictability ofthese fluctuations is a contributory factor   it has proved impossible to predictmarket developments over the medium or even short term. The negotiators of the1967 Agreement were expecting prices to rise rather than to fall, and the pricerange which they set came under sustained pressure as an excess of supplies ofwheat built up. There was of course no indication in 1971 of the harvest shortageswhich led to the rising prices of 1972/73.New Agreement6. Negotiations concerning a new international wheat agreement are underconsideration in the GATT multilateral trade negotiations and in the Inter-national Wheat Council. In their approach to the GATT negotiations, the EECis likely to propose agreements for cereals to establish national stockpiles withrules laying down the minimum and maximum stocks required and with a pricerange within which transactions would take place. The International wheat council has set up a preparatory group to examine the elements of a new wheat agreement.

ANNEX IIICOCOABasic Statistics1. Statistics of production and consumption classified by main producer and consumer countries, together with prices, are given below.History of Agreements2. The International Cocoa Agreement 1972 (ICCA), the first for cocoa, came into force on 30 June 1973. Like most other commodity agreements its principalobjectives are to reduce excessive price fluctuations and to ensure supplies at prices equitable to producers and consumers. The Agreement became effective ata time of high world prices, a reflection of a tight supply situation brought about by poor harvests in 1972/73 and 1973/74. In consequence, the mechanisms of theAgreement (described in paragraph 3) have not been activated and so far theAgreement has had no influence on world market prices.Arrangements for Price Stabilisation3. The ICCA provides for a system of adjustable export quotas combined with a buffer stock of up to 250,000 tons, aimed at keeping prices within a pre- -determined range (currently 29.5 to 38.5 US cents per pound). If the world price moves above the mid-point of the range quotas are automatically andprogressively increased and eventually suspended. Sales from the buffer stockare made when the world price has risen to 1 cent below the maximum of the range. If the world price falls below the mid-point of the range, quotas areprogressively reduced and buffer stock purchasing begins.4. The buffer stock is financed by means of a levy of 1 US cent per pound im-posed upon all cocoa and cocoa products entering international trade, the yield from which is some US$ 25 million per annum. The costs of storage, handling,etc ate deducted from the proceeds payable to producer members when cocoa iseventually sold from the buffer stock. The capacity of the buffer stock was determined by reference to the largest deficit/surplus recorded in any one yearsince the war. Thus in theory it is of sufficient capacity to absorb any likelyexcess production or to have available enough cocoa to meet any likely shortfall.5. The period since 1960 may be divided into four distinct phases. Between1960 and 1965 production consistently exceeded demand, stocks built up and prices fell from a peak of 29 US cents per pound in 1960 to about 12 US centsper pound in 1965. A period of deficit followed until 1969 during which pricesrose to a peak of 42 US cents per pound. Small surpluses between then and 1971pushed prices down to about 22 US cents per pound in 1971. There followedshortfalls in production in both 1972/73 and 1973/74 causing prices to soar totheir peak of 83 US cents per pound last May.6. Had the ICCA been in force during the period under review it seems reasonable to assume that the price decline of 1960/65 and the rise of 1965/69would have been attenuated because of the combination of the buffer stock and
quotas would have relieved the pressure on producers to sell at very low prices and would have made cocoa available to consumers before prices soared.Furthermore, for producers the assurance that there was a defence againstprices falling to very low levels might have encouraged them to maintainproduction and perhaps avert the deficits of the late sixties and early seventies.

ANNEX IVCOFFEEBasic Statistics1. Statistics of production and consumption classified by main producer and consumer countries and details of the evolution of prices since 1958 aregiven below.History of Agreements2. There have been two International Coffee Agreements, in 1962 and 1968.One of the principal objectives of both was to achieve a better balance betweensupply and demand and to alleviate the hardship caused by excessive pricefluctuations. The 1962 Agreement, which was subject to many strains andstresses, was replaced by the 1968 Agreement. This finally broke down whenproducers and consumers failed to agree on adjustments to the price bracketsin the Agreement following the devaluation of the US dollar in 1971. Thecurrent Agreement merely preserves the International Coffee Organisation asa forum for renegotiation and a centre for the collection and promulgation ofinformation about coffee.3. Under the 1962 and 1968 Coffee Agreements the amount of coffee enteringworld trade was controlled by means of export quotas. These were adjusted as necessary in order to keep coffee prices within agreed price ranges. There wasno buffer stock.4. The Coffee Agreements were unable to iron out completely the fluctuations in production caused by climatic factors. However, the Agreements did play a part in reducing the level of exportable production. The export quota controlsexerted pressure on production in all producing countries. Also the Agreementsprovided for production controls and the 1968 ICA had a Diversification Fund,both of which may have played some part in reducing production. However,climatic factors were also very significant and the 1969 and 1971 frosts in Brazilreduced her production to an extent which effectively removed the surplus of coffee which had overhung the world coffee market in the late &apos;fifties and early&apos;sixties. The result was that the fall in prices in the period 1958/62 was haltedand was followed by a fairly steady increase until 1969/70 when a sharp riseoccurred as a result of the first Brazilian frost. Prices fell back in 1970/71 but when the 1968 Agreement ceased to function in 1972, prices started to rise.5. A number of lessons can be drawn from the experience of the last 12 years or so. The principal one perhaps is that when an agreement gets seriously outof line with market realities it will no longer be effective. The 1962 and 1968Agreements were designed to cope with a large surplus of coffee; as soonas that surplus disappeared coffee prices started to rise and the 1968Agreement had no means of preventing them. The stresses this put on themechanisms of the Agreement finally brought about its demise. The effective
breaking point was the failure of producers and consumers to agree on anincrease in the price ranges under the Agreement to take account of the devaluation of the US dollar in 1971, which took place after the price rangeshad been negotiated for the year.New Agreement6. Negotiation of a new International Coffee Agreement is now in progress.On the basis of discussion so far it seems likely that a new Agreement mightcontain adjustable export quota provisions similar to those of the 1962 and1968 Agreements. The idea of the inclusion of a form of coffee stock under international control in an attempt to provide consumers with some securityof supply has also gained some support.

COPPERPrice Movements4. There is a &quot;producer&apos; price for copper in the USA, and the Communistbloc of course has its own pricing arrangements. In the rest of the world theleading price is that fixed daily on the London Metal Exchange (LME), whichreflects the supply and demand position. The LME price is subject to fluctuationswhich have been particularly marked in the last two years. The average cashprice (quoted in   sterling per ton) was  197 in 1958 and remained something over  200 until 1963. Thereafter it rose sharply to  554 in 1966, and  621 in1969. It fell back to  417 in 1967 and  427 in 1972; but after 1972 it rose rapidlyto reach  1,400 at one point in April 1974. After an unprecedently sharp fallin the second half of 1974 the average price in January 1975 was  529 which in real terms is much lower than the price in the mid-sixties.5. Detailed statistics of production, consumption and prices are given below.*Recoverable copper content of ores and concentrates produced.531. Total world mine production* of copper in 1973 (the last complete year for which figures are available) was 7.5 million metric tons, of which 6 millionmetric tons was produced in the non-Communist countries. The major producersoutside the Communist bloc in order of magnitude are the USA (1.5 millionmetric tons), Canada (815,000), Chile (735,000), Zambia (706,000), Zaire(490,000), the Philippines (221,000), Peru (220,000) and Australia (218,000).Most of these countries are also substantial smelters of copper. There are largesmelting industries based on imported concentrates in Japan and W. Germany.2. The largest consumers of refined copper (excluding secondary copper)in 1973 were the USA (2.2 million metric tons), Japan (1.2 million), USSR(1.1 million metric tons), W. Germany (730,000), the United Kingdom (545,000)and France (407,000). All developed industrial countries consume copper insome degree. Total world consumption of refined copper in 1973 was 8.7 million metric tons.3. The United States are largely self-sufficient in copper (including secondaryproduction and re-used scrap). So is the Communist bloc, only Yugoslaviabeing a small net exporter. In the rest of the world, Chile, Peru, Zambia andZaire account together for 60% of the world&apos;s copper exports. Copper accounts for over 95% of Zambia&apos;s export earnings and 74% of Chile&apos;s. These four countries have joined together in the Intergovernmental Council of CopperExporting Countries (CIPEC).
History of Agreements6. There have been no formal agreements for copper in the past althoughproducers have attempted to establish a &quot;producer&apos; price from time to time. Thelast attempt was in 1964/66 but broke down under the stress of high industrialdemand and production losses which caused the LME price to increase sharply.There has been no producer pricing arrangement since then.7. In 1967, the four main exporters, Chile, Peru, Zambia and Zaire, formed the Intergovernmental Council of Copper Exporting Countries (OPEC) withthe aim of co-ordinating their copper policies. The present CIPEC countriesagreed at the end of 1974 to reduce &quot;deliveries&apos; of refined copper by 10% rising to 15 %; but not all the countries have yet cut production in order to match this reduction in deliveries. Thus there is some stockpiling.8. Producer and consumer countries are anxious about the uncertaintiesarising from fluctuations in the LME price and the prospect inter alia for investment if prices continue at the present low level.

Statistics of production and details of the evolution of prices since 1958are given below.Existing Agreements2. Three international arrangements have been introduced in the dairy products sector, concerned with whole milk powder (which began in 1963),skimmed milk powder (1969) and butteroil (1973). All are rather less compre-hensive instruments than a full commodity agreement in that the role of each isto set, and monitor the operation of, minimum export price levels for their products. All are still operative, although none has been fully tested since world prices have remained well above the minimum export price levels which thearrangements were designed to protect.New Arrangements3. The e.c., in the context of the GATT multilateral trade negotiations, islikely to propose the replacement of these arrangements by a full commodityagreement, which would also cover butter. It would provide for the setting ofboth maximum and minimum prices for each product, with the object ofstabilising the market. There would be no buffer stock./ /     h-DAIRY PRODUCTSDAIRY PRODUCTS
JUTEPrice Movements2. Prices have remained relatively low and stable until recently when the informal price agreement broke down. In January 1974 the price was  152 perton and was lagging behind other commodities in the boom. By mid-1974 ithad however reached  184 and is currently  243. Further increases can be ex-pected in 1975 because supplies have been affected by flooding in India and because growers have been switching to produce rice which provided a betterreturn.3. Detailed statistics of production and prices are given below.History of Agreements4. Commodity agreements have been under discussion by the FAO Inter-governmental Study Group (FAO/IG) since the mid-sixties but talks broke down over arrangements for financing a buffer stock. In 1968 an informalsystem was instituted in which an indicative price range is agreed annually inthe FAO/IG between producers and consumers. Until 1974, it proved possibleto reach agreement on prices which were remunerative to producers andacceptable to consumers (bearing in mind the price of synthetic substitutes). In1974, however, it proved impossible to reach agreement and the price has farexceeded the indicative price. Nevertheless the Group intends to continue the informal arrangements as far as possible.5. The cost of world stock reserves in 1968 was estimated at 73.7 millionUS$; given that the current price for jute is 70 % higher than in 1968 taxed on anaverage grade the initial purchase would be correspondingly higher today. Tothis would be added administration, insurance and warehouse costs.1. In 1973 the major producers of jute were India (1,530,000 tonnes in 1973)Bangladesh (1,100,000 tonnes) and Thailand (660,000 tonnes) who togetheraccount for some 98% of world production. The major consumers are UK(73,200 tonnes in 1973), Belgium, France and the USA. Fluctuations in supplyoccur because of crop failures but, overall, demand is declining because of competition from synthetics.

1. World production of natural rubber has increased steadily from 1.97million tons in 1958 to 3.49 million tons in 1973. In 1973 the major producerswere Malaysia (1.57 million tons), Indonesia (0.89), Thailand (0.38), Sri Lanka(0.15), India (0.12) and Liberia (0.08), and the major consumers the USA (0.70million tons in 1973), Japan (0.34), West Germany (0.21), UK (0.17), France(0.16), Italy (0.12), India (0.12) and the Communist countries (0.70). Almost allnatural rubber produced enters international trade, as the major producers arenot (with the exception of India) also major consumers.Price Movements2. There is no single price for natural rubber, as there are several differentgrades. There are major markets in London, New York, Kuala Lumpur and singapore. Market prices have shown a good deal of volatility over the years,with a year&apos;s highest price frequently being 50 % or more greater than the year&apos;slow. During the 1960&apos;s, yearly average prices tended to drift downwards, theLondon price of ore grade being  215 per ton iri: 1958,  225 in 1961, falling to a low of  152 in 1967, and then (following devaluation of the  ) rising to  222 in1969 before falling back to  144 in 1971. The average price rose to  342 per tonin 1974 as part of the world wide commodity boom (touching  515 in January1974), but had fallen back to  265 by the end of the year. The long term pricetrend for natural rubber is intimately linked with the price of synthetic rubber,which takes over half of the total world rubber market.3. Detailed statistics of production, consumption and prices are given below,and are reproduced by courtesy of the Secretary General of the IRSG.History of Agreements4. In 1953 a formal commodity agreement for rubber was proposed by theBritish Colonial and Dependent Territories Delegation to the InternationalRubber Study Group (IRSG). The proposal failed, mainly because agreement could not be reached on the basis for funding a buffer stock. Last year the FAOput forward a paper to the IRSG suggesting an informal agreement, possiblybacked by export quota control. Neither the producers nor consumers showedany real enthusiasm for the proposal.5. International arrangements in connection with the trading of naturalrubber will be discussed at the meeting of the IRSG in October 1975.RUBBER

SISAL1. World production of sisal amounted to 606,000 tonnes in 1973. The majorproducers were Brazil (230,000), Tanzania (159,000), Angola (62,000), Kenya(58,000), Madagascar (24,000) and Mozambique (22,000). The major consumers(1973 figures) were France (64,300 tonnes), Portugal (43,600), UK (39,400),Belgium (39,700,) Germany (35,900) and Italy (34,100). Demand is decliningbecause of competition from polypropylene. Although prices of the latter haveincreased with the increased price of oil, the trend towards substitution has notbeen halted.Price Movements2. Prices remained relatively stable in the early 1970&apos;s (around  80 a ton) wheninformal price stabilisation arrangements were in force but escalated in 1973( 201) and 1974 ( 465) when the arrangements broke down.Previous History of Agreements4. The situation of sisal is similar to that of jute (see Annex VII), i.e. informalarrangements consisting of indicative price levels, with the addition of exportquotas agreed according to the countries expected production in any season.At the last FAO/IG session in January 1975 there was general agreement thatthe informal arrangements should continue, even though they had been largelyinoperative because of high prices and shortages of good quality sisal. It wasalso accepted that there was a need for emergency meetings to be held, should a major change in the market situation occur, in addition to the formal sessions,and arrangements were made accordingly.5. Sisal is covered by the Lome Convention between the e.c. and the ACPstates.

SUGAR1. World production and consumption of sugar is currently just over 80 million tons per year having more than doubled over the last 20 years. Most of theincrease is in sugar consumed in the countries where it is grown. World trade insugar totals about 23 million tons. The main exporters are Cuba, Australia,Brazil, South Africa and (usually) the e.c.; the main importers are the USA,Japan, USSR and Canada. A table of world and CSA prices since 1958 is given below.History of AgreementsCommonwealth Sugar Agreement (CSA)2. The CSA, signed in 1951, was a contract by Commonwealth countries tosupply and by the UK to purchase fixed annual quantities at prices negotiatedperiodically and designed to be &quot;reasonably remunerative to efficient producers&apos;.The quantities totalled 1.7 million tons and represented some two-thirds ofUK consumption. Until 1971 the CSA price had been above the world price in16 out of the 21 year lifetime of the Agreement, representing a substantial benefitto the exporting countries. In 1972, 1973 and 1974 the position was reversed.3. During 1974 the world price rose rapidly. The CSA price effective at thebeginning of 1974 was originally negotiated in 1971, and the effects of worldinflation and the energy crisis had increased production costs and virtuallyeliminated the profit element in the CSA price. Two price increases were madeunder the CSA in 1974; the second took the price to  140 per ton to thosesuppliers who shipped in full. By the end of 1974 it was however clear that therehad been a shortfall of almost 400,000 tons.New Arrangements for the Supply of Commonwealth Sugar to the EEC4. Successor arrangements to the CSA have recently been agreed with the e.c..The Community has offered continuing access on an indefinite basis for up to1.4 million tons of sugar per year the total of the developing country quotasunder the CSA. The price is guaranteed at a level similar to that of Communitybeet producers, but in the exceptional conditions of 1975, the UK is paying asupplement on that price to bring it to  260 per ton c.i.f. In the long term, theCommunity price should itself be remunerative to the developing countryproducers.5. Apart from assuring supplies to the Community market in the long term,this agreement represents for the exporting countries a continuation of theconcepts of the CSA and will provide them with important export earnings froma guaranteed market at guaranteed basic prices.
Present Situation9. The world price of sugar is extremely volatile, moving from peaks totroughs very rapidly. Between 1956 and 1974, the price sank to  17 per ton androse to over  600. There are several causes of this volatility. First, the effect ofweather on yields of sugar from both beet and cane; second, although sugar beetis an annual crop, sugar cane, which accounts for about 55-60% of world production but over 90 % of sugar entering into international trade, is peremiial,although it requires planting every few years in order to maintain yields. Third,increased production of both beet and cane requires considerable capital investment. Fourth, a high proportion of exports is accounted for by developing countries where the scope for diversification out of sugar, or for storing sugar, is limited.10. Just under half total world trade takes place under special arrangementscovering fixed quantities at pre-determined prices. The result is that any imbalancebetween world total supply and demand is loaded onto a free market of only about 11 million tons (12% of total world production) with a disproportionateeffect on price.6. Until the end of 1974 the US covered its entire import requirements of over  million tons under a special quota arrangement; by careful management of thisquota system the authorities matched total supplies with demand to maintain aprice for imported supplies similar to that which domestic producers received.The effect of this scheme was to limit fluctuations in US domestic prices at times of high or low world prices. Existing legislation expired at the end of 1974 andno successor arrangements were made. At present the US is purchasing its sugarfrom the free market.International Sugar Agreements7. Because of the instability of the world free market, there have been successiveattempts to regulate it by international agreement. The most recent Agreementwith full economic provisions was that of 1968-1973. It relied on adjustableexport quotas to regulate the market and maintain the price within a pre-setrange. There were also provisions on maximum and minimum levels of stocks;importers&apos; minimum levels of market access; and limitation (or banning) ofimports from non-members. Most important was a &quot;ceiling price&apos; provisionrequiring exporters, in times of shortage and high prices, to offer certain quantitiesof sugar to traditional importers.8. The Agreement was generally regarded as successful in its early days.During the first three years it succeeded in raising the price well above itsunremunerative 1968 level. But after 1971, the world price rose steadily. despite the operation of the &apos;ceiling price&apos; the Agreement came under increasing pressure from both importers and exporters. When the ISA came up for renegotiation in1973, despite genuine efforts on all sides, agreement proved impossible. Thepresent ISA is purely administrative, although committed in principle to negotiate an economic agreement in due course.
11. In the absence of an effective ISA, and with uncertainty about futureworld prices, some suppliers have negotiated long term supply arrangements which afford an element of price stability. Such arrangements may cover between-3 million tons per year.WORLD SUGAR PRICESAverage Commonwealth	Average world price	Sugar Agreement	cif UK		 	 1956	35.75	40.75*1957	46.98	42.17*1958	31.38	43.84*1959	27.31	45.14*1960	28.48	44.441961	25.68	48.201962	25.59	48.801963	71.70	50.601964	51.13	51.101965	21.51	51.151966	17.87	51.251967	19.36	51.501968	21.83	52.101969	33.83	52.101970	40.06	53.251971	46.18	53.251972	72.63	62.821973	99.46	66.901974	305.13	120.93*1956-1960 (based on pre-war freight and insurance rates).
TEA1. Statistics of production and consumption classified by main producer and consumer countries together with details of price movements since 1958 aregiven below. The consumption figures are artificial in the sense that it is generallyassumed that all tea produced is consumed because it cannot be stored for long.History of Agreements2. The International Tea Agreement of 1933 which ran until 1955 was theonly International Agreement there has been on tea. Its objective was not the mere stabilisation of prices or export earnings but that of raising prices above thelevel to which they had fallen in the preceding years. It relied principally oncontrol of exports but it included provisions for restricting the growth ofproduction. This seems to be the only sort of agreement which could work effectively for the tea industry.New Agreement3. A new International Tea Agreement has been under discussion in the FAOIntergovernmental Group on Tea for some years. The reconciliation of the conflicting interests of the various parties has proved a stumbling block toprogress. Discussions were continued in 1974 and a working party of exportershas been set up to study the feasibility of an International Agreement. discussion in the Intergovernmental Group is to continue later this year. Meanwhile, an informal export quota arrangement has been operating since 1970 but this hashad no real effect on prices because the quotas have been very large.Mechanisms for Price Stabilisation4. The long term problem that has faced the world tea market has been thatof a price decline caused by production increasing more rapidly than demand.Price instability is not, therefore, the main problem and any agreement wouldprobably have as one of its objectives the reversal of the price decline. Exportquota arrangements of the traditional variety seem most likely to provide the answer to this problem provided the participating countries agreed to see thatthey were enforced. A buffer stock mechanism alone would be unable to functioneffectively in this situation as it would soon exhaust its funds through purchases.Moreover, because tea is storable only within narrow time limits, it is doubtfulwhether the buffer stock technique could be use,d even as a subsidiary means of controlling the flow of supplies. There would also be difficulties in determining the composition of the buffer stock in terms of the different types and qualities of tea, since tea is by no means a homogeneous commodity.5. The decline in tea prices as evidenced by the evolution of the LondonAuction Prices is clear with a high point of  516/ton in 1960 and a low of  411 /tonin 1969. The rise in 1970 to  464/ton is sometimes attributed to the introductionof the informal export quota controls. What seems the more likely reason is thatin that year the increase in consumption matched the increase in production for
the first time. Certainly the slightly higher prices in 1973 and 1974 were theresult of lower production, brought about by adverse weather conditions and rising production costs. It is still too early to judge whether the low returns to producers over many years will eventually result in declining production.Historical evidence gleaned from other commodities suggests that it will, but teahas been different from other tropical commodities over the last decade in having a relatively stable price.6. Such evidence as we have indicates that the long term prospect for the teamarket is of continued depressed prices. An International Tea Agreement might provide an assurance of continued price stability, and therefore more security forproducers which, particularly in the present inflationary conditions, would helpassure tea supplies in the future.PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF TEA 1958/1973 (THOUSAND TONS)Year (Calendar)	India	Sri Lanka	Kenya	Indonesia	Total*	Estimated World Consump-tion1958	246	187	11	48	685	6871959	250	187	12	44	691	6891960	237	197	14	45	690	7001961	267	207	12	43	735	7221962	341	209	16	46	735	7321963	341	216	18	39	738	7411964	367	215	20	46	780	7841965	361	225	20	I      44	801	7911966	370	219	25	39	812	8181967	379	217	22	34	813	8271968	396	221	29	41	860	8411969	387	216	35	40	858	8781970	412	209	40	43	895	9001971	429	214	36	47	925	9261972	448	210	52	49	975	9491973	462	218	56	54	NA	NA*   Estimated using total production figures for India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka,Indonesia and East Africa, and exports from other producers.Source: International Tea Committee, Bulletin of Statistics.

TIN1. Estimated world primary tin metal production for 1974 was 179,400 tonnesand for 1973 was 184,700 tonnes. These figures do not include tin production inthe USSR (a net importer) or in the People&apos;s Republic of China (a net exporter).The main producers of tin-in-concentrates in order of importance are Malaysia,Bolivia, Indonesia and Thailand. Other significant producers are Australia,Nigeria, Zaire, Brazil and the United Kingdom. The three Far Eastern producersaccount for nearly 60% and the 7 ITC producer members for about 90% of world production of tin-in-concentrates.2. Estimated world consumption (including imports into the USSR) for 1974was 209,300 tonnes and for 1973 was 219,900 tonnes. The main consumers often are USA, Japan, Federal Republic of Germany, United Kingdom andFrance. The deficit of production was met by sales from the International TinCouncil (ITC) Buffer Stock and the American GS4 stockpiles.Price Movements3. A paper presented at the 4th World Conference on Tin in October 1974showed that the price of tin in real terms stabilised for about eleven years (from1953-1963) between  800 and  900 (constant sterling 1962 prices). Following aperiod of two years (1964-65) during which the International Tin Council lostcontrol, it then found a new equilibrium between  1,020 and  1,100 (constantsterling) over the years 1966-1970. Prices (constant sterling) fell below this levelover 1971 and 1972, but the fall was limited and the price returned to the  1,100level (constant sterling) in 1973. Prices rose very sharply in 1974 but have fallenback since then, though less sharply than other non-ferrous metals. The present day price is about  3,000 (1975 prices). There is some evidence that the price often expressed in real terms has been more stable over the period 1956/1974 thanhave other non-ferrous metal prices.4. Detailed statistics of production, consumption and prices are given below.History of Arrangements5. The producer countries have co-operated since 1920. The 1st InternationalTin Agreement between producers and consumers came into force in 1956.7 producers and 22 consumer countries are members of the 4th Agreement;significant exceptions are the USA, People&apos;s Republic of China and Brazil.6. The objectives of the International Tin Council are (a) to achieve a long-term balance between supply and demand at prices remunerative to producers and fair to consumers and (b) to avoid severe short-term price fluctuations.The Council aims to achieve these objectives by buffer stock operations in theworld metal markets, and if need be, export controls. Under the 4th Agreement,the buffer stock of 20,000 tonnes (cash equivalent at floor price in 1971 is  27m) is
financed by compulsory contributions from producers and voluntary contributions from consumers (only France and the Netherlands have contributed). In the past the buffer stock has made a profit (it generally buys when the price is low andsells when it is high) and contributions have been returned with an additionalmargin at the end of each Agreement. However the cost of financing 20,000tonnes of metal has increased with each new Agreement at the present floorprice a buffer stock of 20,000 tonnes of metal would cost about  60m.7. The Fourth International Tin Agreement is due to expire in June 1976.Negotiations for a Fifth Agreement are to take place in Geneva in May and Junethis year. A number of major changes, including compulsory consumer contribu-tions to the buffer stock and the size of the buffer stock, will be discussed.8. The Tin Council is undoubtedly a valuable forum for continuing dialoguebetween producers and consumers. It has been suggested that although consumershave had the benefit of more stable prices as a result of the buffer stock,they have, in the long-term, paid a higher price for the tin than they would otherwise have done but it is difficult to prove this conclusively as it is over50 years since tin prices were last determined by market forces alone and there istherefore no suitable period for comparison.9. The buffer stock has had considerable success in defending the floor price(it has been breached only twice, both early in the life of the 1st Agreement).Export controls have had to be introduced on only four occasions (Dec 1957-Sept 1960; Sept 1968-Dec 1969; Jan 1973-Sept 1973; and April 1975). The intro-duction of export controls invariably disrupts production patterns and can delayinvestment plans so that periods of control have generally ended with sharplyrising prices. For this reason purchases by the buffer stock to delay the intro-duction of export controls has benefits for consumers as well as for producers.10. The buffer stock has been less successful in defending the ceiling. despite the sale of the buffer stock&apos;s entire holding of tin metal, the price rise in 1973/4could not be kept below the ceiling, and in fact the tin price remained above the council&apos;s ceiling for several months. It has been argued that a larger buffer stockwould be better able to defend the ceiling but it is a fact that the price was abovethe ceiling for a long period despite the sale of over 40,000 tonnes of tin metalfrom the American strategic stockpile during 1973/74.

BAUXITE-ALUMINA-ALUMINIUM1. Mined bauxite is processed into alumina which in turn becomes the principalraw material from which primary aluminium metal is smelted. Six internationalcompanies (3 American, 1 Canadian, 1 French and 1 Swiss) own, or have inter-ests in, a substantial part of the aluminium industry. As vertically integratedgroups they own, wholly or partially, a large part of all stages from mining tosemi-manufactures. Detailed figures for production of bauxite and alumina and consumption of aluminium are appended.Price Movements2. Official prices of bauxite and alumina for metallurgical purposes are not published. Most of the transfers are within or between the international companies.3. The governments of some countries of origin of bauxite take their income from the operations by imposing taxes, duties and royalties on the exportedmaterial. The recent sharp increases have had an appreciable effect on the pricepaid by the smelter operation to their alumina producing associates and in turn the bauxite producing unit.44. As a rough guide the cost of bauxite might be taken at about  5 per ton(fob) and alumina at about  50 per ton. Freight costs are appreciable and vary considerably depending on the journey. The posted price for aluminium metalingot in USA is 39 cents per lb and in UK  378 per tonne.History of Agreements5. There is a producer organisation, the International Bauxite Association(IBA). Ten countries including five of the six major producers (USSR is theexception) are members of the IBA whose stated objectives include:To promote the orderly and rational development of the bauxite industry.To secure for member countries fair and reasonable return from the exploitation, processing and marketing of bauxite and its products for theeconomic and social development of their people, bearing in mind the recognised interests of consumers.To generally safeguard the interests of member countries in relation to thebauxite industry.

IRON ORE1. Iron ore is widely distributed throughout the world, and is produced insignificant quantities in all continents. Total world mine production was794 million tonnes in 1973; the largest producers in 1972 were the USSR(208 million tonnes), USA (77), Australia (64), France (55), China (45), Canada(39), India (34), Sweden (33), Brazil (31) and Liberia (25). The major consumersin 1970 were the USSR (159 million tonnes), the 6 e.c. countries (155), theUSA (130), Japan (104) and the UK (32); the developing countries accountedfor 27 million tonnes. Until the 1950&apos;s international trade in iron ore was asmall fraction of total world production, but since then it has grown rapidly sothat in 1970 over 40% of ore produced was exported from the countries of origin; the major exporters are Australia, Canada, Sweden, Brazil, Liberia,India, USSR, Venezuela and France; the major importers are Japan, the e.c.(including the UK) and the USA. However, over half the world production of iron ore is still consumed in the country of origin.Price Movements2. There is no single world price for iron ore; prices are negotiated for individual contracts and depend on many factors including quality, iron content and transport costs. After reaching exceptionally high levels, average UK importsprices declined steadily from  5.7 per tonne in 1958 to  4.3 in 1967; since then the price has risen to  6.6 in 1973. Prices for most of the ore traded are negotiatedannually, which accounts for the lack of serious price fluctuations.3. Detailed statistics on production, consumption and prices are given below.History of Agreements4. An association of iron ore exporting countries has recently been set up.It includes Algeria, Australia, Chile, India, Mauritania, Peru, the Philippines,Sierra Leone, Sweden, Tunisia and Venezuela. There are of course many otheriron ore exporting countries. It is a consultative organisation.

LEAD AND ZINC1. This note considers lead and zinc together because they are to a largeextent produced by the same countries, subject to similar market forces and represented nationally and internationally by the same trade and industrialbodies. Both are traded on the London Metal Exchange.Basic Statistics2. With the exception of Mexico and Peru the major mine producers of leadare developed industrial countries. The majority of refined lead is produced indeveloped countries. Trade in refined metal is relatively modest. There is howevera large export trade especially from Canada, Australia and Peru in unrefined leadfor refining, principally in the USA, Western Europe and Japan.3. Mine production of zinc is concentrated in a few countries, primarilyCanada, the USA, Australia and Peru. Slab production from importedconcentrates is carried on to a substantial degree in all the major industrial countries, which largely supply their own needs. The most important importersof slab zinc are the USA (mainly from Canada) and the UK (mainly from canada, Australia and Finland.)Price Movements4. Lead is priced on a free market basis on the London Metal Exchange.Zinc is quoted on the LME but since 1964 the world&apos;s main producers outsidethe USA have combined to fix a &apos;producer&apos; price at which the bulk of world zincis traded.5. The LME prices of lead and zinc moved quite closely together until recently.Cash lead fell from an average of  73 per ton in 1958 to  56 in 1962. It rose to 115 in 1965 and thereafter fluctuated about the  100 mark until 1973 when theaverage was  175. It reached a high of  324 in February 1974 but has beensteady since August 1974 at  230-240.6. Zinc was  65 per ton for cash in 1958. After moderate fluctuations it rose to  118 in 1964 and then stayed at  100-120 until 1971. The average price rosevery sharply to  347 in 1973, when a high of  938 was touched in December andwas  529 in 1974. For some months the price has been around  330-340. the producer price of zinc remained more or less in line with the LME price until1973. It held at  300-330 throughout the LME price boom in 1974 and is nowabove the LME price at  360.7. Detailed statistics on production, consumption and prices are given below.International Arrangements8. There is an intergovernmental organisation (the Lead &amp; Zinc Study Group)under the auspices of the UN, which meets regularly to consider technical and
trade matters concerned with both metals. It undertakes detailed statisticalexercises and performs a valuable function in enabling forecasts of physicalsupply to be matched against expected demand. It does not attempt to intervene in the market or to fix prices.9. The zinc producer price has served both producers and consumers well over the years. Since only marginal quantities are sold on the LME the impact on consumers of the recent fluctuations in zinc prices has also been marginal,though acute in individual cases.LEADPRODUCTION THOUSAND TONNES	USA	USSR	Australia	Canada	Peru	Mexico	China	Yugo-slavia	Others	Total1961	243.6	369.1	262.4	163.0	128.2	187.0	88.6	93.5	861.9	2397.31962	220.4	391.1	362.9	188.7	146.5	175.9	88.6	94.5	859.3	2527.91963	235.6	393.7	399.2	177.6	140.5	171.9	88.6	99.4	832.7	2539.21964	266.0	383.8	369.0	187.1	160.4	163.8	88.6	100.0	836.2	2554.91965	280.1	390.0	355.4	271.0	167.7	166.7	90.0	95.3	897.3	2713.51966	309.4	425.0	362.4	293.2	144.8	168.2	100.0	102.6	1005.7	2911.31967	299.5	430.0	372.8	316.9	163.2	165.8	100.0	108.0	1005.3	2961.51968	339.4	440.0	387.6	329.7	164.9	161.7	105.0	111.8	1031.5	3071.61969	481.0	450.0	452.0	302.0	155.0	166.4	104.0	118.0	1043.7	3272.11970	540.3	470.0	456.7	357.2	164.0	171.6	110.0	126.7	1080.9	3477.41971	546.7	485.0	403.6	394.8	147.4	173.7	120.0	124.3	1082.2	3477.71972	584.9	495.0	396.0	376.3	189.0	161.4	125.0	120.2	1070.1	3517.91973	569.8	500.0	404.1	387.8	198.6	179.3	130.0	124.0	1070.8	3564.4Source: World Metal Statistics (World Bureau of Metal Statistics).LEADCONSUMPTION THOUSAND TONNES	USA	USSR	West Germany	UK	Japan	France	Italy	China	Others	Total1961	818.5	307.1	232.4	271.4	123.7	161.3	84.6	83.7	761.9	2844.61962	887.0	326.81	240.0	271.9	115.8	153.8	89.6	83.7	793.7	2962.31963	926.0	338.2	241.8	279.0	128.2	167.4	90.5	83.7	821.2	3076.01964	953.9	373.0	253.3	302.9	161.6	169.4	87.6	83.7	938.5	3323.91965	973.5	378.9	266.4	307.1	154.1	142.3	92.5	83.7	952.2	3350.71966	821.7	418.0	255.8	293.4	147.9	168.6	105.0	100.0	995.3	3305.71967	770.2	425.0	256.8	276.3	163.3	164.2	123.0	100.0	999.0	3277.81968	817.4	448.4	285.6	276.8	180.7	179.3	133.0	120.0	1049.0	3490.21969	955.5	460.0	314.7	275.3	187.6	198.5	146.0	130.0	1171.1	3838.71970	894.2	486.0	308.9	261.7	210.5	192.5	168.0	160.0	1189.6	3871.41971	938.9	515.0	286.5	276.7	209.7	188.4	178.0	170.0	1211.1	3974.31972	1016.3	530.0	273.5	278.4	231.1	202.0	186.0	180.0	1270.1	4167.41973	1096.5	540.0	293.7	282.2	267.3	213.7	178.0	170.0	1325.6	4367.0Source: ibid.

TUNGSTEN1. Total world figures for tungsten ores and concentrates are not availablebecause the countries of the Communist bloc do not publish statistics of their production and trade. Estimated world production has risen steadily from 28,000tonnes of tungsten in 1964 to about 38,000 tonnes in both 1972 and 1973. the major free world producers are the USA, Thailand, Republic of Korea (South),Bolivia, Canada, Portugal and Australia, all of which produced between 1,300and 3,500 tonnes in 1973. The uses of tungsten are specialised in tool making for example and in steel manufacture. Thus the major users are the industrialised countries, roughly in proportion to their industrial base (eg Japan 3,400 tonnesin 1973; UK-2,600; Germany-3,100; USA-7,000). The USSR is also a largeconsumer.2. The main reserves of tungsten ores are located in the present producing countries. However, China has some 70 % of all world reserves. She is already a dominant force in the world market and will be increasingly so in future.Price Movements3. The price of tungsten internationally is based on the twice-weekly quotationpublished in the London Metal Bulletin, which is based on the prices at whichthe most recently notified transactions took place. Chinese tungsten is sold onan offer and bid basis twice yearly at the Canton Fair.4. Tungsten has a long history of price instability. The price rose from a lowof about  380 per tonne of tungsten metal average in 1964, to  1,225 in 1968and some  2,100 in 1970. It fell back to about  1,000 for most of 1972. It rosesteadily during 1973 and 1974 to about  3,000, and has now dropped back some-what. The reasons for price instability in recent years have included theunpredictable selling policies of the Communist bloc; large disposals from theUS strategic stockpile (which still contains something like 1-J years of totalworld consumption); and variations in the outlook of the advanced technological-logical industries which use tungsten.5. Charts showing production, consumption and prices are given below.International Arrangements6. There is an UNCTAD Committee on Tungsten in which producers and consumers meet. At its last meeting in November 1974 this Committee agreed,after some years of discussions, on a statement of principle in favour of working out some means of price stabilisation. The UK supported this statement.Member countries are now examining their own requirements and their legisla-tive situation in relation to certain proposals advanced by producer countries,prior to further discussion at a meeting later in 1975.7. Any move towards stabilisation would depend on the co-operation ofChina and of the USA.

NOTES ON PRODUCTS NOT COVERED IN ANNEXES II TO XVIAgricultural Products1. The main agricultural products not dealt with in the previous Annexes areoils, oilseeds, meat, fish, vegetables and fruit including bananas.2. As far as oil and oilseeds are concerned, there are two main groups of products: oils and fats, and oilcakes and meals.They are produced from oilseeds,both temperate (eg soyabeans and rapeseed) and tropical (eg groundnuts andpalm kernels); and from marine (ie fish oil and meal) and animal (eg tallow)sources. The various types compete with each other within the two maingroups because they are to a considerable extent interchangeable in use.3. The possibilities of international arrangements for particular groups of oils have been considered under the auspices of FAO and UNCTAD. Thecomplexities of the market have always led to the conclusion that no agreement was practicable. Full-scale commodity agreements are also virtually impossiblefor meat and fish and for most fruit and vegetables because they are too perish-able to store and control.Minerals4. Further minerals which have been examined in less detail are:(a) Nickel, Molybdenum, Potash: There are unlikely to be supply problemseither on availability or price. All are currently produced primarily bydeveloped countries.(b) Platinum group metals: World production and reserves of these metalsare concentrated in South Africa (platinum) and the USSR (palladium).Because of their high value, recycling is extensive.(c) Chromium: World mine production is dominated by the USSR, SouthAfrica and the Philippines, and reserves are in the main concentrated inthese areas.(d) Manganese: An UNCTAD committee is currently examining proposalsdesigned to secure stable remunerative prices. All main producers and consumers participate in this committee.(e) Cobalt: World production of cobalt is relatively small (28,000 tonnesin 1973) and comes mainly from Zaire (55%), Zambia and Canada. It is produced as a by-product of copper and nickel mining and the future levelof production depends on the market for these two metals. In practice theprice is fixed by the Government of Zaire (which owns the copper/cobaltmine concerned) and prices have been relatively stable.(f) Phosphate rock: The major producers are currently the USA (38%),the USSR (21 %) and Morocco (17%). Other less important producers are
Tunisia, Togo, Senegal, Jordan and South Africa. Morocco and the north african countries, however, account for 50 % of world exports and are the major source of supply to countries other than the USA and USSR. Theyare likely to continue to be major suppliers in the future, although new sourceswill be developed, for example in Australia. Demand is likely to continueto rise since phosphate rock is the main commercial source of phosphorus,one of the three major plant food elements. Until recently supplies wereplentiful and prices had remained low and stable for many years. Currenthigh prices are already encouraging other countries to expand productionand develop new sources.

EXPORT EARNINGS STABILISATION SCHEMESIntroduction1. Export earnings stabilisation schemes can be designed to stabilise primarycommodity export earnings through the provision of financial flows. They donot operate on specific commodity markets and hence cannot influence theprices of commodities exported by the less developed countries. However,schemes of this kind can be compatible with international agreements whichare mainly aimed at stabilising the prices of specific commodities. The design ofany new arrangement on these lines will have to take account of two schemes the IMF compensatory finance facility and the eec&apos;s STABEX Scheme which already exist and are described in Note B.*2. Although an export earnings stabilisation scheme can be designed to stabilise and increase primary producers&apos; foreign exchange availability this raises a number of issues including(a) commodity coverage of export earnings;(b) reference level of earnings from which shortfalls can be measured;(c) the terms of the compensatory finance commercial loans or conces-sional funds; repayable or non-repayable;(d) the scale of the financial resources and the conditions on which they aremade available; and(e) the potential beneficiaries and eligibility criteria.These are examined, in turn, below.Commodity Coverage3. Ideally a scheme should cover total export earnings from visible andinvisible trade since it is fluctuations in total export earnings which affect the domestic economy of less developed countries (ldc&apos;s) and government develop-ment programmes. Alternatively a scheme might relate to earnings from exportsof primary commodities. It might include all those primary commodities whichthe UNCTAD secretariat have noted as being of particular interest to ldc&apos;s. this approach creates problems of defining primary products and also it effectivelyignores fluctuations in non-primary product trade which are significant for somedeveloping countries.4. Nevertheless if commodity earnings are taken as the basis, it would be preferable to use aggregate earnings from a specified list of commodities ratherthan a product by product approach. This would allow any losses from some commodities to be offset by gains on others before considering overall shortfallsfor compensation. It would also be simpler to relate the scheme to earnings on exports to all destinations (rather than to developed countries) and so ensurethat the provisions of any scheme do not have a disturbing effect on tradepatterns by stimulating attempts to divert trade from one market to another inorder to manipulate benefits and any repayments under a scheme.* Appendix, 1 briefly describes some past proposals which have not been implementedincluding the Anglo-Swedish Initiative on Supplementary Financial Measures atUNCTAD I.
Reference Level of Earnings5. The reference level of earning against which it would be judged whethera shortfall had occurred could be related to a past level or to expectations abouta reasonable future level or both. The most straightforward approach is toaverage the run of export earnings over a past period which might range from years up to say 6. Unless some clear cycle could be established in the export earnings from the commodities covered the length of this past period would bea fairly arbitrary decision. The reference period should also be on a movingaverage basis (ie the period immediately preceding the current operationalyear) if the reference level is not going to lose touch with current realities.6. Efforts to include expectations about the future are liable to be contro-versial and difficult, though they may be important especially if the particular country faces a long-term downward trend in its level of earnings and the schemeis designed to deal with downward fluctuations rather than with long-termdeclines. \ \Terms and Sources of Financei. Commercial Funds7. Any scheme which is not initially financed entirely by its beneficiariesinvolves a capital transfer by the other participants. If the main emphasis is tobe on helping to stabilise earnings rather than providing aid, it would be possibleto operate a scheme on fully commercial terms.8. The wealthier ldc&apos;s might be expected to have access to the internationalcapital market directly and, if there were stringent conditions attached toreceiving benefits from the scheme, might prefer to deal with fluctuations by borrowing directly from that source. Poorer ldc&apos;s however might well have con-siderable difficulty borrowing directly from the market, particularly at a timewhen their export earnings were low, certainly on terms comparable with thoseof an international agency backed by government guarantees. They might therefore find some appeal in such a scheme.9. Commercial funds could not be made available on an open-ended basis,with levels of borrowing and lending simply determined by the size of shortfalls.Limitations would be set by the capital structure and the nature of any guaran-tees. Thus there could be no guarantee that shortfalls would be fully compensatedunder a commercially financed scheme.ii. Concessional Funds10. A scheme would be easier to operate, and of course much more attractive to the intended beneficiaries, if concessional funds were used. Resources underthe scheme could be made available to beneficiaries either on a grant basis oron very concessional loan terms with flexible repayment provisions linked toimprovements in export earnings above reference levels.11. If concessional funds were used the scheme could obviously not beopen-ended and a ceiling would be required. It would be very difficult to estimatereliably what ceiling would be high enough to cover most likely fluctuation
patterns. Past patterns of fluctuations would not be a good guide to the future,and projections of future price and quantity changes on primary commodities are notoriously unreliable. The most straightforward approach in setting up ascheme would be to specify the amount of concessional resources available andthe countries which could benefit and allow the administering agency to tailorthe proportion of the shortfall covered in any one year to the ceiling availablefor all countries. This means, of course, that no beneficiaries could be certain of receiving payments which fully covered any shortfall so that economic pro-grammes could not be certain of being fully insulated by such a scheme fromthe impact of fluctuations.12. It may be possible to limit the amount of concessional funds needed tosupport a scheme by making the fund revolve to some degree. As a minimum,repayment could apply whenever earnings exceeded the reference level. an interest rate, possibly varied according to the poverty of the recipient countryand zero for the poorest, might be charged on the outstanding amounts regard-less of the situation on earnings.13. If such a scheme were able to generate additional concessional funds itcould have considerable attraction but if it drew on concessional funds whichwould in any event have been available to developing countries it raises a majorquestion about the resultant country distribution of scarce concessional funds.Would it bear any relation to a distribution based on country &apos;need&apos; determinedby factors such as the level of poverty and size of population, which are increas-ingly being accepted as the appropriate criterion for determining the countryallocation of concessional funds through traditional aid programmes? There isno a priori reason to expect that a distribution based on the size and instabilityof each recipients commodity export earnings would reflect the requirement of aid need. (This issue is discussed further in the last section of this Annex, and appendix 2 sets out some results of an illustrative statistical exercise showingthe country distribution of earnings shortfalls during the 1960&apos;s.)14. Payments under the scheme would be analogous to general balance ofpayments support and would help sustain the recipient governmenfs general development programme. Any attempt by the administering agency to linkfunds under the scheme to a number of individual projects or sectors in that programme which it would then attempt to appraise would be time consumingin a number of ways and would slow down disbursements considerably. whereas the essence of such a scheme is to get funds in quickly to counter the effect onthe economy in general, and the governmenfs development programme inparticular, of the export earnings shortfall.Conditions of Payment15. Payments could be either automatic of discretionary. Automatic payments would mean that when the specified quantifiable conditions of shortfall havebeen demonstrated to occur statistically a payment would be made. A discretion-ary system would involve such shortfalls being taken as a necessary pre-condition for payment but not a sufficient condition. The administering agencywould then extend the factors to be considered in deciding whether to make a
payment. These might include the level of earnings from exports other than the specified commodities, the level of foreign exchange reserves, the receipts on capital account both aid and commercial flows, and judgements on the futuretrend in export earnings and receipts on capital account, again both aid and thescope for commercial borrowing. The addition of these factors would give amuch clearer idea of the extent to which any shortfall in earnings from the specified commodities would disrupt development and the extent to which the potential beneficiary had the capacity to deal with any disruption from its own resources. It may also be possible to consider the extent to which the shortfallis attributable to factors beyond the control of the country concerned. a discretionary approach makes more economic sense in that it takes account ofthe total economic situation of the country in judging whether a payment isrequired.16. Whether payments are automatic or concessionary there are practical considerations which make it impossible for payments to be made during theyear or period when the shortfall is actually occurring. The most importantcause of delay is that trade data has to be produced to ascertain whether a shortfall  has taken place and this will take some time, certainly some monthsafter the end of the operational period depending on the detail required.Furthermore, if there is a ceiling on the funds available and the procedure isfollowed of tailoring all beneficiaries payments equitably so that total paymentscan be accommodated within the ceiling, the trade data for all beneficiariesneeds to be available before final payment can be made. The pace is thusheavily influenced by the slowest producers of data: though no doubt techniquesof interim payment could be devised to alleviate this kind of delay. In any event the basic point remains: during the period when the shortfall is actually takingplace the government of the country concerned must be taking measures withinthe limits of its then available resources to deal with them. Payments under astabilisation scheme will appear later. This problem can of course be easedbecause with some clear expectation of payments from any scheme the govern-ment could either run its foreign exchange reserves down to otherwise unaccept-able levels or, possibly, borrow against the future receipts. However if theamount to be received under the scheme is uncertain, because of a ceiling onthe finance available and possible claims of other beneficiaries, these optionswill be limited ones.Potential Beneficiaries17. The scheme&apos;s facilities could be made available to all the developing countries in the Group of 77 who export the primary commodities covered.However, if concessional funds are provided through the scheme it will alsobe important to ensure that their country distribution bears some relationship to different countries&apos; need for aid. This would be most important if aid fundsprovided through the scheme are not likely to be additional to aid throughnormal channels.18. One way of partially reconciling aid and commodity trade objectiveswould be to confine aid benefits under the scheme to countries with a per capitaincome of less than $200 or $400. As these criteria would exclude some of the major ldc primary product exporters it would be possible to include commodityexporters with greater than $200 (or $400) per capita for compensation financeon commercial terms only.v\i--:f:!j;.!M
APPENDIX 1PREVIOUS PROPOSALS FOR EARNINGSSTABILISATION SCHEMES1. Note B sets out the provisions of the two existing schemes of this type:the IMF compensatory financing facility and the eec&apos;s STABEX scheme.There have been a number of other proposals in the last 15 years or so, mainly inthe period leading up to and at the time of the First UNCTAD conference in geneva, which were never implemented. The provisions envisaged for each, sofar as these were firmly indicated, are set out below.A.  Supplementary Financial MeasuresFormally proposed by the UK and Sweden at the First UNCTAD in geneva in 1964 and subjected to study by the International Bank for reconstruction and Development. One important reason it did not become operative was that no sources of additional concessional funds appearedwith which to finance the scheme.Coverage: total export earnings.Reference Level of Earnings: Reasonable expectations&apos; after taking account,     of unexpected excess earnings in previous methods and alternative sources of finance including the IMF compensatory financing facility.Terms of Finance: unspecified but tailored to economic situation of thecountry and &apos;similar to those being used for the extension of developmentfinance by various international lending agencies&apos;.Amounts and Sources of Funds: estimated that $1.5 to $2 billion needed for 5 year experimental period. This was based on 20% of gross short-falls in a past period (1959/63). Assumed that bulk, if not all, financingwould come from developed countries.Conditions of Payment: discretionary with previous agreement betweencountry and administering agency on export expectations and economic policies and programmes. In event of shortfalls country expected to use a proportion of available reserves and other possible sources of financeincluding IMF regular facilities and Compensatory Financing Facility.Account would also be taken of any earnings in excess of expectations in previous periods. Country would also be expected to make any feasibleinternal adjustments which would not disrupt the development programme.Potential beneficiaries: all ldc&apos;s.
C.  Development Insurance FundProposed by UN appointed group of experts in 1961.Coverage: merchandise exports (application to single commodities examined and rejected and found &quot;impracticable&apos;).Reference Level of Earnings: average value of exports in preceding threeyears.Terms of Finance: grants and interest-free loans, to cover 50 % to 75 % ofshortfall. Loans would be repaid if in any of the following three yearsexports earnings exceeded the reference level with the proportion of excessused for repayment limited to the proportion of shortfall compensated.Balance remaining unpaid at end of three years converted into grants.Amount and Source of Funds: unspecified amounts. Contribution by allcountries on basis of export trade or, preferably, per capita income.Conditions of Payment: automatic.Potential Beneficiaries: for grants low income primary producing countries;for loans all countries.Proposed by group of experts appointed by the Organisation of american states in 1962.Coverage: merchandise exports.Reference Level of Earnings: average valueof exportsinpreceding three years.Terms of Finance: loans (interest rate unspecified). To cover two-thirds ofshortfall. Loans outstanding limited to 20 % of export earnings. Repayablein any of the following three years from two-thirds of excess of export earnings above reference level. Balance remaining unpaid at end of threeyears to be repaid in equal instalments over the next two years.Amount and Source of Funds: amount unspecified. Contributions mainly from high income countries (ie the developed).Conditions of Payment: automatic.Potential beneficiaries: all low income primary producing countries.
APPENDIX 2INTERIM RESULTS OF AN ILLUSTRATIVE STATISTICALEXERCISE ON THE COUNTRY DISTRIBUTION OF export earnings SHORTFALLS1. In the main Annex attention is drawn to the possible consequences for thecountry distribution of concessional funds if these are allocated through the mechanism of an export earnings compensation scheme rather than throughtraditional official aid channels (ie bilateral and multilateral aid programmes).The table attached to this appendix sets out a summary of the interim results ofan illustrative statistical exercise which explores this question. The table sets thedistribution of shortfalls in total export earnings among developing countriesduring the past decade against the distribution in official development assistancein a recent three year period.2. It is emphasised that these figures result from a particular set of workingassumptions about the operations of an export earnings compensation scheme.These assumptions could be varied and somewhat different results could beexpected. The data and assumptions used for the export earnings figures are setout below.(a) the exercise uses total export earnings from visible trade (includingdomestic exports and re-exports).(b) the reference level of earnings is taken as the average of earnings in thefour years preceding the current operational year.(c) the basic statistics cover the period 1959 to 1972 allowing shortfallfigures for 10 years 1963 to 1972 to be derived.(d) the trade data in national currencies is converted to a common unit(US dollars) at the official exchange rate prevailing during the year inquestion.(e) the absolute values of shortfalls is derived for each individual countryfor each year 1963 to 1972. The shortfalls for the ten year period areaggregated and a percentage distribution of the shortfalls among countriesderived. This distribution is shown in the table.3. These results need to be treated carefully. A number of points should beborne in mind.(a) There are considerable statistical problems in assembling the basic datafor a 14-year period 1959/72. Apart from complete absence of trade data insome, though mostly not very significant, cases it did not prove possible to separate earnings from re-exports and earnings from domestic exports.This may be possible with careful work on original country sources.(b) The trade figures used have all been converted to US dollars at theexchange rate prevailing during the year involved. Changes in the exchange rate from year to year against the US dollar can thus exacerbate or reducethe size of shortfalls.
(c) The shortfalls are determined in relation to the arbitrarily chosenreference level of a moving average of the preceding four years. If expectedearnings were incorporated into the reference levels the absolute amounts of the shortfalls could be increased. The effect of inflation in this kind of scheme is difficult to assess, on the one hand high rates of inflation could reduce the frequency of shortfalls on the other it might increase the absoluteamount of each shortfall.(d) The pattern of shortfalls need not automatically determine the distri-bution of any benefits under a compensation scheme though it would bethe starting point for determining any payments.(e) A compensation scheme could be based on shortfalls from earnings oncommodity trade rather than on total visible exports.4. The noteworthy features of the results so far obtained are(a) when assessed, rather crudely, in terms of groups of countries classifiedby per capita income in 1972 the share in export shortfalls of the poorest(under $201 per capita) almost exactly coincided with their share of officialdevelopment assistance (o.d.a.) for the years 1969 to 1972. However, the somewhat less poor countries ($201-$375 per capita) had a substancially lower share of the shortfalls than of o.d.a.(b) when assessed in terms of individual countries some important recipientsof o.d.a. had a very small share of export shortfalls. This included countriesin the poorest group and India, Pakistan and Kenya are notable examples.It is also striking that a fairly limited number of individual countries,including some richer ldc&apos;s, had a very substantial share of the totalshortfalls (11 countries accounted for over 70% of the value of totalshortfalls).
