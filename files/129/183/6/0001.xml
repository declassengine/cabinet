INTRODUCTIONAppointment and terms of reference .1 When the House of Commons Select Committee on Procedure inquiredin 1970-71 into the process of legislation they received a number of proposalsaimed at improving the form and drafting of Public Bills.1 Most of those proposals were beyond the scope of their inquiry, and they therefore recom-mended that the Government should appoint a committee, which would include members and officers of both Houses of Parliament, to review the form,drafting and amendment of legislation. Following the Governmenfs acceptanceof that recommendation we were appointed on 7 May 1973 by the then lord president of the Council and Leader of the House of Commons, the Rt HonJames Prior MP, and given these terms of reference.2&quot;With a view to achieving greater simplicity and clarity in statute law,to review the form in which Public Bills are drafted, excluding considerationof matters relating to policy formulation and the legislative programme;to consider any consequential implications for Parliamentary procedure;and to make recommendations&quot;.No inquiry of this kind has taken place for a hundred years, the last being thatheld by a Select Committee of the House of Commons in 1875 (see paragraph 2.13).1.2 We understood why the Government decided to exclude from ourreview the consideration of policy formulation and the management of thelegislative programme since these are issues of the closest importance to the government&apos;s conduct of its own business. We noted, however, that the SelectCommittee on Procedure, upon whose recommendation we were appointed,proposed that our terms of reference should be&quot;to review the form, drafting and amendment of legislation and thepractice in the preparation of legislation for presentation to Parliament&quot;,which would have made it possible for us to study the way in which policy decisions on particular Bills lead to the preparation of instructions to the draftsman. This stage in drafting has a vital influence on the framing of Billsas they are presented to Parliament. The management of the Governmenfslegislative programme also has an important bearing on the form and drafting of Bills. But these topics were excluded from our review. We quickly saw thatthese restrictions would prevent us from making some recommendations on thepreparation of legislation which the Government might find helpful, and through our Chairman we so informed the Lord President of the Council.The Government accepted that in the course of our review we would inevitablytouch on questions that might not strictly be within our terms of reference;and they agreed that if there were any matters relating to Ministerial respon-sibility for the drafting of legislation on which we had observations our chairman HC 538, paragraph 68.        2 HC Deb., 656, cc 95-6.
could write privately to the Prime Minister about them. These arrangementsoriginally made with the Government by which we were appointed, wereconfirmed by the present Government in April 1974.1.3 In interpreting our terms of reference we have limited ourselves to making recommendations about the form and drafting of legislation of the Parliamentof the United Kingdom, but our Report may also be of use to those who infuture may be responsible for Bills presented to any assembly upon whichlegislative powers may be devolved. We were not concerned with subordinate legislation, which has recently been the.subject of inquiry by the Joint SelectCommittee on Delegated Legislation (The Brooke Committee).1 As we were appointed several months after the United Kingdom entered the european economic Community (e.c.) we decided to consider what effect this wouldhave upon the form and drafting of the legislation of the United kingdom parliament.Method of working1.4 It became clear early in our discussions that there were several topics of aspecialised nature which should first be examined in some detail by smallerworking groups of members of our Committee. We therefore appointedSub-Committees to investigate the following aspects:(i) Scotland.(ii) Northern Ireland.(iii) The effect of the United Kingdom entry into the e.c. upon the drafting and interpretation of UK legislation.(iv) The use of computers in relation to legislation.(v) Parliamentary procedure affecting the drafting of legislation.The Sub-Committees each prepared reports which were then considered andlargely agreed upon by the main Committee. These are not reproduced in thisReport since they were primarily intended to be working documents for themain Committee in its review of the whole field.1.5 The main Committee has met on 47 occasions. All meetings, except forone in the House of Lords and one in the Parliamentary Counsels Office, were held in the office in Whitehall placed at our disposal by the Government.The Scottish Sub-Committee met in Edinburgh on behalf of the main Committeeon three occasions to hear evidence from Scottish witnesses. Our work was interrupted and unavoidably delayed by the two General Elections in 1974.Evidence1.6 Shortly after we were appointed we invited a number of representative bodies whose views we felt would be of special importance, to submit writtenmemoranda. We also received written evidence from other organisations and individuals. A list of those who submitted evidence is given in Appendix A.1.7 We invited some witnesses to supplement their written evidence by givingoral evidence and others to discuss their views informally with us. Those wit-nesses who gave oral evidence or who had discussions with us are also listed inAppendix A. A verbatim record was made of all the oral evidence we heard.1 Report from the Joint Committee on Delegated Legislation, 1971-72 (HL 184; HC 475);Second Report from the Joint Committee on Delegated Legislation, 1972-73 (HL 204; HC 468).
1.8 Both the written evidence we received and the transcripts of the oral evidence are voluminous, and although it is of considerable interest, we havedecided that we could not justify the cost of printing it for publication. We have therefore preferred when referring to evidence given, to quote the actual wordsused by our witnesses, whether in their written memoranda or in oral evidence.Complete sets of the written and oral evidence we have received have beendeposited in the Public Record Offices in London, Edinburgh and Belfast,and in the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth.1.9 We are deeply grateful to the distinguished and busy people who devotedso much of their time to giving us the benefit of their knowledge and experience,especially those who came from far across the sea. Each of them took greattrouble in giving us their views on the difficult and often complex problems involved. Although we have paid great attention to all of the evidence andopinions we received, we alone accept responsibility for our conclusions andrecommendations.Responsibility for Improvement1.10 We must add that little can be done to improve the quality of legislationunless those concerned in the process are willing to modify some of their mostcherished habits. We have particularly in mind the tendancy of all governments to rush too much weighty legislation through Parliament in too short a time with or without the connivance of Parliament, and the inclination of Members ofParliament to press for too much detail in Bills. Parliamentarians cannot have it both ways. If they really want legislation to be simple and clear they must accept Bills shorn of unnecessary detail and elaboration. We cannot emphasisetoo strongly that the Government and Parliament have clear responsibility forthe condition of the statute book.Membership1.11 There has been no change in the membership of the Committee since we were appointed. However, Mr Ivor Richard QC, who was a Member ofParliament from 1964 to February 1974, was appointed in March 1974 to beUnited Kingdom Representative at the United Nations in New York, and hehas been unable to attend any of our meetings since then. The present lord president of the Council agreed, however, that Mr Richard should remain amember of the Committee; he has received copies of all our papers and hassigned this Report.Our Secretariat1.12 We wish to place on record our real admiration of the work done for us by Mr Angus Macpherson, our Secretary, and Mr Robert Cumming, ourAssistant Secretary, both of the Cabinet Office. They have displayed outstandingskill and diligence in marshalling and mastering the large amount of evidence we received, coping with a mass of working papers and having everythingpromptly ready when we needed to consider it. Upon them also fell the mainburden of preparing successive drafts of the chapters of our Report. We oweto each of them our heartiest thanks, as we do also to Miss G Bickford, ourClerk and Shorthand Typist, whose industry and patience throughout our workwere of great value.
Chapter IIHISTORICAL background the GROWTH OF THE STATUTE BOOKEarly enactments2.1 The classic definition of a statute by Sir Edward Coke (1549-1634) requires that it shall have received the &quot;threefold assent&quot; of Monarch, Lords, andCommons; but some of the earliest English legislation (including Magna Carta)did not fall within this definition. It consisted of acts established by royalauthority, and there was little distinction in practice between those passed bythe King in Council, or in a Parliament of magnates, or in a Parliament ofmagnates and commons. Something like a common form of enactment appears from the Statute of Westminster II (1285) onwards, and a clear distinctionbetween statutes and legislative acts of less authority emerges towards the endof the 15th century. Even so, when the first official collection, Statutes of the realm, was published by the Record Commission (1810-1828) the object wasto include among the pre-Union English statutes all early English instrumentsthat had been &quot;for a long series of years referred to and accepted as statutesin the courts of law&quot;, and any intention to attribute degrees of authority tothem was expressly disclaimed.2.2 In Scotland a definition similar to Coke&apos;s was enunciated by Craig, who,writing in the 17th century, stated that &quot;the decrees and statutes passed by thethree estates of the realm with the royal assent form the proper material of the written law of Scotland&quot;. It is probable that a considerable amount of legislationbefore 1424 did not fall strictly within that definition, but unfortunately manyof the public records relating to that period have been lost and the reliability of apparently relevant documents is sometimes uncertain. However, when inthe 19th century, not long after the publication of Statutes of the Realm, acollection-known as the Record Edition of the recognised post-1424 ScottishActs was officially prepared, the editors, Thomas Thomson and Cosmo Innes,included in it a scholarly reconstruction of some of the earlier material (not all,strictly speaking, &quot;statutes&quot;) compiled from incomplete and sometimesinaccurate sources.The present statute book2.3 The published volumes containing &quot;the statute book&quot;1 are described in chapter V. Acts of Parliament have been broadly classified in two main categories: Public Acts or &quot;Statutes&quot;, which are applicable to the generalcommunity, and Private Acts which concern the particular interest of a privateperson, public company or corporation, or local authority, and now form aJIt will be apparent that there is not in the physical sense a single book containing all the statutes. In this report we use the expression &quot;the statute book&quot; to mean, according to context,the surviving body of enacted public law or the volumes published by authority in which it isfor the time being set out.
distinct category as &quot;Local and Personal Acts&quot;. During the seven centuriessince the enactment of the earliest statute (1235) recorded in Statutes of the realm, many thousands of statutes (ie, public as distinct from private Acts)have been enacted; despite repeals and consolidation,1 3,480 &quot;public generalActs of Parliament&quot; were still in force in whole or in part at the beginningof 1974.2THE DRAFTING OF STATUTESEngland and WalesBefore 18692.4 In the earliest times statutes were drafted, in Latin or Norman French,by a committee of judges, counsellors and officials, in response to a petitionor bill which asked for a remedy but left the terms of the remedial act to theKing in Council. In the 15th century the practice began of drafting bills in theform of the act desired. By the end of that century this became the establishedmethod and the earlier practice had been discontinued. After 1487, Parliamentappears to have handed over the drafting of Bills (in English)3 to conveyancers,and &quot;from the laconic and often obscure terseness of our earliest statutes,especially when in Latin, we swung in the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenthcenturies to a verbosity which succeeded only in concealing the real matterof the law under a welter of superfluous synonyms&quot;.4 During the first half ofthe 19th century Government departments continued to farm out Bills to members of the Bar, but in addition various individuals were employed asParliamentary draftsmen in the Treasury, and later in the Home Office.1869 Onwards2.5 The Parliamentary Counsel Office was established by the Treasury in1869, and was at first staffed with the Home Office draftsman, Henry Thring,and only one assistant. They became the draftsmen of the great bulk of Govern-ment legislation. It was only in 1917 that a third Parliamentary Counsel wasappointed. A fourth was added in 1930, and two permanent assistants in 1934.The Office has since grown to its present strength of 23 (see Chapter III).2.6 Since the establishment of the Parliamentary Counsel Office, government bills, except those relating exclusively to Scotland or Ireland, have generallybeen drafted by Parliamentary Counsel. In the case of Bills applying to scotland as well as to England and Wales there is a process of co-operation betweenParliamentary Counsel and the Scottish draftsmen, outlined in Chapters iii and XII. There have, however, been some famous major exceptions such asthe Sale of Goods Act 1893 (Sir Mackenzie Chalmers, before he joined theParliamentary Counsel) and the 1925 legislation reforming the law of property in land (Sir Benjamin Cherry and Sir Arthur Underhill). The present draftingarrangements (including those for Northern Ireland) are described in Chapter III.1 We were told that in July 1973 nearly 200 of the public general Acts in force wereconsolidation Acts.2 HL Deb., 349, c 940.3 The first Commons Bill in English was of 1414.4 Allen, Law in the Making, Seventh Edition, p 482.
scotland .7 Scottish legal commentators do not seem to have been very interested inthe method of fabrication, as distinct from the content, of the statutes andthere is surprisingly little information about the history of this. Sir GeorgeMackenzie (1636-1691), however, tells us that &quot;the laws were drafted by thosewho administered them&quot; presumably meaning the Lord Advocate and the judges of the Court of Session. From the Union until the last quarter of the19th century it is thought that the work was commissioned from variousprivate practitioners on an ad hoc basis. It was not until 1871 (two years afterthe establishment of the office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Treasury)that any systematic arrangement was introduced. In that year the Treasurysanctioned the appointment of a Parliamentary Draftsman for Scotland,remunerated by salary, but some work continued to be farmed out to othercounsel, including the Legal Secretary to the Lord Advocate, on a fee basis,and the salaried post was at various times either unfilled, or held by the SeniorCounsel to the Scottish Office for Private Legislation Procedure. In 1925 thepost was formally combined with that of the Legal Secretary, and in 1934an assistant Legal Secretary and second Parliamentary Draftsman wasappointed. There are now eight full-time draftsmen, who combine their draftingduties with work as legal secretaries to the Lord Advocate.REVISION AND REFORMEarly complaints and proposals.8 As long ago as the 16th and 17th centuries there were in England manyexpressions of dissatisfaction with, and projects for reforming, the drafting of statues and the shape of the statute book. These early critics includedEdward VI (&quot;I would wish that ... the superfluous and tedious statuteswere brought into one sum together, and made more plain and short, to theintent that men might better understand them&quot;), Lord Keeper Sir NicholasBacon (&quot;a short plan for reducing, ordering, and printing the Statutes of the realm&quot;), James I (&quot;divers cross and cuffing statutes . . . [should] be oncematurely reviewed and reconciled; and . . . all contrarieties should be scrapedout of our books&quot;), and Sir Francis Bacon, when Attorney General (&quot;thereducing of concurrent statutes, heaped one upon another, to one clear anduniform law&quot;).2.9 In Scotland, too, there have been complaints and attempts at reformfrom early times onwards. In 1425 a commission was appointed &quot;to see and examine the bukis of law of this realme . . . and mend the laws that needsamendment&quot;; and several other commissions with similar purposes followedover the years, with differing results. In the 19th century and in recent yearscomplaints have centred mainly on the technique of legislating for scotland by way of a Bill altered, with varying degrees of clumsiness and complexity,to fit, more or less, into the Scottish legal system a technique which is clearlyliable to cause inconvenience (at least) to Scottish practitioners.2.10 There is a familiar ring, too, in the words of Thomas Jefferson, one ofthe &quot;revisers&quot; appointed after American Independence to survey the Parlia-mentary statutes pre-dating Independence and select those which the new state
should re-enact. It was decided, he says, &quot;to reform the style of the later Britishstatutes and of our own acts of Assembly, which, from their verbosity, theirendless tautologies, their involutions of case within case and parenthesiswithin parenthesis, and their multiplied efforts at certainty by saids andqforesaids, by ors and by ands, to make them more plain, do really render them more perplexed and incomprehensible, not only to common readers but tothe lawyers themselves.&quot; The incompatibility of certainty with simplicity andclarity (see Chapter X) is no new discovery. Jefferson&apos;s own solution, whichrather begs the question, was to aim at &quot;simplicity of style ... so far as was safe&quot;.Statute Law Commissions2.11 In the compilation of the Statutes of the Realm (1810-1828) no attempt was made to discard what was obsolete. From 1834 onwards, however, in a move towards revision, a number of commissions sat. The First Report of theStatute Law Commissioners (1835) contained some severe comment on &quot;theimperfections in the statute law&quot;, but it was not until 1861 that the series ofStatute Law Revision Acts began. These have, over the years, got rid of a large quantity of obsolete matter: one Act of 1867 alone repealed 1,300 statutes.The Statute Law committee.12 This Committee was established in 1868 to prepare an edition of StatutesRevised. Its subsequent history and activities are outlined, and the successiveeditions of Statutes Revised described, in Chapter V. We recommend in chapter XVIII that it should assume some fresh responsibilities for scrutiny of legislation.The Select Committee of 18752.13 A Select Committee of the House of Commons was set up in 1875 toconsider &quot;Whether any and what means can be adopted to improve the manner and language of current legislation&quot;. This was a resumption of an inquirywhich had been referred to another Select Committee in 1857 as a result of aReport from the Statute Law Commissioners. The Commissioners had criticisedthe confused and unsatisfactory state of the statute book, the verbose andobscure language in which statutes were drafted, uncertainties about the effects of new legislation on existing law, and confusion resulting from ill-consideredamendments made in Parliament. They had suggested the appointment of anofficer or Board to whom either House might refer Bills for advice on theireffects on existing law, their language and structure, and the repeals and amendments to be effected by them. The 1857 Select Committee was overtakenby a dissolution of Parliament before it had made any recommendations. The1875 Select Committee expressed approval of the institution of the Office ofParliamentary Counsel, and took the view that the evils arising from allegedimperfections of drafting were now comparatively few, though they criticisedreferential legislation in one of its forms: the method of drafting by which a reference is made to parts of other Acts of Parliament, &quot;some of which are
repealed, some amended and others kept alive subject to the conditions con-tained in the amending Bill&quot;. They rejected the Commissioners&apos; suggestion thatBills might be referred by either House to a scrutinising officer or Board. TheSelect Committee&apos;s own suggestions were that Bills should be accompanied(as they now are) by explanatory memoranda; that model clauses might be prescribed for general use; that an Act dealing with interpretation should be passed (as was done in 1889); and that amendments of substance introduced in Parliament should be tidied up by the Government draftsman in consultationwith the department concerned (as is now the practice, subject however tocertain limitations).2.14 A further topic dealt with by the Select Committee was consolidation:the process of repealing a group of statutes or parts of statutes relating to some particular branch of the law and re-enacting them in a single Act. In 1875this was something of a novelty, and the Committee devoted attention to thequestion of the proper form of consolidation Bills and the best method of getting them through Parliament. Questions put by members of the SelectCommittee to various witnesses suggest that they had come to think that theHouse might refrain from criticising technical amendments to be made by aconsolidation Bill if the Bill had been examined by a Committee which had gained the confidence of Parliament.The Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills2.15 The practice did in fact grow up towards the end of the nineteenth centuryof referring specific consolidation Bills to a Joint Committee of both Houses.The Joint Committee was originally set up in 1892 to consider Statute law revision Bills only, and the first consolidation Bill was referred to it in 1894.It was appointed ad hoc and not until 1921 did it become the practice for a JointCommittee to be set up every session for all the consolidation and Statute law revision Bills of the session. Since the establishment of the Law Commissionsin 1965 (see below) the jurisdiction of the Joint Committee has been widenedso as to enable it to consider (a) consolidation Bills incorporating amendments of the law recommended by one or both of the Commissions, and (b) Billsrecommended by one or both of the Commissions for the repeal of enactmentswhich are no longer of practical utility. In 1971 the Joint Committee was established by Standing Orders of both Houses. Its present functions, and the categories of Bills referred to it, are described in more detail in Chapter IV.Consolidation: The Parliamentary draftsmen^ contribution2.16 Until 1966 the planning and execution of programmes of consolidation(and, from 1956 to 1966, of Statute Law Revision) was in the hands of theGovernment draftsmen, under the supervision of the Statute Law Committee.According to Sir William Graham-Harrison (writing in 1935), 109 consolidationActs were passed between 1870 and the end of 1934. Between 1947 (when aseparate consolidation branch was set up in the Parliamentary Counsel Office)and 1966 (when responsibility was assumed by the Law Commissions) about100 consolidation Acts were passed, and it was estimated in 1966 that between one-fifth and one-sixth of the total of living statute law was contained in the consolidation Acts passed during this period.
The Law Commissions2.17 In 1965 the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission were established by the Law Commissions Act of that year, &quot;for the purpose of promoting the reform of the law&quot; (section 1(1)). Section 3(1) defines their duties in the following terms:&quot;It shall be the duty of each of the Commissions to take and keep underreview all the law with which they are respectively concerned with a viewto its systematic development and reform, including in particular thecodification of such law, the elimination of anomalies, the repeal ofobsolete and unnecessary enactments, the reduction of the number of separate enactments and generally the simplification and modernisation of the law&quot;.The subsection then goes on to list various specific activities to be undertaken by the Commissions in pursuance of their duties. These activities include thepreparation, at the request of the Lord Chancellor (in the case of the ScottishLaw Commission, at the request of the Lord Advocate), of &quot;comprehensiveprogrammes of consolidation and statute law revision&quot;, and the preparation of draft Bills to implement such programmes when approved. Programmes wereprepared by the Law Commission in 1966 and 1971 and by the Scottish law commission in 1966 and 1973, and considerable progress, to which reference is made in Chapter XIV, has been made in implementing them. The general responsibility for consolidation work, and for work on the tidying up of thestatute book by statute law revision and statute law repeals, is in the handsof the two Law Commissions.
Chapter IIIPRESENT DRAFTING arrangements the DRAFTSMENParliamentary CounselStatus and numbers3.1 The Parliamentary Counsel Office was established by Treasury Minute in1869. The title of the head of the Office is First Parliamentary Counsel. Counselare members of the English Bar or solicitors qualified in England, and are civilservants subject to the Official Secrets Act. They number at present 23 (first parliamentary Counsel, two Second Parliamentary Counsel, six Counsel, oneDeputy Counsel, six Senior Assistant Counsel, and seven Assistant Counsel).The Prime Minister, as Minister for the Civil Service, is responsible for theadministration of the Parliamentary Counsel Office, but Ministerial responsi-bility for the drafting of any particular Bill lies with the Minister in charge ofthe Bill. The Leader of the House of Commons is responsible in general forthe Governments legislative programme, but not for the contents of any Billunless he is one of its sponsors.Duties3.2 The prime duty of Parliamentary Counsel is to draft Bills for the Govern-ment&apos;s legislative programme. In addition, under arrangements made when theLaw Commissions were established, a minimum of four members of the office should at any one time be exclusively engaged in drafting Bills (includingconsolidation Bills) for the Law Commission. The intention was that a fifthmember of the Office should in,due course be assigned exclusively to law commission work. Since that time the normal practice has been for twoParliamentary Counsel and two assistant Counsel to be assigned exclusively to law Commission work. Unfortunately, at the present time only one Parlia-mentary Counsel and two assistant Counsel (three in all) are assigned exclusively to Law Commission work and we revert to this matter in paragraph 8.19 below.Some consolidation Bills are drafted in the main Parliamentary Counsel Office.Draftsmen are assigned from the Office to assist, at varying stages, in thepreparation and amendment of Private Members&apos; Bills, in both Houses, thatare supported, or at least not opposed, by the Government. parliamentary counsel also advise Ministers and officials on questions concerning Parlia-mentary practice and procedure, constitutional matters, and, on occasion, theinterpretation of statutes. Other commitments, which have been reduced inrecent years, have included the giving by members of the Office of courses oflectures, wholly or mainly for overseas lawyers, on the techniques of drafting.At one time a considerable amount of subordinate legislation was drafted inthe Office, but nearly all of it is now drafted in the legal branches of Governmentdepartments, as is the case with the subordinate legislation of Scottishdepartments.
Scottish Parliamentary DraftsmenStatus and numbers3.3 The Parliamentary Draftsman for Scotland and his colleagues are all members of the Lord Advocated Department. The authorised complement isfive senior and six junior draftsmen, and one part-time draftsman. There areat present in post six senior draftsmen (one on special promotion), two juniors,and a part-time draftsman who, with one of the seniors, is seconded to theScottish Law Commission. All the draftsmen in post are members of the faculty of Advocates, though solicitors are also eligible. The Lord Advocatehas general responsibility for the draftsmen. Responsibility for any given Billlies with the Minister whose Bill it is.Duties3.4 The duties of the draftsmen as such (other than those seconded to theScottish Law Commission) are to draft Scottish Bills in the Governmentlegislative programme, and the Scottish element of Bills applying to scotland as well as to England and Wales. All these draftsmen are also legal secretaries to the Lord Advocate, in which capacity their work involves advising andassisting the Scottish Law Officers in the discharge of their functions (other thanprosecutions); giving advice on Scots law to United Kingdom departments andsome primarily English departments; work in relation to international con-ventions and European Community matters; and generally the work corres-ponding to that performed by the legal (as distinct from the administrative)side of the Lord Chancellors Office in respect of England.Northern Ireland Legislative Draftsmen3.5 The Office of the Legislative Draftsmen in Northern Ireland consists of eight draftsmen and a part-time consultant on matters relating to law reform.They used to draft the Bills of the Parliament of Northern Ireland and nowdraft the Measures of the Northern Ireland Assembly. In the case of Westminster,legislation extending to Northern Ireland they are consulted by parliamentary counsel, and if a Bill needs adaptations for Northern Ireland these are settled by British and Northern Ireland draftsmen in co-operation.Other draftsmen3.6 The First Parliamentary Counsel has authority to make arrangementsfor some Government Bills to be drafted by outside draftsmen. Much work has been done by former Parliamentary Counsel after their retirement from government service, both for the Law Commission and on Bills in theGovernments legislative programme. Some of the drafting work of the law commission is done by lawyers who have previously been employed, not in theParliamentary Counsel Office, but elsewhere in the public service, at home oroverseas. Parliamentary Agents (normally engaged by the promoters of PrivateBills) have on occasion been employed on the drafting of Government Bills,and it is hoped that they will continue to make a contribution. On the otherhand, the prospects of engaging part-time draftsmen from the academic world and the practising Bar are so far not encouraging.
3.7 Private Members&apos; Bills are usually drafted by the Government draftsmenfrom the outset only if they have been fostered by the Government, though anyothers that reach the statute book are likely to have received some measure of drafting assistance from a Government draftsman.METHODS OF work  the draftsman and his clientsGovernment Bills3.8 Parliamentary Counsel are in most instances instructed by the Governmentdepartment most closely concerned with the subject matter of a government bill, through a member or members of its legal staff. The instructions may inpractice be in varying degrees formal or informal, but in principle they areexpected to contain a sufficiently detailed statement of what the Bill is to achieve and as much background information as may be necessary. They donot take the form of a draft Bill, and do not as a rule attempt to dictate the formor language of the Bill itself. The instructions are sent to First parliamentary counsel and allocated as described in paragraph 3.11 below. A draft Bill is thenprepared by the draftsman in consultation with officials of the instructingdepartment, working with the draftsman as an expert team. Sizeable Bills usuallygo through half a dozen or more prints before introduction into Parliament,and will often be extensively amended in Parliament. There is usually great pressure to get things done quickly, both before and after introduction, andthis makes the draftsman&apos;s task much more difficult. Such pressure is sometimesunavoidable, especially in the weeks following a change of government. The workof Parliamentary Counsel during the passage of a Bill through Parliamentincludes the drafting of financial and other motions and amendments moved by the Government; advising the department concerned with the Bill onOpposition and back-bench amendments and on questions of parliamentary procedure; attending at sittings of both Houses (and Committees of thoseHouses) when the Bill is under discussion; and co-operation with Officers ofboth Houses.3.9 In the case of a Bill applying to Scotland only, what is said in paragraph 3.8above applies in the same way as to the Bills there mentioned, but with theScottish Parliamentary Draftsman taking the place of Parliamentary Counsel.In the case of Bills involving Scotland as well as England and Wales the depart-mental instructions are sent to the Scottish Parliamentary Draftsman as wellas to Parliamentary Counsel. The Bill is initially drafted by parliamentary counsel, who as soon as practicable sends a copy of his draft to the Scottishdraftsman. The Scottish draftsman then considers how much of the draft can beadopted as it stands for Scotland, how much can be adopted with suitableadaptations, and how much must be discarded and replaced with separate,though parallel, Scottish provisions. A process of interchange of drafts and consultation then takes place between the two draftsmen, assisted by thedepartmental officials and legal advisers, until the Bill is ready for introduction;and thereafter the Scottish draftsman, when necessary, provides the like services in relation to the Scottish aspect of the Bill as does the Parliamentary Counselin relation to the Bill as a whole.
Private Members&apos; Bills3.10 When a private Member is given drafting assistance by the Government,minor questions of policy are likely to arise which Parliamentary Counsel (orthe Scottish Parliamentary Draftsman as the case may be) may not be able to answer without consulting at least one Government department. In practice heacts largely on instructions from officials of a department conversant with thesubject matter. Where assistance is not provided by the Government draftsmen,it is for the Member himself to obtain such professional drafting help as herequires. To help meet the cost of this, a Member who has secured one of thefirst ten places in the ballot for Private Members&apos; Bills is entitled to a paymentof not more than  2001. There is no similar arrangement for the House ofLords.Office organisation.11 Both in the Parliamentary Counsel Office and in the office of the Parlia-mentary Draftsman for Scotland, the head of the office is regarded as primusinter pares. He drafts some Bills himself, and allocates the others among hissenior colleagues. The senior draftsmen are regarded as professional counselwith full individual responsibility for their work; juniors are each attached toand work with a senior draftsman, the ideal being that draftsmen should operate in pairs on a Bill of any magnitude. It is mainly in this way that recruits to thetwo offices are at present trained, though First Parliamentary Counsel hasrecently re-examined the possibility of assigning one senior draftsman, for partof his time, to giving more formal instruction to recruits, and hopes to try this as an experiment.1 This was authorised by a resolution of the House of Commons on 29 November 1971pursuant to a recommendation in the Second Report from the Select Committee on Procedure,1970-71 (H.C. 538), paragraphs 56 and 70(26).
OUTLINE OF PRESENT LEGISLATIVE PROCEDURE for public BILLSGOVERNMENT BILLSIntroduction into Lords or Commons4.1 The Government decide whether a Bill is to be introduced first into theHouse of Lords or into the House of Commons. Finance Bills are alwaysintroduced in the Commons, as are most Bills which are regarded as politicallycontroversial.Procedure in the House of CommonsIntroduction and First Reading4.2 A Government Bill introduced in the House of Commons is presented bya Minister. On presentation the Bill is formally read a first time and ordered tobe printed. The Bill is then published and becomes available to the House andto the public. It is usual for a Bill to have attached to it an Explanatory andFinancial Memorandum, or an Explanatory Memorandum if the Bill has nofinancial effect. The Memorandum includes a forecast of any changes in public sector manpower requirements expected to result from the passing of theBill; it must be framed in non-technical language and contain nothing of anargumentative character. A Government Bill brought from the Lords is deemedto have been read a first time and ordered to be read a second time in the commons when a Minister informs the Clerks at the Table of his intention totake charge of it.Second Reading4.3 When Members and the public have had time to consider the Bill (and, ifthe Bill is urgently required, in a much shorter time) a day is appointed for theSecond Reading. The debate on Second Reading is concerned with the main principles of the Bill as a whole, but reference to alternative methods of achieving the objects of the Bill is permitted. The debate normally takes place on the floor of the House, and at its conclusion the Bill is given a Second Reading (whetherunopposed or on a division). It could be rejected, in which case nothing more would be heard of it. Bills relating exclusively to Scotland usually have their second Reading debate in the Scottish Grand Committee, which includes allthe Members representing Scottish constituencies. Similarly a small number ofnon-controversial Bills are sent for discussion of their principles to a SecondReading Committee, consisting of 16 to 50 Members nominated for each occasion having regard to Members&apos; qualifications and the party composition of.the House. The Committee report to the House whether they recommend thatthe Bill be read a second time or not, and the House decides without amend-ment or debate whether or not to accept the Committee&apos;s recommendations.
Committee Stage4.4 When a Bill has received a Second Reading it will in most cases be sentto a Standing Committee; although for various reasons, especially when a Billis of a constitutional nature, it can have its Committee Stage on the floor of theHouse. Standing Committees consist of from 15 to 60 Members who are specially appointed for each Bill so as to reproduce as nearly as possible theparty composition of the. House. A money resolution providing the necessary funds must have been passed on the floor of the House, after the SecondReading of the Bill, before any clause that makes a charge on public fundscan be taken in Committee.4.5 The Committee Stage is the main opportunity for detailed considerationof a Bill, and the stage at which most amendments are moved. The proceedings are substantially the same whether this stage is taken in a Standing committee or in Committee of the whole House. The Committee goes through the Billclause by clause, first considering amendments to the clause (selected by theChairman in his discretion) and then debating the motion that the clause, orthe clause as amended, &quot;stand part of the Bill&quot;; the Chairman may, however,rule that there shall be no debate on &quot;clause stand part&quot; if in his opinion theprinciple of the clause has been adequately discussed in the course of debate on amendments. After the clauses of the Bill have been disposed of, proposed new clauses are similarly dealt with, followed by the Schedules to the Bill and proposed new Schedules, and finally the preamble, if any, and the long title.Changes in the sequence of consideration may be made if the Committee sodecide. Most &quot;Scotland-only&quot; Bills are committed to a Standing committee composed mainly of Scottish Members.Report Stage4.6 When the proceedings of a Committee of the whole House on a Bill are concluded, the Bill is reported to the House at the next sitting. In either case,a later day is usually appointed for its further consideration at what is called the Report Stage. (A Bill reported from a Committee of the whole Housewithout amendment proceeds, however, directly to Third Reading.) At theReport Stage, the entire Bill is open to consideration: new clauses and Schedulesmay be added and amendments made (the new clauses being taken first), but no question is put on each clause that it stand part of the Bill unless it be anew clause. The Speakers selection of amendments and new clauses for debatetends to be stricter than at the Committee Stage. All Government amendmentswill, however, normally be selected, and any non-Government amendments onsubjects to which the Government had at the Committee Stage promised furtherconsideration. When all amendments have been disposed of the Bill goes toThird Reading.Third Reading4.7 The motion for the Third Reading of a Bill is normally put immediately on the conclusion of the Report Stage, and the question is put without debateunless notice has been given by not less than six Members of an amendment tothe question or of a motion that the question be not put forthwith so thatthere may be a debate. Debates on Third Reading are becoming rare, but where one does take place it is limited strictly to the contents of the Bill. Onlyminor verbal amendments can be made to a Bill on Third Reading: if material
amendments are necessary the order for Third Reading must be dischargedand the Bill recommitted to allow the amendments to be introduced in aresumed committee proceeding.Procedure in the House of Lords4.8 House of Lords procedure is, broadly, similar to that in the House ofCommons. When a Bill is brought from the Commons or introduced into the lords, the First Reading is moved forthwith and the Bill goes through the samestages as in the Commons. The main differences are that any amendment tabledmay be moved and there is no selection of amendments. There are no standing committees and Bills are normally debated in Committee of the whole House,but sometimes suitable Bills are sent to a Public Bill Committee. There maybe a Report Stage even where no amendments have been made in Committee,and amendments may be moved then and on Third Reading. Although allBills have to be passed by both Houses, in effect financial legislation is notscrutinised in detail by the House of Lords. The Lord Chancellor is availableto advise the House on English legal points arising in the course of theconsideration of Bills, but normally no Scottish Law Officer is a Member of theHouse. In 1969, during the Labour Administration of 1964-70, this difficulty was obviated when the then Lord Advocate was created a Life Peer and wasthen available to advise the House on Scottish legal matters during the remainder of that Administration^ term.Amendments made by second House4.9 The procedure in either House for the consideration of amendments madeto one of its Bills by the other House is essentially the same. If the first Houseagrees to all the amendments a message is sent to the other House to that effect.If not, a message is sent which may contain either reasons for disagreement oramendments to the amendments made by the second House and consequentialamendments to the Bill. The second House may agree with the first House,or disagree and insist on their own amendments, and may in either event make further amendments; a message is sent to the first House accordingly. A singleexchange of messages is in practice usually sufficient to secure agreement, butif agreement is not reached before the end of the Session the Bill is lost, unlessthe Parliament Act is invoked in the next Session.Royal Assent4.10 When a Bill has been finally passed by both Houses, Royal Assent is normally notified separately to each House in accordance with the provisionsof the Royal Assent Act 1967, though Royal Assent may on occasion still bepronounced by Commission in the presence of both Houses. It is still possiblefor Royal Assent to be declared by the Sovereign in person in Parliament.The last occasion was in 1854.PRIVATE MEMBERS&apos; BILLSProcedure in the Commons4.11 A Private Member&apos;s Bill is a public Bill promoted by a back-bench orOpposition Member, or brought from the Lords after being promoted by aprivate Peer. Its progress depends largely on the extent to which it receives
some of the restricted amount of time allowed for Private Members&apos; business.In recent Sessions 12 Fridays have been allotted to Private Members&apos; Bills inthe House of Commons. Priority in debate on these Fridays is determined bya ballot (for Commons Bills) held soon after the beginning of each Session.In addition as soon as the ballot Bills have been presented (and given a formalFirst Reading) and a date has been named for their Second Reading, Membersmay seek leave to introduce Bills on Tuesdays and Wednesdays by a motionunder the &quot;10-minute rule&quot; procedure which allows one speech of approximately10 minutes&apos; duration for the proposal and one such speech against it. If the motion is carried the Bill is given a formal First Reading. After the ballot Billshave been presented, Members may also introduce Bills on any day by a simplewritten notice of presentation. On presentation such Bills are likewise given a formal First Reading. A Private Member&apos;s Bill is in practice unlikely to make progress in the Commons if it is opposed by the Government. Subject to that,it follows the stages described above for Government Bills.Procedure in the Lords4.12 In the House of Lords it is the privilege of any Peer to present a Billwithout notice and without moving for leave to bring it in, and it is mostunusual for any objections to be raised at that stage. Though the government can oppose the Bill in debate, it is for the House to decide what progress theBill shall make; this is equally true of a Private Member&apos;s Bill brought fromthe Commons. The Lords will always take up a Private Member&apos;s Bill that has passed the Commons, but may alter it substantially, or, on occasion, reject it.THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON CONSOLIDATION BILLS4.13 There are three categories of public consolidation Bills that are referredto the Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills. They are: (1) pure consolidation;(2) consolidation with corrections and minor improvements under the consolidation of Enactments (Procedure) Act 1949; and (3) consolidation with amendments to give effect to recommendations of the Law Commissions. (Inthis and the following paragraphs of this chapter, &quot;Law Commissions&quot; means the Law Commission, the Scottish Law Commission, or both of them). Theyare invariably introduced in the House of Lords, and are referred to the JointCommittee after Second Reading.4.14 In the case of a pure consolidation Bill, the Joint Committee makeany amendments necessary to bring the Bill into conformity with the existing law or to improve its form, and report to that effect.4.15 In the case of a Bill presented under the 1949 Act, the Joint committee may have to consider representations before considering the Bill and itsaccompanying memorandum and deciding what, if any, corrections and minor improvements they are prepared to approve. Provided the Lord chancellor and the Speaker concur in the Committee&apos;s approval, the Bill is reported asconsolidating the existing law with those corrections and improvements, whichare then deemed for the purpose of the Bill&apos;s remaining stages to be part of theexisting law.4.16 The Law Commissions may in connection with any consolidation Billsubmit a report recommending amendments of the existing law, designed to
facilitate its satisfactory consolidation, that would not necessarily fall withinthe 1949 Act definition of &quot;corrections and minor improvements&quot;. The Bill as presented is drafted so as to give effect to the recommendations, and the JointCommittee may approve or disapprove the recommendations or alter themanner in which the recommendations have been implemented in the Bill,reporting to that effect and that in their opinion the Bill, apart from the recom-mendations, is pure consolidation and represents the existing law.4.17 Bills in all three categories are then committed to a Committee of thewhole House and go through the remaining stages in both Houses described above under &quot;GOVERNMENT BILLS&quot;. After consideration by the JointCommittee, a pure consolidation Bill may not be amended so as to alter theexisting law that it consolidates. In the case of a Bill presented under the 1949Act, the corrections and improvements approved by the Joint Committee sharethis immunity from amendment. In the case of a Consolidation Bill with law commission amendments, those parts of it that are not pure consolidation,that is to say the parts that reflect the Commissions&apos; recommendations, areamendable.4.18 Where a Bill re-enacts existing statutes with amendments other thanthose described in paragraphs 4.15 and 4.16, it is not referred to the JointCommittee and any amendments may be moved to the statutes that are to beconsolidated.4.19 Three further categories of Bills are referred to the Joint Committee.These include Statute Law Revision Bills, which are confined to the repeal ofenactments that are &quot;obsolete, spent, unnecessary or superseded&quot;; and statute law (Repeals) Bills, prepared by the Law Commissions with the object ofrepealing enactments that in their opinion are &quot;no longer of practical utility&quot;.The phrase &quot;no longer of practical utility&quot; has been generously interpreted,and the scope of the repeals which have been effected by Statute Law (Repeals)Bills is much wider than the scope of those effected by a traditional Statute law revision Bill, so that Statute Law (Repeals) Bills have made an important contribution to the tidying up of the statute book. Bills in both these categoriesmay be amended in either House after being reported by the Joint Committee.The third category comprises Bills to re-enact for Scotland only the provisionsof Acts which extend to Scotland as part of the United Kingdom or GreatBritain and thus eliminate the need, in the original Act, to &quot;conflate&quot; theadaptations required for its application to Scotland. We refer to this procedureagain in paragraph 18.5 of Chapter XVIII.
Chapter VPUBLICATION OF STATUTESTHE STATUTE LAW COMMITTEE5.1 The Statute Law Committee, which is appointed by the Lord Chancellor,was established by Lord Chancelloi Cairns in 1868 &quot;to make the necessary arrangements and to superintend the work of preparing an edition of StatutesRevised&quot;. Originally the Committee consisted of about half a dozen officials,but by 1945 it had gradually increased in size to about a dozen members, whoincluded two Members of Parliament, as well as the First parliamentary counsel and the Parliamentary Draftsman for Scotland.5.2 Just after the war the membership was doubled, the Attorney-General,the Lord Advocate, and a number of Law Lords and legal members of bothHouses being added, together with three or four of the Permanent secretaries of Departments most concerned with the preparation of legislation, Counselto Mr Speaker and the Counsel to the Chairman of Committees, and, a littlelater, the Treasury Solicitor. The Committee was given the following new termsof reference:&quot;To consider the steps necessary to bring the Statute Book up to date by consolidation, revision and otherwise, and to superintend the publication and indexing of Statutes, Revised Statutes and Statutory Instruments&quot;.A new edition of Statutes Revised was started, and published in 1950, andconsolidation and Statute Law Revision were speeded up.5.3 Following the setting up of the Law Commissions in 1965 it was concluded that while their statutory functions covered many (but not all) of the responsibility-facilities previously undertaken by the Committee in the field of consolidation andstatute law revision, there were important duties which remained and should remain for the Committee to perform, including the supervision of the work ofthe Statutory Publications Office, the general supervision of the form of acts of Parliament, and the production of editions of Statutes Revised. The Chairmanof the Law Commission (for England and Wales) became Vice-Chairman ofthe Statute Law Committee, and the Chairman of the Scottish Law Commissionbecame a member. Liaison between the Committee and the Law Commissionsis maintained by this means, and by a discussion, initiated annually in theCommittee by the Chairmen of the two Commissions, on the plans and progressof the two Law Commissions in the field of consolidation. The Committeeis also kept informed of the progress made by the Commissions in the excisionof unwanted matter from the statute book.5.4 The Statute Law Committee, of which the Lord Chancellor is Chairman,meets once a year, normally about the beginning of December. Sub-committees have been appointed to investigate and make recommendations on a number of subjects connected with statute law. The new edition Statutes in Force (see below) was authorised by the Statute Law Committee following a proposal by
a sub-committee, as was the recent edition of the pre-Union Scottish Acts,and the numbering of Acts by calendar instead of regnal year. The preparation and publication of Statutes in Force is under the control of an Editorial Boardset up by the Statute Law Committee.THE STATUTORY PUBLICATIONS office.5 Despite its name, this Office does not publish anything. It is a compilingand editing organisation: the publishing is done by Her Majesty&apos;s stationery office. The Statutory Publications Office comprises an Editor and three AssistantEditors, all with English legal qualifications, and supporting staff. The work ofthe Office is carried out under the general supervision of the Statute LawCommittee, and work on Statutes in Force is under the control of an EditorialBoard set up by that Committee. The work of the Office is carried out under thegeneral supervision of the Statute Law Committee. The work consists mainly of:(a) preparing Statutes in Force under the general direction of the EditorialBoard;(b) preparing the Index and Table of Effects published with the annualvolumes of Public General Acts and Measures;(c) preparing Annotations to Acts (see below);(d) preparing the annual Index to the Statutes and the annual Chrono-logical Table of the Statutes;(e) work connected with Statutory Instruments, including their registra-tion and the preparation of annual volumes for the press.ORIGINAL TEXTS5.6 The original texts of all classes of Acts passed by the WestminsterParliaments after 1497, both printed and unprinted, may be inspected in the record Office of the House of Lords, which can also supply typed or photo-graphic copies of the Acts. Those texts are by tradition the authorised &quot;mastercopies&quot;. Texts of most of the earlier statutes are to be seen in the Public RecordOffice and elsewhere. Original records of Scottish Acts from 1466 to 1707are held by the Keeper of the Records of Scotland at HM General RegisterHouse, Edinburgh.OFFICIAL PUBLICATIONSSingle copies of Acts5.7 Single copies of all Acts (including local and personal Acts) after 1804can be obtained from Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office. Copies of Acts printedas originally enacted, and of Acts printed as amended pursuant to a &quot;printingclause&quot;,1 are known as Queen&apos;s Printer&apos;s copies. Single copies of Acts aspublished in Statutes in Force can also be obtained from HMSO, as can Queen&apos;sPrinters copies of Acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.1A &quot;printing clause&quot; is a statutory provision for the reprinting of an Act with amendmentsor additions carried into place and repealed matter omitted. &quot;Printing clauses&quot; have beenrare: those still in force occur in the Administration of Justice Act 1928 (section 20(5)), theHouse of Commons Disqualification Act 1957 (section 5(2), as extended by the ministers of the Crown Act 1964 (section 5(2)), and the Land Compensation (Scotland) Act 1973(section 81(2)). In all these instances the terms of the provision require the text of the reprintto be prepared and certified by the Clerk of the Parliaments.
Annual volumes5.8 The texts of public Acts of the Parliaments of England and Great Britainfrom 1235 up to the end of the reign of Queen Anne (1713) are to be found inthe edition known as Statutes of the Realm. All but the earliest of these textsare also to be found in the Sessional Volumes of Statutes going back to theyear 1483, printed until 1793 in Gothic &quot;black letter&quot; type. These editions do not contain the texts of the pre-Union Scottish Acts, which may be found in the record Edition of the Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland. From 1940 onwardsthe volumes have been annual instead of sessional and they are now calledPublic General Acts and Measures. Each contains an index and (since 1857)a table showing the effect that the Acts in the volume have on those of earlier years. Since 1926 the volumes have also included the Measures of the general assembly (now the General Synod) of the Church of England. There arecorresponding bound volumes of Public General Acts, Northern Irelandfrom 1921.Collected editionsStatutes Revised5.9 The first edition of Statutes Revised, in eighteen volumes, comprising thepublic Acts in force at the end of 1878, as amended, was completed in 1885.The second edition, in twenty-four volumes published by instalments between1888 and 1929, brought the work of revision down to the year 1920. The thirdedition, comprising thirty-two bound volumes of statutes (and one volumeof Church Assembly Measures for the years 1920 to 1948) was published in1950 and contains in chronological order all public general enactments from1235 onwards (other than certain enactments relating exclusively to NorthernIreland and the pre-Union Scottish Acts), as they were in force at the end ofthe year 1948.5.10 The pre-Union Scottish Acts in force on 1 August 1964 are availablein a small volume entitled The Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland 1424-1707.An earlier edition had been published in 1908. n5.11 Statutes Revised, Northern Ireland, contains the relevant statutory lawfrom 1226 to 1950 (including amendments made up to the end of 1954) andcomprises Acts or portions of Acts of the Westminster, and earlier, Parliamentsthat extend to Northern Ireland, and the Acts of the Northern Ireland Parliamentup to 1950.Statutes in Force5.12 An official revised edition of the extant public general Acts is currently being published in a new form, consisting of a series of booklets, one for eachAct, contained in binders which permit the booklets to be replaced. The Actsare printed so as to incorporate textual amendments and repeals, and arearranged in groups and sub-groups according to their subject-matter. Withingroups and sub-groups, Acts are arranged in chronological order. The editionis called Statutes in Force and is being published in instalments. The first ofthese, comprising Acts relating to Agriculture and to Compulsory Acquisition,appeared in 1972, together with a Guide to the whole Edition. The secondinstalment, published in 1974, comprises Acts relating to property in England
and Wales and Acts relating to land tenure, conveyancing, trusts and liferentsin Scotland. The third instalment, to be published in spring 1975, comprisesActs relating to income, corporation and capital gains taxes and the sale ofgoods. The edition is kept up to date by issuing new Acts within the scope ofgroups already published, new editions of Acts (within those groups) that havebeen extensively amended, and an annual cumulative supplement containing,in separate parts, one for each published group, particulars of new legislationaffecting Acts in the group.5.13 Statutes in Force includes pre-Union Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland,but does not generally include Acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland, or with a few exceptions Westminster enactments relating exclusively to northern Ireland that were passed before 3 May 1921 or deal with reserved landpurchase matters.5.14 The edition is being printed by computer-assisted typesetting. we discuss in Chapter XVI the resulting possibility of using the &quot;computer-readable&quot; magnetic tapes produced for this purpose for retrieving information from the text, thus enabling draftsmen and others rapidly to search all currentpublic general statute law through the computer.Annotations5.15 Statutes Revised, Third Edition, and the Public General Acts and Measuressince 1948, can be brought or kept up to date by means of Annotations to Acts,an annual publication containing instructions for striking out repealed matterand noting textual and other amendments. We are told that it is estimated thatthe annotation, from scratch, of a complete set of volumes would take atrained clerk nearly a year to complete, and that the Parliamentary CounselOffice are therefore having instead to use Halsbury&apos;s Statutes see paragraph 5.27 for the extra sets of statutes they need. The annual cumulative supplements toStatutes in Force provide an updating service for users of that publication.Indexes and tablesIndex to the Statutes5.16 This is an annual publication in which all the public general statute law(including pre-Union Scottish Acts from 1424) in force at the end of the previous year is collected under some 1,000 main subject headings, with over 20,000cross-references.5.17 A corresponding work for the statute law affecting Northern Ireland,called Index to the Statutes in Force affecting Northern Ireland, is publishedtriennially.Chronological Table of the Statutes5.18 This is a cumulative annual publication that lists, in chronologicalorder, all the public general Acts since 1235 (including pre-Union ScottishActs from 1424, and Measures of the Church of England Assembly and theGeneral Synod since 1920). The Table shows whether an Act is still in force and,if it is, gives details of all partial repeals, amendments, applications and similarmatters that affect it.
5.19 There is a corresponding work called the Chronological Table of the statutes affecting Northern Ireland, published triennially.Annual Volumes5.20 The annual volumes of Public General Acts and Measures contain, eachyear, in addition to the Acts and Measures themselves, an alphabetical Indexto the short titles and contents of the year&apos;s public general Acts and Measures,Tables containing alphabetical and chronological lists of short titles (including an alphabetical list of Local and Personal Acts), Tables of Derivations of theyear&apos;s consolidation Acts,1 and a Table showing the effect that the year&apos;slegislation has on that of previous years. The Index and Tables are also publishedeach year in a separate booklet.Statutes in Force5.21 Each subject group has its own index, except for a few large groups,each sub-group of which may have its own index. When the work is complete,there will be an index to the work as a whole. There are also general alphabeticaland chronological lists of the Acts so far published in the work. Revised indexesand general lists of Acts are to be issued as required.Statutory Instruments5.22 Statutory Instruments sometimes amend statutes, and are used in many instances to appoint dates for.their commencement. Both commencementorders and instruments that amend statutes are noted in the Tables of effect at the end of the annual volumes of Public General Acts and Measures and inAnnotations to Acts.5.23 It may, therefore, sometimes be necessary, in order to ascertain thestatute law in force at a particular date, to refer to Statutory Instruments.These have appeared in a series of indexed annual volumes since 1890, and thereis an official collected edition of instruments in force at the end of 1948. a subject index the Index to Government Orders , including a table of statutory powers to make instruments, is published in alternate years, and there is acumulative annual table showing amendments and revocations. Annual,monthly, and daily lists of Statutory Instruments are also published. Eachsubject group of Statutes in Force has a companion list of the general statutory instruments made under the Acts in the group.Local and Personal Acts5.24 These do not fall within our terms of reference, though it is to be notedthat they may, as respects the locality or body concerned, amend or otherwiseaffect the provisions of public general Acts. There is an official index for theperiod 1801-1947, a supplementary index for 1948-1966, and, from 1948onwards, an annual booklet containing an index and tables. The Law Commis-sions have now started work on the compilation of a chronological table of allthe Private Acts passed since 1539.1 Starting with the 1974 volumes, Tables of Destinations are also included.23
DEPARTMENTAL COMPILATIONS5.25 Certain Government departments make available to the public collectededitions of statute law administered by the department. One of these editions isThe Taxes Acts, compiled by the Inland Revenue and published by Her Majesty&apos;stationery Office. This contains Acts and Statutory Instruments relating toincome tax, corporation tax, and capital gains tax, or affecting the applicationof those taxes. A new edition, in several paperback volumes,1 is published eachyear. Each edition is cumulative and replaces the previous year&apos;s edition,repealed matter and amendments being indicated typographically and byfootnotes. Earlier versions of particular passages are often given. The work isindexed and includes cross-references between consolidating and consolidatedenactments, as well as tables of rates of taxes and allowances.5.26 The Department of Health and Social Security has produced three,separate compilations (all published by the Stationery Office). These are TheLaw Relating to Family Allowances and National Insurance, The Law Relatingto Supplementary Benefit and Family Income Supplements, and The national insurance (Industrial Injuries) Acts and Regulations. Each contains the relevantActs and Statutory Instruments and is in a loose-leaf format, kept up to date by the issue, as required, of supplements comprising new and replacement sheetsfor insertion in the binders.COMMERCIAL PUBLICATIONS5.27 General collections of annotated statutes include Halsbury&apos;s Statutes(a bound revised edition arranged by subjects, with an annual supplement)and Current Law Statutes (annual bound volumes from 1947 onwards, publishedalso periodically through the year, with a cumulative annual &quot;Citator&quot; showingthe effect of repeals and amendments). ButterwortKs Annotated LegislationService comprises selected legislation considered to be of general interest to thelegal profession; Acts published in the series that have been wholly repealedare noted in a biennial index.5.28 Collections of annotated statutes on particular subjects include Lumley&apos;public Health (legislation concerning local government generally, arrangedchronologically and published in bound volumes with an annual continuationvolume and cumulative supplement), and a number of loose-leaf collectionseach updated about three times yearly. These include Simorfs Taxes (enactments relating to income tax, corporation tax, and capital gains tax), De Voil onValue Added Tax, Mahaffy and Dodson on Road Traffic, Shawcross andBeaumont on Air Law, and Harvey on Industrial Relations; the British TaxEncyclopaedia, the Encyclopaedia of Value Added Tax, the Encyclopaedia ofLabour Relations Law, and the Encyclopaedia of European Community Law;and the Local Government Library comprising Encyclopaedias of compulsory purchase and Compensation, Factories Shops and Offices Law and Practice,Highway Law and Practice, Housing Law and Practice, Public Health Law and practice, Road Traffic Law and Practice, and The Law of Town and country planning. All the collections mentioned in this paragraph also contain relevantStatutory Instruments and departmental Circulars.1 The 1974 edition is in four volumes.
5.29 It should be noted, however, that whilst Current Law Statutes includesScotland-only legislation Halsbury&apos;s Statutes (with minor exceptions) does not;neither do the collections mentioned in paragraph 5.28, except the Encyclopaediaof Factories Shops and Offices Law and Practice and the Encyclopaedia of road traffic Law and Practice.5.30 Both branches of the legal profession, chartered accountants, lawyers in central and local government, and others involved in the practical applicationof statute law, rely heavily on the commercial publications, for (in the absenceof a computerised information retrieval system) they provide the quickest meansof finding relevant statutory provisions and the cases in which they have beeninterpreted by the courts.EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES5.31 The main treaties governing the three European Communities have been published as Command papers. Other treaties relating to the Communities havebeen published by HMSO in the ten volumes of European Communities, treaties and Related Instruments (1972). The basic treaties, brought up to date as at January 1973, are also available in English in a single volume published by the communities in 1973 (Treaties establishing the European Communities; treatiesamending these treaties; documents concerning the Accession).5.32 Community secondary legislation is published in the &quot;L&quot; (Legislation)series of the Official Journal of the European Communities, which usually appearsdaily. Although only regulations are required to be so published,1 other instruments the publication of which is not obligatory are in practice included.The &quot;C&quot; (Communications) series of the Official Journal contains draft instru-ments, notices, and various other items of information. It usually appearsabout three times a week. A monthly supplement covering both series containswhat is called a &quot;methodological table&quot;, in which instruments in the &quot;L&quot;series are listed in numerical order under the headings &quot;Acts whose publicationis obligatory&quot; and &quot;Acts whose publication is not obligatory&quot; and the moreephemeral ones are distinguished typographically. Single copies of the OfficialJournal are sold by HMSO, and subscriptions are arranged by the Office for official Publications of the European Communities in Luxembourg.5.33 Community secondary legislation in force on 31 December 1972 is tobe found in Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, Subject Edition(HMSO, 1973; 42 volumes). Secondary legislation published in the OfficialJournal during 1973 is indexed in Secondary Legislation of the european communities, Subject List and Table of Effects 1973 (HMSO), in which instru-ments are listed by subject under the volume titles used in the Subject Edition(see above); the Table of Effects lists instruments amended or repealed byinstruments published in 1973. The Subject List and Table of Effects for community instruments published since 1973 follows the same scheme, butpublication has been by monthly parts, which will cumulate into a singlevolume at the end of each year.5.34 Commercial publishers are also active in this field. In the loose-leafEncyclopaedia of European Community Law (see paragraph 5.28), Vol. A,published in 1973, contains the European Communities Act 1972 and other1 e.c. Treaty, Article 191; EURATOM Treaty, Article 163.
United Kingdom sources; Vol. B (1973) contains the main treaties; and Vol. C,part of which will be published this year, will contain secondary legislation(excluding regulations on agriculture and customs duties). Halsburfs Statutes(see paragraph 5.27) is to be expanded by the publication of European Continua-tion Volumes, the first of which will appear shortly and will contain the texts of the three main treaties and the amending treaties, and the more importantsecondary legislation from 1952 to 1972. Summaries of some less importantinstruments will be included, but not of instruments of a purely ephemeralnature. The material will be arranged under the existing Halsburfs subjecttitles. There are to be annual supplements containing lists of all instruments,additional texts, and a noter-up. Further continuation volumes, containingtexts and summaries as in the initial volume, will be published for groups of years. The work will be cross-referenced to the main body of Ha/sbury&apos;sStatutes. It will also be published as a separate work, under the title EuropeanLegislation.
Chapter vi the CRITICISMINTRODUCTORY ,6.1 Our terms of reference imply a widespread concern that much of ourstatute law lacks simplicity and clarity. This concern has been expressed to usin evidence by the judiciary; by bodies representing the legal and other profes-sions, by the Statute Law Society1, by non-professional bodies and by prominentlaymen familiar with the problems of preparing legislation. First, let us try to assess the strength and substance of the criticism.6.2  The complaints we have heard may be broadly grouped as follows:(a) Language. It is said that the language used is obscure and complex,its meaning elusive and its effect uncertain.(b) Over-elaboration. It is said that the desire for &quot;certainty&quot; in theapplication of legislation leads to over-elaboration.(c) Structure. The internal structure of, and sequence of clauses within,individual statutes is considered to be often illogical and unhelpfulto the reader.(d) Arrangement and amendment. The chronological arrangement of the statutes and the lack of clear connection between various Acts bearing on related subjects are said to cause confusion and make it difficultto ascertain the current state of the lav/ on any given matter. Thisconfusion is increased by the practice of amending an existing Act,not by altering its text (and reprinting it as a new Act) but by passinga new Act which the reader has to apply to the existing Act and workout the meaning for himself.In the following paragraphs we set out some of the criticism we have received under each of these heads.LANGUAGE6.3   The Statute Law Society criticise the language of the statutes as:&quot;legalistic, often obscure and circumlocutious, requiring a certain typeof expertise in order to gauge its meaning. Sentences are long and involved,the grammar is obscure, and archaisms, legally meaningless words andphrases, tortuous language, the preference for the double negative over the single positive, abound&quot;.The representatives of the Society who gave oral evidence were unable tosupport this general condemnation; but we are impressed by other evidencethat the legislative output of Parliament is often incomprehensible even to thosewho are most familiar with the subject matter of the legislation, as the following1 An unofficial body of statute users whose aim is to press for improvements in the draftingand publication of statute laws.
quotation illustrates. Referring to section 121 and Schedule 26 of the finance act 1972, an expert on tax law has recently written an article which includes the following passage:&quot;But even if tidied up, Schedule 26 will still be incomprehensible on first reading and probably on many readings to anyone who is notthoroughly familiar with estate duty law and practice. The writer, who has worked closely with estate duty statutes for over forty years, has had to devote hours of time to the production of this article, and even now is not sure he has got it right. The ordinary solicitor, to whom estate duty isonly one of numerous bodies of law with which he has to deal, must find it extremely difficult to comprehend section 121 and Schedule 26 by simplyreading their texts, given the limited time he has available&quot;.1Parliamentary drafting which requires such a high degree of intellectual penetration-tion to construe has been described to us as an &quot;arcane art&quot; by one of our witnesses, Lord Molson; and has called forth the following observation from another of our witnesses, the Chief National Insurance Commissioner,Sir Robert Micklethwait QC:&quot;A statute should not only be clear and unambiguous, but readable.It ought not to call for the exercise of a cross-word/acrostic mentality whichis able to ferret out the meaning from a number of sections, schedules and regulations&quot;.One example of what the Chief National Insurance Commissioner may havehad in mind is the type of enactment which operates by way of hypothesis.This is often the best and sometimes the only method of drafting the enactmentcorrectly, but it puts considerable strain on the general reader, especially if heis left to find his own way to (and through) the specific provisions which govern the hypothetical situation, and not less so if one hypothesis is piled on anotheras in the footnote to Part II of Schedule 1 of the National Insurance Act 1946to which we were referred by Lord Simon of Glaisdale:&quot;For the purpose of this Part of the Schedule a person over pensionable age, not being an insured person, shall be treated as an employed personif he would be an insured person were he under pensionable age and wouldbe an employed person were he an insured person&quot;.It is of course unfair to parade an enactment such as this out of its contextand ask the general reader to guess what it means. The footnote did its workeconomically and accurately, and it may be presumed at least that parliament has been satisfied with it, having re-enacted it without alteration over and overagain. But it is fair comment that any enactment of this type is liable to beprovocative, and the more so the more skilfully it is compressed.6.4 The complexity and obscurity of much statute law has given rise tonumerous pleas in evidence we have received that Acts should be written inplainer language. For example, the Master of the Rolls, Lord Denning, said:&quot;If you were seeking to see what different principles should be applied;the first would be to recommend simpler language and shorter sentences-The sentence which goes into ten lines is unnecessary. It could be split up into shorter ones anyway, and couched in simpler language. Simplicity andclarity of language are essential&quot;.1 Professor G S A Wheatcroft, Estate Duty Relief for Spouses and Charities [1973] BritishTax Review p 207, at p 242.
Lord Denning&apos;s views were echoed by most of the judges who talked to usabout the drafting of statutes, and it is not difficult to find in the law reportscases in which interpretation problems caused by obscurity or complexity oflanguage have arisen. In Appendix B we list some examples of cases whichhave caused the courts problems on this score. Several private individualshave also sent us memoranda which suggest that the language in which the statutes are drafted is an impediment to a better understanding of the law bylay people; and we have had evidence from such non-legal bodies as the Councilof the National Citizens&apos; Advice Bureaux and the Trades Union Congresswhich bear out this conclusion.OVER-ELABORATION6.5 Another source of difficulty frequently mentioned is the tendency on thepart of Parliament to try to provide for every foreseeable contingency. Becauseof this tendency statutes are drafted in elaborate detail which makes themdifficult to understand. This has called forth criticism from a number of sources.The Lord President of the Court of Session, Lord Emslie, and the Lord JusticeClerk, Lord Wheatley, for example, put this criticism in the following way:&quot;Most of the problems encountered by the Courts flow directly fromthe tendency of Parliament to ignoie the virtue of enacting broad general rules in which the principal and over-riding intention can be readily seen,and to try to legislate in detail for particular aspects of the mischief whichpresumably the statute is intended to curb. It is an eternal truth that one can seldom foresee every combination of circumstances which may arise,and the practical consequence of attempting to do so and of drafting a statute so as to concentrate unduly on foreseen examples is more oftenthan not to conceal the general intention and the ambit of that intentionin a welter of detached provisions which leave one in doubt as to whethera particular combination of circumstances not expressly provided for was intended to be covered at all. It is probably the case that legislation indetail is resorted to because Parliamentarians harbour the suspicion thatjudges cannot be trusted to give proper effect to clear statements ofprinciple. This, with respect to them (the Parliamentarians), is whollyunfounded. Indeed, so far as Scots judges are concerned, the strength oftheir common law system lies in its reliance upon broad statements ofprinciple, and there is no reason to suppose that similar broad statements of principle in statute law would not, in their hands, be applied to thefacts of any given case, to achieve the will of Parliament&quot;.These comments are the result of endeavours on the part of the legislature toensure against the possibility that the legislation will be construed by someone,in some remote circumstances, so as to have a different effect from that envisaged by those preparing the Bill in question. As one Parliamentarydraftsman has put it: &quot;The object is to secure that in the ultimate resort the judge is driven to adopt the meaning which the draftsman wants him to adopt.If in so doing he can use plain language, so much the better. But this is ofteneasier said than done&quot;.6.6 The criticism that Acts of Parliament are couched in excessive detaildoes not come from the judiciary alone. As an example of the same criticism
from other sources we quote the words of the National Farmers&apos; Union inrelation to the restrictive trade practices legislation. They say that this legislation&quot;attempts to set out in great detail the rules governing the question of 1whether or not an arrangement is registrable and the issue of whether ornot any arrangement is against the public interest, to mention two examples.It is a common feature of anti-avoidance legislation to deal with matters in such detail, but it is questionable whether the statutory provisions onrestrictive trade practices should be looked upon as coming within this class of legislation. It is concerned with such variable factors as the publicinterest, the national economy, and fair trading activities. These can vary from time to time and from place to place and they depend, amongst other things, on the subject matter of the arrangement in question and thesizes of the businesses involved. Such matters cannot adequately be covered in detail by statute. There is a need for more flexibility; more scope for adminsitrative discretion&quot;.6.7 The practice of legislating in too much detail is a main cause of com-complexity and of some of the obscurity in our statute law. There are three ways of lawmaking in detail:(a) to set out detailed provisions in sections in the body of the statute;(b) to set them out in schedules, having stated the principles in the sections: as to this see Chapter X;(c) to leave it to the Government to make detailed provisions by statutory instruments.Whichever of these three courses is adopted, Parliament cannot apply the law to individual cases in which there may be doubt. That is the function of thecourts, and when they are interpreting statutes in cases which come before them,they have to exercise powers and responsibilities in questions of detail, howeverParliament may decide to make its intentions plain on such matters.6.8 If the first of those three methods can be avoided, the body of the statutebecomes more readable. If the third method is used, then despite the require-ments of the Statutory Instruments procedure, the control of Parliament over thedetails of legislation is to some extent diminished. Moreover, there is no advant-age to the user since he still has to acquaint himself with the detailed provisionsof the Statutory Instrument, and may have the additional difficulty of finding it.STRUCTURE OF ACTS AND SEQUENCE OF CLAUSES6.9 Each Act has, or should have, an inherent logic, and its provisions shouldbe arranged in an orderly manner according to that underlying logic. But thisideal, it is said, is not always realised. From a logical point of view, the main purpose of a Bill should be made clear early on. This statement of intent,whether it takes the form of the enunciation of general principles or otherwise,is desirable both for the legislators to help them to understand what they arebeing asked to pass into law, and for the courts to help them to understand the intention of Parliament when they are interpreting the legislation. statements of intent would also assist those who must obey and advise on the legislation.The intention is now, however, rarely spelt out in the statute itself, although in continental and e.c. legislation this is often done in the form of a preambleor in other ways; and we consider this later in Chapters IX, XI and XIX.
6.10 Many of the witnesses have said that more attention should be paid tothe logical sequence of the provisions of statutes, and that there should be a consistent approach to such questions as what kind of provision should go inthe main body of the Act and what in the Schedules, so that people could more easily find their way about them. There is also the criticism that sentences aresometimes too long, and complicated by too many subordinate phrases, andthat there should be greater readiness to break up clauses into separate sub-sections. We are impressed by the unanimity of opinion that the structure ofour statutes is capable of improvement and we deal with this further in chapter XI.6.11 Another criticism relates to the geographical extent of statutes or of individual sections of statutes. Sometimes this is not expressed in words but is left to be inferred, as a matter of construction, from the context or by referenceto external sources. For example, a provision carrying in itself no indication of its extent may in fact extend only to England and Wales because it consists of an amendment to an existing Act which extends only to England and Wales.It has been represented to us that this is one of the factors which make forobscurity, and that all provisions of this kind should carry express wordsindicating their extent specifically. It has also been suggested that extent clausesgoverning Acts as a whole, or Parts of Acts would be more easily found if theywere placed at the beginning of the Acts or Parts in question, rather than (as atpresent) near the end of the main text but before any Schedules, and that thisshould be the normal place for them. We discuss these questions further in chapter XVIII.6.12 Nearly all statutes have &quot;interpretation clauses&quot; in which appeardefinitions of words and phrases used in those statutes. The present practice isgenerally to insert such clauses at the end, but it has been suggested to us thatthese should also be placed earlier as is the general practice in drafting delegated legislation. This too is discussed in Chapter XVIII.ARRANGEMENT AND AMENDMENT6.13 The fourth main ground of complaint in the evidence we have receivedrelates to the collective grouping of the statutes and the manner in which theyare amended two matters which, as will appear, are closely related to one another. It is said that among the new statutes which are added to the statute book year by year there are many which are more or less intimately connectedwith existing statutes and that insufficient assistance is given to the reader inthe task of collation which results from the purely chronological arrangement.It becomes increasingly difficult to locate the relevant Acts on any given topic;and, more seriously, once the relevant Acts have been located they may well befound to be distributed among three or four separate volumes, so that readingthem together becomes physically as well as mentally a formidable task.6.14 Our attention has been directed by the National Farmers&apos; Union tothe various Acts dealing with trade practices as illustrating defects of arrange-ment in statute law. In particular, two common defects of arrangement can be illustrated by reference to these Acts:(1) The Fair Trading Act 1973 is an example of the lumping together ofdisparate subjects in a single statute. The National Farmers&apos; Union say:&quot;The connecting factor is that the administration of the lawon the various subjects concerned will be in the hands of one
official, who will deal with restrictive practices, with monopolies and mergers, and with certain aspects of consumer protection.These various subjects, however, would be much better dealt withby separate measures with one or more statutes dealing with each&quot;.(2) In section 44(2) of the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act1968 the expression &quot;co-operative association&quot; is defined by providing that it has the meaning assigned by subsection (9) of section 70 of theFinance Act 1965. The context of subsection (9) (now section 340(9)of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970) is wholly different from the context of section 44(2) of the Act of 1968. Thus, the readeris not only subjected to the inconvenience of having to look at twoActs instead of one, but he is also left with the problem of decidinghow the definition of &quot;co-operative association&quot; is to be construedwhen it is applied in a context different from that for which it was originally devised.6.15 But there is another problem. New laws frequently amend existingstatutes. Such amendment, however, by no means always takes the form of substituting a fresh and amended text in the statute which is being amended.The &quot;non-textual&quot; amendment of legislation has been criticised by many of our witnesses, though some of them conceded that its use may be unavoidable.Amendments drafted non-textually have been described as being:&quot;Drafted in a narrative or discursive style producing an inter-wovenweb of allusion, cross-reference and interpretation which effectivelyprevents the production of a collection of single Acts each relating to aparticular subject, otherwise than by the legislative processes of consolida-tion and repeal. Often Act is heaped upon Act until the result is chaoticand almost completely unintelligible. Indeed much of the confusionexisting in the Statute Book today is directly attributable to referentiallegislation&quot;.1The other method of amending previous legislation which several witnesseshave commended to us is the system of &quot;textual amendment&quot;. By using this method new statutes which alter the provisions of earlier Acts give effect tosuch alterations by enacting fresh portions of text which are then added to orsubstituted for the earlier version.6.16 Some judges have also been critical of the non-textual amendment system.Lord Denning had this to say on the matter:&quot;I would like to have the whole [Act] printed out with the complete newamendment written in. I do not like legislation by reference whereby youamend by saying that in such a previous Act you shall have some otherthing taken as so-and-so. I think that ought to be avoided as far as possible.It is a far more difficult task to interpret when you have legislation by reference. I do not like incorporation by reference at all. I would rathersay &apos;in place of such-and-such a section we shall have this&apos;. That is oftendone&quot;.1H H Marshall and N S Marsh, Case Law, Codification and Statute Law Revision (1965).32
Lord Emslie, expressing a strong preference for textual amendment to be usedwherever possible, said that this makes it&quot;so much easier to discover what the law is. Instead of having your fingersin about three different statutes at one and the same time, you get in anideal textual situation the final form of the live statute which you have todeal with, and when you want to discover the history of the final form youlook back to the earlier one. What I think from the point of view of theuser is invaluable, is to be able to look at the amended form of the section in a complete state instead of having to look here, there and everywhereat the same time&quot;.The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Widgery, told us that he wholeheartedly supportstextual amendment and that when complex legislation was amended textually,it was of enormous help to the judges.6.17 From the comments we have outlined in the foregoing paragraphs itappears that the users of the statutes are thus in the main critical of Acts whichamend existing legislation non-textually. They find these inconvenient andconfusing, and they complain that much time is wasted in the attempt to trackdown what the current law is on a subject on which there has been muchlegislation. These are serious complaints about the legislative products ofParliament. So far as the form and content of a Bill are concerned, the needs ofthe legislator are temporary, but the ultimate user may have to put up with an act that causes him permanent inconvenience and difficulty.6.18 Some of our witnesses consider that there should be a separate, easilyidentifiable, principal Act for each subject on which there is legislation andthat every time the law on any subject is changed the change ought to be effected by textual amendment of the principal Act for that subject. The up-to-datestatute law on each subject could thus be found easily in one place. This would however be difficult to achieve for a variety of reasons. First, there is no agree-ment about the way in which the multifarious topics on which there is legislation might be grouped together under main headings each of which would be thesubject of one of the suggested principal Acts. Such a lack of agreement is not surprising. Different requirements call for different groupings. The boundaries of jurisdiction of different courts of law, the limits of departmental respon-sibilities, the fields of interest of those who consult the statutes, the market-conscious concern of publishers all suggest particular schemes of grouping,but by no means all of them coincide.6.19 Secondly, a major programme of consolidation would need to bevigorously pursued before the current statute law could be arranged underprincipal headings. We have received evidence that there are practical difficultieswhich prevent much speedier consolidation. There is pressure on the draftsmen,on the Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills, and on the Governmentdepartments who play a major part in the preparation of consolidation Bills.We see these problems as presenting a serious obstacle to the achievement of amore intelligible statute book. It has been persuasively brought to our attentionthat greater progress in consolidation, and other vital improvements which werecommend, depend upon there being many more draftsmen.
ANGLO-SCOTTISH legislation.20 There is considerable criticism among Scottish practitioners of thedifficulties they have to face in construing legislation which attempts to combinein a single Act policy intended to have effect in Scotland as well as in Englandand Wales. We deal with this matter in Chapter XII.CONCLUSIONS ON THE CRITICISM6.21 In paragraphs 6.2 to 6.20 we have recited numerous criticisms whichhave been brought to our attention. In doing so, however, we in no way intend to reflect upon the skill and dedication of the Parliamentary draftsmen, whichwe greatly admire. They have to work under pressures and constraints which make it very difficult for them, with the best will in the world, to producesimple and clear legislation. They are inadequately staffed and are often givengigantic tasks to perform in a race against time. They are required to resolveconflicting attitudes which cannot always be reconciled. For example, a Billmay have to be made short enough and narrow enough in scope to get through parliament in the face of strenuous opposition, while at the same time containingas much detail as may be needed to enable the legislators to see what its effect will be in a wide variety of circumstances. Even in the face of such difficultiesmany statutes are well-drafted and give no grounds for criticism in respect ofclarity and simplicity; indeed some of our witnesses have praised the drafting of a number of recent Acts. Not all of the criticism we have heard in relationto particular Acts has turned out, on close examination, to be entirely valid.Nevertheless, after making all due allowance, there remains cause for concern that difficulty is being encountered by the ultimate users of the statutes, andthis difficulty increases as the statute book continues to grow, i
Chapter VIIFACTORS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN SUGGESTINGREMEDIES7.1 In subsequent chapters of this Report we examine various remedies todeal with such of the criticisms recounted in the previous chapter as we thinkare valid. Before solutions can be considered however, it is necessary to take account of several factors which have an inescapable effect on the situation.THE MASS OF LEGISLATION7.2 A prodigious mass of statute law is enacted each year by Parliament.Some idea of the current flow of new legislation can be obtained from thenumber of pages added to the statute book in the three decades from 1943 to1972. The figures are:These figures give some measure of the burden on Parliament and on theGovernment machine over the past thirty years. The accumulation of statute law is formidable, and figures worked out in 1965 showed that the &quot;live&quot;statute book consisted then of some 33,000 pages of current law, parts of itdating back 700 years.7.3 There is hardly any part of our national life or of our personal lives thatis not affected by one statute or another. The affairs of local authorities, nation-nationalised industries, public corporations and private commerce are regulated by legislation. The life of the ordinary citizen is affected by various provisions ofthe statute book from cradle to grave. His birth is registered, his infant welfareprotected, his education provided, his employment governed, his income and capital taxed, much of his conduct controlled and his old age sustained accordingto the terms of one statute or another. Many might think that as a nation wegroan under this overpowering burden of legislation and ardently desire tohave fewer rather than more laws. Yet the pressure for ever more legislation onbehalf of different interests increases as society becomes more complex and people more demanding of each other. With each change in society there comesa demand for further legislation to overcome the tensions which that changecreates, even though the change may itself have been caused by legislation,which thus becomes self-proliferating.7.4 Although matters of policy and the legislative programme are not within our terms of reference, we feel entitled to comment on the volume and scopeof the legislative output of Parliament, because these matters have a direct1943 to 1952 ...1953 to 1962 ...1963 to 1972 ...The total for 1973 is15,60011,00018,0002,248
influence on the form of Acts of Parliament. The more legislation there is andthe more such legislation tries to deal with complex situations, the more likelyit is that it will itself be complicated and therefore difficult to understand.It may be said that some degree of complexity and indeed obscurity may be theprice we have to pay if society feels it necessary to satisfy the demands for more and yet more statute law. For our part we would point out that the price is a high one and we would urge that it should not be paid too readily. It is of fundamental importance in a free society that the law should be readily ascertain-able and reasonably clear. To the extent that the law does not satisfy theseconditions, the citizen is deprived of one of his basic rights and the law itself is brought into contempt. Whatever may be the pressures to increase thevolume and extend the scope of legislation, it is our firm view that legislation which is complex and obscure may for that very reason be oppressive. Ourconstitution (unfortunately, as some people think) contains no entrenchedprovisions for the protection of the citizen against the dangers inherent in such legislation. A reduction in the volume and scope of the legislative output couldwell lead to an improvement in its simplicity and clarity. We think that thereare some measures which can be taken towards greater simplicity and clarity,even if the volume and scope of the legislative output remain undiminished.It is our object in this Report to consider what those measures are. We would only add that if the volume and scope of the legislative output continue toincrease, the prospect of improving the situation by these or any other measuresis far from encouraging.THE PROBLEM OF EXPRESSING COMPLICATED CONCEPTS INSIMPLE LANGUAGE7.5 Ideally statutes should be written in ordinary straightforward Englishthat can be readily understood by lawyers and laymen. However, although thereis a discernible trend towards a more colloquial style in current statutes (whichwe welcome), it is not possible to deal in simple non-technical terms withsubjects which are themselves technical and involved. Ordinary language reliesupon the good offices of the reader to fill in omissions and give the sense intendedto words or expressions capable of more than one meaning. It can afford to do this. In legal writing, on the other hand, not least in statutory writing, a primaryobjective is certainty of legal effect, and the United Kingdom legislature tends to prize this objective exceptionally highly. Statutes confer rights and imposeobligations on people. If any room is left for argument as to the meaning of anenactment which affects the liberty, the purse, or the comfort of individuals,that argument will be pursued by all available means. In this situation Parliamentseeks to leave as little as possible to inference, and to use words which are capable of one meaning only. When therefore it is necessary to express in language bound by these requirements concepts as complicated as those of, say,Schedule 26 of the Finance Act 1972 (referred to in paragraph 6.3 of theprevious chapter) it is not surprising that simplicity is hard to achieve. For these reasons statutory phrases often irritate or baffle the reader, either because they state the obvious or because the &quot;punch-line&quot; is delivered with such economythat it is intelligible only to those who have the time and inclination to informthemselves of the whole context on which it operates.
THE CONFLICTING NEEDS OF DIFFERENT AUDIENCESThe needs of the user7.6 The user of the statute book who turns to it for information about theway in which the law affects his or his clients&apos; interests should be able to findthis information without undue trouble. There will of course be certain Actswhich are not readily intelligible and it will usually be necessary for the laymanto seek the advice of a professional lawyer. It should be possible for a profes-sional adviser to find his way in the statute book without difficulty, and unnecessary obstacles ought not to be placed in his path. He has a right to expect that statutes should be drafted and arranged in a way which makesplain to him the relevance of the law, even of complex provisions, to theproblems of his clients. From the evidence we have received however it is clearthat the needs of such users of the statutes are not being met. We have paidparticular attention to the views of the eminent judges who have discussedthese matters with us because they, of all users, might be expected to give a balanced opinion as to how well or badly our legislation may be understood.We have discovered that even they often find it difficult to understand theintention of legislation passed by Parliament. If this is so, it is likely thatpractising lawyers find that the way in which the law is drafted presents at timesan impenetrable barrier to understanding it; and we have indeed had evidence to this effect. If lawyers find the law difficult, how can the layman expect tofare ? To the ordinary citizen the provisions in the statute book might sometimesas well be written in a foreign language for all the help he may expect to obtainthere as to his rights and duties under the law. And this in an age, as we have pointed out, when the statute law has a growing effect on practically everysphere of daily life.The needs of the government.7 We are precluded by our terms of reference from considering matters relating to the Governments legislative programme. We take this to mean thatwe are not prevented from describing generally how the management of this programme may affect the legislative output of Parliament.(a) Management of the legislative programme.8 The average length of a Parliamentary session in recent years has been about 160 working days. Just under half of this time has, on the floor of theHouse of Commons, been devoted to the consideration of Bills (includingPrivate Members&apos; Bills), the remainder being taken up by general debates,supply and Private Members&apos; non-legislative time. A substantial part of what is available for legislation is taken up by the Finance Bill; and when private members&apos; Bills are also taken into account, the time available to the Govern-ment for its own programme (excluding the Finance Bill) is reduced to about60 days. These 60 days allow for the discussion, mostly on second reading andreport stages, of about 50 Government Bills of all types, including consolidationBills. In practice therefore the amount of time at the disposal of the Governmentis commonly not enough to pass all the legislation for which a reasonable casecan be made. This situation has two effects which are inimical to the satisfactorydrafting of legislation from the user&apos;s point of view.
7.9 First, in the limited time available, it is of great importance to theGovernment that its Bills shall not be unduly held up by debate about theirprovisions. From the Governmenfs point of view, &quot;Bills are made to pass, asrazors are made to sell&quot; (to use Lord Thring&apos;s aphorism), and if there areconventions of drafting which are thought to limit discussion and increase the chances of getting Bills passed, they will be used, whatever the final result maybe like for the user. Sir John Fiennes, formerly First Parliamentary Counsel,put it to us thus:&quot;One of the jobs of the draftsmen is to present changes in the law toParliament in a debatable form. . . . You have to arrange a Bill, be it anew Bill or an amending Bill in a form in which it is capable of rationaldebate in the House all through its stages; if possible so that the maindebates occur at the right places, mopping up the subsidiary debates whichwill therefore not occur. If you have the subsidiary debates first they willprobably blow up into the main debates, and you will then have the maindebates again in their proper places afterwards&quot;.The draftsman must therefore carry out his work with one eye to the drafting of proposals that will commend themselves to the favour of a critical legislature,and the other to the eventual product as it will appear in the hands of the user.Sir Courtenay Ilbert commenting in 1901 on the choice before a Minister whenpresenting a Bill had this to say:&quot;The Minister in charge of a Bill will often insist, and wisely insist, ondeparture from logical arrangement with reference to the exigencies oflogical discussion. He will have considered how he intends to present his proposals to Parliament, and to defend them before the public, and will wish to have his Bill so arranged and expressed as to make it a suitabletext for his speech. If the measure is at all complicated, he will desire tohave its leading principles embodied in the opening clause or clauses^ sothat when the first fence is cleared the remainder of the course may becomparatively easy. In settling the order of the following clauses, he will consider what kind of opposition, and in what quarter, they are likely toevoke. He will prefer a few long clauses to many short ones, bearing inmind that each clause has, as a rule, to be separately put in Committee.His theoretical objections to legislation by reference will often yield toconsiderations of brevity. He will eschew technical terms, except where theyare clearly necessary, remembering that his proposals will have to beexpounded to, and understood by^ an assembly of laymen. . . . The drafts-man has, of course, to bear in mind all these considerations&quot;.1This is a classical description of the shifts to which a Government is driven bythe need to get its legislation passed by Parliament whatever shape the Bill maybe in when it receives the Royal Assent. Although the passage was written over70 years ago it enshrines an attitude which still seems to have much influence,as the criticisms to which we have earlier referred amply bear out.7.10 We recognise that any Government has a paramount interest in gettingits legislation, and much other business, through Parliament; whether thelegislation derives directly from a political commitment in a manifesto, or from1 Ilbert, Legislative Methods and Forms (Oxford 1901), pp 241-2.38
the pressure of events, or whether it grows naturally out of the ordinary workof Government departments. Indeed, we concede that there is substance in theviews advanced so long ago by Sir Courtenay Ilbert in the passage to which wehave referred. But if shortage of Parliamentary time tends to lead to the enact-ment of measures which do not adequately meet the needs of those who have touse it, then one of two courses will have to be adopted. Either the flow of legis-lation must be staunched so that the draftsmen may have more time in which tomake their Bills more intelligible, or, if this is impossible, then in spite of theshortage of time, statutes must be enacted by Parliament in a form that willmake it easier for them to be understood by those to whom they are addressed.7.11 However, some Parliamentarians feel strongly that nothing should bedone to hasten the legislative process. If there is now too much legislation, theyconsider that it would only make matters worse if the Government were to have at its disposal Parliamentary procedures and drafting practices which permittedeven more legislation to be produced in a given time. The aim must therefore beto achieve greater clarity without removing from Parliament the power to legislate as it thinks fit, in the hope that such power will be exercised withrestraint, responsibility and full regard for the need to achieve greater clarity inthe drafting. In Chapter XVIII we have applied our minds to parliamentary procedure to see whether ways may be found of achieving a better result bychanging the existing machinery, as our terms of reference enjoin us to do.(b) Pressure imposed on the draftsman by lack of time7.12 Next, the shortage of time available for preparing Bills often puts great pressure on the Parliamentary draftsman; and since draftsmen are human, the corollary is that the quality of their work is often at risk. First parliamentary counsel expressed this in the following way:&quot;All this makes for an undigested text, and a logical structure which isimperfectly worked out. Moreover, the pressure makes it difficult for the drafting team to prepare material to help in understanding the Bill when itfirst appears. Even drafting an Explanatory Memorandum may be aconsiderable task for a big Bill. The preparation of the occasional white paper by way of giving more detailed explanations of the text can be a burden so great that it interferes with the main object of getting the Billright&quot;.Sir John Fiennes recounted this experience:&quot;There was one occasion, on a Finance Bill, when I sat down on a Sundayat home and rewrote a whole Part of a Finance Bill. It went to the printeron Monday night, and the text was handed in at tea-time on Tuesday.The Revenue never saw the final version of that until the Bill was published&quot;.The needs of Parliament7.13 Members of Parliament in both Houses are busy people who have manyexacting demands on their time. Although some are highly skilled in the law,most Members are not familiar with legal concepts. It is therefore in their interests that Bills presented to them for enactment should be in a form whichis conducive to easy understanding of their effect. Mr Ian Percival QC MP whogave evidence to us stated:
&quot;The more simple and clear a Bill is when presented to Parliament,(a) the better it will be understood, and therefore the better it may beconsidered and discussed; (b) the less time it will take, and (c) the moresimple and clear it will be at the end&quot;.We take this to indicate that Members of Parliament are just as keen to have acomprehensible Bill to consider as the users are to receive a comprehensiblestatute. It should not be supposed that, in considering draft legislation, members are principally interested in scoring political points off their opponents with little regard for the final shape of a Bill as it leaves their House. On the contrary,Members often help to improve a Bill even when they are opposed to it. Never-theless, &quot;simplicity&quot; from the point of view of a legislator is not necessarilythe same thing as it is from the point of view of a practising lawyer or a judge.7.14 When a Member of Parliament is faced with a new Bill he wants to knowtwo things about it fairly quickly. First, what the Bill is intended to do, and secondly how it affects the interests of the constituents he represents. It hasuntil recently been assumed that it should be possible to gather this information from a study of the Bill itself, and that it should be the aim of the sponsor,whether this is the Government or a Private Member, to ensure that all theimportant information required is to be found within the pages of the Billwithout the need to read existing legislation on the same subject. Ever since theirOffice was established in 1869, the Parliamentary Counsel, and their Scottishcolleagues, have worked on the principle that, in the words of Lord Thring:&quot;It is not fair to a legislative assembly that they should, as a general rule,have to look beyond the four corners of a Bill in order to comprehend itsmeaning&quot;.7.15 How far Members of Parliament are able to understand the general purpose of many Bills without reference to other documents we could notdiscover, but one of our witnesses, Mr Francis Bennion, has expressed the viewthat:&quot;if Members were asked whether as a contribution to clarity they wouldbe prepared to give up the four corners doctrine, provided adequatealternative means of providing information were designed, my own feeling is that they would readily accept&quot;.If this is so, it would make it easier to amend existing enactments by the textualamendment method. The effect of the amending Bill would be shown either in aKeeling Schedule or in an accompanying memorandum (a &quot;textual memoran-dum&quot;) which would reprint passages of the earlier Act showing in a differenttype the amendments proposed to be made to those passages. Keeling Scheduleshave been used occasionally since 1938 and a textual memorandum has been used once. We do not believe either device has given rise to complaints byMembers of Parliament that they were not being given adequate information about the new measures they were enacting.7.16 Members of Parliament have a duty to criticise Bills presented to themand to amend them as they consider necessary. Sometimes their objections maybe on grounds that the legislation adversely affects the interests of those they represent; sometimes they have personal experience which is relevant to the
subject matter of the Bill. Frequently amendments are designed to ensure thatthe Bill will have a particular effect in certain circumstances. Few Bills pass through Parliament unaltered. When amending them Parliaments paramountinterest is with the substance rather than the form. But, even when agreedamendments are drafted by the draftsman in charge of the Bill, the final productmay still not be satisfactory to the user. Several witnesses have suggested to us that there should be a stage at which Parliament scrutinises the drafting of aBill after it has been considered and amended, but before it is enacted. Weexamine this possibility further in Chapter XVIII.DIFFICULTY OF ATTRACTING ENOUGH SUITABLEPARLIAMENTARY DRAFTSMEN7.17 The drafting of legislation is an exacting vocation which demands a high degree of intellectual ability, a sound knowledge of the law, the ability to writegood English and an unlimited capacity for sustained hard work. These qualitiesdo not often come together in the same individual, and lawyers with such giftswill have other attractive opportunities for advancement in their profession.Though we believe that there can be few more worthwhile careers for ablelawyers on both sides of the Border than the work of constructing the statutorylaw, we are bound to recognise that the attractions of private practice at presentmake it more difficult to interest good candidates in taking up appointments asdraftsmen. Our terms of reference do not permit us to consider how this situation might be altered, but it is obvious that the quality of our legislationdepends largely on the quality of our draftsmen. Also, if there are not enoughgood draftsmen to cope with the regular flow of new legislation, this will makeit more difficult to release some of them to carry out consolidation which is sourgently necessary if the statute book is to be brought into orderly shape withina reasonable period of time. We deal with the recruitment and training of thedraftsmen in Chapter VIII.conclusion.18 As we have surveyed the criticism we have received and the factors whichhave to be taken into account in suggesting remedies, we have become conscious that no great improvement in the preparation of legislation is likely to come about solely as a result of changes in Parliamentary procedure or draftingconventions, useful though some such changes might be. The words of SirGranville Ram, formerly First Parliamentary Counsel, writing in 1946, sound anote of warning:&quot;The chaotic condition of the statute book has been the subject of complaint for at least four hundred years, and it must be acknowledgedthat the long history of the intermittent attempts to improve its form andarrangement is, in the main, a story of failure&quot;.However, nearly all those who have given evidence to us agree that somethingmust be done to improve matters, and according to their different responsibilitieshave made suggestions as to what this might be.7.19 We have found a great willingness on the part of some of those who havedifferent tasks to perform in relation to statute law to accommodate eachother&apos;s difficulties. Thus the judges would be glad to face the problems of
interpretation if statutes gave less detailed guidance but were more simplydrafted and more fully expressed the general intentions of Parliament; andthe team engaged in preparing the legislation would be more ready to draftby expressing general principles appropriate to the subject matter if Governmentand Parliament were less demanding in their desire to have every foreseeablecircumstance met by detailed drafting which confuses the outline of the draftsman&apos;s scheme.7.20 But much more than good will and self-restraint are needed to make thestatute book an orderly repository of reasonably intelligible law: governments must give the state of our legislation a much higher priority in their respon-sibilities. The legislative process is the main instrument of political change inour rapidly changing democracy, but it has for many years been incapable ofefficiently meeting the demands made upon it. Serious defects of the processare the shortage of Parliamentary draftsmen and the resulting pressure imposedupon them. Until that shortage is overcome and the pressure reduced, the instrument will become even more inadequate and ineffective, and politicalchange will continue to be made under stress, in some confusion, and withunwelcome results.7.21 The ideal solution of the problems we have described might be to have all statutes drafted in clear and simple language which the layman couldunderstand and which at the same time achieved the certainty of effect in law which Parliament expressly intended, however conflicting these two praiseworthyobjects may be. There are also those who advocate a &quot;crash programme&quot;of consolidation with a view to rearranging the statute book. The argument isthat such a rearrangement would facilitate the amendment of Acts bythe textual amendment method and would make it easier for the user to find the enactments in which he is interested. We deal with this suggestion more fully in Chapter XIV, and at this stage we merely point out that such a programme ofconsolidation could only be achieved by recruiting and training many moredraftsmen. Even if this were done, and even if enough lawyers achieved enoughdrafting skill, Parliament would have to stop legislating for a good many years in some areas of law so as not to confuse the consolidation programme byinterim amendments of existing legislation. Such an exercise is therefore in the realm of fantasy, and meanwhile we have to approach our task by makingrealistic assumptions in the search for remedies which take account of the factors we have mentioned above.
Chapter viii the DRAFTSMAN&apos;S PRESENT DIFFICULTIES8.1 In the previous chapter we referred in passing to the Parliamentarydraftsmen and the crucial part they play in the preparation of legislation.We now turn to consider certain factors which govern and in some casesinhibit the effective application of their skill.8.2 The draftsman of a Bill requires (i) adequate instructions; (ii) adequateconsultation at all stages with the departmental team working on the Bill,and (iii) above all, adequate time to study the legislative background to the Bill,to consider the best structure for it, and to prepare the draft, which if the Billis long or complex or both may involve weeks of sustained concentration.The first and second of those requirements are generally met. As regards thesecond requirement, we would emphasise that the Minister who presents a Billto Parliament is finally responsible for its drafting, and that while the draftsmenwelcome the opportunity of discussion with the Minister the amount of such discussion that takes place depends on him. The third requirement is oftenlacking, and drafting suffers as a result.PRESSURE OF TIME8.3 Nearly all Bills in the Government^ legislative programme are preparedunder pressure, generated either by the need to keep to a predetermined Parlia-mentary timetable for the Session as a whole or by the urgency of the particularBill. Consequently the draftsman&apos;s life is an arduous one, and his hours of work are often long and unpredictable. Although we have had no complaints on thatscore from any of those draftsmen who gave evidence to us, the draftsmenare the first to recognise that the pressures under which they work may affectthe quality of their output. As First Parliamentary Counsel put it: &quot;By the timeinstructions are received, there may not be much room for the draftsman totake decisions which will make for simplicity or clarity. I find it frequentlycomes as a surprise to a member of the public, and even to members of thelegal profession, to hear how little elbow room the draftsman has . . . the pressure to get things done quickly is usually great&quot;.8.4 Political exigencies will continue to demand immediate legislation, andsome system of programming will continue to be necessary for all legislation.Given that programming is necessary the date of introduction into Parliamentbecomes important. Indeed it can become more important than the initialcontent of the Bill, so that (probably to the detriment of the structure andexpression of the Bill) the process of drafting will have to be continued afterintroduction by means of Government amendments moved in Parliament.Our terms of reference do not permit discussion of the legislative programme assuch, but we feel free to take note that sheer pressure of time constitutes a formidable obstacle in the way of any significant improvement in the readability
of Acts of Parliament. Accordingly we would urge that by forward planning and early starting of legislative projects everything possible should be done to seethat the unavoidable pressure is not increased by avoidable factors.INSTRUCTIONS TO draft the &quot;grey area&quot;8.5 Our terms of reference also exclude &quot;consideration of matters relating to policy formulation&quot;, but between the taking of policy decisions and the start of the drafting process, and shading into that process, is what First parliamentary counsel has called &quot;the grey area&quot;. This is the area in which policy decisions are translated into instructions to the draftsman, and instructions may be modified, more or less substantially, in the course of conferences and exchanges of letters between the draftsman and the instructing department or departments.It seems to us that what happens in the grey area is relevant to the attainment of clarity and simplicity in the legislation emerging from it and should thereforebe among the things considered by us.Departmental expertise8.6  Of the grey area First Parliamentary Counsel has said:&quot;If there is more than one way of carrying out some feature of thepolicy, those responsible for the instructions must be able to assess well inadvance how the choice will be reflected in the Bill. If some policy decisionsseem likely to lead to some complexity, and that can be foreseen, theremay be room for a review of the position and a request to Ministers to reconsider the policy. Some minor change may make things simpler&quot;.If this be right (as we think it is) those concerned in this area should be givenadequate time for their work and should possess a high degree of skill and legalexperience. The draftsman should have some part in it, even if only by way ofsuggesting modifications of his instructions in order to obtain greater simplicityand clarity. Clearly, the more expert the departmental lawyers and adminis-administrators in the official team instructing him, the easier the draftsman&apos;s task willbe; and this is likely to be reflected in the quality of the Bill.Stage at which draftsman becomes involved8.7 Several witnesses, among them the experienced draftsmen mentionedbelow, have suggested to us that the draftsman should always become involvedat an early stage. Professor Driedger described the practice in Canada, where&quot;the person who ultimately will be the draftsman is frequently brought into discussions with officials and ministers when the policy is being developed, andhe then has a chance to say what can be done, what cannot be clearly expressed,what will work and what will not work&quot;, and where &quot;there is perhaps a closerand less formal relationship between draftsmen, officials and ministers at all stages of a drafting process&quot;; he thought that this did &quot;contribute something to the form and clarity of the statute&quot;. Professor Dickerson believes that &quot;ifbrought in early enough, a draftsman, as a legal architect and engineer, can. . . help the policy makers formulate a better and more workable idea . . .If the draftsmen are not brought in until the end, they cannot be as helpful as
they might be . . . When the matter begins to crystallise in its general architectural-tecture, the draftsman should be on hand to help formulate this, because themechanics of formulating general structure . . . floats to the surface manyoverlaps, gaps and discrepancies that it is valuable to discover at the outset&quot;.8.8 We understand that in principle participation by the draftsman in West-minster legislation does not begin until he has received written instructions inwhich the policy to be given effect to by a Bill (or part of a Bill) has been moreor less fully worked out. First Parliamentary Counsel told us that the questionof earlier involvement was at present governed by considerations of manpower;it might be looked at again if the manpower position became easier, though hethought that even then there was a strong case for not bringing in the draftsmanat an earlier stage. Although in cases where pressure was great the draftsmanwas in fact coming in long before the legislative scheme was fully settled, asa matter of policy the question did not arise at the moment. On the otherhand, bearing in mind the pressure already referred to, it is important that time should not be lost in departmental and interdepartmental discussion of draft instructions to the point where all except the draftsman have agreed uponmatters on which his advice would have been useful or even decisive. There isa dilemma here. Premature instructions may be worse than useless: but time spent on revising and polishing draft instructions reduces both the time availableto draft the Bill itself and the utility of the draftsman&apos;s contribution.8.9 It is not for us to suggest any general rule governing the precise stage atwhich the draftsman should begin to take part in the preparation of legislation.To the extent that an answer is not dictated by circumstances, it seems to us thatthe question is one for the First Parliamentary Counsel and the First Parlia-mentary Draftsman for Scotland to consider in making the best use of their colleagues&apos; time.8.10 At present a special problem exists for the Scottish draftsman who hasto adapt an English Bill to Scotland, for in such a case, under the existing practice, the Scottish draftsman enters the scene somewhat later than theEnglish. If, however, our recommendations in Chapter XII for Bills affectingboth jurisdictions are adopted there would be a complete abandonment of thepresent method of preparation whereby legislation designed only for Englandand Wales is adapted for application to Scotland. The new method we proposewould mean that such a Bill would involve both draftsmen from the start, andthe question of the stage at which the Scottish draftsman should become involved would in that even cease to be a special problem.THE STATE OF THE STATUTE BOOK8.11 Each draftsman has to have a complete set of the statutes, fully amended.No draftsman can do his work properly without being thus equipped: thestatute book is his workbench. The draftsmen need a clean edition of the statute book if they are to do their work properly, and they have not now got it.The official editions of the statutes have been described in Chapter V. Until alarge part of Statutes in Force has been published, the official editions on whichthe draftsmen must mainly rely are the third edition of Statutes Revised, con-taining in chronological order all English public general enactments from 1235
to 1707 and public general enactments of the United Kingdom Parliamentfrom 1707 (all as they were in force at the end of 1948) other than certain enact-ments relating exclusively to Northern Ireland; the second revised edition ofThe Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland 1424-1707, containing all Scottish publicgeneral enactments in force in 1966; the annual volumes of Public General Actsand Measures for 1949 and subsequent years; and Queen&apos;s Printers copies ofrecent enactments not yet incorporated in the latest annual volume. first parliamentary Counsel estimates that &quot;the draftsmen, and all others in theGovernment service, will still be using the third chronological edition [of statues Revised] at least 30 years after its publication&quot;, in other words that although it &quot;is on its last legs... it will probably have to remain in use for atleast five or six years&quot;.8.12 The drafting offices thus have to contend with two major difficulties:the first is the clerical burden of maintaining completely annotated sets ofthis material for the draftsmen&apos;s use (21,000 entries per set over the last fiveyears), and the near impossibility of annotating additional sets from scratchif the number of draftsmen increases. (As we have said in paragraph 5.15above, it is estimated that the annotation of a complete set would take a trainedclerk nearly a year). The second is the intellectual (and to some extent, no doubt,physical) difficulty of operating on this mass of unintegrated material in draftingboth new and consolidating Bills.8.13 The physical untidiness of the statute book can be, and is being, tackledby the production of the new collected edition, Statutes in Force. Completion ishoped for by 1980. First Parliamentary Counsel accepts, with some hesitation,that this edition will serve the draftsmen&apos;s purpose when complete. He tellsus that the Statutory Publications Office will be offering an updating serviceof a different kind from that available for the third edition of Statutes Revised;the annual supplement to the whole edition will be on the lines of thesupplement to Halsbur/s Statutes.8.14 The production of any form of collected edition, however, can do no more than tidy the statute book in a physical sense. Repealed matter wouldbe omitted, and textual amendments incorporated in reprinted versions of theActs amended. Other amendments, applications, and the like, would continueto be found separately from the provisions to which they refer. The intellectualburden of conflating separate enactments to discover their combined effect would, in a large measure, remain. First Parliamentary Counsel says: &quot;A tidystatute book is very necessary as a background for satisfactory legislation. Ifa Bill must operate on an untidy code, it slows up the team handling the Bill,and makes it more difficult for the legislator and the public to understand the Bill&quot;. In assessing the degree of untidiness of the present statute book hearrived at an estimate, for the years from 1921 to 1960 alone, of between 350and 400 Acts so heavily amended and fragmented (and consequently so heavilyannotated) that they could properly be described as being in an unsatisfactory state and in need of consolidation. We agree with most of our witnesses inattaching importance to consolidation, the repeal of spent enactments, the useof textual amendment wherever practicable. We consider textual amendmentand consolidation in more detail in Chapters XIII and XIV. We discuss in chapter XVI the potential advantages of a computerised statute book.
MANPOWERRecruitment and training8.15 The staffs of the Parliamentary Counsel Office and the office of theParliamentary Draftsman for Scotland (the Lord Advocated Department) are small (details of their composition are given in Chapter III). There is anacknowledged shortage of draftsmen in the public service and the aim is to achieve an increase in the strength of the Parliamentary Counsel Office ifpossible. The Parliamentary Draftsman for Scotland also has difficulty in securing enough recruits of the required calibre.8.16 Reasons suggested for these recruiting difficulties include a lack ofinterest in statute law in the universities. We understand that the whole questionof closer contacts between universities and the legal civil service is underconsideration at the moment. The encouragement of an interest in statute lawas part of the academic training of lawyers would be regarded by the draftingoffices and by us as helpful to recruiting. We have also given thought to thepossibility of setting up in this country a post-graduate course of training in legislative drafting such as the one-year course for seven or eight graduatesprovided by Professor Driedger at the University of Ottawa.1 Training hasup to now, in both the English and the Scottish offices, been mainly a matterof working with a senior colleague in order to develop the necessary specialisedskills on the job. We agree that pupillage of this kind is indispensable to thetraining of a draftsman to the stage at which he could draft a big Bill underpressure; but we consider that a course such as Professor Driedger&apos;s could be helpful in providing preliminary training so as to reduce the period of apprentiship and to ease the burden of the senior draftsmen in training newrecruits from scratch, and that serious consideration should be given to thepossibility of setting one up. It might help to attract more young lawyers intothe drafting offices and to promote a better understanding of drafting problems.Experience shows that only a trained draftsman can provide such a course, andthis presents a difficulty which must not be underestimated.\\Outside help8.17 The suggestion has come to us from a number of quarters that theGovernment draftsmen could be relieved of some of their burden by entrustingthe drafting of some Government Bills to lawyers outside the public service,including practising members of both branches of the legal profession (includingParliamentary Agents) and academics. As we mentioned in Chapter III, first parliamentary Counsel now has authority to make arrangements for some government Bills to be drafted by outside draftsmen. An experimental scheme The course, which can lead to a Master&apos;s degree in law, is divided into lectures (on aspectsof legislation other than drafting) and seminars (devoted to theoretical and practical instruction in legislative expression). The weekly exercises set for the seminars are progressively moredifficult, moving from the analysis and re-casting of existing legislative provisions to originaldrafting on instructions, and students&apos; drafts are all discussed and criticised by ProfessorDriedgar at the seminars. Towards the end of the course students are required to re-writesome of their earlier drafts in the light of experience gained during the course, and thesere-drafts are discussed by the Professor with each student individually. There are writtenexaminations on the material covered by the lectures, but students are graded on their seminarwork according to the Professor&apos;s judgement of the quality of their work throughout the yearand the progress they have made. In each year the course comprises from 4 to 6 Canadianstudents, the balance coming from other Commonwealth countries.
has recently been evolved under which the drafting of some Government or government-supported Bills, and the subsequent responsibility for them, canbe &quot;farmed out&quot; to a member of a panel of Parliamentary Agents. first parliamentary Counsel thinks there is a prospect of some success in this field;although it is not easy to fit the Parliamentary Agents in for a number of reasons they have, he says, been most co-operative and helpful and he hopesto go on getting a contribution from them. For a number of reasons it has not proved possible to get work done by practising members of the Bar. first parliamentary Counsel told us that he thought that on the whole the experienceof the practitioner at the Bar could no longer be said to be of much value inthe general field of legislative drafting; although we feel that specialists inparticular branches of the law would often be able to give advice on draft bills which would give warning of pitfalls or loopholes, and that the practice of consulting them should be encouraged.8.18 We think that the scope for the employment of draftsmen outside thepublic service on Bills in the Government legislative programme must remainlimited by such factors as the need for the draftsman to be in a position to nursehis Bill through Parliament. The scope for their employment on consolidationBills may be somewhat greater, though even there the difficulties which wouldbe experienced by a practitioner should not be underestimated: they includethe obtaining of ready access to an up-to-date set of the official volumes of statues (see paragraph 8.11 above) and to the draftsman&apos;s papers on the Actsto be consolidated. We should in any case deprecate any large-scale transfer of drafting work away from the Government draftsmen, as being liable to result ina return to the pre-1869 situation (the legislation of the eighteenth and earlynineteenth centuries has been described by one of the present draftsmen as&quot;a jungle . . . drafted by different people who neither knew nor cared how theother performers were framing their legislation&quot;). The centralisation of Englishdrafting in the Parliamentary Counsel Office, staffed by full-time professionals,has been favourably contrasted by Professor Reed Dickerson with the situationin Washington:&quot;Whereas in London the typical bill is drafted by a full-time professional,in Washington it is drafted by an inexperienced lawyer ... or a partlyexperienced lawyer whose drafting duties are a mere incident to his other duties .... Certainly the most fertile single source of confused, difficult-to-read, overlapping and conflicting statutes is the lack of uniformity inapproach, terminology and style. The ravages of heterogeneous authorshipappear to be large in Washington and small in London&quot;.1Professor Dickerson also developed this theme in the evidence he gave to us:&quot;Most legislation in the United States is drafted by people who, howevergood they may be in their substantive specialities, have only fleetingacquaintance with the expertise required for good drafting. This is perhaps the main reason why so much of American legislation is inadequate... Youare light years ahead of us in this respect&quot;.It therefore seems to us that it would be better to increase the strength of thedraftsmen&apos;s offices than to rely to any great extent upon outside help.1 Legislative Drafting in London and Washington [1959] Cambridge Law Journal, p 49.
Other duties8.19 Whilst Parliamentary Counsel, and in particular the First parliamentary counsel, have certain other duties as well as their primary drafting function(see Chapter III), we are told that these are not particularly burdensome.Drafting work for the Law Commission ought not to be in direct competition with work on the current legislative programme, and on the establishmentof the Commission arrangements, described in paragraph 3.2 above, weremade with that end in view. However, we have been informed that the exigencies of the Governments current legislative programme, coupled withother factors which have affected the balance between drafting resources and thedemands made upon them, have led to the temporary withdrawal from theservice of the Law Commission of one senior draftsman who had previously been assigned exclusively to Law Commission work. This is a misfortune forthe causes of law reform and of consolidation, and we recommend that theLaw Commissions drafting strength should be restored and, indeed, further increased at the earliest possible moment.8.20 The position of the Scottish Parliamentary Draftsmen is rather different.In addition to a commitment to provide draftsmen for the Scottish law commission, the draftsmen have very substantial non-drafting duties as legalsecretaries to the Lord Advocate, as described in Chapter III. We have been told by the Parliamentary Draftsman for Scotland that although this work isshared by his staff, the main burden of the more confidential and sensitive workfalls on him as Legal Secretary, and that for more than a decade it has tended to absorb the greater part of his and his predecessors&apos; time; a similar process(especially in relation to European Community matters) is now happening tothe Deputy Legal Secretary (the second Draftsman), with the result that the twomost experienced draftsmen are having less and less time to devote to legislation.Whilst the Parliamentary Draftsman for Scotland saw some advantage inclose contact with the Law Officers, he could see no other reason why the twooffices of Parliamentary Draftsman and Legal Secretary which had becomecombined as the result of the historical development outlined in Chapter II should remain combined. We feel considerable sympathy with that point ofview.8.21 The giving of drafting assistance for Private Members&apos; Bills is a call onthe resources of the two offices which we think should be confined at present to Bills which enjoy Government support or which the Government do notovertly support but which they consider may reach the statute book. With thelarger work force which we recommend, the Government could and should then give more generous departmental and drafting support in future to private members&apos; Bills which the Government do not actively oppose.conclusion.22 The shortage of draftsmen is one of the main obstacles to the improvementof the form and clarity of legislation, and we recommend that all availablemethods should be used to recruit and train more draftsmen as a matter of high priority.
PARLIAMENTARY AND OTHER CONSTRAINTS8.23 There are certain other factors which may present the draftsman with difficulties but which we deal with in later chapters. These are the demand forcertainty both from the Government and from Parliament (Chapter X), therequirements of Parliamentary procedure and tactics (Chapter XVIII), and theinterpretation of statutes by the courts (Chapter XIX).
Chapter IXBRITISH AND EUROPEAN APPROACHES TO legislation the APPROACH IN EUROPEAN LAW9.1 European law is basically very different from English law, foundedas it is on another legal tradition deriving largely from Roman law, laterdeveloped to suit modern needs by, for example, the Code Napoleon. The styleof the Code is illustrated by many of the codifications of the nineteenth century.The deliberate aim in these codes was to confine the statement of terms toprinciples of wide application, and to practise a deliberate restraint in theproliferation of detailed rules. An extreme example of this is to be found inArticle 1382 of the French Civil Code which states &quot;Any act whatsoever by aman that causes damage to another obliges the person at fault to repair the damage&quot;.THE APPROACH IN ENGLAND AND WALES9.2 In England and Wales there has grown up over the centuries what maybe described as the &quot;detailed&quot; approach to legislation. For a variety of reasonsGovernments tend to propose, and Parliament to elaborate further, legislation which spells out how a principle of law which is being enacted should apply in a great variety of circumstances. The rationale of this approach is that it isonly fair to those whom the law will affect that they should be able to see how Parliament requires the law to be applied in differing circumstances, andthat it creates uncertainty if the detailed application of a general principle is leftto be interpreted by the judiciary, or to be worked out by the Executive inregulations embodied in subordinate legislation. Sometimes the statutes contain a mass of detail without clearly expressing the purpose or the principles whichhave prompted it.THE APPROACH IN SCOTLAND9.3 The law of Scotland has enough in common with European tradition forthe substantive as distinct from the procedural law still to be recognisablywithin the family of the civil law. A very considerable part of the present law ofScotland, however, comprises statutes of the United Kingdom Parliament,which in general follow the English approach, and it is this part of the law withwhich we are concerned. The fact that the common law of Scotland has strongeraffinities with civil law systems of Europe than that of England does not affectthe validity in this context of discussing English and Scottish statute lawtogether.THE APPROACHES EXAMINED9.4 In the following paragraphs we examine these differences in traditionmore closely and assess how far they are reflected in the present practice of western European countries and of the European Communities.
9.5 It has been put to us by Sir Charles Davis1 that it is still true to say that whilst in English statute law more emphasis is placed on certainty, in thelegislation of Continental countries and of the European Communities the emphasis is on clarity in the expression of broad intention and principles.Sir Charles said:&quot;English law, being for historical reasons so firmly based on the doctrine of stare decisis has an inherent tendency, in my view, towards achievingcertainty sometimes indeed at the expense of logic and this is reflectednot only in our Common Law but also in our legislation, both originaland delegated. This is customarily drafted with almost mathematicalprecision, the object (not always attained) being in effect to provide acomplete answer to virtually every question that can arise. Communitylaw on the other hand, being based on the legal systems of the originalsix member states, and being thus derived from the Code Napoleon and indirectly from Roman law, adopts an entirely different approach. Withthe Community law, certainty in other words the ability to answer almost every question that can arise by textual analysis is much less important,and the main desideratum appears to be the logical formulation of anidea so that the general objective of the legislation is never lost sight of.. ..Both systems have their advantages and disadvantages. Under our ownsystem the goal of certainty is sometimes achieved at the expense of acomplexity which it is hard (and sometimes virtually impossible) for thelayman to master. On the other hand Community secondary legislation which is fully reasoned in recitals (as indeed it is required to be underArticle 190 of the Treaty of Rome), and with its much more generalisedlegislative provisions, is easier to understand at first reading, but suffersfrom the corresponding disadvantage that it is often impossible by referenceto the text alone to say exactly what is the answer to a particular problem.This makes for doubts and uncertainties which can in the last resort onlybe resolved by the European Court whose guiding principle it seems to beto look to the intent rather than to the form. . . . Essentially, the dilemmaseems to me to be a choice between two eminently desirable but mutuallyexclusive objectives namely clarity and certainty&quot;.9.6 The difference between the English and Continental traditions is also recognised in a memorandum we received from the Foreign and commonwealth office:&quot;The drafting of Community legislation is largely influenced by traditions of legislative drafting which have for long prevailed in other european countries but which do not prevail in the United Kingdom. The traditionin many other European countries is to draft in more general terms than iscustomary in this country, and consequently to leave more scope for theinterpretation of the law by the courts; the continental judge is accustomed to interpret legislation in the light of official or academic commentaries.Because of this difference of approach, the form and language of community legislation does not readily lend itself to emulation in theUnited Kingdom where the courts and legal professions are accustomed to more precise drafting, and interpretation or construction keeps morestrictly to the statutory text&quot;._1 Legal Adviser to the House of Commons Select Committee on European SecondaryLegislation.
9.7  Of European Community legislation Sir Charles Sopwith1 says:&quot;Given the circumstances in which that legislation has been adopted, theCommunity legal order corresponds to expectation. The Treaties werearrived at by negotiation and compromise; in the result they are ample onaims but tend to lack precision. The draftsmen of the secondary legislationhave no doubt been accustomed to a less precise system of drafting than thataimed at in this country; and much of this secondary legislation is also thesubject of debate by and negotiation between the representatives of the member States and to eventual compromise so that again great precisioncan not always be expected&quot;.And Professor D Lasok2 confirmed in a letter to us that:&quot;It can be said, generally, that the Community legislation follows thecontinental pattern, ie translating policies into rules of general application and proceeding from the general to the particular. The legislation is not as tightly drafted as our own statutes, allowing those who apply the lawsa certain &quot;margin of appreciation&quot; in the interpretation of the rules oflaw&quot;.9.8 A feature of Community secondary legislation (though not of examples of European national legislation that we have examined) is the invariable useof a preamble, now rare in British statutes. It is, as Sir Charles Davis pointsout, obligatory under Article 190 of the Treaty of Rome. Sir Charles Sopwithsuggests that&quot;It seems probable that the original purpose of requiring the Reasoning&apos;to be stated was not so much to assist interpretation as to enable member states and persons affected by Community instruments to ascertain thatthe Council or Commission was acting properly within its powers. . . .These preambles have, however, no doubt come to have an important effect on interpretation . . . against the background of the (European)Courfs method of interpretation which seeks to give effect to the purposesof the legislation, on which a preamble may well be expected to furnishvaluable help. But while the preambles in Community legislation are not solikely to furnish help on particular verbal difficulties, they do undoubtedlygive a good deal of help towards the general intelligibility of a Communityinstrument&quot;.9.9 The difference between the two drafting traditions is clear. In practice,however, when British legislation is compared with both Community legislation and the national legislation of Continental countries, the differences betweenthe products of the two traditions are seen to be sometimes blurred. WhilstBritish legislation for the most part aims at precision or certainty, and con-sequently tends to be elaborate and detailed, one can in certain fields findWestminster legislation that is expressed in statements of general principles.An example of this is the Occupiers Liability Act 1957, mentioned by the dis-distinguished comparative lawyer Professor Otto Kahn-Freund in the passagequoted in the next paragraph.1 Legal Adviser to the Select Committee of the House of Lords on the european communities.2 Director of the Centre for European Legal Studies, University of Exeter.
9.10 Of national legislation on the Continent, Professor Kahn-Freund saidto us in oral evidence:&quot;If I take the two countries I know best, France and Germany, I would agree that there is this type of legislation which is designed to lay downgeneral principles and to do what the courts are supposed to do in thiscountry. I pointed out that there are statutes in this country such as the occupier&apos;s Liability Act, which is a totally different style of legislation, buton the other hand you find in the continental countries the type of detailedminute legislation, not terribly different from what you find in this country.If you take France and if you take what the French call public law, which means administrative law, you will not find the general principles in the statutes you will find them in the case law of the Conseil d&apos;Etat and the statutes are a chaotic mass of detail not all that different from what we havehere. The same could be said about Germany. This is not so much aquestion of something else being substituted for what we have here but rather one could say there are two different kinds of legislation there islegislation designed to establish the broad principles, and there is legislation for example tax law, which goes into the greatest possible details.&quot;For example, the Federal German Added Value Tax Law of 1967 runs to some57 pages of print, despite a deliberate effort to keep it short by incorporating theprovisions of other laws by reference in more than 50 instances (and accordingto the editors of an English translation it &quot;can hardly be understood withoutprofessional advice&quot;).9.11 On the content of European Community secondary legislation, theForeign and Commonwealth Office memorandum quoted in paragraph 9.6 hasthis to say:&quot;Community Regulations often contain matters normally found in both primary and secondary legislation, with the result that in addition tothe very general provisions already referred to there will frequently beminutely detailed provisions, sometimes of a purely administrativecharacter, in the same instrument&quot;.And clarity is sometimes sacrificed to expediency:&quot;Like the Treaties themselves, this so-called secondary Communitylaw is sometimes ambiguously or incompletely drafted. Political corn-promises are often attained by the use of ambiguous words&quot;.19.12 Although much European legislation is also detailed and complexit does tend, in contrast with our own, to set out the objectives to be achieved,leaving the detailed methods of application to the courts or to detailed ruleslaid down by the Executive within the powers conferred upon it. This difference in traditional approach between Europe and this country in the formulation oflaw has also led to a difference in the rules of interpretation applied by thecourts. In Europe since the tendency is to rely more on general principles, it is perhaps natural that the rules of interpretation permit the courts to look beyondthe statute to ascertain the intention of the legislature, and doing this they may1 Brinkhorst and Schermers, Judicial Remedies in the European Communities, p 22 (quoted by Sir Charles Sopwith).
use various documents other than the statute, classified under the generalheading of travaux preparatoires. The judge in European countries has for hissupport a number of interpretative guides. When interpreting the provisions ofcodified legislation he is by training and experience imbued with the spiritof that legislation, its intention and its historical setting. He can reason byanalogy from other articles. He can look at travaux preparatoires, where they exist. He has the persuasive, but not binding, assistance of whatever juris-prudence (ie case-law) has been built up upon the matter in point. He caninterpret in changed social conditions in the way that best corresponds with thecontemporary view of social justice, provided that he does not do too muchviolence to the literal meaning of the words being interpreted. It is also to beborne in mind that the European judge (unlike the United Kingdom judge) neednot take account of what the law was before the passing of the particularenactment with which he is concerned. Legislation is, on the matters to which itextends, for him the unique source of law: it is not an intruder into an area ofcommon law.9.13 In this country on the other hand, since the tendency is to spell out the lawin great detail, the rules of interpretation are narrower and  though perhapsless so in the case of the Scottish courts the courts look at the meaning of thewords of the statute and do not tend to go behind those words in order toestablish the intention of the legislature. In other words the courts presume thatthe legislature knew exactly what it wished to do and has done it, and nofilling in is required.9.14 In the light of this explanation it can be seen that the traditional approachin Europe has been to express the law in general principles, relying upon thecourts and the Executive to fill in the details necessary for the application ofthe statutory propositions to particular cases, in the light of the general intentionof the legislature expressed in preambles, recitals and other documents. this approach appears to result in simpler and clearer primary legislation wheredetail is omitted, but equally it lacks the greater certainty which a detailedlegislative application of the principles would provide. Here on the other hand the traditional approach has been to spell out in the statutes themselves the precise way in which the law is to apply in differing circumstances. This givesgreater certainty in respect of the circumstances provided for, and it is not necessary to wait for rulings by the courts on particular applications; but itleads to more complex legislation which is less clear to the ordinary reader.
Chapter XCONFLICTSCONFLICTING NEEDS: THE BILL AND THE ACT10.1 As we have said in Chapter VII, there is often a conflict between the needsof legislators when they have to carry a Bill into law and those of the ultimateusers of the Act which the Bill then becomes. One aspect of this conflict was described some years ago by a member of our Committee:&quot;The same document has to be designed to satisfy two distinct legislativeaudiences: first (in point of time) the Parliamentary audience, mainlycomposed of laymen, whose primary need is to ascertain, with the minimum of labour and preferably no reference to any document other than the bill itself, what is the general purpose and effect of each clause or sectionwhich they are asked to pass; and secondly, the expert lawyers and otherprofessionals who will seek to find in the Act as passed a specific answer to each specific question upon which they have to advise or decide. Onecustomer wants a picture and the other wants a Bradshaw&quot;.1We would qualify this by adding that in most spheres the ultimate users of theAct will include not only the professionals, but also the ordinary citizen who is bound by, and presumed to know about, the provisions of the Act of Parliament;and that the professional and other users of the Act need the picture for somepurposes and the Bradshaw for others. In other words the conflict is not only between the needs of the legislators and those of consumers: it is also betweendiffering needs of consumers on different occasions.10.2 The conflict between the needs of the Minister or Member in chargeof the Bill and those of the ultimate users was described by Sir CourtenayIlbert, in a passage from which we have already quoted at greater length, asfollows: &quot;A Bill. . . may be regarded from two points of view. From one point of view it is a future law. From another point of view it is a proposalsubmitted for the favourable consideration of a popular assembly. And thetwo points of view are not always consistent&quot;. The second of these points of view has hitherto been the dominant one.10.3 We recommend that in principle the interests of the ultimate users should always have priority over those of the legislators: a Bill, which serves a merelytemporary purpose, should always be regarded primarily as a future Act, andshould be drafted and arranged with this object in view. We discuss in ChaptersXIII, XV, and XVIII some possible ways of reconciling the conflict, where itoccurs, in accordance with this general principle.1 Sir Noel Hutton, (1961) 24 Modern Law Review, p. 21.56
CONFLICTING OBJECTIVES: SIMPLICITY ANDCLARITY V. IMMEDIATE CERTAINTY    sThe demand for immediate certainty10.4 The prime duty of the draftsman of a Government Bill, and of the officialsinstructing him, is to make sure (i) that the Bill accurately achieves the legaleffects which the Government wants, and (ii) that as far as possible those effectscan be recognised immediately, without confirmation by decisions in the courts.These two desiderata, taken together, we refer to as &quot;immediate certainty&quot;.10.5 Instructions normally go into considerable detail, and where they do notthe draftsman will usually feel obliged to ask for them to be amplified. Theinstructing department may in turn question whether a clause as draftedachieves the desired result in particular cases and with sufficient certainty,and may draw attention to possible ambiguities and methods of avoidance.All the doubts and criticisms that emerge in &quot;the grey area&quot;1 and during thepassage of the Bill through Parliament have to be taken seriously, and maybe found to call for more detail in the Bill. All this makes for complexity:there are few occasions, says First Parliamentary Counsel, when the draftsmanand the instructing department &quot;can confidently assure the Government that something relatively brief will do what they want&quot;.10.6 The demand for elaboration comes not only from the Governmentand the instructing department but also from Parliament itself. First Parlia-mentary Counsel put the position to us in these words &quot;For good reason, Parliament is rarely ready to accept a simplificationif it means potential injustice in any class of case, however small. Inparticular, this is true of everything in a Bill which intervenes in privatelife, or in business. Powers of entry, and powers of obtaining information,will be looked at jealously. And much detail will often be needed before theGovernment is likely to be able to persuade Parliament that in this fieldno more than essential powers are being taken by the proposed legislation...In many of the fields in which legislation is frequent, broad propositionsmay be, or may appear to be, oppressive. Parliament may insist that therights of the citizen should be spelt out precisely and may well refuseto accept the argument that the way the legislation is to be worked outcan be left to the courts&quot;.On the other hand we have not failed to notice that individual Parliamentariansare often vehement in their condemnation of detail and elaboration. As wesaid in paragraph 1.10, they cannot have it both ways.10.7 The draftsman is at present often constrained by this approach toinclude a good deal of detail, in order to provide expressly for different com-binations of circumstances, and so to express himself as to eliminate or reduce to the minimum the need for clarification by the courts and the risk of judicialinterpretation in a sense contrary to that intended. Of course, judges endeavourin the interpretation of Acts of Parliament to give effect to the intentions of the legislature as expressed in the Act, but in modern times when the state  See Chapter VIII.
intervenes to regulate the life of the individual with very great minutenessthose intentions will not necessarily be clear unless spelt out in very great detail. At any rate that feeling is undoubtedly held in some quarters, and hasinfluenced the style of much contemporary legislation. In a recent case LordSimon of Glaisdale, supported by Lord Kilbrandon, repeated a suggestionhe had made in evidence to us that &quot;Where the promoter of a Bill, or a Minister supporting it, is askedwhether the statute has a specified operation in particular circumstances,and expresses an opinion, it might well be made a constitutional convention that such a contingency should ordinarily be the subject matter of specificstatutory enactment unless, indeed, it were too obvious to needexpression&quot;.If, as we recommend (paragraph 19.26), there is to be no change in the ruleabout the non-admissibility of Parliamentary proceedings for interpretation,such a convention might seem to be helpful to the courts; but it would at thesame time tend to add a further element of undesirable elaboration to the statutes. This effect could perhaps be mitigated, and the number of occasions on which the convention would operate be kept to the minimum, if more usewere made of examples showing how a Bill was intended to work in particularsituations, and if such examples were ordinarily set out in Schedules as werecommend, for matters of detail generally, in paragraph 10.13.10.8 These pressures for immediate certainty through detailed drafting arereinforced by the tradition of English law, which attaches relatively greatimportance to the common law as against statute law. It is a presumption that nothing but a precise and explicit statutory enactment can modify acommon-law concept. In Scotland the tradition is different and it may wellbe that the approach of the Scottish courts to the task of applying a broadlydrafted statutory provision would not be so strict. In their evidence to usLord Emslie and Lord Wheatley concurred in saying: &quot;So far as Scots judgesare concerned the strength of their common-law system lies in its relianceupon broad statements of principle, and there is no reason to suppose that similar broad statements of principle in statute law would not, in their hands,be applied to the facts of any given case [so as] to achieve the will of Parliament&quot;.But the modern statutory law of Scotland emanates from the same legislatureas does that of England and notwithstanding the difference of tradition thestyle is at present the same for both countries. In Chapter XIX we discuss further the effect on drafting style of the courts&apos; approach to the interpretation of statutes.The consequences of aiming for immediate certainty10.9 The striving after certainty often results in legislation which is complex and not readily intelligible, and obviously the objective of achieving immediatecertainty may conflict with the objectives of &quot;simplicity and clarity&quot; mentionedin our terms of reference. As we have indicated above, there are two features of the pursuit of immediate certainty, either of which may result in a lack ofsimplicity and clarity. One is the avoidance of ambiguity in what is stated:&quot;being unambiguous . . . is by no means the same as being readily intelligible;^Dockers&apos; Labour Club and Institute Ltd. v. Race Relations Board [1974] 3 W.L.R. 533,
on the contrary, the nearer you get to the one, the further you are likely toget from the other&quot;.1 The second feature is the attempt to ensure that what isstated is exhaustive. These two features can lead to statutes, and individualprovisions, of indigestible length and elaboration. If a less exacting standardof immediate certainty were accepted the draftsman would be free to draft ina more readable style.Conclusions on conflicting objectives10.10 The enactment of law in the form of general principles, however clearlyexpressed and apparently easy to comprehend, may prove deceptive when it comes to applying the statute to particular circumstances. Compare, for example,the Bankruptcy legislation of England with that of Germany. In England, wehave an exhaustive list of acts of bankruptcy. German law merely states thatif the debtor is insolvent or if the debts or liabilities exceed the assets certainthings can be done; insolvency is left to be defined by the courts. The Germanstatute law looks much simpler, but the lawyer who has to apply it must consult the case-law (although it is of persuasive but not binding force) in order tosee how the courts have interpreted &quot;insolvent&quot;. Where a statute has been inforce for some time, any gain in apparent clarity and simplicity in the statuteitself may be found merely to have shifted the complex task of ascertainingits precise effect, in a particular case, further into the area of case-law. Wherethe statute is a new one, there may be a period of greater uncertainty whilethe lines on which the principles stated in the statute should be applied arebeing settled by the courts, often at considerable personal expense to individuallitigants. As long ago as 1875 it was estimated that it had cost the country atleast  100,000 to ascertain the meaning of the Statute of Frauds.10.11 At the same time, too much weight should not be given to possibleuncertainty about the application of general principles to particular factualsituations: even where legislation is framed so as to deal with specific instances,as it generally is in this country at present, some situations are almost sure tobe overlooked, thus leaving an area of uncertainty, and it may be more difficult for the courts to decide how those situations should be dealt with than it wouldhave been if the legislation in question had been framed in broad terms withclear statements of the principles intended to apply. Also, we have no doubtthat British courts would have little difficulty with legislation framed in thelatter way, even if some modification of the traditional approach to inter-pretation were necessary. However, it could well be that any substantialalteration of the balance between the function of law-making on the one handand that of working out the application of the laws on the other hand wouldbe unacceptable to Parliament and possibly to public opinion.10.12 As we have pointed out in paragraphs 10.4 to 10.6, there are demands for immediate certainty in legislation from the Government, who want to besure that the Bill gives complete and predictable effect to policy; also from parliament, particularly where the Bill intervenes in private life or in business,and broad propositions may be seen as oppressive. We think these demandshave often been more insistent than was necessary. Legislating by statement ofgeneral principle may however be more acceptable for private law governing1 Sir Ernest Gowers, The Complete Plain Words (Penguin Books, 1968), pp 18-19.59
the dealings of individuals and non-State corporations one with another,than for public law sanctioning fiscal1 or other intervention by the State inthose dealings or governing relations between the State and its individual orcorporate subjects. Law Reform Bills offer scope for the method of draftingwhich relies on simple statements of principle, and this is apparent in thedraft Bills which the Law Commissions produce.10.13 The adoption of the &quot;general principle&apos; approach in the drafting of ourstatutes would lead to greater simplicity and clarity. We would, therefore, liketo see it adopted wherever possible. We accept, however, that this approach toa large extent sacrifices immediate though not eventual certainty and placesupon the courts a heavier responsibility in identifying the intention of thelegislature when applying legislation to particular circumstances. We recognisethat this is unlikely to be acceptable to the executive and the legislature incertain types of legislation, particulary fiscal and other public law which definesthe rights and obligations of individuals in relation to the State, and we considerthat it would in any event be unreasonable to draft in principles so broad thatthe effect of the statute could not be assessed without incurring the expense oflitigation to determine an issue. But we recommend that encouragement shouldbe given to the use of statements of principle, that is to say, the formulation of broad general rules, whether or not the subject matter of the Bill is con-sidered by the Government to call in addition for detailed legislative guidance,through one method or another (see paragraphs 6.7, 6.8). Where such detailedguidance is required in the Bill it should be contained in Schedules, and themain body of the statute should be confined to statements of its principles.This would enable those concerned primarily with principle to find it set outuncluttered by the details of its application and qualifications.vJThe implications of both methods of drafting in fiscal legislation are discussed in chapter XVII.
Chapter XIDRAFTING TECHNIQUES11.1 Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, in the preface to his lectures On the Art ofWriting,1 said: &quot;Literature is not a mere Science, to be studied; but an Art, tobe practised&quot;. This is true also of legislative drafting. Each draftsman is askilled professional lawyer with a style of his own, and once he is beyondthe apprentice stage he must act on his own responsibility. That does not mean,however, that he should ignore either the traditions and practice of the office or suggestions made by the consumers of his products. It is in that spirit thatwe consider in this chapter various techniques which we think can often^ in suitable contexts, make for improved readability.SIMPLICITY OF STYLE11.2 The most important technique, if the least tangible, is simplicity ofvocabulary and syntax. Varying degrees of emphasis have been placed bywitnesses on the need for this. Lord Simon of Glaisdale formulated the ideal inthe following terms: &quot;Desirably the language of legislation should be as near to ordinary speech as precision permits&quot;. But he recognised that &quot;most ordinaryterminology contains ambiguity&quot;. Another formulation (by Mr Ian PercivalQC MP) is that &quot;wherever possible, what is intended should be set out in the simplest terms, in the language nearest to that which would be used by those affected by it&quot;. The Statute Law Society suggest that &quot;clarity of expression, ofgrammar and construction should be a primary consideration&quot;. According tothe Faculty of Advocates &quot;The solution here must ... lie in a compromise between the precision of technical language and the ready comprehensibilityof the ordinary use of words ... The words used should be reasonably simple ...the sentences should be reasonably short&quot;. A number of other witnesses haveexpressed a preference for simpler language than is to be found in most statutesat present. Many witnesses recognise, however, that it may be difficult or evenimpracticable to achieve it in some kinds of legislation, notably in fiscalstatutes.11.3 In paragraphs 6.3 and 6.4 we quoted criticisms of current drafting styleby the Statute Law Society and other witnesses, and referred to the examplesin Appendix B of particular statutory provisions that had caused difficulties of interpretation in the courts. On the other side of the scales should be placed thefollowing tribute by Professor Driedger:&quot;With a new British statute, where I understand the subject matter andthe social background, I really have no problems and no difficulty inreading and understanding the statute. Of course, if it is a statute dealingwith your building societies, or your rent regulations, I would not under-stand it because I do not understand your practices, but an ordinary1 Cambridge University Press, 1916.
statute that deals with a familiar subject, or with a legal subject, I reallyhave no difficulty in understanding. I think on the whole they are wellwritten and well organised, and can be understood by anyone who isfamiliar with the subject matter of the statute and the circumstances thatgave rise to it&quot;.We would, moreover, mention here that Parliament does not always takekindly to the homely phrase. In a recent Bill the expression &quot;the owner hastried his best to let the building&quot; was not well received in the House of Commons,which preferred the more orotund &quot;used his best endeavours&quot;.11.4 In the 1940s and 1950s, when those who are now senior draftsmen werelearning the craft, there was still a general belief that the language, or rather the style, must be formalised, on mere grounds of decorum; and that theprecision needed to attain immediate certainty overrode every other considera-tion. In both respects the belief has since weakened. Language is increasinglyinformal. As to certainty, the need for it remains amply recognised (as it mustbe); but certainty is obtainable at two different levels. One is where the drafts-man deliberately words Ms clause so that at no point can it possibly be challenged for ambiguity, even by a reader (or legal practitioner) so perverse,or having such a professional interest in finding a way round the law, that heis resolved to find an ambiguity which to any ordinary reader is invisible. Atthis level of certainty, language becomes by gradations more and moreconvoluted, and the legislative proposition obscured. At the other level,sufficient certainty is obtained for a fair-minded and reasonable reader to bein no doubt what is intended, it being assumed that no one would take entirelyperverse points against the draft, or that such points v/ould be brushed asideby the court. Most of us are satisfied that there has been a substantial and desirable retreat from the first level, with resultant simplification andabbreviation of language.11.5 On the other hand, the draftsman must never be forced to sacrificecertainty for simplicity, since the result may be to frustrate the legislativeintention. An unfortunate subject may be driven to litigation because themeaning of an Act was obscure which could, by the use of a few extra words,have been made plain. The courts may hold, or a Government department be driven to conclude, that the Act which was intended to mean one thing doesnot mean that thing, but something else. Where this occurs, the draftsman&apos;sdiscomfort is considerable, and he will instinctively guard against its happeningto him a second time.AIDS TO UNDERSTANDINGStatements of purpose11.6 A number of witnesses have suggested to us that express statements of purpose would help to explain and clarify both complex legislative provisions which provide in detail for specific instances and legislation framed in termsof general principles. Statements of this kind can take various forms, such as1 HC Deb, 867, cc 1545, 1551, 1573.
a general preamble to an Act, a general statement of its purpose in one of theopening sections of an Act, or specific statements of purpose and preamblesprefacing particular sections or groups of sections or Parts of an Act.11.7 Among the advocates of statements of purpose are those whose taskit is to pronounce or advise on the effects of legislation: members of the judiciary, practising lawyers, and teachers of law. The draftsmen themselves are less enthusiastic. First Parliamentary Counsel takes the view that &quot;inmany cases the aims in the legislation cannot usefully or safely be summarisedor condensed&quot;, and that &quot;there may be a temptation to call for something which is no more than a manifesto, and which may obscure what is otherwiseprecise and exact&quot;. He also points out that &quot;detailed amendments to a Billafter introduction may not merely falsify the accompanying proposition but may even make it impracticable to retain any broad proposition&quot;. TheParliamentary Draftsman for Scotland adopts the same view: apart from certain special circumstances, he says &quot;the Act should in general explainitself&quot;. New Zealand&apos;s Chief Parliamentary Counsel told us that preambleswere rare in public Acts in New Zealand; purpose clauses, forming part ofthe text of the Act, were sometimes used, but were not thought to aid compre-hension. Professor Reed Dickerson thinks that &quot;most purpose clauses are quite unnecessary&quot;; that general purpose clauses tend to &quot;degenerate intopious incantations . . . such as . . . the one in a recent ecology Bill, which in substance said &apos;Hurray for Nature!&apos;&quot;; but that &quot;in prefatory language in individual sentences such as Tor the purpose of this&apos;, or Tor the purpose ofthat&apos;, or Tn order to do this&apos;, you may have an economic, focussed purposestatement that is of some use&quot;.11.8 We agree that statements of purpose can be useful, both at the Parlia-mentary stage and thereafter, for the better understanding of the legislativeintention and for the resolution of doubts and ambiguities. A distinction should, however, be drawn between a statement of purpose which is designedto delimit and illuminate the legal effects of the Bill and a statement of purposewhich is a mere manifesto. Statements of purpose of the latter kind should inour view be firmly discouraged. We think that statements of purpose in preamblesare particularly vulnerable to the &quot;manifesto&quot; type of drafting, and we shouldnot like to see a reversion to the archaic use of preambles as a means of declaringor justifying the objectives of public Bills. The preamble can be valuable as a means of reciting facts, such as the terms of a relevant treaty. But when a general statement of purpose is appropriate, we think it should be contained in a clause in the Bill. This has advantages at the Parliamentary stage, since a purpose clause can be amended (or omitted) exactly like any other clause.Preambles are subject to special rules. For the reasons we have given, we thinkthat purpose clauses can be helpful, but that they should be used selectively andwith caution. We refer in paragraph 19.39 below to one particular class oflegislation in which we recommend that statements of purpose should be generally used. Apart from that, we recommend:(a) that statements of purpose should be used when they are the most convenient method of delimiting or otherwise clarifying the scope and effect of legislation;(b) that when a statement of purpose is so used, it should be containedin a clause in the Bill and not in a preamble.
PresentationLength of sentences11.9 Several of our witnesses have suggested that a legislative statement in theform of a long sentence with a number of subordinate clauses is more difficultto understand than the same thought expressed in a number of short sentences.First Parliamentary Counsel tells us that the draftsmen in his office aim atkeeping sentences short and avoiding dense blocks of type. He points out,however, that there is bound to be some price to pay: there may have to bemore cross-references, and sections may come out longer, or with more sub-sections. He regards it as too soon to say whether the experiment will be a success. Sir John Fiennes, his predecessor, also sounds a note of caution:&quot;Shorter sentences are easier in themselves, and it would probably help overallto have them shorter, but of course you are then faced with having to find the relationship between that sentence and another sentence two sentences away,which, if you have it all in one sentence, is really done for you by the draftsman&quot;.11.10 We think it would be unwise to lay down any general rule about draftingin short sentences, or to suggest that draftsmen should impose limits of lengthon themselves. We would, however, emphasise the desirability of reducing to aminimum the number of subordinate phrases having to be read before thegrammatical subject of a sentence is reached or intervening between the subject and its attendant verb, at any rate where the sentence is not &quot;paragraphed&quot;(see paragraph 11.12).11.11 In current drafting practice a subsection, or a section that does not contain subsections, is usually punctuated as a single sentence; or, to put itin another way, every time a full stop is reached a new numbered provision isbegun.1 We think this is generally sound: where a thought has come to an end as is normally the case at the end of a sentence it is better to emphasise the break in this way. There may however be instances where the thoughts in twoor more grammatical sentences are so closely linked that it would be wrong toarrange the sentences as separate numbered provisions. Where that is so itmay often be better to join the sentences by a co-ordinating conjunction,,(preceded by a semicolon), thus emphasising the link (and in some casesavoiding repetition), than to separate them by a full stop. We recognise never-theless that there are cases where it is natural for a full stop to occur in themiddle of a numbered provision, and we do not think there should be any ruleor convention precluding this.&quot;Paragraphing&apos;&quot; of sentences11.12 We agree with the general consensus among our witnesses that denseblocks of type are extremely indigestible and should be avoided. Whilst we see no fundamental objection to longish sentences as such, we think that where oneoccurs it should be visually broken up into inset &quot;paragraphs&quot; and (if necessary)&quot;sub-paragraphs&quot;, each labelled with its own letter or number, so as to bring out the grammatical structure of the sentence. The technique (termedAlthough there was a period when the internal full stop was fairly common (there are, forinstance, a number of occurrences in the Sale of Goods Act 1893), it now hardly occurs except where (as in section 236(9) of the Local Government Act 1972) it precedes a new butunnumbered paragraph.
&quot;paragraphing&quot; by Professor Driedger and &quot;tabulation&quot; by Professor ReedDickerson) may be illustrated by an example. The following (section 38(2) ofthe Finance Act 1974) was criticised in a London evening paper as &quot;one example of the grotesque language used by the Treasury draughtsmen&quot;:&quot;Where a gain accrues to a person on a disposal of an interest in land to which this section applies, so much (if any) of the gain as by virtue ofthis Chapter is a development gain shall be treated for all the purposesof the Tax Acts as income arising at the time of the disposal and as constituting profits or gains chargeable to tax under Case VI of Schedule Dfor the chargeable period in which the disposal is made, and (except forthe purpose of computing the development gain, if any, accruing in respectof the disposal) shall not be a chargeable gain&quot;.We think this sentence is easier to grasp if set out (with no alteration in wording,but one slight alteration in word order) in the following way:&quot;Where a gain accrues to a person on a disposal of an interest in land to which this section applies, so much (if any) of the gain as by virtue ofthis Chapter is a development gain:(a) shall be treated for all the purposes of the Tax Acts as incomearising at the time of the disposal and as constituting profits orgains chargeable to tax under Case VI of Schedule D for thechargeable period in which the disposal is made; and(b) shall not (except for the purpose of computing the developmentgain, if any, accruing in respect of the disposal) be a chargeablegain&quot;.Not surprisingly, it is still not possible to appreciate the effect of this provisionwithout some knowledge of the previous income tax and capital gains taxlegislation on which the section operates, and it is possible that some of the language used could have been simplified (though much of it may have beendictated by the previous legislation). But the gain in clarity from &quot;paragraphing&quot;alone seems to us to be considerable. This device is already used extensivelyby British Parliamentary draftsmen, and long blocks of unbroken type arenow unusual. Unusual though they are, however, they do occur occasionallyand we think it worth emphasising that they should be avoided.Arrangement generally11.13 As Professor Driedger said to us, &quot;A draftsman can contribute agreat deal to comprehensibility by arranging the provisions of a statute logicallyand orderly, dividing it into parts in some cases and inserting headings, sub-headings and marginal notes ... as guide-posts. If a statute is carefully arrangedand if these visual aids are supplied, then a reader, by scanning the statute,can at first glance get a fairly good idea of what the subject matter is, and whatthe scope of the Act is&quot;. This seems to us unexceptionable as a generalproposition; we would only emphasise that in deciding on the arrangementthe draftsman ought to have the convenience of the ultimate users constantlyin mind. The logical arrangement of Acts is sometimes impeded by Parliamentaryconsiderations, which we discuss in Chapter XVHI. In the following paragraphs (11.14 to 11.25) we look at some particular aspects of arrangement and presentation.
Position of extent, interpretation, and similar provisions11.14 Lord Thring regarded the logical place for these formal and recurringprovisions (known as &quot;common-form clauses&quot;) as being together, and at thebeginning of the Act &quot;as the reader cannot understand the Act till he is master of the definitions or explanations of the terms used in the Act&quot;.1 Later writersbroadly agree.2 Parliamentary requirements, however, are said to dictate thatthese provisions should come at the end of the Bill &quot;as a definition frequentlynarrows or widens the whole scope of an Act, and Parliament cannot possiblyjudge whether such narrowing or widening is expedient till they are acquainted with the Act itself&quot;.3 We consider this question in Chapter XVIII.Definitions11.15 Conflicting views have been expressed to us about the use of definitions.Some witnesses have complained that there are not enough definitions, and therehave been objections to definitions that are not exhaustive but merely &quot;include&quot;specified things in the defined expression. Others, including Professor ReedDickerson, think that definitions should be used sparingly, and that the&quot;includes&quot; form is often preferable: &quot;Occasionally you need a full-blowndefinition, but most of the time definitions need only to stipulate meaning in thearea of marginal uncertainty&quot;. Professor Driedger advocates the use of defini-tions not only for extending or fixing the boundaries of meaning but also as adrafting technique to remove descriptive material from the body of a sentence,and thus leave the main sentence in a simpler form. We agree with him, but thinkthat these matters must be left to the judgement of the draftsman.11.16 A common complaint is that expressions are often defined by referenceto other statutes. Professor Reed Dickerson recommends &quot;either saying nothingor repeating the specific language you need&quot;. Both these alternatives should beconsidered by the draftsman, but there are occasions when the need for certaintyweighs against the first and the need for brevity weighs against the second. Insuch cases the definition of an expression by reference to another statutewill often be justifiable, especially when the other statute enacts a general codeor is otherwise well-known. On the other hand, the definition of an expressionby reference to another statute which is obscure or obsolescent should so faras possible be avoided.11.17 Although it is usual to gather the definitions used in a statute into one section which appears at the end with the other common-form provisions,some definitions occur in closer proximity to the provisions to which theyprimarily refer. It may be inconvenient to users that all definitions used in a statute are not to be found in one place; but we accept that occasions arise in large and complex Bills where it is for the convenience of the user if definitionsare placed in those Parts of a Bill to which they relate. It would not always be helpful to the user to suggest that there should be a firm rule which laid down that all definitions should be gathered into one section; and the draftsman mustbe allowed the discretion of deciding where particular definitions are to be practical Legislation (1902), pp 96-97.2Driedger, Composition of Legislation, p 106; Dickerson, Legislative Drafting, p 56; Thornton,Legislative Drafting, pp 130-133.^Practical Legislation (1902), pp 96-97.
placed. In current practice, if all the definitions are not set out in one inter-pretation section at the end of the Act the outlying ones are usually indexed inthe interpretation section. In a lengthy Act the practice is the same exceptthat each Part may be treated like a separate Act. In the exceptional case of theReservoirs Bill of 1974, where all the definitions are outlying ones, tabulatedindexing in a Schedule was adopted as the most convenient arrangement forthe reader. We recommend that, except in very short Acts, definitions occurringin the body of the Act should always be indexed in one or another of these ways.11.18 It has been suggested to us by a number of witnesses that expressionsdefined in an Act should be printed in italics or some other distinctive typewherever they occur in the text of the Act. First Parliamentary Counsel hasreservations about this: he thinks that special type might merely be a distraction,particularly if several kinds of type were used for this and other purposes. we agree, but consider that the possibility of signalling a definition by some other means (such as a marginal reference to the defining provision) should be explored. We revert to this in paragraph 11.21 below.Internal cross-references11.19 We agree with a number of witnesses that these should take the form ofprecise references to numbered provisions, as they normally now do, and thatit is often helpful if, in big Acts, they include a short parenthetical description of the subject-matter of the provision referred to, as is done when makingexternal references to other legislation.Mathematical formulae11.20 We welcome the increased use of fractions and other formulae where this enables the draftsman to avoid a verbal description necessarily compli-cated of a mathematical process, provided the formulae are simple ones that can be readily understood by people who are not expert mathematicians. the attractions of the technique ought not to be allowed to lead to the use of elaboratemathematical forms of expression, which might do more harm than good.Typography11.21 We have already discussed (in paragraph 11.18) one suggestion for theuse of special type. It has also been suggested to us that a distinctive type shouldbe used to indicate amendments where amended provisions are recapitulated inan amending Act, and (by the House of Lords Select Committee on procedures for Scrutiny of Proposals for European Instruments, in their Second report)that those portions of ordinary departmental Bills that propose to translateCommunity law into United Kingdom law, and the corresponding portions ofthe resulting Acts, should be printed in such a way that they are easily recognis-able. Without having made a careful technical analysis, we agree with first parliamentary Counsel that the cumulative effect of a number of different typesused for different distinguishing purposes could be distracting and confusing.We agree with the Select Committee&apos;s suggestions about European Communityprovisions, but we think that some other convention (possibly footnotes ormarginal symbols) may be preferable for distinguishing passages of other1 HL 194, 1972-73, paragraph 116.
kinds. We recommend that the Statute Law Committee should consider whatvisual aids and pointers could be helpful in the light of available type faces,page space and technology generally.11.22 First Parliamentary Counsel has drawn our attention to the sizes oftype in which Acts and their Schedules are printed and we have considered whether any change would contribute to the convenience of users. We considerthat the type at present used in the Schedules is inconveniently small and recommend the use of a larger one.Amendment Schedules11.23 A Schedule of amendments is normally set out as a series of paragraphs.The advantages claimed for this form, as compared to a Schedule in the tabularform used for repeals, are that it takes up less space, and is more flexible andlends itself more readily to special cases such as amendments that insertwhole new sections into existing Acts. We think that amendment Schedulesin tabular form would, nevertheless, often be clearer from the user&apos;s point ofview and would make the mechanical job of noting-up the amendments easier.Whilst we do not suggest that there should be any inflexible rule, we recommendthat the practice should be to set out amendment Schedules in tabular formunless there were strong reasons for not doing so in a particular case.Shoulder notes11.24 Where an Act is divided into Parts, each page of a Queen&apos;s Printerscopy of the Act, and of the Act as printed in Public General Acts and Measures,at present carries a shoulder note showing the number of the Part in whichthe text on that page is contained. Where Parts are subdivided into Chapters,the shoulder note also gives the Chapter number. In neither case, however,do the shoulder notes include section numbers; and where the Act is notdivided into Parts there are no shoulder notes at all. We think it would bea small but valuable aid to users if Queen&apos;s Printers copies of all Acts, andPublic General Acts and Measures, were to carry on each page a shoulder noteshowing section and, where applicable, Part and Chapter numbers, on thelines of those to be found in Statutes in Force and The Taxes Acts; and werecommend accordingly.Detail11.25 We have concluded in paragraph 10.13 that encouragement should begiven to the use of broad statements of principle wherever possible. we recognise, however, that much legislation will continue to include a good dealof detail. It is already the practice for much of this to be relegated to Schedulesand to subordinate legislation, thus simplifying the substantive sections of theAct. There is a wide range of opinion among our witnesses about the ways inwhich such material should be distributed between sections, Schedules, andsubordinate legislation. We agree with the view expressed by the Law Societyto the Select Committee on Procedure,1 and repeated to us, that:&quot;it is desirable to cut down the amount of detail at present contained inBills . . . But where a considerable volume of detail is essential to the1 HC 538, 1970-71, Appendix C, paragraphs 11 and 12.68
legislation we think that so far as possible this should be contained inSchedules to the Bill rather than in separate statutory instruments, as this makes the statutory provisions more easily accessible as a whole . . .the body of the Bill itself should contain the general principles set out asclearly and simply as possible; detailed provisions of a permanent kind should be contained in Schedules to the Bill; and only details which may require comparatively frequent modification should be delegated to statutory instruments&quot;.MODEL PROVISIONS11.26 We mentioned in Chapter II (paragraph 2.13) the suggestion by a SelectCommittee in 1875 that model clauses might be prescribed for general use.Our attention has also been drawn to the Second Report from the JointCommittee on Delegated Legislation (Session 1972-73),1 which recommends(paragraph 26) that standard formulae should be enacted for the two mostcommon types of statutory provision conferring power to act by way ofaffirmative instrument. Paragraph 23 of the Joint Committee&apos;s Report statesthat &quot;There is a particularly strong case for a standard provision to be attracted by a specific short formulae in parent Acts, in respect of&quot; statutory instruments which expire after a certain period unless approved within thatperiod. We think it right to draw attention in this chapter to the JointCommittee&apos;s recommendation.LEGISLATION BY REFERENCE11.27 Our witnesses have been almost unanimous in condemning &quot;legislation by reference&quot;, or &quot;referential legislation&quot;, as a source of confusion andirritation both to legislators and to other users. They have not always, however,been very clear about what they mean by those terms.11.28 Sir William Graham-Harrison, in an address delivered in 1935 to theSociety of Public Teachers of Law,2 quoted Sir Courtenay Ilbert as saying:&quot;Legislation is obviously referential in the widest sense. No statute is completely intelligible as an isolated enactment. Every statute is a chapter,or fragment of a chapter, of a body of law. It involves reference, expressor implied, to the rules of common law, or to the provisions of otherstatutes on the same subject&quot;.Sir William went on to classify legislation by reference as follows:&quot;(1) Enactments which(a) apply to a new set of circumstances law originally passed fordealing with another set of circumstances, or(b) apply to some matter a code originally passed for the purpose ofbeing applied from time to time to that kind of matter.(2) Enactments which affect an existing enactment in any way, whetherby modifying it or continuing it in force, or by getting rid of italtogether.1 HL 204, HC 468.2 Printed in the Journal of that Society for 1935 at pages 9 to 45.
(3) Enactments containing descriptive references, such as &apos;a companywithin the meaning of the Companies Acts&apos; &quot;.11.29 Of these, we regard class 1(b) as entirely unobjectionable, at any ratewhere the code is applied without modification. Where there are modifications of the code as applied to the particular matter, the clarity of the result maydepend on the technique by which they are effected.11.30 We have already touched on class (3) in paragraph 11.16, but it coversmore than mere definitions (eg &quot; &apos;act of bankruptcy&apos; has the same meaning asin the Bankruptcy Act 1914 It covers every case where the situation to bedealt with by a new enactment is created or circumscribed by an earlier one(eg &quot;A purchaser shall not be prejudicially affected by notice of any instrument or matter capable of registration under the provisions of the Land ChargesAct 1925 &quot;2). We do not think that this class of legislation by reference can be dispensed with. We recommend, however, that it should not be used when thematter which is being referred to can simply and shortly be incorporated in the later Act.11.31 Section 6(1) of the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1944is an example of class 1(a). It reads as follows:&quot;The improvement of Live Stock (Licensing of Bulls) Act 1931 shall. . .apply to pigs as it applies to cattle, and for that purpose references therein[to various matters shall be construed as references to other matters]&quot;.The broad distinction between class (l)(a) and class (2) is obvious, though thereis an area where the two classes overlap. Legislation in class (l)(a) is oftenobjectionable, particularly where the previous Act or Acts applied are notspecified (as in section 8(1) of the Finance Act 1894). Most of the controversyabout class (2) concerns the methods (textual and non-textual) by whichamendments are made to existing enactments. To this topic we devote a separatechapter (Chapter XIII).1 Law of Property Act 1925, section 110(2).2 Law of Property Act 1925, section 199(1).
Chapter XIIANGLO-SCOTTISH LEGISLATIONINTRODUCTION12.1 Parliament frequently legislates in a single Act for the whole of GreatBritain. In such a case, the initial draft of the Bill is prepared by parliamentary counsel (who is of course not a Scottish lawyer)1 to fit into the framework of English law, and then passed to a Scottish draftsman who adapts it to scottish law. England and Scotland have separate legal systems with differentbackgrounds, and so this way of producing legislation may cause difficulties of presentation that interfere with its clarity and simplicity, particularly for theScottish practitioner. The technique has been tersely described by the lateLord Cooper of Culross (Lord President of the Court of Session from 1947to 1954) as:&quot;... the legislative practice adopted at Westminster through pressure of work whereby statutes are normally drafted by English lawyers for england, and then applied with the minimum of &quot;adaptation&quot; to Scotland,the tacit assumption being that whatever England wants must be goodenough for Scotland, and that statutes should also conform as closely as possible to a uniform pattern, capable of being understood and appliedfrom London by one set of officials&quot;.Lord Cooper continued:&quot;In the purely administrative and governmental sphere this legislativetechnique is an intelligible consequence of the political Union betweenthe two countries, and often does no harm. But in the last fifty years the statute book will reveal not a few instances of the forcible compressionof Scottish legal principles into English moulds without much regard for the resulting strains and distortions. Every translator knows that there are manyterms in one language which have no exact equivalent in another; and what is true of language is also true of law&quot;.2The Law Society of Scotland have drawn our attention to the evidence theysubmitted to the Kilbrandon Commission on the Constitution3 in which,referring to the conflation required to construe a passage along with its relatedScottish application clause, they said:&quot;Whereas an English practitioner has a clear run-through of the legisla-tion, the Scottish practitioner has to engage in a most time-consumingand frustrating process of elimination and amendment before he can make sense of the new legislation&quot;.Evidence to like effect was given to the Kilbrandon Commission by the Facultyof Advocates, and from our own general knowledge we are aware that these*At present one of the Parliamentary Counsel happens to be a member of the Scottish Baras well as of the English Bar; but this is not a required qualification.*The Scottish Legal Tradition (1949).Commission on the Constitution, Written Evidence, Vol 5, Scotland (HMSO, 1972),p 15.
criticisms reflect complaints which have been voiced from time to time bymost users of the Scottish statutes. The Chairman of the Scottish Law Commis-sion, Lord Hunter, has recently1 stressed that the Scottish content of UnitedKingdom legislation is just as much the law of Scotland as any other statutoryconstituent of Scots law, and has pointed out that some large Whitehall depart-ments are not sufficiently equipped to ensure that legislation affecting scotland for which they are responsible takes account of this. We have therefore con-sidered the system of drafting this type of legislation and we suggest a numberof changes which, in our view, would lessen the incidence of resulting difficultyfor the Scottish user. The objective should be a technique of preparation of thoseBills which will secure for Scotland as well as for England and Wales observance of the fundamental principle that legislation ought to be so framed as to fitharmoniously into the legal background into which it is to be incorporated.THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF DRAFTING OF ANGLO-SCOTTISHBILLS12.2 The instructions for the drafting of a Bill which is to apply to scotland as well as to England and Wales are prepared by the department promoting the Bill, or if the Bill deals with a subject, for example agriculture, for whichthere are separate English and Scottish departments, by these two departments in co-operation. Sometimes a Great Britain department has no Scottish legal adviser to assist in the preparation of instructions to draft. In such cases it is unlikely that the instructions will take account of any difficulties peculiar tothe Scottish legal system, so that the framework of the draft Bill based on these instructions may be inappropriate in a Scottish context and may make a scottish adaptation more awkward than it need be. It is much more difficultto alter the framework of a Bill at a later stage than to produce a satisfactorydraft in the first place, especially when there is great pressure on time. GreatBritain departments contemplating the preparation of an Anglo-Scottish Billshould therefore have available a Scottish legal adviser, specialising in thedepartments field, to work closely with his English counterpart in thepreparation of instructions for the draftsman and at all subsequent stages.12.3 Whatever the source of the instructions, it is important that the Scottishdraftsman, even though he will not be producing the first draft of the Bill,should see them as soon as they are ready, so that he can study the proposals and background material and identify at an early stage any points of particularrelevance to Scotland. A copy of the instructions is therefore sent to the first parliamentary Draftsman for Scotland as well as to First parliamentary counsel. On receipt of the instructions the Parliamentary Counsel proceeds,usually without previous discussion with the Scottish draftsman, to get out a first draft of the Bill as a measure suitable to apply in England and Wales.When he has completed this first draft, he sends copies to his Scottish counter-part, and there then begins a process of consultation and interchange of draftsbetween the two with the object of adapting the original draft to make itworkable for Scotland without creating difficulties for England and Wales.12.4 Apart from studying the instructions and drafting any provisions forpurposes peculiar to Scotland, there is nothing the Scottish draftsman can dounder this system until he receives a copy of the English draft. He often inxThe Scotsman, 3 March 1975, p 5.
practice has to work within restraints imposed not only by shortage of timebut also by the English framework in which the Bill has taken shape, and sometimes also by politically imposed limitations upon the number of clausesallowed. The First Parliamentary Draftsman for Scotland has described thesituation as follows:&quot;The Scottish draftsman . . . must work as it were within an Englishframework. He has to wait for Parliamentary Counsel to issue a draftof the Bill before he can start to function, and there is naturally corres-correspondingly less time to sort out the necessary Scottish provisions. There isa further difficulty that when the draft Bill comes to the Scottish draftsmanhe is in a sense tied by the English draftsman&apos;s approach though it may not altogether suit the Scots&quot;.12.5 Where it is shown from the outset that a Bill is to extend to Scotland,the first draft will be prepared with that in mind. But this is not always the case.First Parliamentary Counsel, when discussing with us the consultation thattakes place between the Scottish and English draftsmen on a Bill, said:&quot;Sometimes the question has been put by a draftsman &apos;Will thisapply to Scotland?&apos; and the answer is &apos;We shall not know for anotherthree weeks&apos;. In such circumstances you cannot be scrupulous to take account of the Scottish interests&quot;.This seems to us to pin-point one of the underlying causes of the difficultiescomplained about.12.6 Even if it is arranged that the English and Scottish provisions will been acted in parallel in separate parts of the Bill, the Scottish draftsman may still run into difficulty. If he adopts a different approach in passages where this is not necessary for strictly technical reasons, he may encounter problems arising from the rule of interpretation that where Parliament, in one and thesame Act and in pari materia, uses different language it must generally be presumed to intend a different result.1 In the result he may be obliged to follow a text which in his own view could well be improved upon regardless of any difference between the two legal systems. To some extent the same applieswhen the whole Bill is to be enacted separately for Scotland.PROPOSED CHANGES12.7 We believe that there should be a change in the system whereby Anglo-Scottish legislation, where it is required to be contained in a combined Bill,is first designed for use in England and Wales and only then adapted forScotland. There is no constitutional reason for this arrangement, whatever may be the day-to-day pressures imposed by the requirements of the legislative programme. A bicycle intended to be ridden by two people ought to be designed as a tandem from the outset, and not as a solo to which a second seat will^This rule is, however, by no means universally applicable and is perhaps irrelevant whencomparing a Scottish provision with a corresponding English provision. Cf. dicta of Lord Reidin Watson v. Fram and Winget, 1960 SC(HL) 92 at 107, and of IDenning and Parker L.JJ. inJR. v. Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (ex parte Graham), [1955] 2 QB 140 at 162 and 168,and of Lord Reid in Central Asbestos Co. v. Dodd [1973] AC 518 at p 532C.
later be attached. As a first step towards an improvement, we recommendthat Great Britain departments sponsoring Anglo-Scottish Bills should issue instructions to both English and Scottish draftsmen in time to allow adequateconsultation between them to take place, and that as soon as they receivetheir instructions they should both begin to plan the Bill from the start inconsultation with each other. In this process neither draftsman should feelinhibited, either by fear of lengthening the Bill with apparent duplicationor by giving undue weight to the presumption above mentioned, from discardinga provision suggested by the other if it cannot be accommodated harmoniouslyto the legal system with which he is primarily concerned. We recommendtherefore that each should be free to produce corresponding but separateprovisions. A recent example of an Act in which this method has been followedwith successful results is the Domicile and Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1973.Where a minor variant as between England and Scotland occurs within a clause we recommend that the technique of using a Scottish substitution orother adpatation should be avoided; and instead the English and Scottishversions should be set out separately, as has been done for example insection 42(2) of the Fair Trading Act 1973.DECISIONS BETWEEN &quot;COMBINED&quot; FORM AND &quot;SEPARATE&quot;FORM OF ANGLO-SCOTTISH LEGISLATION12.8 The criticisms which we have mentioned in paragraph 12.1 do not applyto all Anglo-Scottish Acts, some of which involve little or no difference either in approach or technicalities between the two legal systems. Moreover, legisla-tion intended for both England and Scotland is sometimes enacted in the formof two parallel but separate Acts, and the choice of this method eliminatesmost of the drafting difficulty inherent in combined legislation. This is the form which in our view should be preferred whenever a combined Bill cannot be drafted for both countries without complicated adaptation, and we recommendthat it should be regarded as the standard choice in such circumstances. Nodoubt the choice is often in fact determined by factors arising from the manage-ment in Parliament of the Governmenfs legislative programme; and indeedwe were informed by First Parliamentary Counsel that often enough adviceoffered by him against a combined Bill is rejected for political reasons. In ourview the choice should never be made in favour of a single combined Billwithout the advice of the English and Scottish draftsmen having been sought;nor, if such advice is against the use of the combined method, without properweight having been given to the probable result in terms of complexity andobscurity. We were told that at present advice on this question is not soughtsystematically, and we recommend that it should be.12.9 The enactment of separate Acts applying equally to England and wales and to Scotland need not take up as much Parliamentary time as would berequired under existing procedures. In paragraph 18.4 we outline a procedure for the enactment of separate parallel Acts which would in our view saveParliamentary time and make it easier for the Government not to legislate in the form of combined Anglo-Scottish Acts with the difficulties that thesesometimes cause. We recommend that the adoption of that procedure &quot;shouldbe considered.
RE-ENACTMENT OF SCOTTISH VERSIONS OF COMBINED ACTS12.10 There may on occasion be such urgency to enact a particular piece oflegislation, and such shortage of Parliamentary time, that it is necessary, inspite of the considerations which we have urged in the foregoing paragraphs,to instruct the draftsmen to prepare an Anglo-Scottish Bill which turns out torequire an unacceptable degree of alteration to make it suitable for Scotland.For such Bills, and we hope that they would be few, we recommend that a procedure should be adopted such as we describe in paragraph 18.5 whichwould permit the speedy re-enactment of a Scottish version.
Chapter XLTIAMENDING EXISTING LEGISLATION13.1 Few Bills are enacted which do not in some way refer to earlier legislation,and a great many of them amend existing Acts. The way in which such amend-ments are made has a bearing upon the ease with which the combined effectof the original and the amending legislation can be grasped. In this chapterwe examine the methods by which Acts are or could be amended and theirpossible effect on the resulting state of the law.13.2 In the United Kingdom, a common method of amending an Act hasbeen to enact in the amending Bill the substance of the change proposed tobe made without altering the text of the Act being amended. The amendinglaw does not become part of the previous statute, nor does it lose its separateidentity in the statute book. This method of legislative amendment we describeas &quot;non-textual amendment&quot;. It is less usual in English speaking countries outside the United Kingdom. Commonwealth countries and the United Statesprefer to amend their legislation by expressing amendments in the same way as corrigenda or addenda in books, that is in the form of directions to strikeout particular words or sentences from an enactment, and to add others. this method we describe as &quot;textual amendment&quot;. The expression &quot;legislation by reference&quot; is often used as if it meant exactly the same as non-textual amend-ment, but strictly speaking it includes both non-textual and textual amendment.Whichever method of amendment is chosen by the draftsman, some incon-venience for the reader of the statute is inevitable.13.3 A fairly simple example of an identical amendment drafted both non-textually and textually may be found in the Town and Country Planning Act1968. Section 149 of the principal Act, the Town and Country Planning Act1962, is amended non-textually by section 37(3) of the 1968 Act which reads as follows:&quot;For a person to be treated under section 149(1) or (3) of the principalAct (definitions for purposes of blight notice provisions) as owner-occupieror resident owner-occupier of a hereditament, his occupation thereof at arelevant time or during a relevant period, if not occupation of the wholeof the hereditament, must be, or, as the case may be, have been occupationof a substantial part of it&quot;.A corresponding textual amendment of section 149 of the principal Act is effected by section 38 of the 1968 Act (with Schedule 4):&quot;Section 149In subsections (l)(a), (1)(6), (3)(a) and (3)(b), for the words &apos;the wholeor part&apos; (wherever occurring) there shall be substituted the words&apos;the whole or a substantial part&apos; &quot;.
13.4 Whether an Act is amended non-textually or textually, the reader mustacquaint himself with the provisions both of the original Act and the amendingAct until he is provided with a consolidation of the statute law on the subject in question. We use the word &quot;conflation&quot; to describe this process of readingrelated enactments together. The conflation of several enactments by the userof the statutes may be inconvenient, indeed difficult, for him. The draftsmanand Parliament must therefore have regard to the way that the statute lawon any subject will appear once the amending legislation they are preparingand passing has been added to the statute book. It may be that a provisionoperating upon an earlier Act is reasonably clear as it stands, but the merefact that the existing Act has to be read in conjunction with a later measureis at the least bothersome, and may at times cause great difficulty. There musthowever inevitably be a certain amount of cross-reference between Acts. Whenthe draftsman gets down to the actual wording of new legislation he is facedwith the problem of how to handle this cross-reference, bearing in mind themore immediate but transient needs of the legislator and others concernedwith the Bill during its passage through Parliament, and the long-termpermanent needs of the ultimate user.13.5 So far as the legislator is concerned, the draftsman will want to give him,in brief compass, an accurate account of how the proposed legislation will affect existing Acts. He can do this by providing a succinct summary, or bywriting out in precise terms the changes in existing legislation that are proposed.Clearly the choice will depend to some degree on the subject matter. The ulti-mate user, on the other hand, may be less concerned to be given a descriptivesummary of the effect of the proposed legislation on existing enactments.His purpose may frequently be better served by an Act which spells out exactly the changes to be made in the text of the existing legislation so that he can continue to use the existing Acts, thus amended, as authoritative expressions of the statute law on their particular subjects. In the following paragraphswe consider in more detail how far the differing needs of those concernedwith the Bill, and the ultimate user of the Act are respectively met by the two main methods of amendment.NON-TEXTUAL AMENDMENTNon-textual amendment and the needs of the legislator13.6 The Westminster tradition has been to draft measures that are as faras possible self-explanatory, so that Members of Parliament coming to a Billfor the first time can fairly quickly grasp the purpose of any new law theyare being asked to enact and any changes in the existing law that require their consent. The argument is that Members of Parliament and others concernedwith Bills are busy people, and it would be a misuse of their time to send themsearching to find out how a Bill before them affects existing legislation if this canbe indicated in the Bill itself. A distinguished Parliamentary draftsman, SirCourtenay Ilbert, expressed this point as follows:&quot;The ordinary method of amending an Act is to state in the amending bill the effects of the amendment proposed to be made. This is the commonest
mode, and for Parliamentary purposes the most convenient, because under it every Member of Parliament who knows anything of the subject, learnsat once the nature of the amendment proposed.113.7 From the point of view of the legislator, an amending clause in a Billdrafted in a narrative, non-textual style can often be better understood on itsown, and it is not difficult for Parliament to engage in a logical and orderlydebate about the issues raised by the proposal, whether this debate takes the form of a general discussion of the broad policy, as in a second reading debate, or a detailed scrutiny of particular points in committee. Anotheradvantage is the ease with which alterations to the clause can be proposedwhile it is passing through Parliament. An amendment to a Bill must take theform of a proposal either to insert certain words, or to leave out certain words,or to leave out certain words and substitute others. Proposed alterations toBills in effect take the form of textual amendments of those Bills, and it is acomparatively straightforward matter to draft and move such amendmentswhen the text of the Bill is reasonably self-contained.13.8 Mr Ian Percival QC MP was of the opinion that the present bias is too much in favour of non-textual amendment, though he was not preparedto go so far as to say that it should never be used. He was speaking not only as a legislator but also as a practising lawyer and a frequent user of the statutes.Lord Molson, who has wide experience of legislating, also expressed the opinionthat when amending existing legislation a statute should state its meaningclearly and not produce its intended effect by reference. It is our understandingthat Lord Molson would favour a greater use of the method of textual amend-ment of existing legislation.Non-textual amendment and the needs of the user13.9 Many users of the statutes have made it clear to us that the non-textualamendment of legislation gives rise to practical difficulties for them. Criticismhas come not only from the judiciary and some members of the legal profession,but from non-legal bodies as well. The Institute of Taxation, submittingevidence to us on the preparation of revenue legislation, pointed out that&quot;legislation by reference places a great and obvious burden on the practitioner&quot;,and went on to suggest that the draftsman of a Bill should as far as possibletry to reproduce the relevant passages from earlier statutes that have to be referred to in the Bill itself.13.10 We have already mentioned in paragraphs 6.15 and 6.16 the complaintswe have received about the excessive use of non-textual amendment and the inconvenience this causes to users of the statutes. On the other hand, we havereceived evidence from the General Council of the Bar in England and wales to the effect that:&quot;There is a substantial section of the Bar which would feel itself in sympathy with the criticisms made of the Statute Law Society&apos;s proposal that all the alterations to the law contained in an existing statute, particu-larly if it is a consolidation statute, should be effected by textual amend-ment of the existing statute and not by direct enactment of the intendedAlbert, Legislative Methods and Forms (Oxford 1901), p 259.
change. Certainly, if it is not possible to provide the textual memorandumproposed by the Society, direct enactment of the intended change is more readily assimilated by a lawyer with some knowledge of the existing law&quot;.The Law Society, representing the solicitors&apos; branch of the legal professionin England and Wales, in discussing the respective merits of the non-textualand textual systems of amending previous legislation said that:&quot;Our impression is that the textual system is now generally used where possible, but we think that there are clearly cases where it is not suitable.We would certainly not regard it as a panacea, as we think many of thedifficulties experienced by the Consumers&apos; of legislation have nothingwhatever to do with the question whether amendments are referentialor textual&quot;.The two corresponding Scottish bodies, the Faculty of Advocates and the law society of Scotland, expressed objections to the non-textual amendmentof previous legislation and supported the Statute Law Society.TEXTUAL AMENDMENT13.11 Legislation which amends earlier enactments by the textual methoddoes so by enacting the words that are to be inserted into or substituted for the text of the earlier Act. The example of a textual amendment we gave in paragraph13.3 demonstrates that neither the legislator nor the eventual user canform a very clear idea of the purpose of the provision at first sight. Before thereader can grasp this, he must go back to the original Act and dovetail into itthe new provisions now to become part of the law. This labour can of course bedone for him by an editor. The legislator can be provided with a &quot;textualmemorandum&quot; accompanying the Bill, or a Schedule, showing how the originalAct would read as amended, with the textual amendments indicated in adistinguishing type; and the user can be given a reprinted copy of the previousAct as amended.Textual amendment and the needs of the legislator13.12 Assuming that it is agreed that the textual method should be preferredfor the amendment of existing legislation, let us consider how far the practicewould meet the needs of the legislator. An amending Bill, or part of such aBill, drafted entirely as a collection of textual amendments to a parent Actwould, on its own, be largely unintelligible. It might therefore be necessary topresent the Bill to Parliament with an accompanying memorandum (a &quot;textualmemorandum&quot;) which would indicate the passages in the existing Act to be repealed and the additions and substitutions to be inserted, and thus show how the amended legislation would look if the proposals being considered byParliament were to be enacted. (An alternative to such a memorandum wouldbe the incorporation into the Bill of a &quot;Keeling Schedule&quot;, a device which we discuss in paragraphs 13.21 and 13.22). A complicated and lengthy Bill draftedentirely on the textual amendment system would need to be accompaniedby a textual memorandum. The legislator would therefore be presented with two documents, the Bill itself and a textual memorandum probably even longer than the Bill demonstrating the precise effect of the Bill on the existing legislation.
13.13 First Parliamentary Counsel has said that the work of producing sucha textual memorandum could represent a further burden on the team of officialshandling a Government Bill, and in particular on the Parliamentary draftsman.There are already heavy demands on the draftsman and we do not believe thathe should spend too much of his time preparing collateral explanatory material.The drafting of the Bill itself is of much greater importance and a draftsman willrarely have enough time to spend on that. With a large and complicated amending bill the draftsman would need to cope with the additional burden of preparingand amending a textual memorandum, and this should be an important consideration in deciding how far the use of textual amendment is practicable.Whatever assistance might be available to the draftsman, the final responsibilityfor the contents of the textual memorandum would have to remain with him.Private Members would also need to have assistance in the preparation oftextual memoranda to their Bills.13.14 Another matter of concern to Parliament is the ease with which amend-ments to Bills can be drafted and moved. It may be more difficult to draft an amendment to a proposal which is itself drawn in the form of a textual amend-ment than it is to draft an amendment to a provision whose purpose is reasonablyself-evident. Moreover, a Member of Parliament seeking to amend a Bill will want to see, and to let others see, what the precise effect of his amendmentswill be on the text both of the Bill and of the legislation to be amended. Where aBill drafted in the textual amendment style was acompanied by a textualmemorandum this could be done by re-writing the accompanying textualmemorandum, or part of it. But that would be a laborious matter if manyamendments were tabled, especially since only a small proportion of these amendments might be carried.Textual amendment and the needs of the user13.15 Does the textual amendment system help the user of the statutes by providing him with clearly stated, easily understood legislation ? The amendingAct, drafted textually, is by itself just as incomprehensible to the user as theBill originally was to the legislator. Certainly a diligent user with time availablecan make &quot;scissors and paste&quot; amendments of the parent Act using the textualdirections in the amending measure. But until he has done so (and the task would in some cases be laborious), or until the original Act has been reprinted asamended (either in Statutes in Force or otherwise), the user is faced withprecisely the same difficulty and inconvenience of constantly having to referfrom one Act to another about which there is presently so much complaint. the usefulness of the textual amendment system relies heavily on the systematicand prompt reproduction of edited versions of amended statutes. An importanttest therefore of the value to the user of textual amendment is whether it willbe possible to give him, fairly soon after the new provisions have become law,an edition of the amended code which will reflect the amendment in a handyform.13.16 Fortunately, an answer is provided in the new official revised editionof the statutes called Statutes in Force which is compiled on a loose-bookletsystem that not only allows newly enacted Acts to be inserted and repealedActs removed, but also enables an Act that has been amended to be replaced by a new booklet incorporating the amendments. The Edition is being published
by instalments, and editorial resources are at present concentrated upon thetask of getting the whole work out, but even now it is possible to bring out newrevised booklets where necessary. When the whole of the work has been published, it is hoped in about five years&apos; time, there will be ample resources toproduce revised booklets in all cases where it is thought desirable. To supplement the issue of revised booklets, there is an annual cumulative supplement for thoseActs that have been published in the Edition, giving details of all amendmentsthat have been made to those Acts since they were last published in the Edition.The amending Acts themselves are reprinted in skeleton form (the textualamendments having been carried into the parent Acts or into the annualsupplement), but any savings, transitional provisions and other matter that isstill in force are printed in full. With the publication of each new instalmentthe number of Acts reprinted increases, and it is thought that within two, or at the most three years from now, at least one-half of the total number of Actswill have been published in Statutes in Force.NON-TEXTUAL OR TEXTUAL AMENDMENT?13.17 In so far as there is a conflict between the respective needs of the legislatorand of the eventual user of the statutes, we have concluded that the needsof the user must be given priority when proposals for amending previouslegislation are being framed. Many statutes are already difficult enough tounderstand in themselves without making their sense even more abstruseby amending them in a manner which further perplexes the user. There is nodoubt that the non-textual amendment of existing legislation often adds to the burdens of the user, particularly when the consolidation of heavily amendedActs is held up for one reason or another. However, it is also clear that inpresent circumstances the adoption of a rule that amendments to existing legislation should always be made textually would create difficulties. Apartfrom the fact that there are many cases where the amendment of existing law canbe achieved more compendiously by non-textual amendment, the present state of the statute book is far from conducive to the exclusive practice oftextual amendment. An inflexible rule requiring this system always to beadopted would not be in the interests of the user, nor would it be workable forthe reasons we give in the following paragraph.13.18 One suggestion put to us was that there should be a new Standing Orderin both Houses of Parliament in the following terms:&quot;A Bill amending any enactment shall do so by directly altering itstext, unless this is impracticable&quot;.The point of such a Standing Order would be that a Bill containing unnecessarynon-textual amendments would be out of order, as would be any attemptto move an amendment to a Bill in a non-textual form, unless textual amendmentwere impracticable. A formidable difficulty in this proposal is that it offersno workable criterion of what is to be regarded as &quot;impracticable&quot;. Apartfrom that, we do not think that it would in practice be helpful. A rigid rulemight not be suitable for a number of reasons. It might be impossible to enforcebecause a Bill had to be prepared at great speed, or had to be kept short, or because urgency or other considerations made it impossible to provide thenecessary aids outside the text. A rigid practice might prevent the Government
from making a concession, perhaps at a late stage in a Bill, because an amend-ment to effect that concession would take that much longer to draft or to handlein the House. Moreover, there are cases where textual amendment would be useless or worse than useless; for example, transitional provisions and temporarylaws might not be readily susceptible of textual amendment. There will also becases where the same result could be achieved more compendiously by non-textual amendment. For example, an amendment operating in the same way in several different contexts may be much longer if it has to spell out the changes to be made in each context. We do not believe that a Standing Order whichcould have these results would commend itself, least of all to a Govern-ment committed to a heavy legislative programme. The risk that a Bill mightbe delayed or even lost would be unacceptable. Such an Order might also be unacceptable to the Members of each House, depending on how it was appliedto amendments to Bills and in particular unofficial amendments. At the least,much time and effort would be required to make the Order work, thus imposingan extra burden on Members, House officials and civil servants. For these reasons, we are unable to recommend that Parliament should consider makinga Standing Order on the lines proposed to us.13.19 Another problem, which has been mentioned in paragraph 13.14,is the difficulty of framing and moving amendments to Bills employing textualamendment; but Parliament as a whole is now more familiar with handlingamending legislation than it was, for example, when the 1875 Select committee reported, and we believe that Members of both Houses would be preparedto grapple with the possible difficulty of proposing amendments to Bills draftedon the textual amendment system, particularly when it is made clear to themthat such Bills are drafted in this way for the convenience of the ultimateuser.13.20 Having considered the problems on both sides of this question, we have concluded that the practice of using the textual method should be applied asgenerously as possible, and we so recommend. We are encouraged and pleased to hear that in fact the Parliamentary draftsmen, having regard to the needsof the user of the statutes, already make it a practice to amend legislationtextually wherever convenience permits. (The adoption of this practice was,we are told, partly prompted by the decision to publish Statutes in Forceand by the Law Commissions&apos; suggestion that the draftsmen should take account of the requirements of the new edition). We further recommend thatthe Editorial Board of Statutes in Force should be encouraged to reprintwithout delay loose copies of Acts as amended where this would be for the convenience of the users.THE KEELING SCHEDULE13.21 In paragraph 13.12 we mentioned, as a possible alternative to a textualmemorandum, the device known as the Keeling Schedule. This device is of comparatively recent origin. It was adopted as a trial in 1938 to meet a complaintby several Members of the House of Commons headed by Mr E H Keeling(later Sir Edward Keeling) and Mr R P Croom-Johnson (later Mr JusticeCroom-Johnson, father of the present judge) that there was far too muchlegislation by reference which Members could not understand without the
texts of the principal Acts referred to as they would appear if amended. Amongtheir proposals for improving the situation was a suggestion that in everyBill which amended previous enactments, those enactments should be re-enacted,with the amendments made by the Bill, in a Schedule which would be preservedagainst amendment or debate by new Standing Orders. In effect the Schedulewould serve the same purpose as a textual memorandum to an amending bill drafted exclusively on the textual amendment principle. By directionof the Prime Minister these and other proposals were discussed at a meeting between Mr Keeling and Mr Croom-Johnson and Sir Granville Ram, thenFirst Parliamentary Counsel. The outcome was a Question and Answer in theHouse of Commons on 26 July 1938. In practice it was not found necessaryto amend Standing Orders since the form of the clause by which the KeelingSchedule was introduced ensured that no amendments could be moved to that schedule except those which were strictly consequential upon amendments to the substantive provisions of the Bill.13.22 The Keeling Schedule has never been considered to be capable of universal or even wide application. It is only used where the changes made bythe Bill in the previous enactments are exclusively textual amendments orrepeals; and even then it is not used if the previous enactments have been amended non-textually by any intervening Act. Again, it would be quite impracticable, and generally quite useless, to reproduce in a Keeling Scheduleall the previous enactments in which merely consequential amendments andrepeals are made. This would add enormously to the length of Bills and Acts,for very little purpose, since consequential amendments and repeals are generallytaken pretty well on trust. Accordingly, the occasions when it has been bothuseful and practicable to include a Keeling Schedule have been relatively few,but there has been a fairly steady flow over the past 35 years averaging about1-2- per Session. The Keeling technique not only shows, in the Schedule, how the law will look once it is amended, but also makes clear, in the text of the bill itself, how the law is being amended. Material proposed to be omitted froman existing Act is indicated in the Schedule by a series of dots. Lord Gardinerin his evidence to us complained of the inconvenience of not being able to seeat a glance from the Schedule what was to be left out, and suggested that material to be omitted should be printed in distinguishing type. We agree with thissuggestion, and we recommend that it should be followed in future.CONSOLIDATION AND ITS EFFECT ON AMENDMENT13.23 The value of textual amendment to the user of the statutes in helpinghim to a clearer understanding of the law depends, as we have already said, onthe availability of good editions which will accurately reflect the changes being brought about. This in turn depends on the state of the statute law being amended.There is less scope for textual amendment if the draftsman is operating on a code which is in need of consolidation; and thus in the case of certain amend-ments it would not at present be possible to use the textual method because the amendments would need to be written into texts which are unconsolidated. Theadoption of textual amendment as the general practice whenever convenient willnot therefore have its full effect until the programme of consolidation has beenspeeded up. We are told that the prospects for this are not good. Over the past25 years the average number of pages of consolidation Acts passed in one year
has been 400, and this has probably not kept pace with the rate at which legisla-tion is being amended. First Parliamentary Counsel estimates that in the wholeStatute Book there may be not less than 8,000 pages of legislation needing to beconsolidated. We deal in Chapter XIV with the problems confronting those responsible for the consolidation programme. We would stress here that thereis a close link between the pace of consolidation and the rate at which textualamendment can have a beneficial effect on the clarity and simplicity of ourlegislation; and we consider that speedier consolidation is an objective to whichthe highest importance ought to be attached. In paragraph 14.36 we recommendthat the pace of consolidation should be accelerated.CONCLUSION13.24 During the past few years there has been a change of emphasis in themethod of drafting Bills to amend existing legislation. Before that change, thecommonest method of amending an Act was to state in the amending Bill thesubstance of the amendment proposed to be made without altering the text of the Act to be amended. Since that change, it has been the practice to amendlegislation textually whenever convenience permits. We welcome the newpractice and recommend that it should be applied as generously as possible.Where a Keeling Schedule or a textual memorandum can assist members ofParliament or others in understanding amendments made by the textual method,such a Schedule or memorandum should be provided whenever it is reasonably practicable to do so.
Chapter XIVCONSOLIDATIONTHE NEED FOR CONSOLIDATION14.1 We have received from many sources evidence to the effect that muchof the difficulty encountered by users of the statute law arises from the factthat the provisions relating to a given matter are to be found not in one self-contained Act but in a series of Acts piled one upon another at different dates,so that the investigation of a particular problem requires simultaneous referenceto a number of separate Acts, probably scattered among a number of separateannual volumes. Often some of these Acts deal primarily with matters otherthan the one in question.14.2 These difficulties have not been by any means ignored and for manyyears efforts have been made to tackle the problem by &quot;consolidation&quot; that is,by rewriting the scattered provisions on a given matter in the form of a singleAct. Unfortunately however legislation does not stand still and it inevitablyhappens that sooner or later after a consolidated Act on a particular matter has been produced further enactments on that matter make their appearance,thus eventually producing a state of affairs which again calls for consolidation.So the need for consolidation is perpetual.14.3 Unfortunately, too, the resources of manpower needed to produceconsolidation Acts are limited and the output has never overtaken the backlogof work requiring to be done, and indeed does not keep pace with the amount ofwork called for by the continuing flow of new legislation. First parliamentary counsel has given us &quot;a very rough estimate&quot; that there are about eight thousandpages of Acts which are in need of consolidation. If the output of consolidationdoes not keep pace with the additional need for consolidation which is beingcreated by the continuing flow of new legislation, then the backlog must inevitably increase. We regard it as self-evident that the backlog ought to be eliminated as soon as possible. First Parliamentary Counsel has said that, on avery rough estimate, to work off the backlog would call for a trebling of thecurrent rate of consolidation for not less than ten years.14.4 One of the arguments in favour of the textual method of amendment(discussed in Chapter XIII) is that, if it is accompanied by the swift productionof edited prints of the amended Acts, it will to some extent diminish the needfor consolidation. However, we do not believe that it will ever eliminate theneed if only because (as we have concluded in Chapter XIII) there can beno rigid rule that amendment must always be effected textually and so there is bound to continue to be some flow of legislation having non-textual effects onearlier legislation on the same matter.14.5 Opportunities for using the textual method of amendment are greater,in relation to any given matter, if the existing provisions relating to the matter
are contained in a consolidated Act than if they are scattered through a numberof separate Acts. We have concluded that the use of the textual method of amendment is desirable; it follows that consolidation is also desirable to providea base for the use of that method of amendment, as well as for the directbenefits which it brings on its own account.A CRASH PROGRAMME?14.6 In these circumstances everyone is agreed that the work of consolidationis extremely important and should be pressed on with. Opinions, however,differ as to the scale on which efforts for this purpose should be based. On theone hand some, notably the Statute Law Society, urge that the entire corpus ofthe statute law should be rewritten in the form of a small number of &quot;principal&quot;Acts or codes, each dealing with a single branch of the law, or &quot;subject&quot;. TheStatute Law Society&apos;s evidence to us included a statement that:&quot;The user&apos;s basic requirements. are that all legislation on a particularsubject be contained in its latest form in one place comprehensively, andthat there should be one subject for each Act and one Act for each subject.This is, however, not the case.&quot;The Society went on to urge that there should be:&quot;a large programme of consolidation whereby all the statute law relatingto each subject, wherever it is to be found, shall be collected together,integrated and harmonised in a single Act which will deal exclusivelywith that subject. . . Our aim also involved the preservation of the integrity of this consolidation so that, once it had been achieved, new legislation relating to a particular subject would not be found in any statute relatingto another subject.&quot;They further urge that this programme of consolidation should be what theycall a &quot;crash programme&quot;, planned to cover the whole work within a limited number of years. On the other hand others regard this as impracticable andfeel that if an unrealistic target were set the prospect of achieving anythinguseful would be jeopardised.14.7 We do not think that the consolidation of the statue book on a &quot;oneAct, one subject&quot; principle is feasible. The proposal is, in our view, based on theerroneous assumption that every statute can be completely intelligible as anisolated enactment without reference to the provisions of any other statute. Itis not reasonable to expect the law on a given subject to be set forth completelyin a self-contained Act of Parliament; and even if it could be, a major problem would be to settle a generally acceptable division of the corpus of the statute law into the broad &quot;subjects&quot; which the suggestion envisages. This last point isnot so simple as it may sound. The problem is to determine the breadth of the&quot;subjects&quot;. At first sight it might seem that, for example, &quot;Customs and Excise&quot;is a branch of the law which might form a &quot;subject&quot;. But the person who isinterested in duties on hydro-carbon oil will not want to pay for, and wadethrough, an enormous Act containing the whole of the customs and exciselegislation; he will be much happier with a slim volume consolidating the enactments relating to the duties on hydro-carbon oil and like substances which under the present system he can find in the Hydro-carbon Oil (Customs and
Excise) Act 1971. What such a person wants is the needle without the haystack.Examples can be multiplied. The breeder of dachshunds will want an Act aboutdogs but will not want one which covers also cock-fighting and the export ofponies, under the omnibus &quot;subject&quot; of &quot;Animals&quot;. There are many Acts on thestatute book dealing with films. At first sight &quot;films&quot; might appear to be an attractive subject for a principal Act. But further study would show that theActs fall into two distinct classes: (a) those dealing with the financing of theproduction of films, and (b) those dealing with their exhibition. Some users of thestatute book would be interested in both these subjects, but many would be interested in one of them only. In those circumstances a principal Act dealingwith films generally is not the ideal solution. What is required is two separateActs consolidating (a) and (b) respectively.14.8 Moreover it would be a prerequisite of such a rearrangement of thestatute book that there should be a system of perpetual consolidation envisaged by the Statute Law Society in their evidence to us. It is of the essence of the suggested scheme that each &quot;principal&quot; Act, once it has reached the statute book, should be maintained perpetually as a self-contained unit ie that any future legislation touching on the &quot;subject&quot; concerned should be effected by atextual amendment of the &quot;principal&quot; Act. This system would also requirethe insertion into the parent Act of self-contained passages which were notamending it but which might suitably be consigned to the Act if it were beingconsolidated. Drafting of this kind is sometimes called &quot;slotting in&quot;. It is rarelyfound in legislation at Westminster; but in some Commonwealth countries themethod is employed to rewrite large portions of an Act. For example, in theCanadian Income Tax Act of 1971 no less than 600 pages, or 237 sections, aredrafted as a single insertion to be made in the main Income Tax Act. But webelieve that, however well the original framework of a &quot;principal&quot; Act is designed, there will inevitably be occasions when new provisions on the subjectare required but cannot easily be cast in the form of textual amendment oraddition; and that even if all such provisions are cast in that form there willsooner or later arrive a stage at which they will distort the original to an unacceptable extent. We therefore do not believe that a system of perpetualconsolidation as proposed by the Statute Law Society would be practicable.But even if it were possible to attempt such a perpetual consolidation, we do not accept that Acts framed in this way would necessarily be clearer or simpler for theuser.14.9 Finally, it is clear that a crash programme of the kind suggested wouldrequire the recruitment and training of a large number of draftsmen; and while we have recommended that the number of draftsmen should be increased (see paragraphs 8.22 above and 14.18 below) we do not think that an increase onthe scale required for a programme of this nature could in practice be achieved in the foreseeable future.14.10 Agreeing as we do, therefore, with those who think that while a fasterrate of consolidation is highly desirable the suggestion made by the statute law Society, interesting though it is, is neither practicable nor desirable, weturn now to consider whether the present system is adequate as it stands or issusceptible of realistic improvement. First we outline briefly what the presentsystem is.
THE CURRENT ACHIEVEMENT14.11 As we have mentioned in Chapter II the direction of consolidationwork has since 1965 been in the hands of the two Law Commissions. Under theLaw Commissions Act 1965 the Commissions have a general duty to review thelaw with which they are respectively concerned with a view (among other things)to the reduction of the number of separate enactments; and in particular theyare required to prepare from time to time at the request of the appropriate minister (or Ministers) comprehensive programmes of consolidation and toundertake the preparation of draft Bills pursuant, to programmes approved byhim or them. In practice some of the projects contained in approved programmeshave for a variety of reasons had to be dropped; but on the other hand aconsiderable number of Bills outside these programmes have been undertakenand completed. In preparing programmes and in initiating projects outside the programmes the Commissions consult with the Goverment departmentsconcerned, whose co-operation in the preparation of the Bills is of course anessential element and is generously given so far as possible.14.12 The necessary drafting work is undertaken partly by the Parliamentarydraftsmen attached to the Commissions; and partly by those in the officeof the Parliamentary Counsel and in the Lord Advocate&apos;s Department, who in the course of their other work have opportunities of seeing and suggestingpossible subjects for consolidation, and sometimes for effecting in ordinaryBills changes which will eventually facilitate future consolidation. Of thedraftsmen currently attached to the English Law Commission two devote their time wholly or mainly to consolidation projects, but this arrangement is liableto be upset by the demands of law reform at a time like the present when theLaw Commission^ complement of draftsmen is below full strength. In the caseof the Scottish Commission all this work has to be fitted in, as and when possible,with work on draft clauses for law reform Bills.14.13 When a consolidation Bill has been prepared it has to be submittedto Parliament for enactment. For this purpose there are special procedures,designed to ensure either that no change in the law is being made or that onlychanges of a minor nature, required to produce a satisfactory and coherentresult, are introduced. The Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills, the pro-cedure provided by the Consolidation of Enactments (Procedure) Act 1949,and the procedure for consolidation with amendments to give effect to recom-mendations of the Law Commissions have been described in Chapters II and IV(paragraphs 2.15, 4.13 to 4.17). Under this system and the broadly similar procedure which preceded it a considerable amount of consolidation has been achieved since 1965. We give in Appendix C a list of the consolidation Actsfrom 1966 to 1974, amounting to 61.14.14 This list represents a considerable achievement and in our view itdemonstrates that within the limitations imposed by the available resourcesgreat efforts have been made to forward the work of consolidation as fast as possible. For this we pay tribute to all concerned. Nevertheless the workin our opinion is so important for the attainment of clarity and simplicity inthe statute law as it develops that we have endeavoured to identify and evaluate the obstacles which prevent the system from reaching an even higher rateof output.
THE MAIN OBSTACLESShortage of draftsmen14.15 It is wide of the mark to suppose that consolidation can be carriedout by any competent lawyer with the aid of scissors and paste. It is highly skilled work. One of the objects of consolidation is to produce clear and unam-biguous drafting, sometimes from very unpromising material. What LordThring said to a Select Committee in 1875 is still true today:&quot;consolidation. . . is really a matter very often of extreme difficulty,more than the Committee would imagine . . . There is very great difficultyin getting it done; it is a task requiring exceedingly skilled and rare labour,and the labour of months . . . skilled labour of a character which I cannotalways get; it is not altogether a question of money&quot;.114.16 The Law Commission^ requirement for draftsmen is basically met bythe Parliamentary Counsel Office, who normally supply at least four draftsmenon secondment to do a two-year tour of duty at the Law Commission. We havealready adverted in paragraphs 3.2 and 8.19 to the fact that the number ofdraftsmen supplied to the Law Commission in this way is at the momentbelow what is normal and below what is desirable. The Law Commission have,with the help and support of the First Parliamentary Counsel, sought to supplement the supply of draftsmen in several ways. To reinforce the regulardraftsmen they have recruited, to the limits of what is possible, retired membersof the Parliamentary Counsel Office. In addition, they have a departmentallawyer of great experience who is engaged (with the assistance of a formerCommonwealth public servant with special skill in these matters) on the highly important work of statute law repeal. The &quot;farming out&quot; of consolidationwork has already achieved one consolidation, and further experiments with&quot;farming out&quot; are now being made.14.17 As mentioned in paragraph 14.12 above, the Scottish Law commission have no draftsmen specifically for consolidation work. This work, so far asScotland-only projects are concerned, is undertaken as and when possible by the one whole-time and one part-time draftsmen who are at the Commission&apos;disposal primarily for drafting clauses for proposed law reform Bills. TheScottish aspect of Anglo-Scottish consolidation projects is attended to, along with their other work, by the Scottish Parliamentary Draftsmen in co-operationwith the English counsel attached to the English Commission. These resources,limited as they are by the general difficulty of recruiting draftsmen, are not,in our opinion, sufficient for a proper attack on the consolidation work needingto be done.14.18 Although it does indeed require skill, there seems to be agreement among those best qualified to know that the drafting of consolidations is not quite so exacting as the drafting of major current Bills, for which additionalskills and experience are needed. We recommend, therefore, that the LawCommissions and the Parliamentary draftsmen should continue to explore^Report from the Select Committee on Acts of Parliament, Minutes of Evidence, Q 1648,Q 1759, Q 1762.
the possibility of recruiting and training for consolidation work lawyers with thenecessary aptitudes who have not had the full training of Parliamentarydraftsmen.Pressure on departmental officials14.19 Without the assistance of departmental lawyers and administratorsconsolidation cannot be carried out. For instance, in the consolidation of social security legislation recently undertaken, many administrators have to be consulted as part of the process of ensuring that the consolidation accuratelyreflects the existing law. This requires at the departmental end the directionof a senior official. It is not uncommon for a consolidation project to be held up because the administrators concerned are engaged on other matters.14.20 We understand, however, that both Commissions press with vigour andsuccess the interest of the public in the rapid advance of consolidation workand the strong claim which that work has, even when weighed with other claims,on departmental resources.Pressure on the joint committee on consolidation Bills14.21 The functions of the Joint Select Committee on Consolidation Bills,have already been described (paragraphs 4.13 to 4.19). These functions require;from the members of the Committee, and especially from its Chairman (atpresent Lord Simon of Glaisdale), a tremendous amount of work, for whichthe public is deeply indebted to them. But there is of course a limit to the numberof Bills which the Committee, with the best will in the world, can consider in aSession and we believe that (after the shortage of draftsmen) this constitutes thesecond most significant impediment to speedier progress. Anything whichmight ease the Committee&apos;s workload should therefore be considered.14.22 An important contribution towards easing the load on the JointCommittee is the close liaison between the Law Commissions and the Chairmanof the Committee, to ensure that the work is spaced as well as possible to suitthe Committee&apos;s convenience. All concerned have taken great care overliaison arrangements, and we believe that they work well.14.23 We accept that the Joint Committee as it normally operates could not undertake a much greater volume of work. We understand, however, that theCommittee have on occasion, when faced with an unusually heavy volume ofwork, made arrangements whereby, in effect, they sit in two divisions. TheChairman takes the chair in one and a Deputy Chairman is appointed to takethe chair in the other. We recommend that this practice should be adoptedwhenever the flow of consolidation measures exceeds the capacity of the JointCommittee for dealing with them under their ordinary mode of operation.We recognise, however, that if the flow of consolidation measures increases to theextent that we hope it will, some further means of providing for the necessaryexpansion in the Parliamentary machinery may have to be found.Need for prior amendment of the law14.24 In many cases there is a need for amendment of the law before consolida-tion can be proceeded with. This is an old problem. The Law Commissions
have made a major contribution towards solving it, by devising the technique of consolidation with amendments to give effect to recommendations of the commissions (outlined in paragraphs 4.13 to 4.17). This technique has provedof great value, and has been used in at least nine consolidation Bills, including such important measures as the Town and Country Planning Act 1971, theTown and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1972 and the Road Traffic Act 1972.14.25 A further technique recently invented and as yet untried is to conferpower on Her Majesty to make by Order in Council amendments of acts of Parliament required to facilitate consolidation. At present there are twoenactments conferring such powers: section 57(6) of the National Health ServiceReorganisation Act 1973 and section 7 of the Pensioners&apos; Payments and national insurance Act 1973. In both these cases orders made in the exercise of the powers are subject only to negative resolution. We think this device might be more acceptable with stronger safeguards, and therefore we recommend that if other powers of this nature are to be conferred their exercise should be made subject to affirmative resolution, and that no such resolution should be takenin the House of Commons until the relevant order had been reported by theJoint Committee on Statutory Instruments.Need to repeal obsolescent law14.26 The process of consolidation can be slowed down by the presence onthe statute book of obsolescent law which clearly relates to the subject matter to be consolidated but is of dubious meaning and uncertain practical utility.This has in the past been a significant obstacle to consolidation. It was notdealt with satisfactorily by the old type of Statute Law Revision Bill, the purposeof which was merely to facilitate the production of a revised edition of the statutes by striking out unrepealed provisions which had become inoperative.14.27 Here again, the Law Commissions have initiated a change of major importance. They now regularly prepare for presentation to ParliamentStatute Law (Repeals) Bills which repeal not only matter which is inoperative,but also matter which is no longer of practical utility. These Bills are accom-panied by a very full report of the Law Commissions and are referred to theJoint Committee on Consolidation Bills.New and prospective legislation14.28 It frequently happens that a major consolidation, once embarked on,has to be postponed because of current Government programme legislation in the same field. This has been experienced in several important fields, includinglocal government (now happily dealt with in a comprehensive Act), the national health Acts, and, very recently, the Housing Acts. At the end of June 1972 adraftsman was engaged by the Law Commission to undertake the consilidation of housing legislation in England and Wales. The work was well advancedon the consolidation Bill, which would have included over 350 clauses and overtwenty schedules, when the Government decided to introduce substantialnew housing legislation. Work on the consolidation Bill has in consequencehad to be suspended. The Housing Acts were listed as a priority topic for con-solidation in the Law Commission^ second programme. This experience
illustrates the ease with which a programme of consolidation can be upsetby policy decisions involving major amendments of the existing law. such decisions can upset the programme not only by interfering with programmedconsolidations which are already under way, but also with programmedconsolidations which are immediately in prospect. And the instability of a programme of consolidation, of course, increases with every increase in thenumber of subjects it covers.14.29 The Lav/ Commissions have compensated for this inherent weakness ofthe &quot;programme&quot; approach to consolidation by an alert seizure of opportunitiesas they present themselves. That the compensation is not negligible is shownnot only by the quantity of consolidation achieved, but also by the fact that it includes such major topics as town and country planning (Town and country planning Act 1971) (which had not been included in the programme) and thecurrent Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Bill (which was not included untilthe preparation of the Bill was far advanced).14.30 It is not only a decision to introduce new legislation which may holdup consolidation projects. Once reform of a particular part of our statute law is under consideration by a Minister, or is even &quot;in the air&quot; as a resultof the report of a Royal Commission or departmental committee, or as a resultof departmental cerebration, the Minister and the department may, we are told, show a marked and, indeed, pertinacious reluctance to consolidate thelaw as it stands. Such reluctance can have the same effect on the programmeof consolidation as an actual decision to introduce maior amending legislation.14.31 We regard these two factors, together with the need for amending legislation, as most inimical to the orderly and expeditious carrying out of anyprogramme of consolidation. Even here, however, the Law Commissions have demonstrated their resource and flexibility by the speed with which they havebeen able to turn from a consolidation which has become temporarily impossibleto one or more consolidations which can be carried out at once. In this way they have been able to maintain a strong momentum for consolidation.14.32 It is evident that the risk that a consolidation may need to be postponed for the reasons discussed in paragraphs 14.28 to 14.31 is greater where a wide field of legislation is chosen for consolidation, and we think that it might there-fore be prudent in many cases to select a relatively narrow field provided thiswas consistent, in the particular instance, with users&apos; needs (see paragraph 14.7).CONCLUSIONS14.33 We agree that the more consolidation there is the better will our legislationbecome, but as we have pointed out there are real difficulties about increasingthe present speed of consolidation within present resources, which we considershould be increased as soon as possible. We accept that responsibility forconsolidation should continue to rest with the Law Commissions who, as well ascommanding great expertise, approach this task with dedicated enthusiasm aslaw reformers. Even if it were within our terms of reference to do so, we wouldnot recommend that responsibility should, as has been suggested to us, betransferred to a new body.
14.34 While we do not consider that &quot;a crash programme&quot; to consolidate the entire statute book would be feasible, we nevertheless emphasise thatas and when opportunities arise for increasing the amount of consolidation,such opportunities should not be missed. The size of the programmes of con-solidation has to be governed by the realities of the situation and a pragmaticapproach seems to be inevitable, but every effort should be made to overcome the various difficulties to which we have referred so that a real advance can bemade in the speed of consolidation.14.35 In view of our recommendations that textual amendment should, sofar as possible, come to be regarded as the normal method of amending statutes,we feel bound to point out that this process would be facilitated by more rapid consolidation; but we do not consider that the present pace of consolida-tion need hamper the further introduction of textual amendment.14.36 In short we recommend that the pace of consolidation should beaccele-rated. There are no instant ways of overcoming all the various impedimentswe have discussed, but given time and willpower these difficulties could be largely overcome.
Chapter XVEXPLANATORY MATERIAL15.1 Explanatory material, external to the text of an Act (either at the Bill stageor later) is often provided by the Government to assist both the legislator andthe eventual user. This material is not part of the Act and may not necessarilyinfluence the form in which the Act is drafted. It is thus strictly speaking beyond our terms of reference. But it does contribute indirectly to the ease with whichthe Act can be understood.15.2 The degree of complexity in legislation and the specialisation of itssubject matter vary greatly. So too (as we showed in Chapter X) does the natureof the audience to whom aids to its understanding have to be addressed. whereas in all cases due weight must be given to the needs of Parliament, the range ofother persons whose needs require to be taken into account may extend from members of the public who want a broad, general picture of what is involved, tospecialised, professional or trade interests which require a highly technical andprecise explanation to enable them to assess the detailed legal effect of thelegislation. The question whether any, and if so, what kind of external explanatorymaterial should be provided is best considered separately for each statute, andwe are told by the Lord President of the Council that this is the Governmenfspractice.15.3 Material of this kind is provided by the Government at three stages ofthe process of legislation: at the pre-Parliamentary consultative stage; duringthe passage of the Bill through Parliament; and after Royal Assent. We dealwith each of these stages in turn.BEFORE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE BILL15.4 We referred in paragraph 8.5 to the &quot;grey area&quot;, using this expression to describe the formative stage at which policy decisions are translated intoinstructions to the draftsman. The decisions that are taken then will have a vital bearing on the form of the legislation as it is presented to Parliament.At this stage, in the case of important legislative proposals, the main featuresare normally foreshadowed by a Government statement or policy document,for example, a White or a Green Paper. Such a document is intended to serve as a basis for informed discussion, in Parliament and elsewheie, of the generalaims of the proposed legislation. In the case of law reform Bills proposed by theLaw Commissions, the reports of these Commissions are also available toParliament and the general public.15.5 We warmly approve of the increasing readiness of Governments toproduce Green or White Papers in advance of legislation. In many non-contentious fields the Governmenfs proposals could be published in some detail. We believe that this practice should greatly help those who will eventually be using the legislation to a better understanding of its purpose. The discussion which this generates should also help the drafting team to anticipate difficulties
that might not otherwise have been foreseen. We accordingly recommend thatthis practice should be still further extended. (The first part of Appendix Dlists the documents published by the Government before the Local government bill 1972 was presented to Parliament.)DURING THE PASSAGE OF THE BILLExplanatory and financial memoranda15.6 A further aid to the understanding of legislation, primarily directed towards Parliament, but also available for wider circulation, is the practiceof printing a memorandum attached to a Bill explaining its contents and objects.This is prepared, in the case of Government Bills, by the department whoseMinister is introducing the Bill. It must be drafted in non-technical languageand contain nothing of an argumentative character.1 All Government Billsinvolving expenditure must be accompanied by a financial memorandum setting out briefly the financial effect of the Bill and containing an estimate, where possible, of the amount of money to be spent and of any increase in manpowerresulting from it. The nature and extent of the information provided in suchmemoranda depends upon the subject matter of the legislation concerned.15.7 The Select Committee on Procedure of the House of Commons in its second Report for 1970-712 recommended that explanatory memorandashould be drafted to give a description of the purposes and effect of a Bill and,where appropriate, of the White Paper or Report from which it originated;and that in the case of long or complicated Bills, detailed explanations should beprovided in a separate White Paper. The Government of the day undertook to implement this recommendation as far as practicable.3 The impression wehave received from First Parliamentary Counsel is that explanatory memorandaare perhaps rather longer now than they were before. Evidence we have had from other witnesses clearly indicates that an expansion of the informationprovided in explanatory memoranda to Bills would be welcomed by manyorganisations outside Parliament who wish to understand the effect of the pro-posals of the Bill. The National Farmer&apos;s Union, for example, have suggestedthat-&quot;explanatory memoranda set out at the front of new Bills could with generaladvantage be considerably expanded and made much more explanatory&quot;.The National Citizens&apos; Advice Bureaux Council have told us that-&quot;explanatory notes at the front of Bills are very helpful. They do give some indication of the purpose of the legislation and what changes willbe effected. We wonder if this could not be expanded a little so that it iseasier for the layman to establish the current position and how it is proposedto change it&quot;.The Accountancy Bodies have submitted to us that there is, in relation to revenue law,&quot;a great need for the publication with each Finance Bill of an explanatory memorandum which goes into much greater detail than anything hithertoiErskine May, 18th Edition, p 481.2HC 538 paragraph 22.3HC Deb, 825, c 650.
available . . . Our ability to make helpful representations to the InlandRevenue during the early stages of a Finance Bill would be much enhancedif we had access to a document which explained in detail, clause by clause,and with appropriate examples, the reasons for and the effect of theproposed legislation&quot;.While we consider that the concluding part of this last suggestion may gotoo far to be practicable, what the accountants have said about the need for more detailed information on the provisions of Finance Bills reinforces theviews expressed by the two bodies mentioned previously, and by other witnesses,that explanatory memoranda could be amplified. We therefore endorse therecommendation of the Select Committee that such memoranda should provide more information about the Bill. We deal with the Committee&apos;s recommenda-tion about the publication of explanatory White Papers in paragraph 15.11below.15.8 The Joint Committee on Delegated Legislation in its Second Reportto Parliament in Session 1972/731 (paragraphs 53 and 54) recommended that&quot;in order to assist Parliament to check that the instruments proposed are made subject to the appropriate procedure . . . there should be included in theexplanatory memorandum which is normally attached to every Public bill section headed &apos;Delegated Legislation&apos; containing a list of all delegatedpowers to. be conferred by the Bill, with an indication of the category into which each power falls. This section would . . . follow the normal form of explanatory memorandum in being purely factual&quot;. They added (paragraph 54) that theCommittee &quot;trust that this matter will be brought to the attention of the Com-mittee on the Preparation of Legislation as a recommendation of your committee, rather than as a tentative proposal&quot;. In their memorandum to that committee, the Leaders of both Houses suggested that this proposal &quot;might appropriately be considered&quot; by us. We cannot see how such a requirementwould help to achieve greater simplicity or clarity in the Bill, but we realise that it could be a convenience to Members of Parliament, and accordinglywe raise no objection.Other explanatory material provided during the Bill stage15.9 A variant of the practice of printing explanatory memoranda at thebeginning of the Bill proposed by several witnesses is that explanatory notes on individual clauses should be printed on the pages of the Bill opposite the clauses to which they refer. We have had evidence of how such an arrangementis operated in Canada. On several recent occasions, notably when the LocalGovernment Bill 1972 was going through Parliament, the Minister in chargeof the Bill has made available to Members of both Houses the notes on clausesprepared for his own use by his department to assist him in dealing with questions raised in debate. A suggestion was in fact made in the commons debate on the Second Reading of the Nullity of Marriage bill by Mr A W Lyonthat it would have been helpful to the House if the Bill had been published in theform in which the Law Commission^ draft Bill had been published in theAppendix of their Report,3 that is to say, with the explanatory notes printed1HL 204, HC 468.2HC Deb, 810, cc 1165-6.&quot;Report on Nullity of Marriage HC 164, 1970-71.
opposite the clauses to which they related. This proposal was considered by theHouse of Commons Select Committee on Procedure in 1970-71. They thoughtthat explanatory notes on clauses, even in technical and non-controversialBills, would almost certainly be argumentative, as their purpose would be to givereasons for the adoption of the clauses. On a controversial Bill it would beeven more difficult to exclude argument. (As we have explained in para-graph 15.6, the rule stated in Erskine May is that an explanatory memorandum should be framed in non-technical language and should contain nothing of anargumentative character.) For these reasons the Select Committee stated intheir Second Report for 1970-71 that they did not consider any change was desirable in the practice of the House on this matter.115.10 Nevertheless, the provisions of the Local Government Bill 1972 towhich we refer in paragraph 15.9 were extremely complex, they affected agreat many other enactments, and they were of great significance to all english and Welsh constituencies. The Minister felt that Parliament would find it morethan ordinarily difficult to understand the effects of the Bill, and so additionalexplanatory material in the form of notes on clauses, maps and explanations of major amendments was made available to Members of the Commons StandingCommittee and to Peers generally for Committee stage debates. (These arelisted in the second part of Appendix D.) This has been done on one or two other occasions. We think that this is a very helpful practice, and we recommendthat it should be developed. If this can be done with complex and evencontroversial Bills, we find it hard to believe that in the case of uncontroversialBills the rule against argument would be difficult to observe. We also recommendthat a trial should be made, initially with uncontroversial Bills, of printingexplanatory notes opposite the clauses to which they refer.15.11 The recommendation of the Select Committee on Procedure to whichwe refer in paragraph 15.7 also urged2 that in the case of long or complicatedBills, detailed explanations should be provided in a separate White Paper, andwe have enquired about the number of occasions on which White Papers havebeen published for this purpose since the Government, in November 1971,agreed to implement this recommendation wherever possible. Between that date and March 1974, only four White Papers were published (all in 1972) with the express purpose of explaining Bills that they accompanied. These werememoranda on:(a) The provisions of the Electricity Bill 1972 (Cmnd 4877, January 1972)(b) The value added tax provisions of the Finance Bill 1972 (Cmnd 4929,March 1972)(c) The corporation tax provisions of the Finance Bill 1972 (Cmnd 4955,April 1972)(d) The provisions of the Furnished Lettings (Rent Allowances) Bill 1972(Cmnd 5183, December 1972)The last of these is a textual memorandum containing nothing but the text of the relevant provisions of the Housing Finance Act 1972 and the correspondingScottish Act as proposed to be amended by the Bill. It is thus in a somewhat*HC 538, paragraph 63.2Ibid, paragraph 22.
different category of explanatory material, with which we deal elsewhere. in only two Bills, therefore, has the Select Committee&apos;s recommendation beenadopted; and only one of them, the Finance Bill 1972 was long and complicated.We consider that detailed explanations of the provisions of lengthy and complexBills are useful, that the practice adopted with the Finance Act 1972 of issuingseparate publications dealing with separable subjects covered by one Bill iscommendable where appropriate, and we recommend that such explanatorymaterial should be provided more frequently in the form of White Papers.15.12 Throughout the several stages of legislation there is a constant exchangeof information between the sponsoring department and the various interests affected by the Bill about its purpose and the detailed implications of the text. InParliament itself the intention of the legislation will be explained by ministers in broad terms at Second Reading, and in detail during the committee stages.Frequently there is also correspondence between Ministers and Members. Ifthe Parliamentary timetable allows, ample opportunity is thus given to Membersof either House and to individuals and interests affected by the Bill not only tosuggest amendments on points of substance but also to raise questions about any textual obscurity or doubt.15.13 It may sometimes be useful, in the case of amending Bills drafted on thetextual amendment principle, to present the Bill to Parliament with a white paper showing how the existing legislation would look if the proposals beingconsidered by Parliament were enacted. We deal with textual memoranda inparagraphs 13.12 and 13.13.AFTER ROYAL ASSENT15.14 The explanatory material we have been describing from paragraph 15.6onwards is primarily for the benefit of the legislators to assist them in theirunderstanding of Bills submitted to them for enactment. Although such material is also of help to members of the public and organisations who have an interestin a particular Bill, its main value is that it helps Parliament to focus on the substantive issues that should be debated, and thus to ensure that the text ofthe statute gives effect as accurately as possible to the legislative intention ofParliament. This purpose is fulfilled once the Bill has been enacted. Accordinglyexplanatory, financial and manpower memoranda are not printed with theAct after Royal Assent.15.15 As soon as a Bill has finally passed through its Parliamentary stagesGovernment departments can turn their attention to publicising and admin-istering its provisions. In may cases, it is essential to the enforcement of a newlaw on a particular date that those affected should be given prior information and advice about its effect. Generally however any action taken by departments to publicise and explain the effects of a new law is taken after enactment. this may take a variety of forms. In the case of new taxes, for example, leaflets andpublic notices are prepared and distributed to business firms and made availableto members of the public. Public advertisements may also be used; and visitsmay be made by officials to traders who are likely to be affected.15.16 Such material does not purport to give authoritative advice on thelegal interpretation of the provisions referred to, or about the legislative intentof Parliament. Those to whom departmental circulars and other similar
documents on new Acts are addressed are well aware of the limitations of suchpapers. But they are nevertheless widely relied upon as practical guides to what may be highly complicated and technical Acts; and they are of considerablevalue to those who must understand and administer the provisions of new legislation. (The third part of Appendix D lists the documents prepared by government departments after the Local Government Act 1972 received theRoyal Assent).15.17 The practice of Government departments with regard to post-legislativeexplanatory material is well established and appears to serve its purposeadequately.
Chapter XVIHOW COMPUTERS WOULD HELP16.1 We have received written evidence on the application of computertechnology to the legislative process from the Society for Computers and LawLtd; and oral evidence from Mr S J Skelly, Director of Jurimetrics in,theDepartment of Justice of Canada, where such application has reached an advanced stage, and from Professor Reed Dickersomln addition, much materialon the subject, published and unpublished, has been studied by a working group of four members of our Committee.16.2 Since we were appointed the Statute Law Committee has set up a Sub-Committee with the following terms of reference:&quot;To investigate and advise the Statute Law Committee from time totime about ways in which computer technology can be used to assistthe process of drafting and publishing Acts and statutory instruments and indices and other aids to their use, and (so far as lies within the province of the Statute Law Committee) the system of handling Bills in their passage through Parliament&quot;.We welcome the decision to set up such a body, and indeed we regard it asurgently necessary.16.3 Having regard to our terms of reference, our main concern has naturallybeen with the use of computer technology as an aid to the draftsman, especially when engaged upon consolidation or upon any other Bill which requires the study of a mass of previous legislation. It has, however, proved impossiblefor us to consider this aspect in isolation since (as will appear) the effective useof the computer as a drafting aid inevitably raises questions as to:(a) its cost-effectiveness, whether used by the draftsman only or by othersas well;(b) its use in the printing process; and(c) the material that should be stored in the computer, and the arrange-ments for getting it there in the first instance and for its subsequentupdating.Whilst such questions will clearly be the subject of detailed study by the statute law Committee, the evidence we have received suggests certain conclusionsabout them which we record.CONCEPTS AND TERMINOLOGY16.4 A simple conceptual picture of the computer, and an explanation of somepossibly unfamiliar terms, may be helpful as an introduction to this chapter.16.5Input Medium		Processing Unit		Output Medium				
The computer may be compared to the human mind. In the diagram above,the box on the left represents the input medium or source of information. Inrelation to the human mind, this could be a book, a picture, a television screen,or any source of information detectable by one of the senses. In the case of the computer, it could be information stored in a punched card, a magnetic tape, orany other machine readable form that is to say, any form the computer canwork with. While a computer can &quot;read&quot; a magnetic tape of information, itcannot strictly speaking read a book containing the same information. Opticalcharacter recognition systems, which scan the printed page and produce a machine-readable version, have been developed, but at present the conversionof printed matter into a machine-readable form normally involves its beingtyped manually, through a typewriter terminal, into the computer, which recordsit on the magnetic tape or other input medium. Either method calls for carefulproof-reading in order to ensure the accuracy of the transcription.16.6 The centre box in the diagram represents the processing unit the humanmind or the central processing unit of the computer. The major differencebetween the human mind and the computer central processing unit is that the computer can only do what it is told to do: it has no ability to think or reason or learn from experience, but can only follow a predetermined set of rulesknown as computer programs or software. This is the vital element that turnsthe computer machinery known as hardware into something that canperform a task. Since the computer cannot think, computer programs have to anticipate every possible situation that may arise, and are therefore complicated.16.7 The right-hand box represents the output medium. In human terms,the output may be, for instance, written, spoken or drawn. In the case of a computer the output may be displayed on a visual display unit resemblinga television screen, printed, or delivered in a machine-readable form.APPLICATIONS16.8 Once the texts of Acts of Parliament have been recorded in machine-readable form, they can be put to use through the computer in one or more of several ways.Information retrievalGeneral description16.9 The computers capacity for locating information by recognising wordsis of prime importance to the draftsman. To enable to it do this, it is necessaryto set up, using computer programs, a concordance, or list of all the wordsfound in the text, linked to a master file containing the location references(statute, section number, sentence number, position of word in the sentence)for each word, except very common words such as &quot;and&quot;, &quot;but&quot;, &quot;the&quot;.There are existing computer programs providing a concordance and linkedmaster file which can be used on simple instructions given by an operator.Given suitable instructions (typically, through a keyboard resembling that ofa typewriter), the computer can then almost instantaneously locate and printout, or display on a visual display unit, all the places at which particular wordsor phrases occur in the text. The instructions can be quite detailed: the searchercan specify that he wants one particular word within so many words of another
word, that these must be in a particular order, or that various alternativewords are acceptable; that all words with a particular root are required; andso on. Such a rapid and accurate means of searching existing statute law hasadvantages particularly in connection with the drafting of repeals, amendments,and consolidations.16.10 An example, from Canada, arose out of the replacement of the ExchequerCourt of Canada by the Federal Court. By feeding the words &quot;ExchequerCourt&quot; into the computer it was possible to find, almost instantaneously, all the places where those words appeared in the Statutes and where amendments were therefore required. The alternative would have been for the draftsmanto read all the Statutes or rely on his memory.Updating16.11 It is clear that for the computer to be entirely effective as a tool forsearching statute law, at least all the statute law currently in force must beavailable to it in a form that it can &quot;read&quot;. To achieve this it is necessary not only for the texts of existing Acts to be stored in machine-readable form but also for the text of each new enactment to be added, as soon as may be, to the computer store and, where the new enactment has any effects on existing Acts,for the computer records of those Acts to be updated accordingly. For thelast part of this operation two basic alternatives were considered by the Canadians.The first was a fully-automated system &quot;where the computer takes the old Act,reads the amending Act, and merges them together in the appropriate way&quot;. Itwas concluded that the computer programming involved would be very com-plicated, and that it would still be necessary, as a separate, semi-automated,operation, to alter source references and add notes on sections indirectly affectedby amendments. For the present, the second alternative was therefore chosen:this is a semi-automated system in which &quot;the information is fed in by an operatorwho tells the computer where the amendment is to go&quot;. There are, no doubt,other possible systems: we understand, for instance, that the updating of the computer record of Statutes in Force for printing purposes (see paragraph 16.20)is to be brought about by giving the computer specific instructions, but fedinto it in the form of a &quot;correcting tape&quot; and not manually by an operator.16.12 It is important to appreciate that in Canada the Federal Statutes are normally amended textually by the re-enactment of whole sections or otherunits of text. It appears that with present technology and experience it wouldbe very difficult to set up a fully-automated system to handle textual amendmentby the deletion and replacement of individual words or phrases, and virtually impossible for a fully-automated system to handle amendments effected other-wise than textually.Current and historical files16.13 The updating of the texts of statutes in computer store also involves a choice between maintaining a current file and maintaining a historical file. Acurrent file reflects the state of the law at the date of the latest enactment;repealed provisions, and textually amended provisions in their previous form,are discarded. A historical file retains the old law as well as the new, but takes account of the effects and dates of repeals and amendments and enables thelaw to be searched as at any date, after the commencement of the file, selected
by the searcher. To maintain a historical file would be rather more complex interms of legal analysis, systems analysis and design, and computer programming(though we understand that there would now be no great technical difficulty),and it would require more computer storage than a current file. It would there-fore be more expensive, and has been rejected for the present in Canada, on theground of cost and limited utility.The initial text16.14 The choice between a current and a historical file also has a bearing on the selection of the text to be recorded in the first instance. In Canada, theoriginal computer data base was the text of the 1970 revised edition of theFederal Statutes (which was concurrently printed, from the same magnetictapes, by computer-assisted photocomposition: see paragraph 16.19). Thiswould, of course, have precluded the maintenance of a historical file from anydate earlier than 1970. Here, we recommend that the text of Statutes in force should be used (see paragraph 16.26(5)).A drafting tool16.15 The methods of information retrieval we have described require theuser to possess a terminal-at present either a typewriter terminal or a visualdisplay unit. While in time we may expect draftsmen to have their own terminals,this would not happen quickly and will involve considerable expense. It isworth pointing out therefore that draftsmen can and should in any event be equipped with an essential drafting tool in the form of fully-updated printedmaterial. Obviously the most important printed material for a draftsman is the text of the statutes, followed perhaps by the text of statutory instruments andlocal and private Acts. We return to this theme below (paragraph 16.21).16.16 To the draftsman (especially one who is prepared to acquire, evenimperfectly, the skills of a typist) the computer can offer a number of aids.Where a suitable system has been set up, he can by using a keyboard:put new material on to an input medium, for use by the computer (this can be done by a copy typist);call up for inspection any material already stored in the computer;take material out of store, so that it can be worked on without affectingwhat is in the permanent store;alter the material to be worked while it is displayed on a screen;when the text has been finally got right, instruct the computer to take the revised version into its store;print out any desired passages from the store, and alter the positions of words, sentences, and paragraphs.One draftsman said, after experimenting with keyboard and visual displayfacilities, &quot;this seems an extremely effective way of doing what I myself have always done with pencil and rubber&quot;.16.17 The same draftsman was impressed by the possibilities such a systemoffered for consolidation. He has described the process as follows &quot;The draftsman would first decide the enactments to be included in the(   consolidation, using the search and retrieval facilities. . . He would then
bring all the enactments into working store. This enables him to play aboutwith them without affecting what is in the permanent store. He could then study the enactments using the visual display unit, and very simplydelete the parts that were obviously unnecessary. He would be left withthe bare bones of a consolidation Bill. Having devised a structure for theBill, he would then get the material into the right order (a simple process).Where, as is usual in the United Kingdom, amending Acts had been drafted referentially rather than textually, the consolidator&apos;s most difficult task would then begin. This is the conflation into one text of each originalenactment together with enactments amending it. When ready, he could get a printout of the whole Bill, and of Tables of Derivation and Destination.Obviously, the more the enactments to be consolidated have been amendedtextually rather than referentially, the easier the task of consolidationwill be&quot;.It needs to be emphasised, however, that while the computer can help inassembling and physically manipulating the material to be consolidated itcannot solve any of the basic intellectual problems inherent in the processof consolidation. Whether the Acts to be consolidated have been amendedtextually or referentially, there may be difficult decisions to be made as to thescope and arrangement of the consolidation Act, as to the extent to whichcomparable provisions can be united into a single provision, as to how obscuritiesare to be resolved, as to whether the Acts to be consolidated contain ambiguitieswhich must be incorporated in the consolidation Act, and as to what amend-ments, if any, are necessary to pave the way for consolidation: the list may wellnot be complete. These difficulties require reasoned analysis and decision by the intellectual effort of the draftsman. The computer cannot solve them.In Canada, where (as mentioned in paragraph 16.12) Federal Statutes are nor-mally amended textually by the re-enactment of whole sections or other unitsof text, pure &quot;consolidation&quot; appears to involve little more than the re-printingof statutes as amended. Even so, the computer programming required for a fully-automated process of &quot;consolidation&quot; would be very complicated, andtherefore at this stage a partly-automated system, involving the intervention of an operator, has been adopted.An analytical aid16.18 We would mention, as an interesting idea but one of which any practical application may still be a long way off, the LEGOL project being pursued by Mr R Stamper at the London School of Economics with support from the science Research Council. The aim is to develop a formal &quot;language&quot;, expressedin mathematical and other symbols, into which legislation could be translated(or in which it could be formulated in the first instance), that would enable a computer both to test the logic of the legislative rules and to apply it directly to the facts of a case. The legal department of the Commission of the european communities is understood to be interested in this project because the use of alinguistically neutral formalism might be valuable in expressing law thataffects several nations, and in checking that the logic of the law is the samein each &quot;natural&quot; language. This would facilitate harmonisation. It seems pos-sible that LEGOL might also be valuable in finding, for Anglo-Scottish legisla-tion, neutral terms which would do equally well for both the English legalsystems and the Scottish.
Printing16.19 As well as providing &quot;print-outs&quot;, of low typographical quality, forthe purposes discussed in paragraphs 16.9 onwards, the computer can be usedto assist in the production of printed matter of a quality comparable to thatachieved by conventional &quot;hot-metal&quot; typesetting. The process carried out inCanada was described to us by Mr Skelly in the following terms:&quot;The first stage is that the computer takes the tape, reads it through and locates certain basic codes which it expands into printing codes.This material is then passed to the second stage where the computerbuilds full page width lines . . . The next step is for it to prepare a page.It takes the material in the lines, puts them together, works out wherethe page has to end and builds its pages. Finally it is fed to the photocom-position device which reads the magnetic tape, generates character images,and flashes them onto photographic paper or film, in the form of made-uppages (camera reading copy). Plates are then made and run on an offsetprinting press&quot;.16.20 In this country the new revised edition Statutes in Force is in fact beingprinted by a computer-assisted process. If the same process were also used forprinting Bills, and if the draftsmen&apos;s offices and HMSO were equipped with thenecessary computer terminals, we understand that the draftsman could handin the computer-typeset Bill to the appropriate Public Bill Office. As the Billwent through its Parliamentary stages it would be reprinted with amendmentsby computer typesetting. When it had received Royal Assent, HMSO would addit to the data base, or computer store, of statutes, and it would be printed for publication. (We have discussed in paragraphs 16.11 to 16.13 the questionof updating existing enactments in the computer store that are affected by new legislation.)16.21 It is important that on the passing of an Act not only should its textbe added to the data base of statutes but that any amendments made by it in existing legislation should also be entered in the data base. This would ensurethat users with terminals, when using them to search for and retrieve information,would have the necessary updated text. It is also important however thatusers of the statute book (whether with or without terminals) should be ableto receive the printed text of the new Act, and updated printed versions of otherenactments amended by the new Act, as early as possible.THE PRESENT SITUATION16.22 The public general Acts in force were estimated in 1968 to contain20 million words or 100 million characters. The annual gross increase has beenvariously estimated at between 500,000 and 800,000 words; we have found no estimate of the annual loss through repeals. In terms of computer storage theseare not enormous quantities. Existing disc packs can each store 100 millioncharacters, and later versions will hold 200 million characters. The greater london Council is planning a computer system which will be able to retrieveinformation from 14 of these disc units, holding a total of 2,800 millioncharacters. The statute book if stored in a current file (see paragraph 16.13)would therefore use only a fraction of the capacity of the GLC system, and
could be comfortably housed in a single one of the new disc packs with plenty of room for expansion.16.23 The proportion of legislation in computer storage is at present relatively small, but it is steadily growing. Statutes in Force is, as mentioned inparagraph 16.20, being computer typeset. This can easily provide as a by-product the text of the statutes included in that publication in a machine-readable form suitable for information retrieval. The text of the first instalment of Statutes in Force has in fact been stored by IBM in a data base the retrievalof information from which was demonstrated, to Members and Officers ofboth Houses at the House of Commons during December 1973. The Actsrelating to atomic energy (from the Atomic Energy Act 1946 onwards) havealso been stored in a data base by the Research Group of the United kingdom atomic Energy Authority (&quot;The Status Project&quot;). Apart from these initiativesnothing has been done to provide an information retrieval system for statutorymaterial.16.24 No regular use has so far been made of computers in the preparationof public Bills, or in the Parliamentary processes leading to their enactment.A computer is, however, at present being used by the Parliamentary CounselOffice in the preparation of three public Bills. The apparatus employed createsmachine-readable text, prints it out and duplicates it, and allows manipulationof the text, monitored by a visual display unit. The experiment has not yet beencompleted, and with no assessment of its results available to us our conclusions in paragraph 16.26 about the usefulness of computer systems to the draftsmancan only be tentative.16.25 HMSO, conscious that their present printing capacity is not large enough to meet the expected continuing growth of Parliamentary printingbeyond the next three years, have plans for the substitution of computerisedcomposition for hot-metal typesetting throughout the whole range of Parlia-mentary printing. They have already developed computer composition programswhich would be adapted to a wide range of Parliamentary requirements. More-over, they have appointed a team of four technical staff with computer experience to prepare a systems analysis of the problems. There is as yet no commitment to a computer-based system of printing, but there is a firm, if general, agreementbetween HMSO and Parliamentary officials on the desirability of its introduction,subject to the approval by the two Houses of any necessary alteration in formator procedure. We are satisfied that HMSO have the willingness and expertiseto convert their printing to such a system (which will need to be fully discussed with their industrial staff) and are aware of the immense advantages of such asystem both for the processing of Bills throughout Parliament and for theretrieval of information (statutory and non-statutory).CONCLUSIONS16.26 In the light of the evidence we have received and the material studied by our working group, we have reached the following conclusions, and werecommend accordingly.(1) Computer typesetting would speed up the printing of public Bills atall stages, ie while they are being drafted, during their passage through
Parliament, and at their final enactment. In particular it would makeit easier and quicker for the printer to produce marshalled lists of amendments, and to incorporate those which were accepted in successive reprints. It would also lead to greater accuracy. Finally, itwould make for the ready incorporation of the enacted texts into a comprehensive data base of statute law.(2) We think that the recording of the complete text of the statute book bycomputer and the institution of a system of information retrieval wouldprovide a valuable tool for all those who are responsible for the making of laws. Such a system of retrieval would help Parliamentary drafts-men:(a) to search areas of existing relevant legislation;(b) to find all occurrences of one word, eg &quot;felony&quot;;(c) to achieve completeness in eg repeals;(d) to achieve consistency of drafting language both within a Bill and between a Bill and previous legislation.Further, if the computerised typesetting of Bills were adopted at the drafting stage the draftsmen might make use of the computer as amechanical aid to drafting as well as for research (see paragraphs 16.16and 16.17). In these ways the computer might contribute to accuracyand speed, remove some of the drudgery from the draftsman&apos;s task,and leave him with more time to concentrate upon the centralintellectual problems of good drafting.(3) Such a system of retrieval would also be useful to Members and officers of both Houses of Parliament concerned with the preparation and the amendment of Bills.(4) A system of retrieval would (especially if the data base includedsubordinate legislation) be valuable to all those whose duties may require them to search the statute book: Government departments,local and statutory authorities and the legal professions generally. Inparticular, we would mention the duty of the Government to inform parliament of the impact of European Community legislation upon thestatute book, which on occasion may be a heavy task and require asa preliminary the utmost speed and accuracy in searching the statute book.(5) To provide a system of information retrieval for these purposes itwould of course be necessary for a text of the statutes in a machine-readable form to be prepared, and a concordance and master file setup as described in paragraph 16.9. There would also have to bearrangements for updating this material (paragraph 16.11). We have considered various alternatives based on the text of the third editionof Statutes Revised and subsequent annual volumes, but have rejectedthem as unrealistic. In practical terms, the text used would need to bethat of Statutes in Force, which is already being prepared in a machine-readable form for printing purposes and is expected to be completed within five years and to achieve a high degree of accuracy.
(6) We think that much of the value of an information retrieval system would be lost if updating did not take place very quickly after new legislation had been enacted. If it did not, the results of a computersearch would normally need to be confirmed by conventional research in order to establish that there had been no relevant repeals, amend-ments, or new provisions since the last updating. The annualcumulative supplement to Statutes in Force sets out all the amend-ments affecting each Act as at the end of the year, but cannot in thenature of things be published until more than a year has elapsed since the date of the earliest amendment it contains. Moreover thesupplement is at present typeset by the conventional hot-metal processand therefore could not become part of the data base for an electronicinformation retrieval system. The searcher relying solely on such asystem would thus have at his disposal only the latest revised editionof each statute, and subsequent amendments would not be broughtto his notice. That would not be well suited to the needs of theParliamentary draftsmen. It might therefore be helpful to introduce a system of continual computer-assisted editing: each time anythingoccurred that affected the text of an Act published in Statutes in Force,the editors would record the appropriate corrections through a computer terminal, thus updating the data base so that the informationretrieval system would provide searchers with completely up-to-dateanswers. This constant updating should also make it possible for a newrevised edition of any Act to be produced for Statutes in Force with less expense and effort.(7) The system adopted for Statutes in Force requires that every newly-enacted Act shall be reprinted as soon as possible in the format of statues in Force. If computer type-setting were used for printingQueen&apos;s Printers copies of Acts, so that they were already onmagnetic tape, a great deal of work, cost and time should be saved.If in addition the format of Statutes in Force could be adopted forQueen&apos;s Printers copies, there should be still further savings.(8) A historical file (see paragraph 16.13) appears to us to have significantadvantages over a current file, and we suggest that the system should include one (possibly commencing at 1 June 1972, the effective dateof the first instalment of Statutes in Force) unless this proved to beprohibitively difficult and costly. We understand that the methodshitherto contemplated for the production of Statutes in Force mightnot allow the compilation of a historical file, and that any decision toinclude one in the system should therefore be taken before any of thematerial in Statutes in Force is revised. A compromise that might be worth considering is the &quot;freezing&quot; of the computer text at intervalsas a permanent historical record of what it had been at a particulartime or on a particular occasion. We understand that such a &quot;frozen&quot;text could be stored compendiously and at little expense, though itwould be of limited value as it would serve only those persons whowere concerned with the text as at the dates at which it was frozen,and intervening periods would have to be searched by traditionalmethods.
(9) We hope in any event that the production of Statutes in Force may becompleted by 1980 so as to provide an up-to-date computer-linkedsystem. Such a system would we think benefit the draftsmen in the ways we have described above.(10) The inclusion in the data base of subordinate legislation and, eventually,of case-law would seem to make a retrieval system more valuable notonly to the draftsman, Government departments, and some legislatorsbut also to the legal profession and other non-Government users.Optical character recognition devices (see paragraph 16.5) may havea part to play in converting these materials into machine-readableform without manual transcription.(11) More extensive use of the textual amendment system of amendingActs of Parliament should reduce the amount of editorial work required in the production of Statutes in Force, and assist in ensuringaccuracy, avoiding delay, and reducing costs.
Chapter XVIIFISCAL LEGISLATION17.1 We devote a separate chapter to this subject because it has some peculiarfeatures and some of the heaviest criticism has been directed to it. There isfiscal legislation every year, much of it prepared in great secrecy and undersevere pressure of time, and it directly affects most people. This legislation is complicated and elaborate, because of the often intricate propositions&apos; it hasto express, and the variety of circumstances and conditions in which it falls to be applied and the refined distinctions that it embodies in order to attemptto cater expressly for them. Consequently, despite some fairly recent consolida-tions, the body of tax statutes as a whole is voluminous, and complex in structureas well as in concept and expression.17.2 The problems we discuss in this chapter are not new. They have beenconsidered in the past by other bodies, notably in the reports of the RoyalCommission on the Taxation of Profits and Income (1952-1955)1 and of theDepartmental Committee on Income Tax Codification (1927-1936).2 We refer to these two bodies to whose reports, as will be seen, we are indebted for much of our own analysis as the Royal Commission and the CodificationCommittee respectively.THE LEGISLATIVE SCHEMEPerfect fiscal equity17.3 One reason for the complexity of the ideas and rules to which our taxstatutes have to give expression is the tradition of seeking &quot;perfect fiscal equity&quot; -scrupulously fair tax treatment involving minute differentiation between individual situations. As the Royal Commission put it:&quot;The social and industrial structure of the United Kingdom is intricate.It comprehends a great variety of forms. A master tax, such as incometax has come to be, which has to be applied with fairness to all that variety of forms, must reflect to a large extent the intricacy and complication ofthe underlying structure . . . Secondly, the high rate of tax brings certainconsequences . . . There is pressure for allowances, alleviations andqualifications wherever a special case can be asserted or a distinctionclaimed . . . Moreover, the methods and process of Parliamentary legisla-tion, particularly, perhaps, as applied to the annual Finance Act, themselvesassist in the multiplication of special provisions . . . Perhaps the most formidable single obstacle [to simplification] is the fact that hitherto thetendency both of Parliament and of the Inland Revenue Department hasbeen in the opposite direction. Scrupulous regard has been paid to evensmall differences in individual situation: and, while it is comparativelyeasy to advance from a simple system to a more refined one by introducingqualifications and differentials, it is very much more difficult to retire from a refined system to a simpler one and, by so doing, to ignoredistinctions which hitherto have been recognised and allowed for&quot;.3^md 8761, 9105, 9474.2Cmd 5131, 5132.3Cmd 9474, paragraphs 1085, 1086, 1088.
Having started their inquiry &quot;with an ardent desire to leave the structure andthe conceptions of the tax simpler than we found them&quot;, the Royal Commissionconfessed to having had &quot;only small success in the result&quot; and to having been&quot;led ... on occasions to reject a seemingly attractive simplification&quot;.117.4 The Codification Committee had earlier reached a similar conclusion:&quot;The impossibility of producing a simple code of income tax law must beobvious . . . The countless complications of modern life must inevitably be reflected in the complexity of the code which has to cope with them&quot;.2Anti-avoidance measures17.5 The other main reason for the need to give legislative expression tocomplex ideas and rules is the treatment of tax avoidance. This expressionwas defined by the Royal Commission as follows:&quot;By tax avoidance ... is understood some act by which a person soarranges his affairs that he is liable to pay less tax than he would have paid but for the arrangement. Thus the situation which he brings aboutis one in which he is legally in the right, except so far as some specialrule may be introduced that puts him in the wrong&quot;.3The Royal Commission denied the existence of, and the desirability of introducing, a &quot;general principle that a man owes a duty not to alter the disposition of his affairs so as to reduce his existing liability to tax or,alternatively, for the purpose of or for the main purpose or partly for thepurpose of bringing this about&quot;.4 They concluded that the proper principle was that &quot;the tax avoidance that should be struck at is to be found in thosesituations in which a man, without being in law the owner of income, yet hasin substance the power to enjoy it or to control the disposition of it in his own interest&quot;.517.6 In considering &quot;the kind of measures that the tax system should adoptto correct avoidance&quot;, the Royal Commission found that&quot;The choice seems to lie between the enactment of some general provision which nullifies or controls the effect of transactions that violatethe suggested principle, and the enactment of specific provisions whichidentify with precision the kind of transaction that is to be struck at andprescribe with corresponding precision the consequences that are to followfor the purposes of tax assessment&quot;.6They noted that United Kingdom legislation had in the main followed the second course, whilst in other countries &quot;the usual course is to approach the problemon the lines of some general declaration of principle governing tax avoidance. . . and to leave the application of the principle and the consequential taxadjustments to the decision of a special tribunal, subject in most cases to someappeal to a Court of Law&quot;.7 They also noted, however, a tendency in recentyears to frame anti-avoidance provisions in United Kingdom legislation^md 9474, paragraph 1088.2Cmd 5131, paragraph 23.3Cmd 9474, paragraph 1016.&quot;Cmd 9474, paragraph 1017.5Cmd 9474, paragraph 1019.&quot;Cmd 9474, paragraph 1020.7Cmd 9474, paragraphs 1021-1025.
&quot;in very general terms, so that they were capable of being applied to a much wider range of transactions than those against which the legislation was reallydirected&quot;.1 This tendency they found disturbing:2 their basic recommendation was that there should be no departure &quot;from the present system of detailedlegislative control of the various forms of tax avoidance that are thought to beobnoxious&quot;.3A matter of policy17.7 It has often been urged that there should be a system of &quot;general fiscalequity&quot; (in which it would be accepted that a few people might be overchargedto tax, balanced by a few people undercharged) rather than &quot;perfect fiscalequity&quot;, with or without the enactment of a general anti-avoidance provision whereby any transaction the paramount object of which was the avoidance of tax should have no fiscal advantages. We think, however, that decisions ofthis nature lie in the field of policy, and that our terms of reference confine usto examining what might be done, assuming that fiscal legislation will continueto have to express complex ideas and rules, to achieve greater clarity andsimplicity in its expression and structure.EXPRESSION17.8 The Codification Committee declared that &quot;to expect from us acodification of the law of income tax which the layman could easily read andunderstand was a vain hope, which only the uninstructed could cherish . . .Income tax legislation must, by its very nature, be abstract and technical, and can never be easy reading. It is concerned with principles and methods of calculation which it is difficult to express in words without an appearance ofcomplication&quot;.417.9 The Royal Commission, who considered that &quot;without the assistanceoffered by judicial interpretation, the meaning and effect of the Income TaxActs would have remained obscure indeed&quot;,5 similarly concluded that theexpression of the law on the subject of income tax in statutory form was neverlikely to be intelligible to the ordinary taxpayer, but thought that an effort should nevertheless be made to produce some greater simplicity of expression.8 They were not satisfied that it was impossible to introduce greaterclarity and concision into the drafting of income tax legislation: &quot;we remain under the impression that the possibilities of an improved technique are notexhausted and some advance could still be made in the way of clarity&quot;.717.10 We do not dissent from the Codification Committee&apos;s and the RoyalCommission^ view that the layman is never likely to be able easily to readand understand all fiscal legislation. We accept that over much of this field the legislative audience after enactment is to be regarded as consisting mainly^md 9474, paragraph 1028.2Cmd 9474, paragraph 1029(4).3Cmd 9474, paragraph 1029(1).4Cmd 5131, paragraph 26.6Cmd 9474, paragraph 1087.6Cmd 9474, paragraph 1080.7Cmd 9474, paragraph 1089(5).
of those businessmen, lawyers, accountants, and members of the judiciary who are professionally concerned with the subject, and that to a large extent the objective can only be the limited one of making fiscal legislation more readily intelligible to that audience, from members of which has come mostof the evidence we have received on the subject (we examine below a numberof specific suggestions that they have made). On the other hand many of themore complicated situations dealt with in the legislation are unlikely to occur in the affairs of the great majority of taxpayers, and we think it should bepossible for the basic provisions affecting that majority to be framed in relativelysimple terms, so as to be capable of being understood by them at any rate withthe help of the explanatory material prepared for their guidance by the InlandRevenue.Statements of principle17.11 In a paragraph dealing with &quot;the problem of expression&quot; the RoyalCommission recorded &quot;a preference for clear statements of principle in a brief enactment over detailed attempts to cover by anticipation all imaginableevasions of it&quot; as a line of advance towards greater clarity that had beensuggested to them as worth exploring.1 They did not, however, explicitlycomment on the suggestion, nor indicate how it could be adopted without apolicy decision (which they recommended against) to simplify the ideas andrules to which legislative expression must be given and to abandon the presentsystem of detailed legislative control of tax avoidance. In the circumstances we record our view that in this field, as in others, the attempt to provide in egislation for every foreseeable circumstance can result in very complexprovisions that are not easy for even an expert legislative audience to com-prehend. Furthermore we consider that if Parliament were to state in broadterms in the Act what its intention was, any detailed provisions necessary forgiving effect to that intention would be easier to understand, and we endorse the suggestion that the scope of a charge or relief should be stated clearly ingeneral terms at the beginning of the section or group of sections dealing with it; we recommend accordingly.Mathematical formulae17.12 The Royal Commission accepted as one valid reason why income taxlegislation was difficult and obscure the fact that &quot;not infrequently its con-exceptions represent an attempt to dress what are really mathematical formulaein the vesture of English prose&quot;.2 Several witnesses have suggested to us thatobscurities arising from this source might be reduced if mathematical formulaewere more often expressed as such. This is now an accepted drafting technique,and one of which, with certain reservations, we approve (see paragraph 11.20).Meaning of words and phrases17.13 Witnesses have complained to us about the lack of consistency in theuse and definition of words and phrases in fiscal legislation. Of the examplescited to us, some appear to have been dictated by policy: if for instance, it is decided that &quot;relatives&quot; shall for the purpose of claiming reliefs from tax^d 9474, paragraph 1089(5).2Cmd 9474, paragraph 1089(5)
comprise a wider category of persons than the &quot;relatives&quot; who are to be treatedas a single person in the context of certain company reconstructions, then,unless two different words can be used, different definitions of &quot;relative&quot; forthe two purposes seem to be practically unavoidable (see Income and Corpora-tion Taxes Act 1970, sections 23 and 253(4)). We have been presented with an analysis of provisions concerning groups of companies which demonstratesthe wide variety of criteria that determine, for different tax purposes, whethera company is a member of a &quot;group&quot;: these distinctions also appear to be onesof substance resulting from policy decisions.17.14 On the other hand, there are instances where the differences betweendefinitions of the same expression appear to be purely verbal: the definition of&quot;relative&quot; in section 253(4) of the Act of 1970, cited above (&quot;husband, wife,ancestor, lineal descendant, brother or sister&quot;), seems to be no different in substance from the definition of &quot;relative&quot; in section 303(4) of that Act (&quot;husbandor wife, parent or remoter forbear, child or remoter issue or brother or sister&quot;),and we see no obvious reason for their being differently expressed. The twodefinitions are derived from different annual Finance Acts (1954 and 1965)and occur in provisions dealing with different subjects (company reconstructionsand close companies). The most likely explanation seems to be that the drafts-man&apos;s instructions for the 1965 Act did not draw attention to the existingdefinition in the 1954 Act. We understand that on consolidation in 1970 a deliberate decision was taken not to engage in such tidying-up operations asstandardising definitions, because of the risk of unintentionally changing thelaw and the particularly serious practical consequences any unintended changemight have in the tax field. Though it seems unlikely that the difference would cause any inconvenience to users in the instance quoted above, there may wellbe cases where a purely verbal difference could be confusing. The possibilitycannot be entirely discounted that to change the wording of established defini-tions, on consolidation, might arouse doubts on the part of practitioners whethera change in meaning was not intended; nor can the risk of an unintended changein meaning. But we think the balance of advantage is in favour of standardisation.17.15 It has also been represented to us that expressions used in fiscal legisla-tion the precise meanings of which are important are not always, but ought tobe, defined; examples given were &quot;management&quot; and &quot;error or mistake&quot;.Another criticism made to us concerns the artificiality of requiring references to one expression to be read as including references to other expressions wherethe latter embody concepts that are alien to it in commercial and accountancyterminology and even in the ordinary meaning of our language. The examplegiven was section 467(2)(a) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970:&quot;References [in section 461] to profits include references to income, reservesor other assets&quot;. We do not accept the witness&apos;s suggestion that this exampledemonstrates the draftsman&apos;s ignorance of commercial and accountancy terms.The device seems to us to be a legitimate one, adopted in this instance in orderto avoid further complicating the wording of section 461, though it may bethat some other expression, more apt than &quot;profits&quot; to carry all four meaningswithout artificiality, could have been used.17.16 It has been suggested to us that it would be helpful, both to the draftsmanas an aid to consistency and to the legislative audience, if definitions of expres-sions used in fiscal legislation were standardised (and collected together either
in a new Interpretation Act1 or in a separate part of a new Taxes Act). Whilstin general we think that the use of definitions is a matter for the draftsman&apos;judgment (paragraph 11.15), it does seem to us that there is room for somerationalisation in the fiscal field. Where no difference in meaning is intended,we think every effort should be made to avoid variations in wording whendrafting definitions in new fiscal legislation,2 and to standardise the wording of existing definitions when consolidation provides an opportunity for this to be done. Where different meanings are intended, and an expression is accordingly defined in substantially different terms, for different tax purposes,any degree of standardisation would involve considerations of policy. Weconsider, however, that even where no standardisation of the underlyingconcepts would be acceptable greater clarity might be achieved by purelydrafting means, such as the use, where practicable, of different expressions(rather than the same expression differently defined) or the addition of qualifyingadjectives or phrases, or other distinguishing words; and we so recommend.Precision17.17 We have mentioned in paragraph 17.6 above that the Royal commission were &quot;disturbed by the criticism that much of the anti-avoidance legislation is obscurely worded and drawn more widely that its purpose requires&quot;.3Complaints to the same effect have been made to us. Without conducting an investigation of the substance of current fiscal statutes and the proclaimed orpresumed intentions underlying particular provisions, which we consider tobe outside the scope of our inquiry, we cannot comment on the justice of thesecomplaints.Brevity17.18 We note with some sympathy the view put forward to us that &quot;skilfullycompressed wording&quot; in fiscal legislation could be difficult to understand,and that it would generally be preferable to sacrifice such elegant economy of expression in order to achieve greater clarity, even at the cost of increasedlength. This was coupled with a plea that there should be no increase, but rather a reduction, in the length of sentences, and that if there was any existingconvention that each sentence should be numbered as a section or subsectionit should be abandoned. We do not think that fiscal legislation is in a specialcategory in these respects. We discuss these topics in general terms in Chapter XI.Consultation17.19 Various suggestions, differing in detail, have been made to us to theeffect that drafts of fiscal Bills, or at least of those parts of them that were not of necessity subject to Budget secrecy, should be published before introduction into Parliament, so as to enable the professional accountancy bodies, and others,to draw attention to drafting points and to situations and circumstances thatmight have been overlooked. Such publication might, it was suggested, either be general or take the form of a reference to some advisory body, or both.We think that some such procedure (the possibility of which we discuss moreiSee Chapter XIX, paragraphs 19.4 to 19.11.2 A computerised statute book might help; see Chapter XVI, paragraph 16.26(2).3Cmd 9474, paragraph 1029(4).
generally in Chapter XVIII) might well be particularly useful if applied to fiscallegislation, though particularly difficult because of the intense pressure on thetime and resources available and the requirements of Budget secrecy.17.20 It has been suggested to us that the more detailed provisions of aFinance Bill might be detached from the main budgetary provisions and givenmore leisured scrutiny at another point in the Parliamentary year, possibly by a Select Committee empowered to hear expert evidence. In recent yearsparts of Finance Bills have been taken in Standing Committee. The SelectCommittee on Procedure, in their Second Report for 1970-71, recommendedthat Standing Order No. 40 of the House of Commons should be amended toenable a Bill to be committed in part to a Standing Committee and in part to a select Committee.1 It was, however, envisaged that the two committees would meet simultaneously and that the Bill would be considered as a wholeon report. The recommendation was not confined to Finance Bills, but theview was expressed, in support of the recommendation, that the necessarydistinction between questions of principle and questions of detail had been successfully drawn in proceedings on the Finance Bill in three sessions. TheGovernment accepted in principle that &quot;suitable&quot; Bills or parts of Bills might infuture be committed to Select Committees, but &quot;in view of the additional time that would be required under such a procedure, such Bills would perhaps need to be exclusively of the less urgent kind&quot;.2 We do not think that a furthernew procedure involving reference of parts of the annual Finance Bill to a select Committee is either practicable or desirable. It would not be right to deprive an adequate representation of Members of the chance to vote on the detailed provisions.Correction17.21 It has been suggested to us that there is a need for some procedurethat would enable defects of expression to be rectified, and other uncon-controversial amendments of fiscal statutes to be made, without making demands on parliamentary time. The kind of machinery proposed was a statutory committeeof revenue law experts, which would consider what amendments of this naturewere desirable and formulate them in consultation with the Inland Revenue and parliamentary Counsel; the amendments would be scheduled to the annualFinance Bill and should not be subject to debate. We find this suggestionattractive. The Joint Committee procedure we recommend in paragraph 18.38,for the rectification of defective statutes in general might not be constitutionallyappropriate for fiscal statutes, but we think that it might be practicable tosecure immunity from debate for the statutory committee&apos;s proposed amend-ments if they were certified by the Chairman of Ways and Means as not substantially altering the effect of the statutes to be amended. We recommendaccordingly.STRUCTURE17.22 The Codification Committee held that &quot;the fact that this branch oflegislation cannot avoid being technical and complicated is no excuse forperpetuating its present confused and illogical shape. Rather the contrary.&quot;HC 538, paragraphs 29, 70(12).2HC Deb, 825, c 650.
For the more difficult and elaborate the subject, the more important areprecision and orderliness in its presentation&quot;.1 Two major consolidations offiscal legislation have taken place since that Committee reported, but a high degree of structural complexity remains.Schedules17.23 Witnesses have complained to us that too great a proportion of fiscallegislation is contained in Schedules, and have suggested that all provisionsaffecting taxes payable and reliefs granted should be contained in sections, and only ancillary and supplementary matter in Schedules. A similar view wastaken by the Codification Committee. In describing the plan of their draft Bill,2they said that &quot;it will be observed that the whole untidy apparatus of schedulesand rules has been swept away and all the provisions on each topic have beengathered together . . . and embodied in articulate clauses in the Bill. . . . EightSchedules deal with a variety of special matters (... mostly of an administrativecharacter) with which it was thought better not to encumber the main text ofthe Bill&quot;.3 As we have indicated in Chapters X and XI, we believe that, ingeneral, the inclusion in Schedules of detailed provisions of a permanent kind(provided that their existence is adequately signalled in an enacting section orsections) can be a valuable means of shortening and simplifying the body ofan Act. We do not think that fiscal legislation is a special case in this respect.Amendments17.24 We have already recommended (paragraph 13.20) that where amend-ment of existing legislation is required the system of textual amendment shouldbe applied as generously as possible. It has been proposed to us in evidencethat in the sphere of fiscal legislation that system of amendment should beemployed to the exclusion of all other systems. A necessary prerequisite of putting such a proposal into effect would be a comprehensive and up-to-dateconsolidation of the various branches of revenue law. All changes of the law,whether by way of addition, omission or modification, would then take theform of textual amendment. The law would thus be in a state of &quot;perpetualconsolidation&quot;. As to the proposal itself, we were informed by First Parliamen-tary Counsel that it &quot;involves decisions which the draftsman, left to himself,cannot take&quot; and that the present practice is to employ textual amendment inamending the Income Tax Acts &quot;wherever it produces a convenient result&quot;.17.25 We recognise that there will be many circumstances in which the amend-ment of fiscal legislation by the textual amendment method will not be practic-able. For instance, it may not be practicable to find a suitable place in the text of any existing enactment for the insertion of a quantity of new matter. Butthe volume, frequency and intricacy of fiscal legislation make it, in our view,particularly desirable that changes in this body of statute law should, wherever practicable, be affected by textual amendment rather than by enacting new provisions that the reader must conflate with those of existing enactments inorder to ascertain their combined effect.1Cmd 5131, paragraph 26.2Cmd 5132.3Cmd 5131, paragraphs 27-28.
17.26 We think that too restrictive a view tends to be taken at present of theextent to which it is practicable to amend fiscal legislation by the textualamendment method. Here is a particular instance of non-textual amendment to which our attention has been drawn. Section 188(1)(W) of the Taxes Act of1970 reads as follows:&quot;188. (1) Tax shall not be charged by virtue of section 187 above inrespect of the following payments, that is to say: jjs(d) a benefit paid in pursuance of any such scheme or fund as is described in subsections (1) and (2) of section 221 of this Act (exemptionsfrom charge to tax under the said section 220) or in section 24(1) ofthe Finance Act 1970&quot;.The effect of this provision was altered by section 73 of the Finance Act 1972as follows:&quot;73. The exclusion, by virtue of section 188(l)(c?) of the Taxes Act,of certain benefits from the charge to tax under section 187 of that Act(payments on retirement or removal from office or employment) shall notapply to any compensation paid for loss of office or employment or for loss or diminution of emoluments unless the loss or diminution is due to ill-health; but this section shall not be taken to apply to any payment properlyregarded as a benefit earned by past service&quot;.17.27 It was represented to us on the one hand that this was inconvenientfor the user, who is obliged to conflate the Acts of 1970 and 1972, and on the otherthat the draftsman was right to use this method because a textual amendment would probably have been &quot;cumbersome and difficult to understand&quot;. Wesuggest that the alteration could have been fairly satisfactorily made by textualamendment in either of two ways. The first would have been to alter the text ofsection 188(1)(J) of the 1970 Act, the amending section 73 (of the 1972 Act)taking some such form as this:&quot;73. Section 188(l)(d) of the Taxes Act is amended by adding at theend the words &apos;, except a benefit consisting of compensation paid for lossof office or employment, or for loss or diminution of emoluments, wherethe loss or dimunution is not due to ill-health and the payment is not properly regarded as a benefit earned by past service&apos; &quot;.It may be that the words in section 73 after the semicolon are almost declaratory,and we would accept that that possible flavour of the proposition is not carried over into this textual version.17.28 The second textual method would have been to draw the amendment in substantially the same form as that in which it was in fact enacted, butinsert it into the text of section 188 of the 1970 Act as a new subsection.Section 73 of the 1972 Act would then have read like this:&quot;73. Section 188 of the Taxes Act is amended by inserting aftersubsection (1) the following subsection:&apos;(1A) The exclusion, by virtue of subsection (l)(d) of this section, ofcertain benefits from the charge to tax under section 187 aboveshall not apply to any compensation paid for loss of office or employment or for loss or diminution of emoluments unless the
loss or diminution is due to ill-health; but this subsection shallnot be taken to apply to any payment properly regarded as a benefit earned by past service&apos;&quot;.We believe this amendment has precisely the same effect as section 73 of theFinance Act 1972, though in practice it would probably be supplemented by atextual amendment of section 188(1)(J) of the 1970 Act, inserting a forwardreference to the new subsection (1 A). However, the proposition in section! 88(l)(d)as actually amended, or as textually amended in either of the two ways we havesuggested, remains a chain of no less than four negatives each qualifying what has gone before.17.29 A third theoretically possible method of textual amendment, whichmight have produced a more satisfactory result than either of those so farsuggested, would have been to re-cast the whole of section 188(1)(J) in a form which both effected the amendment and got rid of the negatives; but Parlia-mentary considerations no doubt inhibited the draftsman from consideringextensive recapitulation of this kind.17.30 We recognise that textual amendments may not be particularly helpful to the user of the statutes if he is left to note them up for himself, and that ifthey were more liberally used a frequent reprint service would become evenmore of a practical necessity. Such a service is in fact already provided, for theActs concerning income tax, corporation tax, and capital gains tax, by the inland Revenue&apos;s annual compilation The Taxes Acts. The whole of this com-compilation is re-issued each year, and we think that in the tax field at any ratethis method may be preferable to any loose-leaf or similar system, as theretention of earlier issues by the user can provide him with a convenient meansof ascertaining the law in force in past years, which in practice often has to beapplied.Consolidation17.31 A large body of fiscal legislation was consolidated a few years agobroadly as follows: the principal administrative provisions for income tax,corporation tax, and capital gains tax in the Taxes Management Act 1970;the principal provisions relating to capital allowances in the Capital AllowancesAct 1968; other provisions relating to income tax and corporation tax (includingincome tax and corporation tax exemptions as extended to the capital gainstax but excluding other capital gains tax provisions which extend to thecomputa-tion of corporation tax on chargeable gains) in the Income and CorporationTaxes Act 1970. It will be observed that the consolidation of provisions relatingto the three taxes was not complete: provisions relating to liability to capital gains tax (and to corporation tax on chargeable gains) were not consolidated,and are still to be found in Part III of the Finance Act 1965 as amended.Various transitional provisions also require reference to be made to the earlierlegislation (some of which is not reproduced in The Taxes Acts).117.32 We do not subscribe to the view that fiscal statutes could be kept in astate of &quot;perpetual consolidation&quot; by the use of textual amendment. As wehave said in paragraph 17.25, we recognise that there will be many circum-stances in which the amendment of fiscal legislation by the textual amendment*See paragraph 17.30.
method will not be practicable. Even where amendments of the law are effected by textual amendment of a consolidation Act, a point must inevitably bereached when the original structure of the Act cannot conveniently accommo-date new matter. It is therefore clear that fresh consolidations must from timeto time become a necessity. We note that the Royal Commission recommendedthat there should be a regular consolidation every 10 years,1 and we do notconsider that a more liberal use of textual amendment would necessarilyenable that interval to be lengthened. Nevertheless, it remains in our view amatter for regret that the integrity of the consolidations mentioned inparagraph 17.31 has not been preserved, as far as possible, by casting subsequentlegislation on the subjects with which they deal in the form of textualamendments to them wherever it would have been practicable to do so.Codification17.33 The Codification Committee produced, as Volume 2 of their report,2a draft Bill to codify income tax law as it stood at 31 January 1936; that is tosay, to re-state in statutory form not only the relevant statutory provisionsbut also the judicial decisions by which they had been interpreted. The bill was never introduced into Parliament and the outbreak of war in 1939 put anend to further consideration of it. In 1955 the Royal Commission concluded that the task of codification had by then become even more formidable; theywere not satisfied that a full codification of income tax law was either feasibleor, if feasible, valuable enough to justify the labour involved, for no codifyingstatute would be short or easy to read or to understand.3 Codification of fiscallaw is not a subject on which any evidence has been submitted to us or onwhich we feel able to offer any informed opinion. We make no recommenda-tion, and merely record that we see no reason to dissent from the RoyalCommission^ views.JCmd 9474, paragraph 1089(3).2Cmd 5132.3Cmd 9474, paragraph 1089(1).
Chapter XVIIIPARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE AND SCRUTINY OF DRAFTING18.1 Our terms of reference require us to consider any consequential implications-tions for Parliamentary procedure that may arise from our recommendations for achieving greater simplicity and clarity in our statute law. In looking atconsequential changes in procedure we have also reached some other con-clusions, not necessarily consequential on our earlier recommendations, whichwould in our view facilitate the enactment of simpler and clearer statutes.BILLS AMENDING EXISTING ENACTMENTSShort titles18.2 Several proposals for changes in procedure have been put to us bywitnesses on the ground that they would assist in the preparation of moreintelligible legislation when amendments to existing Acts are being considered.For example, the Statute Law Society suggested that there should be changesin the practice relating to the choice of short titles for amending Bills whichwould assist in&quot;steering the Bill into its appropriate niche in the existing body of statute law and supplement the work of the draftsman in implementing the oneAct, one subject principle&quot;.The Society have particularly in mind the case of composite Bills amendingseveral principal Acts, the short titles of which are usually not very helpful inthis respect. They contend that titles should not be chosen&quot;at random, inconsistently or unsystematically but should be selected bya designated person or body charged with this task and according toprescribed rules&quot;.At present the short title of an amending Bill is chosen by the promoter, havingregard to the general terms and purposes of the Bill. Although we think thatin some cases the short title of a Bill can be misleading, we do not feel that it is practicable for such titles to be chosen by another body as envisaged by theStatute Law Society, and we have already (in paragraph 14.7) expressed ourview that the idea of consolidating the statute book on a &quot;one Act, one subject&quot;principle is fallacious in theory and incapable of being put into practice.Separate amending Bills18.3 Another suggestion put to us by the Statute Law Society to facilitate the arrangement of the statute book on a &quot;one Act, one subject&quot; basis is that where several principal Acts are to be amended together, there should be aseparate amending Bill for each principal Act and a suspension of standing orders (as happens in the Australian Federal Parliament) to permit the relatedBills to be dealt with together. We believe that this practice would involvecomplications which would not be justified, even supposing Parliament wereto agree to the procedure. Furthermore, as we have already said, we do not support the proposal to re-arrange the statute book on a one Act one subjectbasis. We do accept that the practice of introducing amendments to severaldifferent codes in one amending measure (such as a Miscellaneous ProvisionsBill) does cause difficulties for practitioners. These difficulties should howeverlargely disappear with the new edition of Statutes in Force.
BILLS AFFECTING SCOTLANDProcedure to save time on separate parallel Bills18.4 As we have urged in paragraph 12.8, there should be a separate parallelBill for Scotland in all cases where legislation in common with England andWales is required but a combined Bill cannot be drafted in straightforwardterms for both countries. We pointed out in paragraph 12.9 that the enactment of separate Acts applying equally to England and Wales and to Scotland neednot take up as much Parliamentary time as would be required under existingprocedures. The adoption of a procedure on the following lines would, wethink, help to save time. In both Houses the debate on second reading and third reading, if any, would be taken on the English Bill, and the Scottish bill would be given formal readings. For the committee stages in the Commons,each Bill would be taken in its appropriate committee. In the Lords the EnglishBill would be referred to a committee of the whole House, and the ScottishBill would be taken by the committee whose appointment we recommend inparagraph 18.7. The advantages of this system would be that both english and Scottish legislators would be considering &quot;clean&quot; Bills and that the ScottishBill would be committed to a Scottish committee. From the Governmentspoint of view this procedure would use very little more Parliamentary time thana single Anglo-Scottish Bill. Although the second and third readings wouldtheoretically be of the English Bill, speakers who wished could refer to theScottish Bill. If the Bills were altered in their separate committees in such away that they could no longer be regarded as parallel Bills, then they wouldhave to go through the existing procedures for the rest of their stages. Werecommend that further consideration should be given to this proposal.Separate re-enactment of provisions applying only to Scotland18.5 We mentioned in paragraph 12.10 the possibility that there may on occasion be such urgency and shortage of Parliamentary time that it is necessaryto instruct the draftsmen to prepare an Anglo-Scottish Bill which turns out torequire an unacceptable degree of alteration to make it suitable for Scotland.For such Acts there is a procedure which provides for the re-enactment inScotland-only form of those provisions which apply to Scotland. This is done as if the re-enactment were a consolidation, so that the shortened procedureapplicable to consolidation is available. This produces an Act which is acceptable to Scottish practitioners having to consider the legislation after the re-enactmentis published. It does not, however, assist practitioners who need to considerthe Scottish aspect before re-enactment; nor does it assist Parliament duringthe Bill stage of the original Act. A recent example of the use of this procedure is the Land Compensation (Scotland) Act 1973, re-enacted from the LandCompensation Act 1973. We recommend that this procedure should be adoptedwhenever a United Kingdom Act requires substantial adaptation to make itworkable in Scotland, subject to our preference for the speedier proceduredescribed in the following paragraph.18.6 We would prefer, instead of the procedure outlined in the previous paragraph, one that would not have the disadvantage of a delay between the enactment of the Anglo-Scottish Act and the re-enactment of its Scottishprovisions. We have noted a suggestion made to the Kilbrandon Commission
on the Constitution by the Scottish Law commission for a procedure whichwould, reduce the time-lag before the appearance of a Scottish re-enactment.Briefly, this would permit the appropriate Minister, after Royal Assent, to lay before both Houses of Parliament a provisional measure setting forth theeffect of the United Kingdom Act in Scotland. The measure would be referredto a Joint Committee of both Houses, consisting of five Members of the Houseof Lords, including at least one Scottish Lord of Appeal, and five Membersof the House of Commons representing Scottish constituencies, with a quorumof four. The Joint Committee would examine each provisional measure withthe assistance of the Scottish Parliamentary Draftsman, and if satisfied that itaccurately reproduced the Scottish contents of the original United KingdomAct would report that fact to both Houses. Unless either House, within, say,ten Parliamentary days of receiving such a report, otherwise resolved, themeasure would be presented for Royal Assent as if it were a Bill passed by both Houses. On receiving the Royal Assent, the measure would become an act of Parliament and those parts of the original United Kingdom Act super-superseded by the provisional measure when enacted would automatically expire.We prefer this as a speedier alternative to the arrangement described in para-graph 18.5, and we recommend that this proposal, or something similar, shouldbe adopted.Scottish legislation in the House of Lords18.7 We recommend that the House of Lords should appoint a committee towhich Scotland-only Bills could be committed at the committee stage. Wethink that this would make for better and more detailed discussion of these bills than is practicable on the floor of the House, and this in turn would help to achieve greater simplicity and clarity in Scottish Bills. The House of Lords,which is widely regarded as a revising chamber, would also benefit from havingamongst its members a minister who is a Scottish lawyer, as was the case in1969 when the Lord Advocate was created a Life Peer. Scottish Peers felt thatthis enabled them to improve the content and clarity of amendments dealtwith in the House of Lords. We recommend that as a standard constitutional practice there should be a Scottish lawyer, whether or not a Law Officer, includedin the ministerial team in the House of Lords.TERRITORIAL EXTENT18.8 Shortly after we were appointed, the Lord President of the Councildrew our attention to a Question he was asked in the House of Commons on21 May 1973 by Mr Donald Stewart, Member of Parliament for the WesternIsles, about the indication given in the titles of Government Bills as to theirterritorial extent. Mr Stewart asked if the Lord President would make it ageneral drafting practice to make clear in the titles of Government Bills towhat country they referred. We have considerable sympathy with Mr Stewartand with others in Scotland, and in Northern Ireland, who wish to knowfairly quickly when looking at an Act whether any of it applies to the law withwhich they happen to be concerned. There are two distinct problems here,one relating to the long title and one to the short title.Commission on the Constitution, Written Evidence, Vol 5, Scotland (HMSO, 1972), p 30,paragraph 9.
In the long title of the Bill18.9 So far as the long title is concerned, the rule of the House of Commonsis that the scope of a Bill is limited to a particular part of the United Kingdomif, but only if, such a limitation is written into the long title. The rule applieseven if the limitation is only implicit, as when the title is framed by referenceto an Act which does not extend to the whole of the United Kingdom. Becauseof this rule, the committee on the Bill cannot entertain an amendment toextend the Bill beyond the part of the United Kingdom to which it is limited.The rule can however be abrogated if the House agrees to an instruction to thecommittee, and the House will usually not object to such an instruction. the implications of references in the long title to particular legislation may howevereasily be overlooked.18.10 The rule may sometimes work in favour of the Government in that itmay prevent the moving of amendments to extend the Bill; but it is just as likely to inconvenience Ministers if they find that they wish to extend the Billby amendments in committee. The draftsman will naturally be careful not to expose the Government to the risk of this inconvenience, even though it wouldbe easy to get the House to agree to the necessary instruction. If therefore hesuspects that the Bill may need to be extended by amendments in committee,he will avoid importing into the long title any territorial limits which mightnecessitate an instruction. We do not think that any discouragement shouldbe placed in the way of the draftsman from expressing the territorial limits of bills clearly in their long titles, and we therefore recommend that this rule ofthe House of Commons be abolished.In the short title of the Bill18.11 The problem of identifying the territorial extent of statutes in theirshort titles, which we think it is more probable Mr Stewart had in mind whenhe asked his Question, though not a procedural point, might also be dealt withhere. There is no difficulty of course about identifying Acts which apply solely to Scotland. With a few exceptions these are already plainly distinguishedby the use of the expression &quot;Scotland&quot; in their short titles, as in the Crofters(Scotland) Act 1955. The same practice applies with Acts relating only to northern Ireland. The trouble arises with Acts applying only to England andWales, which carry no distinguishing expression in their short titles. We donot think there is any practical reason why they should not do so, and just asit is helpful for English readers to see at a glance from the short title of a&quot;Scotland only&quot; Act that they need read no further (nor indeed get a copy ofthe Act), so Scottish and Northern Irish readers would be helped by corres-ponding guidance in the short titles of Acts affecting only the law of Englandand Wales. We therefore recommend accordingly.18.12 Where the law of only one law district is excluded from the applicationof an Act it is more difficult to show the extent in the short title withoutclumsiness, but no one has suggested that this should be attempted, and we make no recommendation on this point.18.13 To some extent the Editorial Board of Statutes in Force have met this problem by printing the initial letters &quot;UK&quot;, &quot;EW&quot;, &quot;S&quot; and &quot;NT at the bottom right hand corner of the title page of each Act printed in that edition.
The letters are intended to be primarily a guide for purchasers, but they areno doubt of assistance to users. A similar practice might be found useful ifapplied to Bills in Parliament and to Acts as printed by the Queen&apos;s Printer,and we recommend that an experiment be made on those lines.In the body of the Bill18.14 Finally, there is the question of territorial extent clauses within theBill itself. An extent clause is needed only in order to negative the normalpresumption that an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom (or aparticular provision of such an Act) extends to the whole of the UnitedKingdom. It is not needed, and with one exception is not used, in order toindicate that an Act does extend to a particular part of the United Kingdom.The exception is that for some years it has been usual to include in a Bill whichis to extend to Northern Ireland an express provision declaring that it does soextend. The reason for this was the existence of the separate legislature inNorthern Ireland. It has been suggested to us that a similar practice should beadopted with regard to Scotland, so that the practitioners and the publicthere can find in each Act an express statement that the Act, or any particularprovision of the Act, does or does not extend to Scotland. We think this proposal could usefully be considered, though we doubt if it could or should be adopted as an invariable rule. There is much to be said for including a clearly-statedextent clause whatever the present rule may be and we recommend that such a clause should ordinarily be included in Bills. Where in any Act the extent of aparticular section is different from the extent of the Act as a whole, this shouldbe indicated in a side note to the section. The effect of these proposals wouldbe to assist users of the legislation in England, Wales and Scotland. No pro-cedural questions would be involved unless it were decided to promote theextent clause from the end of the Bill to the beginning, and this propositionwe now consider.THE POSITION IN BILLS OF COMMON-FORM CLAUSES18.15 We have received evidence from a number of users of the statutes thatit would be convenient to have certain general provisions placed at the beginningof the Act rather than at the end where they are at present usually to be found.These common-form provisions deal with extent and commencement, shorttitle and citation and interpretation. It is argued that logically the properplace for them in an Act is at the beginning, because the reader cannot fullyunderstand it until he has learned which expressions have special definitions.In a Bill they are rightly placed at the end, since it is wrong to consider howparticular expressions are to be defined, which clauses should or should not extend to Scotland, or when different piovisions of the Bill should come intoforce before deciding what expressions are to be used, what clauses are to stand part of the Bill, and what those clauses are to say. This antagonism betweenthe logical and the procedural arrangement might be reconciled if these clauseswere placed at the beginning of a Bill but postponed until the Bill had beengone through in committee. The postponement would have to be formallymoved and there would be a risk of a division at the very beginning of a con-controversial Bill on a minor point of procedure before the principles of the bill had been expounded to Parliament. The Parliamentary draftsmen have therefore
normally adhered to the practice of placing common-form clauses at the endof Bills, and this is where most regular users of the statutes have long been accustomed to look for them.18.16 There are disadvantages in changing the present practice of placingcommon-form sections at the end of the statute. From the point of view of theuser it is a switch from one convention to another which cannot affect existing acts. The user would therefore be faced with two different modes of arrange-ment, and we do not suppose that he would welcome this or that it would makeit easier for him to understand the Acts he needed to consult, ft might also tendto discourage the valuable drafting practice by which the main provisions ofthe legislation are formulated early in the Act. Although the reader certainlyneeds to grasp the meaning of the definitions and terms used in the statutebefore he can fully understand it, he is more likely first to require a general statement of the policy which the statute is putting into effect. The process of understanding is then refined by reference to the detailed provisions containedin later sections, in the common-form sections and in the Schedules.18.17 Recent experience in Northern Ireland has helped us to reach a view on the question whether common-form sections should be promoted to thebeginning of Acts. During the period of Direct Rule, when Orders in Councilreplaced Acts of the Stormont Parliament, the Northern Ireland draftsmenadopted the practice of inserting the short title and interpretation provisionsat the beginning of the Order. This is the usual practice with statutory instruments, and the draftsmen considered that this was a more logical arrange-ment. The change-over from Orders in Council to Measures of the NorthernIreland Assembly which took place in 1974 gave the draftsmen an opportunityof reviewing the practice. They concluded that although there was a greatdeal to be said in favour of promoting the common-form clauses to thebeginning of Measures, any benefits which might result would be outweighed by the disadvantage that the practice would be out of step with Westminsterlegislation. Current Northern Ireland law would have included Measureswhere common-form provisions appeared at the beginning and Westminsterstatutes where they appeared at the end. This would not have been a satisfactory arrangement, and so they went back to the practice of placing the extent,commencement and other common-form provisions at the end of their Measures.In considering the same point in relation to Westminster legislation we toohave reached the conclusion that the existing practice should not be disturbed.We do not believe it Makes very much difference to the ease with which Actscan be read whether the common-form provisions are placed at the beginningor the end of the statute; but since the latter practice is so well established achange now might cause more confusion than would be justified by the possible advantages of a more logical arrangement.PROPOSALS TO LIMIT DEBATE ON CLAUSES IN THECOMMONS18.18 Many of our witnesses have expressed a preference in favour of shortersections, and we have therefore considered whether the present rule that in committee each clause can be debated on a motion that it shall stand part ofa Bill has an adverse effect on the intelligibility of our legislation by disposing
the draftsman to frame clauses which are longer than they should be, therebyhelping to reduce the opportunities for debate and the time taken on the Bill.The present rule is subject to the qualification that the chairman of thecommittee has a discretion to prevent discussion on clause stand part if theprinciple of the clause and any matters arising thereon have already been adequately discussed during debate on amendments to the clause. If the rulewere to be altered so that a clause automatically stood in the Bill unless a specific amendment had been put down to remove it, would this lead to animprovement in drafting?18.19 One of the objectives in the drafting of a Government Bill is to limit the opportunities for lengthy debate when there is intense political oppositionto a measure, euphemistically described as &quot;close scrutiny of government legislation&quot;. If the present rule were to be altered in the manner suggested inparagraph 18.18, it is to be expected that in a situation of &quot;close scrutiny&quot;amendments would be put down to leave out nearly every clause. It would therefore be necessary for the chairman to have a discretion not to call suchamendments if the principle of the clause had already been sufficiently debatedor if the content of the clause did not warrant discussion. The selection of amendments to leave out a clause could not be decided on in advance of the debate on the amendments to the clause itself, and one would be back to thepresent situation with the difference that there would be no debate unless theamendment was selected. We doubt therefore whether the suggested amendmentof the rule would make any practical difference. Whichever form the rule takes,a decision to chop up a long Bill into a given number of clauses will have precisely the same effect.18.20 We do not believe that the present rule is so harmful to good draftingpractice as it might appear to be, or that a change in the rule would of itselfmake it easier to draft shorter clauses. It is clear to us from a review of recentlyenacted legislation that there is in any event now a tendency in favour ofshorter clauses, and it has presumably been possible to draft Bills in this waywithin the constraints imposed by the existing rules and procedure. We do not therefore consider that any change is required in the present rules and practicerelating to debates on &quot;clause stand part&quot;. We have noted that the SelectCommittee on Procedure of the House of Commons have considered proposals to limit debate on clauses when Bills are in committee and have rejected them.SOME MINOR PROPOSALS18.21 First Parliamentary Counsel has drawn our attention to certain con-straints imposed by Parliamentary practice which may be a hindrance to the draftsman in the preparation of legislation, and has proposed a number of changes. His proposals are only indirectly relevant to the subject of our inquiry;but, to the extent that any changes in practice would reduce the load on the draftsman after a Bill is introduced and give him more time to concentrate onessentials, we are glad to give them our support.Jeg Sixth Report from the Select Committee on Procedure 1966-67 (HC 539), paragraph 24.127
Italics to show financial provisions18.22 The first suggestion is that the practice, with Bills introduced in the commons, of printing in italics provisions relating to financial expenditure should be discontinued. When these Bills are reprinted, the italics are dropped and the text has to be rechecked, with consequent slight risk of introducingprinting errors. The practice serves little or no purpose since there is already an account of the financial effects of such Bills in the Financial Memorandum.Moreover, the italics are not a reliable guide to passages which need to be confirmed by a money resolution before they are debated in committee. first parliamentary Counsel has suggested that there should be no italics in Govern-ment Bills as introduced in the Commons. We agree with this proposal andwe so recommend.Form of amendments to Bills18.23 The form of amendments to Bills differs in the House of Commons forcommittee and report stages. The form in the House of Lords differs from both.It would save time and trouble for those concerned with legislation if practicewere made uniform in both Houses. We agree that there is a strong case forharmonising the lay-out of amendments for both Houses and consider thatthe method used in the House of Lords has advantages over that used in theHouse of Commons. We recommend that there should be consultation betweenthe two Houses with a view to submitting agreed proposals on this subject.Numbering of new clauses18.24 When a Bill has new clauses added to it the resultant renumbering of clauses and internal cross-references can be time-consuming and is a possiblesource of error. First Parliamentary Counsel has suggested that new clausesshould be given temporary numbers (for example 7A, 7B, Schedule 2A) whichwould make it unnecessary to renumber and would allow everyone to continueto refer, throughout the passage of the Bill, to the original clauses by their original numbers. The Bill could be renumbered in correct sequence when theproof Royal Assent copy was being prepared. This is an attractive suggestion,but it would not be practicable in present circumstances because of the furtherrisk of error which a complete renumbering of clauses would entail at the royal assent proof stage, and the delay that would occur before the general publicationof an Act to allow renumbering to take place. However, as progress is madewith the use of computers in the processing of Bills through both Houses, nodoubt ways will be found of speeding up the task of renumbering so that it willbe possible to do this much more quickly and accurately before Royal Assent.We recommend that the possibility of carrying out the entire renumberingprocess at this stage should be looked at again when the application of com-puter techniques to the preparation of, legislation has been developed to agreater extent.Abolition of Consolidated Fund and Appropriation Acts18.25 Annual Consolidated Fund and Appropriation Acts are at presentneeded to give effect to Supply Resolutions of the House of Commons. first parliamentary Counsel has suggested to us that there would be a significant reduction in the annual flow of legislation reaching the statute book if theseconstantly recurring enactments were to be abolished. In recent years there have
been three short Consolidated Fund Acts and one 50-page Appropriation Actannually. We agree that it is undesirable to place the ephemeral details of theGovernments annual expenditure on the statute book if this can be avoided,and we recommend that some other method should be devised to give effect toSupply Resolutions. We have noted that the Select Committee on procedure of the House of Commons did not favour a proposal to dispense with theseActs when they reported on financial procedure in 1965-66.1 We hope that theSelect Committee might be prepared to review their decision in the light of the considerations which have led us to make the recommendation in this paragraph.It would of course be necessary to provide the Commons with an alternative means of seeking redress of grievances before the granting of supply.SCRUTINY OF DRAFTING18.26 There is at present no formal machinery for the scrutiny of Bills during their passage through Parliament to examine their form and drafting ratherthan the substance of the policy to which they are to give effect. various suggestions have been put to us that there should be some such scrutiny. Inapproaching these proposals we have kept in mind that they could involveextra work for the Parliamentary draftsmen, whose resources are already fullyextended, and that scrutiny would take up time which would not be recovered at other stages. Nevertheless, we have come to the conclusion that it should bepossible to devise means which would permit the scrutiny of Bills for drafting totake place without imposing undue strain on the existing legislative process, andwe make certain recommendations to this end in subsequent paragraphs.Scrutiny before presentation   118.27 Several witnesses have suggested that the scrutiny of the drafting of bills should take place before they are presented to Parliament. proposals we have considered are that this scrutiny should be carried out by standing orad hoc committees of experts qualified to make a contribution, by the LawCommissions and by the Cabinet itself. (Such pre-presentation scrutiny is to be distinguished from the proposals to make use of pre-legislation committeesrecommended by the Select Committee on Procedure of the House of commons in their Second Report for 1970-712 and accepted in principle by the thenGovernment in November 1971). We find it difficult to reach a firm view onthese suggestions, partly because our terms of reference do not permit us toexamine the processes of Government that take place before a Bill is presented to Parliament. We assume that any Government wishing to make its proposed legislation as intelligible as the subject permits will have regard to the import-ance of good drafting. The Government have a collective responsibility for this,and Ministers in charge of particular Bills are personally responsible for the drafting of their Bills and answerable to Parliament if they do not reach accept-able standards.18.28 It has been suggested that the Law Commissions should be asked toadvise on the drafting of Bills before they are presented to Parliament (and indeed after presentation). Although the Commissions assist in some of thepre-Parliamentary preparation of legislation by producing reports and draft law*HC 122, p ix, paragraph 14.2HC 538, paragraph 9.
reform Bills, by drafting consolidation, statute law revision and statute lawrepeals Bills, and by advising Ministers on particular legal points arising inconnection with departmental Bills, they are independent bodies and should notbe expected to take any general responsibility for advising on the drafting of departmental Bills before they are presented to Parliament.18.29 In his evidence to us, the Chief National Insurance Commissionersuggested that a standing conference should be appointed to keep social security law (which is entirely statutory) continuously under review in orderto identify provisions which did not work well and to propose possible improvements. One of the functions of this standing conference would be toassist in the preparation of social security legislation with the object of ensuring that Bills were arranged in a clear, logical order. This suggestion led us toconsider whether similar standing committees might have a contribution tomake to the drafting of complex legislation in other fields. We have concluded that it must be left to Government departments themselves to decide whatadvice they should seek before presentation from advisory bodies on the drafting, as distinct from the substance of Bills.Scrutiny during passage through both Houses18.30 Some witnesses have suggested to us that each Bill should pass through a stage in the Parliamentary process during which it would be scrutinised by acommittee concerned solely or primarily with the form in which the Bill isdrafted. Lord Simon of Glaisdale expressed the following view on the subject:&quot;With regard to Parliamentary review of drafting, it seems to me to be only intermittently performed. There is a natural concentration on policy,even at committee stage. Moreover, Parliamentary time tends to be exhausted and Parliamentary energies to flag before Schedules are con-sidered; and these often contain provisions of considerable importancecouched in a particularly baffling form. Such a function is best performed by a Select Committee or a Joint Select Committee&quot;.A similar suggestion is also made by the Statute Law Society and by theaccountancy bodies who were&quot;strongly of the opinion that discussion of proposed legislation bySelect Committees was likely to improve not only the substance of legis-lation but also its technical quality&quot;.A variant on the proposal for scrutiny by a Parliamentary Select Committeefavoured by some other witnesses would be scrutiny by the Law Commissions,possibly working in association with experts on the subjects from outside theGovernment service. The Society of Public Teachers of Law considered that:&quot;a carefully integrated contemporaneous or parallel vetting processneed not delay or obstruct parliamentary progress on a Bill&quot;.18.31 Our witnesses recognised that the proposal for a separate stage inParliament to scrutinise the drafting of Bills would create additional work forthe officials and draftsmen. Indeed, Lord Simon of Glaisdale recommendedthat his proposed Select Committee should:&quot;where appropriate, work in parallel with a committee of officials, andshould in any event have a standing counsel&quot;.
Not only would there be extra work for the officials, and the Ministers, handling the Bill, there would be an additional burden on Parliament itself. Lord Simonof Glaisdale suggested that one way of mitigating the load on parliament and at the same time speeding the passage of legislation would be to substitute a &quot;scrutiny of drafting&quot; stage for one of the existing stages. His proposal wasthat the scrutiny of drafting stage should replace the report stage in the secondHouse. In his view this would postpone the consideration of drafting pointsuntil the latest possible stage before the third reading of the Bill in the secondHouse. Lord Simon argued that one of the functions of the report stage is in any event to allow drafting improvements to be introduced. The other functionscould be provided for by permitting amendments on third reading in the Houseof Commons (as is already permissible in the Lords) to give effect to under-takings given in committee.18.32 Not all witnesses agreed with the view that there should be a separatestage during the passage of a Bill through Parliament devoted to the scrutiny of drafting, however desirable this might be. The Society of ParliamentaryAgents pointed out that:&quot;Any public Bill which does not complete all its stages by the end of the session must fail. While this continues to be the practice of Parliament,it is doubted whether the time could be spared to enable a panel or acommittee of experts to consider the drafting of a Bill, particularly if itwere a contentious one. Furthermore, it is a common-place that draftingin committee nearly always produces disastrous consequences. It is sub-mitted, with all respect, that a panel or committee of experts, be theynever so distinguished, would not in the circumstances be more likely toproduce a workmanlike result than the original draftsman&quot;.First Parliamentary Counsel in his evidence to us was naturally very much concerned with the burden of additional work which a scrutiny committeewould impose upon the draftsman, to the possible detriment of other necessarywork. He cautioned that when ideas were put forward:&quot;which in themselves are no doubt well worth consideration but makeassumptions as to resources and time available . . . there may be somethingelse better that you could do with the resources&quot;.18.33 Having weighed the arguments on both sides, we do not think that thereis any practical scope for introducing a new scrutiny stage during theParliamentary process. This would in our opinion impose undue strain on a parliamentary machine which is already under great pressure, and would alsoadd to the labours of the draftsmen who have more than enough to do as it isto keep pace with the legislative programme.Intervals between stages of Bills18.34 On some occasions there is too little time between the various stages of a Bill to permit Members of Parliament, Peers and those whom they consultto give adequate consideration to the drafting of the proposed legislation andthe framing of amendments. This problem is especially acute between the end ofthe committee stage and the start of the report stage, especially on Bills of substantial length and complexity. No doubt the Parliamentary draftsmen also
find themselves at a disadvantage when there is insufficient time between stages.We therefore recommend that, unless there is a need for special urgency, thereshould always be at least (a) two week-ends between the first publication of a Bill and the debate on second reading in the first House;(b) fourteen days between second reading and the start of the committee stage;(c) on all Bills of considerable length or complexity, fourteen days betweenthe publication of the Bill as amended in committee or standingcommittee and the start of the report stage.Scrutiny after the Parliamentary process18.35 Some Acts reach the statute book in defective form, and it would often be a simple matter to remove blemishes if expeditious procedures were availablefor doing so. There are two situations to consider. First, there are occasions whenobvious examples of inaccurate drafting come to light just before a Bill receivesthe Royal Assent. Secondly, there are Bills which could well be rearranged andtidied up after Parliament has finished with them so that they are more fit togo out into the world and be of help to those who must use them. We have thefollowing proposals for dealing with these two situations.18.36 There is usually very little time to spare for the correction ofinaccuracies after a Bill has passed through both Houses and before royal assent, so any correcting action would need to be most expeditious.We recommend that a procedure should be available by which the speaker and the Lord Chancellor would certify, on application by the sponsor of aBill, that amendments which came within a narrowly defined category (ofwhich obvious inaccuracies in drafting would be one) would, if incorporated in the Bill, constitute improvements of a drafting nature. The proposed amend-ments would be printed on the Order Paper with the requisite certificate, and parliament would be given the opportunity to accept or reject them, taken together and not individually, without debate.18.37 The scrutiny of Bills which had passed through the Parliamentaryprocess with a view to improving arrangement and drafting could be under-taken in less haste, though the need for expedition here also would be paramount.Where there was some lapse of time between the passage of the Bill and royal assent this type of scrutiny could well take place before Royal Assent. Inmost cases, however, it would take place after Royal Assent, and theprocedure would then be similar to the consideration of Consolidation Bills bythe Joint Select Committee on such Bills. The task of rearrangement andredrafting would of course need to -be undertaken by the draftsman of theBill and we realise that this would impose a burden on the Parliamentarydraftsmen. We put the proposal to First Parliamentary Counsel and hisestimate was that the time it would take a draftsman to deal with a medium-sized Bill of about 50 pages would be three weeks. A Bill of 150 pages wouldtake six weeks to knock into shape. Even though it would not be necessary tosubject all Bills to this revision, there would be a tendency at the end of eachSession, when many Bills are ready for Royal Assent, for them to be bunchedtogether, and this would further delay the despatch of the work.
18.38 Despite these difficulties, which we have not underestimated, werecommend that a procedure should be available whereby Bills, or Acts as thecase may be, which are found to be obscure or otherwise defective in point of form could be rewritten (in whole or in part) in clearer language and re-enactedwithout using much Parliamentary time. We think that a procedure on thelines of that applicable to Consolidation Bills would be appropriate. Thus aBill &quot;to re-enact with formal improvements [section ... of ] the [. . .] Act&quot;would be introduced in the House of Lords and automatically be referredto a Joint Committee, who would report, either that they were satisfiedthat the Bill contained only formal improvements or that they were not so satisfied. If the Joint Committee reported favourably, the Bill wouldthen enjoy the expedited procedure which is now available to ConsolidationBills. It might even be possible for the Joint Select Committee on ConsolidationBills to take on this task in addition to their other work if their order of reference were extended.General scrutiny of legislation for drafting18.39 Even if the two procedures which we recommend above were madeavailable, we believe that there should also be a general and continuing over-sight of legislation with the aim of achieving long-term improvement in standards of drafting, and in the arrangement of the statute book. We con-sidered whether responsibility for this should be given to a Joint Select Committeeof both Houses, but decided that it would hardly be possible for such a com-mittee to undertake the detailed and continuing supervision which would berequired. In any case, some of the tasks which we should like to see carried outare presently being performed by the Statute Law Committee (see paragraphs 5.1to 5.4), which exercises a very healthy, expert and well-informed (though littlepublicised) oversight of public and private Bill legislation generally.18.40 We recommend that the Lord Chancellor should arrange for theStatute Law Committee to keep the structure and language of the statutes under continuous review. We further recommend that the Committee should review the carrying into effect of those recommendations in our Report, which are accepted, in particular our recommendation in paragraph 13.20 with respectto the use of textual amendment.18.41 We believe that Parliament should be kept regularly informed ofthe Statute Law Committee&apos;s progress. That Committee does not publishreports on the activities for which it is responsible. We think that it should now do so, but that the intervals between such reports should be sufficientto enable it to review trends and tendencies in drafting practice over a fairlybroad space of time. We therefore recommend that the Committee should publish reports from time to time, but not less often than every three years,and that these reports should be laid before Parliament. The publication of such reports would give Parliament the opportunity and the incentive to question the Government about the technical quality of their legislation.CONCLUSION18.42 Parliamentary procedure and practice do have a bearing on theform and style of our legislation, and it is right that this should be so in viewof the part which Parliament plays in the making of laws. When we
approached our task we were pre-disposed to recommend any changes whichmight conduce to the simplicity and clarity of the statute law as it reachesthe user; and we would not have hesitated to recommend that alterationsshould be made had we thought they were needed. As will be evident, however,we have not tracked down many procedures which require to be changed.There are sound reasons for the procedures of Parliament and our view is thatthese should not be altered unless it can clearly be demonstrated that it wouldbe beneficial to do so. Apart from the recommendations we have made forthe Parliamentary scrutiny of drafting to which we attach great importance,and some minor recommendations, we have come to the conclusion that noother changes of substance in procedure would improve the clarity andsimplicity of legislation. The way in which procedures may be used can howeversometimes cause trouble, and when the drafting of Bills becomes defectivebecause of the application of a procedural rule, however innocently this mayhave happened, the Government (and indeed Parliament itself) have a clearresponsibility to set matters right.
Chapter XIXINTERPRETATION OF STATUTESTHE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INTERPRETATION ANDDRAFTING19.1 In 1969 the Law Commissions published a joint study of the rules applied by the courts when dealing with the interpretation of statutory provisions.In paragraph 5 of this study the Commissions stated that &quot;there is an interactionbetween the form of a communication and the rules by which it is to be interpreted. If defects in drafting complicate the rules of interpretation, it isalso true that unsatisfactory rules of interpretation may lead the draftsmanto an over-refinement in drafting at the cost of the general intelligibility of thelaw&quot;. We fully agree with this statement; and the same theme was touched on by certain of our witnesses in discussion with us. Lord Simon of Glaisdalesuggested that &quot;a robust and not too technical an approach to construction&quot;was necessary if statutes were to be drafted in popular language. Lord Denningroundly said: &quot;It is because the judges have not felt it right to fill in the gaps andhave been giving a literal interpretation for many years that the draftsman hasfelt he has to try and think of every conceivable thing and put it in as far as hecan so that even the person unwilling to understand will follow it. I think therules of interpretation which the judges have applied have been one of the primary causes why draftsmen have felt that they must have a system of over-detail, over-long sentences, and obscurity&quot;. But he also thought that if parliament initiated the change, the judges might follow it up: &quot;if the draftsmancould make Acts simpler, the judges would alter their approach to them ... Itcould be done by breaking up the form of the statutes, by making them simpler,sticking more to the principles, and not going into so much detail&quot;.19.2 If the draftsmen are to be encouraged to cut down upon detail andelaboration and to use simple formulae in the operative words of Bills, theymust have some confidence that when the Bills become Acts they will receive from the courts a beneficial construction (see Maxwell on Interpretation of statues, 12th edition, page 92). We see no reason why the courts should notrespond in the way indicated by Lord Denning. The courts should, in our view,approach legislation determined, above all, to give effect to the intention ofParliament. We see promising signs that this consideration is already uppermostin the minds of the members of the highest tribunal of this country. &quot;If i thought that Parliament^ intention . . . could not be carried out, or even wouldbe less effectively implemented, unless a particular (even though unnatural)construction were placed on the words it has used, I would endeavour to adoptthat construction&quot;. So said Lord Wilberforce in a recent appeal (Nimmo vAlexander Cowan &amp; Sons Ltd. [1968] A.C/107 at 130). While there might notbe complete agreement with the proposition that an unnatural constructionmay be placed upon words simply to secure a higher degree of effectiveness inthe implementing of Parliament^ intention, yet the passage well illustrates the modern attitude towards construction of a remedial statute. In the same case,Lord Guest (at p. 122) indicated that, where there was doubt, the constructionto be preferred was that which would best achieve the result to be attained.xThe Interpretation of Statutes (Law Com No 21) (Scot Law Com No 11).
If this is to be the judicial approach it follows that the Parliamentary intentionmust be made sufficiently clear and this can, in our view, best be done by theadoption of the &quot;general principle&quot; approach in the drafting of statutes as wehave recommended in Chapter X (paragraph 10.13).19.3 Because of this interaction between drafting and interpretation (and inparticular the influence the latter has on the former) we think it right to consider in the context of our own terms of reference the proposals which the LawCommissions put forward for the enactment of certain statutory rules of interpretation. This we do in paragraphs 19.12 to 19.31 of this chapter. Alsoin this chapter we consider whether the interests of clarity and simplicity mightbe furthered by (a) a modernisation of the Interpretation Act 1889, which enacts certain general conventions for the interpretation of statutes (paragraphs19.4 to 19.11);(b) the enactment of a presumption against retrospective effect (paragraph19.32);(c) the more frequent use in individual statutes of preambles or other provisions declaring the main purpose of the statute in question or particular provisions of it, and the giving of &quot;controlling&quot; force tosuch provisions (paragraph 19.33); and(d) the enactment of special rules for the interpretation of european community Treaty provisions and instruments which have legal effect in this country without further enactment, and of United kingdom legislation implementing Community Treaty provisions and instru-ments which do not have such effect (paragraphs 19.35 to 19.39).A NEW INTERPRETATION ACT?19.4 A general Interpretation Act can help to shorten and simplify particularActs of Parliament, to clarify their effects by enacting rules of construction, andto standardise common-form provisions. The Interpretation Act at presentin force is of 1889, and we consider in the following paragraphs whether it nowneeds to be replaced, bearing in mind that, although it has stood the test of time,it is a long time since it was enacted. The Act has been amended and supple-mented by subsequent enactments, some of which were retrospective.19.5 Leaving aside for the moment the question of enacting the new provisionsproposed by the Law Commissions in 1969 and the new provision aboutretrospection that we recommend in paragraph 19.32, there is a strong case for the re-enactment of the Act of 1889 in up to date terms.19.6 The case for doing so is substantially the case for any consolidation.Various provisions of the Act have been amended or superseded by subsequentenactments, and others have become obsolete with the passage of time. In the address to which we have already referred1 Sir William Graham-Harrisonsaid in 1935 that the time had undoubtedly arrived for a new InterpretationAct. Some 40 years later, it might be thought to be overdue. Out of 20 institutions^ee paragraph 11.28.
comprised in the &quot;Official definitions&quot; (section 12) something over half have dis-appeared as such. Almost all the &quot;Judicial definitions&apos;&apos; (section 13) are obsoleteor irrelevant. The Poor Law (section 16) is no longer with us. Most of the &quot;Geo-graphical and colonial definitions&quot; (sections 18 and 18A) should have been blown away by the wind of change. On the other hand a fair number ofexpressions have been defined generally by enactments passed since 1889. Alist of such enactments (which may, however, not be comprehensive) is given inthe Index to the Statutes under &quot;ACT OF PARLIAMENT 2(b)&quot;.19.7 A former First Parliamentary Counsel, Sir John Rowlatt,1 thought thatthere should only be one Interpretation Act: the public should not have to lookin more than one place (outside the enactment which they are considering)for general provisions affecting the construction of that enactment. This was an argument against any new Interpretation Act; but, by now, with so manygeneral definitions outside the Act of 1889, it almost turns into an argument atleast for consolidation. The problem of applying the provisions of a newInterpretation Act to existing enactments is complex but not insuperable. the choice would be between a new Interpretation Act which applied both to existing and to future enactments and a new Interpretation Act which applied to futureActs only, leaving the Act of 1889 and other statutory definitions in force inrelation to previous enactments. Whichever alternative were chosen, if allsubsequent definitions of general application were fed into the new InterpretationAct by way of amendment, preferably textual, and if a suitable system ofannotating and reprinting the new Act were adopted, the user of the statute book would find his task considerably simplified.19.8 So much for the definitions in the Act of 1889 (and elsewhere). Theremaining provisions of the Act, mainly designed to shorten subsequentlegislation, are as good as new. Those mainly relied on are section 1 (masculineincludes feminine; singular includes plural and vice-versa); section 11(1)(non-reviver of repealed enactments by repeal of the repealing enactment);section 19 (person); section 20 (writing); section 26 (service by post); section 32(statutory powers and duties); section 36 (commencement) and section 38(general savings on repeals). This is not to say that all these provisions areperfect. In particular section 32(3) (power to revoke and amend subordinate legislation) does not apply to all subordinate legislation and has to be regularlysupplemented by special provision in Acts conferring power to make orders:and section 38(1) is ambiguous and possibly defective. There are other provisions which are repeated from Act to Act and might usefully be eliminated by inclusion in a new Interpretation Act notably the incantation that &quot;References in thisAct to any other enactment are references to that enactment as amended byany subsequent enactment&quot;, which is probably unnecessary but cannot safely be omitted because it has been said so pften.19.9 The Interpretation Act (Northern Ireland) 1954 is more comprehensivethan the Act of 1889. It runs to 51 sections compared with 43. Some of theadditional material is peculiar to the context of legislation by the Parliamentof Northern Ireland (for example section 11(3)). Some of it states expresslyrules of construction or presumptions which apply to Acts of the Parliament1First Parliamentary Counsel 1953-56.
of the United Kingdom but rest on the common law and are not enacted as such(eg non-application to the Crown,1 enactments to be construed as alwaysspeaking). Such provisions do not shorten or simplify the language of theActs to which they apply they merely clarify their effects. However, theNorthern Ireland Act also contains a number of common-form provisions not included in the Act of 1889, eg section 18, tenure of holders of offices; section 21,power to make rules of court; section 22, powers of appellate courts; and section23, inquiries and investigations. These enactments have no doubt done much to shorten particular Acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland at the cost, as mr. William Leitch observed in 1965,2 of concealing some of the substance fromthe reader of individual Acts. He claimed that without the Act of 1954 &quot;theannual volumes of the Northern Ireland Statutes would, upon a conservative estimate, be approximately one-third larger than they are&quot;. We should not expect any such spectacular results from similar extensions of the Act of 1889in the field of United Kingdom legislation, but the possibility of enacting some such common-form provisions in a new Act could usefully be considered.19.10 Finally, the Northern Ireland Act also contains some general provisions which would have useful, though not dramatic, effects on the statutes of the parliament of the United Kingdom if enacted here. One of these replaces theincantation described at the end of paragraph 19.8. Another eliminates therepetition of words such as &quot;of this Act&quot;, &quot;of this section&quot;, and &quot;of this schedule&quot;. A third deals with the computation of periods of time, and soeliminates such ponderous expressions as &quot;the period of 30 days beginning with [the passing of this Act]&quot; which are necessary but no doubt contributesomething to the general dislike of statutory language. The enactment of general provisions of all these kinds in an Interpretation Act would have three advan-tages. They reduce (however little) the volume of subsequent enactments. Theyeliminate some mystery. And not least they reduce inconsistencies between different Acts. As matters stand the incantations described in paragraph 19.8vary from Act to Act. The reasons for this may be valid, but are not apparentto the public. Different techniques of internal references abound eg &quot;section 4of this Act&quot;, &quot;section 4 below&quot;, &quot;the next following (or succeeding) section&quot;.Different methods are used to make it clear whether a period includes orexcludes the first or last day, and the need to do so is sometimes overlooked.Every provision which is standardised in an Interpretation Act plays a valuablepart in facilitating the task of the draftsman and easing the burden on thereader.19.11 In the light of all these considerations we believe that the case for anewInterpretation Act is extremely strong. The initiative for the preparation ofsuch an Act lies with the Law Commissions, though as they have pointed out&quot;The revision of the Act [of 1889] is a task which of its nature closely involves the Parliamentary draftsmen and is dependent on their available manpower&quot;.3Subject to that, we recommend that the preparation of a new InterpretationAct should be put in hand.&quot;This presumption is not universal: in Scotland, at least in relation to some categories oflegislation, there is no inherent unlikelihood that it is Parliaments intention to bind theCrown.H6 Northern Ireland Legal Quarterly, p 236. Mr Leitch was until recently First ParliamentaryDraftsman at Stormont.aThe Interpretation of Statutes, paragraph 82.
THE LAW COMMISSIONS&apos; PROPOSALS19.12 We readily accept the Law Commissions&apos; statement of the constitutional position of the judiciary:&quot;Under our constitutional arrangements it is the function of an independ-ent judiciary to interpret the law and no proposals which we make can or should undermine the freedom which this function requires&quot;.1The Commissions nevertheless concluded that a limited degree of statutoryintervention was required in this field,2 and formulated a set of draft clauses,printed as Appendix A to their report. We consider these below, subject to asimilar caveat.Draft clause 119.13  Draft clause 1(1) would provide as follows:&quot;In ascertaining the meaning of any provision of an Act, the matters which may be considered shall, in addition to those which may be con-sidered for that purpose apart from this section, include the following,that is to say &quot;,and there follow five paragraphs which we now consider separately.19.14 &quot;(a) all indications provided by the Act as printed by authority,including punctuation and side-notes, and the short title ofthe Act&quot;.Judges have told us that they agree with this, and that to some extent it repre-sents current practice (except as regards side-notes). First Parliamentary Counsel,supported by officials of Government departments concerned with the prepara-tion of legislation and, independently, by the Law Society, takes the oppositeview, at any rate as regards punctuation and side-notes. They fear that para-graph (a) might lead to punctuation being regarded as part of the text and soalterable only by amendment; that the words &quot;the Act as printed by authority&quot;would include successive revised editions where side-notes may have been changedas a matter of editing; that it would be dangerous to alter the degree of signific-ance to be attached to side-notes originally drafted on the assumption that theywould not carry much interpretive weight; and that for the future draftsmenmight be induced by this paragraph to produce longer and generally lesshelpful side-notes. Nevertheless we agree with the Law Commissions&apos; proposal:see paragraph 19.21 below.19.15 &quot;(b) any relevant report of a Royal Commission, Committee or other body which had been presented or made to or laid beforeParliament or either House before the time when the Act waspassed&quot;. ^The main objection advanced against this paragraph is that it cannot be assumed that a report or other travaux preparatoires will tell you what Parliament hadin mind when discussing and passing the Act (if paragraph (b) were enacted,the issue before a court might well be the extent to which the Act was intendedto depart from the report); it could also be difficult to decide in every case whatwas a &quot;relevant report&quot;, since the paragraph would seem to admit referencesl77ie Interpretation of Statutes, paragraph 79.&quot;Ibid, paragraph 81. \\
to any report that could be shown to be relevant, no matter how long beforethe passing of the Act concerned it was made. Judicial witnesses, however,were generally in favour of this paragraph, and regarded the present law as tothe status of these reports as unsatisfactory. We do not agree with this proposal:see paragraph 19.23 below.19.16 &quot;(c) any relevant treaty or other international agreement which is referred to in the Act or of which copies had been presented toParliament by command of Her Majesty before that time, whetheror not the United Kingdom were bound by it at that time&quot;.Objections by witnesses to this paragraph include the lack of any time limit for &quot;relevant&quot; material; the frequent inclusion in treaties, in order to resolveinternational differences of policy, of deliberate ambiguities which the draftsmanof the Act may have been instructed to resolve in a certain way; and the difficultyin which litigants and their advisers would be placed by the words &quot;whether ornot the United Kingdom were bound by it at that time&quot;. Lord Denning, however,approved of paragraph (c), regarding it as consistent with the present practiceof the Court of Appeal and indeed as &quot;inescapable&quot;. We accordingly agree withthe Law Commissions&apos; proposal: see paragraph 19.22 below.19.17 &quot;(d) any other document bearing upon the subject-matter of thelegislation which had been presented to Parliament by command of Her Majesty before that time&quot;.This has been objected to on the grounds that an Act resulting from a white paper often diverges from it both in outline and in detail, for the aims of theWhite Paper may have been different from the aims of Parliament in passing the legislation; that there would in any event be a temptation to couch white papers in terms designed to provide the courts with overriding principles by reference to which ensuing legislation was to be interpreted; that if a documentsuch as a White Paper was to be published shortly before or at the same time asthe introduction of a Bill, the need to ensure that the one was as precise as theother in legal (as distinct from political) effect would increase the burden on the draftsman and the Government department concerned; and that since para-graph (d) would be retrospective, it again raised the question whether documents,such as White Papers, written under one set of rules should in future be looked at under different rules. The judicial views put forward to us on paragraph (d)range from an unqualified welcome to the conclusion expressed with &quot;regret&quot; that from a practical and professional point of view it is too wide. We do not agree with this proposal: see paragraph 19.23 below.19.18 &quot;(e) any document (whether falling within the foregoing paragraphsor not) which is declared by the Act to be a relevant documentfor the purposes of this section&quot;.It has been suggested to us that paragraph (e) is unnecessary, since it goeswithout saying that any Act can declare a particular document to be relevantfor the purpose of interpreting the Act, and undesirable because by servingas a reminder of that fact it might encourage the moving of amendmentswriting documents including even Hansard into the Act. It was rightl;--suggested that clause 1(3), to which we refer below, could not override a specific provision in a particular Act which declared a report of proceedings in
Parliament to be relevant to the construction of the Act. A further difficulty towhich our attention has been drawn is that if an Act declared under para-graph (e) that one document falling within paragraphs (b) to (d) was relevantthe relevance of other documents falling within those paragraphs might by implication be called in question. We think paragraph (e) may be superfluous,but that Parliament should exercise its existing power with restraint: see paragraphs 19.23, 19.24 and 19.26 below.19.19   Draft clause 1(2) would provide that:&quot;The weight to be given for the purposes of this section to any suchmatter as is mentioned in subsection (1) shall be no more than is appropriate in the circumstances&quot;.Witnesses who are critical of the draft clauses have commented that clause 1(2)is an acknowledgement that much of the material admitted by clause 1(1)would be of doubtful value, or little weight: &quot;much research and labour mayhave been spent to little purpose&quot;. We agree, however, with this proposal:see paragraph 19.25 below.19.20  Draft clause 1(3) seeks to exclude Hansard, in the following terms:&quot;Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorising the con-sideration of reports of proceedings in Parliament for any purpose forwhich they could not be considered apart from this section&quot;.We have already (in paragraph 19.18) noted that this provision would notoverride the kind of provision contemplated by draft clause l(l)(e) (documentsdeclared by the Act to be relevant). Our witnesses have been almost unanimous in saying that reports of Parliamentary debates should not be admissible,though Lord Simon of Glaisdale&apos;s view on this was a qualified one, which hehas since expressed in the following terms in his speech in Dockers&apos; LabourClub and Institute Ltd. v. Race Relations Board [1974] 3 W.L.R. 533:&quot;It would be one thing to cite debates in Parliament to help to ascertain the general objective of an Act and the general limitations on such objective this would be using the debates to identify the &apos;mischief&apos; which theAct seeks to remedy ... It would be quite another thing to have recourse to reports of debates to see whether any understanding was expressed asto the meaning of the statutory language as related to particular situationsnot statutorily identified. It might be yet a third thing if any such under-standing so expressed contradicted the meaning of the statutory language&quot;.We have discussed in Chapter X (paragraph 10.7) Lord Simon&apos;s suggestion for mitigating the effect of the exclusion of Parliamentary debates for thesecond of the purposes he mentions in this passage. We agree in principle withthe Law Commissions&apos; draft clause 1(3): see paragraph 19.26 below.Conclusions on draft clause 119.21 We recognise the force of the objections mentioned in paragraph 19.14,but consider that the balance is nevertheless in favour of admitting the &quot;indica-tions&quot; mentioned in draft clause l(l)(a). We do not recommend any departure from the existing practice whereby punctuation and side-notes are not amendablein Parliament, and we assume that in applying the new principle judges wouldhave regard to that practice.
19.22 &quot;There is a prima facie presumption that Parliament does not intend to act in breach of international law, including therein specific treaty obligations; and if one of the meanings which can reasonably beascribed to the legislation is consonant with the treaty obligations and another or others are not, the meaning which is consonant is tobe preferred.&quot;1Moreover, where there is cogent extrinsic evidence of a connection between an international treaty and an Act under interpretation, a court may look atthe treaty in elucidating the Act, even though the Act does not mention thetreaty.1 On the other hand, where it is the clear intention of Parliament to enacta law which is in any respect inconsistent with the provisions of a treaty towhich Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom is a party, the courtswill give effect to that intention.2 We agree with the current judicial attitudes,which attach high importance, in the construction of legislation, to the terms of treaties which may be relevant to that legislation. In spite of the objections noted in paragraph 19.16, we think that clause l(l)(c), with clause 2(b), provides a useful restatement of those judicial attitudes. See, however, paragraph 19.39below.19.23 We appreciate that there is a difference of judicial opinion as to theextent to which such materials as are referred to in clause l(l)(b) and (d) areat present admissible as aids to interpretation.3 We think, however, that theunrestricted admission of such materials would place too great a burden onlitigants and their advisers, and indeed on the courts, and would create even greater difficulties for lawyers trying to advise their clients before a specificcontroversy had arisen. It would certainly do nothing to make statutes moreimmediately intelligible to the lay public, and it might greatly lengthen courtproceedings. From the draftsman&apos;s point of view it seems at least possible thatthe desire for greater precision in order to avoid any possible ambiguity arisingfrom comparison with these extensive materials would produce more ratherthan less complicated provisions. We consider, therefore, that it would be preferable to leave it to Parliament, if it saw fit, to declare in the Act thatspecified material outside the Act (and not admitted by clause l(l)(c)) shouldbe admissible for the purpose of interpreting it. But since it is in any casepossible for Parliament to do this, we doubt the value of clause l(l)(e).19.24 Although in Chapter XV we make certain recommendations about thepublication of specially prepared explanatory materials, we think that ingeneral such materials should not be declared to be admissible for the purposeof judicial interpretation. To do so would be to create what Professor ReedDickerson has called a &quot;split-level statute&quot;, of which only the primary level would have been fully debated in Parliament, and would, as a distinguishedmember of the judiciary put it, be asking the courts &quot;to ride two horses, toconstrue technical draftsman&apos;s language and layman&apos;s language&quot;.19.25 We think that draft clause 1(2) is a helpful clarification and should beincluded.1Salomon v. Commissioners of Customs and Excise [1967] 2 QB 116.2See Ellerman Lines v Murray [1931] AC 126, and Lord Denning&apos;s explanation of that casein Corocraft Ltd v. Pan American Airways Inc. [1968] 3 WLR 1273, at p 1281.3See Black-Clawson International Ltd v Papierwerke Waldhof-Aschaffenburg AG as reportedin The Times, 1 March 1975.
19.26 We strongly support the principle of draft clause 1(3), and favour itsenactment if the rest of the clause is to include anything whatever which could put that principle in the slightest doubt. Our misgivings about the unrestrictedadmission of pre-legislative materials (paragraph 19.23) apply a fortiori to the admission of the records of Parliamentary proceedings on the Bill; though we recognise that it would be possible for Parliament to declare these to beadmissible (whether or not draft clause l(l)(e) were enacted), we would stronglyurge that this should never be done.Draft clause 219.27 Draft clause 2 turns from aids to interpretation to principles of inter-pretation, and would provide as follows:&quot;The following shall be included among the principles to be applied in the interpretation of Acts, namely(a) that a construction which would promote the general legislativepurpose underlying the provision in question is to be preferred to aconstruction which would not; and(b) that a construction which is consistent with the international obligations of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom is to be preferred to a construction which is not&quot;.Clause 2(a) has been criticised on the ground that the rule expressed may notbe the right one, in that it might be the general legislative purpose of the Actthat should be favoured rather than the purpose &quot;underlying the provision in question&quot;. Doubt has been expressed as to whether this principle should in any event be elevated at the expense of others such as the liberty of the subject(in the context of criminal proceedings) and the need for clear words to make aman part with his money (in taxing statutes). On the other hand it has beensuggested that clause 2(a) &quot;is little more than a re-phrasing of the old &quot;mischiefrule&quot;, which is probably . . . evolving in the desired direction without the needfor statutory intervention&quot;. Clause 2(a) was, however, welcomed, at any ratein principle, by more than one of our judicial witnesses. Clause 2(b) has notattracted explicit comment from witnesses, although there were several passingreferences to it.Conclusions on draft clause 219.28 Clause 2(a) is, as we understand it, in part a codification of modernpractice in the application by the courts of the so-called &quot;mischief rule&quot; of statutory interpretation. We agree with the emphasis placed on the positive&quot;general legislative purpose&quot;, which is an expression well chosen to apply toall types of legislation. Clause 2(b), in combination with clause l(l)(c), provides a useful restatement of the substance of recent judicial pronouncements (seeparagraph 19.22). We are in favour of enacting draft clause 2 as a whole.Draft clauses 3 and 419.29 Draft clause 3 would apply clauses 1 and 2 to subordinate legislation and so is outside our terms of reference. We therefore express no opinion on it.
19.30 Draft clause 4 would raise a presumption that breaches of statutoryduties imposed by future Acts were intended to be actionable. This we thinkinvolves considerations of substantive law which are outside our terms ofreference, and so on this too we express no opinion.General conclusion on Law Commissions&apos; proposals19.31 We believe that acceptance of the Law Commissions&apos; proposals to theextent indicated in paragraphs 19.21 to 19.28, and subject to a further pointwe make in paragraph 19.39 about European Community instruments, wouldenable statutes to be drafted more clearly and simply. We accordingly recommend the early enactment of a suitably modified version of the Commissions&apos; draftclauses. These might usefully form part of the comprehensive revisedInterpretation Act we recommend in paragraph 19.11.OTHER PROPOSALSRetrospective legislation19.32 The difficulties that may be encountered by the courts in determining whether legislation has retrospective effect lead us to recommend that thefollowing principle should be given statutory effect:&quot;In the absence of any express indication to the contrary, a constructionthat would exclude retrospective effect is to be preferred to one that wouldnot&quot;.As with the Law Commissions&apos; proposals (see paragraph 19.31), this could usefully form part of a comprehensively revised Interpretation Act.&quot;Controlling&quot; provisions19.33 We have discussed in paragraphs 11.6 to 11.8 the use of statements of purpose as an aid to the understanding of statutes. It has been suggested to us not only that Acts should contain preambles or other provisions declaringthe main purpose of the Act, or its &quot;guiding principles&quot;, but that these should govern the construction of the more specific and detailed provisions of theAct in all cases (and not only where there is doubt about the meaning of thelatter), and should prevail over them where there is a conflict. In particular,it has been suggested that preambles could with advantage be used for thispurpose. The present rules as to the use of preambles in the interpretation of statues are, as we understand the matter, these:(1) In cases where the effect of a substantive provision in an Act is clear from the terms of the Act itself, then recourse may not be had tothe preamble for the purpose of interpreting the provision.(2) Where the effect of a provision is not clear from the terms of theAct itself, recourse may be had to the preamble to ascertain the intentions of Parliament.We are not convinced that an alteration of these rules so as to enable a preamble to control an enactment which is in itself clear and precise would be productiveof any advantage. On the contrary, it might lead to confusion.
Disregard of prior case law19.34 At present the draftsman has to bear in mind the common law andthe interpretation placed by the courts on earlier statutes. It was suggested to us that in appropriate cases there should be put in the statute an indication that former case law was no longer to have any authoritative effect, thus givingthe draftsman a freer hand and leaving the courts free to approach interpretationin a new way having regard only to the spirit of the Act. Whilst this had afavourable reception from one judicial witness, another expressed doubts about its practicality. We think the suggestion is an interesting one but thatit has such far-reaching implications for the doctrine of precedent as to beoutside the proper scope of our inquiry.THE EUROPEAN INFLUENCE19.35 Part of the law applicable in the United Kingdom now comes, directly or indirectly, from the European Communities, through the Treaties them-selves and subordinate instruments made under the Treaties by the Communityinstitutions. A Community regulation is &quot;directly applicable in all member states&quot;1 without any intervention by any national law-making agency (thoughit does not necessarily have direct effect for individuals in the sense of creatingrights and obligations enforceable within the national legal system, as forinstance where it is merely a regulation enabling further regulations to bemade). A directive (which is &quot;binding, as to the result achieved, upon each member State to which it is directed, while leaving to national authorities the choice of form and methods&quot;1), and a decision (&quot;binding in its entirety upon those to whom it is addressed&quot;1), may call for the enactment of nationalimplementing legislation, but may, it seems, have direct effect for individualseven without such legislation, as may articles of the Treaties themselves.219.36 Section 2(1) of the European Communities Act 1972 provides asfollows:&quot;All such rights, powers, liabilities, obligations and restrictions fromtime to time created or arising by or under the Treaties, and all such remediesand procedures from time to time provided for by or under the Treaties,as in accordance with the Treaties are without further enactment to begiven legal effect or used in the United Kingdom shall be recognised and available in law, and be enforced, allowed and followed accordingly;and the expression &quot;enforceable Community right&quot; and similar expressionsshall be read as referring to one to which this subsection applies&quot;.Section 2(4) of the Act of 1972 provides inter alia that:&quot;any enactment passed or to be passed, other than one contained in thisPart of this Act, shall be construed and have effect subject to the foregoing provisions of this section&quot;.^EC Treaty, Article 189; EURATOM Treaty, Article 161. The terminology of the ECSCTreaty is not identical,but there are similar distinctions between the effects of different categories of instruments.Wan Gend en Loos v.

19.37   Section 3(1) of the Act of 1972 provides as follows:&quot;For the purposes of all legal proceedings any question as to the meaningor effect of any of the Treaties, or as to the validity, meaning or effect ofany Community instrument, shall be treated as a question of law (and, ifnot referred to the European Court,1 be for determination as such inaccordance with the principles laid down by and any relevant decisionsof the European Court)&quot;.19.38   Where a Treaty provision or a Community instrument has legal effect in the United Kingdom without further enactment, we believe that the effect ofthe provisions we have quoted will be to secure that it is interpreted in accord-ance with the principles of interpretation which would be followed by theEuropean Court. As Lord Denning said in HP Bulmer Ltd vJBollinger SA2:&quot;it is apparent that in very many cases the English courts will interpret theTreaty themselves. They will not refer the question to the Europeancourt at Luxembourg. What then are the principles of interpretation to beapplied ? Beyond doubt the English courts must follow the same principlesas the European court. Otherwise there would be differences between thecountries of the Nine. That would never do. All the courts of all ninecountries should interpret the Treaty in the same way. They should allapply the same principles. It is enjoined on the English courts by section 3of the European Community Act 1972, which I have read.What a task is thus set before us! The Treaty is quite unlike any of the enactments to which we have become accustomed. The draftsmen of ourstatutes have striven to express themselves with the utmost exactness.They have tried to foresee all possible circumstances that may arise and toprovide for them. They have sacrificed style and simplicity. They haveforegone brevity. They have become long and involved. In consequence,the judges have followed suit. They interpret a statute as applying only tothe circumstances covered by the very words. They give them a literalinterpretation. If the words of the statute do not cover a new situation which was not foreseen the judges hold that they have no power to fill the gap. To do so would be a &apos;naked usurpation of the legislative function&apos;:see Magor and St. Mellons Rural District Council v Newport borough council [1952] AC 189, 191. The gap must remain open until Parliamentfinds time to fill it.How different is this Treaty ? It lays down general principles. It expressesits aims and purposes. All in sentences of moderate length and commendablestyle. But it lacks precision. It uses words and phrases without definingwhat they mean. An English lawyer would look for an interpretation clause,but he would look in vain. There is none. All the way through the Treatythere are gaps and lacunae. These have to be filled in by the judges, or by regulations or directives. It is the European way. That appears from thedecision of the Hamburg court in In re Tax on Imported Lemons [1968]CMLR 1.&quot;The Court of Justice of the European Communities has jurisdiction to give preliminaryrulings concerning the interpretation of the Treaties and the validity and interpretation of acts of Community institutions; national courts are enabled, and a final national court is required,to refer any such question to the Court of Justice in any case where the national court considersa decision on the question to be necessary to enable that court to give judgement: e.c. Treaty,Article \11;H P Bulmer Ltd. v / Bollinger SA [1974] 3 WLR 202, [1974] 2 CMLR 91.2[1974] 3 WLR202, at p 215.
Likewise the Regulations and directives. They are enacted by theCouncil sitting in Brussels for everyone to obey. They are quite unlikeour statutory instruments. They have to give the reasons on which theyare based: article 190. So they start off with pages of preambles, &quot;whereas&quot;and &quot;whereas&quot; and &quot;whereas&quot;. These show the purpose and intent of theRegulations and directives. Then follow the provisions which are to beobeyed. Here again words and phrases are used without defining theirimport. Such as &quot;personal conduct&quot; in the Directive 64/221, article 3(e.c.) which was considered by PennycuickV-C in Van Duyn v HomeOffice [1974] 1 WLR 1107. In case of difficulty, recourse is had to thepreambles. These are useful to show the purpose and intent behind it all.But much is left to the judges. The enactments give only an outline plan.The details are to be filled in by the judges.Seeing these differences, what are the English courts to do when theyare faced with a problem of interpretation ? They must follow the Europeanpattern. No longer must they examine the words in meticulous detail.No longer must they argue about the precise grammatical sense. Theymust look to the purpose or intent. To quote the words of the Europeancourt in the Da Costa case [1963] CMLR 224, 237, they must deduce&quot;from the wording and the spirit of the Treaty the meaning of the com-munity rules&quot;. They must not confine themselves to the English text. Theymust consider, if need be, all the authentic texts, of which there are noweight: see Sociale Verzekeringsbank v Van der Vecht [1968] CMLR 151.They must divine the spirit of the Treaty and gain inspiration from it.If they find a gap, they must fill it as best they can. They must do what theframers of the instrument would have done if they had thought about it.So we must do the same. Those are the principles, as I understand it, onwhich the European court acts&quot;.19.39 Where, however, a Treaty provision or a Community instrument doesnot have legal effect in the United Kingdom without further enactment butrequires to be implemented by United Kingdom legislation, questions may arise as to the manner in which that legislation is to be interpreted. To assist thecourts in resolving such questions we make two recommendations. First,we&apos;recommend that any United Kingdom legislation intended to implement a Treaty provision or a Community instrument should contain a clear statement that it is so intended. Secondly, we recommend that it should be made clearthat in such a case the courts may, in construing the United Kingdom legislation,take into account the relevant provisions of the Treaty or other instrument towhich that legislation is intended to give effect. This would involve enactingthe Law Commissions&apos; draft clause l(l)(c) in a somewhat wider form than thatin which it is at present cast.GENERAL CONCLUSIONS19.40 We do not consider that any question of using the courts to fill ingaps should logically arise from the simpler drafting which we are recommending.The problems will be those of limiting and defining the application of the broad general rules stated in the Act. We do not for a moment suppose thatthe courts of the United Kingdom would approach legislation drafted in theway we recommend in the spirit of attempting &quot;to pull the language to pieces
and make nonsense of it&quot;.1 On the contrary we are sure that they would apply the principle contained in draft clause 2(a) of the Law Commissions&apos;clauses (to which we have already referred in paragraph 19.27) that a con-struction which would promote the general legislative purpose is to be preferred to one which would not.19.41 We conclude that interpretation of Acts drafted in a simpler, less detailed and less elaborate style than at present would present no great problemsprovided that the underlying purpose and the general principles of the legislation were adequately and concisely formulated. The real problem is one of con-fidence. Would Parliament be prepared to trust the courts? We refer again tothe evidence given to us by Lord Emslie and Lord Wheatley:&quot;It is probably the case that legislation in detail is resorted to becauseParliamentarians harbour the suspicion that judges cannot be trusted togive proper effect to clear statements of principle. This, with respect tothem (the Parliamentarians), is wholly unfounded&quot;.&apos;See the judgement of Denning L J (as he then was) in Magor and St Mellons Rural DistrictCouncil v Newport Borough Council [1950] 2 All ER 1226, at p 1236.
Chapter XXSUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS20.1 In Chapter I of the Report we discuss the scope of our task and the way we set about it. In Chapters II to V, as a background to our enquiry, we give a brief account of the present machinery for the preparation and publication oflegislation, and of its historical development; and in Chapters VI and VIIwe analyse the problems as we see them and discuss the factors to be taken intoaccount in suggesting remedies. We now summarise briefly the main conclusions reached in the remainder of the Report. Recommendations involving some change in the existing system, whether of law or practice or only of emphasis,are indicated by an asterisk.20.2 The Government promotes and drafts virtually all the legislation that parliament enacts. There is therefore a joint responsibility for the conditionof our statute law as well as for the volume and scope of the annual output.We stress this because it has an important bearing on our principal conclusions and recommendations, which are as follows:Chapter VIII-The draftsmaris present difficulties*(1) Consideration should be given to the setting up of a training course in legislative drafting (para 8.16).*(2) Advice on draft Bills should be sought from specialists in the relevantbranches of law (para 8.17).(3) There should be no large-scale transfer of drafting work away from theGovernment draftsmen (para 8.18).*(4) The Law Commission^ drafting strength should be restored and indeedfurther increased at the earliest possible moment (para 8.19).*(5) At present, the Government draftsmen should assist with only suchPrivate Members&apos; Bills as are likely to reach the statute book; when there are more draftsmen, support should become more generous(para 8.21).*(6) All available methods should be used to recruit and train more draftsmenas a matter of high priority (para 8.22).Chapter IX British and European approaches to legislation(7) The European legislative tradition has been to express the law in general principles; in this country the tradition has been to specify in detail the application of the law in particular circumstances (para 9.14).Chapter X Conflicts*(8) In principle the interests of the ultimate users should always have priority over those of the legislators: a Bill should be regarded primarilyas a future Act (para 10.3).*(9) More use might be made of examples (in Schedules) showing how aBill is intended to work in particular situations (para 10.7).(10) Demands for immediate certainty of legal effect encourage elaboration(para 10.9).
(11) To enact law in the form of general principles alone may, but does notnecessarily, simplify its application to particular cases (paras 10.10,10.11).(12) Where a Bill has a substantial political or administrative content thedemand for immediate certainty of legal effect must be expected tocontinue: there may however be more scope in private law for legislatingby statement of general principle alone (para 10.12).*(13) The use of statements of principle should be encouraged; wheredetailed guidance is called for in addition, it should be given inSchedules (para 10.13).Chapter XI Drafting techniques(14) The draftsman should not be forced to sacrifice certainty for simplicity(para 11.5).*(15) Statements of purpose:(a) should be used when they are the most convenient method ofclarifying the scope and effect of legislation;(b) when so used, should be contained in clauses and not in preambles(para 11.8).*(16) There should be no general rule about drafting in short sentences, butthere should be as few subordinate phrases as possible before thesubject of a legislative sentence or between the subject and its verb(para 11.10).*(17) There should be no rule or convention precluding the use of a fullstop in the middle of a subsection (or of a section without subsections)(para 11.11).*(18) Long un-&quot;paragraphed&quot; sentences should be avoided (para 11.12).*(19) A statute should be arranged to suit the convenience of its ultimateusers (para 11.13).*(20) The number and kind of definitions included in a statute must ingeneral be left to the draftsman&apos;s judgment, but the definition of an expression by reference to another statute which is obscure or obsolescent-lescent should be avoided (paras 11.15-11.16).*(21) Except in very short Acts, definitions occurring in the body of the Actshould always be indexed (para 11.17).*(22) Ways should be explored of indicating that an expression used in an act is defined in the Act (para 11.18).*(23) Internal cross-references should take the form of precise references tonumbered provisions, and in big Acts may with advantage include aparenthetical description of the subject matter of the provision referredto (para 11.19).(24) The increased use of fractions and other simple mathematical formulaeis welcomed (para 11.20).*(25) Provisions implementing European Community obligations should beso printed as to be easily recognisable (para 11.21).*(26) Other conventions may be preferable for distinguishing passages ofother kinds, and the Statute Law Committee should consider whatvisual aids could be helpful for these purposes (para 11.21).
The type in which Schedules are printed is inconveniently small and alarger one should be used (para 11.22).Schedules of amendments should normally be in tabular form(para 11.23).Queen&apos;s Printers copies and Public General Acts and Measures shouldbe printed with shoulder notes on each page showing section and,where applicable, Part and Chapter numbers (para 11.24).General principles should be set out in the body of a statute, detailed provisions of a permanent kind in Schedules, and details liable tofrequent modification in statutory instruments (para 11.25).Legislation by reference:(a) is unobjectionable when it is used to apply to some matter a codeoriginally passed for the purpose of being applied from time totime to that kind of matter;(b) should not be used where the situation to be dealt with is createdor circumscribed by an earlier enactment the relevant provisionsof which can simply and shortly be incorporated in the newAct;(c) is often objectionable when it is used to apply to a new set of circumstances law originally passed for dealing with another set of circumstances;(d) raises special considerations (discussed in Chapter XIII) when itmodifies an existing enactment(paras 11.28-11.31).Chapter XII Anglo-Scottish legislation*(32) Great Britain departments sponsoring Anglo-Scottish Bills should issue instructions to both English and Scottish draftsmen in time toallow adequate consultation between them; the draftsmen should plan the Bill from the start in consultation with each other (para 12.7).*(33) The draftsmen should be free to produce corresponding but separateprovisions (para 12.7).*(34) Where a minor variant as between England and Scotland occurs withina clause, the technique of using a Scottish substitution or otheradaptation should be avoided and the English and Scottish versionsshould be set out separately (para 12.7).*(35) Wherever a combined Bill cannot be drafted for both countries withoutcomplicated adaptation, legislation enacted in the form of two parallelbut separate Acts should be the standard choice (para 12.8).*(36) Advice should be sought systematically from the English and Scottishdraftsmen before any choice is made in favour of a combined Bill,and proper weight should be given to their advice where it is against that choice (para 12.8).*(37) Consideration should be given to adopting a new procedure (described in para 18.4) for the enactment of separate parallel Acts (para 12.9).*(38) Where urgency and shortage of Parliamentary time have precludedthe introduction of parallel Bills but the combined Act requires an unacceptable degree of alteration to make it suitable for Scotland,*(27)*(28)*(29)*(30)*(31)
a procedure such as is described in paragraph 18.5 should be adopted to permit the speedy re-enactment of a Scottish version (para 12.10).Chapter XIII Amending existing legislation*(39) The needs of the eventual user of the statutes must be given priority over those of the legislator when proposals for amending existing legislation are being framed (para 13.17).(40) Whilst non-textual amendment often adds to the burdens of the user,a Standing Order requiring all amendments to be drafted textuallywould not be in his interests, would not be workable, and is notrecommended (paras 13.17-13.18).*(41) The present practice of amending legislation textually wherever con-venience permits should be applied as generously as possible(paras 13.20, 13.24).*(42) Encouragement should be given to the quick reprinting of loose copiesof Acts as amended (para 13.20).*(43) The Keeling Schedule is not capable of wide application, but whereone is included in a Bill material proposed to be omitted from an existing enactment should be printed in distinguishing type in theSchedule (para 13.22).(44) There is a close link between the pace of consolidation and the rate at which textual amendment can have a beneficial effect on the clarityand simplicity of legislation (para 13.23).*(45) Where a Keeling Schedule or a textual memorandum can assistMembers of Parliament or others in understanding textual amendments,such a Schedule or memorandum should be provided whenever it is reasonably practicable to do so (para 13.24).Chapter XIV Consolidation(46) Consolidation is desirable both for the direct benefits it brings and toprovide a base for the use of the textual method of amendment(para 14.5).(47) It would not be practicable to consolidate the whole statute bookwithin a limited number of years, nor to do so on the principle of&quot;one Act, one subject&quot;, nor to maintain each such &quot;principal&quot; Act in astate of perpetual consolidation by the exclusive use of textual amend-ment; moreover Acts framed in this way would not necessarily beclearer or simpler for the user (paras 14.7-14.10).*(48) The possibility should continue to be explored of recruiting andtraining for consolidation work lawyers with the necessary aptitudeseven though they have not had the full training of Parliamentarydraftsmen (para 14.18).*(49) The Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills should sit in two divisionswhenever the flow of such Bills exceeds the Committee&apos;s capacity fordealing with them in the usual way (para 14.23).*(50) Where powers are conferred to amend Acts by Order in Council inorder to facilitate consolidation, the exercise of the powers should bemade subject to affirmative resolution, and no such resolution should
be taken in the Commons until the relevant order had been reported by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments (para 14.25).*(51) Consolidation can easily be upset by policy decisions involving majoramendments of the existing law, or even by the prospect of such decisions: in order to lessen this risk, it may be prudent in many cases to select a relatively narrow field of legislation for any one consolidatingmeasure (paras 14.28-14.32).(52) Responsibility for consolidation should remain with the Law Corn-missions (para 14.33).*(53) Whilst a pragmatic approach seems inevitable, and the present paceneed not hamper the further introduction of textual amendment,the pace of consolidation should be accelerated (paras 14.34-14.36).Chapter XV-Explanatory material(54) The question whether any, and if so what kind of external explanatorymaterial should be provided is best considered separately for eachstatute, as at present (para 15.2).*(55) The practice of publishing Green or White Papers in advance oflegislation should be extended (para 15.5).*(56) Explanatory memoranda should, as recommended by the SelectCommittee on Procedure, provide more information about the Bill(para 15.7).*(57) The practice should be developed of making available for committee stage debates in both Houses notes on clauses and similar additionali explanatory material (para 15.10).*(58) A trial should be made, initially with uncontroversial Bills, of printingthe explanatory notes opposite the clauses to which they relate (para15.10).*(59) White Papers giving detailed explanations of lengthy and complex bills should be provided more frequently (para 15.11).(60) The practice of Government departments with regard to post-legislativeexplanatory material is well developed and appears to serve its purposeadequately (para 15.17).Chapter XVI How computers would help*(61) Computer assisted typesetting would produce greater speed and accur-acy in the printing of public Bills at all stages; if adopted at the draftingstage, would enable draftsmen to make use of the computer as amechanical aid to drafting; and would facilitate the incorporation of theenacted texts into a comprehensive data base of statute law (para16.26(1) and (2)).*(62) An information retrieval system giving access to such a data basewould be useful to draftsmen and others involved in the preparationof legislation (para 16.26(2) and (3)).*(63) It would also be useful to others whose duties may require them to search the statute book, particularly in connection with the impactupon it of European Community legislation (para 16.26(4)).
*(64) The text initially recorded in the data base should be that of Statutesin Force (para 16.26(5)).*(65) It should be updated immediately upon the enactment of any new legislation; a system of continued computer-assisted editing of Statutesin Force would both facilitate this and make it possible for a newrevised edition of any Act to be produced for Statutes in Force with less expense and effort, particularly if computer typesetting were usedfor Queen&apos;s Printers copies of Acts and if these were produced in thesame format as Statutes in Force (para 16.26(6) and (7)).*(66) The information retrieval system should include a historical file unless this proved to be prohibitively difficult and costly (para 16.26(8)).*(67) The completion of Statutes in Force by 1980 would enable a computer&quot;linked system, of benefit to the draftsmen, to be set up by the same date (para 16.26(9)).*(68) The eventual inclusion of subordinate legislation and case law would increase the value of the system to both Government and other users(para 16.26(10)).*(69) More extensive use of textual amendment should reduce the amount ofeditorial work required in the production of Statutes in Force, and assist in ensuring accuracy, avoiding delay, and reducing costs (para16.26(11)).Chapter XVII-Fiscal legislation(70) The principal reasons for the complexity of fiscal legislation are thetradition of careful differentiation between individual situations andthe enactment of specific anti-avoidance provisions aimed at particularkinds of transactions (paras 17.3-17.6). ,i(71) A change to broader taxing and anti-avoidance rules would involvepolicy decisions which are outside our terms of reference (para 17.7).(72) Given the complexity of the underlying legislative scheme the scope forsimplifying its statutory expression is limited (para 17.10).*(73) The basic provisions affecting the majority of taxpayers should never-theless be framed in relatively simple terms (para 17.10).*(74) Detailed provisions should be made easier to understand by broadstatements of intention (para 17.11).*(75) The scope of a charge or relief should be stated clearly in general termsat the beginning of the section or group of sections dealing with it(para 17.11).(76) Mathematical formulae should continue to be used (but should not become elaborate) (para 17.12).*(77) Definitions should be standardised where no difference in meaning isintended (paras 17.14, 17.16).*(78) Expressions should not be artificially defined to include alien concepts(para 17.15).*(79) Where a difference in meaning is intended, different expressions shouldwhere practicable be used rather than the same expression differentlydefined (para 17.16).
*(80) Subject to the requirements of Budget secrecy and the availability oftime and resources, consideration should be given to some form of pre-legislative outside consultation on fiscal legislation (para 17.19).(81) Finance Bills should not be committed in part to a Select Committee(para 17.20).*(82) Consideration should be given to a procedure enabling correctionsand uncontroversial amendments, certified by the Chairman of ways and Means, to be made to fiscal statutes without debate (para 17.21).(83) As with legislation on other subjects, the relegation of detailed provisionsof a permanent kind to Schedules can help to shorten and simplify the body of an Act (para 17.23).*(84) Changes in fiscal legislation should wherever practicable be made bydirectly altering the text of existing enactments, and a less restrictiveview should be taken of what amendments it is practicable to effecttextually (paras 17.25-17.29).(85) The necessary system of frequent reprints is already available in the taxes Acts (para 17.30).(86) A more liberal use of textual amendment would not necessarily enableconsolidation to take place less frequently than at the ten-year intervalsrecommended by the Royal Commission (para 17.32).Chapter XVIII Parliamentary procedure and scrutiny of drafting(87) No change is called for in the practice relating to the choice of shorttitles for Bills so far as their subject matter is concerned (para 18.2).(88) The time and effort involved in introducing a separate amending Billfor each Act, where several Acts are to be amended at once, wouldnot be justified. Any difficulties caused to practitioners by combiningsuch amendments in a single Bill should disappear with the completionof Statutes in Force (para 18.3).*(89) There should be a separate, parallel Bill for Scotland wherever a com-bined Bill cannot be drafted in straightforward terms for both countries.Consideration should be given to adopting a new procedure (whichwe describe) for the passage of such parallel Bills through both Houses(para 18.4).*(90) Where urgency and shortage of Parliamentary time have precludedthe introduction of parallel Bills but the United Kingdom Act resultingfrom a combined Bill requires substantial adaptation to make itworkable in Scotland, the provisions which apply to Scotland shouldbe re-enacted, in Scotland-only form, by the shortened procedureapplicable to consolidation or preferably by a new procedure enabling the re-enactment to be presented for Royal Assent, as if passed by bothHouses, after being reported by a special Joint Committee and notresolved against by either House (paras 18.5-18.6).*(91) The House of Lords should appoint a committee to which Scotland-onlyBills could be committed at the Committee stage (para 18.7).*(92) As a standard constitutional practice there should be a Scottish lawyer,whether or not a Law Officer, in the ministerial team in the Houseof Lords (para 18.7).
*(93) The rule of the House of Commons that the scope of a Bill is limitedto a particular part of the United Kingdom if, but only if, such a limitation is written into the long title should be abolished (para 18.10).*(94) Where an Act affects only the law of England and Wales this shouldbe indicated in the short title (para 18.11).*(95) As an experiment, the practice adopted by the editors of Statutes inForce of printing on the title page of each Act the initial letters of the parts of the United Kingdom to which it applies should be extendedto Bills and to Queen&apos;s Printers copies of Acts (para 18.13).*(96) A clearly stated extent clause should ordinarily be included in Bills,and where the extent of a particular clause is different from that of theBill as a whole this should be indicated in a side note to that clause(para 18.14).(97) Common form provisions should continue to be grouped togetherat the end of the statute (para 18.17).(98) No change is required in the present rules and practice relating todebates on &quot;clause stand part&quot; (para 18.20).*(99) Provisions relating to financial expenditure should not be printed initalics in Government Bills as introduced in the Commons (para 18.22).*(100) There should be consultation between the two Houses with a viewto submitting agreed proposals for harmonising the form of amendments to Bills (para 18.23).*(101) The possibility of deferring the re-numbering of clauses until theRoyal Assent proof stage should be looked at again when the applica-tion of computer techniques to the preparation of legislation has been developed to a greater extent (para 18.24).*(102) Appropriation and Consolidated Fund Acts which give effect to SupplyResolutions should be abolished, and the Resolutions themselvesshould be regarded as sufficient authority for the appropriation andspending of grants; but some other means must be found to allow the commons to pursue the redress of grievances before the granting ofthe supply (para 18.25).(103) It should be left to Government departments to decide what advice on the drafting of their Bills they should seek from advisory bodiesbefore presentation (para 18.29).(104) There is no practical scope for a new stage of scrutiny of draftingduring the Parliamentary process (para 18.33).*(105) Unless there is special urgency there should always be at least:(a) two week-ends between the first publication of a Bill and the debate on second reading in the first House;(b) fourteen days between second reading and the start of thecommittee stage;(c) on all Bills of considerable length or complexity, 14 days betweenpublication of the Bill as amended in committee and the start ofthe report stage(para&apos;18.34).
*(106) There should be a procedure for incorporating improvements (includingthe correction of obvious inaccuracies), certified by the Speaker andthe Lord Chancellor to be of a drafting nature, after the passing of aBill by both Houses and before Royal Assent (para 18.36).*(107) There should be a procedure, similar to that for consolidation Bills,for the re-enactment of statutes, in whole or in part, with draftingimprovements (para 18.38).*(108) The Lord Chancellor should arrange for the Statute Law Committeeto keep the structure and language of the statutes under continuous review (para 18.40).*(109) The Statute Law Committee should also:(a) review the carrying into effect of those of our recommendations that are accepted, in particular our recommendation with respectto textual amendment ;(b) publish reports (to be laid before Parliament) from time to time,but not less often than every three years(paras 18.40, 18.41).*(110) In the main the procedures of Parliament do not in themselves have adetrimental effect on the clarity and simplicity of legislation, but wherethe drafting of Bills becomes defective because of the application of aprocedural rule the Government (and Parliament) have a clearresponsibility to set matters right (para 18.42).Chapter XIX Interpretation of Statutes(111) Interpretation influences drafting (paras 19.1-19.2).*(112) The preparation of a comprehensive new Interpretation Act should beput in hand (para 19.11).*(H3) The following matters should be made generally admissible by statute for the interpretation of Acts of Parliament, as recommended by theLaw Commissions:(a) all indications provided by the Act as printed by authority(para 19.21); and(b) relevant international agreements and European Communityinstruments (paras 19.22, 19.39).They should be given no more weight than is appropriate in thecircumstances (para 19.25).(114) The following should not be made so admissible:(a) reports of Royal Commissions and similar bodies; and(b) White Papers and similar documents(para 19.23).(115) Although Parliament may in any Act declare specified material outsidethe Act to be admissible for interpreting it, specially prepared explana-tory materials should not in general be so declared (para 19.24).* (116) It should be enacted that those constructions are to be preferredwhich:(a) would promote the general legislative purpose (para 19.28);(b) are consistent with international obligations (para 19.28);(c) exclude retrospective effect (para 19.32).
*(117) The provisions recommended in sub-paragraphs (113) and (116) abovemight usefully form part of the comprehensive new Interpretation Actrecommended in sub-paragraph (112) (paras 19.31, 19.32).(118) The rules as to the use of preambles in the interpretation of statutesshould not be altered (so as to enable a preamble to control anenactment which is in itself clear and precise) (para 19.33).(119) The European Communities Act 1972 secures the interpretation inaccordance with European Court principles of European CommunityTreaty provisions and Community instruments that have legal effect inthe United Kingdom without further enactment (para 19.38).*(120) To assist our courts in interpreting United Kingdom legislationintended to implement other European Community Treaty provisions and Community instruments:(a) such legislation should contain a clear statement that it is sointended; and(b) relevant Community instruments should be made generallyadmissible by statute for the interpretation of such legislation;(para 19.39; see also sub-paragraph (113) above).(121) Interpretation of Acts drafted in a less elaborate style need present no great problems: the real problem is whether Parliament would have sufficient confidence in the courts (para 19.41).David Renton (Chairman)Atholl1BaconSamuel Cooke3Basil Engholm2JAR FinlayJohn Gibson1Peter Henderson2Noel Hutton3Kenneth Mackenzie2Patrick Macrory2S J MosleyIvor RichardEwan Stewart1A M Macpherson (Secretary)Robert Cumming (Assistant Secretary)19 March 1975&quot;Subject to Note 1 below.Subject to Note 2 below.3Subject to Note 3 below.
1.  Note by the Duke of Atholl, Sir John Gibson and Lord Stewart1. We are in complete agreement with what has been said in Chapter XIIof the Report about legislating for two different legal systems in one Act.We think it necessary, however, that we should make an additional point which is highly relevant to ensuring that Scottish statute law is kept free ofthe strains and distortions referred to by the late Lord Cooper, and recentlyby Lord Hunter, and generally to maintaining the objectives of clarity andsimplicity in that law.2. It seems likely that some part of the Westminster Parliament^ legislativefunction may eventually be devolved to a Scottish legislature, and we are con-cerned lest it be thought, if this happens, that the points made by the Committeein Chapter XII will then be less relevant to Westminster law-making thanthey are at present. This, however, would not be the right view. In the fields of the &quot;retained&quot; subjects departments in Whitehall will continue to promotelegislation applying to Scotland as well as to England; and the Scottish element of such legislation, whether it be in a separate Scottish Act or combined withthe English element in a single Act, will, as now be part of the law of Scotland.The need in the Westminster machine to have adequate Scottish legal adviceat all levels and the participation of Scottish Parliamentary draftsmen (in both cases with the improvements suggested in Chapter XII) will therefore remain. If there is a failure in any new organisation to meet that need and take full account of the Scottish dimension, Westminster additions to the Scottishstatute book will continue to give dissatisfaction to judges and practitionersfrom time to time; and if less than the present standard of legal service isprovided, it is all too likely that the quality of such additions will revert to thelow level exhibited in the period prior to 1871.Atholl,John Gibson,Ewan Stewart.2. Note by Sir Basil Engholm, Mr Peter Henderson, Mr Kenneth Mackenzieand Sir Patrick Macrory1. There is one matter on which some of us wish to make a recommendationadditional to those embodied in the Report which we have signed with our colleagues.2. In paragraph 15.10 of Chapter XV the Committee have recommendedthat, as an experiment, explanatory notes should be printed on the pages of aBill opposite the clauses to which they refer, and have suggested that thisexperiment should be tried with a number of non-controversial Bills, withthe purpose of helping users of the Bill to a better understanding of it. Theseexplanatory notes, like explanatory memoranda, would disappear when theBill became law. In the opinion of those who have signed this AdditionalNote, users of the Act should also have the opportunity of seeing whether such explanatory notes would be of assistance to them.
3. The main argument against such a step is that this would create, in ProfessorReed Dickerson&apos;s words, &quot;a split-level statute&quot; and that the lay explanation of the legal language would be less reliable, and could be argumentative. notes on the clauses of a Bill are always prepared for the assistance of Ministers, and,as the Report points out, these have, on occasion, been made available toParliament. Such notes need to be, and are, accurate. Moreover, such explanatorynotes could, if it were thought desirable, be certified by the Lord Chancelloras being non-argumentative explanations of the sections to which they refer.For these reasons the undersigned do not consider this argument to be conclusiveagainst trying such an experiment.4. We therefore recommend that the experiment with the Bills should beextended to the Acts which they become. This would mean that where, duringthe trial period, Bills include explanatory notes, these should, suitably amended to reflect any changes as a result of the Bill becoming an Act, be printed on thepages of the Act opposite the sections to which they refer. We emphasise thatwe have in mind an experiment only; that we suggest that the notes should beincluded only in the Queen&apos;s Printer&apos;s copy of the Act, not in the bound volumesof the statutes (which are already big enough); and that they should be intro-duced by a statement, similar to the statement printed at the beginning ofexplanatory notes to statutory instruments, to the effect that the notes do notform part of the Act.Basil Engholm,Peter Henderson,Kenneth Mackenzie,Patrick Macrory.3.  Note by Sir Samuel Cooke and Sir Noel HuttonIn paragraph 15.10 the Committee recommend that a trial should be made,initially with uncontroversial Bills, of printing explanatory notes opposite tothe clauses to which they refer. A similar suggestion was considered but notcommended by the Select Committee on Procedure in paragraph 63 of their second Report for 1970-71. The Select Committee&apos;s reason for advisingagainst the suggestion was that it would be difficult to exclude argumentativematter from the explanatory notes. We, the undersigned, are in agreement withthe Select Committee&apos;s conclusion for the reason which they gave. We aretherefore not in agreement with the final recommendation in paragraph 15.10of the Report of our own Committee. As for the further suggestion, favoured by some of our number, that explanatory notes be printed with an Act oppositethe sections to which they refer, we think it would open the way to muchuncertainty in the construction of Acts of Parliament. It could also give rise to serious editing and publishing problems.Samuel Cooke,Noel Hutton.

APPENDIX BSOME JUDICIAL CRITICISMS OF DRAFTING(Chapter VI, paragraph 6.4)Statute	Text	Cases	Nature of criticism1. Finance Act 1960, section 28(1) (now Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970, section 460(1))	&quot;28.-(1) Where-(a) in any such circumstances as are men-tioned in the next following subsection, and (b) in consequence of a transaction in securities or of the combined effect of two or more such transactions, a person is in a position to obtain, or has obtained, a tax advantage, then unless he shows that the transaction or transactions were carried out either for bona fide commercial reasons or in the ordinary course of making or managing investments, and that none of them had as their main object, or one of their main objects, to enable tax advantages to be obtained, this section shall apply to him in respect of that transaction or those transactions: Provided that this section shall not apply to him if  (i) the  transaction  or  transactions  in securities were carried out, and (ii) any change in the nature of any activities carried on by a person, being a change necessary in order that the tax advantage should be obtainable, was effected, before the fifth day of April, nineteen hundred and sixty.&quot;	Greenberg v 1958-59 [1972] AC 109, 145	&quot;The meaning of &apos;carried out&apos; in the body of this subsection must be &apos;effected&apos; because the purpose of a transaction, bona fide or otherwise, could only be ascertained at its inception and could not await the conclusion of the transaction. But . . . the ordinary and natural meaning of ^carried out&apos; is implemented&apos;. Moreover, the interpretation of &quot;carried out&apos; must be considered in the context of the whole of section 28. The operation of &quot;dividend stripping&apos; necessarily consists of a number of transactions, all leading to achieve the result of tax avoidance. This is shown by the reference to &quot;combined effect of two or more&apos; transactions in the body of section 28(1). In these circumstances I am driven to the con-clusion that the words &quot;carried out&apos; have a different meaning in the body of section 28(1) from that which they have in the proviso. This, of course, is an unhappy conclusion to reach but draftsmen, like Homer, sometimes &quot;nod&apos; and perhaps in the unnecessary complexity of section 28 this is not surprising. It appears to me that &quot;carried out&apos; in the proviso must have the wider meaning of &quot;implemented&apos; . . . If it did not have this wider meaning the purpose of the section would be very largely defeated. A trans-action which had only entered its initial stage of an agreement prior to April 5, 1960, would be protected by the proviso although the tax advantage might not be obtained until some time			after April 5, 1960.&quot; (per Lord Guest).
2. Limitation Act 1963,      &quot;(3) In this Part of this Act any reference to section 7(3) the material facts relating to a cause of action isa reference to any one or more of the following,that is to say (a) the fact that personal injuries resulted from the negligence, nuisance or breach of duty constituting that cause ofaction;(b) the nature or extent of the personalinjuries resulting from that negligence,nuisance or breach of duty;(c) the fact that the personal injuries soresulting were attributable to thatnegligence, nuisance or breach of duty,or the extent to which any of thosepersonal injuries were so attributable.&quot;*.Central Asbestos CoLtdv Dodd [1973]AC518, 529, 531-534, 553&quot;Normally one expects to be able to find atleast some clue to the general purpose and policyof an Act by reading it as a whole in light of thecircumstances which existed when it was passedor of the mischief which it must have been intended to remedy. But here I can find none.The obscurity of the Act has been frequently and severely criticised . . .[As to section 7(3)] I find it impossible, even after the able arguments which were submittedto us, to discover or even surmise what the draftsman can have had in mind when he draftedthis subsection in this way. I have already pointedout that before a plaintiff can reasonably bringhis action he must know four things: (1) thenature and extent of his injuries; (2) what the defendant did; (3) causation of the former bythe latter; and (4) that what the defendant didwas wrongful. These four elements are inextric-ably confused in (a), (b) and (c) in this subsection. . . Normally one assumes that when the sameword [&apos;negligence&apos;] is used twice or more in thesame section it has the same meaning. But insuch a welter of bad drafting as one finds here that would be a very unsafe assumption.On the whole matter the Act is so obscure thatI do not think it possible to form a confidentopinion.&quot; (per Lord Reid).&quot;This Act has been before the courts on many occasions during its comparatively short life.I do not think there are many judges who havehadjto consider it who have not criticised the-vhofly unnecessary complexity and deplorableoysurity of its language. It seems as if it wasforrciiiated to disguise rather than reveal theWeaning which it was intended to bear.&quot; (perLord Salmon).

Onreading L ray first impression was that it isobscure to the point of unintelligibility and thatimpression has been confirmed by the able and prolonged arguments which were submitted tous ... I have suggested what may be a possiblemeaning, but if I am wrong about that I wouldnot shrink from holding that the subsection is so obscure that no meaning can be given to it.&quot;(per Lord Reid).&quot;. . . justly described by Lord Denning MR asbeing &apos;very obscure&apos; . . .&quot; (per Lord Morris ofBorth-y-Gest).&quot;The machinery which has been used in orderto effect the detention of the appellants is setout in a complicated series of provisions in theAct of 1971. I regret that in a matter whichaffects directly so many individuals so labyrin-thine a path requires to be followed. I shall not attempt to trace its windings, for to do so wouldobscure the relatively compact points on whichthe appeals depend.&quot; (per Lord Wilberforce).&quot;Whether or not an Act should be retrospectivein its effect is a matter for the decision ofParliament alone ... I feel bound, however, toexpress concern that the draftsmen of this Actshould have chosen to achieve its retrospectiveeffect through a labyrinth of verbiage which maywell have been as perplexing to many of thosewho had to consider it in Parliament as itundoubtedly was to those whom it may havedeprived of their constitutional rights ... Itwould surely have been easier, far more satis-factory and fairer to have made this plain byexpress language in one of the main sections ofthe Act. It is impossible to ignore the danger thatthe unnecessarily circuitous and complicatedfashion in which the power to act retrospectivelywas conferred (if it was conferred by the Act)may have concealed the very existence of that power.&quot; (per Lord Salmon).

Statute	Text	Cases	Nature of criticism8. Theft Act 1968, section 16	&quot;16. (1) A person who by any deception dishonestly obtains for himself or another any pecuniary advantage shall on conviction on indictment be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding rive years. (2) The cases in which a pecuniary advantage within the meaning of this section is to be regarded as obtained for a person are cases where  (a) any debt or charge for which he makes himself liable or is or may become liable (including one not legally enforce-able) is reduced or in whole or in part evaded or deferred; or (b) he is allowed to borrow by way of over-draft, or to take out any policy of insurance or annuity contract,  or obtains an improvement in the terms on which he is allowed to do so; or (c) he is given the opportunity to earn remuneration or greater remuneration in an office or employment, or to win money by betting.               ^ (3) For the purposes of this section &apos;decep-tion&apos; has the same meaning as in section 15 of this Act.&quot;	R v Turner [1973] 3 WLR 352, 354, 357 (HL)	&quot;This section was new and throughout the years that have passed since its enactment there has been acute controversy as to its meaning and effect. I am not surprised at that. At first sight it may look simple, but the more it is examined the greater are the difficulties in finding its proper construction. It is clear that it was intended to widen the scope of the existing law, but I cannot deduce from its terms or from anything else in the Act any clear indication of the extent of the change which was intended . . . The first part [of subsection (2)] is drafted in an unusual way. Does it mean that in the cases set out in heads (a), (b) and (c) a pecuniary advantage is to be deemed to have been obtained, so that it is irrelevant to consider whether in fact any such advantage was obtained, and equally irrelevant to prove that nothing in the nature of pecuniary advantage was in fact obtained by the accused? I think that must be its meaning though I am at a loss to understand why that was not clearly stated ... I would allow this appeal and restore the conviction of the respondent. I would add that it is extremely unfortunate that an important new criminal provision should be drafted in the form of section 16. It is possible that the section was amended at some stage during the passage of the Bill. But even so, I would hope that ways can be found of drafting such provisions in a form which does not require elaborate and rarified analysis to discover their meaning. Not every lawyer has the aptitude or the leisure for that task and few laymen could attempt it. No doubt any attempt to make such provisions readily intelligible would require them to be greatly expanded, but surely any disadvantage arising from that would be trifling in comparison with the advantage of making them intelligible to more than a minute proportion of Her Majesty&apos;s subjects to whom they are addressed.&quot; (per Lord Reid).

Alas, they underestimated theingenuity of lawyers and surveyors . . . Wecannot escape from the conclusion that if parliament meant to exclude the sitting tenantit could and would have said so in clear terms.&quot;[These comments were on the section as originally enacted.

How much regard is to be had, and what weight is to be attached to the regard when it has been had? . . . The section is indeed puzzling . . .
