DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 63 COPY NO       8219 May 1975CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY 1975Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. We need to settle the basis for the 1975 Public Expenditure Survey,which unfortunately has been delayed by the Budget and the associateddiscussions on the 1976-77 programmes.EXPENDITURE PLANNING AND CONTROL2.        I have explained separately in C(75) 62 the main reasons why theexpenditure plans in the January White Paper (Cmnd 5879) now look greaterthan the economy is likely to be able to afford.    This paper concentrates onthe implications of this for public expenditure planning.3. We already face a number of serious difficulties in the public expenditure field.    The first of these is the relationship between the actualgrowth of expenditure and the target which we set last year.    Expenditurerose very rapidly in 1974-75 - overall by around 10 per cent in cost terms -even though we generally did not reinstate the specific cuts which our predecessors had imposed in December 1973.    In honouring our Electioncommitments, we greatly increased spending on pensions and other social security benefits, subsidies and housing.    These items together account for a large proportion of the increases in 1974-75 over the previousGovernmenfs provision.    Expenditure is expected to continue to grow in1975-76, even if not as fast as in the previous year.4,        The general picture can therefore be set out like this.    The white paper, based on the target of 2f per cent average annual increase for public expenditure in demand terms, provided for the total of public expenditure in1978-79 to be nearly  5 billion in volume above the level attained in 1973-74.About two-thirds of this rise, however, has been taken up by the big increases which have already taken place, leaving only one-third, or about 1.6 billion, for the growth in the remaining three years from 1975-76 to1978-79.    This profile restricts our room for manoeuvre in adjustingexpenditure plans for later years.1
5.        The second problem arises from the difficulty we are experiencingin keeping even within the White Paper levels.    Some expenditures have for some time been allowed to increase without restraint.    We can nolonger afford this.    The hard fact is that, however high the priority whichwe give to, say, housing, every increase, whether for policy or estimatingreasons, pre-empts resources that could otherwise be devoted to somethingelse.    We must settle the amount we want to devote to these programmes in the light of the priority we attach to them, and then ensure that theyconform with those plans.6.        On top of this, there are the large sums needed for the programmes which were not costed and included m Cmnd 5879, especially for theextension of public ownership in various fields,,    While some elements inour expenditure on industry, such as compensation paid to existing owners,may not have a big demand content, they still exacerbate the problems of monetary management;  and the provision for investment in an expandedpublic sector, including the commitments we have just announced forBritish Leyland, represent a real addition to the public sector&apos;s demand on resources and cash.    Any large commitments of this kind which weenter into inevitably pre-empt the subsequent room for manoeuvre in our discussion of expenditure priorities.    We must therefore in future bothlimit and phase our expenditure in this field, and impose effective criteriaon assistance to industry.7.        There are too the usual stream of smaller, and not so small, items which come up every week as claims in the contingency reserve.    Thereserve for 1975-76, which was put in the White Paper at  300 million in demand terms at 1974 Survey prices, is now already exhausted.    Thereserve for the later years would quickly go the same way if all the claims which the Treasury knows about were to be met.    I have already instructed the Treasury to adopt a most stringent attitude to all such further claims.One of the things we shall need to do in the present Survey is to reconstitutean adequate contingency reserve.8.        It would thus anyway be difficult enough, particularly in the face ofthe large and uncertain expenditure commitments in the field of industrialsupport and extension of public ownership, and the problem of controllinglocal authority current expenditure, even to keep to the planned levels in cmnd 5879, as altered by the 1976-77 reductions.    Sectoral objectivesinvolving public expenditure, however desirable in themselves, must now be firmly subordinated to the overriding need to keep the total within what wecan afford.    This will require close attention to priorities, as well as astringent attitude to public expenditure decisions as they are taken.    Localauthority expenditure will require particularly careful attention;  and weshall need to take full advantage of discussions in the new consultative council on local government finance.2
PRIORITIES9. I am aware of my colleagues concern that we should in thesecircumstances pay particular attention to our priorities.    I agree withthis.    We took a view last year about priorities (see my Cabinet paper c(74) 120), and the allocations to the programmes were built on this.    Wehave since modified them in some respects, notably in the recognition thatsubsidies on nationalised industry products and on food must be scaled downand for the most part eliminated as rapidly as possible.    On the other hand,we have so far tried to maintain high priority for certain improvements in social security benefits and housing and for measures of industrial support and training, and expansion on an economic basis of our agriculture;whereas in defence, following a full scale review, our commitments and capabilities have already been reduced, and the expenditure cut accordingly.The other large programmes are health and personal social services;education; law and order;  roads and transport; and other environmental services.    We must recognise that any significant re-ordering of priorities must involve quite big reductions in some of the programmesI have mentioned to offset improvements elsewhere.    These programmesdo of course include all the main local authority services, and the questionof priorities will need to be covered in the Consultative Council discussions.There will be severe pressures all round, and we need to ensure that theresources which can be made available are put to the best possible usewithin, as well as between, programmes.THE NEXT STEPS10.       We do not have at this stage to reach final decisions on all thesematters.    What we do have to do now is to settle what information we shall require in order to take decisions on them.    A simple re-costing of existing policies will not provide a useful basis since this would not take account ofthe resource and tax constraints described in C(75) 62.    Given that: the assumptions underlying Cmnd 5879 now appear more favourable than wecan realistically expect, further substantial increases in the tax burden willbe required if we adhere to the expenditure plans of that White Paper.   Andwe have seen the strong reaction to the tax increases which I have had toimpose this year, although few responsible people have doubted theirnecessity.11.        We have already reduced the programmes for 1976-77, and this isa useful start.    What we now need to put in hand is an assessment of the implications of a reduction from previously planned levels in each of the later years.    The prospects discussed in the note attached to C(75) 62suggest that the overall volume reduction in 1978-79 would need to be atleast  2 billion at 1974 Survey prices and might very well have to be more.This would imply significant net reductions in 1977-78 and 1978-79 comparedwith the White Paper level for 1975-76.    A decision on the actual reductionsneeded must await the full information provided by the Survey and this year&apos;smedium-term economic assessment.    We clearly need in the Survey an indication of what might be involved in reducing programmes by biggeramounts say  3 billion in all, in order to give ourselves room for manoeuvreon priorities.3
12.       To do this we shall need to give appropriate guidance to officials,having regard to the priorities so far established and to the nature of thecontrol exercised over different categories of expenditure.    In the case ofexpenditure on goods and services the most convenient method is to askofficials to illustrate the implications of percentage reductions.   For some services, however, the expenditure is determined by previous policy decisions and the level of demand placed on the service: for these, andmore generally for transfer payments, this percentage technique is lessappropriate, and we should instead ask officials to give a general indication of the savings that might flow from changes in the underlying policy.13.       The Appendix to this paper indicates the kind of guidance I proposewe should give.    The percentage reductions applied to expenditure on goods and services would continue, and intensify, the action already taken for1976-77.    If implemented, they would produce a total reduction on goods and services of about  1 billion in 1977-78 and about  l  billion in 1978-79.This implies that total expenditure on goods and services in 1978-79 wouldbe about  j billion below the White Paper level for the present financialyear.    Reductions of this order would contribute about one-half of thefigure of  3 billion mentioned in paragraph 11 above, leaving the other halfto be provided by the illustration of possible policy options in other categories.    If however a sufficient amount cannot be found from these other categories, further savings might eventually have to be found fromgoods and services,    The fact that most transfer payments and some other services have not been covered by the percentage formula does not mean that they should be exempt from scrutiny.    In their case the Survey reportmust display the widest possible range of policy options, again notexcluding substantial reductions in real terms compared with 1975-76,    Iam sure that we shall need to seek substantial savings in this field, although in deciding the pattern of such savings we shall have to take into accounttheir full implications.    When the results of the Survey are available, weshall be able to consider the implications for all the various programmes,and decide what changes need to be made in our policies or priorities,taking into account the latest view of the economic prospects,TIMING14,       I realise that the preparation of a report on these lines will be asubstantial task for Departments.   A start on this work has inevitablyhad to wait while we settled the changes in 1976-77.    It is important thatit should now be begun without further delay, so that the results of the work by officials on the Survey, and the medium-term economic assessmentwhich is very closely linked with it, can be available for us to discuss assoon as possible.4
CONCLUSION15.       I recommend that for the 1975 public expenditure Survey officials should be asked to proceed on the lines indicated in the Appendix to this paper.    If my colleagues agree1, I will put this in hand through the interdepartmental Public Expenditure Survey Committee.D W treasury Chambers19 May 19755
PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY 1975THE GROUND RULESIntroductionThe purpose of the Survey is to illustrate for Ministers the implications for expenditure programmes of reducing the levelof public expenditure below that shown in the January 1975White Paper (Cmnd 5379)-     The aim is to provide Ministers witha basis for their  discussions&apos; on the total level, of public expenditure and on the priorities to be observed within the total.2.     The reductions in expenditure in 1976-77 announced in theBudget statement will need to be reflected in the Survey.     Theproposed ground rules for the subsequent years are designed to illustrate the effect of a progressive reduction from the Crand5879 levels in those years.     So far as possible, these groundrules treat expenditure by reference to its general economiccategory, although some adaptation has been necessary in particular cases,The basic starting point for the Survey is the expenditure programme figures incorporated in the White Paper, revalued to1975 Survey prices, and adjusted to reflect changes, both policyand estimating changes, recorded up to the starting date for the survey, which, it is suggested, should be     2 3    May. These&apos;basic figures would then be further modified as indicated inparagraphs 5-11 below, supplemented where necessary by Annexes1 and 2.4.     Officials in Departments and the Treasury (and the CivilService Department, as appropriate) would then assess the extentto which existing policies could still be carried out at or within these modified programme totals.     If the existing policiescould not be carried out without exceeding these totals, thereport should show what could be accomplished within the totals,and the policy changes which this might involve.    In the case of services to which percentage reductions do not apply, officials shouldexplore and illustrate the implications of policy changes which departments or the Treasury consider could he made to reduce expenditure.
Galcj^last^cn^jof^the modified totals5.     Subject to the special cases mentioned in Annex 2, thegeneral principles to be applied are as follows.1975-766.     The figures to be entered in the Survey are the latestcostings as at    2 3  May   19 75, and will include any modifications flowing from the changes to 1976-77 announced inthe Chancellor&apos;s Budget Statement.1976-777.     The figures to be entered are the basic figures as inparagraph 3 above, modified to take account of changes announced   -in the Budget Statement.1977-78 and 1978-798.     The total figures to be entered for these years would generally be derived by a broad percentage adjustment of the basicfigures in paragraph 3 above.9.     The percentage reductions to be applied to the basic figures are explained in Annex 1,     These reductions apply to current expenditure on goods and services, current grants to private bodies,gross domestic fixed capital formation and capital grants to persons and private non-profit making bodies.     Other economiccategories, and the services listed as exceptions in Annex 1, wouldnot be subject to these percentage reductions, but would betreated in accordance with Annex 2.     It should however be stressed that the application of percentage reductions is designed toproduce certain totals for each of the main programmes (and departmental shares in those programmes, including any expenditure incurred on their behalf by the Property Services Agency).Departments would generally then be free to reallocate the totalswithin their share of each programme, provided that the overalldemand content is not thereby increased.
.1.979-8010.     For this year no figures are available from Cmnd 5879-     the survey totals for this year should therefore be calculated byestimating the expenditure in 1979-80 which would flow from a continuation of the modified policies which could be affordedwithin the totals derived as explained above for the earlier years.Except where justified by demographic factors, the growth of each,main programme from 1978-79 to 1979-80 should not be allowed to exceed the average annual growth rate during the period 1975-76to 1978-79 implied by the figures to be entered in the Survey forthat period.Programmes not costed in the White Paper11.     The programmes in the White Paper do not include the cost ofcertain policies which Ministers had decided to adopt before theWhite Paper was published, but which had not at that stage reachedthe point at which they could be costed on a year-by-year basic,These were left as a potential charge on the contingency reserve..Wherever possible, these programmes should now be costed with a comparable degree of stringency to that implied above for other programmes, for consideration by Ministers in the light of the survey.Charges12c     In certain cases (eg school meals) a charge is levied as anoffset to the cost,.     For the purpose of the Survey, the calculation of these chages should be based on the assimptions underlying theWhite Paper figures.     The expenditure totals should be derived fromthe White Paper figures for the cost of the service net of charges.The report should thus display the consequences (whether in. termsof charging policy or some other policy modifications) of keeping the cost of the service, net of charges, within the totals modified in accordance with the procedure set out above.     The possibilityof increasing charges should also be separately examined in allcases.
Sjyvinrs through lev.or standardsI7;.     The Prime Minister has asked the Treasury and the CPRSto follow up the replies sent by&quot;Departments to the Prime Minister&apos;sminute of 24 December about the prospects for expenditure savingsthrough lov^er standards.     Treasury expenditure divisions (inconsultation with CPRS) will discuss with departments, in the context of the 1975 Survey, the extent to which lower standardscould contribute to expenditure reductions in the programmesconcerned .     A report on the outcome will be incorporated in the survey report.
Capital grants to private sector persons and )private non-profit- )making bodies ))The following services are not subject to these general percentagereductions, but should instead be treated in accordance with the relevant paragraphs of Annex 2: investment by nationalised industries,Regional Water Authorities and the Civil Aviation Authority; certainexpenditures in support of productive industry (see paragrpah 3 of annex 2); housing (including new dwellings in other programmes);basic needs&quot; school building; defence; superannuation payments;achinistrative costs of social security benefits and revenue collection and current expenditure on certain &quot;demand-determined&quot; services (seeParagraph 9 of Annex 2),-   PERCENTAGE REDUCTIONSShe percentage reductions referred to in paragraph 9 of the mainpaper are as follows:-&quot;&quot;    4277-78 1978-79CurrentCurrent expenditure on goods and services- wages and salaries- other cegs )        5% 10%Current grants to privatebodiesB,    CapitalGross domestic fixed capital formation
RULES FOR PARTICULAR CATEGORIESThe general principles in the main ground rules may require modification in the following cases.Expenditure in support of productive industry.     The productive investment of the nationalised industries, the   i -Civil Aviation Authority and Regional Water Authorities, needs to beconsidered in the light of the demand for their products and their commercial prospects, and their contribution to the growth of thecountryfs productive capacity and exports.    The investment programmes should be discussed individually between the Treasury and departments in the light of these criteria.3.     Expenditure on regional support and regeneration; industrialinnovation; general support for industry; functioning of the labour market; agricultural support; support for fishing industry; andexpenditure on infrastructure which is a direct- consequence of thedevelopment of offshore oil; will not be subject to the percentagereductions in Annex 1, but otherwise the general procedure inparagraphs 3 and h of the main ground rules would apply..Hpja s ijog .k*     Expenditure on housing (and new dwellings in other programmes)is not subject to the percentage reductions in Annex 1, but the1976-77) should be reduced by a sum equal to the reduction announcedfor 1976-77 in the Budget Statement.   Otherwise the general proceduredescribed In paragraphs 3 and 1+ of the main ground rules would apply.Dcfence5.     Defence has already been subjected to a full review, and substantial reductions by comparison with the cost of previous .plans were announced by the Secretary of State on 3 December.   Thefigures to be used for the 1975 Survey should therefore be as follows:a.     For 197^-77* the revalued White Paper figure modified inaccordance with the Chancellor*s Budget Statement;
CONFIDENTIALb.     For the years from 1977-78 onwards, the revalued white paper figures modified in accordance with the Cabinet/decision that detailed studies should be initiated to attemptto accelerate the savings resulting from the recent defence review.In addition, an indication should be given of the effect of applyingreductions comparable to those in Annex 1 to the years from 1977-78onwards, should such reductions be greater than those achieved by b9above. &apos; .Overseas aid.    The overseas aid programme would be subject to the same levelof percentage reductions as that shown for current expenditure on goods and services in part A of the table in Annex 1.    Superannuationpayments vrould not be covered by these reductions, nor wouldexpenditure by the Commonwealth Development Corporation whieluis notcounted within the aid programme.Current grants to persons1.     Expenditure classified under this heading (and the relatedadministrative costs) should be forecast on the basis of numbers-eligible and the economic assumptions adopted for the Survey.    Itwill be necessary to explore or illustrate policy changes v/hichDepartments or the Treasury consider could be made to reduce expenditure on those programmes and the savings which these would imply,    It will he particularly important to identify new services or benefits on which expenditure is due to start during the survey period but where the expenditure is not irrevocably committed   (a)in operational terms or (b)  in terms of public announcements. Midies8,     The figures for subsidies in each of the years after 1976-77should be reduced by at least as much as the reductions announced forthat year.    The possibility of further reductions should be fullyexplored in all cases.
^Dproand-determincd1&apos; services9,    The level of expenditure on some services is &quot;demand-determined&quot;in the sense that once the basic framework has been laid down allproper demands on it have to be met and arbitrary financial limitscannot readily be imposed.    Current expenditure on the following-services is not therefore subject to the percentage reductions inparagraph 1, viz: family practitioner services, drugs, food and medical stores in hospitals and social service homes, grants forresidential homes, welfare milk, school meals and milk and schooltransport, concessionary fares paid under existing schemes, legal aid, crown and police prosecutions, food in prisons, rates on government property, and other rent and rates.    Instead, the best available estimate should be given of the likely cost of uptake of theservices concerned.    If there is an estimating reduction comparedwith Cmnd 5879? it should not be used to finance increases in otherparts of the main programme concerned.    If there is an. estimatingincrease, officials should,wherever possible,  identify savings whichwould enable the increase to be absorbed.    The Departments concerned would need to reach agreement with the Treasury at the outset on theextent to which their expenditure may fall to be dealt with underthis heading.    It will be necessary to explore or illustrate policy changes which Departments or the Treasury consider could be made toreduce expenditure on these programmes, and the savings which these would imply.    It will be particularly important to identify earlyin the Survey new services or benefits on which expenditure is dueto start during the Survey period but where the expenditure is notirrevocably committed . (a) in operational terms or (b) in terms ofpublic announcements.Othgr- categories10.   For debt interest, sxiperannuation payments, the administrative[ costs of revenue collection, and unattributed e.c. contributions, thelatest available forecasts should be provided.11.   For other categories not previously mentioned in Annex 1 or 2,I percentage reductions would not be applied, but otherwise theI Procedure in paragraphs 3 and k of the main ground rules would apply.
Worth em I rel and12.    Items included in the Northern Ireland main programme should betreated in the same way as the analogous items in other programmes.Generaj;13,   The following points should be noted by way of interpretation of the main ground rules:-a. In certain programmes, adjustments were made in Cpmd 5879,for presentational reasons, between the approved expendituretotals and the contingency reserve.    In these cases, anyreferences to the &quot;White Paper figures&quot; should be taken to mean the underlying policy figures approvedby Ministers beforethe White Paper was published.b. The items referred to in paragraph H of the main ground-rules which were not costed on a year-by-year basis before thepublication of Cmnd 5879, are: selective assistance and other industrial support; Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies;public ownership of aircraft and shipbuilding industries and ports and road haulage; National Enterprise Board: capitalexpenditure of British National Oil Corporation; and communityownership of development land0
