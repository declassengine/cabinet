IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT0(75) 62 COPY NO     gg19 May 1975CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND ECONOMIC STRATEGYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. Until now the programming and control of public expenditure hasbeen unsatisfactory in two respects.    First, Ministers have not givenadequate time to considering how the Governmenfs economic, social andpolitical priorities should be reflected in distributing the total sum whichcan be allocated to public expenditure in the light of the likely growth of output and the claims of exports, investment and privately financedconsumption.    Second, successive governments have failed to ensurethat programmes are adequately controlled once they are in operation.2. I have asked the Treasury to approach other Departments to see how far it may be possible to supplement planning in constant prices fora five-year period with the establishment of cash limits for expenditurein the first year of the period; with inflation at current rates a move inthis direction is essential, although it will not remove the need for policy decisions to keep the real volume of expenditure under control. So faras local government expenditure is concerned we hope to achieve moresuccess through the new consultative machinery.3. On the determination of priorities within the total sum allocated to public expenditure, the Prime Minister&apos;s proposals should permit ina normal year a rational approach by considering the total sum permissiblein the light of the Medium Term Assessment and then going on to considerthe general distribution of expenditure within, that sum.    This year wecannot wait for this discussion before starting the normal interdepartmentalwork which leads up to the publication of the White Paper in December.I am therefore inviting my colleagues in an accompanying paper to agreenow on some ground rules for this year&apos;s Survey of public expenditure.4. Before considering the prospects for the economy in the medium term so far as they can be judged in advance of the MTA, it is perhapsworth considering some general features of the position from which westart.    First, public expenditure in Britain has been steadily increasingas a percentage of GDP from 42 per cent in 1955 to 45 per cent in 1965
and 58 per cent in 1975.    Taxes have been steadily increasing to cover the cost.    Income tax alone now takes 18. 9 per cent of the average earnings of a married man with two children compared with 5. 6 per cent10 years ago.    The number of income taxpayers as a percentage of theworking population is now 82 per cent compared with 77 per cent in 1965and 69 per cent in 1955.5.        Nevertheless the public sector as a whole is raising far less in revenue than it is spending and lending.    This year the public sectorborrowing requirement is expected to be over  9, 000 million or about10 per cent of GDP.    In a nutshell, central and local government,together with the nationalised industries, are spending or on-lending to others, 19p in the   more than they are receiving in revenue.    Thisabnormally large deficit in the public accounts is in part reflected in a balance of payments deficit which amounted last year to 5 per cent of thenational income.    The nation as a whole is living 5 per cent above itsmeans.    The deficit on the public accounts may not be the sole cause ofthe deficit on the balance of payments, but a lasting improvement in thebalance of payments cannot be achieved unless the public sector deficit is substantially reduced.6. Last autumn it seemed possible to go rather slowly towardsremoving our balance of payments deficit.    But our high rate of inflation -twice that of most industrial countries - threatens our continued ability to find overseas finance for our deficit.7. Many, though not all of our problems, are created by ourexcessive rate of wage inflation.    Until we devise policies to bring thisdown, the whole of our economic policy will suffer exceptional constraints.For example, as long as wage settlements run at current levels I cannot afford even to consider a more expansionary budgetary policy.    Yet,quite apart from its social and moral unacceptability, unemployment alsoimposes severe economic costs.    As it is, I have to aim at returningtowards full employment on the back of a substantial increase in our exports during the expected recovery in world trade next year.    But this in turn depends on maintaining our international competitiveness;  and tomaintain it in the face of wage inflation by successive depreciation of theparity itself inflates domestic prices and costs, and makes borrowing moredifficult.8.        But even if we could get wage inflation under control, our economy would still be dangerously unbalanced.    It is normal to analyse public expenditure in terms of the allocation of real resources, ie the distributionof goods and services between the balance of payments and investment,public expenditure, and privately financed consumption.    It is possible toapply similar reasoning to the financial balances in the economy and I am,as asked, circulating a note by officials which explains some of the complexrelationships between resource imbalances, the public sector borrowing requirement and the public sector deficit (PSD).    The two approachesshould be complementary, different sides of the same coin.2
9. In considering the financial balance in the economy, I concentrate on the PSD.    The PSD is some measure of the Governmenfs excess claim on resources.    It is common ground that a PSD of around 8 per cent ofthe national income  7. 6 billion in 1975-76) is not consistent with balanceof payments equilibrium unless the other two sectors of the economy -companies and persons - are willing to save in excess of their capitalexpenditure far greater proportions of their incomes than they have everdone in the past.    There is no reason to expect such a major change inhabits - nor indeed to wish it so far as companies are concerned, since this would reduce productive capital investment to unacceptable levels.If the Government persisted in raising insufficient taxation to pay forthe resources it was extracting from the economy, the other sectorswould one way or another be left with excessive income which they wouldbe likely to spend, and would in turn absorb resources from the rest ofthe world.    It therefore follows that if we are to remove our balance ofpayments deficit over a run of years and make room for the extraexports required we must reduce the excess of public spending overpublic sector revenue.10.       We are running at the moment well below full capacity output,and all the imbalances to which I have drawn attention would look far better if, as we intend, we can return towards full employment on the back of an increase in exports.    National income and government revenue would both be greater, and the PSD and the balance of payments deficitwould both be smaller.    But this alone would not do the trick.    very substantial imbalances would still remain.    And these imbalances wouldhave to be removed by increasing the proportion of Government spendingwhich is met by taxation.11.       As I pointed out before the Budget in arguing for public expenditure cuts in 1976-77, it is unlikely that we could finance the White Paperexpenditure programmes later in the decade without increasing taxrevenues by an amount equivalent to something like lOp in the &amp; on incometax.   This would mean income tax alone taking 25.1 per   cent of theaverage earnings of a married man with two children and the poorersection of our people beginning to pay income tax at the marginal rateof 45 per cent.    I do not believe this would be socially just or economicallytolerable; it would for example enormously stimulate the wage-pricespiral.    The problem cannot be avoided by soaking the rich.    If weconfiscate all taxable income above  6, 000 a year (just over twiceaverage earnings) we would raise - once for all - about  450 million asagainst our current public sector deficit of  7.6 billion.12.       It was this which led me in the preparation of my Budget to urgemy colleagues to agree to public expenditure cuts for 1976-77, and I am sure that those decisions will make for a more viable economic strategyin the next two years.    It is clearly possible that more will have to bedone for the period 1975-77.    But we must now look ahead, and ensurethat our imbalances can be eliminated within the lifetime of this parliament.    As explained in the attached paper by officials, the economic3
outlook has deteriorated in several respects since last year&apos;s public expenditure White Paper was prepared.    In particular, it is unwise to assume that our GDP will grow as fast as then expected and we mustplan to remove our balance of payments deficit faster.    It is alwayspossible that circumstances will improve, but I believe it is right not toerr on the side of over-optimism - particularly an over-optimism basedon assumptions about the effect of new policies which we have eithernot yet adopted or not yet tested in operation.13.       Ministers will wish to read my memorandum on public expenditure before deciding what guidelines we should give to officialsfor this year&apos;s Public Expenditure Survey.    In my view realismrequires us to recognise that the level of public expenditure in 1978-79will have to be at least  2 billion at 1974 Survey prices below the white paper projections, and the need for a bigger reduction cannot be ruled out.14.       Some of the figuring from which this order of magnitude is derived is summarised in the final paragraph of the attached paper by officials.D W treasury Chambers19 May 19754
1     This paper discusses medium-term economic prospects as a background to public expenditure planning.     It begins with asummary of the medium-term assessment (MTA) projectionsprepared last autumn for incorporation in the Public ExpenditureUnite Paper (Grand 5879):    it then suggests that medium-term     s -prospects should now be viewed more pessimistically than last autumn;   and it finally indicates how the change of prospectsmay affect the outlook for public expenditure and taxation.The White Paper2     Like its predecessors the White Paper contained a summaryof the economic background to the public expenditure programmesaIn the central case the growth of GDP 1973-79 was put at 3 per cent per annum;   on the assumption that the current account of thebalance of payments would have to be back in equilibrium by theend of the decade the growth of &apos;free resources&apos; - resources available for public expenditure and private consumption - came to about 1$ per cent per annum.     With the public expenditure programmes as set out in the White Paper, this implied an average annual rate of growth of privately-financed consumption 1975-79of only just over 1 per cent per annum.3     The White Paper also showed the consequences of a higherend lower rate of growth of GDP.     In the higher growth case(average rate of growth of GDP 1973-79 of 3  per cent per annum)privately-financed consumption increased by about 1  per cent per annum.     In the lower growth case (2-J per cent per annum1973-79) privately-financed consumption rose by only 0.4- per cent a year.    The White Paper implied that, if there was any economic BACKGROUND to public EXPENDITURE IN THE MEDIUM-TERMPaper &quot;by Officials
divergence from the central case, the Government regarded the lower growth case as the more likely alternative;it also warned that on any of the growth variants theburden of taxation would be likely to increase.4      Another way of considering the problem of the economy is in terms of the Government&apos;s own financial accounts -the public sector deficit (PSD) and the public sectorborrowing requirement (PSBR).     The estimate for thecurrent year is a PSD of about 8 per cent of GDP (and about 10 per cent for the PSBR/GDP ratio);   the MTAwhite Paper projections suggest that by 1979 it might beback to about 2 or 3 per cent, roughly consistent with what some economists would regard as necessary for thesuccess of our economic policy.     But it is unlikelythat this reduction in the PSD/GDP ratio could be achieved without either increases in taxation or reductions in public expenditure programmes.The Deterioration of Prospects5      The cautious wording of the White Paper reflected a growing view even at the time of publication that some oxthe assumptions underlying the &apos;central&apos; case were infact biased on the optimistic side.     The main points a tissue are summarized below:   they relate to -(i)   the rate of growth of GDP;   and(ii)   the requirements of the balanceof payments.CONFIDENTIAL
n9      In sum, 3 per cent growth 1973-79 no longer looks a central assumption for GDP.(ii)   Balance of Payments10    The second main point concerns the balance of payments0Here there has been a change of objectivee     The White paper had assumed that balance need not be restored until the endof. the decade;   moreover, the path showed large deficits onthe way, which would have meant considerable furtheradditions to the UK&apos;s already large cumulative externalindebtedness.    . As the Chancellor&apos;s Budget Statementpointed out, the consequences of such a course haveincreasingly become unacceptable in terms of the risksit would involve to our economic sovereignty;    it istherefore essential to allow for a more rapid return toexternal balance.     The problem of achieving this isexacerbated by the further delay now expected in the fullflow of oil from the North-Sea,Consequences for Public Expenditure and Taxation11    The more.-stringent balance of payments objective andthe reduction in the assumed rate of growth of GDP willsignificantly reduce the estimate of total resourcesbecoming available for domestic purposes during theperiod.     No firm figures can be offered at the present stage, because the new MTA - which will incorporatethese changes - is only just getting under way, and will need information from the 1975 expenditure survey before it can be completed.     However, the nature of the problemsahead can be illustrated as follows.
CONFIDENTIAL12    The points made in paragraphs 6-9&apos;suggest that the lowergrowth case of the White Paper - 2-J per cent per annum 1973-79 -now represents a more reasonable central assumption.     On this basis, and even before account is taken of the greater need forstringency on the balance of payments side, there would be room for only negligible growth in privately-financed consumption1973-79.13    From a more up-to-date base year - say, 1975 - the position may look easier*     Because we start with a greater margin&apos;ofslack the rate of growth of GDP 1975-79 would be higher thanthe 2-J per cent assumed for the 1973-79 period;   moreover,privately-financed consumption is likely to register a fall&quot;between 1973 and 1975* and this would suggest that there couldbe some countervailing increase between 1975 and 1979? consistently with the assumptions -in paragraph 12 above..- . **14    However, at unchanged tax rates the growth of private consumption would very likely be far greater than the modestcatching-up just referred to;   in other words, substantial taxincreases would still be called for, unless the 1973/79 public expenditure programmes were reduced.   1 JDhese tax increases canbe expressed in the form of the rise in income tax rates,assuming that income tax allowances are uprated in line with inflation and that indirect taxes are also, where appropriate,raised in line with prices.     On these assumptions, on thebasis of the 1974/75 tax rates, the necessary rise in income taxrates by 1979 works out, very roughly, at 10-12 pence;   the basic rate would then be 43-45 pence.     (This is the equivalent of a standard rate of 11s to 11s6d in the   under the old system.)
15    The tax increases in the 1975 Budget will probably have gone only a limited way towards meeting these tax requirements;in other words, the indications are that further large taxincreases would be needed if the 1978/79 public expenditure programmes remain unchanged.16    As indicated in paragraph 12, these broad estimates allownothing for greater stringency on the balance of payments side.The effect of aiming for more rapid progress towards balanceon external account would be to depress the growth of privately-financed consumption and to increase the required rise in the&quot;burden of taxation.     However, in advance of the new.MTA work it is not possible to be more precise.CONCLUSIONS ,17    Ministers will wish to reflect on the figuring in this paper in coming to their decisions on the PESC guidelines.Many considerations will be relevant but the one to whichthis paper has been addressed is the consequence forprivately-financed consumption, and therefore for the taxburden, of the White Paper public expenditure programmes.It follows from the last paragraph that no firm indicationcan at present be given of the size of public expenditurereductions by the end of the Survey period necessary to ease the prospective burden on the consumer by some chosenamounts^     However, with the help of the White Paper MTAprojections the scale of the problem can be illustrated intwo alternative ways.     If the aim were to bring the burdenof taxation back to its 1974/75 level a very substantialcut would be required in public expenditure for the year1979 &quot; perhaps rather more than  3 billion at 197^ Survey
Annexpage 7prices.     Alternatively, if the objective were to restore the1^- per cent per annum average rate of growth of privately-financed consumption over the period 1973-79 which theCabinet took to be a reasonable planning assumption last summer, the necessary reduction in the 1979 public expenditurelevel would come to about  2-  billion.     For the financialyear 1978/79 the equivalent figure would be, say,  2% billionwith the first approach and about  2 billion with the .&apos;second,      .     .     , , , ^HM Treasury9 May 1975
