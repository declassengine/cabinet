SECRETDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT0(75) 58 COPY NO       8212 May 1975CABINETEXPORT OF ARMS SPARES AND EQUIPMENT TO SOUTH africa memorandum by the Secretary of State for trade. My memorandum C(75) 47 related only to spare parts.    I should however like to raise in the discussion two other items referred to belowwhich seem to me to be particularly sensitive, and on which the Defence and oversea Policy Committee were divided.DECCA DOPPLER AIR NAVIGATION RADAR2.        The Defence and Oversea Policy Committee agreed that dual purposeequipment whose intended use was known to be exclusively military should beconsidered individually.    Under this head the Committee considered twosuch applications for navigation equipment in military aircraft, one forMarconi-Elliott navigation computers ( 297, 000) and one for Decca radar( 85, 000).    The Marconi export was agreed, but the Committee took intoaccount the fact that a contract was placed for the equipment at the beginningof 1974, and that the South African Government had already paid 30 per cent of the cost.    In the case of the Decca Doppler equipment, no such firmcontract exists and no payment has been made.    I consider that in thesecircumstances there is no justification for allowing the export of this newequipment which is clearly destined for use in military planes.GAS MASKS3, These have been regarded as &quot;ancillary&quot; equipment but the classification is not free from doubt.    One application for export isoutstanding, value  19, 000, for 1200 gas masks, canisters, etc. destined for the South African Navy.    These are of a military specification, and of atype which could be used in anti-riot situations.    Although the application is,I understand, covered by an existing contract, I think that we should bejustified in rejecting the export, given the sensitive nature of the equipment.4.        I invite my colleagues to agree that the export of these two itemsshould be refused.P department of Trade12 May 1975
