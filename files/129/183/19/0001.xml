-TOMFinFfvlTI AlHIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYlS GOVERNMENT9C(75) 69 COPY NO u&quot;17 June 1975CABINETINDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for trade. It has become clear from discussions in the Lord ChancellorsGroup of Ministers that the alternative to setting up an independent committee of Inquiry into employee participation at board level is for theGovernment to publish a Green or White Paper to be followed by legislation in 1976*77.    This might be accompanied by an inquiry by officials (possibly with expert legal assistance) into the company law implications.2. A Green or White Paper which was to serve as the basis for subsequent legislation would need to set out proposals by the Governmentfor a. range of substantive issues of great importance which need to besettled before legislation can be prepared.    These include:a. The responsibilities of directors, including employeedirectors.    This involves taking a fresh look at the role and responsibilities of companies, and an examination of the part whichemployee directors should play*b. How employee directors should be elected - the problems of representation of non-unionised employees, the arrangements for elections in multi-union situations, whether the directors should beemployers of the company etc.c. How many employee directors there should be and what proportion of the board they should constitute.d. Whether the two-tier system of supervisory and managementboards should be introduced into this country with employeerepresentation on the supervisory boards,e. What to do about representation of interests other thanemployees and shareholders.1
3. It is not enough to consider these matters only from a theoreticalpoint of view, or to confine examination to the implications for companylaw.    We are dealing here with changes which will profoundly affect theway in which industry is run.    We must therefore be concerned with theeffect of these changes upon the way in which companies operate from day to day, and how in turn industrial efficiency and productivity will beaffected.    We must aim to sustain and improve industrial confidence duringthe critical period for our economy which lies ahead.    Some measure ofemployee representation on boards is being increasingly accepted on theContinent without a breakdown in confidence and indeed arguably withbeneficial effects.    But the process in these countries has been a gradualone and is linked to wider developments in industrial relations,    I do notthink we can draw the conclusion from this experience that a sudden leap to50 per cent employee representation in this country could be made with similar ease.4. In my view the Government will face severe difficulties in formulating satisfactory proposals if their preparation is entrusted to an internal group of officials,    I very much doubt whether an internal inquiry would have the benefit of detailed evidence from the Confederation ofBritish Industry, Trades Union Congress and other interested parties, and it certainly would not afford adequate opportunity for probing their evidence.An internal inquiry would be seen to be incapable of drawing on the breadth of experience which is needed.    Its conclusions would therefore be seen to lack authority,5. Where there is fundamental disagreement on an issue of major political and economic importance - and the trade union leaders themselveshold widely differing views - it is better for the Government to reach a judgment after a process which enables the advantages and disadvantages of options to be set out authoritatively in a manner calculated to encouragepublic debate.    There can surely be no doubt that an independent inquiry,holding its proceedings in public and leading to a careful assessment of the options would carry greater conviction than any alternative course.    Itsreport would therefore provide the best opportunity for reaching a degreeof consensus among the opposing views and for achieving the solution whichsuits our own needs and conditions and which offers the best prospects of strengthening and stimulating our industry.P department of Trade17 June 19752
