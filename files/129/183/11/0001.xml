THE DEFINITION AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR DEFICITAND BORROWING REQUIREMENTNote by OfficialsDefinitions1.     There are two related concepts, the public sector deficit(PSD) and the public sector borroxtfing requirement (PSBR) whichconsists of the PSD plus transactions in financial assetssuch as the loans to the Building Societies and the purchaseof BP shares.   As explained below the former is mor significant in relation to resource allocation and management,and the latter in relation to the monetary impact of financing the public sector.(a)   The Public Sector Deficit2.     The financial surplus, or deficit, of the public sector,like that of other sectors of the economy, represents theextent by which the sector1s surplus on current account - itssavings - is sufficient, or insufficient, to finance itscapital expenditure.   To the extent that a sector is insurplus, this will be matched by the acquisition of financialassets; to the extent that it is in deficit, by the incurringof financial liabilities.   In the case of the overseassector, its surplus is the counterpart of (ie equal andopposite to) this country&apos;s balance of payments deficit on current account.   Since one person&apos;s financial asset is another&apos;s financial liability, the financial balances of thefour main sectors - the public sector, the personal sector,the company sector and the overseas sector - must bydefinition sum to zero (errors and   oinissions excepted).confidential
Thus the sum of the three domestic sectors must be equal tothe current balance of payments deficit (or surplus).   Ingeneral the private sector as a whole&apos;has tended to be on surplus,with the personal sector in sufficient surplus to offset thefact that the company sector is more often in deficit thanin surplus.   The public sector is generally in deficit, whilethe overseas sector mirrors our balance of payments position- recently it has &quot;been in surplus.(b)   The Public Sector Borrowing Requirement3*     The public sector&apos;s borrowing requirement exceeds thepublic sector deficit, not only because the sector needs toalsoborrow to finance its deficit, but/because it is a net lenderSO n.to the other sectors and^/needs to finance its own lending to others - at home and abroad - and to finance its acquisitionof company securities.   Table 1 shows the figures for boththe deficit and the borrowing requirement for recent years.Table 1PSBH and PSD  million1972-731973-741974-75EstimatedOutturn1975-76Post-BudgetForecast250450-   15080070025050500650250100PSBR2,550(4c 5)4,450(7=0)7,600(10.0)9,050(9.9)(as % of GDP)
The annex describes the difficulties involved in forecastingthe PSBR in a period of rapid inflation, and gives a break-down in Table 2, of the reasons for the changes in the PSBRestimates during 1974-75*The significance of the Public Sector Deficit4-.     The public sector deficit (PSD) derives its importance from the fact that it is a measure of the impact ofGovernment current and capital expenditures and taxation onthe economy.   Although it would be unsafe in the present state of knowledge to formulate precise targets, we canarrive at certain broad conclusions which indicate a sensiblegeneral objective in this field.   In order to reach a situation later this decade in which the balance of paymentsdeficit (&quot;financial surplus of the overseas sector&quot;) hasdisappeared, we must have got the PSD to a level where itcan be matched by a continuing stable financial surplus ofthe private sector of our economy.   Experience so farsuggests that we cannot reasonably expect this to be muchmore than about 3 per cent of GDP over a period of years.This compares with a PSD of about 8 per cent of GDP in bothJ-y/T-f^    CU1U . . ...       ......- ,The need for sectoral balance5.     To the extent to which the PSD is in excess of thisthelong-term target, the Government accounts are liable to throw^rest of the economy into disequilibrium: either the privatez
sector (companies and persons) must save higher proportions of their incomes than they have ever saved for a sustainedperiod in the past or the balance of payments deficit willbe higher than we can afford to accept over a run of years.Either way the situation will not be viable.   The other twodomestic sectors cannot be forced to adjust their financialbehaviour so as to accommodate the needs of the public sector: consumers and companies will not be prepared to holdpaper assets so as to enable the public sector to command a greater share of resources than the Government is preparedto pre-empt through taxation.   If they find their financialbalances improving rapidly, as a consequence of a large PSD,they will react by spending more either on consumption orinvestment.   They will not be prepared to lend without limit to the public sector.   The public sector must therefore,over time, match its deficit to what the other sectors areprepared to finance: in present circumstances this meanscutting public expenditure and/or increasing taxation,either of which will reduce the PSD.   Getting the public accounts into some better balance is therefore a measure ofthe extent to which we are getting our national physicalresources into balance.   It is not a question of settingprecise equilibrium &quot;targets&quot; for the PSD.   The approach is rather in terms of achieving the necessary disposition of real resources which will permit the required outcome forthe balance of payments.   (Resource availability is of coursenot the only necessary condition involved; price etccompetitiveness is also essential, and in addition micro-
economic measures may be necessary).   But it is alwayspossible and often revealing to examine the implications of any policy for resource use in terms of its likelyeffect on the PSD, and this was done in some paragraphs of the Budget Statement.The pace of adjustment6.        If the pattern of sectoral financial balances were near the proportions which had prevailed up to a year or two ago and if changes in these balances from year to year were relatively small, there would be room for considerabledispute about the likely effect - and in particular the timing of the effect - of, for instance, a projected changein PSDc   Some economists (the &quot;new Cambridge&quot; school) wouldconfidently predict an equivalent change in the overseasbalance fairly soon; others would doubt this, and would think it quite possible that there should be offsettingchanges in the private sector balances .   With the enormousimbalances which we have now reached, however, the scope fornice arguments of this type does not exist.   There is noquestion that we have to restore balance - the question is,how quickly?   The Budget has made a start.   But we willhave to go further and we may have to go faster.CONPIDENTIAL
COITPIDEMflALA &quot;full employment&apos; PSD7.     For given tax rates and levels of public expenditure, thePSD will be smaller if the level of activity in the economy is higher: for example income tax yields will be higher and unemployment benefit payments less if unemployment is reduced.The concept of a &apos;full employment&apos; PSD has therefore evolved,as being what the PSD would be if the economy was running atthe maximum practicable level of resource use, ie &quot;full employment&quot;.   In principle, a target value for the PSD for a run of years should be determined in terms of what the &quot;full employment&quot; PSD should be in those years, rather than whatthe PSD at the actual level of activity would be.   Eut it isnot possible to calculate a unique value for a &quot;full employment&quot; PSD because there are in principle severalpossible figures depending on what assumptions are made about ,how the full employment situation would be achieved: the PSDwould be different if full employment were achieved viaexport-led growth than if it were brought about by consumerssaving less and spending more.8.    But this does not mean that a fiscal relaxation to stimulate activity can lead to a lower PSD, because the direct costs of the tax cuts or increased public expenditureintroduced to reflate the economy would increase the PSD bysignificantly more than the subsequent reduction due to thehigher activity.   Fiscal relaxation would inevitably cause anet increase in the PSD.aCOHPIDMITIAL
^^significance of the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement9.     The PSBR - the second of the two concepts dealt with inthis paper - is also significant in a number of contexts *First, many of the lending transactions that contribute toit (but are excluded from the public sector deficit) can have an important influence on the liquidity of the private sector, and so can affect spending and external capital flows.Secondly, the financing of a large borrowing requirement canpose problems for monetary management, which again haveimplications for the real economy and external flows.Thirdly, it has &apos;come to be considered by outside observersas an indication of the Government&apos;s budgetary stance, andso can be critical to confidence.The effect of net lending10 c   The action of the Government lending to one part of the economy, and then borrowing from another part to finance it,can have direct and indirect resource effects.   The recipient&apos;may well use the loan to finance expenditure which he couldnot otherwise have financed: indeed that may be the purposeof that loan.   Subsequently the addition to the totalliquidity of the private sector may give rise to further expenditure.   The increase in liquidity may in additionreduce the inflow of funds from abroad (or increase theoutflow) by, for example, changing the leads and lags in commercial payments.7
Financing the PSBR11.   The PSBR is financed in. three main ways - by sales of debt to the public outside the banking system (eg gilts,national savings, local authority mortgages), by externaltransactions - which include not only direct government borrowing, but the effect of changes in the reserves on the sterling assets of the Exchange Equalisation Account - andby borrowing from the banking system-   The extent to whichit is possible to achieve the first depends on confidence,the level of interest rates and expectations about futureinterest rates.   It may be possible to increase the amountsfinanced in this way for example by raising interest rates,but this would have unfortunate consequences for some of our other objectives, particularly in relation to housing andindustry.   Moreover, within the next year or two we shallhave to limit the extent to which we sell public sector debt to the financial institutions, such as insurance companies,so that they can have funds available to invest in industry as the economy recovers.   Thus an excessive PSBR could be aconstraint on industrial investment.12.   The extent of external finance of the borrowing requirement is not something that can easily be manipulated by us.To a very large extent it is the consequence of our externaldeficit.   In the simplest case, in which the externaldeficit is financed by losses of reserves, the public sectorreceives a corresponding inflow of sterling finance.   Butthis is obviously not a form of financing that we would8t/UJW-D XJJStsLH Tjuuj
desire.   Borrowing abroad by nationalised industries andlocal authorities does not in itself help to finance thePSBR, since these bodies require sterling for theirspending and the authorities have to provide this in exhange for the foreign currencies.    (The purpose of suchborrowing is to bolster the reserves, not to finance thepublic sector),1J.   This leaves the balance of the borrowing requirement tobe financed through the banking system: this adds to themoney supply directly and can also lead, through increasingthe reserve asset base of the banks, to a further increasein the money supply if countervailing action is not taken bythe monetary authorities.Implications for money supply14. The exact significance of changes in the money supply for the real economy is hotly disputed between economists.But there is little doubt that the rapid increase in 1972and 1973 added to inflationary pressures. It is important to ensure that increases in the money supply should not beallowed to fuel inflation again.15c   Moreover, there is considerable evidence that changesin the liquidity of the private sector, and particularly the corporate sector, can both affect its level of activity and for the reasons explained above, have marked effectsVUiU&apos; XX/XlU J. JLttJJ
upon flows of funds from abroad and hence on the sterlingexchange rate and/or the way we finance our external deficit.16.   A large public sector borrowing requirement can thereforeleave the Government with a choice of raising interest rates to attract funds from the institutions (thus reducing theamount available for industry) or risking a growth in theliquidity of the private sector that could add to inflation and to the difficulties of financing our external deficit.Effect on confidence17.   In addition, the public sector borrowing requirementhas come to assume an importance in the eyes of financialmarkets at home and abroad that is greater than it probablyjustifies.   This is in part due to the fact that the overseas markets do not understand the details of ourbudgetary strategy, and are looking for some convenientsingle indicator - the PSBK is the best available.   the size of the PSBS can therefore have a significant effect on confidence in sterling, and the willingness of our overseascreditors to go on lending to us.   This may be irrational,but cannot be ignored as long as we are having to borrow to finance our external deficit.10CONFIDENTIAL
Forecasting the PSD and PSBRThe public sector deficit, like the other sector surplusesand deficits, and the public sector borrowing requirementare difficult to forecast accurately.   They are all balancesbetween large aggregates, so that errors in one of theseaggregates can lead to proportionately much larger errorsin the balance.   The margins of error are much larger than usual at present because of the substantial relativemovements in costs and revenues in a time of rapid inflation.2.     The difficulties are brought out by the analysis in   -Table 2 of the changes in the estimates- of&quot;the-PSD and PSBR iny\Qr7h.-.r?^ between the Budget in March &quot;1974 and now:   the analysis is based on preliminary returns, and there may even now be further significant changes, particularly inrespect of local authorities.   The total increase in each xasewas some  5 billion.   Half of this,  2-J billion, was becausethe rate of general inflation was substantially higherthan forecast in March 1974, and because the increase was particularly concentrated in the public sector.   The higherlevels of money incomes and expenditure increased taxrevenue by some  800 million.   But price changes increasedpublic expenditure directly by some  2,250 million - about one half of this was due to the higher increases in -public sector costs than in costs generally, for example wage increases to teachers, nurses and others which included asubstantial element of making good ground lost in previous years.   In addition the higher rate of inflation underlayan increase of more than  1 billion in subsidies, including
price restraint compensation to the nationalised industries -and housing subsidies.5.     This error arising from inflation &quot;being greater thananticipated was greater than the effect of policy changesduring the year, which added just tinder  2 billion to thePSBR.   The Chancellor&apos;s July measures and. November budgetadded    1,150 million.   A range of decisions to increasepublic expenditure - such as the pensioners&apos; Christmasbonus and the rescue of Court Line, Crown Agents.and Burmahoil - added some  750 million.4.     It would appear from the provisional figures so far   .&apos;available that the level of public expenditure on purchasinggoods and services increased by  1,000 million more than can be accounted for by price changes and policy changes.Three quarters of this overspend was by local authorities -a disturbing figure.5.     The fact that employment was higher than anticipatedimproved the revenue by some  400 million, but this v/aslargely offset by higher interest payments due to theincrease&apos; in the borrowing requirement.    For the rest, thenet effect of the numerous other changes in individualitems was to reduce the estimated change by nearly  500million.
