DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY5S government(75) 6420 May 1975CABINETTEXTILE imports memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster. At the Prime Ministers request a Ministerial Group under my chairmanship has considered a proposal by the Secretary of State for industry to reduce imports of textiles and clothing to 20 per cent below their 1974 level by means of quota restrictions for a period of at least one year, as is urged by the British Textile Confederation (BTC).    TheSecretary of State subsequently modified his proposal to exclude from quota restrictions those sectors (including woollen and worsted yarns and fabrics)where import penetration is low.    His modified proposal relates to sectorsin which imports are currently at around  900 million a year and exportsat around  700 million a year.    Some details of exports, imports and import penetration in these sectors are shown in the Annex.2f        Between 1965 and 1973 employment in textiles fell from 717, 000 to555, 000 (an annual drop of about Z\ per cent) and in clothing from 381, 000to 333, 000 (an annual drop of about if per cent).    The current recessionhas accelerated the fall in employment to 506, 000 by February 1975 intextiles and to 313, 000 in clothing.    In April 1975 there were 18, 600unemployed in textiles and 8, 400 in clothing, and the increase since october 1974 would appear to be slightly worse in these industries than forthe economy as a whole.    In addition the Department of Employmentestimate that 4,9 per cent of the labour force in textiles and 1.5 per centin clothing are on regular short-time working.3.        As will be seen from the Annex, in the sectors covered by theSecretary of State&apos;s modified proposal, during 1974 home production fellsharply, exports declined and imports rose:  so far this year importpenetration,  though mostly still higher than in 1973, has generally fallenbelow the average level of 1974.    There has been no further decline inactivity in our textile and clothing industries this year as compared with1974, but the industry foresee no prospect of an upturn before the autumn,and even this is by no means certain.COPY NO      Q 00 h)1
4.        The main arguments in favour of the Secretary of State&apos;s modifiedproposal are:-a. It would go most of the way to meet the BTCs request, andwould demonstrate the Governmenfs willingness to help an industry with special difficulties,b. It would be seen to be directed at a major factor which isnow adding to the industry*s difficulties.c. If successful, it would remove the danger of the loss ofindustrial capacity and employment opportunities which could be usedwhen the present world recession ends.5.        The main arguments against the modified proposal are:-a. It would almost certainly lead to retaliation by otherdeveloped countries who provide a large proportion of our textileimports, all of whom are under domestic pressure to restrainimports and some of whom, like the USA, Germany, Belgium andthe Netherlands are suffering more unemployment or productioncuts in textiles than we are.    If these countries retaliated by restricting our textiles, the net result on our textile industry could wellbe worse; if the retaliation applied to our other exports, we wouldhave more unemployment in our other industries, with perhaps more serious effects on the assisted areas.    Recently, Britaindiscriminated again&amp;t imports from Turkey, but within our international obligation, and only to prevent an increase, not toimpose a reduction; Turkey retaliated, beyond the textile field,and our loss in engineering jobs offset the jobs saved in textiles.b. The Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) would be criticallyeroded.    The MFA does not permit reducing low-cost importsfrom developing countries below current levels, but it virtuallyprotects our textile industry from increases in such imports.To lose this protection would be a serious blow for the longer term.c. The proposal would run completely counter to our policy towards the developing world, and in particular jeopardise thePrime Ministers Kingston initiative and the prospects of anyaccommodation with the Third World on energy.d. The proposal would have some adverse effect on prices inthe home market.6.        The group also considered other possible means of helping the textile industry.    We concluded that zero-rating for Value Added Tax,apart from costing some  350 million, would not help as it would apply alsoto imported goods.    There are no hire purchase restrictions on the sectors2
covered by the modified proposal.    Repayable loans of say  50 million for stock building could be made under the Indixstry Act to encourageproduction, but this is opposed by Treasury Ministers.    In the longer term some marginal help might be possible through public sectorpurchasing and &quot;Buy British&quot; measures concerted by the two sides of the textile business.    The industry should be encouraged to make full use of anti-dumping procedures but we would not expect this to make a significant impact on imports.7. The general opinion in the group was that -a. There should be no restrictions in sectors where there is comparatively little import penetration,b. There should be no restrictions on imports from developing countries.c. In view of our international obligations, we should not propose restrictions discriminating against developed countries:besides the doubtful legality of such action, retaliation, not confined to textiles and clothing, is likely to leave us as badly or worse off.8. The majority of the group hoped that consideration could be givento other means of helping the textile and clothing industry, of the sortdescribed in paragraph 6 above.    I recommend that the group be invitedto pursue urgently the possibility of loans under the Industry Act to help the industry with stock building and in other ways.H LCabinet Office20 May 19753
