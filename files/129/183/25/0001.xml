[document IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 75 COPY NO 827 July 1975CABINETNEW PARLIAMENTARY building memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment and the Lord President of the council. This paper seeks to clarify policy on the future of the newParliamentary building,    A background note (Annex A) is attached,2.        A decision is needed urgently,    Messrs Spence and Webster, whohave no other major commissions and have built up a design office on theassumption that they would be fully committed on the new Parliamentarybuilding, need either i, to be told that further work on the scheme is to beundertaken, which would involve at least  400, 000 over the next two years;or ii, to be paid off.    Under the competition, they would get  8S000 pluspayment for work done under their present limited commission.    But werecommend they also receive reimbursement for commitments they can showwere entered into for the purpose of the new Parliamentary building.Payment would be subject to an overall limit of  100, 000 which was thefigure provided for in 1973 for developing the brief.3,        The order of cost of the building and associated works is at least 30 million at current prices.    This does not include the cost of the site.Now, when economy in building programmes is being urged on localauthorities and others, we cannot expect a scheme for MPb&apos; accommodation of this order of expense to begin in the foreseeable future; nor would it be reasonable to authorise another  400, 000 on preparatory work for it.    Onthe other hand, there are still 138 Members without a proper office; furtherinfilling in the Palace itself is unacceptable (both financially andaesthetically); and the new Parliamentary building site, acquired at a costof  6. 6 million, is partly empty and the buildings on it, because of the uncertainty, are deteriorating,4,        We consider it inevitable that the Spence-Webster building should beindefinitely postponed.    This would be on financial grounds and imply noarchitectural judgment, since the design was selected as a result of acompetition and endorsed by the House of Commons and the Royal Fine art commission, although objected to by the Greater London Council,    The1
scheme would, in any case, have needed modification for reasons no faultof the architects, notably security requirements not envisaged when thecompetition was arranged.5, Indefinite postponement of the Spence-Webster scheme is not enough.Other possibilities are:-a. Offer to rehabilitate the Norman Shaw South building for parliamentary purposes.    It could accommodate 81 MPs,81 secretaries and 38 House of Commons staff.    Rehabilitation toNorman Shaw North standards is estimated to cost l^- lf million and could be completed within two years of adecision.    Although not within the site of the new Parliamentarybuilding as such, Norman Shaw South would have to be demolished tomake way for the new underground station envisaged in theconditions of the architectural competition.    However the advantageof using Norman Shaw South in the near future seems worth the riskof having to demolish it later if Spence-Webster or somethingsimilar were revived.b. Invite the Services Committee to consider, in consultationwith the Department of the Environment, other possibilities for additional accommodation for MPs on the new Parliamentarybuilding site.    The scope of any study to be carried out by theDepartment of the Environment, which might include some     wflexibility with the area to the north, would be agreed with theServices Committee.    A summary of the possibilities forrehabilitation of buildings on the eastern part of the site is given inparagraphs 10-13 of Annex A.c. Investigate the possibility of adapting part of the Speaker&apos;sResidence for Members.6.        We invite our colleagues to agree that:-i. On financial grounds, further expenditure on planning theSpence-Webster building should not be authorised.ii. The Spence-Webster scheme should be indefinitelypostponed.iii. Messrs Spence and Webster should be appropriately paid off.iv. The Services Committee should be invited to consider NormanShaw South and the other possibilities noted above for the earlyprovision of the minimum essential Parliamentary accommodation onthe Bridge Street site and possibly in the Speakerls Residence.2
v. These decisions should be announced as soon as possible interms of the draft statement (Annex B) and a decision whether or notto debate the accommodation problem taken later in the light of theHouse&apos;s reactions.A CE department of the Environment7 July 1975
ME1:? PARLIAMENTARY BUILDING:    BACKGROUND MATERIALTI E PARLIAMENTARY background,    On ?3 Juno 1973 the House of Commons voted for the construction&quot;in due course&quot; of a new Parliamentary building on the site borderedby Bridge Street, Parliament Street, Derby Gate and the Embankment,They also approved by 208 votes to 1 h,t\. the adoption of Messrs Spenceand Webster&apos;s competition winning design.2.   The House was informed that there would be no expenditure on thebuilding during 1973/71-1- or 1974/75 but (Hansard Column 1267)  that the plans might be developed, in the period to April 1975*    AccordinglyMessrs Spence and Webster were given s. limited commission,  to cost nomere than  100,000 fully to establish the clients&apos;  brief.    It hashowever been impossible to make further progress in the absence ofclear instructions from the House.    On 21 March 1974 the Minister ofState for Urban Affairs said that the present Government, had reachedno decision about the building (Hansard Column 1Ll2).    Subsequentsimilar questions were answered in similar terms until 29 January 1975when the Lord President promised a statement as soon as possible.THE SPENCE AND WEBSTER BUILDING3.   The building would provide l\.^0 single rooms for Members and ancillary offices,  social and recreational accommodation linkedby an underground corridor to the Palace of Westminster.    Amenitieswould include a swimming bath,  sauna bath, library, restaurant,television studios and a public concourse.    A Podium would accommodateshops and other public amenities.k&apos;   The site cost  6.6m.    The order of cost of the building and ancillary works is at least  30.0m at current prices.
\3 sIMITIMING5,   The private tenants on the Bridge Street site are entitled to months notice to quite their premises pending demolition.    The majorwork then would be the construction of a new Underground Station on the site or the Norman Shaw South Building.    If a firm decision to proceedwere reached now the pre-tender documentation could be completed intime for this to begin towards the end of 1977 with a probablecompletion date late in 1983/PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS6.   The Greater London Council who consider that the parliamentarybuilding should have been designed together with the proposed Governmentoffice development between Derby Gate and Richmond Terrace have consistently opposed the height, mass and proposed alignment of theSpende Webster building.    Their views were rejected by the services committee in 1972 and by the House in June 1973-    They know thatnormal planning arrangements cannot apply where the client isParliament itself but have continued to press- their arguments.   their co-operation is needed both for the London Transport works and the links under Bridge Street with the Palace of Westminster.WHITEHALL PLANNING7.   The design and timing of the parliamentary building has important implications for the proposed Government development immediately to thenorth which would provide up to 1,200 office places.    The two designsshould be compatible and the two buildings would probably share centra-isect cooling, heating and electrical power plant.   An earlier assumptionthat service access to the basement area of the parliamentary building  &apos;would be by ramps from Richmond Terrace is no longer valid sinceliichmond Terrace and Norman Shaw North are being retained;    but -alternative means of access will have to be agreed if the planning of both schemes is not to be frustrated.    An important minor requirementis to rind an alternative long terra home for the Whitehall Post office at kk Parliament Street - if no early provision for it can be madein the Sponce/Webster building.
IMPLICATIONS OP ABANDONING THE CONSTRUCTION Or THE NEW PARLIAMENTARYBUILDING8.   Should the construction of the new parliamentary building be abandoned, improved facilities for the House will still be needed.Existing facilities are:Single Double Treble Desk TotalRooms Rooms        Rooms        RoomsetcPalace of Westminster 182 1k0 15 159 lj.962 Abbey Garden.6/7 Old Palace Yard, 11 12 9 6k. 963 Dean1 s YardNorman Shaw North 50 78 - - 12821+3 230 2L 22.3 7209.   The number of Members in Desk Rooms etc can now be reduced to 138?but accommodation for secretaries and other staff is still a, major problem.    The Speaker has recently indicated that it might be possiblefor some accommodation in his house to be made available to Members.This offer has been welcomed, and the possibilities are being investigated.    20 Members might be provided for in this way.    Furtherinfilling within the Palace xTOuld be very costly and aestheticallycontroversial:    future schemes would cost  80- l50 per square foot,compared with  30- 36 for building new government offices in central london and  52 for the Spence-Webster building. ,
fpONFinFNTIAI ^V _._^__10.   Other possibilities are:a. rehabilitation of Norman Shaw South on the lines ofNorman Shaw North.    This would within 2 years of a decisionprovide for 8l Members in single or double rooms,  8l secretariesand 38 staff at an order of cost of  l-t- lfm.b. rehabilitation of some or all of the other buildings on theBridge Street site to Norman Shaw North standards.    A recent   .review indicates that the following additional accommodation couldbe provided within 5 years of a decision:-Building Estimated accommodation Order of(single or double rooms) costra.St Stephen&apos;s House 79 MFs:    83 Bees 2f - 398 OthersPalace Chambers 110 MPs:    111. sees11x7 Others^ 13*1 &amp; 2 Bridge Street 53 MPs:    50 sees 2 - 2-r27 Othersc.    rehabilitation of buildings to the extent compatible with thatfor a 5 year occupation as Civil Service offices.II.   Adoption of any of the above alternatives would involve rehousingup to 300 civil servants and giving notice to 26 tenants.    The civilservants are presently located as in the following table (there are nonein 1 and 2 Bridge Street).    At an average of  12,590 a head alternative accommodation in Central London would cost, for the first five years:Building No. of civil servants Rehousing mNorman Shaw South 99 0.8St Stephen5s House 65 0.6Palace Chambers 129 2.3A &apos; 11 11 293 3.7The bulk of this expenditure could be saved if Palace Chambers weredeluded from the scheme for MPs.CONFIDENTIAL
12.   The Services Committee considered the rehabilitation of all these buildings and Norman Shaw North early in 1973 when the order of costwas . 2.05m for   5 years&apos;  tenure and  lt.lm for 20 years.    they considered that the exercise would be uneconomical and they and the Housevoted in favour of the Spence-Webster building.3.3.   Only Norman Shaw South has sufficient architectural merit to justifyindefinite retention.    If it were indefinitely retained, the Spenoe-Ivebster building could never be built but it would be possible to designan alternative building or a building on the rest of the site.    If onlyNorman Shaw South (and,  say, St Stephen1s House) were rehabilitatedfor-MPs the problem of rehousing the civil servants would be.I considerably eased.11].-   The Treasury points out that any expenditure beyond that comparable with keeping three buildings in use for civil service purposes for another $ years (alternative 10c) would appear to be inconsistent withthe Governmenfs expenditure priorities as set out in Cmnd 5879(Public Expenditure to 1978-79).113&apos;.   These issues would all have to be studied in detail if theSpence/Webster scheme is abandoned.
DRAFT STATEMENT OK ACCOMMODATIDATION FOR MEMBERS1,   The House will recall thaton 25 June 1973,  two Motions were approved - the first being in favour in principle of a new Parliajdienuarybuilding in due course, and the second in favour of the particularwas informed by the Rt Hon Member for Lowestoft, as the Leader ofthe House, that no expenditure on the now building would be incurredbefore 1 April 1975* but that the intervening period would, be usedto develop detailed plans.2.   He have now had to consider whether in the present economic circumstances, and at a time of need for stringent economy in expenditure, it would be right to commit further significant public expenditure on a project whose order of cost is now at least  30m,excluding site costs already incurred.    The Government.1.a conclusion is that it would be unrealistic, in. present circumstances to hold out.the prospect of a new Parliamentary building in the foreseeable future. Nor do we think in thesecircumstanc.es that further public expenditure, which might cost up to. -^-m, to enable Messrs Spence andWebster to continue to develop their plans, could be justified.3.   We propose accordingly that the architects&apos; commission shouldbe terminated, immediately and that they should be fairly compensated.This decision is taken reluctantly and on financial grounds.    Iwould like to take this opportunity of thanking the architects forthe unremitting and distinguished work which they have done overthe past two years in extremely difficult circumstances,  and to say how sorry I am personally that it should end in. this way.h-   Against this background the Government fully recognises the design for the biby MessrsSponce and Webster.The House
.,;added urgency and. importance of ox8.mi.ning other means of improving theacconanodatidh available to Members, bearing in mind also theconsideration currently being given to facilities for backbenchers bythe Select Committee under the chairmanship of the lion Member for! o king ham.Considerable progress has, of course, already been made, and since1967 some 210 extra rooms have been, provided, to accommodate about 33&apos;0Members.   This includes the recent conversion of Norman. Shaw (North).,where, in addition to 69 new rooms for 120 Members., accommodation hasbeen provided for some 130 secretaries and also for a number of supporting,services.   Infilling within the Palace has contributed 101  rooms occupiedby 160 Members; and Mr Speaker has recently indicated that it might bepossible for some accommodation in the Speaker&apos;s Residence to be madeavailable to Members,    I have welcomed this offer and we are urgentlyinvestigating the possibilities.   Useful additional accommodation hasalso been provided in Abbey Gardens and Dean&apos;s Yard.    I believe thatthe standard of the new accommodation, particularly that in Norman SHav.(North), has proved generally acceptable to Members,.6;  If the House agrees, I think the best way of making further progress in. present circumstances would be the adaptation of existing buildings on the Parliamentary Building site.    I have particularlyin mind Norman Shaw (South) which, subject to the need to rehouseproperly the present occupants, could provide further accommodationIf or about 80 more Members and a similar number of secretaries within two years of the date of decision.    There are other possibilitiesTor housing up to 2h0 Members and as many secretaries by rehabilitatingIexisting buildings (St Stephens House; Palace Chambers; 1  and 2Bridge Street) .    Rehabilitation could be achieved within five years
of &apos;8 decision to begin.    There is also the possibility of some limited re-building within the site.    All this requires consideration in detail and we must, in formulating proposals, have regard to theneed&apos; t;o limit public expenditure at the present time.7.        The Government will&apos; submit proposals to the Services committee as soon as possible, and if the House so wishes these will includethe very early conversion to the use of Members of the Norman Shaw(South)&apos; building.    Progress beyond this depends very much&apos; on theresolution of our financial problems, but sub 3ect to this we wouldalso be prepared in principle to consider the conversion of at leastny:e of the other buildings on the site. j
