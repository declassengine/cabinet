ForewordIt was announced by the Secretary of State for Industry, the Rt. Hon.Anthony Wedgwood Benn, MP, in the House of Commons on 18th Decem-ber 1974 that the Government had appointed a team, led by Sir Don Ryder,to conduct an overall assessment of the present situation and future prospects of the British Leyland Motor Corporation Limited. Their report was received on 26th March 1975.The following text comprises that Report, edited to remove confidentialmaterial.
26th March, 1975The Rt. Hon. Anthony Wedgwood BennSecretary of State for IndustrySir,We were appointed by you on 18th December, 1974 to conduct, in consultationwith the Corporation and trade unions, an overall assessment of the british leyland Motor Corporation^ present situation and future prospects, coveringcorporate strategy, investment, markets, organisation, employment, productivity,management/labour relations, profitability and finance, and to report to theGovernment.In the course of our Inquiry we have had many meetings with members of theBoard and senior executives of British Leyland and we and our supportingstaff have visited nearly all the Corporation^ plants. We are aware that these discussions and visits and the task of providing information have imposedheavy burdens on the Management and their staff at a particularly difficulttime. We should like to record our appreciation of the courtesy with which wewere treated and the helpful manner in which our requests were handled.We have also had meetings with trade union representatives, including representatives of British Leyland shop stewards, both in London and at thevarious plants and a meeting with elected representatives of British Leylandmiddle management. The written submissions which they made to us and the talks we had with them were of great help to us in our work.Finally we should like to acknowledge the many written submissions we received from organisations and individuals and the willingness with which many of them gave up time to talk to us or our supporting staff about british leyland. To them and to all who have helped in the preparation of the report we express our thanks.We now submit our Report.Sir Don Ryder, ChairmanR A ClarkS J GillenF S McWhirterC H Urwin

BRITISH LEYLAND: THE NEXT DECADESummary1. We were appointed on 18th December 1974&apos;... to conduct, in consultationwith the Corporation and the trade unions, an overall assessment of BLMCspresent situation and future prospects, covering corporate strategy, investment,markets, organisation, employment, productivity, management/labour relations,profitability and finance; and to report to the Government&apos; [Hansard, col 1727).At the same time the Government obtained Parliaments approval to a guaranteeby the Government of lending by the banks to British Leyland (BL) of up to 50m. Chapter 1 of the Report outlines briefly the origin and nature of thefinancial crisis at BL which brought about the Government intervention. It also includes (paragraph 1.11) the confidential guidelines given to the Team toamplify the published terms of reference.Prospects for the industry. We decided that, in assessing BL&apos;s situation and prospects, it would be useless to take a short-term view. In the motor industry three or four years must elapse between the decision to introduce a new model or to undertake a majorplant modernisation and the completion of these projects. Once the new modelis introduced and the new plant is in full operation, many more years must elapse before resources can be available to replace the model or renew the plant.Therefore decisions made now about a capital expenditure programme extending over five to seven years must take into account market prospects ten years from now.3. Our starting point was therefore to examine world market prospects forthe motor industry generally over the period to 1985. It is unusually difficultto make such an assessment at present. The past eighteen months have seen a sharp rise in the price of oil relative to other goods, historically high rates of inflation throughout the world, and a cutback in economic growth and consumerdemand in the main industrial countries. As a result car sales which had grownrapidly over the two decades up to 1973 fell abruptly in all major markets in1974 and may be no higher and perhaps even somewhat lower this year. along with more long term anxieties about the environment and congestion, the recentdrop in demand has raised some doubts and uncertainties about future prospects for the motor industry.4. The conclusions we have reached are set out in Chapter 2. Broadly ourview is that while the world market for the motor industry over the next decadewill undoubtedly be less buoyant than in the recent past and will be morefiercely competitive, particularly in the early years when there is likely to beexcess capacity, it will remain a large and valuable market. Moreover, in some
areas of the world and for some types of vehicles considerable growth in salescan be expected.5. Nearly half the vehicles produced by BL are cars for the UK market. the uk market for cars depends mainly on trends in the economy, particularly inthe growth of consumers&apos; expenditure, and on action which Governments take to influence these trends. On reasonable assumptions about these matters(discussed in paragraphs 2.11 to 2.16) we think that the total UK car market should start to grow again in 1976, should by 1980 have recovered to the 1973peak of 1.6m vehicles and should between 1980 and 1985 grow further to at least.7m vehicles and possibly a higher level.6. The prospects in overseas markets for cars are discussed in paragraphs.17 to 2.20. In Western Europe (excluding the UK), which accounted for nearly 60 per cent (some 200,000) of BL&apos;s overseas car sales last year, we believethat total demand will start to recover next year, should reach around 9m carsin 1980 (13 per cent higher than in 1973) and at least 10m cars (26 per cent higher than in 1973) by 1985. In most other markets, including the USA,which last year accounted for about 15 per cent (some 52,000) of BL&apos;s overseascar sales, the pattern is expected to be more like that in the UK - a recovery to1973 levels by 1980 and little growth between 1980 and 1985.7. The prospects for vans both in the UK and Western Europe are broadly the same as those for cars (paragraphs 2.31 to 2.33).8. The UK market for heavy trucks is discussed in paragraphs 2.23 to 2.26.Partly as a result of the tendency to replace such vehicles more frequently becauseof more stringent vehicle legislation and the cost and scarcity of qualifiedmaintenance staff, total UK demand for heavy trucks seems likely to be about30 per cent higher than last year by 1980 and there should be some furthermodest growth between 1980 and 1985.9. The prospects in overseas markets for heavy trucks (paragraphs 2.27 to2.30) are good. This is particularly true of those countries which either produceoil (Iran and Nigeria) or have good access to favourably priced oil (Turkey)and are growing fast. In these three countries it seems likely that demand for heavy trucks will more than double by 1985. There is also a large market for heavy trucks in Western Europe which shows modest but significant growthprospects over the next few years and where BL has a major opportunity for increasing its penetration.10. For buses there are problems in forecasting demand both in the UK and overseas, since it turns on the placing of particular large contracts. In the uk BL is a dominant supplier of many types of bus (notably double deck buses)and operators seem likely to want to place large orders over the next few years which BL could not meet (paragraphs 2.34 to 2.37). We recommend in Chapter5 (paragraph 5.27) that the Department of the Environment should as a matterof urgency hold discussions with BL and the major UK bus operators to workout arrangements for better co-ordination between the bus operators and BLto phase orders and deliveries. As capacity becomes available, both to meet
home demand and to supply overseas markets on a more regular basis, BL willhave to make a more systematic attempt to forecast overseas demand for buses(paragraph 2.34).11. For agricultural tractors, which accounted for only 13,000 of BL&apos;s totalsales of over 1 million vehicles in 1973/74, demand at home and overseas willprobably continue to decline, although there will be growth in some countries where mechanisation of agriculture is likely to develop over the next few years.The right strategy for BL12. Against the background of this assessment of world market prospects we considered what strategy BL should follow over the next decade and our con-clusions are set out in Chapter 3. We examined the following issues:(i) Whether there is a future for BL as a vehicle producer.(ii) Whether BL should diversify into non-vehicle activities and divest itself of its existing peripheral activities.(iii) Whether BL should remain a producer of both cars and commercial vehicles.(iv) Whether BL should remain a producer of both volume and specialistcars.(v) In which geographical areas BL&apos;s marketing effort should be concentrat-ed:13. We concluded that there was undoubtedly a future for BL as a vehicleproducer. Although competitive pressures will increase over the next decade,there is no reason why BL should despair of improving its position in this very valuable market. Vehicle production does not involve the kind of advanced technology which can only be financed in very strong and highly developedeconomies such as the United States. On the other hand, although there is likelyto be an increasing trend towards local manufacture in the developing countries,there is enough scope for sophistication and refinement to give establishedproducers with skilled labour forces a competitive edge in the developed countries. In general, therefore, vehicle production is the kind of industry which ought to remain an essential part of the UK&apos;s economic base. We believe, therefore,that BL should remain a major vehicle producer, although this means that urgentaction must be taken to remedy the weaknesses which at present prevent it fromcompeting effectively in world markets.14. Since BL is already a very large company and needs to concentrate itsmanagerial skills and resources on improving its competitive position as a majorproducer of vehicles, we concluded that it would not be wise for BL to diversifyits activities into unrelated sectors of industry. We have, however, recommended neutral policy on the divestment of BL&apos;s existing peripheral activities theoperations grouped in BL&apos;s Special Products Division and Prestcold Ltd. Weprovide some factual information about these activities in Chapter 13, pointing out that there are major market opportunities and growth prospects for Prestcoldin particular which need to be vigorously pursued. We have therefore proposedthat, following the Report, there should be a detailed investigation of the futureof these companies.
15. We concluded that BL should remain a producer both of cars and of trucksand buses (paragraph 3.7) and also that BL should continue in both the &quot;volume&apos;and the &quot;specialist&apos; sectors of the car market. In particular we considered whetherBL should abandon the &apos;small/light&apos; sector of the market. In practice, this wouldmean that BL would not provide for any replacement for the Mini in its futureproduct plans. We concluded that there were strong arguments both on com-mercial grounds and on national economic grounds for BL to continue inthe small/light sector of the market (paragraph 3.8). In order to compete effect-ively in all the major sectors of the car market BL would have to cut out competi-tion between models in the same sector, and reduce the number of different body-shells, engines, transmissions etc. Similar rationalisation would be necessary intrucks and buses (paragraph 3.9). BL would also need to build on the reputationfor quality and distinction which it enjoys in the more expensive sectors of themarket. All its models, throughout the product range, should have sufficientdistinction to ensure a competitive edge against the very high volume producers(paragraph 3.10).16. On markets (paragraph 3.11) we concluded, following the analysis in chapter 2, that the main thrust of BL&apos;s marketing effort overseas should be toincrease its present small share of the expanding Western European market both for cars (under 3 per cent at present) and for trucks and buses (about 1 per cent at present). BL should also continue to take full advantage of the very rapidly growing market for trucks and buses in certain developing countries such asIran, Nigeria and Turkey.Financial position17. In Chapter 4 we set out our assessment of BL&apos;s financial capability forcarrying out this strategy. An examination of past trading results shows thatthroughout the period since BL was formed in 1968, profits were wholly inade-quate and insufficient to maintain the business on a viable basis (paragraphs 4.3 to4.6). To make matters worse nearly all the profit was distributed as dividendsinstead of being retained to finance new capital investment (paragraphs 4.7 and4.8). A substantial proportion of BL&apos;s fixed assets were old and had been fullywritten down. The depreciation charge was therefore an inadequate measure ofwhat should have been spent on capital replacement (paragraphs 4.9 to 4.11).Working capital was also run down to a critical level (paragraph 4.12).18. We concluded therefore that BL&apos;s present levels of capital expenditure and working capital were far too low. Even to maintain these levels in real terms would, because of inflation, require BL to earn at least  ,100m a year profit,(paragraph 4.13) and much larger sums would need to be earned to make up for the capital rundown in the past.19. [The forecast of BL&apos;s profits and cash position to end September 1975given here has been omitted for reasons of commercial security.]We concluded, therefore, that very large sums would be needed from externalsources to finance the action required to make BL a viable business.Product range and markets20. In considering what action would be required to make BL viable, we
looked first at BL&apos;s product range and market objectives. Our conclusions are set out in Chapter 5.21. On the product plan the time lag referred to.in paragraph 2 of thisSummary meant that we could not make any recommendations for introducingnew models before the end of 1978. [The summary of the Team&apos;s proposals for new models given here has been omitted for reasons of commercial security.]22. Our other recommendations, together with BL&apos;s existing product plan tothe end of 1978, are mainly directed to product rationalisation. [The summary ofthe Team&apos;s proposals for a reduction in the number of models, engines, trans-missions and axles given here has been omitted for reasons of commercialsecurity.]23. With this product plan we consider that BL should be able to retain inthe early nineteen-eighties its present share of the UK market for cars, trucksand buses. BL&apos;s base in the UK market is still one of its major strengths. Ascompetition from imports will increase substantially, maintaining this home market share will require a considerable and sustained marketing effort by BL(paragraph 5.31).24. We recommend, however, that BL should devote more effort than in thepast to developing overseas sales. In recent years BL has had a poor reputationin many overseas markets for not keeping delivery promises, for shortage of parts, and for inadequate after-sales service. We comment on the reasons andthe possible remedies in paragraph 5.32. Within overseas markets we recommendthat the main emphasis should be on Western Europe (in accordance with themarket assessment in Chapter 2 and the proposed strategy in chapter 3). in western Europe (excluding the UK) BL should aim to improve its share of thecar market from around 3 per cent to around 4 per cent and of the truck marketfrom around 1 per cent to around 5 per cent. BL should also take full advantageof the opportunities for truck sales in the richer developing countries such asIran, Nigeria and Turkey.Engineering25. We next examined BL&apos;s engineering resources and facilities to see whetherthey would be capable of carrying out this extensive programme of productdevelopment and rationalisation. Our conclusions and recommendations are set out in Chapter 6. We consider that the dispersed and fragmented organisationof BL product development engineering is a serious weakness. We proposethat the skills concerned with various aspects of product development - productplanning, styling engineering and vehicle engineering - should be brought within a single product development organisation for cars and that thereshould be a similar organisation for trucks and buses (paragraphs 6.2 to 6.5).BL also needs new central laboratories and workshops for the design anddevelopment of new cars and components. We recommend that these shouldbe built by 1979; as an interim measure, temporary facilities, probably atSolihull, should provide the centre of control for vehicle engineering personnel;the truck and bus facilities at Leyland should be extended as a matter of urgency(paragraphs 6.6 and 6.7). An early decision is needed on how test track facilitiescan best be provided for BL (paragraph 6.8).
Production26. We next examined the adequacy of BL&apos;s production facilities. A detailed study has been made which will be available in due course for BL&apos;s ongoingmanagement. Our main conclusions and recommendations are set out in chapter 8.27. For historical reasons BL has a large number of plants scattered through-out the country. Although some progress has been made since the mergertowards a more logical arrangement of manufacturing operations in the differentlocations, there is still too much movement of manufactured parts and sub-assemblies between plants. In body and assembly operations we recommendthat individual plants should be associated with one or more model lines fromthe receipt of pressed out panels to final assembly (paragraphs 8.5 and 8.6).Likewise, plants should specialise in the production of engines, gearboxes andchassis without distinction by model type and without being involved in bodyassembly operations (paragraph 8.7). Similar parts should be produced in thesame location (paragraph 8.8)&apos;. A senior executive should be appointed todevelop BL&apos;s parts manufacturing activities to improve costs and reduce thenumber of different parts (paragraph 8.9). Substantial economies could andshould be achieved quickly by a programme to improve the layout of processeswithin plants (paragraph 8.10).28. The most serious feature of BL&apos;s production facilities is, however, thata large proportion of the plant and machinery is old, outdated and inefficient(paragraph 8.11). [Information about the age of BL&apos;s plant and machinerygiven here has been omitted for reasons of commercial security.] BL&apos;s foundriesare in urgent need of modernisation to bring them up to modern efficiencylevels and safety and environmental standards. These serious deficiencies are theresult of the lack of provision for capital expenditure discussed in Chapter 4and referred to in paragraphs 17 and 18 of this Summary. A massive programme to modernise plant and equipment at BL must therefore be put in hand immediately(paragraphs 8.13 and 8.14) in conjunction with the new product plan.Organisation and management29. We then considered whether BL&apos;s existing organisation and managementwould be appropriate to carry out the strategy we had proposed and thenecessary programme of product rationalisation, reorganisation of productionand engineering facilities, and new capital investment. Our conclusions andrecommendations are set out in Chapter 12. We are convinced that BL&apos;spresentorganisational structure has harmful effects on the efficiency of BL&apos;s operations andis likely to impede its future development. It combines most of the disadvantages of both centralised and decentralised organisations with few of the advantages of either (paragraph 12.4). There has been inadequate integration of the productplanning, engineering, manufacturing and marketing of cars. The managing director has too many people reporting to him. The creation of a large corporatestaff has undermined the authority and responsibility of line management.30. Our approach has been to divide up BL&apos;s activities, within the overallcorporate structure, into four separate businesses British Leyland Cars, british leyland Trucks and Buses, British Leyland Special Products and British Leyland
International (Chart 12.3). Each would be a profit centre in its own right with itsown Managing Director. At corporate level there would be a non-executiveChairman and a Chief Executive and a corporate staff drastically reduced to the absolute minimum (paragraph 12.18).31. We considered and rejected the approach of dividing up BL&apos;s car opera-tions into two or three separate divisions based on products (Austin Morris,Rover Triumph and Jaguar). We believe that this would impede the policies ofproduct rationalisation and integration of design, engineering and productionrecommended in Chapters 5, 6 and 8 (paragraphs 12.11 to 12.13).32. We attach the greatest importance to the maximum delegation of authority and responsibility within the new structure from the Chief Executive to the fourManaging Directors and from them to the line management below them. Thiswould take place within a framework of corporate planning and control whichwe outline in paragraphs 12.14 to 12.17.33. Our proposals for the internal organisation of the four separate businessesare set out in paragraphs 12.21 to 12.23 and Charts 12.4 to 12.7. The mostimportant proposals are those relating to British Leyland Cars where we recom-mend four line divisions one dealing with product planning, development and engineering, one with manufacturing, one with sales and marketing, and one with parts and KD (&apos;knocked down&apos;) activities. This is a radical change fromBL&apos;s present organisation which consists of separate divisions for differentproducts dealing with their own engineering and marketing and, to some extent,manufacturing, co-ordinated by corporate staff.34. Associated with this new organisational structure and approach therewill have to be changes in BL&apos;s top management. Our proposals are in paragraphs12.24 and 12.25. In some cases we have been able to recommend particularindividuals; in other cases, for reasons which are explained, we have not beenable to do this but we have candidates in mind. The quality of BL&apos;s second rankmanagement is generally good, and: often very good.Industrial relations35. Throughout our inquiry we were aware that, although we had manyproposals to make BL more competitive fewer and better models, improvedfacilities for design, engineering and production and changes in organisationand management BL&apos;s success would depend most of all on the skills, efforts and attitudes of its 170,000 employees. We have therefore examined industrial relations at BL at some length in Chapter 9 of our Report. We do not subscribe to the view that all the ills of BL can be laid at the door of a strike-prone and work-shy labour force (paragraph 9.2). Nevertheless, it is clear that if BL is to compete effectively there must be a reduction in the man-hours lost throughindustrial disputes (paragraphs 9.3 and 9.4). More productive use must alsobe made both of BL&apos;s existing capital investment and the planned additional capital investment and this must mean more realistic manning levels and moremobility and interchangeability of labour (paragraphs 9.5 and 9.6).36. We found ample evidence that BL&apos;s employees at all levels want to make
their contribution to solving BL&apos;s problems (paragraph 9.8) and we must therefore find ways of sustaining and developing this constructive approach. Weconsider it essential (paragraph 9.9) that the progress of the capital expenditure programme and the injection of new finance by the Government should be stagedand that each stage should depend on evidence of a tangible contribution by BL&apos;work force and management to the reduction of industrial disputes and the im-provement of productivity. Careful forward manpower planning will be needed(paragraph 9.10), particularly in areas where major rationalisation of production facilities is undertaken.37. We considered measures to improve industrial relations at BL under three main headings payment systems, collective bargaining and industrial democracy.38. We concluded that there should be no major change in the system of payment by measured day work; there is, however, scope for improving thesystem and the possibility of introducing some incentive element in the futureshould be kept under review (paragraphs 9.12 to 9.15).39. We recommend that BL should continue to negotiate basic wages andconditions through the Engineering Employers&apos; Federation but should keep under review the balance of advantage of remaining within the Federation(paragraph 9.19). The basic agreements negotiated through the EEF are supple-mented by local bargaining at plant level. We consider that the multiplicity ofbargaining untis and renewal dates is an unsettling factor in BL&apos;s industrial relations. We therefore recommend that discussions should be held with thetrade unions about a gradual but substantial reduction in the number of collective bargaining units within BL and about a reduction in the renewal dates for wage settlements (paragraphs 9.20 to 9.22). BL line management in the newbargaining units should have sufficient delegated authority to negotiate effective-ly (paragraph 9.23).40. The most crucial factor in improving industrial relations at BL and in creating the conditions in which productivity can be increased is, however,that there should be some significant progress towards industrial democracy.Means must be found to take advantage of the ideas, enthusiasm and energyof BL&apos;s workers in planning the future of the business on which their livelihooddepends (paragraph 9.24). The contribution which we are seeking to the reductionof industrial disputes and the improvement of productivity can only be madein an atmosphere of joint problem-solving by management and unions. Thereshould be a framework, removed from the normal arrangements for collective bargaining, in which agreement can be reached on the action required (paragraph.32).41. We have therefore proposed a new structure of joint management/unioncouncils, committees and conferences, in which BL&apos;s shop stewards and par-ticularly their senior shop stewards will have a major role. The terms of reference of these bodies are in paragraphs 9.36 and 9.37. Trade union members will haveto recognise the new responsibilities which the shop stewards are exercising ontheir behalf and ensure that the right people are chosen to exercise these re-responsabilities. The first stage in implementing the proposals must be to explain
them fully and discuss them with BL&apos;s management and senior trade union representatives (paragraph 9.39).Procurement, distribution, controls and systems42. Our comments and recommendations about procurement, distribution and controls and systems are recorded briefly in Chapters 7, 10 and 11. Manyof the matters dealt with are related to our main proposals on organisation and management in Chapter 12 (see paragraphs 29 to 34 of this Summary).Cost of the programme43. We have therefore sought to devise a comprehensive and balanced pro-gramme to make BL a viable and fully competitive vehicle producer. In Chapter14 we have assessed the financial consequences of the programme up to theend of September 1982. In doing so we have thought it necessary to make someassumptions about future rates of inflation and these are explained in para-graph 14.3.44. Inevitably, because of the backlog of past massive under-investment, thecapital expenditure required is very large. In constant price terms it is  1,264mand in inflated price terms  2,090m over the eight years to end September 1982(paragraphs 14.4 to 14.8). There will also have to be an increased provision for working capital of around  260m in constant price terms or  750m in inflatedprice terms (paragraph 14.9). Although the cost of this programme is large weare convinced that this expenditure is necessary to make BL viable and fullycompetitive.45. A forecast has been prepared of the effect of this additional expenditurein improving BL&apos;s profits on certain assumptions including an importantassumption about the contribution from the work force in agreeing to manningreductions and greater mobility and interchangeability of labour. Our forecastis that BL&apos;s profits as a percentage of sales should improve to 11 per cent in1981/82 compared with an average of 6.5 per cent in the period 1968/69 to1973/74. BL&apos;s return on capital employed is also forecast to improve to 19.6per cent in 1981/82 compared with an average of 9.6 per cent in the period1968/69 to 1973/74 (paragraphs 14.10 to 14.13). While, we recognise that this isnot a satisfactory return, it must be appreciated that it is caused by the pastmassive under-investment. After 1982 BL should start to reap the benefits of thenew capital expenditure programme.46. We then analysed the effect on BL&apos;s cash flow. Although BL is forecast to achieve a positive cash flow in 1981/82 there is likely to be a requirement forfunds from external sources during the period 1974/75 to 1980/81 of  1,300m to 1,400m in inflated price terms. In the period to end September 1978 the require-ment is forecast to be  900m in inflated price terms.Financing of the programme47. In Chapter 15 we set out our proposals for financing the requirement of 900m in inflated price terms up to the end of September 1978. In our view avery large part of the funds can only be provided by the Government (para-graphs 15.2 to 15.4) and we argue (paragraph 15.5) that there is an overwhelming-
ly strong case for the Government to provide the funds because of BL&apos;s im-portance to the national economy. We recommend strongly against appointing a receiver for BL (paragraph 15.6).48. We therefore propose that the Government should be prepared toprovide  200m in equity capital now and up to  500m in long term loan capital in stages over the period 1976 to 1978 (paragraph 15.9). The equity capital shouldbe provided by the Government^ underwriting of a rights issue to existingshareholders, following a capital reconstruction through a Scheme of Arrange-ment. It is likely that relatively few shareholders will take up these rights and theGovernment will therefore be left with most of the shares. The rights issueshould be preceded by an offer by the Government to buy out existing share-holders at a price of lOp per share. [The Team&apos;s judgement about the percentageof the enlarged equity capital likely to be acquired by the Government has been omitted.] On the inflation assumptions explained in paragraph 14.3 of Chapter14 a further  500m is forecast to be required between end September 1978 andend September 1982. It is not possible to foresee the type of financing whichwill be appropriate for a period so far ahead but the Government must beprepared to make funds available either as loan capital or as a mixture of loanand equity capital (paragraph 15.22).49. We recommend that, following the initial injection of  200m of equity capital, there should be review points on each occasion when a further trancheof funds is provided to assess the contribution being made to the reduction ofindustrial disputes and the improvement in productivity (paragraph 15.23).Timing50. The timing of the programme outlined in our Report is crucial to BL&apos;ssurvival. [The Team&apos;s proposals about the timetable have been omitted].Presentation51. When the Government announces its intentions about BL, a major effort must be made to ensure that the proposals are fully understood by the em-ployees and that the employees recognise the implications for them. A seriesof meetings will have to be arranged throughout BL at which the new manage-ment of BL can explain what the capital expenditure programme means for thefuture of BL, that the injection of substantial funds from the Government will be dependant stage by stage on progress towards reducing industrial disputes and improving productivity, and that management and trade union representatives have been asked by the Government to set up a new structure of joint councils,committees and conferences to seek agreement on the action required.
Events leading to the inquiry1.1 The British Leyland Motor Corporation Ltd (BL) began a series of high-level discussions with the Department of Trade and Industry (later theDepartment of Industry) in the summer of 1973. At that time BL was drawing up a new capital investment programme for the following five to six years.The Government was concerned primarily about the extent to which, as partof this programme, new projects might be undertaken in the assisted areas,in return for selective financial assistance under Section 7 of the industry act 1972.1.2 From the autumn of 1973 onwards, a succession of events the oilcrisis, the three-day week, the deterioration in economic prospects in theUnited Kingdom and world markets, and the rapid increase in inflation caused BL to re-appraise radically both its capital investment programme andits financial position. Whereas BL&apos;s. budget in the autumn of 1973 had assumed a profit before tax of  68 million in 1973/74, a loss of  16 million was reported for the first half year to the end of March 1974.1.3 This turn-round in BL&apos;s profitability made it much more difficult forthe Corporation to assume that it could finance expansion from its own re-sources. At the same time the downward revision of market forecasts bothcast doubts on BL&apos;s capacity to earn adequate profits in the medium term and weakened the case for investment in additional capacity. The cost of theoriginal programme had in any case increased to over  900 million. BLtherefore concluded in the summer of 1974 that the original capital investment programme would have to be scaled. down to the minimum consistent withmaintaining a viable business and that, even at that level, it could not be financed from BL&apos;s own resources.1.4 In July 1974 BL therefore made a presentation to its principal bankers(the four clearing banks Barclays, Lloyds, Midland and National West-minster) to seek their support for a revised capital investment programme of 507 million spread over the six years 1972/73 to 1977/78. Of this total 142 million was due to have been spent by September 1974, leaving  365million for the four years from October 1974 to September 1978. BL had arrived at the new programme by cutting out most of the planned capacityincreases and by deferring or eliminating some model changes. Only 9 per cent of the expenditure was for the expansion of existing capacity and the remainderwas divided almost equally between expenditure on modernisation and expen-diture on tooling and facilities for new models. To finance this modifiedplan BL sought medium-term finance of  150 million, of which  50 million would reduce existing UK overdraft facilities.
1.5 At about the same time there were also discussions between BL andthe Department of Industry about the capital investment programme. TheDepartment was concerned about the wider and longer term economic con-sequences of a cut-back in BL&apos;s capital investment. BL therefore indicated the developments which could be financed if, in addition to the finance being sought from the banks,  100 million could be made available from externalsources.1.6 Meanwhile, BL was becoming aware that its cash position was deteriorating even more seriously than had been foreseen earlier in the year.The Board reviewed the position at the end of September. A cash conser-vation programme was instituted and approvals of capital expenditure wererestricted. The clearing banks also became seriously concerned about BL&apos;scash position and in November instructed Mr J .T H Macnair, a partner inthe firm of accountants Thomson McLintock &amp; Co, to examine the validity of the cash projections BL had made available to them the previous July.1.7 The seriousness of the situation was revealed when the unauditedresults for the year ending 30th September 1974 became available. Thesesuggested that, in the year to the end of September 1974, the corporation had made a net loss of  9.9 million to which should be added a loss on the closure of the Australian subsidiary of  11.8 million, a total loss of  21.7 million. (Actual published results in the Annual Report were a net grouploss of  8.3 million, a loss on the Australian subsidiary of  15.7 rniUion and total group losses of  23.95 million). Net liquid assets at the end of September1973 of  50.7 million had changed into net liabilities of  43.1 million (auditedfigures altered this to  35.2 million) and the Corporation^ overdraft (UKand overseas) stood at  148 million (offset by bank deposits of  105 million).1.8 These results were discussed at a meeting between BL, the banks andthe Department of Industry on 27th November 1974. It was revealed that theposition had worsened further since the end of September. BL was expectedto reach the limit of its existing UK overdraft facilities of  152 million during december and a further cash outflow of  30 million was expected during january. It became clear that, in these circumstances, the banks were most unlikely to grant BL further facilities.1.9 After a series of meetings involving Ministers, officials, BL and the banksthe Secretary of State for Industry announced on 6th December that:&apos; because of the company&apos;s position in the economy as a leading exporterand its importance to employment both directly and through the manyfirms that are dependent on it, the Government are informing the com-pany&apos;s bankers that the approval of Parliament will be sought for aguarantee of the working capital required over and above existing facilities.In response to the company&apos;s request for support for its investment programme, the Government also intend to introduce longer-termarrangements, including a measure of public ownership. In order tohelp the Government in framing a scheme for this purpose, they propose to appoint a high level team, led by Sir Don Ryder, including members drawn from the Industrial Development Advisory Board, toadvise on the company&apos;s situation and prospects, and the team will
consult with the company and the trade unions in the course of its work&apos;.(Hansard, 6th December 1974, col 2115).1.10 On 18th December the Secretary of State laid the resolution beforeParliament to enable the Government to guarantee a further  50 million lendingby the banks to the Corporation under Section 8 of the Industry Act 1972.In doing so he announced the names of the Team members, Messrs R A Clark,S Gillen, F S McWhirter and C H Urwin, and described its remit as:&apos; ... to conduct, in consultation with the Corporation and the tradeunions, an overall assessment of BLMCs present situation and future prospects, covering corporate strategy, investment, markets, organisation,employment, productivity, management/labour relations, profitability and finance; and to report to the Government&apos;.(Hansard, Wednesday 18th December, col 1727).1.11 In addition the following confidential guidelines were given to theTeam, in amplification of the terms of reference, to indicate the matters whichwould need to be covered in the Report:&apos; (/) an assessment of the current financial position of the Corporation,with particular reference to profitability, cash flow and financial structure;(ii)  an assessment of the recent performance of the Corporation and itsstrengths and weaknesses;(Hi)  a broad review of the future size and structure of the Corporation,mcluding its modernisation and development programme;(iv) an assessment of the financial needs of the Corporation over the longer term (at least 4 years) and the type of financing required;(v) advice as to any special considerations which should be taken intoaccount by the Government in determining the extent of public owner-ship, together with specific proposals on the terms for government finance;(vi) the financial objectives which the Corporation should seek to attainbearing in mind the Governments statement on the White Paper onthe Regeneration of British Industry that the National EnterpriseBoard will seek to secure an adequate return on that part of thenation&apos;s capital for which it is responsible and the consequences and cost of modifying these objectives to take account of other aspects ofthe national interest e.g. employment (national and regional) and balance of payments;(vii) the role of employees in the company&apos;s decision making&apos;.CHAPTER 2Prospects for the industry[This Chapter sets out BL&apos;s assessments of total demand for cars and other types of vehicle in the UK and major overseas markets in the period 1975-85, comments on these assessments and gives the Team&apos;s conclusions. the detailed material in this Chapter is omitted for reasons of commercial securitybut the Team&apos;s general conclusions are given in paras 2 to 11 of the summary.]
The right strategy for BL3.1 In the light of the assessment of future prospects for the motor industryset out in Chapter 2, the Team considered what strategy BL should followover the next decade.3.2 In doing so we had in mind the significance of BL to the UnitedKingdom economy. With a turnover of some  1,600 million in 1973/74, BLis one of the dozen or so largest companies in the private sector. Over theyears it has been our biggest single exporter and accounts for some 38 per cent of total exports of motor. vehicles and components. It has about 170,000employees in the UK and provides several hundred thousand more jobsindirectly in industries supplying components and materials, in motor vehicledistribution and in service trades in the areas where it is concentrated. In theWest Midlands BL accounts for over 10 per cent of male manufacturingemployment directly and a much larger proportion indirectly. BL also hasplants in the assisted areas, notably in Scotland, Wales and Merseyside.3.3 The main strategic issues are as follows:(/)  whether there is a future for BL as a vehicle producer;(ii)  whether BL should diversify into non-vehicle activities or divest itself of its existing peripheral activities;(Hi)  whether BL should remain a producer of both cars and commercial vehicles;(iv) whether BL should remain a producer of both volume and specialistcars;(v) in which geographical areas BL&apos;s marketing effort should be con-centrated.BL&apos;s future as a vehicle producer3.4 Some 94 per cent of BL&apos;s sales are of vehicles. The assessment ofprospects for the vehicle industry in Chapter 2 indicates that, despite therecent drop in sales and current uncertainties about oil prices and economicconditions generally, some market growth can be expected over the next decade. Although competitive pressures will increase over this period, thereis no reason why BL should despair of improving its position in this very valuable market. Vehicle production does not involve the kind of advanced technology which can only be financed in very strong and highly developedeconomies such as the United States. On the other hand, although there islikely to be an increasing trend towards local manufacture in the developing countries, there is enough scope for sophistication and refinement to giveestablished producers with skilled labour forces a competitive edge in the developed countries. In general, therefore, vehicle production is the kind ofindustry which ought to remain an essential part of the UK&apos;s economic base.If the UK were to opt out of vehicle production, it is not easy to see wherethe process of opting out would end. If BL were to cease production, therewould be a substantial loss of exports ( 485 million in 1973/74) and an even
more substantial increase in imports (BL had sales of  843 million in the UKmarket in 1973/74). We are convinced, therefore, that BL must remain a major vehicle producer. However, in our view this can only be achieved ifaction is taken now to remedy the weaknesses which at present prevent it from competing effectively in world markets. These matters are dealt with.in later Chapters of the Report.Diversification or divestment3.5 Since BL is already a very large company and should continue as a major vehicle producer, we do not believe that it should attempt to diversifyits activities into unrelated sectors of industry. The question of whetherparticular components could be more economically produced by BL itselfinstead of being bought in from outside suppliers should of course be kept under review. It could indeed be advantageous for BL eventually to take oversome minor producers of materials and components to improve security and quality of supply. But an extension of BL&apos;s interests outside the vehicle indus-try would only distract the management from the main task which faces theCorporation.3.6 We have considered whether early action should be taken to dispose of those existing activities of BL which do not fall within the main car andtruck and bus business. These are mainly in the Special Products Division andare discussed in detail in Chapter 13 of the Report. Some of these activitiesinvolve the production of specialist vehicles or mobile heavy equipment (egCoventry Climax, Alvis, Aveling Barford) which have some link with themain vehicle business. Others (eg the foundries) are concerned in varying degrees with supplies to the main vehicle business. Others again (eg Prestcold)have no natural link with BL&apos;s main activities. We believe that the rightstrategy for BL on the possible divestment of these activities should, at thisstage, be a neutral one. Following the Report, we recommend a detailed investigation of the future of these companies. The companies are describedmore fully in Chapter 13 of the Report.Cars and commercial vehicles3.7 In 1973/74 BL sold 853,000 cars and 167,000 commercial vehicles(mainly trucks and buses). We believe that BL should continue as a producer in both these sectors. As Chapter 2 showed there are considerable prospects for growth in the overseas market for heavy trucks. Moreover, if there is any possibility in the longer term that car demand will be restricted because of urban congestion, pollution and other environmental factors, energy con-servation or economic developments which cannot at present be foreseen, thesame factors are unlikely to apply in the same way or in the same degree to the demand for trucks and buses. Measures to restrict car usage may, forexample, lead to an increase in demand for buses. The right strategy forBL is therefore to continue as a producer of both cars and commercial vehicles.Volume cars and specialist cars3.8 Having accepted that BL should remain a major producer of cars,we considered whether it should continue as at present to cover the full range of the market from the &apos; small/light&apos; sector (represented by the Mini) tothe luxury sector (represented by the laguar). In the past the more expensive
models produced by BL (not only Jaguars, but also Rovers and Triumphs)have proved more profitable, and a less satisfactory return has been earnedon volume cars, particularly the Mini. We therefore examined whether BLshould adopt a strategy of abandoning the bottom end of the volume carmarket. This would mean in effect that no replacement would be brought forward for the Mini. We are strongly of the view that this would be the wrong strategy. The fact that BL is represented in all the major sectors ofthe car market is a potential strength. This is particularly true at a timewhen there is a good deal of uncertainty about future trends in car demand.It is possible that pressure for energy conservation will shift demand infavour of the smaller cars. This may in turn make the small car businessrelatively more profitable than in the past. Moreover, producers with modelsat the small end of the market have a better chance of securing customerswho are buying a car for the first time and may retain these customers, as their income increases, in the higher sectors of the market. There are also important considerations affecting the national economy. In 1974 16 per cent of total UK sales were in the* small and light sectors of the car market, inwhich the Mini competes. The Mini accounted for nearly half of these sales.If BL were to opt out of this sector of the market, there would undoubtedly be a very substantial increase in car imports. The Mini makes up a substantial proportion of BL&apos;s exports, particularly in Europe. In 1973/74, nearly two-thirds of the cars sold by BL in Western European export markets were Minis.It ought therefore to be both in BL&apos;s interest and in the national interestto remain in the small/light sectors of the car market as well as the medium,large, luxury and sports car sectors.3.9 While it is to BL&apos;s advantage to be represented in all the major sectors of the car market, BL has suffered from having an unusually large number ofdifferent models and power transmission units. At present BL has nine differentsaloon car body shells and twelve basic car engine types. If BL is to competeeffectively there must be a substantial programme of product rationalisation,competition between different BL models in the same sector must disappearand there must be a much greater common use of components, suspensions andstructures. There is a similar need for rationalisation in truck and bus pro-duction.3.10 It has been argued that BL will be unable to compete effectively in the production of volume cars because it cannot match the very highvolumes of the major European and Japanese producers, notably Volkswagen,Toyota, Nissan, Fiat and Renault. We do not accept this. But BL&apos;s strategymust be to build on the reputation for quality which it enjoys in the more expensive sectors of the market. All its models, throughout the product range,should have sufficient distinction to ensure a competitive edge.Markets3.11 The assessment of prospects for the industry in Chapter 2 indicated that, while little growth is expected in the UK market and also (although this may be pessimistic) in the US market, substantial growth in demand is expected in Western Europe. At present, however, BL&apos;s market share in western europe is less than 3 per cent. We believe that BL must aim, over the next10 years, to secure a higher share of this expanding market. BL also has
only a small share of the Western European market for trucks and buses(about 1 per cent). Although truck and bus demand is likely to grow more rapidly in the developing countries and BL should therefore maintain itseffort in these markets (particularly in countries such as Iran, Nigeria and turkey), there is nevertheless scope for a major development of BL truck andbus sales in Western Europe.Summary3.12 Our recommendations about BL&apos;s strategy over the next decade aretherefore as follows:(0 BL should continue to be predominantly a vehicle producer andshould not diversify its activities into other sectors of industry;(ii) BL should at this stage adopt a neutral policy towards the divestmentof its existing peripheral activities, and following this Report thereshould be a detailed investigation of the future of these companies;(iii) BL should remain a producer both of cars and of trucks and buses.(jv) BL should continue to produce both volume and specialist cars andshould compete in all the major sectors of the car market ranging from the small/light sector to the luxury sector;(v) there should, however, be a substantial programme of productrationalisation;(vi) In order to compete effectively with the larger volume producers, BLmust build on the reputation for quality and distinction which itenjoys in the more expensive sectors of the market. All its models,throughout the product range, should have sufficient distinction toensure a competitive edge;(v/F) the main thrust of the marketing effort outside the UK over thenext decade must be to secure a larger share of the Western european market, both for cars and for trucks and buses.
Financial position4.1. The purpose of Chapters 4 to 13 of this Report is to assess BL&apos;present capability for carrying out the strategy outlined in Chapter 3, to identify the weaknesses, and to recommend action to remedy these weaknesses.4.2. Chapter 4 is concerned with BL&apos;s financial position. This isexamined under the following main headings:(i) BL&apos;s trading results since it was formed in 1968;(ii) the provision made over this period for investment in fixed capital and for the necessary increases in working capital;(iii) the latest profit forecast for the period to end September 1975;(iv) the latest forecast of the cash position to end September 1975.Trading results 1968/744.3. A summary of the trading results of BL since its formation is asfollows:Table 4.1BL trading resultsYears ended 30th September	1968	1969	1970	1971	1972	1973	1974Vehicle sold (&apos;000)	1,050	1,083	984	1,057	1,127	1,161	1,020	 m	 m	 m	 m	 m	 m	 mSales	974	970	1,021	1,177	1,281	1,564	1,595Trading profit	45	46	14	46	41	58	19Interest	7	5	10	14	9	7	17Profit before tax	38	41	4	32	32	51	2As percentage of sales	3.9%	4.2%	0.4%	2.7%	2.5%	3.3%	0.1%Note: The above profits are	after charging:						Depreciation:							Properties	3	3	3	3	3	3	plant	24	24	24	25	24	26	27	27	27	27	28	27	29	31Tooling amortisation	14	14	15	19	16	15	11	41	41	42	47	43	44	42The results for the year ended 30th September 1968 (except for vehicles sold) includefourteen months trading of British Motor Holdings Limited.4.4. The annual output, in terms of vehicles sold, has not varied signi-ficantly since the formation of the Group, the highest and lowest years beingwithin 9 per cent of the average annual sales volume for the entire period.The limiting factor throughout the period has been production capability, with
the two worst years, 1970 and 1974, having suffered from heavy productionlosses.4.5. The trend of trading profits before interest broadly reflects the trend of volumes produced, with particularly poor results in 1970 and 1974.The 1974 results were also affected by restrictions on passing on cost increases under the counter-inflation legislation and as a result of competitive pressuresin export markets.4.6. The main point which emerges from Table 4.1 is that the profitbefore tax, throughout the period, has been inadequate. As a percentage of sales it has never been higher than 4.2 per cent (1969) and the overall ratefor the whole period was only 2.3 per cent.4.7. Despite this low level of profits BL has over the period distributednearly all of them as dividends. In our view this policy was clearly wrong.The split between dividends and retentions is shown in the following table:Table 4.2Deductions and appropriations from profitsYears ended 30th September	1968	1969	1970	1971	1972	1973	1974	Total	 tn	 m	 m	 m	 m	 m	 m	 mProfit before tax	38	41	4	32	32	51	2	200Tax deferred	_	 .	_	_	4	12	15	31Tax payable	18	20	2	14	.;,,7 -	11	(6)	66Total tax	18	20	2	14	11	23	9	97Profit after tax	20	21	2	18	21	28	(7)	103Minority interest	(1)	(1)	(2)	(1)	2	(1)	(1)	(5)Extraordinary items	 	(2)	(6)	(1)	1	-1 :	(16)	(24)Profit/(loss) after all items	19	18	(6)	16	24	27	(24)	74Dividends	15	15	5	11	12	9	3	70Retentions	4	3	(ID	5	12	18	(27)	44.8. Over the whole period the net profits after charges including extra-ordinary items amounted to  74m, of which  70m has been paid out by wayof dividend. There should however have been substantial retentions to finance the increased cost of replacing fixed assets and additional working capital.Even if all the profits of  74m had been retained, together with the  49m ofnew funds raised by a rights issue in 1972, this would have been inadequate to meet BL&apos;s capital needs.Capital expenditure4.9. Apart from retained profits and new capital, the major source of funds to finance capital investment is the charge made by a company against it profits for the depreciation of existing assets. Although BL&apos;s accountingpolicies have been conservative, the charge for depreciation in the accounts,as a measure of the annual investment required, has been inadequate. Thisis partly due to the fact that a high proportion of the plant, throughout the
period 1968 to 1974 had already been fully depreciated. Depreciation of factory plant is provided on a straight line basis over periods ranging fromeight to ten years. Amortisation of special tools, dies and jigs is on a straightline basis over three years or less in certain circumstances, and revenue expenditure on research and development is written off as incurred. The extentto which the fixed assets in use by BL have already been fully depreciated in earlier years is shown in the following table:Table 4.3Age analysis of plant in use by BL at 30th September 1974Year of		Accumulated	Net BookAcquisition	Cost	Depreciation	value to 30th September	 m	 m	 m1974	53	3	501973	49	15	341972	20	7	131971	28	13	151970	21	14	7	-171	52	1191969	20	15	51968	28	23	51967	21	19	21962-1966	78	78	 1957-1961	112	112	 1952-1956	17	17	 Pre 1952	2	2	 	449	318	131In fact the table understates the proportion of old plant since in today&apos;sprices the cost of the plant acquired many years ago would be much higher.4.10. Table 4.3 therefore shows not only that BL is still using anunacceptably high proportion of old plant but also, since this old plant was fully written off some years ago, that the provision made for replacementover the period since 1968 has been lower than it should have been. The onlyreason why BL has been able to record the slender profits set out in Table4.1 is that these were arrived at without setting aside funds for replacinga substantial part of BL&apos;s plant.4.11. As a result of these factors BL&apos;s actual capital expenditure overthe period since 1968 has been modest as is shown in the table below:Table 4.4BL&apos;s capital expenditure 1968-74Year to 30th	Plant	Properties	TotalSeptember	 m	 m	 m1968	27	4	311969	23	6	291970	34	6	401971	25	4	291972	20	2	221973	30	6	361974	53	24	77Net operating assets4.12. There has also been a rundown to a critical level in BL&apos;s net
operating assets ie the working capital needed to finance stocks and day to day trading since 1971. This is shown in the following table:Table 4.5BL&apos;s net operating assetsAs at 30th September1968    1969    1970    1971    1972    1973    1974 m       m       m       m       m -     m       mSales for the year 974     970   1,021    1,177   1,281    1,564   1,595Net operating assets 98      125      176     221      150      122      139Percentage of sales 10.0%  12.9%   17.2% 18.8%  11.7%    7.8%   8.7%Effects of inflation4.13. It is clear therefore that, even in a non-inflationary economy, BLwould by 1974 have been in an extremely vulnerable position. For several years it had been spending far too little on replacing its fixed capital and hadbeen running down its working capital. Inflation means however that even to maintain the expenditure on plant replacement and to finance working capital at the same level in real terms, much higher levels of profit arerequired. It has been calculated that, at current rates of inflation, BL would need to earn  100m more profit a year than it does at present merely to finance inflationary increases in fixed and working capital, ie to stand still.This ignores any provision to make up for past under-investment, and makes no allowance for dividends.[Paragraphs 4.14 to 4.27 analyse BL&apos;s profit and cash forecast andborrowing position up to the end of September 1975.]4.28. Very large sums will therefore need to be provided from external isources to finance the new capital investment and other action required tomake BL a viable business. The action required is described in the followingchapters under various detailed headings. The cost of the action required isanalysed in Chapter 14 and the financing of the additional expenditure is dealt with in Chapter 15.

The amount paid on the partly paid shares at 30th September1974 totalled  171,992 (5 per cent of the subscription price), the balance of thesubscription price being  3,267,827; in certain circumstances, relating totermination of employment, the Board is empowered to restrict thesubscription price to the par value of the shares (which would total  2,417,161).The subscription prices of these partly paid shares which were issued at various times between August 1970 and July 1972 varied between 30p and 51p,the price for the bulk of them being between 30p and 40p.4.1.4. The total issued and fully paid share capital of 593m ordinary shares of 25p each was issued as to 537m at the time of formation of BL (in exhange for shares in the two constituent companies), 54m by way of a rightsissue in 1972, and the balance of 2m on conversion of Loan Stock (referred tobelow) and full payment of Incentive Scheme shares.Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock4.1.5. On 24th February 1972 a rights issue of 1\ per cent ConvertibleUnsecured Loan Stock (&apos;the Loan Stock&apos;) repayable at par in 1982-87 wasmade. The Loan Stock carries the right, exercisable on 31st March each year,to convert into ordinary shares at the rate of 25p nominal of ordinary share capital for every 55p nominal of Loan Stock. The total balance of the LoanStock outstanding at 30th September 1974 was  26,766,669 (which, if fullyconverted, would represent 48,666,670 shares). In addition, under the terms ofthe share incentive scheme, there is a balance of  156,149 outstanding on partof the Loan Stock which had been subscribed by members of the share
incentive scheme and on which only 5 per cent had been paid at 30thSeptember 1974. The market price of the Loan Stock at mid-March was 41p(ex dividend) and the market value of the Loan Stock as a whole was some 11m.Other borrowings4.1.6. In addition to the Loan Stock, at 30th September 1974 the followingloans were outstanding, all of which with minor exceptions are repayable atpar: 000         000Secured:6$% Debenture Stock of LeylandSouth African Limited 1971-81 8571% Debenture Stock of Aveling-BarfordLimited 1986-91 8797i% Debenture of Ashok Leyland Limited 1979-83 - 1,066Other loans redeemable after more than 5 years 1,0133,043Unsecured:BL:6% Unsecured Loan Stock 1998-2003 12,4366.1% Unsecured Loan Stock 1977-82 3,37674% Unsecured Loan Stock 1987-92 9,9338% Unsecured Loan Stock 1998-2003 10,8695i% Unsecured Loan of 60 million Swiss Francs 1979-84(repayable in instalments from 1979) 8,6967i% Department of Trade andTndustry Loanredeemable in 1982 10,00071% 100 million French Francs Bonds 1977-87(repayable in instalments from 1977) 9,058Leyland Innocenti S.p.a.:9i% 9,000 million Italian Lire Loan 1976-84(repayable in instalments from 1976) 5,837   70,20573,248Borrowing powers4.1.7. The borrowing powers under the Articles of Association arerestricted to one and one half times the aggregate of BL&apos;s issued share capital and the reserves of the Group. Based on the balance sheet at 30th September1974 this limit is  390.3m.4.1.8. The borrowing limits imposed by the Loan Stock and other loanTrust Deeds are:(a) The total amount outstanding of monies borrowed by BL and specifiedUK subsidiaries may not exceed one and one half times the aggregate of the share capital of BL and the reserves, as defined, of the UKGroup, less the book value of investments in overseas subsidiaries.Based on the balance sheet at 30th September 1974, this limit is 305m.(b) The total aggregate amount outstanding of all secured borrowing ofBL and all borrowings of UK subsidiaries other than BLUK may notexceed 30 per cent of the limit at (a) above. Based on the balance sheetat 30th September 1974, this limit is  91.5m.There are also restrictions on the disposal of the whole, or substantial parts of,the UK business.

Product range and markets[In Chapter 5 of the Report the Team make detailed recommendations about BL&apos;s future product and marketing policies. For reasons of commercialsecurity, these have not been published, but they are dealt with in general terms in paragraphs 20 to 24 of the Summary.]CHAPTER 6Engineering6.1. An important factor in the success of the policy of product andcomponent rationalisation that we recommend in the previous Chapter willbe the organisation of the engineering resources available to the corporation and the facilities in which to design and test the new products. The Teamconsider that the car and commercial vehicle operations should each have asingle and clear cut line of management responsibility for product development and product development engineers in one location with adequate supportingfacilities.Organisation6.2. Within a corporation manufacturing cars or commercial vehiclesthere is a variety of engineering talents. Some of these are concerned withthe development of new products, others are more closely associated with themanufacture of the current models. The first group includes the following:product planners who plan the outline of a model for a particular place inthe market; styling engineers who design the model to conform to parametersset by the product planners relating to certain basic size characteristics ofthe model, and vehicle engineers who translate the ideas of product plannersand styling engineers into requirements for production. The second group of engineering skills relates to production. They include the task of ensuring that the model prototypes can be manufactured in volume on a productionline up to an acceptable standard, and the responsibility for plant and machinelayout and performance.6.3. At present in BL the engineers involved in product development aredispersed among the different product divisions. We recommend that all thesetalents should be the responsibility of a single product development organisa-tion within the car operation, and there should be a similar arrangement for
trucks and buses, which would have unified management responsibility for allthe skills necessary for designing and developing new cars (or commercial vehicles). The central engineering capability would pool all the scarce design and planning resources in order to provide the designs for the rationalisedmodels that we recommend in Chapter 5. We believe that the creation of thissingle product planning group is an urgent preliminary step in reorganisingBL&apos;s management structure. We have detailed proposals for the organisationof this group which will be made available to the new management.6.4. We recommend that the engineering skills which relate to the manufacturing process should continue to be designated as line responsibilitiesunder the manufacturing management.6.5. The central engineering capability will perform one other importantfunction. The most striking example of the fragmented engineering approachin the Corporation at present is the quantity of part numbers. We were told that BL has 4 to 5 times the quantity that Ford (UK) has. This increaseshandling costs, slows production processes and magnifies scheduling andpurchasing problems. The reason is that engineering staffs, who create thespecifications for parts, are not in a single organisation with the maximumdegree of co-ordination. The numbers they give to release documents, whichbecome the parts&apos; numbers, are not on a common system. Engineering effort is at present being wasted on trying to achieve standardisation. In our view this can only be achieved satisfactorily through a central engineering organisa-tion. The organisation should also be able to achieve cost reductions through a corporate, unified approach to: materials specifications; package standards;drawing office standards, and test procedures. In addition it should assist indefining responsibility and creating methods for design cost control andproduct modifications.Facilities6.6. An important aspect of the design and development process is the ability to test components and complete models in the laboratory and inall driving conditions. At present BL has office, workshop and laboratoryspace for their car divisions at scattered points at 5 different sites. They haveno test track, using the facilities at the Motor Industry Research Association(MIRA) establishment at Nuneaton, and a few other scattered locations. TheTruck and Bus Division has workshop and laboratory facilities and a testtrack at Leyland.6.7. We recommend that BL should plan for a central complex oflaboratories and workshops to be built by 1979 for its car operations. As an interim measure temporary facilities, probably at Solihull, should provide thecentre of control for all car engineering personnel. The Truck and Busfacilities at Leyland should be extended as a matter of urgency.6.8. The Team have not been able to examine all the implications of theproposal to acquire a test track for BL. A track is urgently needed. [various possibilities are discussed; these are omitted for reasons of commercialsecurity.] We recommend that the new BL management should take an early decision on this.
Procurement[This Chapter discusses BL&apos;s purchasing arrangements and relation-ships with its suppliers and is omitted for reasons of commercial security.]CHAPTER 8Production8.1. In order to become an efficient, profitable producer of cars and commercial vehicles BL must remedy the shortcomings in its manufactur-ing facilities and techniques. The two main aspects on which urgent action is required are:(i) The need to reorganise production facilities to provide for special-isation in particular manufacturing activities.(ii) The replacement of outdated and inefficient plant and machinery.Plant location and activities8.2. There are 55 main manufacturing plants in BL, the breakdownat present is as follows:29 involved in car production13 in the Truck and Bus Division11 in the Special Products Division2 in PrestcoldThis Chapter is concerned mainly with the car and truck and busoperations and those foundries which are at present under the SpecialProducts Division.8.3. The main concentration for car operations is in the Midlandsaround Birmingham, Coventry, Solihull, Oxford and Swindon. Truck andbus operations reflect the locations of the original companies which, at onetime or another, have been merged into BL and are scattered throughoutthe country from Scotland (Glasgow and West Lothian) through Leylandto Bristol, Lowestoft, Southall and Park Royal. The companies under theSpecial Products Division are at Grantham, Leicester, Nottingham,Coventry, Tipton (Staffs) and Birmingham. In addition, the foundry opera-tions are at Tipton, Leeds, Keighley, Wellingborough (Northants), Long-bridge, Coventry and Farington in the Leyland complex.
8.4. In examining the operations in which each plant is involved, itis useful to separate the different functional processes associated with carmanufacture. They are:(a) Body and assembly operations: from stamping panels through theassembly of the body (body in white), painting, trim and finalassembly of the complete- car.(b) Power train and chassis operations: the foundry work on producingcastings for engines and cylinders; the manufacture of engines,suspensions (axles and chassis) and transmissions.(c) Parts: the supply of sub-assemblies and components electricals,brakes, radiators etc.The functional categorisation of truck and bus operations is similarexcept that in the case of buses, there is a sharper distinction between themanufacture of main components engines, axles and transmissions andthe final assembly which is mainly in the hands of specialist coach builders.Body and assembly operations8.5. The major inherited problem, created by the dispersed nature ofthese locations, is the difficulty of controlling and supervising the move-ment of manufactured parts and sub-assemblies between plants. this movement is apparent in the Truck and Bus Division where there is acomplicated routeing cross-pattern as panels and major assemblies move from one plant to another. For example, the plant at Bristol, besidesproducing single and double-deck bus chassis, takes axles from Bathgateand engines from Leyland and supplies chassis to coachbuilders in Leedsand Lowestoft. Some movement of parts and material between plants isessential. For human and financial considerations, BL clearly cannot startafresh and plan new plant layouts on &quot;green field&apos; sites with all assembly and finishing operations in one place. BL has to live with its existing plantsand it has made considerable progress towards the rationalisation of move-ment between them. There is still, however, some unnecessary movement,particularly in the car divisions, which transport unpainted body shells toanother location for paint, trim and final assembly.8.6. We recommend that the Corporation should expedite the rationalisation -sation of its assembly operations. The aim should be to bring together bodyassembly processes so that individual plants are associated with one or moremodel lines from receipt of the pressed out panels to final assembly. Thiswill avoid the wasteful transport of unpainted bodies from one location toanother.Engines, suspensions and transmissions8.7. The major programme of product rationalisation called for in chapter 5 requires that activities associated with the manufacture of majorcomponents should be brought together. Plants should specialise in engines,gear-boxes, and chassis without distinction by model type and without beinginvolved in the body assembly operations. The families of engines and gear-boxes should be fewer, be common to different model types and have similarcharacteristics throughout the range.
Parts manufacture8.8. There is a considerable degree of vertical integration in BL inthat the Corporation owns its own foundries and companies specialising in parts and sub-assemblies. The car divisions are responsible for five plantsinvolved in the manufacture of carburettors, radiators and other com-components. The Truck and Bus Division has similar interests in BUTEC.Although wholly owned by BL, these plants sell components to other motormanufacturers, but in many instances supply only part of BL&apos;s require-ments. They cannot rely on a steady run of production orders from BL tomaintain their profitability. Similar type parts are also produced in variouslocations so that the expertise that goes with their manufacture is dispersedthroughout the Corporation. We recommend that the Corporation ration-alise its present system of parts manufacture so that similar parts areproduced in the same location.8.9. We also recommend the appointment of a senior executiveresponsible for parts manufacture. He should achieve the following objec-tives: a better degree of self-reliance in the Corporation on its own partsproduction; an improvement in the flow of parts supplied into the powertrain and body assembly operations; and a major reduction in the quantityof part numbers by a deliberate programme of commonisation.Plant layout8.10. Besides the rationalisation of activities between plants, we recom-mend that BL should improve the layout of processes within plants. Manylayouts are not efficient; the piecemeal expansion of facilities over theyears has compromised original plans and added appreciably to the costs of handling materials. We consider that substantial economies could beachieved almost immediately by an early plant layout improvement pro-gramme. We have specific proposals which can be made available to thenew management.Investment in plant and machinery8.11. The serious under-provision for depreciation we have observed in Chapter 4 has been brought out dramatically in the evidence we have heard and seen about the under-capitalisation of BL&apos;s production facilities.In the automotive industry, most machinery is replaced after 8-12 years.In BL more than half the machines and equipment are over 15 years old.Apart from the need to introduce new models, BL would in any eventneed a heavy programme of investment to bring its machines and equip-ment up to modern working standards. [Detailed information in this para-graph and in an Annex about the age of BL&apos;s plant and machinery isomitted for reasons of commercial security.] This record of under-invest-ment is the main reason for the low productivity of BL&apos;s work force corn-pared with say Fiat or Volkswagen. It also engenders low morale amongthe work force and worsens industrial relations.8.12. The main area in which capital under-provision is most in evidence is in the foundries. BL owns 7 foundries which make about 54 per cent of the
Corporation&apos;^ requirement for grey iron and 20 per cent of its requirement for aluminium. The productivity levels are judged to be less than half those inplants which use more modern equipment. The Team are convinced that asubstantial programme of investment is needed for BL foundries not least tobring them up to the safety and environmental standards now required. This isnot, however, a problem confined to. the Corporation. It is a national issue which concerns the United Kingdom&apos;s industrial base. We therefore recom-mend that, once the broad outlines of BL&apos;s future are decided, discussions should be held with representatives of the foundry industry, both inside and outside BL, to plan a strategy of development and investment for the future.In the meantime, however, British Leyland should begin a programme for theimprovement of their foundries at an estimated cost, in today&apos;s prices, of 50 million.8.13 The programme of modernisation of facilities that BL must under-take can, in most areas, be associated with model changes. When tooling upfor a new product, the opportunity should be taken to improve facilities. Thisis not a policy which BL have followed in the past. There have been occasions when facilities for a new product have been &apos;tacked on&apos; to the plant producingthe existing product. This attitude must change. BL must adopt a co-ordinatedand comprehensive approach to its product rationalisation programme whichwould include an element for the automation of existing work processes. Webelieve that this, together with a programme of improved plant layout andthe implementation of the Team&apos;s other recommendations, will bring pro-duction efficiency up to the level of the Corporation^ competitors. We do not,however, recommend that BL should build any major new plant on a greenfield site in a new location. There will be exceptions to this in the case offoundries and possibly certain component manufacturing operations.Summary8.14. Our recommendations on BL&apos;s production facilities are as follows:(i) BL should reorganise its car manufacturing operations to providefor specialisation in body assembly work, power train and trans-mission or parts manufacture.(ii) The existing plants in the body assembly group should be engagedin all operations from receipt of stamped panels to final assembly of complete vehicles.(iii) Plants in the power train and transmission group should specialiseon a functional basis and not be involved in body assembly work.(iv) The truck and bus operations should be similarly organised so that,as far as is practicable, different plants specialise in particularactivities.(v) BL should rationalise its system of parts manufacture so that similar parts are produced in the same location.(vi) Among the organisational changes necessary, BL should appoint a senior executive with responsibility for all parts manufacture.(vii) BL should undertake an urgent programme to improve plant layout.
(viii) BL&apos;s expenditure on equipment to improve working practices andautomate manufacturing processes should, in most areas, be associated with model changes.(ix) Except for foundries and possibly certain component manufacture,there seems no need for BL to build any major new plant on agreen field site in a new location.(x) The future of BL&apos;s foundries will need to be considered in a widernational context. In the meantime, however, BL should plan for theimprovement of its own foundries.CHAPTER 9Industrial relations9.1. Other chapters of this Report discuss a whole range of proposalswhich we believe will help to make BL more efficient and competitive fewerand better models, improved facilities for design, engineering and production,and changes in organisation and management. These proposals cannot be implemented without the investment of very large sums of public money. But,even with these new plans and new resources, the success of BL over the next decade will depend mainly on the skills, efforts and attitudes of its 170,000employees. ,9.2. BL has suffered a good deal in recent years from adverse publicityabout its work force. Its strike record is continually discussed in the Press andthere have been stories about serious over-manning in particular plants. these reports are particularly damaging to BL&apos;s reputation in overseas markets. Wedo not subscribe to the view that all the ills of BL can be laid at the door of astrike-prone and work-shy labour force. While BL has suffered seriously frominterruptions to production, these have often been the result of factors outsidethe control of BL&apos;s work force breakdowns in plant and equipment, faultyscheduling, shortages of materials and components, and external industrial disputes. Moreover, some BL plants, for example, in South Wales, have an excellent industrial relations record. Similarly, one of the main reasons whyBL&apos;s workers produce less than workers at Fiat or Volkswagen is that so much less has been spent by BL on new plant and equipment. Nevertheless, when these necessary allowances and qualifications have been made, there remaintwo problems which must be dealt with in any programme for BL&apos;s futureover the next decade:(i) The interruptions to production resulting from industrial disputeswithin BL must be reduced.(ii) More effective use must be made both of BL&apos;s existing capital invest-ment and of the planned additional capital investment.The scale of these problems is set out in the following paragraphs.
Strikes: Scale of the problem9.3. BL has estimated that in 1973/74 it lost a total of 23.8 millionman-hours through industrial action, of which some 9.6 million man-hourswere attributable to disputes within BL. A comparison with figures for earlier years is given in the following table:Table 9.1Man-hours lost by industrial disputes at BLFinancial years to end September      External Internal Total9.4. It has been pointed out that the man-hours lost in 1973/74 represent only 3 per cent of the total of some 300 million man-hours a year availableto the company from its manual workers. In fact, however, the effect is muchmore severe than these figures would indicate. This is partly because theprofitability of vehicle production is very sensitive to degrees of utilisation of capacity. Moreover, much depends on the timing of industrial disputes. Theycan have particularly damaging effects when total market demand is high, as for example in 1973. BL&apos;s inability to supply as a result of industrial disputeswas a contributing factor to financial difficulties in the latter part of 1974.BL estimated that it lost 37 per cent of scheduled production during october and November 1974. About half of this was due to quality faults, facilityfailures, programme changes and absenteeism. But the remaining loss (19per cent of scheduled production) was due to industrial disputes and most ofthis (15 per cent of scheduled production) was due to disputes within BL.The timing of particular strikes can also critically affect model launches andthe winning of contracts. For example, in the early months of this year,despite the efforts of the unions involved, the engine tuners&apos; strike at Cowleydelayed the launch of the new ADO 71 model from the beginning to the endof March and the strike at Castle Bromwich resulted in the loss of a SouthKorean contract. It must be recognised that BL&apos;s experience is not uniquein the British motor industry. Indeed, in the first nine months of 1974 BL&apos;srecord was rather better than that of Ford or Chrysler (48 hours per employeelost compared with 53 and 50 respectively). But BL&apos;s performance must be improved if it is to compete effectively in world markets.Productivity: Scale of the problem9.5. On labour productivity many of the comparisons made between BLand its competitors both in the UK and overseas are unfair and unreliable.For example, The Economist published on 1 March a table showing that in1973 BL produced only 5.9 vehicles per man compared with 8.3 for FordUK, 10.1 for Ford Germany, 11.6 for Volkswagen and 14.6 for Renault. but these comparisons do not take into account the type and sophistication of vehicles produced (eg BL&apos;s luxury cars and heavy trucks and buses) or theextent to which bought-in materials and components are used.9.6. Nevertheless, BL accepts that, comparing like with like, its labour productivity is often less than that of its competitors. [An example given here1969/701970/711971/721972/734.0m&apos;0.3m3.4m3.9m5.0m8.0m10.0m7.4m9.0m8.3m13.4m11.3m
is omitted for reasons of commercial security.] Over BL&apos;s car operations as awhole, considerably more manpower is used than the theoretical standardmanpower required. This is partly because of old and outdated plant and machinery and partly because of currently agreed manning levels.9.7. In considering how to deal with these problems, the Team did not attempt to allocate blame for past short-comings. Instead, the approach wasto assess the scope for improvement in the future and to propose actionwhich should achieve this improvement.9.8. We recommend in Chapters 5, 6 and 8 of the Report that thereshould be a major new capital investment programme to modernise BL&apos;sdesign, engineering and production facilities and to provide for a new ration-nationalised model range. Against this background, the Team believe that it is bothessential and feasible to look for significantly greater co-operation between management and workers than in the past, leading to fewer industrial disputes,more realistic manning levels and more mobility and interchangeability oflabour. In our discussions with BL trade union representatives, it wasrepeatedly stressed to us that BL&apos;s workers wanted the Corporation to be a viable and successful enterprise. They accepted that, once the deficiencies of past under-investment had been remedied and any necessary changes made in organisation and management, BL could not expect any continuing subsidyfrom the Government and should be able to compete effectively in world markets. We found ample evidence that BL&apos;s employees at all levels want to make their contribution to solving BL&apos;s problems. The responsible roleadopted by the trade unions at BL over the disputes of recent months issymptomatic of this new attitude. It would be disastrous if, after the Govern-ment announced substantial assistance for BL and the capital expenditure programme was put in hand, the work force no longer felt the same obligationto help constructively in solving BL&apos;s problems.9.9. We must therefore find ways of sustaining and developing the presentconstructive and realistic approach of BL&apos;s workers to the company&apos;s situation.We recommend that the progress of the capital expenditure programme andthe injection of new finance by the Government should be staged. This is dealtwith in more detail in Chapter 15 on the financing of the programme. It mustbe made clear that each stage will depend on evidence that some tangiblecontribution is being made both by BL&apos;s work force and its management tothe reduction of industrial disputes and the improvement of productivity.9.10. The improvement of productivity will inevitably mean a gradual reduction in the number of workers required to produce a given number of vehicles. If, however, the capital expenditure programme goes ahead and BLachieves the increased sales which are planned, any manpower reductions from increased productivity will be partly, perhaps mainly, offset by the expansionof BL&apos;s capacity, and the additional manpower needs arising from that. More-over, although natural labour wastage has drastically reduced over the past year, it is still averaging 7 and 8 per cent and past experience has shown thata substantial response is made to calls for voluntary redundancy from olderworkers. Even so, careful forward manpower planning will be needed,
particularly in areas where some major rationalisation of production facilities is undertaken.Action to improve industrial relations9.11. The essence of our proposals is to promote a deeper sense ofcommitment by BL&apos;s workers to the success of the enterprise on which theirlivelihood depends. To make this possible there must be a major effort toimprove industrial relations within BL. We have considered what specific measures should be taken under three main headings:(i) Payment systems.(ii) Collective bargaining.(iii) Industrial democracy.These matters, as well as BL&apos;s situation and prospects generally, were dis-cussed by the Team at meetings held jointly with representatives of theExecutive Council of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and EngineeringUnions and an elected group of BL shop stewards and staff representatives.The Team also had a meeting with elected representatives of BL&apos;s middlemanagement.Payment systems9.12. Until 1971 BL workers engaged directly in production were paidlargely on a piecework system, and indirect workers had pay structures basedon some derived relationship with piecework earnings. In 1970 BL took theview that the piecework system was a major source of friction, dispute andinequity in the Corporation. The major disadvantages as BL saw it were asfollows:(i) Piecework involved a large number of individual negotiations andbargains at shop floor level.(ii) These negotiations took up a great deal of time and frequently led to industrial disputes for example, arguments over payment forwaiting time.(iii) The introduction of a new model or a modification of a modelinvolved a new round of piecework negotiations and potentialdisputes. (BL claims that the piecework negotiations over the Club-man variant of the Mini took six months and cost 18,000 units inlost production.)(iv) Piecework resulted in wide disparities in pay levels which gave rise tofurther grievances and disputes. (BL claims that in the Cowleyassembly plant 1,000 claims were referred to works manager level inthe last year of piecework.)(v) There was a lack of income security. Lay-offs arising from disputeselsewhere in the Corporation or outside the Corporation could mean a sharp reduction in piecework earnings.9.13. BL therefore decided to move to a system of measured day workbeginning with the workers who were starting production of the Marina inCowley in early 1971. To improve the attractiveness of the new system lay-offpay was also introduced. The change was not welcome to many workers whothought that they fared better under the old system. Although the amount of
time lost through disputes over the changeover was small, BL accepts that inorder to secure acceptance of the measured day work system, they had toagree to manning levels which were often excessive. By September 1974 some94 per cent of BL&apos;s hourly-rated employees were being paid under the daywork system.9.14. BL believes that the new system will eventually bring significantbenefits in improving industrial relations and in making it possible to plan andcontrol production more effectively. In our discussions with BL trade union representatives, they argued that measured day work discouraged improve-ments in labour productivity, because it provided no reward for individualeffort. They accepted that it was not desirable to abandon measured day workand return to piecework. They suggested, however, that in the interests of promoting better labour productivity, BL might introduce some form ofincentive payment to supplement normal measured day work earnings.9.15. The Team consider that there should be no change&quot; in the measuredday work system at present. The move to measured day work has not yetbeen fully digested, and not enough time has elapsed for its advantages and disadvantages to be properly assessed. In particular, BL needs more time towork out acceptable standards of production performance as a basis forjudging the potential for increasing productivity in the future. There is, never-theless, scope for improving the measured day work system by agreementwith the trade unions. This could at some time in the future include theintroduction of some incentive element, and this possibility should be kept under review.Collective bargaining9.16. Collective bargaining arrangements in BL are extremely complex,and like many other aspects of the Corporation, reflect the historical evolution of BL from a large number of small companies. The 170,000 employees aredivided among some 60 plants, 8 divisions and 17 different unions. As a con-sequence, the number of bargaining units (ie separate groups of employeescovered by a single pay agreement on the main terms and conditions of their employment) is very large. There has been some progress in reducing thenumber of units in recent years. For example, at Triumph five separate plantshave been brought together for wage bargaining purposes, hourly-ratedemployees in Jaguar are covered by a single unit, efforts are being made tointegrate all Rover plants into a single hourly-rated bargaining unit and some progress is also being made in Truck and Bus Division. Nevertheless, therestill remain 246 separate units. In one location, Castle Bromwich, there arenine bargaining units for hourly-rated employees. In some locations (egCowley) there is separate bargaining in the Body and Assembly plants,even though pay parity has been established between them.9.17. It is BL&apos;s policy to reduce the number of bargaining units. Theyargue that under the present arrangements the Corporation is in an almostcontinuous bargaining situation. The settlement of a claim in one locationleads to a negotiation in another. The result in their view is to increase theinstability of BL&apos;s industrial relations.
9.18. The trade unions have in the past been suspicious of BL&apos;s wish toreduce the number of bargaining units, because of their opposition, to theintroduction of centralised bargaining on a corporation-wide basis of the kind which operates at Ford. They have, however, agreed to centralised bargainingover pension arrangements.9.19. BL at present negotiates basic wages and conditions of employment(eg the 40 hour week, the four-week holiday entitlement) through theEngineering Employers&apos; Federation (EEF), and this basic agreement is thensupplemented by separate agreements negotiated locally. If BL wanted to change to a system under which basic wages and conditions were negotiatedcentrally for BL as a whole or for major sectors of BL&apos;s activities (eg cars,trucks and buses etc) this would call in question BL&apos;s continued membership of the EEF. Although the EEF would probably not require BL to leave theFederation, it is questionable whether it would make sense for BL to stay,once its basic wages and conditions were no longer negotiated through theEEF. For the time being BL prefers to continue to negotiate through theEEF. We do not recommend any change in this arrangement at present,although BL should keep under review the balance of advantage of itsremaining within the EEF.9.20. Meanwhile, however, there is scope for reducing the number ofbargaining units. In discussion with the Team the trade union representativesshowed sympathy with the idea that there might be further progress towards a reduction in the number of bargaining units, provided that this was achievedgradually. They also recognised that BL would have more scope for delegatingauthority to negotiate to the level of individual bargaining units if these unitswere large enough to have a genuinely separate identity.9.21. Collective bargaining at BL is also complicated by the wide variety of different renewal dates for the various agreements. There would be advantage in substantially reducing the number of dates. In discussions withthe Team, the trade union representatives accepted that this would bebeneficial. The Social Contract guidelines provide the flexibility for arestructuring of this kind on a once-for-all basis.9.22. We therefore recommend that there should be a substantial reduction in the number of bargaining units at BL in the interests of goodindustrial relations and that, in the context of Government financial assistanceto BL, further discussions with the trade unions should be held to work out a phased programme. An interim objective should be to aim at having notmore than one unit for hourly-rated employees and another unit for white-collar employees at each location. An even smaller number might be envisagedeventually to reflect the new organisational structure for BL proposed in chapter 12. A reduction in the number of renewal dates for agreements should also be discussed with the trade unions. Finally, maximum use shouldbe made of the new Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service to settleissues where agreement cannot be reached under the normal bargainingarrangements.
9.23. If full benefit is to be derived from these improvements in the collective bargaining machinery, it is essential that BL line management in the new bargaining units should have sufficient delegated authority tonegotiate effectively. In Chapter 12 on organisation we have proposed a new structure in which BL corporate staffs are drastically reduced, corporatecontrol and co-ordination are kept to the essential minimum, and responsibility and authority are devolved as far down the line as possible. This new approach has special relevance to industrial relations. In recent years, for a variety of reasons, there has been a tendency for BL&apos;s line management tobe seen as having little real authority in bargaining: This tendency must be reversed. There will be a continuing need for a Director of Personnel atcorporate level to advise the Board and Chief Executive on general issues of industrial relations policy and to give guidance to BL line management onnegotiating strategy. But the responsibility for the conduct of negotiationsmust rest, and be seen to rest, with line management in the new bargainingunits.Industrial democracy9.24. The most crucial factor in improving industrial relations at BLand in creating the conditions in which productivity can be increased is,however, that there should be some significant progress towards industrial democracy. Means must be found to take advantage of the ideas, enthusiasmand energy of BL&apos;s workers in planning the future of the business on which their livelihood depends. The objective should be to remove frustrationscaused by management decisions imposed remotely from above. Workers&apos;representatives need to be given more information about their company sothat they can better appreciate managements problems and co-operate moreconstructively in solving those problems.9.25. One of the main problems in devising arrangements of this kindat BL is the complexity of organisation on the trade union side. BL has todeal with seventeen different trade unions co-ordinated nationally in the confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions (CSEU). A great dealof power and influence rests, however, with the shop stewards at plant level.Although there is a British Leyland Shop Stewards Committee, this is an unofficial body which is not recognised by BL or by the trade unions. Thereis therefore no single standing official body which could be said specifically to represent BL&apos;s employees. In order to assist the Team to carry out effectiveconsultations for the Inquiry, the CSEU arranged a meeting of BL shop stewards in Birmingham on 3rd February and this meeting elected twelverepresentatives who were able to join with CSEU representatives in subsequentmeetings with the Team. This arrangement was of great value to the Team.However, the composition of the shop steward representation did not reflect the balance of membership as between different unions or the distribution of employees between different BL divisions and plants. The Team receivedwritten representations from various trade unions both locally and nationallyto the effect that the shop steward delegation was unrepresentative, that ithad not been democratically selected and that the submission being made tothe Team did not properly reflect the views of BL workers. It is clear that,if progress is to be made towards industrial democracy in BL, means must
be found of ensuring that there is adequate and balanced representation ofthe work force.9.26. The trade union representatives put forward written submissionssetting out their proposals for participation. These were framed on theassumption that BL would, as the trade unions recommended, be nation-nationalised. They recognised that if the Government did not find it practicable to take BL wholly into public ownership somewhat different proposals forparticipation would be necessary.9.27. The trade union proposals can be summarised as follows:(i) There would be a series of joint Management/Union committees at all levels operating under an overall Group Board of Manage-ment.(ii) The Committees would consist of elected voting union members with non-voting ex-officio management who would report on andaccount for policies and management.(iii) There would be three levels of Committees:(a) Department Committee directly elected by union members(dealing with the affairs of a factory department).(b) Factory/Area Committee directly elected by union members(dealing with matters affecting a factory or group of factories in an area).(c) Divisional Committee elected by the Factory Committees(this Committee would put forward ideas on the need fordevelopments in the division within the overall strategy of theCorporation, would ensure that the overall strategy wascarried out within the division, and that &quot;agreed financial commitments&apos; were implemented, and would be responsiblefor consultation with the lower level Committees).(iv) The Board of Management would have &quot;overall responsibility forthe general direction of the Corporation^ activities&apos;.(v) The Board would be composed of Union and Government nomineeson a 50/50 basis. Union members would be elected from the divisional Committees while Government nominees would beappointed on a basis of consultation between the Unions and theGovernment. In addition, management would be represented ina non-voting ex-officio capacity.(vi) The Board of Management would appoint the Management Team.The Board would need to sanction &apos;all new policy decisions&apos; bymanagement.(vii) There would be full disclosure of all relevant information at thevarious levels of the organisation.9.28. The trade union proposals raised two main issues which the Teambelieve are best considered separately worker representation on the Boardand improved arrangements for involvement and consultation at divisionaland plant level.
9.29. The proposal for worker representation on the Board raises a major issue of Government policy which is of general significance. TheTeam are aware that the Government is considering the proposals made inthe Labour Party Green Paper The Community and the Company&apos; and inthe tuc&apos;s 1974 Report on industrial democracy for a two-tier board structure-ture in which there would be 50 per cent trade union representation. Theseproposals would involve major changes in company law and in the statutesgoverning the nationalised industries. In our view, consideration of whether there should be eleoted worker representation on the Board of BL shouldbe deferred until the Government has determined its general policy on the composition of company boards and boards of nationalised industries.9.30. We welcome, however, the readiness of the trade union repre-sentatives to consider the setting up of joint management/union committees at divisional, plant and factory department levels. There is already a con-siderable number of management/union committees in BL, as in mostcompanies of this size and type, to discuss particular matters such as pro-duction, safety and the canteen. These committees are mainly at plantlevel. Hitherto these bodies have not been very effective. Mainly this is because there has been inadequate management commitment to the con-consultative process. Discussions have been limited to trivial matters and management has been represented at too junior a level to ensure thatemployee views are genuinely taken into account in decision-taking. Tradeunions, for their part, have often been suspicious of such bodies as eitherineffective or designed to undermine normal bargaining arrangements.Tentative efforts recently by BL to set up a consultative council at corporatelevel have not been welcomed by trade union representatives, partly because;of fears that it might lead to centralised collective bargaining.9.31. We believe that there are several factors which should help insetting up a new and genuinely effective structure of committees to involveBL&apos;s workers in decision-making. The crisis at BL has made all workersacutely aware of the wider issues affecting the future of the Corporation.In order to ensure that the workers understand what is happening and can contribute constructively to solving BL&apos;s problems, it is already accepted that they must be provided with much more information than in the pastabout the Corporation^ performance and future plans. The Government^proposals for planning agreements will also entail discussion of BL&apos;s futureplans by Government, management and workers, subject to safeguards aboutnational security and commercial confidentiality.9.32. The most important reason for setting up a new structure of joint management/union committees is the need to provide a forum inwhich representatives of BL&apos;s workers can contribute effectively to im-proving BL&apos;s efficiency. We have recommended in paragraph 9.9 above that the capital expenditure programme and the injection of government finance should be staged and that each new stage should depend on evidenceof a contribution both by BL&apos;s workers and its management to a reductionin industrial disputes and increased productivity. Such a contribution canbe made only with knowledge and understanding of future plans and in an
atmosphere of joint problem-solving by management and unions. Thereshould be a framework, removed from the normal arrangements for collec-tive bargaining, in which agreement can be reached on the action required.9.33. We therefore recommend that, following this Report, a new structure of joint management/union committees should be worked out inconsultation with the trade unions. The trade union proposals summarised in paragraph 9.27 above seemed to us to go further than is practicable. Overthe next decade, BL will need the highest quality professional managementit can get at all levels. Management must have executive responsibility andmust be given the necessary scope for applying their skills in the interests ofBL and its work force. On the other hand, there would be no point in establishing committees which were purely consultative, were expected todo little more than rubber-stamp management decisions, and which were confined to discussing trivialities. In the proposals outlined below, we have tried to devise machinery which will result in positive agreed action, withouteroding management^ executive responsibility.9.34. We recommend that there should be no joint management/unioncommittee at corporate level. We explain in Chapter 12 why we believe thatBL should be run, as far as possible, as four separate businesses BL Cars,BL Trucks and Buses, BL Special Products and BL International. We there-fore propose that at the top tier of the new committee structure thereshould be two Joint Management Councils the BL Cars Joint Manage-ment Council and the BL Trucks and Buses Joint Management Council.We do not recommend similar arrangements for Special Products and Inter-national. Apart from a small white-collar staff in London, nearly all the employees of BL International are overseas. As explained in Chapter 13,BL Special Products is a holding company for a number of separate under-takings producing diverse products. Arrangements for worker involvementin those undertakings should be developed in ways which take account oftheir particular circumstances and needs and the industries in which theyare operating. \9.35. Below the two main Joint Management Councils, there shouldbe two other tiers of Joint Management Committees. At the higher of thesetwo tiers BL Cars should be divided up into not more than about eightmeaningful units and BL Trucks and Buses should be divided into not morethan about five such units. The units should be broadly consistent with thenew organisation structure proposed in Chapter 12 and also make sensegeographically. These groupings might be based partly on locations (eg theLongbridge complex of plants) and partly on divisional organisation. these committees would be called simply Joint Management Committees withthe appropriate prefix, eg Longbridge Joint Management Committee. the basic tier of the three-tier structure would be a large number of Depart-mental Joint Management Committees for each department or shop.9.36. The composition and terms of reference of these bodies would beas follows:(i) Joint Management Councils for BL Cars and for BL Trucks andBuses
Chairman: Managing Director BL Cars/BL Trucks and Buses.Members: A manageable number (not more than say 15) con-sisting of the senior management team of BL Cars/BLTrucks and Buses, and union representatives drawn one from each of the second tier Joint management committees.Terms of reference:(a) to examine future plans to make BL a more competitive pro-producer of cars (or trucks and buses);(b) to seek as far as possible to reach agreement on these plans,while recognising that executive responsibility rests withmanagement;(c) to keep under review the implementation of these plans,(ii) Joint Management CommitteesChairman: the senior BL executive within the area or division.Members: senior management within the area or division, and senior shop stewards and senior staff association repre-sentatives within the area or division.Terms of reference:(a) to work out, within the framework of the overall plan for BLCars (or Trucks and Buses), more efficient means and methodsof production and improvements in the working environmentin the area of operations covered by the Committee;(b) to seek as far as possible to reach agreement on the action required, while recognising that executive responsibility rests with management;(c) to keep under review the implementation of the action agreed.9.37. We also recommend that, in addition to the Councils and Com-mittees, there should twice a year be two Management/Union Conferences,one for BL Cars and another for BL Trucks and Buses. The Conferenceswould be organised by the relevant Joint Management Council. The BL CarsManagement/Union Conference would be attended by all members of theJoint Management Committees and Departmental Joint Management Com-mittees within BL Cars. The same would apply in BL Trucks and Buses. the relevant Joint Management Council would be on the platform and the Con-ference would provide an opportunity for the Council to give a report on its work over the previous six months and to hear the views and suggestions ofCommittee members both management and unions. Once a year the chief executive of BL should attend each conference. We consider that these Con-ferences are necessary to ensure:(i) that there is adequate liaison between the Councils and committees at the various levels;(ii) that Committee members at both area and divisional level and departmental level have a full sense of involvement in the success ofthe business in which they operate (whether cars or trucks andbuses) as a whole;
(iii) that Committee members at both levels take full account in their work of the overall plans for the business (whether cars or trucks andbuses) as a whole.9.38. We are aware that, in&quot; putting forward these proposals, we are giving a major role to BL&apos;s shop stewards, and particularly its senior shop stewards. We believe that it is essential to the success of any new initiative for joint committees that it should recognise the realities of power and influencewithin the existing employee organisations. Only in this way can BL hope toobtain any genuine commitment on behalf of the work force. It may be argued that some of these shop stewards are motivated by extremist political views and do not act in conformity with the policy of their unions or the interests oftheir members. It must be for the members themselves to recognise the responsibilities which the shop stewards are exercising on their behalf and toensure that the right people are chosen to exercise these responsibilities. Sothat there should be no misunderstanding about the role of the committeesand to secure full participation in their activities by all employees, the widest possible publicity should be given to the setting up of the committees and their terms of reference.9.39. The proposals for joint councils and committees which we have out-lined will require more detailed elaboration in a number of important respects-for example, the basis on which BL Cars can be divided to provide not morethan eight units at the Joint Management Committee level. Moreover, theproposals cannot succeed unless they have support and co-operation fromBL&apos;s trade union representatives and workers. The first step in implementing the proposals must therefore be to explain them fully and discuss them withBL&apos;s management and senior trade union representatives.summary.40. Our recommendations can be summarised as follows:(i) BL cannot succeed unless there is a reduction in the man-hours lostfrom internal industrial disputes and more efficient use both ofexisting capital investment and the proposed additional capital investment.(ii) The new capital expenditure programme and the injection ofGovernment finance into BL should be staged and each new stageshould depend on evidence of a contribution both by the workforce and the management to the reduction of industrial disputes and improved productivity.(iii) There should be no major change in the present system of payment by measured day work; there is, however, scope for improving thesystem, and the possibility of introducing some incentive element in the future should be kept under review.(iv) BL should continue to negotiate basic wages and conditions throughthe Engineering Employers&apos; Federation but should keep underreview the balance of advantage of remaining within the Federation.(v) Discussions should be held with the trade unions about a furthergradual but substantial reduction in the number of collective bar-
gaining units within BL and about a common reduction in thenumber of renewal dates for wage settlements.(vi) To enable BL&apos;s workers to contribute constructively to solving BL&apos;sproblems, there should be a new structure of joint managementcouncils, committees and conferences on the lines proposed inparagraphs 9.33 to 9.38.(vii) So that there should be no misunderstanding about the role ofthese new bodies and to secure full participation in their activitiesby all employees, the widest possible publicity should be given totheir establishment and terms of reference.(viii) The first step in implementing the proposals must be to explain themfully and discuss them with BL&apos;s management and senior tradeunion representatives.CHAPTER 10Distribution[This Chapter discusses BL&apos;s arrangements for distribution and relation-ships with its distributors and dealers in the UK, and is omitted for reasons ofcommercial security.]chapter 11Controls and systems[This Chapter describes and assesses the management controls and sys-tems operated within BL and is omitted for reasons of commercial security.]CHAPTER 12Organisation and managementPresent organisation12.1. The present organisation of BL, as adopted in November 1974, isshown in Chart 12.1. It has the following main features:(i) The Chairman is also the Chief Executive; there is no formal statement of the extent to which the ultimate responsibility for
the day to day operations of the Corporation rests with theChairman as Chief Executive or has been delegated to the managing Director.(ii) It is a mixture of an organisation based on products (trucks andbuses and three separate groups of cars Austin Morris, RoverTriumph and Jaguar) and an organisation based on functions (egthe two manufacturing divisions, Body and Assembly and Powerand Transmission, and the International Division, responsibleinter alia for BL&apos;s overseas marketing).(iii) As a result, an unusually large number of line divisions nine inall report direct to the Managing Director; in fact, since thereis at present no head of the International Division, the six directorsor managing directors of the various international operationsreport to the Managing Director who thus has fourteen directsubordinates with line responsibility.(iv) In order to assist the Managing Director in exercising these responsibilities, there is a large corporate staff under some fifteensenior executives who also report direct to him, although they areloosely grouped under the five most senior of their number.12.2. The steps which led to the present organisation are outlined inChart 12.2. When BL was formed in 1968 by the merger of Leyland Motorsand British Motor Holdings, themselves the result of a series of mergers overthe previous two decades, the form of organisation reflected the earliercompany structure Austin Morris (formerly BMC), Pressed Steel and Jaguarfrom BMH, and Rover Triumph and Truck and Bus from Leyland. Althoughit was the declared intention at the time of the merger in 1968 in a documentsigned by Sir George Harriman and Lord Stokes that the Corporation shouldnot be a holding company with largely autonomous subsidiaries but an integrated&apos; organisation, the basic structure remained little changed until thetwo re-organisations of 1974. It is generally accepted that there were conflict-ing schools of thought within the Corporation some working towards fullintegration and others hoping to preserve the independence of the old com-pany structure. The present form of organisation is largely the result of thesehistorical factors. The large Austin Morris/Pressed Steel operation has been broken down into separate divisions but the Rover Triumph and JaguarDivisions remain mostly unchanged except for the loss of their parts and KD(&quot;knocked down&apos;) activities to the newly created Parts and KD Division. Theother main feature of the past few years has been the building up of a largecorporate staff.Defects of present organisation12.3. We consider that the present organisational structure has seriousdefects and has significantly harmful effects both on the efficiency of BL&apos;operations and on its future development. The organisation is now generally accepted as unsatisfactory by the higher management of BL and is defendedonly as an interim arrangement. There are, however, no agreed plans withinBL about the eventual form of organisation which should be adopted or the timetable for achieving it.
12.4. In brief, the present structure of BL combines most of the dis-advantages of both centralised and decentralised organisations with few ofthe advantages of either. In particular, the main defeots are as follows:(i) There is inadequate co-ordination and integration of the productplanning, engineering, manufacturing and marketing of cars.(ii) Co-ordination within the car business as well as co-co-ordination between the car business and BL&apos;s other activities is the responsi-bility of the Deputy Chairman and Managing Director who thushas too wide a span of detailed control.(iii) The creation of large corporate staffs to assist him to carry out these responsibilities has further increased the number of execu-tives reporting directly to him (14 line plus 5 to 15 staff).(iv) The resulting complex of line/staff relationships leads to lengthydiscussions both in formal committees and ad hoc groups and delays decisions.(v) The extensive use of corporate staffs undermines the authority and responsibility of line management without bringing them undereffective control.(vi) The Truck and Bus Division and the International operations have suffered from the concentration of effort and resources at headquarters on the co-ordination of the UK car operations.12.5. These basic defects in the organisational structure have been aggravated by a reluctance in BL&apos;s top management to delegate responsibility.Principles for a new organisation12.6. In considering what should be the new organisational structure wehave been guided by the following main principles:(i) We do not believe that the Corporation as a whole is too largeto be manageable, given the right organisational structure and theright management. There are advantages for BL in being a pro-producer both of cars and of trucks and buses. There would, however,be advantage in dividing up BL&apos;s activities, within the overallcorporate structure, into separate businesses which would be profitcentres in their own right.(ii) The new structure must facilitate and not impede the policies ofproduct rationalisation and re-organisation of production facilitiesoutlined in Chapters 5 and 8.(iii) The Chairman should be non-executive. The Chief Executiveshould have full authority and responsibility for the operations ofthe Corporation as a whole.(iv) The Chief Executive should have only as many people reportingto him as he can effectively control directly.(v) The corporate staff should be drastically reduced to those functionswhere a corporate co-ordinated approach is essential.(vi) Management responsibility should be delegated down the line tothe maximum possible extent and the main units into which the
Corporation is divided should be given the maximum possibleautonomy within the overall corporate framework,(vii) In order to put an end to the organisational tensions anduncertainties from which BL has suffered over the past 7 years,the structure we propose should be announced immediately andimplemented as a single stage operation without delay, rather thanevolved through various interim stages over a number of years.Proposed new structure12.7 We have aimed to divide up the Corporation into identifiable units which are large enough to operate as coherent and separate entities. Threesectors of BL&apos;s activities can be readily recognised as separate operations Truck and Bus, Special Products and International.12.8. The production and marketing of trucks and buses have specialcharacteristics. These vehicles are more complex and expensive and lendthemselves less easily to techniques&apos;of volume production. The purchaserstend to be large companies or public authorities and there is a need for close contact between purchaser and manufacturer, sometimes extending to thedevelopment of special designs or modifications. BL&apos;s truck and bus activities are already organised in a separate division. We believe that the truck and busbusiness will be better able to realise its full potential if it is recognised as a profit centre in its own right and is given maximum autonomy within the overall framework of the Corporation.12.9. Similarly Special Products Division already operates largely as an industrial holding company within BL. We recommend that it should continueto do so, as a separate profit centre. It should, however, incorporate PrestcoldLtd which is at present a separate company outside the BL divisional structure.The foundry activities of Special Products Division are more closely linked with vehicle manufacturing and should be integrated with BL&apos;s car and truckand bus operations, joining the foundries already under the present manu-facturing divisions.12.10. Although the present BL organisation chart (Chart 12.1) refers toan International division there is in fact no satisfactory structure for BL&apos;overseas manufacturing and distribution. There is no head of the division andthe various overseas directors and managing directors report directly to theCorporation Managing Director and, in some cases, direct to the Chairman.The staffs dealing with international activities in London appear to be largelyconfined to co-ordination and monitoring. This vital sector of BL&apos;s operationsthus has no effective voice to argue on its behalf at corporate level. We there-fore propose that a new and more effective International Division should be created under its own Managing Director who would have a seat on the Board.With a small staff in London he would be responsible for BL&apos;s overseas manu-facturing and distributive operations as a separate profit centre with maximumautonomy within the overall framework of the Corporation. In particular theInternational Division would have considerable freedom to fix the prices ofBL&apos;s products in overseas markets, subject to overall corporate pricing policy.The head of the Division would be expected to formulate and press the case
for a forward strategy in overseas markets, where BL is generally believed to have missed valuable opportunities in recent years.Cars: Main structure12.11. The major issue for consideration has, however, been the organisa-tion of the car activities of BL. We considered the following options:(i) The amalgamation of the present six car divisions, partly functionaland partly product-based, into a single car business.(ii) Re-organisation into three divisions based on product groupings Austin Morris, Rover Triumph and Jaguar.(iii) Re-organisation into two divisions based on product groupings an Austin Morris (Volume car&apos;) division and a Jaguar, RoverTriumph (&quot;specialist car&apos;) division.(iv) Re-organisation into two divisions based on product groupings-anAustin Morris/Rover Triumph division and a Jaguar division.12.12. We concluded that the creation of a single integrated car business as a separate profit centre within the Corporation would best serve theinterests of BL in the future. We recognised the strength of the arguments which have preserved the separate identity of the Rover Triumph and Jaguardivisions within the Corporation since the merger the need to preserve the distinctive product identity of the Specialist&apos; cars and the loyalty of employeesat all levels within these divisions to the old company structures. BL cannot,however, compete successfully as a producer of cars unless it can make themost effective use of all its design, engineering, manufacturing and marketingresources. BL cannot afford to develop, produce and market competing models.It must use the minimum possible number of different body shells, power andtransmission units and components. Manufacturing facilities must also be deployed flexibly. Our proposals on these matters are set out in Chapters 5,6 and 8. We do not believe that these policies can be satisfactorily imple-mented with a structure under which Austin Morris, Rover Triumph andJaguar are separate entities. This argument applies equally to options (ii), (iii)and (iv) above. Under the product-based approach the task of co-co-ordination between the various car operations would, as now, be a matter for the managing Director, the corporate staffs and committees. We do not considerthat this arrangement has worked satisfactorily in the past, and it would beeven less likely to operate satisfactorily if, as we believe is essential, the cardivisions were genuinely separate profit centres.12.13. We therefore propose that, in addition to the three profit centresidentified in paragraphs 12.7 to 12.10 (Trucks and Buses, Special Products and international), the whole of BL&apos;s car operations should form a separate profitcentre. We do not believe that this need detract from the distinctive productidentities of the Specialist&apos; cars. Moreover, although the car business will be large, we believe that it can be organised internally into manageable andaccountable units.Planning and control12.14. The Managing Directors of the four separate profit centres would operate within the framework of a corporate plan for BL as a whole covering
a period of five to seven years and a set of annual business plans for each ofthe four operations. BL does not at present have a system of planning of thiskind.12.15. Under the new proposals the corporate plan would be prepared in the following way. The general assumptions and parameters (for exampleon economic trends) would be provided from the centre. The four separatebusinesses would then put forward their plans on all aspects of their opera-tions for the next five to seven years which, after review and discussion between the Chief Executive and the Managing Directors, would be weldedinto a coherent corporate plan. Particularly in the early years of the newplanning arrangements the major contribution to the development of the forward plans would inevitably come from the four separate businessesrather than from the centre. After approval by the Board the corporateplan would set the framework for the Corporation^ activities for the next five to seven years and it would be rolled forward annually.12.16. Similarly each of the four Managing Directors would putforward his annual business plan in the light of the current corporate plan.This would not be a purely financial document, but would set out objectives for all aspects of the business, including product development, production,marketing and manpower, the action required to achieve these objectives andthe expected results in terms of cash flow and profits throughout the period.These business plans would be reviewed by the Chief Executive and com-commitments would be agreed by the Chief Executive and the managing director concerned and approved by the Board. Performance would be reviewed regularly and the Managing Directors would be answerable to theChief Executive for variances from their commitments. The ManagingDirectors would be expected to adopt the same approach to the control and supervision of the levels of management below them.12.17. An important feature of the new profit centre concept would bethat each of the four separate businesses would be expected to service theappropriate proportion of BL&apos;s borrowings.Corporate organisation12.18. The corporate staff would be kept to the absolute minimum necessary to enable the Chief Executive to carry out his co-ordinating andmonitoring responsibilities. The philosophy should be that the bulk of staffresources should be located in the four separate businesses. Apart from asmall corporate public relations staff, the staffs at corporate level would be confined to:Finance, planning and control(the emphasis would be on the development of sound future plans and onmonitoring performance against commitments).Secretarial, legal and corporate auditor(the corporate internal auditing function is grouped with the Secretarialfunction to provide an independent counter-balance to the finance functionas conceived above).
Personnel(this would include the formulation and co-ordination of industrial relationspolicy; responsibility for industrial relations negotiations would be atdivisional or plant level).The total number of staff required for these functions at corporatelevel should be the minimum and very much less than the present total of around 1,000 (some 550 in London and some 450 in Coventry). There shouldbe a consequent reduction in office accommodation in Central London.There would need to be an increase in staff below corporate level, par-ticularly in the car activity as explained below. The proposed corporateorganisation is shown in Chart 12.3.Board membership12.19. We propose that, in addition to the non-executive chairman and the Chief Executive, the Board of the Corporation should include the managing Directors of Cars, Trucks and Buses, International, and SpecialProducts and, because of the crucial importance of these functions, theDirector of Finance, Planning and Control and the Director of Personnel.We also consider that at present the Secretarial function should be repre-sented on the Board, because of the long experience of the current holderof that post (see below under Management). In addition to the executivedirectors there should be three or four part-time non-executive board members with industrial and commercial experience.Nomenclature12.20. At present BL is organised into divisions. In order to underlinethe new profit centre approach, to reflect the size and importance of the newintegrated car business, and to develop loyalty to the new units, we suggestthat the four components of the Corporation should no longer be described as divisions but should be called:British Leyland Cars;British Leyland Trucks and Buses;British Leyland International; andBritish Leyland Special Products.Organisation below Corporate level12.21. The proposed internal organisation of Trucks and Buses, Inter-national and Special Products is shown in Charts 12.4, 12.5 and 12.6 respec-tively. Although there are no major differences from the present internalstructure of those divisions they will, as explained earlier, operate with muchmore autonomy, and British Leyland International will have a much more positive role.12.22. We have given detailed consideration to the internal organisationof British Leyland Cars which will account for the major part of the Corpora-tion&apos;s turnover. The main reason for amalgamating the car activities into asingle entity is to achieve the maximum possible integration of engineering,production and marketing. We therefore propose that the internal organisationof British Leyland Cars should reflect this objective and that it should be composed of four fine divisions one dealing with product planning, develop-
ment and engineering, one with manufacturing, one with sales and marketingand one with parts and KD. The structure is set out in Chart 12.7.12.23. We are not including in the report any detailed recommendations about the organisation of the divisions within British Leyland Cars. Weconsider that this is primarily a matter for the new management to decide.We have, however, developed proposals which we would be ready to discuss with the new management at a later stage.[Paragraphs 12.24 and 12.25, which contain the Team&apos;s proposals forappointments at the higher levels in the new organisational structure, havebeen omitted.]

Special products[This Chapter, which provides detailed information about the operations and prospects of BL&apos;s Special Products Division and Prestcold Limited, isomitted for reasons of commercial - security.]CHAPTER 14Cost of the programme14.1 Chapters 5 to 12 set out a programme to make BL a viable and fully competitive vehicle producer. This has the following main elements:(0  the introduction of a new and rationalised model range;(ii) the modernisation and reorganisation of production facilities;(iii) a vigorous marketing effort to maintain and increase sales, especiallyin Western Europe;(iv) radical changes in BL&apos;s organisation and management;(v) a contribution from BL&apos;s employees, through new machinery for wor-ker participation, to the reduction of industrial disputes and an im-provement in productivity.14.2 This chapter assesses the financial consequences of this programmeunder the following headings up to and including BL&apos;s financial year 1981/82:(0  the capital expenditure required;(ii) the estimated additional need for working capital;(iii) the forecast profits;(iv) the scale of funds to be provided from external sources.14.3 The programme has been costed both in constant price terms (ie basedon average 1974/75 costs and selling prices) and in inflated price terms. It isdesirable to make an inflation adjustment because, as explained in Chapter4, inflation at current rates has a major effect on cash flow and financing. the inflation assumptions used, for illustrative purposes, are as followsBL financial years to end September1974/75 ......     ...... 22i%1975/76 ...     ......... 15%1976/77 ............ 12i%1977/78 ............ 12i%1978/79 ............ 12i%thereafter ............ 10%
The inflation assumptions used for the later years are, of course, highlyspeculative. The detailed proposals for raising finance in Chapter 15 of theReport do not however go beyond September 1978 and the forecasts of profit as a percentage of sales discussed later in this Chapter are not signi-ficantly affected by different inflation assumptions.Capital expenditure14.4 The capital expenditure requirement over the eight years to endSeptember 1982 is estimated at  1,264 million in constant price terms and 2,090 million in inflated price terms. In constant prices the annual capitalexpenditure rises from  102 million in 1974/75 to  215 million in 1977/78and then declines to  112 million in 1981/82. Throughout this period theannual capital expenditure will be considerably higher than in any yearsince BL was formed in 1968, even allowing for inflation.14.5 The breakdown of the expenditure is shown in the following table:Table 14.1BL&apos;s capital expenditure requirementI m ^ at inflated prices as defined in paragraph 14.3Year ended 30th SeptemberSub-	1975	1976	7977	1978	total	1979	1980	1981	1982	Total	I m	I m	I m	I m	I m	I m	I m	I m	I m	l mCar operations	83	106	167	249	605	249	262	255	204	1,575Truck and Bus	7	37	64	64	172	43	48	43	40	346Special Products	4	8	6	6	24	8	15	8	7&apos;	62International	8	18	11	12	49	16	20	14	8	107Total (inflated										prices terms)	102	169	248	331	850	316	345	320	259.	2,090Total (constant										price terms)	102	138	181	215	636	182.	181	153	112	1,26414.6 As the table shows, about three-quarters of the capital expenditure will be in the car operations. Of this total for cars of some  1,500 million in inflated price terms, some  1,000m will be capital expenditure arising fromthe introduction of new products and the improvement of existing products(e.g. model facelifts). In fact the split between expenditure on new products and expenditure on the modernisation of facilities is somewhat arbitrary.The introduction of a new model normally involves substantial replacement of existing plant and machinery. The Team&apos;s proposals about BL&apos;s productrange are set out in Chapter 5. The capital expenditure details are set out inthe following table:[Table 14.2 is omitted for reasons of commercial security.]14.7 Nearly  400 million in inflated price terms will be required for expenditure on the modernisation  of car production and engineering
facilities. The case for such expenditure is argued in Chapters 6 and 8. an indication of the breakdown of the expenditure is given in the followingtable:[Table 14.3 is omitted for reasons of commercial security.]14.8 The capital expenditure required for the truck and bus operationsis estimated at  346 million in inflated price terms. Of this some two-thirds( 239 million) will be concerned with the modernisation of production facilities. The annual breakdown is set out in the following table:[Table 14.4 is omitted for reasons of commercial security.]Working capital14.9 With the benefit of this capital expenditure, and the new modelrange, and in accordance with the marketing objectives set out in Chapter 5,total sales of BL are forecast to increase from  1,885 milUon in 1974/75to  2,790 million in 1981/82 in constant price terms ( 5,935 million ininflated price terms). This will require a substantial increase in BL&apos;s working capital. As explained in Chapter 4 (paragraph 4.12), BL&apos;s net operatingassets were run down to unusually low levels during 1973 and 1974 ( 122million representing 7.8 per cent of annual turnover at 30th September 1973,and  139 million representing 8.7 per cent of annual turnover at 30th Septem-ber 1974). It is assumed that in order to maintain adequate levels of stocksBL will need to have net operating assets at about 15 per cent of annualturnover throughout the period to end September 1982. This would involve an increase in net operating assets from end September 1974 to a level of 891 million at end September 1982, ie an increase of some  750 million ininflated price terms, or some  260 million in constant price terms.Profit forecast14.10 The cost of the programme to end September 1982 in terms ofthe additional requirement both for investment in fixed capital and for working capital is therefore forecast to be some  1,500 million in constant price terms and some  2,800 million in inflated price terms. In order todecide whether the provision of additional resources on this scale can bejustified, it is necessary to forecast how far the programme will improveBL&apos;s profitaibility. In doing so, two important considerations must be borne in mind:(0 in a company like BL where there is an immense backlog of moderni-sation to be caught up, several years must inevitably elapse beforeeven quite substantial amounts of new investment begin to have a significant effect on profitaibility;(ii) profit forecasts for a period as far ahead as 1981/82 must inevitably be based on a wide range of assumptions about matters such as markettrends, exchange rates etc and these are listed in Annex 14.1; although in the tables that follow, figures are provided to the nearest  1 million for illustrative and arithmetical convenience, this should not be taken as implying that the forecasts have that degree of precision or relia-bility.
14.11 One important area in which assumptions have to he made isthe contribution to be expected from the work force in improving efficiencyby agreeing to manning reductions and greater mobility and interchange-ability of labour. Over the 8 years to end September 1982, a benefit of some 400 million has been allowed for these factors nearly a quarter of the forecast cumulative profit before interest and tax. We consider that animprovement of this kind is feasible in the context of the new capital expen-diture and the new approach to industrial relations and worker participationoutlined in Chapter 9- Depending on the success of this approach, evenbigger improvements in efficiency might be obtained. If, on the other hand,no substantial improvement is achieved, particularly in the early lean yearsof the period, BL&apos;s viability will be put in jeopardy and it will be much lesseasy to justify the later stages of the capital investment programme.14.12 The following table forecasts the sales and profitability of BL,on the assumption that funds will be available to finance the proposed capitalexpenditure programme and additional working capital required and inaccordance with the assumptions in Annex 14.1:[Table 14.5 is omitted for reasons of commercial security.]The table shows that profits before depreciation and amortisation, interestand tax as a percentage of sales are expected to increase to 11.0 per cent in1981/82 compared with an average of 6.5 per cent in the period 1968/69 to1973/74. It also shows that BL would earn enough profit to cover interest onthe assumption (which is unrealistic, for the reasons explained in Chapter 15)that all additional requirements for capital could be provided by borrowingsbearing interest at 12 per cent.14.13 There is also an improvement in the return on BL&apos;s capital employed,as is shown in the following table:[Table 14.6 is omitted for reasons of commercial security.]The table shows that profit before all interest and tax as a percentageof total capital employed is forecast to increase to 19.6 per cent in 1981/82compared with an average of 9-6 per cent in the period of 1968/69 to1973/74. While we recognise that this is not a satisfactory return, it must be appreciated that it is caused by massive under-investment in the past. After1982 BL should start to reap the benefits of the new capital expenditure programme.Funds required from external sources14.14 The following table shows the effect of the capital expenditure pro-gramme and the increase in working capital on BL&apos;s cash flow:[Table 14.7 is omitted for reasons of commercial security.]14.15 It is clear, therefore, that although BL is forecast to achieve a positive cash flow in 1981/82, there is likely to be a requirement for funds from external sources during the period 1974/75 to 1980/81 of  1,300 million to  1,400 million in inflated price terms. As explained earlier, the require-ments for the later years are less certain, and it is preferable therefore to
concentrate on the requirement for the period to end September 1978. Onthe basis of Table 14.7 this would appear to be of the order of  900 million in inflated price terms. Proposals for financing this requirement and the implications for Government involvement in the ownership and control ofBL are discussed in Chapter 15.14.16 The financial consequences of the programme we propose can besummarised as follows:(0 There is a capital expenditure requirement for the eight years to endSeptember 1982 of  1,264 million in constant price terms or  2,090million in inflated price terms.(ii) An increased provision for working capital is required of around  260million in constant price terms or  750 million in inflated price terms.(iii) After allowing for improvements in efficiency, BL&apos;s profits as a per-centage of sales are forecast to improve to 11.0 per cent in 1981/82compared with an average of 6.5 per cent in the period 1968/69 to1973/74.(iv) BL&apos;s return on capital employed is forecast to improve to 19.6 percent in 1981/82 compared with an average of 9.6 per cent in theperiod 1968/69 to 1973/74.(v) On the assumption (which is in practice unrealistic) that all BL&apos;s addi-tional requirements for capital were to be met by borrowings at an interest rate of 12 per cent per annum, BL would earn enough profitsto cover the interest.(vi) In inflated price terms, the funds to be provided from external sourcesare forecast to be of the order of  1,300 million to  1,400 million, ofwhich some  900 million is likely to be required before end September1978.
ANNEX 14.1Main assumptions underlying the profit forecasts inTables 14.5, 14.6 and 14.71 The annual rates of inflation will be:BL financial years to end September1974/75 ............ 22i%1975/76 .........      ... 15%1976/77 ......      ...... 12i%1977/78 ...      ...      ...      ... 12 %1978/79 ............ 12i%thereafter ...     ......... 10%2 Except to a minor degree, the inflation rates used will apply world wide,or to the extent that they do not, there will be compensating adjustments incurrency exchange rates.3 Inflation rates will apply &apos; across the board&apos;; in other words the ratesassumed will be equally valid for wage increases, material, costs, selling prices and capital costs.4 Where profit is given after interest an interest rate of 12 per cent will apply throughout the period on all borrowing other than fixed term borrowingswhich existed at 30th September 1974.5 Total demand for vehicles in world markets up to 1985 will be as set outin Chapter 2.6 BL will retain around 33 per cent of the UK car market and will increase its penetration in the Western European car market from under 3 per cent to nearly 3.6 per cent by 1981 /82 (rising subsequently, outside the forecast period,to 3.9 per cent by 1984/85).7 There will be a benefit of some  400 million cumulative to end September1982 through improved industrial relations, manning reductions and greaterinterchangeability and mobility of labour as a result of the measures proposedin Chapter 9.8 The new capital expenditure programme and the other main recommenda-tions in the report about the product plan, production and engineering facilities and changes in organisation and management are implemented without delay.
Financing of the programme15.1 Chapter 14 indicated the scale of funds which would need to be pro-vided both in the period up to the end of September 1978 and, with lesscertainty, over the subsequent four years to the end of September 1982, in orderto put BL on to a viable and profitable basis. This Chapter sets out the Team&apos;sproposals on how these additional funds should be provided and on the extentto which the Government should become involved in the ownership and controlof BL.Nature of the problem15.2 Table 14.7 showed that BL is forecast to have a negative cash flowamounting cumulatively to nearly  1,400 million in inflated price terms by theend of September 1981. Thereafter there is a cash inflow. On the assumptionthat this negative cash flow of  1,400 million was to be financed by borrowingat the rate of 12 per cent per annum, it is forecast that BL would generateenough profit to pay the interest although clearly, dn view of the need to retainprofits to finance investment, there would be nothing available for dividends.Moreover borrowings would rise (in inflated price terms) from some  135million at end September 1974 to  1,507 million at end September 1981. Thisis shown in the following table:[Table 15.1 is omitted for reasons of commercial security.]15.3 It is clear therefore that, irrespective of the borrowing limits explained in Annex 4.1 to Chapter 4, BL would become grossly over-burdened with fixedinterest capital. Borrowings as a percentage of shareholders&apos; funds would rise from 188 per cent at end September 1975 to 475 per cent by end September1978.15.4 It would be impossible for BL to finance the programme which wehave proposed, and which is vital to BL&apos;s competitiveness in the longer term,from commercial sources. BL is already in short term financial difficulty (see chapter 4) and the present Government guarantee of  50 million is not likelyto cover the position much longer. BL cannot therefore survive unless theGovernment is ready to provide a very large part of the funds required fromexternal sources amounting to  900 million in the period to end September1978 and the funds necessary in the period from then to end September 1982.Justification for a Government contribution15.5 There is in our view an overwhelmingly strong case for financial assis-tance from the Government to make BL a viable and internationally competi-tive vehicle producer. As explained in Chapter 3, BL is one of our majorexporters and, so long as it maintains its present one-third share of the UK
car market, makes a major contribution to saving imports. It has 170,000employees and provides jobs indirectly for many hundreds of thousands more.The world market for cars and commercial vehicles, while not growing as fast as in recent years, nevertheless, as Chapter 2 shows, provides considerableopportunities for BL over the next decade. We consider that a major new capital investment programme combined with improvements in labour produc-tivity, should by the nineteen eighties substantially improve BL&apos;s profits and return on capital employed (see Chapter 14: Tables 14.5 and 14.6). In ourview, therefore, although BL&apos;s requirements for additional funds are large, theeconomic arguments fully justify a Government contribution of this order.Method of Government intervention15.6 On the assumption that the Government will be prepared to accept responsibility for meeting BL&apos;s needs for additional funds, we have consideredhow the Government might best intervene. The present equity shareholdershave in practice lost their investment and it might therefore be argued that theright course should be to withhold further assistance and allow BL to go intoreceivership. The Government would then purchase BL from the receiver andit would become a wholly Government owned company. There are howeververy strong arguments against this. Receivership would be widely misunder-stood by BL&apos;s customers and suppliers particularly abroad and by its em-ployees. The damage to BL&apos;s commercial reputation and the unsettlingeffect on BL&apos;s industrial relations could be very serious. The results wouldbe even more harmful than when Rolls-Royce went into receivership sinceBL is in a consumer oriented industry.15.7 We have assumed therefore that the Government will wish to avoid a receivership. We have also assumed for the purposes of this Report, although this is a matter for political decision, that the Government will not wish tointroduce a special hybrid Bill to take BL compulsorily into public ownership.15.8 The broad outline of our proposal is therefore as follows:(0 The Government should concern itself at present with the financing of the first stage of BL&apos;s requirements (ie the  900 million which,depending on the rate of inflation, is likely to be required before endSeptember 1978) and, while recognising that further finance is likelyto be required in the period from end September 1978 to end Septem-ber 1982, should defer consideration of the method of financingduring this second period.(ii) Part of the first stage requirement should be provided as new equity capital so as to give BL a reasonable debt/equity ratio; the remaindershould take the form partly of long term loans from the Government,partly (if this can be arranged) of long term loans from institutions,and partly of short term overdraft facilities from the banks.(iii) Since the Government, through the provision of new equity capital, islikely to have a dominating shareholding in BL, an offer should bemade to purchase the existing share capital of BL.0&apos;v)  Before the new equity capital can be provided it will be necessary to reorganise BL&apos;s capital structure through a Scheme of Arrangement,(v)  The sequence of events would be:
(a) Offer for the existing share capital and, at the same time, a capital reconstruction through a Scheme of Arrangement.(b) Provision of new equity capital.(c) Provision of long term loan capital.Scale of new equity capital required15.9 The requirement for funds from external sources (see paragraph 15.4)is  900 million in the period to end September 1978. Of this some  200 million is available from current overdraft facilities, leaving a balance of  700 million.In order to provide a reasonable debt/equity ratio we propose that the new capital to be provided should take the following form:New equity capital......      200 millionNew long term loans      ...      500 millionOffer to existing shareholders15.10 Details of BL&apos;s existing capital structure are given in Annex 4.1 toChapter 4. BL&apos;s existing shares have a nominal value of 25p. Shareholderswho subscribed to the February 1972 rights issue did so at a price of 45p pershare. At mid-March 1975 however the price was 8p per share and BL&apos;smarket capitalisation was about  48 million. At September 1974 the &apos;book&apos;value of net assets per share was approximately 43p; this is not, in our view,anything like a realisable or realistic figure, and is therefore irrelevant.15.11 Since it is intended that the Government should be ready to providenew equity capital amounting to some  200 million, this could clearly dwarfthe existing equity capital. We therefore suggest that present shareholdersshould be given an opportunity to sell their shares. This would not only help to protect the Government from the charge of being in a position where itcould oppress minority shareholders but would also, to the extent that theoffer is accepted, give the Government a larger stake in the ownership of BL.15.12 In our judgment the Government should offer lOp per existing shareof 25p nominal value. This judgment is not based on any fixed relationship with the present market price of 8p but on a view of what might be regardedas fair in all the circumstances. The proposal to reconstruct the capital andto provide new equity capital would be known at the time of the offer. If this offer were accepted by all the existing shareholders the cost would be around 60 million.15.13 [This paragraph, which comments on the likely attitude of BL share-holders to the offer, is omitted.]Capital reconstruction15.14 The par value of 25p of the existing ordinary shares is clearly inexcess of their present market value. Under the Companies Act 1948 sharescannot be issued at a substantial discount from par value without the approvalof shareholders and of the Court. We do not believe this to be a practicablecourse. In addition it is not possible for BL to issue ordinary shares of a lowernominal value as the purpose of creating suoh shares would be to have divid-end and capital rights more favourable than those attached to the existing
ordinary share capital of BL and this is precluded by the terms of BL&apos;s out-standing convertible unsecured loan stock. BL therefore cannot do this with-out the consent of the Convertible Unsecured Loan Stockholders and there isno apparent incentive to them to agree to this change.15.15 We recommend that the Corporation should be reconstructed in sucha way that its Ordinary shares stand at a reasonable premium over their parvalue. This should be achieved by the creation of a new company which wouldmake an offer for the existing share capital of BL. We suggest that a new company, say BL 1975, be formed with an authorised capital of ordinary shares of 50p nominal value sufficient to permit the offer and the subsequentrights issue. Under a Scheme of Arrangement under Section 206 of The Com-panies Act 1948 BL 1975 would offer to acquire the existing share capital ofBL on the basis of 1 new share of 50p for every 10 existing shares of 25p. Atthe same time the Government would offer to acquire each new Ordinary shareallotted at a price of  1 per share (equivalent to lOp per existing Ordinaryshare of 25p). The Convertible Loan Stockholders would be entitled to converttheir stock and accept the offer. It is unlikely, however, that they would do this because the market value of the loan stock exceeds the value of the offer for the underlying Ordinary shares. We suggest that BL 1975, as part of theScheme of Arrangement, offers to acquire the existing convertible loan stockin exchange for an issue of a new convertible loan stock in BL 1975 whichwould carry suitably adjusted terms.15.16 The scheme for the Ordinary shares would require the approval of a simple majority of those shareholders present and voting at the Meeting butrepresenting (in person or by proxy) not less than three-fourths in number ofthe shares held by those voting. A Scheme of Arrangement would bind allshareholders and all Convertible Loan Stockholders and would therefore avoid any problem of minority interests in BL as a subsidiary of BL 1975. A Schemeof Arrangement would also provide the opportunity effectively to cancel BL&apos;s share incentive scheme. Following the reconstruction and before the rightsissue BL 1975 would have an issued share capital of approximately 60 millionOrdinary shares with a nominal value of  30 million and a market capitalisa-tion as before (taking the market price of 8p per existing share) of  48 millionequivalent to 80p per Ordinary share of 50p.Rights issue15.17 When the capital has been reconstructed, it will be possible to raisethe additional  200 million of new capital. Ordinary shareholders of any public quoted company are normally entitled to have first subscription rightson any issue of new equity capital. Consequently, the appropriate way bywhich the Government can provide new equity capital to BL is by under-writing a rights issue to existing shareholders and holders of convertible un-secured loan stock. The Government will have itself become an ordinaryshareholder under the terms of the offer (paragraphs 15.10 to 15.13) and accordingly will have acquired rights to subscribe for some of the new shares.In addition it is likely that most of the existing shareholders will not wish toput new money into BL and will not therefore take up their rights which willbe left with the Government as underwriter.
15.18 We propose that the  200 million should be raised by an issue of 200million of the new Ordinary shares of 50p each (following the reconstructionreferred to in paragraph 15.15) at a price of lOOp per share, in the proportionof 10 new shares for every 3 Ordinary shares then held; the holders of theexisting Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock would also have rights to subscribebased on the assumption that they had approved the exchange of their existingstock for an equivalent stock of BL 1975.15.19 The new issue of  200 million would represent about 77 per cent ofthe enlarged capital. The Governments ultimate equity holding would dependon the degree of acceptance of the offer and of the rights taken up by theexisting shareholders. [The remainder of this paragraph gives the Team&apos;s viewabout the percentage of the enlarged equity capital likely to be acquired bythe Government.]Loan capital and overdraft15.20 As explained in paragraph 15.9, BL will in the period to end Septem-ber 1978 require, in addition to new equity capital of  200 million, new longterm loan capital amounting to some  500 million. We therefore propose thatit should be a term of the rights issue that the Government would provide further finance of a specified amount by way of interest bearing 15 to 20 yearloan capital. In addition it might be made a condition that, if the Government,following the offer and rights issue, had an equity participation of not less than75 per cent, the long term finance would be provided on marginally more generous terms. Consideration should also be given to raising part of thenon-equity funds (a) from private institutions such as insurance companies and FFI for long term loan capital, and (b) from banks by short term over-draft facilities for working capital (tin addition to the existing overdraft facili-ties which we expect to be maintained).15.21 We suggest that the timing of the additional long term loans shouldbe:Year ended 30th SeptemberFuture needs15.22 On the inflation assumptions explained in paragraph 14.3 of Chapter14 it is forecast that a further  500 million will be needed to finance BL&apos;s requirements between end September 1978 and end September 1982. It is notpossible to foresee the type of financing which will be appropriate for a periodso far ahead but the Government must be prepared to make funds availableeither as loan capital or as a mixture of loan and equity capital.Relationship with progress in improving labour productivity15.23 In Chapter 9 it was stressed that the progress of the new capitalexpenditure programme and the injection of public money into BL should depend, step by step, on evidence of a contribution by the work force to improving BL&apos;s efficiency. It was also explained in Chapter 14 (paragraph14.11) that tin the profit forecast for BL a substantial benefit is being assumed1976 ..s1977 ...1978 ... 100 million 200 million 200 million
from this improvement. The phased nature of the additional funding outlined in the preceding paragraphs of this Chapter will provide some review points to assess whether adequate progress is being made in improving productivity.Following the initial injection of  200 million of equity capital there will bereview points as follows:mud 1976 loan of  100 millionmid 1977 loan of  200 millionmid 1978 loan of  200 millionlate 1978 onwards  500 million in loan or loan/equity in further stages.Legal powers15.24 We recognise that the Government would not be able under thepowers provided by the Industry Aot 1972 to implement the proposals aboutequity capital set out in paragraphs 15.10 to 15.19. Under section 8 of theAct it is not possible either to buy shares from existing shareholders (since thisis not a form of financial assistance to the company) or to acquire more than50 per cent of the equity share capital of a company. However, under theIndustry Bill at present before Parliament the 50 per cent prohibition will beremoved and the National Enterprise Board, when established, will have thepower to purchase shares from existing shareholders. If the Governmentdecides to implement the financing proposals set out in this Chapter, it will clearly wish to give careful consideration to the question of legal powers,bearing in mind the urgent need to make the offer and take up the new equity capital and the possibility that the Industry Bill may not be enacted in time.[Paras 15.25 and 15.26, which contain the Team&apos;s suggestions about the timetable, are omitted.]Summary15.27 The main features of our proposals on the future financing of BL areas follows:(0 A very large part of the additional funds of  900 million which (allow-ing for inflation) BL is likely to require up to end September 1978 willhave to be provided by the Government. ,(ii) There is a strong case on economic grounds for Government finance toput BL on a viable and profitable basis in the longer term.(iii) The Government should be prepared to provide  200 million in equity capital now and up to  500 million in long term loan capital in stagesover the period 1976 to 1978.(iv) The equity capital should be provided by the Governments under-writing of a rights issue to existing shareholders, following a capital reconstruction by a Scheme of Arrangement. It is likely that relatively few shareholders will take up these rights and the Government will therefore be left with most of the new shares.(v) The Scheme of Arrangement should be accompanied by an offer bythe Government to buy out existing shareholders at a price of lOp perexisting share.(vi) BL could, depending on assumptions about inflation, require a further 500 million between end September 1978 and end September 1982and the Government should be prepared to provide funds for this
purpose either as loan capital or in a mixture of loan and equity capital.Before the various tranches of new money are put into BL, thereshould be reviews of the contribution being made by BL&apos;s workers and management to the improvement of productivity and efficiency.
