HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government*75) 67 COPY NO     5813 June 1975CABINETDRAFT TUC STATEMENT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OFTHE SOCIAL CONTRACTNote by the Secretary of State for employment. In my memorandum on the development of the social contract on pay I suggested (C(75) 66, paragraph 19) that we should consider ourposition in the light of the draft TUC statement.    By arrangement withthe General Secretary of the TUC I now circulate in confidence to mycolleagues the attached draft which was considered by the TUC EconomicCommittee on 11 June, and which will be considered further by theGeneral Council on 25 June with a view to deciding, either then or attheir July meeting, on definite recommendations to be put to congress in September.SUMMARY OF DOCUMENT2. Part I relates the social contract to the wider goals of tradeunionism and accepts (paragraphs 8-12) that wage settlements are playinga major part in keeping United Kingdom inflation well above that of our overseas competitors.    Part II reviews the development of all aspectsof the social contract over the past year.    On pay, paragraphs 39-42recognise that there have been undesirable gaps in observance of the payguidelines and stress the need for lower settlements in the next round.3. Part III reviews the economic prospects for the coming year anddiscusses priorities on the Government side of the contract (price control,employment policies, import controls and improvements in the socialwage - paragraphs 50-57).    On pay, it points to the need to get priceinflation down at least to 15 per cent, requiring a major effort to getboth wage and price figures below 20 per cent early in the next wage round(paragraphs 58-61).    It poses, without specifying figures at this stage,various types of option for the General Councils consideration, including:-i.      continuation of the present pay guidelines (paragraph 63);ii.       setting a price inflation target for early next year andadvocating settlements at that level from the beginning of thenext round (paragraph 64);
iii. under i, or ii, fixing a single figure whether in cashterms, as a percentage or a combination of the two(paragraphs 66-69);iv. alternatively, indexation in place of a normal annual increase (paragraph 70).It reaffirms the 12 month rule; continues but qualifies approval of efficiency deals; and indicates that hours reductions would mean lowerpay increases (paragraphs 72-74).4. Part IV emphasises the need for consensus for action within thetrade union movement and reaffirms the role of the TUC in advising keynegotiating groups and others as required, and in keeping the developingsituation under review (paragraphs 75-79).    It makes clear that breaches of the guidelines must not be followed by others (paragraph 80).    it proposes a publicity campaign on the lines successfully organised overthe Industrial Relations Act (paragraph 81) and urges reaffirmation of the contract generally by the Government and by the TUC/Labour PartyMais on Committee (paragraph 82).tuc&apos;s NEXT STEPS5. In a covering letter to the General Council Mr Murray has indicated the TUCls intention to have &quot;exploratory contact&quot; with the CBIand with Ministers before the Council&apos;s meeting 25 June.    There has alsobeen mention of the possibility of further discussion at a special meetingof the Economic Committee.    An approach to Ministers by TUCrepresentatives may therefore be expected within a matter of days, though we understand they will be seeking to meet the CBI first.6. It is uncertain at this stage whether the document will be finalisedfor publication and submission to Congress by the General Council on25 June or at a later meeting.    This will require the Councils decisionon the various forms of pay option and the figure to be specified.    It isunderstood that the rest of the document is also likely to be subject tosome editing, particularly as regards the section on prices, profits,top incomes, employment and investment.recommendation.        My colleagues will wish to consider in the light of this documentthe general approach to the development of the social contract on pay setout in my earlier memorandum.M department of Employment13 June 1975
union the DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOCIAL CONTRACTA document for discussion as a firstbasis for a statement to CongressPART I      THE SOCIAL CONTRACT AND the wider GOALS OF TRADE UNIONISM1      At the time of the last Congress the present government did not have a working majority.    Itobtained that majority in October and few would denythat since that time the programme of legislation hasbeen pressed forward with all possible vigour, despite the continuing critical external economic environment and the deepest recession in the western world sincethe Second World War.New Opportunities for Trade Unionism2      The legislative programme of the Government restslargely on policies formulated in conjunction with the tuc in 1972 and 1973.   The work of the TUC-Labour PartyLiaison Committee has continued since the government took office.3      A central feature of the legislative programme isthe 3-stage programme on industrial relations andjindustrial democracy.   The repeal of the 1971 Act andthe introduction of the Employment Protection Bill arenow being accompanied by the progress on the industry bill and on industrial democracy legislation, which willCONGRESSTRADES
reinforce the standing and function of trade unions and trade unionism at every level, of economic activity.4       The central significance of these developments isthat they make it timely to consider the:wider respon-sibilities,of the trade union movement side by side with these wider opportunities.    This is not to saythat greater involvement in running the economy doesnot need to go further.; the inadequate discussion ofBudget strategy before the 1975 Budget is but animportant example of how the logic of the social con-tract, which is a wider understanding and agreementbetween the trade union movement and the government about the management of the economy among othermatters, needs to be even more fully and adequatelydeveloped.5       To take another example, the wider responsibility which the Government is taking for the financing ofindustry has not yet gone far enough from the. stand-point of many of those directly affected in the  radeunion movement.Here too further trade /union involve-ment is needed in conjunction with Government in the planning of investment and the creation of a wellunderstood set of priorities for national economic development and hence the growth of living standards.The role of collective bargaining in relation,to inyest-ment, company finance, profitability and price;? ;can beseen in a new light as these developments take place.
6      There is as yet insufficient understanding, both within the trade union movement and outside it, of thenew sense of direction which the trade union movement is taking and must take for the future.   Major develop-ments take time to be understood, but those outsidecritics who criticise the social contract for cedingtoo much authority to trade union leaders must appre-associate that this is the only way forward towards reach-ihg agreement on the major economic priorities.7      The coming year will present even greater chal-lenges to the trade union movement and to theGovernment, arid it is of great importance that thereis a full and wide-ranging discussion of the natureof these problems and the reasoning which lies behind the General Council&apos;s continued commitment to thepolicy of the social contract and to its development,which is the policy which they commend to Congress,Why the Social Contract Remains of Central Importance8      There may be some trade unionists who believe thatit is correct and important for the Government to pur-sue the policies outlined in earlier TUC documents, but who do not understand, or believe, that any modificationof wage bargaining approaches is right or necessary.They believe, in other words, that the level of wage&quot;claims and wage settlements can never cause economicdifficulty.
9       The General Council do not accept this.    It is ofcourse true that, in many years, price increases canin no significant way be attributed to. wage increases.Even at the present time, there are many other elements in inflation? there is the stagnation of the economy which means that improvements in efficiency are notable to offset price and cost increases? there is thewave of private sector and public sector price increasessanctioned by recent budgets and adjustments in. theprice code? there is the decision to increase indirect taxation as well as the continued increases in othertaxes including income tax and local rates. . But thefact remains that wages tsoo are at the.present timeplaying a major part in this development.10     It is now generally expected that there will bea major expansion in the world economy within the next12 months.   Britain must be in a position to take full advantage of this.    The difference at present in ratesof price increases is very large, with the UK rate well over 20 per cent and other rates about 10 per cent..One way of closing the gap would be to allow the   todepreciate further and thus equate United Kingdomprices on the world market with those of our majorcompetitors such as the United States, France, Germanyand Japan.11     The consequences of a depreciating   are, however,serious.    It would raise import prices and give a

More immediately,there are now several thousand million pounds of shortterm funds in London which rely to a great extent on security in terms of the relative value of the  .Britain&apos;s short term assets position cannot sustain a major run on these short term liabilities.   This bank-ing fact is no different from that which affects aprivate individual or a great national company such asthe British Leyland Motor Corporation.    112-    The General Council have repeatedly insisted, in discussions with the Government&quot;Ministers involved in economic and industrial issues, that economic manage-ment cannot rely principally on the pay policy aspectsof the social contract.    Investment and the use of resources are of critical importance.   The general council are not satisfied that investment policy has yet been put oh the right lines - though the scale ofthe commitment on BLMC is itself of major importance for the trade union movement:&apos; Nevertheless the general council accept that the relationship between wages and prices is the&apos;cause of considerable and real apprehen-sion--at:&apos;t3ie present time.
FART II     REVIEW OF THE PAST YEAR1974 Congress15       The 197^ Congress overwhelmingly adopted the GeneralCouncilTs report &quot;Collective Bargaining and the social contract&quot; and two composite motions which both .rejected a statutory wages policy.    The report set out the achievementsof the Labour Government and, under the heading of therestoration of voluntary collective bargaining, the TUCguidelines to negotiators.   The main points of the guidelineswe&apos;re the maintenance of real incomes, a twelve-month interval between major increases, the encouragement of agreementshaving beneficial effects on unit costs, efficiency and jobsecurity, and agreements to secure reasonable minimum standardssuch as the TUC low pay target, progress towards four weeksholiday, the elimination of discrimination against women,and full use of the Advisory Conciliation and ArbitrationService.&apos;14      Composite 9 expressed full support for the policies ofthe TUC and the Government which form the social contract;and Composite 10, while recognising the positive steps takenby the Government, drew attention to some public sector payproblems.    The General Council also agreed to pursue points in a motion which was withdrawn.   The eight points were:    alarge-scale redistribution of income and wealth;   a massiveincrease in housebuilding with the emphasis on homes for thosein need and those on lower incomes;    municipalisation of rentedproperty;    public ownership of the land required for thehousing programme;    a wide-ranging and permanent system of price control;    vastly improved social services by theinjection of the necessary resources;    substantial increases in public ownership and public enterprise, coupled with
public supervision&apos;of the investment policies of largeprivate corporationsj    and substantial cuts in defen-ee -.....expenditure in order to releas/e resources to help carry through this programme.Developments since Congress15       During the past year the General Council have had thedevelopment of the social contract under continual and closereview.    Following the Chancellor&apos;s November Budget theGeneral Council issued a circular to all affiliated unions.They said that &quot;the Chancellor has acted in his Budget to expand the economy in Britain.    Although the measures havenot been as wide-ranging as the General Council would have wished, they can be seen as a courageous endeavour toprotect employment,  stimulate investment and promote socialjustice.    But unless new methods of giving selective help to industry, accountable to the Government, are speedily developed,the momentum of the Budget will be lost.    Particular industries,such as construction and building materials, are in difficulties and the General Council will wish to discuss with the Government the growth of public expenditure and priorities within it, such as housing, education and social services&quot;.16      Though stressing that it was not the purpose of the circular to reiterate every point in &quot;Collective Bargainingand the Social Contract&quot;,    the General Council reminded unionsof some of the .TUC guidelines, with particular respect tothreshold agreements, the 12-month interval between principalsettlements, and low pay.    They reaffirmed the central realincome maintenance guideline, while pointing out that it would.be far better if we could gradually get prices to rise more      islowly, with money wages correspondingly not going up so fast,
&quot; 2.3than to have prices and wages equating with each other at ahigher and higher level.    Any such tendency,  they emphasised,would inevitably be self-defeating for most trade unionists.1975 TUC Economic Review17       The 1975 TUC Economic Review had as its theme themaintenance of real incomes and employment.    Arguing againsta statutory wages policy or one which would lead to cuts in living standards, the General Council nevertheless pointedout that a general attempt to secure increases greater thanthe rise in the cost of living would be self-defeating andcontribute to inflationary pressures.   They argued that the dual, objectives of maintaining real incomes and employmentlevels are indeed interdependent.    The Review stressed that itwas a highly desirable objective of policy that the rate of price increases should now begin to fall, pointing out thatthreshold agreements, where payment is made as and when theparticular price increases occur, can insure against anI!acceleration of inflation.18 1    As^usual the Review contained the General Council&apos;budget recommendations to the Chancellor of the &quot;-Exchequerand all the points mentioned in the withdrawn Congress motion werepursued along with other General Council policies.    In theEconomic Review special attention was given,to investment bythe not-and other nationalised industries,, housing, land and construction, the need for increased subsidies and .more effective price control and social priorities.May Circular19 Following the April 1975 Budget the General Councilissued a further statement arguing that there was nothing in the present situation that reduced the need for the social
contract,-, or the need to reach agreements on the basis of theguidelines.    The TUC guidelines had been voluntarily endorsed by Congress and it was right that they should be voluntarilyupheld, and observed closely and carefully.    The general council argued that the aim should be to realise the prospectof bringing the level of price inflation substantially below20 per cent by the end of the year.The Progress of the Labour Government20      Over the past year the General Council have metrepresentatives of the Labour Party regularly in the TUC -Labour Party Liaison Committee to discuss developments inthe economic and   industrial situation and other matters.    -Close contact has been maintained with individual ministers by sub-committees of the General Council and TUC industrialcommittees.    The social contract has involved a good workingrelationship between the TUC and the Government on a wide range of economic, industrial and social issues.ii21       The General Council have kept in close touch bothinformally and formally with those affiliated unions whichhave encountered difficulties in conforming with the spiritof the TUC guidelines.22       In their report to the 197^ Congress the General Councilset out the achievements of the Labour Government in the first six months.of office.    The momentum of those first six months has been maintained.   The General Council have registeredtheir dissent from some aspects of the April Budget,particularly those which will affect prices and unemployment.Even so, the Movement should acknowledge the many steps taken .by the Government in accordance with their undertakings.    The  government have repeatedly made plain their rejection of the
notion that statutory control of wages could provide a justor practical answer to the nation&apos;s economic problems.    trade unionists welcome this endorsement of their own strongly-heldview that there is no viable alternative to a continuation of voluntary collective bargaining.New Rights for Workpeople2j5       The Trade Union and Labour Relations Act will sweep awaythe last remaining vestiges of the Industrial Relations Act,so completing the first stage of the Labour Party&apos;s programme in this field.   The Employment Protection Bill, which willestablish a new range of legal rights for workpeople andfoster the development  of collective bargaining is progressingthrough the House of Commons and is expected to be on theStatute Book before Parliament rises for the Summer recess.The Bill will establish by statute the Advisory Conciliation and arbitration Service, which has already more than /fulfilled itsexpectations as a means of solving disputes.Training and Health and Safety24       The General Council welcomed the^ extra funds allocated inthe Budget to the Manpower Services Commission andyi through their representatives on the MSC, they will be pressing fora continued expansion of industrial training and for the MSCto develop job creation schemes itself.    The General Council&apos;representatives have also been playing an active role on the health and Safety Commission and are pressing for the imple-mentation of the statutory system of union, safety representativeprovided for in the Health and Safety at Work Act.Public Ownership and Accountability in Industry25      The problems of British industry are structural and
medium term, and their solution requires not blanket fiscalmeasures, but detailed planning with trade union involvement.An organisation committee for the National Enterprise board with strong trade union representation has already beenestablished, and when the Industry Bill reaches the statute book it will have a  1 billion financial backing from theGovernment.    The new industry legislation contains legalback up powers on the disclosure of information, and theGeneral Council are looking for speedy progress in the formu-lation of planning agreements between trade unions, management and Government, in all the major firms in UK industry.    TheNEB will have regional responsibilities, including NorthernIreland, and in Scotland and Wales new Development Agenciesare to be set up.    The Government has already demonstrated its willingness to use existing powers to protect jobs andindustrial capacity in the past few months of economic recession,as exemplified by their action to put British Leyland andFerranti on a sounder economic footing with a public sectorstake.    Special help for industrial investment was promised inthe Budget and funds will be made available for the reorganisa-tion of the ferrous foundries industry following tripartite -talks at the industry&apos;s newly formed Economic development committee.    Help has als^ been promised for the textile industry,though the General Council take the view that more vigoroushelp is needed and could be given by means of import controls.26      Legislation to bring the shipbuilding and aircraft industries into public ownership has been introduced in line  Iwith the preparatory-work carried out by- joint TUC/CSEU/LabourParty working groups.27       In the key energy sector,  the Government has given a clear commitment to the target of 150 million tons, of . coal ...... jproduction.    After a period of procrastination by the   previous !
31 Between 1973-74 and 1974-75 the social wage increasedby over 30 per cent, from  11.50 a week per head of theGovernment a type of nuclear reactor has been chosen whichwill create the maximum amount of employment in the UK.tt the sites for the construction of oil production rigs and platformsare being brought under public control.    Legislation is being introduced to redress the balance between the Government andthe multi-national oil companies and the British National OilCorporation should be developed as quickly as possible as a fully fledged publicly-owned oil company.    Although the rateof the Petroleum Revenue Tax will prove overgenerous for thevery profitable oil fields, the tax receipts from North Seaoil will be in the  2- 3 billion range by 1980.28      In the transport field the General Council have welcomed the progress made towards extending the dock labour schemeand the reorganisation of British ports which will extendpublic ownership and planning.29    . In construction tougher tax measures to deal with theabuses of the lump have been announced and long overduelegislation is shortly to be introduced which will set upa register of approved sub-contractors and a construction industry Manpower Board to monitor progress and lead towardsthe decasualisation of the industry,30      The Community Land Bill, now progressing through parliament, will take development land into public ownership and, together with the proposed Development Land Tax, it will put an end to the speculative profits that have unfairly beenmade out of the granting of planning permission.The,Social Wage
Redistribution of Income and Wealth34      The increase in the social wage, financed throughworking population to  15 on the basis of current expenditure,or from  14.20 a week to  19 a week if capital expenditure onsuch projects as new hospitals and schools is included.32      The concept of the social wage is a recognition of thefact that personal consumption is not financed entirely outof take-home pay.    In fact for every  4 of personal spendingfinanced privately  1 of spending is financed by the Government.One of the first actions of the Labour Government was toincrease old age pensions to the  10 and  16 level agreed byiCongress and this has been followed by an increase in Aprilthis year with a further increase payable in December 1975*Family allowances have been increased and through the childbenefit scheme will be payable for the first child in 1977*increased family allowances will be payable for all children of one parent families from April 1976.   Many of the cutsimposed by the previous Government on the education and health services have been restored and a substantial increase hasbeen made in housing expenditure.   Rents were frozen for theifirst year of the Labour Government&apos;s office and the new housing Rents and Subsidies Act repeals the Housing Finance Actand allows local authorities &apos;to.:assess rents on a fairer basis.Between 1973-74 and 1974-75 there was a 32 per cent increasein Government expenditure on housing.1133      The General Council welcome the Governments commitment to meet priorities such as pensions and housing and their action to increase the social wage. The real increase in the-social wage, concentrated as it is in areas such as housing and pensions, has had an important effect in redistributing income and in giving disadvantaged groups better living.standards......
- 2.9       vtaxation,-&apos;is&quot; a potent means of redistributing income in oursociety.   The&apos; General Council recognise that this increasemust involve increases in taxation, particularly when output is not rising.    Their criticism of some of the April 1975Budget measures was not that a 25 per cent VAT rate on less essential goods is unfair, but that it was not accompanied by increased subsidies for essential goods and services. The incometax system has been made fairer by increases in personalallowances, and higher rates on unearned incomes.   Many taxloopholes have been closed, though a continuing effort is neededhere.    The capital transfer tax on all major transfers of wealth from the 197 4- Spring Budget onwards has been introduced.This will put an end to the death duty system and its abuses, aswell as&apos; bring other forms of capital transfer into the tax system.    Government plans for a wealth tax are being studied by a Parliamentary Committee and legislation is expected in the1976 Budget.    The Royal Commission on the Distribution of income and Wealth has completed the first three of its reports on the standing reference on the distribution of income andwealthj    income from companiesj    and higher incomes   - and the General Council look to the Government to take full accountof the Commissions recommendations for improving the&quot;distribution of income and wealth in formulating its fiscaland other policies.Economic Situation in the Past Year35 The General Council do not wish to minimise the seriousness of the present economic situation. On the otherhand they would emphasise that in some respects the economicsituation has improved substantially since March 1974- and itis right to draw attention to these improvements. There hasin particular been a substantial improvement in the balance of
payments.    In 197 ^ the current account deficit was running at about  900 million a quarter:   by.the first quarter of 1975the deficit was down to  325 million.    The current balance ingoods and services, other than petroleum and petroleum productshas turned from a deficit of  450 million a quarter in 197^to a surplus of  100 million in the first quarter of 1975.(The April current account deficit was  170 million which was more than accounted for by the deficit of  213 millions onpetroleum and petroleum products).36      Nevertheless certain features cause continuing concern,in particular the slow growth in output.   Both the July 197^and November 197^ measures were reflationary, injecting about 1,000 million in real demand terms,, though the effect of these measures will not be felt until 1975/76.   The April 1975 Budgetwas deflationary and will take about  300 million out of the economy in the. coming year.    There has been a decline in industrial production in recent months and the index in thefirst quarter of 1975 is.some 4^ per cent below the index in   -the first quarter of 1973-37      This recession, which has hit all industrial countries to some degree or. other   -   Britain less than most   .T.   has led.to a disturbing increase in unemployment.   By mid-May theseasonally-adjusted figure for unemployment (excluding school-leavers) stood at 817,000 or 3.6 per cent, a 56,800 jump onthe previous month.   Unfilled vacancies in mid-May were downto 156,000 and the latest estimate of those on short time is250,000. -38      The rate of price inflation has increased in the past yeaand is currently running at over ,20 per cent.    The. increase inprices since 1970 was initially the result of increases in theprice of imported commodities, and the more recent increase in
oil prices accelerated this process.    The position has beenmade worse by the continued depreciation of the pound.Undoubtedly the movement of wages over the second half oflast year was partly a reaction to the rapid rise in prices.However, the higher rate of wage increases, together with thebunching of threshold payments,  itself exerted an upward pushon prices, which was not offset by the moderation in import .prices.    The failure of production to grow meant that thewhole of the increases were passed on, without savings, in costs per unit.Review of the Pay Round39      Following the restoration of voluntary collective bargaining a number of increases recognised as special cases were made in the public sector to deal with longstandinginjustices and manpower difficulties stemming from statutory ,controls.   These included special reviews of nurses&apos; and teachers&apos; payj    postment and transport workers also receivedspecial increases.    In the private sector there were a numberof similar settlements in the period immediately following the end of statutory controls aimed at rectifying problems arising from Stage 3.    This bargaining situation was complicated by Stage 3 thresholds which triggered a number of times duringthe period.^0      Eater   in &apos; :1974     long-overdue improvements in the region of 30 per cent were made in the pay of local authority manual workers and NHS ancillaries to bring minimum rates into line with the TUC&apos;s low pay target of  30.   However, these increases were used as abasis for &quot;comparability&quot; increases in other parts of the public sector beyond the low pay targetlevel,-    and the miners&apos; settlement of over 30 per cent in theearly part of 1975 had repercussions in electricity supply and
2.12   .elsewhere.    In the meantime civil servants received asubstantial increase under PRU procedures.4l      The result was a general level of settlements signifi-cantly above the guidelines endorsed by Congress, although,if recognised special elements are excluded, the underlyingrate of increase in wages has been closer to the index of retail prices than is suggested by much uninformed comment.The General Council also wish to acknowledge the real leader-ship given by many negotiators even if, under pressure fromtheir membership, and sometimes in response to offers by employers, they have ultimately had to settle at levels whichcould not be justified by the guidelines.42      Nevertheless, there have clearly been undesirable gapsin the observance of the guidelines, and if settlements inthe next round of negotiations are pitched at the level ofsome of those negotiated recently, or if new settlements aremade before their due date, the prospect of reducing priceinflation towards the end of this year and during next year.will be seriously threatened.
3.part III - THE COMING YEAR43f    It is against the background of the past year&apos;experience that the General Council how review theprospects for the coming year, including priorities forthe Labour Government and the TUC &apos;s guidance tonegotiators. - &apos;--;-?-v-Economic Prospects44     Following the period of recent slow growth the economy will still be growing very slowly in the comingperiod.   The Treasury forecast is that between thesecond half of 1975 and the first half of 1976 the realgrowth in the economy will only be 1.0 per cent at anannual rate, which is far below the productive potentialities-tial of the economy.  ,45     World trade is expected to pick up in 1976, andpossibly around the end of 1975, and -this should givea welcome boost to UK exports and so help increaseemployment.    But UK exports could become uncompetitiveif inflation is not brought closer to the OECD averagewhich is forecast by the end of the year to be only 10or 11 per cent.46    The Chancellor has forecast that inthe second half of the year the rate of increase in prices woulddecelerate month by month to some 12-16 per cent atannual rates.   This however will mean that the year on
year figures for the months at&quot;--the end of 1975 willstillo.be over 20 per cent.    The aim should be to-bringthe rate of inflation substantially below this with &quot;a continuing fall during 1976.   The General Cbuncil--believe. that this prospect will be threatened if : --settlements in the next round of negotiations are;pitched at the level of some of those negotiatedrecently, or if new settlements are made&apos;before theirdue date .- &apos;47     The General Council would have preferred to see -: the economy growing.at a faster rate than at presentand will continue to press the Government to adopt :15measures.to ensure this? a slackening of the rate of wage increases would greatly strengthen their ability,and the Governments willingness, to secure this major policy objective.   The present slow growth of the economy however leaves no scope for increases in realwages, given the need to finance increases in thesocial wage advocated by unions.   Most of the growth of consumption in real terms will be accounted for bygroups such as pensioners, one parent families and large families supported by low wages.Investment, Planning Agreements and Industrial Democracy48     Despite the public expenditure cuts which have been announced for 1976-77 public investment:-is forecast to grow by 2 per cent between the first ;half of 1975 and
the first half of 1976,,    On the other hand privatefixed investment is forecast to decline by 4 per cent.The continuing fall in private fixed investment under-lines the urgency of the new industrial legislation which the Government is introducing.49     The General council hope that the fullest usewill be made of the new industrial powers presently .being legislated for, and the negotiation of planning agreements with major companies will be a priority.In this context progress in establishing a national planning Centre would help bring together trade union representatives, managers and civil servants to study the best methods of implementing planning agreements and improving the performance of British industries.The nationalisation legislation for shipbuilding, air-craft and the BNOC should proceed as quickly aspossible, and there will be a need to extend public ownership through the not.   Major legislation on industrial democracy, based on trade union organisa-tion, is a further key priority for the next year inorder to extend the concept of joint planning andcontrol to all the levels of the economy.Priorities for the Labour GovernmentPrices50     The General Council welcomed the fact that the .Prices Secretary, in her major autumn review of the
price code, resisted the many demands from industrialiststhat the price code should be abolished.    nevertheless the General Council are concerned that not enough isbeing done to control prices or win public confidence inthe present system.51     In particular, an intensified effort needs to bemade at shop level, through the publication of pricelists, unit prices and price range orders, which canall help the shopper.    Over the past year the TUC hasbeen encouraging trades councils to press their localauthorities to set up high street consumer advicecentres.   Trades councils have been actively pursuingthis, but on many occasions local authorities havereplied that they have insufficient funds to set upsuch centres.    Only a small injection of centralGovernment money, perhaps  1 million, to help localauthorities set up these centres could reap very sub-stantial rewards in terms of public confidence in theprice control system.52     The role of subsidies also needs to be examined further, and the present food subsidies have had avery marked effect in helping the low paid and the pensioners.    The General Council are pressing theGovernment to review its decision to cut expenditureon food subsidies, not least to avoid increases inprices matched by higher wages.   Here again, an abate-ment in the rate of wage increases would greatly
Employment54     On present trends the level of unemployment maywell reach the one million mark before the end of19757 arid rise even more through the coming winter.It1 Is therefore vital that the fastest possible pro-gress is made in Introducing the Temporary EmploymentSubsidy, in the administration of which trade unionistsshould play a part.   The Manpower Services commission will have an increasingly important role and it shouldbe encouraged to develop job creation schemes.55     In a period of high unemployment tlie Governmentshould improve the operation of the various national insurance and supplementary benefit rules, and remove the unfairness with which the existing rules operate against those on short time working.Import Controls56     Despite the welcome improvement in the balanceof payments the level of imports, particularly ofstrengthen the General Council1s efforts.53   The General Council recognise that the Governmenthas made great efforts to&quot;Introduce a comprehensive1system of price control&apos;.   An extra effort at thepresent time, including greater publicity, would bewell worthwhile.
sensitive manufactures, is still causing.concern.   Theimportation of certain goods such as textiles, clothing,footwear, glass, electronics and motor.cars is having aserious effect on employment levels in the UK.    Evidenceof dumping of some of these commodities is clear and theGovernment should not hesitate to act in these cases.There is also a case for introducing more widespreadimport controls on manufactured goods as a temporary measure until the economy begins to expand again. ,The Social Wage57     The General Council will be looking for further improvements in the social wage through more regularreviews of pensions and other national insurance benefits, and to meet particular needs such as extrahelp for the disabled, a generous level of child benefits, and educational priorities such as nurseryschool provision, day release and adult education.Defence cuts have already been announced which will help allow increases in the social wage within total public expenditure, but more should be done in thisconnection, whilst bearing in mind the employmentimplications.Pay Guidance58     If the UK is going to take advantage of the.comingincrease in world trade, so boosting exports and jobs,UK produced goods have to be competitive.    Given the
average rate of inflation in other OECD countries, .,par-ticularly Germany,, we must get down at least to 15 percent if we are to remain at all competitive.59     The 15 per cent target, is not an impossible onebut it will mean that in the coming year there will.,,,have to be a turning point after which the rate of inflation will continue to. fall.60     It is in this context that negotiators should bear in mind the central TUC guideline - the mainte-nance of real incomes.   The problem is how to ensurethat rises in incomes match a level of, eg, 10 or 15,per cent price rise, rather than a level of 20 or 25per cent price rise.    The external position of the economy means that there is an overwhelming need forthe equation to be at the lower end of the rangerather than the higher end.    * . P61     This means that a major effort has to be made toget the wage and price figures below 20 per cent earlyin the next wage round.   This will be very, difficult;-:to achieve, and indeed impossible in the short run, ifthe present rate of rise in prices is taken as thebasis of a wage guideline figure for the whole of thenext pay round.    If the present rate of wage increasesis taken as the basis for settlements in the next roundit will be impossible to avoid an even more dangerousinflationary spiral.
.   62     There are therefore two&apos; broad options for the&apos;General Council to. consider, and these options could take a number of different forms63     The first option is to continue the present payguidelines - ie, matching rises in &quot;the cost Of living.This approach has:-the major advantage that it is wdllunderstood and has a relatively small effect on wagestructures.    It would however, at best, slow down therate of progress to lower prices.64    A more stringent approach would be for theGeneral Council to set as a target the achievement ofa particular rate of price increase by early nextyear? and advocate settlements at that level from thebeginning of the next round, which would mean theacceptance of settlements significantly below thegoing rate of increase in prices.    It has to berecognised that if any group of workers was to accepta wage settlement below the current level of price increases in order to assist in a deceleration ofprices; &quot;to the level of their settlement they would atthe very minimum need to be sure that all othersucceeding groups of workers would do the same.    Theywould also need some assurance that, in the event ofprices rising more than their settlement they wouldbe able to-recoup-in future (either by way of thresholds- though those have caused serious problems in the lastyear - or at the next settlement).
65     Either of these options could be pursued in a ^number of. different ways - and indeed the different&apos;ways would themselves in some.:respects be considered as further options.66     In either case a single cash figure could replacewhatever percentage figure (whether the going price-rise figure or a target price-rise figure) implicit inthe relevant option.67    A single cash figure would have the advantages of being easy to understand, providing greater cashincreases for lower paid workers and preventing highcash increases for the higher paid.  iAt the same time,however, it would disturb differentials based on skill and responsibility and fail to maintain real incomesfor all above a certain level.   A single cash figurecould therefore be divisive and lead to opposition?and partly.because of this there would be a tendency for the cash increases for the lower paid to begeneralised in percentage terms &apos;to other groups.68    A single percentage figure could be combined witha low pay target minimum, and possibly with a limit on higher pay, in order to at least mitigate any adversedistributive effects compared with a cash figure.69 . A. further possibility would be to combine the cashand percentage approaches, eg,  X+Y per cent.   This
could share the benefits of both approaches; the cashfigure could ensure higher percentages for the low paid, while the:percentage figure provided some pro-tection for those above a certain income.    The &quot;per-centage&quot; element would have to be well short of thefull cost of living in order&apos; to provide for the &quot;cash&quot;element.70    A different type of variant would be completeindexation, either on a monthly or a quarterly basis,forgoing any normal -annual increase.    (A variation ofthis would be to include a second element on whichannual negotiations&quot;could be&quot;based, involving such factors as the value of&quot; the work involved, possibly on a job evaluation basis.)&apos; Against indexing, however,it is clear that unions do wish to negotiate &quot;annualimprovements, and the addition of - further elements on top of indexing would conflict with the central objec-tive of maintaining - but not improving - real incomes,and provide a higher floor of wages and prices fromwhich to begin the process of reducing inflation.71     Clearly there are difficulties with-all theseapproaches.   Recommending a specific formula may,depending on the formula chosen, add to clarity.    Butthe danger is that this will be at the expense of reducing the flexibility for negotiators in relationto their own negotiating circumstances and traditions.
Twelve Month Rule72     The twelve month rule for major.increases will need to be retained; and settlements will still need to take account of any interim increases includingthresholds, although this is likely to be less of a problem as the complication of existing Stage 3thresholds is progressively reduced over the rest of1975.Efficiency73     Improved arrangements for job security is aprerequisite for the introduction of new techniquesin this period of difficulties.    Priority shouldcontinue to be given to these arrangements and toagreements which will have beneficial effects onunit costs and efficiency.    However, in this periodunions will need to give serious consideration tothe need to avoid repercussions on other groups,and to the possibility of &quot;phasing&quot; increases.   Anyspecial improvements of this nature which are agreed should not be used as a basis for comparabilityclaims.Hours of Work74     In the current situation there may be understand-able pressure for work-sharing arrangements.   To be effective these must take the form of a cut in actualhours worked per employee.   They should not be used as
a method of obtaining a disguised increase in real&apos;incomes out of line with the general guidelines.Negotiators should therefore give priority to secur-ing actual reductions in hours, and to reducingnormal hours to 40 in sectors where this has not been attained.&quot;   The 35 hour week remains a longer term objective)&quot; but in&apos;view of the wider needs and priorities of the time there cannot be a general move to 35 hours this year without specific offsets in theform of lower pay increases.
4.1IV   II4PLEMBNTING THE CONTRACT75     It is not sufficient for the trade union movementat Congress to give formal endorsement to a report ofthis kind.76    Whatever formula is adopted will be meaningless -perhaps worse - if it is not carried into effect insettlements.   In some ways the formula itself is less important than winning its acceptance by members andtheir negotiators.   There is therefore still a majorjob for everyone to do in ensuring that this under-standing is disseminated&apos;to the ten million trade unionists.   Ultimately/ the narrow wage and salaryaspects will only be seen in their perspective by the mass.;.of trade union membership if they too havecomprehended what it is that the trade union movement is endeavouring to achieve.   There must be a far greater,degree of association in the future betweentrade unionists themselves and the Congress position.There has to be an identification and a commitment tothe action to follow.77     Many trade union leaders themselves may unwittinglygive the impression that the social contract is something which concerns the Government and something which con-cerns the TUC but does not concern and involve thempersonally.   There can be no failure of the social contract if there is an identification by trade unionists
themselves, and.by all members of the Government aswell.   But failure is inevitable if trade union mem-bers do not feel this sense of identification and association.   Without the understanding, support,commitment and action on the part of trade union members, the TUC can achieve little.Establishing a Consensus for Action78     As far as unions are concerned, the object shouldbe to secure acceptance and involvement at all stagesvia the normal processes of policy formulation -branch discussions, conference debates and pre-      r &quot;negotiation meetings.    It is intended that this policystatement on the development of the social contractshould be given the fullest possible circulation to,and discussion within, trade unions down to branchand shop-floor level, prior toT full discussion at the ;September Congress,   union policies on collective bar-gaining should be formulated in.the light of this      ^ :statement and of branch discussions: on-it.79     The TUC will continue to hold panel meetings withcertain key negotiating groups on the. basis of a time- &apos;table drawn up sufficiently in advance. ;of negotiations to enable effective discussions at an early stage inunion claim formulation.   More generally, the general council will ,continue, ,tp^expect, unions, in^ difficulties1in conforming to;the, spirit of the policy to inform the
General Council of the circumstances and seek theiradyice? or to. respond to an invitation to discuss thesituation with them.    The General Council will beprepared to meet any group which requests such ameeting and to provide what advice and support theycan give to groups which are experiencing difficul-ties in attaining the policy objectives.    the developing situation will be kept under review and ifnecessary a special conference of union executives ^will be convened at an appropriate stage in the round to review the operation of the policy as a whole.80     It will be made clear that particular settlements in excess of the Congress guidelines are outsideCongress policy and must not be followed by other groups.81     There will be more accent on publicity to getthe message across to the membership on the shop-floorand to the general public, in the form of massive pub-publicity for a summary - making full use of &quot;Labour&quot;and union journals and as far as possible taking the campaign kit on the Industrial Relations Act as a guide.82     The Government too must reaffirm its commitment to its side of the contract -- on employment, on prices,on the redistribution of incomes and wealth, on public
DL/CC/BC/EJune 4 1975ownership, on industrial democracy, oh housing and land, and on the social wage.   The Liaison Committeewill be asked to underline this, and to;keep progressunder continuous review.
