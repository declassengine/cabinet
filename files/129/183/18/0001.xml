IjIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 6816 June 1975CABINETINDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACYMemorandum by the Lord ChancellorINTRODUCTION1.        At their meeting on 15 May the Cabinet invited me to arrange fora group of Ministers to consider the proposal for an external committeeof inquiry into employee participation on company boards.    The groupwere to look in particular at whether there should be such an inquiry,what form it should take and its terms of reference; they were to take account of the repercussions on the nationalised industries of employeerepresentation on the boards of companies in the private sector.    Wehave held two meetings to consider these matters and our conclusions are presented to the Cabinet in this memorandum.VIEWS ON THE MAIN QUESTIONir2. The terms of reference for the inquiry proposed by the Secretaryof State for Trade were -&quot;1.    Accepting the need for a radical extension of democracythrough employee participation in the control of companies bymeans of representation on the boards of directors, and theessential role of trade union organisations in this process, toconsider what form this might take, taking into account theproposals in the Trades Union Congress (TUC) report on&quot;Industrial,Democracy&quot; as well as other current proposals and experience in Britain and other countries.2.    Having regard to the interests of the national economy,employees, investors and consumers, to analyse the implications of different schemes for such representation forthe efficient management of companies and for company law. &quot;Although these terms of reference recognised the importance of tradesunion organisation in this context and highlighted the TUC Report, theydid not meet the TUC request to include a statement that the extension ofindustrial democracy must be based on the trades union organisation.copy NOr
3. It emerged clearly from our discussions that there was a deeply-held difference of opinion on the question whether there should be anexternal committee of inquiry, and although a numerical majoritypreferred an internal inquiry followed by a Green Paper, I thought itwise not to make a final decision but to give the Cabinet ministers concerned an opportunity of re-stating their views to the Cabinet onthis main issue.4. The arguments in support of each type of inquiry may be summarisedas follows -a. FOR AN EXTERNAL INQUIRYThe TUC have set their sights on the co-direction of industry by workers and management, and the means proposed for achieving this is the appointment of trades union representatives to50 per cent of the places on the boards of private companies.Such a proposition has far-reaching consequences and will certainly be -yigorouoly opposed by those who do not agree withthe TUC.   It would therefore be prudent to attempt somereconciliation of the opposing views by means of an independentexternal inquiry before the Government decide what action totake to give effect to our commitment to extend industrial democracy.    Even if the recommendations of an external inquiryare not unanimous, its report would set out the arguments for and against different courses of action so that these can be weighed bythe public and by Parliament.    The decision which we eventuallymake on how to proceed would therefore stand a better chance ofbeing accepted since it would be seen to be based on some measureof public consensus.    Sooner or later we shall have to face apublic debate on how we should proceed, and it would be better ifthis debate were to be based upon an unbiased assessment of thevarious possible courses of action which an independent externalcommittee of inquiry would provide.    Moreover, the chances of bringing opposing views together would be improved if publicattitudes could be formed on the basis of an impartial review byan independent body.b. FOR AN INTERNAL INQUIRYWhatever they may have said in public, the TUC are by no meansof one mind on the question of trades union representation on the boards of private companies, and Congress have only recentlybeen converted to the view that there should be 50 per cent workerrepresentation on company boards.    Some unions argue thatworker participation in management decisions at board level would be a compromise with the capitalist system; and othersclaim that the traditional independence of the trades union movement and its ultimate responsibility to its members would be2
undermined by participation in board level decisions.    Theirpreference is for strengthening collective bargaining.    Whenthe trades union movement is itself so divided over the issuesat stake, it would not serve any useful purpose to appoint anindependent committee to examine the different courses of action that might be pursued.    What is required is an internal inquiryby officials to explore the questions of company law which willhave to be settled before any proposals can be put into effect.When views held by the different parties concerned are so widelyat variance,  the final choice on what must be done will have torest with the Government, and the sooner we get on with it the better.    There are two other points in favour of an internalinquiry which are not balanced by opposing arguments pointingto an external inquiry.    First,  there is the virtual impossibility of persuading the TUC to accept terms of reference for anindependent inquiry which do not meet with the approval of congress.    An inquiry which does not have their co-operationmust start at a serious disadvantage.    Secondly, there is thequestion of Mr Radice!s Industrial Democracy Bill which is dueto receive its third reading in the House of Commoagon 11 July.    There is a real possibility that Mr Radice may be persuaded to withdraw his Bill if we make a forthcoming statementbefore that date about our own proposals for ps**omoting industrial democracy.    A decision to appoint an external inquiry with termsof reference which do not find favour with the TUC wouldprobably not be sufficient to persuade Mr Radice to withdraw hisBill.For my own part I am bound to say that I find the arguments in favourof an external committee of inquiry most persuasive.   A crucial question is whether the TUC would be prepared to take part in the inquiryon terms of reference which fall short of TUC expectations.    TheSecretary of State for Trade thinks they would.    The Secretary of Statefor Employment thinks they would not.    li they would not it seemspointless to proceed in this direction.    We should in those circumstancesadopt the alternative of an internal inquiry.OTHER RELATED MATTERS5. Though we have not been able to reach a decision on the main issue, we have come to conclusions on a number of related matters.These conclusions need not be disturbed whatever decision the Cabinettakes on the form of the inquiry which should be set up to consideremployee participation in the private sector.a.      NATIONALISED INDUSTRIESFurther work and consultation is required before any decision can be taken about how the concepts of industrial democracycan be applied at board level in the nationalised industries.The relationship between the Government and the nationalised3
industries is one aspect of the study which the national economic Development Office (NEDO) have been asked toundertake; but there may have to be further interdepartmentalexamination of the specific problems raised by employeerepresentation and the boards of statutory corporations.    Thecase for an internal inquiry here is much more clear-cut sinceMinisters themselves have statutory responsibilities for the nationalised industries and the right of appointment of board members.    We therefore recommend that there should be an internal study by officials of the various options.b. CONTINUATION OF LIMITED EXPERIMENTSExperiments are already taking place or being planned onworker representation at board level.    The main examples are Harland and Wolff, Meriden and the Scottish Daily News(all with support from public funds); but others may be initiated by the National Enterprise Board which will have the specific duty to promote industrial democracy in the under-takings it controls.    The Government should give every encouragement to such experiments.    We recommend that theseexperiments should continue for the time being and that account should be taken of any lessons to be learned before theGovernment draw up their own proposals.c. COMMITMENT TO LEGISLATION IN 1976-77It is very important that the Government should give a firmundertaking to introduce legislation on industrial democracyin the Parliamentary Session 1976-77, and we recommend thatan early statement should be made to this effect.    this statement should be made before 11 July when Mr RadicelsIndustrial Democracy Bill is due to receive its third reading in the House of Commons, with the aim of persuading him towithdraw his Bill.    On the assumption that the GovernmenfsBill would be introduced early in 1977, the preparation of aBill would need to be put in hand by the autumn of 1976.    Thiswould give just over a year for an inquiry to be conducted.THE GROUP&apos;s conclusions.        Whatever is decided on the question whether there should be an internal or an external inquiry, I invite the Cabinet to agree that -a. there should be a separate, internal inquiry to consider how industrial democracy should be promoted at board levelin the nationalised industries;b. experiments on industrial democracy presently takingplace should continue;4
c.      the Government should give a firm undertaking(before 11 July) to introduce legislation in 1976-77.7.        I invite the Cabinet to decide whether -a. $here should be an external inquiry as proposed by theSecretary of State for Trade with the terms of reference setout in paragraph 2 above; orb. i.       there should be an internal inquiry by officials,followed byii.       the publication of a Green Paper which would be a comprehensive statement of the Government&apos;s provisionalviews about worker representation on boards and on ways of promoting industrial democracy below board level.The Green Paper would cover both the private and publicsectors and would describe the existing opportunities forworker participation, the further advances which would flow from the Employment Protection Bill and theIndustry Bill when enacted and the experiments already taking place, such as that at Harland and Wolff.    It wouldalso outline the possible avenues of further advance,including those advocated by the TUC.    Such a publication would provide a basis for the discussion of the issues involved before the drafting of legislation was put in hand.nE lord Chancellor^ Department16 June 19755
