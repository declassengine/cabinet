A note by officials is attached.L J foreign and Commonwealth Office18 April 1975
SECRETAnnexNOTE BY officials.     Under Article 93.3 of the e.c. Treaty there is an obligationto inform the Commission of any plans to grant or alter aids to industry.    In December 1974 the Commission was notified of theproposal to guarantee an increase in BLMC&apos;s overdraft.    Theywere told that this was an interim measure to sustain thecompany while support for its investment programme was considered and that details of this longer term scheme would be notified indue course.    We took the line that this assistance to a company with a focal position in the economy was justifiable under Article92.3(c) of the e.c. Treaty and that it would not adversely affecttrading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest.The Commission raised no difficulty but asked for as long aspossible advance notice of the longer term proposals and suggestedthat problems would be reduced if any aids were related to british leyland&apos;s investment programme and were not likely to lead toover-capacity.2.      In considering how to handle the Commission we also have totake account of current developments in the car industry in otherEEC countries.    The French Government have taken certain measuresto assist their car industry.    Volkswagen are having serious difficulties.    This will increase the pressure on the Commissionto carry out their responsibilities as laid down in the Treaty inrespect of measures which we adopt to support BLMC.    It is important that the Commission should be able to say that they were notifiedin advance of the British proposals for BLMC.3.      It would appear appropriate therefore for the UK permanent representative to be instructed to approach the Commission at ahigh level as soon as a decision has been taken on BLMC.    We should aim to give a minimum of 48 hours notice before a public announce-ment.    In speaking to the Commission the Permanent Representativewould emphasise that the proposal for the underwriting of theRights Issue involves the Government in acquiring the majority ifnot the whole of the equity, and that what is therefore involved is the extension of public ownership and control over a majorelement in the economy.    The proposed additional overdraft facilities and long term loans represent essential support for BLMC&apos;s invest-ment programme and cannot be regarded as a form of aid which mightdistort competition in a way &quot;which might be deemed incompatible with the Common Market&quot; (in terms of Article 92 of the e.c. Treaty)cThe UK representative should seek to steer the Commission in thedirection of saying,  if questioned after the further announcement,that they/
SECRETthat they had been notified of our proposals and were studyingthem.4.      There would be advantage if the UK Representative couldbe authorised to show a copy of the version of the Ryder report which is to be published to a senior member of the Commission.5. If action on these lines is approved, the necessary instructions will be drafted by officials in the FCO and department of Industry in consultation with the Cabinet Office.
