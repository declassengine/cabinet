IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 59 COPY NO 8214 May 1975CABINETEMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION ON COMPANY BOARDSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for trade. At the Ministerial Committee for Industrial Development on22 April a decision was taken to appoint an independent Committee of inquiry to advise on employee participation on company boards, and I was asked to take the lead in drafting an announcement.    I circulated a draft announcement, including the proposed terms of reference.    These were agreed by colleagues and I was to have made a statement in the Houseyesterday.2. At the last moment, however, the General Secretary of the TradesUnion Congress (TUC) wrote to the Prime Minister asking for twoamendments to the terms of reference.    He wanted the reference to european Economic Community proposals omitted and this I can accept.The second point is that the TUC asked that the terms of reference should include a statement that the extension of industrial democracy must bebased on trade union organisation.    This is of course a central point in the tuc approach to worker participation.    In practice, however, its application gives rise to very serious problems.    It would exclude the12 million non-unionised working people from representation at board level.It would also create a serious problem in securing representation of juniorand middle management on the board, which is an issue which is causing considerable difficulties in continental countries such as Germany whereemployee participation is much more advanced than here.3. Needless to say I wholeheartedly endorse the policy that we should seek to develop industrial democracy through trade union machinery.    ButI think it would be wrong to shut our faces to the difficulties which exist inrelation to non-unionised employees, and I think it important that theindependent Committee should address themselves to this problem and see whether some solution can be found.1
4. I have therefore tried to devise a formulation in the terms ofreference which recognise the importance of trade union organisation in this context but which does not completely tie the Committee^ hands on thissubject.    I am therefore proposing the following revised terms ofreference:&quot;1,       Accepting the need for a radical extension of democracy in industry through employee participation in the control of companiesby means of representation on boards of directors, and the essentialrole of trade union organisations in this process, to consider what form this might take,, taking into account the proposals in. the TUCreport on &quot;Industrial Democracy&quot; as well as other current proposals and experience in Britain and other countries,2, Having regard to the interests of the national economy,employees, investors and consumers, to analyse the implications ofdifferent schemes for such representation for the efficient management of companies and for company law&quot;.5. I invite the agreement of my colleagues to these terms of reference,in order that I can make a statement in the House on Thursday 15 May on thelines already agreed.uP department of Trade14 May 1975112
