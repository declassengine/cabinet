HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government(75) 51 COPY NO18 April 1975CABINETRYDER REPORT:   POSSIBLE METHODS OF giving effect TO RECOMMENDATIONSNote by the Attorney general. Effect may be given to the recommendations in the Ryder Reporteither i. ^s suggested by the Report) by means of an application to theCourt, or ii. by legislation which wholly avoids going to the Court.i.   SCHEME INVOLVING COURT APPLICATION2. The advantages of the Ryder proposal   are that it should enablethe Government to get control of British Leyland (BL) without a hybridBill and without a charge of &quot;forced nationalisation&quot;;  it enables share-holders to salvage something of their investment, and it is less easy for them to claim that the price is unfair, since they are offered a chance to buy more shares at the same price.    Finally, it gives BL (in its new form) a reasonably large equity lease to finance future borrowings, andenables the shares to be valued at above par.3. The disadvantages of the Ryder proposal are as follows:-Under the scheme as envisaged in the Report an application to thecourt under section 206 of the Companies Act 1948 would have to be made.The court may want to be satisfied that statutory authority exists for expenditure of moneys to implement the scheme.    It is therefore necessaryto consider the possibilities.4. The Industry Act 1972 has three defects.    It does not allow theGovernment to acquire more than 50 per cent of the shares of a company,the limits on expenditure authorised by the Act are comparatively low,and it is at least doubtful whether purchase of the shares from privateshareholders is &quot;financial assistance&quot; within the meaning of the Act.    Onthis last point, in my view a court is more likely than not to hold that thepurchase by the Government of these shares is not &quot;financial assistance&quot;to the industry as intended by the Act.1
5. It would be possible to amend section 8 of the Industry Act 1972in the Industry Bill to allow more than 50 per cent of the shares to be held.But an amendment to allow the purchase of shares to be treated as&quot;financial assistance&quot; would be likely to prove controversial and difficult.6. Nor will the passage of the Industry Bill (which would enable theNational Enterprise Board (not) to acquire the shares) be of assistancein the time needed:  the court could not, in my view, properly accept aGovernment undertaking before the Bill is law, and the Government couldnot properly commit the not, which is not even set up, to purchasing the shares and providing the money.7. It follows, in my opinion, that to enable the Ryder scheme tosecure the approval of the court, and to be implemented, the Governmentwould need to take sufficient power by means of a short enabling Bill,along the lines of the Rolls Royce (Purchase) Act 1971, to provide themoneys to pay for shares bought or subscribed for, and to provideassistance up to a specified sum for the undertakings in the BLMC group.Such a Bill is unlikely to be regarded as hybrid.8, But even after passage of such a Bill there are serious difficultiesconnected with the application to the court.    Treasury Counsel hasadvised that the risks of delay or of failure cannot be dismissed as unreal.In particular, &quot;a majority in number representing three fourths in value&quot;of each class of members and creditors affected by the scheme presentand voting, in person or by proxy, must approve the scheme.    (It appearslikely that the holders of convertible loans would be the only creditorsaffected by the scheme).    To obtain this approval, the blessing of thepresent Board, and in particular of Lord Stokes, would almost certainly be necessary.    Indeed by virtue of section 206 the company itself almost certainly will have to make the application to the court.    Even with theapproval of the Board, the shareholders may reject the scheme:  forthough the Governments offer is generous, it may be thought that tacticalopposition will produce a still better offer.    If the requisite majority ofshareholders etc. is not achieved, the scheme must fall at that stage, andthe Government has wasted time and will have to start again by a differentmethod.9.        Even if the requisite majority of shareholders approve the scheme(as may be likely) the possibilities for delay at every stage of the courtprocedure are great.    The court would allow representatives of objectingshareholders an opportunity to file evidence and be heard; if a sufficientcase for urgency can be made out it would probably be possible to have thecase heard during the Long Vacation (in August and September) and though this would not guarantee completion by October, it would give the scheme a fair chance of getting through by then.    The possibility of appeal to theCourt of Appeal cannot be wholly excluded.2
10-       Thus the success of the Ryder proposals, involving applicationto the court depend heavily on a firm recommendation by the Board to the shareholders in support of these proposals.    If such is given, the risks of action under section 206 may be worthwhile taking,    If it is not, thereis a real risk of failure either before or at the stage of the members&apos; andcreditors1 meeting or on the application itself.ii.    LEGISLATION NOT INVOLVING APPLICATION TO COURT11.       An alternative method, which would preserve most of theadvantages of the scheme in the Ryder Report, would be to implement it by legislation.    It is clear that such legislation would be hybrid, since itcompulsorily affects the rights of private individuals:  nonetheless it islikely to be a good deal less controversial than out-and-out nationalisation.The essential elements of such a Bill would be:-i.       an offer by the Government to the shareholders to buytheir shares at a specified price;ii.       an obligation on the company to raise additional capitalby making a rights issue at the same price to be underwrittenby the Government;iii. authority to the Government to pay for shares boughtor taken up; andiv. the over-riding of restrictions in the Company&apos;sArticles or Loan Deeds preventing i. and ii.12.       The actual form of the legislation would have to be carefully considered and some variation from Ryder is possible.    I doubt whether such legislation could be passed this session.    A possible timetable,given that some petitions against the Bill are bound to be presented(particularly on the footing that what the Government is doing isreconstructing the company without allowing to the shareholders the safeguards afforded by the Companies Acts), might be for the Bill to be through the Commons by the end of this session (ie, including the Octoberperiod).    It would then have to go through the Lords, but it could go through much more quickly, since all objections would have been fully considered by the Commons Select Committee.13.       A further option is a Bill to nationalise BL or to acquire its assetsas a going concern.    It would inevitably by hybrid.    The timetable given above would be likely to be extended, since the controversy would inevitably be greater, both in principle and as respects valuation methods.S SLaw Officers&apos; Department18 April 1975 3
