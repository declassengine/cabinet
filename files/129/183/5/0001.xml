SELECT COMMITTEE on science AND TECHNOLOGYGOVERNMENT OBSERVATIONS ON REPORTSESSION 1974OFFSHORE ENGINEERING1. In this White Paper the Government sets out its observations on theReport on Offshore Engineering from the Select Committee on Science and technology published in November 1974.NORTH SEA OBJECTIVESThe Governmenfs Strategy2. The Select Committee believe that the Government needs to go into greater detail in explaining its offshore objectives and the means by which they are achieved and suggest that merely stating a target production figure [for offshoreoil] for 1980 is not sufficient. These objectives must be made as part of a totalenergy policy (paragraph 114).3. The Government has fully acknowledged the need to indicate anadequately defined sense of direction in the exploitation of North Sea oil and gas and has taken a series of steps to demonstrate the main features of itsstrategy as the situation has demanded. First, in May 1974, the Secretary ofState for Energy&apos;s Report to Parliament set out in a clear and detailed way theprospects for Continental Shelf production of both oil and gas to 1980 and beyond, taking into account the prospects for discoveries not yet made; it also gave details of the likely development of the ten fields then declaredcommercial. In July of the same year - only five months after taking office -the Governmenfs White Paper on &quot;United Kingdom Offshore Oil and GasPolicy&quot; (Cmnd. 5696) set out its proposals for:(a) securing a fairer share of profits for the nation from North Sea exploita-tion and maximising the gain to the balance of payments; and(b) asserting greater public control in order to safeguard the national interest in an important resource which belongs to the nation.4. Estimates of the demand for platforms to support the development programme were included in a policy paper on platform construction sites,published on 12 August 1974 (see paragraphs 11-14 below). In statements on6 December 1974, the Secretary of State for Energy clarified important aspectsof the Governmenfs policy on depletion, refining and disposal of North Seaoil; and on 25 February 1975, the Paymaster General announced full detailsof the Governmenfs taxation proposals including the rate of Petroleum RevenueTax. The Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Bill, which was presented toParliament on 8 April 1975, includes provisions to enable the Government toestablish the British National Oil Corporation, to improve the Governmenfscontrol over the construction and use of submarine pipe-lines, to effect certain
changes in the terms of existing petroleum production licences and to authorisethe construction or extension of refineries. Most recently, the Governmentpublished on 14 April this year, a further Report to Parliament - &quot;Developmentof the oil and gas resources of the United Kingdom&quot;. Whereas the earlierReport (and its predecessor in 1973) was confined to oil and gas reserves and production, this year&apos;s Report also includes sections on international negotia-tions, the opportunities created by offshore activity for British industry, training,safety, and environmental protection.5. As to research and development (R &amp; D), the direction of effort of theShip and Marine Technology. Requirements Board (SMTRB) has been indicated both in its first Annual Report, published in June 1974 by theGovernment, and in separate statements sent to the firms and organisationsknown to have an interest in the field.North Sea Hydrocarbons and Energy policy. The Governmenfs policies on the development of North Sea resources are of central importance but as the Committee pointed out, they are, ofcourse, only one element in the overall strategy for energy. The policies standalongside a number of other major initiatives taken during the past year: theCoal Industry Examination which has mapped out a new future for the coalindustry; the decision on nuclear reactor choice which has opened the way for the future development of nuclear power in this country; and the pro-gramme of measures on energy conservation which is directed at the other side of the market, energy demand. The Government fully recognises thatthere is a complex inter-relationship between these areas and that policieson each of them need to be formulated within an intergrated framework offorecasts and analysis. The objectives for North Sea development have certainly been formulated within this overall approach.THE ROLE OF BRITISH INDUSTRYAchievements to Date7. The Select Committee have referred to the evidence submitted by theDepartment of Energy that 55 major UK contractors, 800 sub-contractors,and 2,000 other companies had been involved in supplying goods and services to offshore projects at the beginning of 1974; they feel that some large companies are reluctant to become involved in offshore work and that there is still in-sufficient pioneering effort by small and medium-sized firms (paragraph 36).The Committee also state that the effective recovery of resources from belowthe sea requires the adaptation of existing engineering skills from many differentapplications (paragraph 58).8. The Government has certainly been anxious to promote vigorous andprofitable British involvement in offshore oil and gas exploitation. It accordinglystrengthened the Offshore Supplies Office (OSO) which has the responsibilityof helping to ensure that UK industry is given a full and fair opportunityto compete in the UK Continental Shelf market and to help promote worth-
while new ventures. British industry has had some considerable successesto date. In particular, 3 steel platforms have been built in Scotland and NorthEast England including the two biggest offshore oil platforms ever constructed;with the 7 steel and 3 concrete structures for oil field development under construction or on order from UK yards, this country has won 13 of the 19orders so far placed for oil production platforms for the UK sector of theNorth Sea. Moreover, in the second half of 1974, over 150 platform moduleswere on order or being fabricated in the UK. Important orders have alsobeen won for drill ships, for underwater working and for the whole range of generating and process equipment needed on the platforms. The Govern-ment now estimates that around 40,000 jobs have been created in scotland as a result of oil-related development and in North East England some 6,700people are employed by major contractors on North Sea work with more in prospect.9. In all this work, the Government has been encouraging the adaptation ofexisting skills in British industry, particularly in the engineering sectors. only by being successful in the markets for the current generation of offshoreequipment and services can British industry expect to be well placed to meet the longer term demand for the second and third generation equipment that will be needed to exploit hydrocarbon deposits beneath even deeper waters.10. The Government shares the Committee&apos;s disappointment (paragraph 51)that British firms have not found it attractive even with offers of government financial assistance to move into some of the specialist offshore activities suchas pipelaying and offshore installation. British interests do have importantfinancial stakes in some of the major items of equipment (including ownership of a very large crane ship and a substantial interest in a lay barge) but there areno British operating companies. They are, however, risky business areas wherethe competition is strongly entrenched. Moreover a number of new lay barges and heavy-lift crane ships have been built in recent years for foreign firms thus reducing the market opportunities. But the OSO will continue to look for new opportunities that may arise and stands ready to help any British firms keen toenter the business.Sites for the Construction of Platforms11. The Select Committee recommend that the Government should avoid therisk of too many platform construction sites and keep the situation under review(paragraph 54).12. The Government published a Policy Paper &quot;Construction Sites forOffshore Oil Production Platforms&quot; on 12 August 1974 which sets out the case for &apos;a coherent Government strategy for the allocation and public control of alimited number of sites for the building of concrete platforms for the productionof oil on the UK Continental Shelf. The paper proposed that a limited numberof sites should be taken into public ownership with a number of objectives inview, including the maximisation of their use and the consequent avoidance ofproliferation. Powers to this end are included in the Offshore PetroleumDevelopment (Scotland) Act, which received the Royal Assent on 13 March1975.
13. To help in the formulation of policy it was necessary to form the best possible estimate of likely demand for major platforms for the UK sector of theNorth Sea, and the policy statement of 12 August 1974 contained such estimates.These figures are kept under regular review and revised forecasts will bepublished shortly.14. Since the demand estimates included in the statement suggested that therewould be a shortfall of concrete platform production capacity in the UK, theGovernment identified the seven designs of concrete platforms most favoured bythe oil companies. The policy statement indicated that most of the ordersforecast could be obtained for UK yards if production sites for the majority ofthese designs could be found. This has now been done and, following a seriesof planning decisions by the Secretary of State for Scotland, sites have beenfound for all but one. The Government^ policy continues to emphasise not onlythe need to avoid proliferation and to ensure continuity of operations at thosesites which are developed but also the desirability of ensuring that platforms canbe built in Britain in order to promote the interests both of the platform con-instructors themselves and of the many medium and small sized firms that canwin secondary orders.The Offshore Supplies Office (OSO)15. The Select Committee suggest that, even with the planned expansion, theOSO will be too small and under-financed for the job it has to do, that greater emphasis should be placed on the &quot;progress-chasing&quot; function and that thereshould be more local offices (paragraph 87).16. One of the first decisions announced by the present Government in April1974 was to expand the OSO and therefore during 1974 the staffing complementwas increased from about 60 to 180 and the Headquarters moved to Glasgow;by the end of April 1975, the staff in post totalled 163. The Office now possessesa wide range of expertise including engineers, scientists, economists and peoplebrought in specially from industry to add to the experience of the civilservants. The need for progress-chasing was one of the factors determining theextent of the expansion but the main responsibility for this function must rest with industry. The efforts of the OSO and the Department of Energy&apos;s PetroleumDivision can only complement those made by the oil companies and suppliersby identifying and tackling obstacles in the North Sea programme which it is within the control of Government to overcome. The need for more staff in theOSO for this and other functions will, however, be kept under continuing review.Indeed, since the Committee reported, a new Platform Sites Directorate hasbeen set up within the OSO to oversee the development of the platform con-struction sites that are being taken into public ownership. At the local level, theOSO has been strengthening its links with the regional offices of the Departmentof Industry in England, as well as the offices in Scotland and Wales. Thisavoids duplication of effort. As to finance for promoting new ventures, the OSOworks within the framework of the Industry Act 1972 and finance has not beena limiting factor.Sub-sea Systems17. The Select Committee recommend that the Government should look closely
at the potential application of sub-sea systems (paragraph 51) and they make a specific proposal for a joint Government j industry venture to assist the development in industry of the expertise and apparatus required for sea bed completions(paragraph 76); they note the main recommendations made by the working party on Technology for Exploiting Offshore Oil and Gas and hope that theseproposals will be speedily implemented (paragraph 75 and Annex II).18. The Government fully endorses the Committee&apos;s view that sub-seacompletions could have an increasingly important part to play in the exploitation of offshore oil and gas in deeper waters. A large number of systems or partialsystems are already in use in relatively shallow waters such as in the Gulf ofMexico. For deep water operations the technology still has to be fully de-developed; and the extent and speed with which such systems will come into wide-spread use is inevitably uncertain, depending among other things on how muchoil is found in deep waters in future and the relative economics of alternative means of exploitation.19. In this situation, the Government is operating on two fronts. The first is to ensure that it is fully informed about existing concepts for sub-seasystems. For this purpose the Department of Energy and British Petroleum(BP), working through the SMTRB and with the assistance of the Departmentof Industry, commissioned an appraisal by consultants of the whole range ofnovel production systems, including sea bed completion systems. The con-clusions of this appraisal are being considered by Government as part of amore general exercise devoted to specifying in detail the ways in which theconclusions of the Working Party on Technology for Exploiting Offshore Oiland Gas can best be followed up. This work will take some months yet tocomplete. When it is done, however, it will provide the basis for a coherentand comprehensive approach to policy on R &amp; D related to the exploitation of oil and gas in deeper waters. In the course of the work, the possibility of a specific joint venture between Government and industry as suggested by the Com-mittee will be borne in mind but it would be premature to make any decisions on it at this stage.20. The second aspect is that of involvement by British industry in thedevelopment of sub-sea completion systems. There is already some involvementthrough BP&apos;s stake in the SEAL consortium and other British firms arepursuing alternative concepts. But the Government agrees that more involve-ment by industry could be advantageous. The OSO attaches a high priority to this area and has devoted considerable efforts to encouraging, for example,partnerships that could be of advantage to British firms. Precisely how industry can best be involved will depend to a considerable extent on which systemsprove to be the most effective. Accordingly, the OSO keeps closely in touchwith the developing situation with the aim of helping British industry tocapitalise on the opportunities when they arise.ECGD Support for Offshore Work21. The Select Committee recommend that assistance to firms for offshoreschemes should be comparable to that of Export Credit Guarantee Department(ECGD) support and thai these facilities should be made available to UK firmsseeking offshore business (paragraph 81).
22. The ECGD, under its statutory authority, has the power to issueguarantees only for the purpose of encouraging trade with other countries.Its facilities cannot therefore be used to cover contracts between UK suppliersand UK registered companies operating on the UK Continental Shelf whileforeign suppliers can use their national export credit schemes. This is of course the normal situation for goods used within the UK but the Continental Shelfsituation has two special features: first UK firms have no tariff protection and second the usual compensating advantage of proximity to the market isin many cases negligible or non-existent. Also for many items British firmsnew to the market are facing powerful competition from overseas firms withlong experience in the business.23. Consequently, in November 1973 the then Government instituted underSection 8 of the Industry Act 1972 the Offshore Supplies Interest Relief GrantScheme and, under it, grants may be paid to reduce the cost of credit involvedin the supply of goods and services to fixed installations for developing oiland gas resources in the UK Continental Shelf. The current rate of grant is  % per annum. Precise comparisons between the effective rate of borrowingwith the benefit of these grants and terms under ECGD facilities are difficultto make because they depend both on the particular borrowing arrangementsmade by oil companies and on assumptions about interest rate movementsfor up to eight years hence. The 3% grants go a long way to close the gap between interest rates for commercial borrowing and fixed rate export creditschemes but the Government keeps the position under review so that the needfor further action can be considered if it seems justified.RESEARCH AND development organisation for Offshore Technology24. The Select Committee recommend that a Board separate from theSMTRB should be set up to deal with marine technology (paragraph 96); thatthe new Board should have a larger budget (paragraph 97); and that it shouldbe a focal point for information on marine technology (paragraph 98).25. The organisation of Government in areas such as this always involves a difficult balance between sometimes conflicting criteria. As the Committeepoint out, clear objectives and lines of responsibility are desirable; but at thesame time, the structure must facilitate as far as practicable co-ordination ofcomplementary interests. Problems of this kind arise particularly in the field of marine technology because of the variety of activities that go on in the marine environment (oil and gas exploitation, other minerals, fishing, com-mercial shipping, defence activities and so on) and because of the vast range ofindustrial and commercial interests that have some application in the marinefield. The marine sector does not represent a single industry in itself but isa market for parts of most of the country&apos;s major industrial sectors. the organisational structure for marine technology must therefore take accountof Departments&apos; functional responsibilities for the different customers forthe research (in the fields of energy, industry, shipping, defence, fisheries andthe environment).
26. In this situation, the Government believes that it would be wrong to separate entirely the SMTRB&apos;s responsibilities for shipping and shipbuildingfrom those for marine technology generally. There can be important overlapsbetween the two areas and the risk of losing the benefits of technology transfersbetween them should be minimised. Moreover, the SMTRB has been inexistence now for only just over two years and the Government believes thatin that time the work of the Board has substantially improved the effectiveness of the Governments R&amp;D expenditure within its field of responsibility.However, the Government considers that re-arrangement of the functions ofthe SMTRB is necessary particularly in the light of the creation of the Depart-ment of Energy since the Board was established. Accordingly, the Secretary ofState for Energy is setting up a new advisory Board, the Offshore EnergyTechnology Board (OETB), under the Chairmanship of his Chief Scientist totake over from the SMTRB the responsibility for supervising the developmentof his Departments programme of R &amp; D related to offshore oil and gasexploitation.27. The OETB, which will include among its members senior executives fromoil companies, will advise on R &amp; D directed both towards ensuring the safety of offshore installations and towards improving the competitive position ofBritish industry in the offshore field; it will report to the Secretary of State forEnergy. In particular, this arrangement will enable the research programme tobe integrated with the total efforts of the Department of Energy in the offshorefield which is essential if the results of successful R &amp; D are to be effectivelyexploited. The Committee emphasised the need to relate R&amp;D closely to theindustry it is meant to serve and the participation by senior executives from the oil companies - who are the ultimate customers for the R&amp;D- will facilitatethis. To ensure co-ordination with other parts of the Government machine, thenew Board will also have representatives from other Government Departments;and importantly there will be cross-membership with the SMTRB which willcontinue to deal with the marine technology requirements of the departments of Industry and Trade.28. The new Board will advise on the expenditure of the Department of energy&apos;s budget for offshore marine technology, which includes that part of theSMTRBS budget allocated for offshore oil and gas technology. The need for additional finance for new projects coming within the ambit of the OETBwill of course depend on its assessment of the priorities and the circumstances prevailing at the time but the Government has noted the Select Committeesview that the new Board proposed by them should have a larger budget thanthat allocated to offshore affairs under the previous arrangements.Commercial work in Defence Establishments29. The Select Committee recommend that Defence establishments should been abled to undertake further commercial work on a contract basis, participate injoint projects with industry or Civil Departments, and should make their facilitiesmore widely known in industry (paragraph 74).30. The Government accepts the importance of making available the expertiseand facilities of Defence R&amp;D Establishments to undertake work in support
of the offshore industry. This policy has been pursued for some time within thelimits of existing resources as shown in the evidence submitted to the SelectCommittee describing a number of areas in which relevant research work iscarried out. Additional resources arising as a result of reductions in defence commitments will be made available to meet clearly defined civil requirements.31. The Ministry of Defence, in consultation with the Departments of Industryand Energy, are examining further measures to ensure that the expertise and facilities available in Defence R&amp;D Establishments are brought to the attentionof industry. Contacts with existing and potential civil customers are beingextended, and further progress has been made towards identifying a programmeof civil requirements since the Ministry of Defence gave evidence.R &amp; D to Increase Recoverable Oil and Gas Reserves32. The Select Committee propose that a joint Government/industry ventureshould explore the problems involved in increasing the recoverable oil and gasreserves of sub-sea fields and develop the relevant technology (paragraph 76).33. The problems of increasing the recoverable reserves of oil and gas fieldsare basically the same whether these fields are under the sea or on land. This isa matter that has been a subject for research by the oil companies for manyyears because even a small increase in percentage recovery can lead to very large increases in actual volumes. In the past, increases have come from such tech-techniques as water, gas or solvent injection, underground combustion and varia-tions of these techniques.34. Nevertheless, the Government agrees that there is probably still scope forfurther improvements in recovery techniques and will give careful considerationto proposals for research work leading to increased oil and gas recovery.SAFETY OF OPERATIONS OFFSHOREGovernment Measures and Initiatives35. The Select Committee recommend that more R&amp;D and better safetystandards must be devised to improve the safety of operations offshore and belowthe sea; navigation standards must be tightened and measures for the control of pollution improved (paragraph 76).36. The Government appreciates that the rapid development of the offshoreindustry has pushed current technology to the present known limits; and,because of this, the UK was one of the first countries to introduce a comprehensive-sive statutory code of safety. In a little over three years, the Government hasintroduced seven sets of Regulations under the Mineral Workings (OffshoreInstallations) Act 1971 and three further sets are in preparation. Their coverageis described in the Appendix. The Government is already sponsoring, throughthe SMTRB, an extensive programme of projects aimed at further improving the safety of offshore operations and, in particular, our knowledge of the design,
construction and operation of offshore installations. Many of these projectsinvolve co-operation and cost-sharing with the offshore industry.37. The Department of Trade, in consultation with the lighthouse authorities,takes steps to ensure that installations are adequately marked and lighted forthe benefit of shipping and to avoid the risk of collision; marking requirements are kept under review and comply with internationally agreed standards.38. The Government is continually seeking improved means of combatingoil pollution at sea. The Central Unit on Environmental Pollution within theDepartment of the Environment is, in conjunction with other Departments,undertaking a study of the pollution hazards at sea posed by offshore oil opera-tions and the resources assigned to minimising these risks, and for dealing withany pollution that may occur. In addition, the Secretary of State for Trade, whohas responsibilities for oil spills at sea which threaten major pollution of thecoast, has established a Standing Committee on Pollution Clearance at Sea,with joint industrial and Government representation. The Committee&apos;s remitis to review the present coastal clearance capability and to advise on whatimprovements might be made.Certification of Installations39. The Select Committee recommend that the Government should reach agreement with the Institution of Civil Engineers and the Institution of StructuralEngineers on the procedure for certifying concrete structures and the appropriatepersons or bodies to carry out the certification (paragraph 122).40. The Offshore Installations (Construction and Survey) Regulations 1974cover the safe design, construction and survey of installations. Under theirprovisions every installation operating on the UK Continental Shelf on or after31 August 1975 will have to possess a valid Certificate of Fitness issued byone of the five Certifying Authorities. These were appointed by the Secretaryof State for Energy after he had satisfied himself as to their competence to dealwith all aspects of certification. However, recognising that fixed offshore instal-lations presented particular problems of their own, he said that he would also consider whether a limited number of further appointments should be made forfixed gravity structures and will particularly consider appointing consulting engineers for this type of work. The Government is currently discussing withthe Association of Consulting Engineers how best to increase the involvement ofthe profession.41. Regulations lay down the broad principles to be followed; the detailedstandards are incorporated in a non-statutory document entitled: &quot;Guidance onthe design and construction of offshore installations&quot;. This provides a flexiblemethod of updating the standards as our knowledge and experience increase. Ofthose Regulations to be introduced, one set will relate to matters of operationalsafety.42. The Government has set up an Advisory Committee on Fixed OffshoreInstallations in agreement with the Institutions of Civil and of StructuralEngineers. The Chairman of the Committee is Sir Kirby Laing and the member-
ship is drawn from representatives of the consulting engineering profession, theconstruction industry, research and development organisations, the oil companies, the Certifying Authorities and the Petroleum Production division and Offshore Supplies Office of the Department of Energy. This Committeewill be advising on specific problems arising from fixed installations, particularlyconcrete platforms and their certification, and will also consider the furtherinvolvement of British engineering expertise in the design, construction andcertification of offshore installations.Voluntary Safety Code and Inspection43. The Select Committee recommend that, pending legislation, the Governmentshould endeavour to persuade the oil companies and contractors to accept a voluntary safety code and voluntary inspection (paragraph 126).44. Licensees are required by the terms and conditions of their explorationand production licences to operate in accordance with good oil field practice and to follow recommended codes of safe practice, for example, the Institute ofPetroleum Code. Enforcement of these requirements is carried out by theDepartment of Energy&apos;s Petroleum Production Inspectorate who also enforce the Safety Regulations made to date under the Mineral Workings (OffshoreInstallations) Act 1971.45. The UK Offshore Operators Association has recommended to all its members that the requirements of the Offshore Installations (Diving Operations)Regulations 1974 and the Merchant Shipping (Diving Operations) Regulations1975 be adopted by them in all diving operations on the UK Continental Shelfcarried out on their behalf including those from foreign registered ships. Pendingthe passing of the Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Bill, the diving con-tractors engaged on pipe-laying operations are also being encouraged to complywith these Regulations.Diving Safety v46. The Select Committee recommend that an Order in Council be made assoon as possible under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 to enable safety regulations to be made covering all diving on the UK Continental Shelf not subjectto Regulations under the Mineral Workings (Offshore Installations) Act 1971(paragraph 124).47. At present, the Offshore Installations (Diving Operations) Regulations1974, which came into force on 1 January 1975, require that all plant and equip-ment associated with diving are of suitable construction and properly main-tained, that all diving personnel are suitably qualified and medically fit, and thatdiving operations are carried out in accordance with safety procedures approvedby the Secretary of State for Energy. The Regulations also place responsibilities and obligations on specific classes of person to comply with these requirements.Similar requirements for diving from UK registered ships are contained in theMerchant Shipping (Diving Operations) Regulations which came into force on1 March 1975. The Department of Energy is seeking powers in the petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Bill to enable it to bring diving activities in connection
with submarine pipe-laying operations under statutory control; in the meantime the voluntary arrangements mentioned in paragraph 45 above will continue.48. An Inter-departmental Diving Committee is urgently examining the feasibility of a common set of regulations covering all such diving safetyincluding diving from all UK registered ships wherever they may be. these could be made under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and a necessarypre-requisite would be an Order-in-Council along the lines of that recommendedby the Select Committee. If it proves impracticable to make a common set of regulations the Committee will ensure that the various sets of diving regulations,both existing and proposed, are based on common standards.49. Proper training is an important feature in diving safety. A  2 millionunderwater training centre is being set up in Scotland out of public funds andthis will help to meet the greatly increased commercial demand for divers in theoffshore oil and gas development programme. The centre will be responsiblefor the development of training standards and methods with particular attentionto the health and safety aspects of diving.A Unified Inspectorate for Diving Safety50. The Select Committee recommend that a strong and probably unifiedinspectorate for diving safety should be established and that the Navy can givevaluable advice and assistance (paragraph 127).51. The Department of Energy is currently strengthening its PetroleumProduction Inspectorate and is recruiting specialised Diving Inspectors. ThisInspectorate also enforces the Department of Trade&apos;s Merchant Shipping(Diving Operations) Regulations and thus covers all offshore diving operations.The Department of Energy already receives technical and medical advice and assistance from the Royal Naval Physiological Laboratory, the AdmiraltyExperimental Diving Unit at Portsmouth, and the Medical Director General(Navy). It also has assistance and advice from the Employment MedicalAdvisory Service and other specialists in underwater medicine.HYDROGRAPHY AND THE ROLE OF THE ROYAL NAVYHydrographic Surveys of the UK Continental Shelf52. The Select Committee recommend that provision be made for a substantial increase of ships and equipment for the hydrographic survey of the continental shelf and that the &quot;customer/contractor principle&quot; be utilised to fund the Hydro-grapher of the Navy mainly from civil expenditure (paragraph 119).53. The formation of a Study Group, led by the Ministry of Defence, toconsider the requirements of the shipping and offshore development industries and other civil interests including surveying work on the UK Continental Shelfwas announced in Parliament on 17 July 1974. The Group has now completed its work and its report is under consideration. The resources needed for the
future surveying task, both on defence and civil account, are being identified inthe light of the Defence Review. The method of funding the Hydrographer ofthe Navy is also under consideration by the Government.Notification of Obstacles to Navigation54. The Select Committee recommend that existing statutory requirements should be enforced to ensure notification of the establishment, movement orabandonment of structures on the sea bed of the UK Continental Shelf and thatthere should be substantial penalties for non-compliance. Existing legislation should be reviewed and the Royal Navy should be given the responsibility for inspection and enforcement (paragraph 120).55. The procedures for notification of obstacles to navigation are compre-hensive and are of course kept under continuing review. Section 34 of the CoastProtection Act 1949 as applied and extended to the UK Continental Shelf statesthat the prior written consent of the Secretary of State is required for certainoperations below the high water mark of ordinary spring tides if obstruction ordanger to navigation is caused or is likely to result. The Section also providesthat a consent shall be subject to such conditions as the Secretary of State may think fit having regard to the nature and extent of the obstruction or danger.As the Committee have reported, consents issued for exploration wells includeconditions to ensure that the Hydrographer to the Navy is advised of all rigmovements and the abandonment (either temporary or permanent) of explor-explanatory well heads. The same requirement applies to production wells although no production site has yet been abandoned. The Secretary of State also has tobe satisfied that the sea bed site is left to his satisfaction. Licensees wishing toabandon a well are also required to obtain the consent of the Department of energy under the terms attached to the exploration and production licences issued under the Continental Shelf Petroleum (Production) Regulations 1966.The provisions of these Regulations are enforced by that DepartmentsPetroleum Production Inspectorate.56. Administrative arrangements between the Departments of Trade andEnergy and the Ministry of Defence are kept under review to ensure that thenecessary information about the suspension or abandonment of well heads orthe positioning of drilling rigs and platforms is available to all concerned. Inparticular, measures are being taken to improve notification to the fishing industry.57. The Government proposes to review Part II of the Coast Protection Act1949 and noting the Committee&apos;s views, to consider the adequacy of existingpenalties under this part of the Act and the general question of enforcement. Itis unlikely that any formal responsibility will be placed on the Royal Navy to police abandoned exploratory well heads and the Governments current view isthat the responsibility of the Royal Navy should be limited to recording andpromulgation of information by the Hydrographer.Protection of Offshore Installations58. The Select Committee recommend that Ministers should initiate an inquiry
to establish requirements for the protection of offshore installations (paragraph121).59. The Government shares the Committee&apos;s concern over the need to protectoffshore installations. The Minister of State for Defence made a statement onthis subject in the House of Commons on 11 February 1975. He pointed outthat the Government has been considering how best to protect the growing number of offshore oil and gas installations from accidental or maliciousdamage. As a result, five new vessels will be built for the Royal Navy similar tothe offshore fishery protection vessel operated by the Department of Agricultureand Fisheries for Scotland (DAFS). In addition, up to- four Royal AirForce aircraft will be provided to carry out the surveillance of offshore waters.These will be existing aircraft which may need some modification for theparticular task.60. The new ships and the aircraft are expected to begin to enter service in1977. Meanwhile the DAFS vessel Jura has been loaned to the Royal navy and the ocean-going tug Reward will be recommissioned in the summer. Bothwill be lightly armed, given improved communications facilities and manned by the Royal Navy as warships. Other Naval vessels and service aircraft willcontinue to pass through the area and the RAF have instituted routine airpatrols of the installations. The Government also intends to consult closely withneighbouring countries to explore ways of providing increased common support.EDUCATION AND TRAINING61. The Select Committee recommend that the University Grants Committeeshould examine whether the effort in education and training in universities is sufficient in the light of the Report of the Inter-departmental Working Party on&apos; Education and Training for Offshore Development&quot; (ETOD); they recommend asimilar study for polytechnics (paragraph 64).62. The University Grants Committee had already examined the ETODReport and circulated it to all universities. The Committee had prepared a survey of all under-graduate and post-graduate courses in universities relevant to offshore development and these are included in the ETOD Report. It was inthe light of this information that the Working Party agreed to recommend theestablishment of one or two centres to provide post-graduate, post-entry and post-experience courses in petroleum engineering. After consulting the industry the Committee agreed to support the establishment of such centres at Heriot -Watt University and Imperial College, London University. The necessaryrecurrent expenditure has been provided by the Committee and the Departmentof Energy has exceptionally provided a grant of  300,000 for the building atHeriot-Watt University.63. The Government has also agreed to finance proposals put forward by the petroleum Institute Training Board for the establishment of a Drilling Tech-nology Training Centre in Scotland. It is hoped that the Centre will provide a
powerful stimulus for British enterprise in the relatively new and difficult areaof offshore drilling. A drilling rig is being purchased and delivery is expected intime for the first course at the Centre, beginning in August 1975. As noted inparagraph 49 above, the Government is also supporting an underwater training centre at Loch Linnhe in the Fort William area.64. The Department of Education and Science and the Scottish education department are maintaining close touch with polytechnics and other further education establishments which may have contributions to make to the needsof the offshore industry, and have ensured that they are aware of the ETODReport. Furthermore, each polytechnic (and central institution in Scotland) isexpected to maintain close relations with those parts of industry and commerceneeding the skills and knowledge which it is particularly able to impart. Thereis no reason to doubt that those institutions able to contribute in the case ofeducation of the offshore industry appreciate the strength of this demand andwill seek to respond accordingly.
