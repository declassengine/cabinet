CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS TH10 PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOV CUNMKNTC(81) 10 COPY NO19 February 1981CABINET81.1981 PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SUR1 BYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer1. I propose, and would Like to announce In general terms In conjuni Honwith the publication of the Public Expenditure While Paper ( PKW I ), rh.in^iHiin the way in which we conduct the annual Public Expenditure Survey, begimthis year.    They are designed in part directly to strengthen control andpressure Lor economy and ef.fi &lt; i em y,   hut mainly to eiiahle ali ol uii m Cabinetto see more clearly the prospective cash costs of expenditure as events developand decisions are taken.     I believe thin will contribute to more ellei liveoverall management of public expenditure.2. Our . ocord so far on this is disappointing.     Many ol our supporteiare highly critical.     The effects &quot;&quot; the Outlook for even the RlOOt economi &lt; allydesirable tax cuts, for tin: Public Sector Borrowing Kequl remerd and so f  rinterest rates, are widely resented.3. When the full planned and forecast costs ol expenditure for next y.arare published shortly, it wili be seen that total cash expenditure is projoi ledto have risen from  77 billion in 1979-80 to , 94 billion in 1980-81 and 104 billion in 1981-82.     Over the two-year period the increase is 35 per C6At&lt;This is more than the rate of inflation over the same period.      And there hasbeen a sharp vise in the proportion of Gross Domestic Product we have takenfor public expenditure.4. This has happened La spite of considerable and repeated efforts to holdand reduce expenditures.     Some of the explanation Ees in commitmentsinherited from the previous Government, especially on public service pay. Amajor factor has of course been the recession.     Jt would be foolish to blamethe system and to expect changes in the system to solve anything like all QUIproblems or to make difficult decisions unnecessary.    But I am convincedthat the system under which we have planned expenditure has pla/ed animportant and damaging roJe in preventing US all from being as fully andpromptly aware of what was happening as we should be.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5. This weaki ess turns particularly on the traditional and uut &gt;oJ date&quot;constant prices&quot; baiis of the Survey.    This basin was usH from the nulnHwhen the medium-term planning system, desirable in itself, was int trodut odsome 20 years ago.     Ru* inf&apos;aiion Is very difforeni now from what it was ill. n.The much higher, and highly variable, rates of inflation Of recent years have,made the system more and more misleading.    It prevents via from focusingon, or even knowing clearly, the cash implications of our decisions and thelikely development of overall cash costs, as wo go along.    And those cashdevelopments can falsify our intentions,    A striklJ g illustration is that, afterthe Cabinet decisions taken last November, it was jtill not possible for me toknow their implications for actual cash expenditure in L981-82 until a couple ofweeks ago, and the eventual figures could - and did - contain some unwelcomesurprises.6. I attach a .specification of the arrangement! I propose for adoption forthe 1981 Survey, about to begin.    In essence, it provides for all plans anddiscussions, at least for the principal target year of 1982-83,  to be conductedfrom the outset in terms of the kinis of cash values which will apply Ln thaiyear.     The focus throughout will bo on ultimate cash cost.     Thin isessentially tne way in which any family (and almost every bu id nesn) con side rsits budget for the year ahead.7. The arrangements will not be easy.    An interdepartmental groupedofficials last year rejected on balance a number of similar proposals. Theparticular scheme I am proposing does not - no scheme can - overcome allthe difficulties.     There will be technical problems of analysis.....tnitoringand presentation, for which the best solutions will bo found only in practice.Some of the burden of unc ortainty ir.h e rent in unpr edicta bl e p i - i &lt; e mo momentsmust be transferred to spending manag :r , adding Jo the problems they havehad to learn to face for more limited periods in handling cash limits. Therewill certainly be difficult (el though possibly more helpful) dis&lt; usido is inCabinet.     Colleagues may find it helpful if I briefly highlight one or two of * * imain problems.8. First, it will be necessary for Cabinet, to adopt for a period aheadinitially as long as 18 months or so - provisional figures for the Likely C0U1  of inflation, and to decide whether to distinguish between the likely generalrate of inflation and the increases the Government is prepared to see in itsown costs, both for public service pay and for other prices.     We cannot; in ahighly uncertain world hope for close accuracy of prediction though we mayhope normally to do better than during the particularly uneven past four orfive years.     This is bound to mean an occasional need to review ourassumptions, perhaps to make adjustments, but with the considerableadvantage of doing so in terms which will show us at once the overall &lt; ashexpenditure implications.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL9. Secondly, my proposals will give greate. wight to tho constraints ohcash costs compared with the traditional sense of &quot;entitlement&quot; to someparticular volume or level of service,     But there wil1 be |i ope for review OJbofh general and particular movement of costs, and adjustments of cashprovision to meet them.     The presumption will he, as 1 believe it should he,that increased provision will be made only if thoroughly justified, and not ;i s a!present largely autonia &apos;ieally.     In some areas o| expenditure| particularlythose which we have not found it possible to subject to cash limits, the mainproblem will be that of prediction,  rather than dire&apos;-1 control.     I&apos;sven so, weshall arm ourselves heller to consider these areas of expenditure, as well astheir impact on the total, if we are constantly aw.ire ol their prospectivedevelopment in actual cash cost.10. Thirdly, colleagues concerned with cash-limited expenditure! will notethat the form of revaluation proposed at the outset of the Survey builds fromyear to year, including the effect of cash limits set previously.    The practicalresult is that any squeeze or slack which may have emerged for spend) igmanagers in handling expenditure within cauli limits in one year wouldnormally be cai ried forward into the next. year.     This contrasts with thecurious feature of the present system (reflecting the traditional &lt; ommit m en I toa particular volume of expenditure irrespective oJ cost) that a part ol therevaluation process each year has been to restore cash provision toaccommodate price changes in the previous year, whatever uffocl the cashlimits for that previous year may have had.11. It must be right to carry forward effectC of economy and efficiency inthis way.    i recognise, however, that there must, he limits, and that 8cumulative series of squeezes year after year could rapidly reach un ealiltlilevels.     i. y proposals allow colleagues responsible tor cash-limitedprogrammes to seek special adjustments where they believe their actualexperience of price movements in those programmes, and inability &apos; &gt; absorbthem without intolerable reductions in levels of service* Justify increased cashprovision.     Again, it is right that the presumption should he that continuingefforts are made to operate within cash constraints, and without specialadjustments, but this can be no more than a presumption.12. Finally, the specifications of the scheme leave Open the question howfar we should attempt to carry detailed planning beyond the fo&lt; aJ year ol ea&lt; hSurvey and on what basis of valuation.     Either of the alternatives indi&lt; ate I inparagraph 10 of the attached paper would be consistent with my proposals lor1982-83.     This question could be considered further on the o&lt; c.mion when,shortly after publication of the PEWP, I present colleagues with actualproposed figures, the detailed ground rules for launching the L981 Survey Oflwhich I shall need their agreement.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCONTINGENCY RESERVE13. There i:. a related change which 1 propone we should make now,affecting expenditure Ll) 198] 82.14. The contingency reserve has operated in the pest as a control &amp;ndecisions to add to the /olumo of expenditure.     As paid of the move towards agreater emphasis on cash spend,   I propose tluit any decision we take hincrease a cash limit should be   charge on the res irve, regardless of whe&apos;h ithe change is technically classified as volume or pay or price.15. For expenditure not subjeci to cash limits, the reserve In 1981-82would continue to he confined to decisions we lake to add I,   volume.      \&gt;&apos;&lt; i1982-83 we will need to look again at this area in the light of our decisions 0(1the cash basis . &gt;t the Survey.CONCLUSION16. I invite colleagues :-a. To agree broadly on changes in the L981 Survey, on the linen 0ithe attached specifications.b. To endorse the proposal in paragraphs 11-15 on id    conHng. ncyreseive,c.

CONI 11H Nl 1alPROPOSED CHANGES IN PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEYTho following is a specification of the proposed changes, withDome comment on their immediate implications.1981 Survey:    The Target Year 1902-832. The starting-point will be the provisional planning figuresagreed for 1902-03 as a result of  the  1900 Survey.     These will tinpublished in the Public Expenditure White Paper next month in &quot;1980survey prices&quot;  (broadly the prices of 1979-00 or around autumn 1.9/9).3. The first objective will bo to lay the basis for discussionof 1902-03 plans in the course of the 1981 survey in terms of thecash or approximate prices of 1902-03 in which money  in that yearwill actually be spent.    This requires a form of revaluationcovering a span of throe years.    It is intended to carry throughthe whole revaluation at  tho outset,  but  there will  be  two stagesin the process, and each needs to be specified:-i(a) Departments will  be  invited  to  revalue  I.heir I&apos;IMIand 1902-03 plans,  first, by the normal  &quot;survey to survey&quot;revaluation from autumn  1979  to autumn  1900  (or  from average1979-00 prices to estimated average 1980-01 prices), and thenby the cash limits factors agreed for 1981-82.    This workhas already been dons for cash limits for 1981-82,  but shouldbe extended to non-cash-1imited expenditure in that year andto all expenditure in 1982-83.    The figures for 19U1-02 shouldaccord closely with the cash figures boing included  in thePublic Expenditure White Paper this year for the  first time.(b) A further adjustment to the 1982-83 figures wiJI   then bemade by the Treasury to reflect provisional assumptions aboutinflation between 1981-82 and 1982-83.    These assumptions(covering public service pay and prices) will be consideredby Cabinet on the basis of proposals by the Chancellor.4.      From this process,  there will emerge base-line figures for/1982-03 which will

In  some caries,   later&apos; adjustments mny  be possible,/until January.
CONFIDENTIALinflation assumptions for years beyond 1982-83,  which would thenmake-it possible to present and discuss plans for those future yearsin values provisionally judged appropriate to each of them.11, There would be a continuing demand for analysis of the traditionakind on a &quot;constant price basis&quot; extending into both past and future.Probably the simplest and most convenient response for the time beingwill be to retain 1979-80  (1980 survey prices)  as the base year andexpress other years in 1979-80 prices,  with relative price effects(ie in &quot;cost terms&quot;).    Departments would be able to comment, ini relevant chapters in Part 2 of the White Paper,  on the evolutionevels of service within individual programmes,  by reference tothis series or any other usefully illustrative measurement they maydevelop. . .... *Public Presentation12. The annual Public Expenditure White Paper, beginning in 1982,would reflect the new basis of the survey system.    1982-83 figuresautomatically be expressed in terms of the cash numbers whichI been agreed by Cabinet.    The treatment of subsequent years would&apos;end on the decision taken for handling 1983-84:    there would be her a &quot;constant price series&quot; showing the provisionally planned&apos;lume changes from 1982-83 onwards,  or a provisional view ofProspective cash expenditures for each subsequent year.
IHlNI 1 lit l\l 1 LAI.until January.    Those responsible for managing Estimates ami otherplan  within Departments,  and particularly thoso concerned withinstructing outside agencies (local authorities,  health authorities,etc) will be very conscious of the need to reach  finality  in orderto give timely instructions to managers and print Estimates forPariiament.9. Although there will have been a procoss early in 1901 analogousto that by which cash limits pay and price factors have been set.in the past,  and that process may remain identifiable, particularlyif adjustments are made late in tho survey cyclo,  the basic discussionin Cabinet about expenditure plans,  being conducted in cash, willnot make the same distinction between volume changes and pricoadjustments as has been made in the past.    Much of the discussionwill of course be concerned with levols of service and theirprospective cost,  but the arithmetic will be geared  to  the  final cashnumbers,  rather than to their precise composition.    The initialarithmetic of pay increases may well have become overlaid by avariety of adjustments to cash totals which in some areas mayeffectively mask it,  and this could be helpful.    Of course individualmanagers and negotiators will need to make their own calculationsof the amount of money available to finance pay increases,  but theymay in some areas be able to achieve a degree of freedom of nugotintiowithin their own cash target figure, without the inhibition that thebasis of their calculations is officially and publicly announced.Later Years10. Either of two ways of treating later years would be consistentwith the arrangements for the target year (1902-03) describod above.One would be simply to express and discuss plans for later years inthe same sort of prices as 1982-03.    For this purpose,  no decisionswould be needed beyond those required to establish 1982-03 figures.The question of conversion of 1903-04 figures to cash valuesappropriate for that year would be left for Cabinet discussion afterthe 1902 Budget, when the ground rules are set for the 1982 surveylooking at 1903-04.    The alternative would be to take decisions thisysar,  necessarily on a provisional basis,  about the appropriate/inflation assumptions
