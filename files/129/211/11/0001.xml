Foreign, economic and social  policies all  play I heir pari -but defence is fundamental.The United Kingdom makes an outstanding contribution to theWestern alliance - for without collective security Ihrough natothere could be no effect i.vo do I once of our own count ry. Laidyear our defence expenditure rose by around 5% in real terms,at a time when our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) actually fell;and our contribution to NATO oxpt eased as a propori ion of COP issignificantly higher than that of our principal  European allies.But, together with our Allies, wo faco r.rowiir, problems inmeeting the threat posed by the military forces of the WarsawPact.    If we are to keep tho peace -  if we ore to dehor anypotential aggressor - NATO must show that it is capable ofresisting attack at any level and in any form.Our part in meeting the collective needs of NATO  for abalanced response to the threat is unique.    Alone  among ourEuropean allies we contribute to the Strategic Nuclear forces ofNATO, to the land and air forces in the ceni ral rep, ion,  to theNaval and Maritime Air Forces in the Channel and Eastern Atlanticand to the defence of our own home base.To carry out our contribution in each ol   these are/is requiresa mix of forces - ships, aircraft, armoured vehicles, weapons,electronic sensors and a whole range of supporting equipmentbest suited to the tactical circumstances of each theatre ofoperations.    The mix of force:: cannot be slal i&lt;   -  I he militarydoctrine, organisation,  tactics and equipment of the Warsaw Pac1forces are changing continuously; new equipment becomes availablefor our own and Allied Armed Forces; and the relative costs ofdifferent equipments change with economic circumstances.The relentless application of technology to military useby the Soviet Union over the last ten years has greatly increasedthe problems facing our own equipment designers.   The sophisticationand, therefore, the cost, of equipment has risen, and continuesto rise, alarmingly.    On the one hand this has made unit costsfor all types of weapons much higher and, with necessarily limitedmeans, has forced us in the past to cut down on numbers procured.Changing technology has created new challenges for our armedforces and is profoundly affecting I he tactics which they adopt.New ways must be found of holding down unit costs and we mustre-shape our forces to meet the changing threat.1
By itself, defence technology does not have, an inbuilt biastowards cither the defender or the attacker.   The greatest strengthof the Western tradition lies in its diversity,  in Its enterpriseand free spirit.    The Western Alliance has great   strength  in theinnovative powers of its industrial base.   The Government intendsto support fully its advanced industries, but intends to concentrateeffort upon the areas where the greatest return can he produced.Charges cannot happen over night.    The value of the total inventoryof ships, aircraft, vehicles and weapons available to our armedforces is enormous.    That stock embodies past decisions and pasttechnology.    As far as possible the Government will  favour new programmes embodyingnew technology and new tactical concepts.Technology changes quickly, but it takes time for it toreach our Forces through new equipment.   The same is true ofchanges driven by shifts in the threat,  in the mix of our forcesand in tactical thinking.    Change is overdue.    But Lhe   last, fiveyears have not been propitious for change.    Successive budgetarypressures have meant cut backs on procurement and given theinevitable contractual complications -of a large investmentprogramme these cuts have fallen unduly on newer, smaller programmes.One consequence is that the capital, stock is unbalanced with toomany resources tied up in weapons platforms, whether at sea, onland, or in the air, and not enough in the weapons arid sensor,&quot;they carry.    The economic pressures generated by the currentrecession and the faster industrial deliveries of major existingequipments has also cut deeply into procurement of: some annum i i I ion,fuel and oil, and essential spares.    It has been necessary to cutback on activity to an unreasonable extent.    Again, the re-csLalel i shiueiuof a proper balance, in the programme is essential.So the time has come to look realistically and with an openmind at the way in which our forces fulfil their various roles.I shall be considering in the coming months, with the Chiefs ofStaff, and consulting our Allies in NATO, how technological andother changes can help us fulfil those same roles more effectivelyin the future without the massive increase in real defenceexpenditure which the escalation of equipment costs would seemto imply.    This Statement describes very fully the background toour consideration.    I hope it will contribute to a wider understandingof our defence policy and the capabilities of our forces, and toan informal public debate about .the new direction   we should lake.SECRET

Those words from the Statement on the DefenceEstimates 1980 hold equally true today.    The threat, ourstarting-point, is ever present: heightened in some areas,unabated in others.    The most effective and economical wayfor Britain to meet it is still through collective deterrenceachieving collective security.    We need not, therefore,rehearse here the basic principles of defence policy speltout in last year&apos;s Statement.    We shall focus Instead on thechanging global conditions in whLch those prune 1. pl.e:i have bobe developed and applied.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL1.      DEFENCE POLICY IN A CHANGING WORLD101. The past year has seen, in Britain and the West generally,a fresh upsurge of interest and concern over defence.    A seriesof international crises in which Western interests - and sometime:;Western citizens - were closely involved has created a newsense of risk.    The decisions which   the Government has takenon British defence have attracted lively attention and debate.Some have argued that we are doing too much: aggravating thedangers rather than helping to avert them.    Others, with an eye tothreats both inside and outside the NATO area, have argued thatwe are doing too little.    The argument in each case turns on twofactors: the degree of challenge with which the outsideworld faces us, and the part that it is proper for Britain toplay in meeting that challenge.    This chapter explains theGovernment&apos;s general view on both points.102. The Government deplores the idea of an arm3 race, and inparticular a nuclear arms race.    We and our aLlies seek to providesecurity at the lowest and least costly level of forces we can.In all our countries there are other social expenditure programmeswhich have legitimate and pressing claims on our limited resource-:and on which we 3hould like to 3pend more.    We do not wish toaggravate an international climate of suspicion and mistruct.It is our aim therefore to negotiate arms control agreementswherever possible (see paragraphs 119-125), while at the 3ame timemaintaining forces sufficient in size and quality to deterany level of aggression.    In determining this sufficiency wecannot ignore the build-up of Soviet forces and the proven1.1CONFIDENTIAL
C ONPIDEN TIALwillingness of Soviet leaders to use them in an expansionistway and regardless of international opinion*Developments in the Threat103. The scale of the Soviet military build-up and its potencyis illustrated by some sample production figuresfor 1980.   The equipment turned out by Soviet industry in thatyear included!- some 250 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs)- over 1300 combat aircraft- over 400 military helicopters- over 3000 tanks- 5 major surface ships- at least 9 nuclear-powered submarines- 4 conventional submarines.There is also a huge and growing space programme mainly formilitary purposes.   The Soviet Union launches some 100 satelliteseach year, roughly three times as many as the rest of theworld.104. Despite growing economic problems the Soviet Unioncontinues to devote enormous effort to strengthening its armedforces.    The Soviet government publishes no credible figures fordefence spending, but Western estimates indicate that itrose in real terms by some 4 per cent per year throughoutthe 1970s and now absorbs around 12-14 per cent of1.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALGross National Product (GNP). Weestimate that actual Soviet defence expenditure in recent yearscontrasts with published figures as follows:1978 1979 1980 ,Soviet published figures   17.23 17.23 17.12Estimated actual expen-     73-78 76-81 81-86diturein billions of current roublesMaintenance and personnel costs are relatively low in the Sovietarmed forces and the budget is dominated by equipment procurement.About 40$ of defence expenditure goes to procure     new weapons systemsand about -a further 20$ orr R..&amp; D - the latter being double thecorresponding percentage in the United States and half as muchagain as in the United Kingdom.    Even if we assume a Soviet pro-pensity to over-insure,this effort still goes much beyond whatcould objectively be seen as necessary for defence.105. It is the association of immense military power with ahostile and expansionist ideology which makes the Soviet Uniona potential threat to the West.   Marxist-Leninist ideology stilldetermines Soviet official attitudes.    The Soviet leadershipcontinually reaffirms its adherence to the teachings of Lenin,whose recurring theme is the inevitable triumph of communism overcapitalism.    The West need have nothing to fear from peacefulcompetition with the Soviet Union.   We can be confident of theinternational appeal both of our political and ethical traditions, andof   our economic and technological achievements. Experiencesuggests, however, that we cannot be confident the Soviet Unionwill be content with peaceful competition.106. We still have no reason to believe that Soviet leaders arespecifically planning to attack NATO.   Nevertheless   they have a largeand growing military and naval capacity for offensive use; they areplainly ready to apply force in support of political aims, eitherdirectly or indirectly; and they aim to be confident of successfully1.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALsurviving - with their Party, State and military structure stillfunctioning - from any possible war between East and West. Thepotential threat to NATO&apos;s own territory that this combination ofcapability and attitudes implies remains the main challenge withwhich the defence policies of the Alliance and its members must content107. It is difficult to judge how, in the decade ahead, Sovietambitions - and willingness to pursue them by force - will betranslated into action.    The Soviet leadership will have problems ofits own to face: internal economic difficulties, problems in EasternEurope, and the &quot;imminent need for changes in the leadership itself.These factors could make for greater caution in external policy.Alternatively - and depending not least on the stand the West itselftakes - they could make adventurism outside Europe look increasinglytempting.    But some features of Soviet worldwide policy remain constantIts aim is to exploit unrest in the world to Soviet advantage, andformidable military power lies at its disposal to support that aim.The elements in Soviet defence capability which lend it a worldwidedimension are discussed in paragraphs 303-5 and illustrated inFigure 1.108. Military capability can also be a weapon of political influence,intimidation and blackmail, whether outside or inside Europe(as recent Soviet activity on the borders of Poland has shown).Our objective in the European theatre is thus to deter not only thedirect use of force but also other uses of Soviet military powerwhich could bring unacceptable pressures to bear on the politicaland economic life of free Western states.    The same analysis holdsgood for other regions.    The Soviet Union has already shown thatit possesses massive military force, and is prepared to use it fornational advantage.    The invasion of Afghanistan has been prolonged,in the face of repeated worldwide protest,  into a callous occupation;1.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthe Soviet Union has still made no serious move to withdraw itstroops and let the Afghan people decide their own destiny.   But thisis only one of a number of options open to the Soviet leadership forthe application of military power.    Their alternative - and generallypreferred - techniques include the use of allies and surrogates,like the Cubans in Africa and the Caribbean; active encouragementof disruptive elements in pro-Western or non-aligned states; andthe various methods of covert subversion.    The West cannot ignorethese activities, since they directly threaten internationalstability and secure lines of communication, upon which we dependin a way the Soviet Union does not, not only for supply of rawmaterials but also to market our products.The Worldwide Dimension in Western Strategy109. The global challenge to Western interests has loomed largein discussions on security during the past year. It would bewrong to let it either overshadow the threat in NATO&apos;s own area,or project an over-simplified pattern of East-West antagonism onthe wider world.    Disturbance anywhere, of any origin, offers theSoviet Union fresh opportunities to exploit.   But the causes ofinstability in different states and regions are complex, oftenowing more to long-standing local rivalries and racial, religiousand political tensions than to any outside stimulus.    The hostili-ties between Iraq and Iran (see paragraph 413) have shown whatproblems can be posed for the West by a conflict in no way provokedby the Soviet Union.110. A Western counter-strategy must take full account of thesecomplexities.    Defence measures alone are not enough. Theymust be integrated with other Western actions, political andeconomic, designed to remove sources of conflict and strengthen the1.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALfoundations of our   cooperation with the developing world. Theymust recognise the rights and views of our local partners, whowill wish to take prime responsibility for their own defence.At the same time   the West must find a way to deter thepotentially damaging uses of Soviet and Soviet-backed militarypower   and to demonstrate its resolve to defend essentialinterests.    The Government sees the best way of reconciling theserequirements in a three-fold application of Western defenceresources.    The first element consists of defence aid toindependent states, in the form of equipment sales, loan personnel,,training, and advice, to help them bear the burden of their own andtheir regions* security.    The second is periodic deployment of theWest&apos;s own forces to strategically important areas, for exercises,visits and training.    The third is the ability to deploy thoseforces for deterrent   or defensive action where circumstancesmake this necessary in the last resort.111. The overall threat concerns all Western nations in varyingdegrees.    The United States has declared its resolve, which theGovernment warmly welcomes, to bring its resources to bear wherevernecessary.    The United Kingdom will do what it can to support theseefforts in accordance with the principles set out above. (SeeChapter 4.)   Other NATO nations, and friendly powers such asAustralia and New Zealand, also have historical links and militaryand economic resources which can usefully be brought to bear. Theresponse can often be made more effective and cost-effective bycooperation among the Western countries involved and with the localstates whom they seek to help.1.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALChallenge for NATO112. While recognising the global implications of a growing Sovietmilitary capability, we do not forget what is still its main, andfor us most crucial, focus - the drive for dominance in and aroundEurope.    In 1977 NATO Heads of State and Government recognisedthat urgent remedial measures were needed to check growingimbalances between the forces of the Warsaw Pact and those ofNATO.   They agreed then to aim at real increases in defenceexpenditure in the region of 3$ per year, and the Long TermDefence Programme (LTDP) was put in hand.    (See Chapter 3.)113. NATO remains the essential framework of Western defence andthe key to the United Kingdom&apos;s own national security.    It wouldbe a grave mistake for NATO to ignore collective security in itsown Treaty area while its members work for the security of regionsfurther afield.    The area set out in the North Atlantic Treaty,within which NATO&apos;s fundamental commitments apply, will not beextended.   But NATO can help to meet its members&apos; concern abouttheir wider strategic interests.    It offers a forum in which theycan discuss such concerns and develop common approaches to them.Moreover, it must cope with any implications for its own area ofresponsibility, not just from the wider threat but also from theeffort its members are making outside NATO* s area.114. NATO has been active in these respects throughout the pastyear.   Allied Ministers discussed &quot;out-of-area&quot; issues at theirmeetings during 1980.    They concluded that it was right forcountries which had the ability to do so to work for stabilityoutside the NATO area   and that such efforts should wherepossible be coordinated.1.7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL115. Afghanistan threw into sharper relief the need for aconcerted allied effort within the NATO area.    The plans for aRapid-Deployment Joint Task Force (RDJTF) developed by the United States jresponse to the out-of-area threat do not involve the withdrawalof any American ground or air forces permanently stationed inEurope.    But they do affect the potential availability ofreinforcements and maritime forces; and Ministers recognised atthe NATO Defence Planning Committee (DPC) meeting in December 1980that &quot;making good such deficiencies was a legitimate responsibilityof the European allies&quot;.    Work has already been set in hand on theassociated tasks, including a two-phased programme of short andmedium-term measures to improve Alliance defences.   NATO has thustaken its share in shaping a Western response to the extended threat.Despite inherent differences in national starting-points   we havemade, and will continue to make, progress in the Alliance towardsa common conception both of the threat outside Europe and of therole that individual allies should play in responding to it.116. The other main theme of discussion in NATO over the last yearhas been the broad pattern of collective defence .The need for the UnitedStates and some other allies to shoulder responsibilities outsideEurope has revived long-standing questions about the balance ofeffort within NATO between the United States and 1ne rest, and among thevarious European allies.    It has also focussed attention on hostnation support within European countries for the growing numberof rapid-reinforcement forces earmarked for the European theatreby the US.    In tackling these issues in the coming year it isright to recall that of the ready forces currently available inEurope (including the French), some 90$ of the ground forces and75$ of the air forces already come from the European countries,as do 75$ of the tanks and more than 90$ of the armoured divisions.1.8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALEuropean countries provide a similarly high proportion of theready naval forces in the Eastern Atlantic and Channel.117. The division of effort among the European allies is amatter of particular importance for British defence policy. Wemake a national contribution in four separate roles, and in presenteconomic circumstances we need to concentrate our expenditure withineach role where it will be most cost-effective both for us and forNATO as a whole.    Judgements about this should as far as possible bemade in the context of Alliance patterns of joint effort.118. NATO&apos;s success in sustaining an adequate and up-to-datedefence programme depends on its resilience and flexibility asa structure as well as on the attitudes of its individual members.In 1980 one very welcome event on both counts was the returnof Greece to the integrated military structure.    Besides strengtheningthe key Southern Flank this was a tribute both to the determinationof Greece and Turkey to strengthen Alliance cohesion and to theirstatesmanlike attitude to their national differences.Arms Control119. The international confidence essential for progress inarms control has been damaged by the events of the past eighteen monthsand       in particular by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.Nevertheless the Government still regards the pursuit of armscontrol and disarmament agreements as an important element of itssecurity policy.   We will continue to work to achieve suchagreements wherever there are prospects for reducing therisks of conflict and allowing our defence to be guaranteed ata lower level of effort and cost.    The United Kingdom has1.9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALparticipated actively over the last year in the negotiations onMutual and Balanced Force Reductions in Central Europe (MBFR),on a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and in theReview Conferences of the nuclear Non-proliferation Treatyand the Biological Weapons Convention, for both of which we arejoint depositories.    We have consistently supported effortsfor strategic arms limitations between the United States andthe Soviet Union.    We have played a full part in the 40-nationCommittee on Disarmament, including the discussions it hassponsored on chemical weapons arms control.    We will continueto do so during 1981 and in the preparations for the secondUnited Nations Special Session on Disarmament planned for 1982.120. The Government&apos;s guiding principle in all these negotiationsis realism.    The uncertainty today in East-West relations is not areason to relax our efforts for worthwhile arms control agree-ments; but it does highlight the constraints on what armscontrol alone can achieve.   Progress in arms control negotiationsmay help to improve the East-West climate, but it cannot transformthe basic political attitudes which lie at the roots of tension.121. This reasoning is fundamental, among other things, to theGovernment&apos;s position on unilateral nuclear disarmament. (Seepage  ~   J on Nuclear Weapons and Preventin War.)    There is no reasonat all to think that British renunciation of nuclear arms wouldsignificantly alter the views either of those states which maintainor of those which might consider acquiring, their own nuclear weaponsIt would achieve nothing except to weaken our ability to deter aggression in the face of the continuing nuclear and conventional threat.1.10CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL122.. More generally   the Government sees little merit in sweepingdeclarations on arms control  that   gloss over realities such asthe wide differences between problems in Europe and those elsewhere.Only painstaking negotiation   on specific problems can achievebalanced and verifiable arms control agreements which can enhanceour security.   Verification is always a difficulty, given theclosed nature of the societies in the Warsaw Pact.    Yet it isindispensable if we are not to gamble with our security; compliancewith the negotiated terms cannot simply be taken on trust. Theselessons have been clearly illustrated in our recent experience ofspecific negotiations.123. In the talks on Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions (MBFR)the maj or impediment to progress continues to be the wide discre-pancy between Eastern statements and Western estimates of the sizeof Eastern forces in Central Europe and the failure of the East toco-operate in resolving this problem over the facts.   Another exampleof the Alliance&apos;s approach to arms control concerns long-rangetheatre nuclear forces (LRTNF).    As explained in Chapter Two,the SovietUnion began by rejecting the United States&apos; offer of negotiations butthen modified its position and agreed to talk.    The Alliance&apos;srefusal to be deflected from its own LRTNF modernisation while theSoviet build-up continued was crucial in bringing about the changein Soviet attitudes which enabled US/Soviet talks to begin inOctober 1980.124* The. United Kingdom made-a major contribution at the -UN- Conferenceon Inhumane Weapons in 1980 by tabling, with the Netherlands, thedraft on which the Convention eventually adopted was based.    We alsohelped to secure protocols containing new restrictions on the use ofcertain weapons,  such as mines and incendiaries, against civiliantargets.    This agreement represents a worthwhile advance inhumanitarian law.1.11CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALI125. The second Review Meeting of the Conference on Securityand Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) began in Madrid on 11 November1980.    The first phase of the meeting concentrated on a review ofthe implementation by all CSCE signatories of the provisions ofthe Helsinki Final Act signed in 1975.    At the end of the firstphase   France tabled an important proposal concerning securityin Europe.    This provides for the negotiation of militarilysignificant, binding, verifiable Confidence-Building Measures(CBMs) applicable to the whole of Europe.    These CBMs would goconsiderably beyond the five,largely voluntary CBMs embodied inthe Helsinki Final Act.    Such new CBMs represent a differentconcept of arms control from that adopted in most othernegotiations: they focus principally on making more open theactivities of military forces,and on thereby  making it moredifficult to use these forces for aggressive purposes, ratherthan on limiting armaments or the forces themselves.    The Frenchproposal enjoys broad support from the Alliance, including theUnited Kingdom.126. The Government&apos;s responses to the new challenges on theinternational scene   as they affect both defence and arms controlform a coherent whole.    The key point is that the Western Alliancshould maintain its solidarity, its strength and its self-confidence;which in turn requires a continuing frank and thorough exchange ofideas among Allies, and an efficient and fair pooling of respon-sibilities.    A constant effort is needed to assess and adjust tonew circumstances as they arise.    In all this   the Government isdetermined that Britain should play an active, imaginative andconstructive part.1.12CONFIDENTIAL
PART TWOROLESChapters 2 to 4 of this Statement describe the roles performedfeoday by British nuclear and conventional forces in NATO andmore widely.    The picture that emerges is not static. Threatschange with time, as do the factors which influence our choiceof the most rational and cost-effective response.
CONFIDENTIALTl &gt; General Context;   Britain within NATO1. As a sovereign nation we must in the end decide for ourselves whattasks our armed forces should be ready to perform, and how they shouldbe designed to meet them.     But we cannot decide in a vacuum; many hardrealities bear upon our choices.     We have to consider what adversary wemay face, and what his capability is and may become.     We have toconsider what level of resources to set for defence (and also - theother side of the coin - what security risks any such setting implies).And, in an Alliance, we have to consider how our contributions interactwith those of our partners.2. NATO is not a supra-national authority assigning tasks toindividual members as though to subordinates. Its internationalcommanders and staffs seek to influence national choices in the commoninterest; but the pattern of roles has for the most part evolvedgradually among the member nations themselves, by accommodation andadjustment which usually owes more to the interplay of historical,gee-raphieal, economic and political factors than to specificnegotiations or bargains.     The result (of which paragraph  309 givessoma features) is the defence posture of the Alliance.     It is rarelywhat pure strategic theory might suggest; but it reflects a complexCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALstructure of interdependence and confidence which needs subtleunderstanding.3. Britain&apos;s own present pattern of force commitment to the Allianceillustrates this.     Of our four principal roles the nuclear contribu-tion (the least costly) derives from special factors which make us inpractice the only possible European provider.     Direct defence of theUnited Kingdom is a role where we must clearly shoulder the mainburden ourselves, though others may help.      We make the main Europeancontribution to Alliance maritime effort   and are well fitted to do so,In purely historical terms our stationing of major land and air forceson the Continent is the least obviously natural of our roles; yet thisvery fact gives it special significance.     Beyond its direct militaryimportance in protecting a key sector of front covering the Alliance&apos;sheartland, it expresses and guarantees the full commitment of ournational effort (including our nuclear capability) to the collectivesecurity of our key European allies   as inseparable from our own.4. It is unreal to suppose that the United Kingdom could safely orsensibly abandon any of these roles.     Talk of choosing in somesimple or exclusive way between, say, a &quot;maritime&quot; and a &quot;Continental&quot;effort is misconceived.     We must, however, shape our future contribu-tion to the four roles in a world of shifting military, politicaleconomic and technological pressures.5. The pace of technological advance, with the rising cost ofexploiting it, puts inescapable financial pressure on our defencebudget.     It does not follow that we must be forced out of majorareas of our defence effort, especially as the scale of that effortis ultimately a matter of free political choice, not of economicdeterminism.     But we must take especial care, within each of ourmain roles, to concentrate our expenditure where it will be mostCONFIDENTIAL
__CONFIDENTIAL_truly effective for the Alliance, and this may sometimes meanbard decisions about the content of our programme.The resource pressures we face are common to all members ofthe Alliance.    This, and the fact of interdependence, suggeststhat programme choices should so far as possible be madeconsciously within an Alliance framework.   NATO&apos;s Long TermDefence Programme launched in 1978 was an important step in thisdirection.   But as both the external threat from new challengesand the economic pressures sharpen, there is a case for a furtherand perhaps more radical look at Alliance wide cost-effectiveness.Even now, the Alliance appears to spend in total more than theWarsaw Pact on defence; and while much of the Pact&apos;s cost-effectiveness springs from features such as massive conscriptionand enforced uniformity which we should not wish to emulate, wecannot be complacent about the results.   A willingness to look atraw patterns of joint effort - more far-reaching interdependence,for example, or greater use of the Alliance&apos;s highly developedcivilian resources for logistic support in emergency - may beworthwhile.    The Government would welcome, and will seek toencourage, renewed effort by the Alliance in this generalc .rection. _:_Ji3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALNUCLEAR WEAPONS AND PREVENTING WAR1. Nuclear weapons have transformed our view   of war.Though they have been used only twice, half a lifetime ago,the terrible experience of Hiroshima and Nagasaki must bealways in our minds.    But the scale of that horror makes itall the more necessary that revulsion be partnered by clearthinking.     If it is not, we may find ourselves having tolearn again, in the appalling school of practical experience,that abhorrence of war is no substitute forrealistic plans to prevent it.2. There can be opposing views about whether the worldwould be safer and more peaceful if maclear weapons had neverbeen invented.     But that is academic; they cannot bedisinvented.     Our task now is to devise a system for livingin peace and freedom while ensuring that nuclear weapons arenever used, either to destroy or to blackmail.3. Nuclear weapons are the dominant aspect of modern warpotential.     But they are not the only aspect we should fear.Save at the very end, World War II was fought entirely withwhat are comfortably called &quot;conventional&quot; weapons, yetduring its six years something like fifty   million peoplewere killed.     Since 1945 &quot;conventional&quot; war has killed upto ten million more.     The &quot;conventional&quot; weapons with whichany East/West war would be fought today are much more powerfulthan those of 1939-1945; and chemical weapons are far morelethal than v/hen they were last used widely, over sixtyyears ago.     Action about nuclear weapons which left, orseemed to leave, the field free for non-nuclear war could becalamitous.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4. Moreover, whatever promises might have been given inpeace, no alliance possessing nuclear weapons could becounted on to accept major non-nuclear defeat and conquerwithout using its nuclear power.    Non-nuclear war betweenEast and West is by far the likeliest road to nuclear wa5. We must therefore seek to prevent any war, not justnuclear war, between East and West.     And the part nuclea.weapons have to play in this is made all the greater byfacts of military power.     The combination of geographytotalitarian direction of resources gives the Soviet Uni imassive preponderance in Europe.     The Western democracie.have enough economic strength to match the East, if theirpeoples so chose.       But the cost to social and other aici-.would be huge, and the resulting forces would still notour nuclear weapons unnecessary.     No Western non-nucleareffort could keep us safe against one-sided Eastern nuclea:power.6. An enormous literature has sprung up around the conceof deterrence in the nuclear age.     Much of it seems remoteand abstruse, and its apparent detachment often soundsrepugnant.       But though the idea of deterrence is old andlooks simple, making it work effectively in   today&apos;s worldneeds clear thought on complex issues.      The central aim isto influence the calculations of anyone who might consideraggression; to influence them decisively; and, crucially;influence them before aggression is ever launched.     It isnot certain that any East/West conflict would rise to all-out nuclear war:    escalation is a matter of human decision2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALnot an inexorable scientific process.     It is perfectly-sensible - indeed essential - to make plans which couldincrease and exploit whatever chance there might be of ending var short of global catastrophe.     But that chance will alwaysbe precarious, whether at the conventional or the nuclearlevel; amid the confusion, passions and irrationalities ofwar, escalation must always be a grave danger.     The only safecourse is outright prevention.7.     Planning deterrence means thinking through the possiblereasoning of an adversary and the way in which alternativecourses of action might appear to him in advance.     It alsomeans doing this in his terms, not in ours; and allowing fornow he might think in future circumstances, not just in today&apos;s,-in essence   we seek to ensure that, whatever military aggressionor political bullying a future Soviet leader might contemplate,be could not foresee any likely situation in which the Westwould be left with no realistic alternative to surrender.3.     Failure to recognise this complicated but crucial factabout deterrence - that it rests, like a chess master&apos;sstrategy, on blocking off in advance a variety of possiblemoves in an opponent&apos;s mind -   underlies many of the crit-icisms made of Western security policy.     To make provisionfor having practical courses of action available in nuclearwar (or for reducing its devastation in some degree   by modestcivil defence precautions) is not in the least to have a &quot;war-fighting strategy&quot;, or to plan for nuclear war as somethingexpected or probable.      It is, on the contrary, a necessaryPath to deterrence, to rendering nuclear war as improbable as3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALwe humanly can.     The further evolution last year of UnitedStates nuclear planning illustrates the point.     The reasonfor having available a wider range of &quot;non-city&quot; targetoptions    was not in order to fight a limited nuclear war -the United States repeatedly   stressed that    it   did notbelieve in any such notion - but to help ensure that even ifan adversary believed in limited nuclear war (as Sovietwritings sometimes suggest), he could not expect actually towin one.9.     The United Kingdom helped to develop NATO&apos;s deterrentstrategy, and we are involved in its nuclear aspects at threemain levels.     First, we endorse it fully as helping toguarantee our security, and we share in the protection itgives all Alliance members.     Second, we co operate directly,like several other members, in the United States power whichis the main component of the nuclear armoury, by making basesavailable and providing certain delivery systems to carryUnited States warheads.    Third, we commit to the Alliancenuclear forces of various kinds - strategic and theatre -under our independent control.     The details of all this arematters of debate, which the Government welcomes.     But thedebate should recognise that positions which seek to washBritish hands of nuclear affairs, while continuing (as NATOmembership implies) to   welcome United States nuclear protec-tion through the Alliance, offer neither moral merit norgreater safety.     Whether we like the fact or not, and whethernuclear weapons are based here or not, our country&apos;s size andlocation make it militarily crucial to NATO   and so aninevitable target in war.     A &quot;nuclear-free&quot; Britain wouldhCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALmean a weaker NATO, weaker deterrence, and more risk of war;and if war started we would if anything be more likely, not .less, to come under nuclear attack.10. The East-West peace has held so far for thirty-five years.This is a striking achievement, with political systems sosharply opposed and points of friction potentially so many.No-one can ever prove that deterrence centred on nuclearweapons has played a key part; but common sense suggests thatit must have done.     Deterrence can continue to hold, withgrowing stability as the two sides deepen their understandingof how the system must work and how dangers must be avoided.Not since the Soviet gamble over Cuba in 1962 have v/e comeanywhere near the brink.     It is entirely possible, if weplan wisely, to go on enjoying both peace and freedom - thatis, to avoid the bogus choice of &quot;Red or dead&quot;.11. To recognise the success of deterrence is not to acceptit as the last word in ensuring freedom from war. Anyreadiness by one nation to use nuclear weapons againstanother, even in self-defence, is terrible.     No-one -especially from within the ethical traditions of the freeworld, with their special respect for individual life - canacquiesce comfortably in it as the basis of internationalpeace for the rest of time.     We have to seek unremittingly,through arms control and otherwise, for better ways ofordering the world.      But the search may   be a very long one.No safer system than deterrence is yet in view, andimpatience would be a catastrophic guide in the search. Totear down the present structure,    imperfect but effective,5CONFIDENTIAL

2. NUCLEAR FORCES201. The Statement on the Defence Estimates 1980 explainedthe role of nuclear weapons in NATO&apos;s deterrent strategy,and the   reasons why we continue to contribute independentBritish nuclear forces within the framework of the strategy.In the first major Parliamentary debate on nuclear policyfor fifteen years these issues were discussed in theHouse of Commons on 24 January 1980,   when the Government&apos;sview was supported by a majority of six to one.    Later in1980 two important decisions were taken: the agreementbetween the Prime Minister and the President of theUnited States for the United Kingdom to buy the Tridentmissile system to succeed Polaris in the 1990s; and thechoice of the two locations for the United Kingdom-basedelement of the United States ground-launched cruise missileforce to be introduced from the end of 1983 as partof the programme to modernise NATO&apos;s long-range theatrenuclear forces.The Nuclear Balance202. The Alliance has never sought, at either the conventionalor the nuclear level, to match the Soviet Union and itsallies weapon for weapon.    The aim has been simply to deteraggression, by having enough forces to respond effectivelyto an attack at any level and, if necessary, to raise thelevel of the conflict to make clear NATO&apos;s ability anddetermination to go on resisting.    But the growing disparityin certain areas between NATO and Soviet nuclear strength,CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALand the increasing vulnerability of some of NATO 1solder systems to the modern Soviet weapons now beingmassively deployed, must cause concern.203. The United States and the Soviet Union have continuedto observe the provisions of SALT I and the unratifiedSALT II agreement.    The new United States Administration hasindicated that it wishes to see the SALT process continue andis at present reviewing its policy in this area. TheBritish Government strongly supports the continuation oftalks.    There has been some adjustment of forces withinthe SALT II limits:    for example, by replacing SS9and some SS11 with SS17, 18 and 19 missiles the SovietUnion has   now almost reached the permitted ceiling of820 MIRVed ICBMs (inter-continental ballistic missiles withmultiple independently targetable   re-entry vehicles).Nevertheless   the situation at this level remains one ofbroad parity, with the advantage of the United Statesin terms of numbers of warheads offset by that of theSoviet Union in missile throw-weight.204. Among systems of types not yet covered by SALT,the marked disparity noted in last year&apos;s Statement haswidened with the continuing deployment of new Sovietweapons.    The imbalance is particularly marked in land-basedlong-range weapons; additional SS20 missiles continue to bedeployed at a rate of more than one a week, and Backfirebombers at thirty a year.      Comparison of shorter-rangeweapons is difficult because most delivery systemson both sides are dual-capable - they can carry eitherconventional or nuclear warheads.    We do not know preciselyhow many nuclear warheads the Soviet Union has availableX .2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALfor use by its theatre systems; but the Soviet Union producesand refurbish well over a thousand warheads each year forits combined strategic and theatre weapon stockpiles,fhe numbers of nuclear delivery systems currently deployedby the Soviet Union and NATO (including France) at thestrategic level and within the European theatre are shownin Figure 2.2.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL205. Simple numerical presentation cannot provide acomplete picture.    It cannot reflect such factors assystem   performance and age, nor the accuracy, number,or yields of warheads.    Some systems, such as aircraft,can carry different numbers of warheads in different roles,and many, including some missile launchers, can be re-used.But however the figures are presented, it is clear thatwhile there is broad parity between West and East ininter-continental systems there is a wide and growingdisparity in the European theatre.Trident206. When the Governmentsdecision to buy Trident from theUnited States was announced on 15 July the Ministry ofDefence published a Memorandum on the Future United KingdomStrategic Nuclear Deterrent Force.     This explained not onlythe strategic background and the main considerationsaffecting the choice of system, but also which options hadbeen examined and why Trident was clearly the right choiceamong them.207. The crucial role which our nuclear forces play inenhancing Alliance security lies in providing a nucleardeterrent capability committed to the Alliance yet fullyunder the control of a European member.     Even if in somefuture situation Soviet leaders imagined thatthe United States might not be prepared to use nuclearweapons, having to take account of enormous destructivepower in European hands would compel them to regard therisks of aggression in Europe as still very grave. Thisadditional element of insurance - the &quot;second centre ofdecision&quot; - has been a feature of Alliance deterrence forover twenty five years.       ^ ^CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL&apos;In practice no other member is in a position to provide this,and its importance has been repeatedly recognised by ourAllies- most recently, and very clearly,in the November 1980communique of NATO&apos;s Nuclear Planning Group.     To give up ourdistinctive capability now or to let its effectiveness fadeaway, whether as a deliberate act of unilateral disarmamentor simply to save money, would be to abandon not a marginalcapability but a central and unique component of our contribu-tion to the Alliance.     This would be a particularly strangeact at a time when Soviet power relative to the West&apos;s isgreater than ever before, and still growing.208. To be a credible deterrent   our strategic nuclear forcesmust meet certain standards.     They must clearly be underultimate United Kingdom control.     They must be capable ofposing a convincing threat - of inflicting, on key aspects ofSoviet state power, damage which any Soviet leadership wouldregard as out of all proportion to any likely gains fromaggression against us.     It must be maintained at a high stateof readiness,, invulnerable to surprise attack.     The examina-tion of options for replacing Polaris also had to take account oftimescale (it would become increasingly difficulty expensive andoperationally uncertain to maintain the Polaris force beyondthe early 1990s) and of cost.209. The studies which led up to the Government&apos;s decisionconsidered various possible launch platforms: sea-based(surface ships or submarines), airborne and land-based. Thefactors were reviewed at length in the Ministry of DefenceMemorandum.     Briefly, the choice to continue with nuclear-propelled, ocean-going submarines was dictated essentially by1. 5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthe need for invulnerability; other platforms would need tobe deployed in large numbers and difficult operationalpatterns to give high assurance of surviving sudden attack.The choice of delivery vehicle lay between cruise andballistic missiles.     The former at present cost less each,but much larger numbers are needed for a given level ofdeterrent threat; and the long-term development of Sovietdefences against them is very hard to predict.     In addition,cruise missiles would need more submarines (the most expensivesingle component of the force).     In short, a cruise missileforce would be less certain and more costly than a ballisticmissile force.210. Of the ballistic missiles considered, Trident had clearadvantages on both operational and cost grounds.     Trident isa formidable and proven system now in service with the UnitedStates Navy.    Other possibilities, such as further modernisingPolaris, would entail costly and uncertain developmentprogrammes and result in systems unique to the United Kingdom,The agreement of the United States   Government to provide theTrident system   maintains the highly successful cooperationwe have had on Polaris.     Trident will be bought on broadlythe same mutually advantageous terms, and complete with itsMIRV capability.   We will therefore still have the benefit of con moality with a tried and tested high-technology system. Aswith Polaris, the United Kingdom will provide its ownwarheads.     The exchange of letters between the Prime Ministerand President Carter in July 1980 (Cmnd 7979) established thebasic undertaking for the sale of the missiles.     A furtherexchange of letters between the tv/o Governments onisCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL30 September 1980 extended the provisions of the 1963Polaris Sales Agreement to cover the supply of Trident.Although, as with Polaris, we shall rely on the UnitedStates for such items as spares, technical information,training assistance and range facilities, the force will beentirely under the control of the United Kingdom Government.Like Polaris it will be committed to NATO save in a situationwhere our supreme national interests are   at stake.211. Various studies are already in hand; on the design of thesubmarines, the precise number of missiles required (includingallowance for spares, trials and test firings) and maintenanceand support facilities. No decision is needed yeton the option of building a fifth boat.The total capital cost of a four-boat forceis broadly estimated at  5000   million (at mid-1980 prices).When the studies are complete, however, a more precise estimatewill be possible of the cost and how it will be spread. Atpresent we expect the expenditure to extend over fifteen years,reaching a peak in the late 1980s.     Between 1980 and 1995 itis not likely to absorb more than about ~5% of the defencebudget on average, and about 5&apos;&gt; in the peak years (includingabout 8;&lt; of the equipment part of the defence budget). About70% of the cost will be spent in the United Kingdom.212. The cost of Trident will clearly be a major item in thedefence programme, particularly towards the end of the 1980s.The strategic nuclear force is however an integral part of oursecurity effort in support of the Alliance.     A judgement hasto be made about the resources to be devoted to each aspectof this effort.      The proportion of our budget allocated to1.7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthe strategic nuclear force has varied over the past twenty-five years between about 2% and about 10$.    Even alongsidethe continuing running costs of Polaris (about        of thebudget) the Trident programme thus involves no dramatic changein the allocation of our defence resources.     Once thesystem is in service it will, like the Polaris force, be veryeconomical both in running costs and in its demands onskilled Service manpower.213. The Government has made it clear that the provision ofthe Trident force will not prevent continued improvement inother areas of the United Kingdom&apos;s contribution to NATO.Money spent on   Trident is money not spent elsewhere, but noalternative use of resources would provide a comparablestrengthening of the collective security of the Alliance.As long as the Warsaw Pact continues to deploy both massiveconventional forces and large numbers of strategic andtheatre nuclear weapons, NATO deterrence needs adequate defencecapabilities at every level.     The United Kingdom nuclearcontribution plays a distinctive role in this;    the decisionto procure Trident will enable it to continue to do so wellinto the next century.CHEVALINE214. Trident will not enter service until the early 1990s.Meanwhile we must keep the Polaris force effective in thestrategic environment of the 1980s.     The 1980 Statement onthe Defence Estimates described the Chevaline programme toimprove the front end of the Polaris missile   in response toSoviet anti-ballistic missile capabilities,which we know arebeing improved.    Chevaline   is a highly complex developmentcosting some  1 billion, and includes advanced penetration aidsand a manoeuvrable payload.      It is a United Kingdom programme1. 8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALand most of the work has been done in Britain, although someUnited States contractors have been used and the UnitedStates Government has given full   cooperation. Developmentwork is near to completion and Chevaline will enter serviceshortly thereafter.Theatre Nuclear Force Modernisation215. NATO has for many years had land-based theatre nuclearforces, capable of long-range strike   yet separate from the mainintercontinental armouries. Technical and strategic argumentsfor having a capability of this kind as part of NATO&apos;sdeterrent power have grown in importance as Soviet strength -especially at this level - has mounted. For the past decadeNATO&apos;s capability has been provided by United States F.111sand Royal Air Force Vulcans, all based in England. Theseaircraft are ageing; the rundown of Vulcan, indeed, hasalready begun, and its replacement, the Tornado, is ofshorter range.     The current aircraft would have increasingdifficulty in penetrating Soviet anti-aircraft defences, whichare massive in scale and constantly improving.     And theydepend upon fixed airfields, which accurate enemy systemscan strike.    This last point gives heightened significance tothe long-planned, continuing and widespread deployment ofpowerful modern Soviet systems like the SS20 and Backfire.216. For the Alliance to have done nothing - simply to have acquiesced inthe progressive erosion of a long-standing and importantelement of its strength - would have been seriously damagingto the Alliance&apos;s ability to deter the Soviet Union from think-ing that it could fight and win a nuclear war confined toEurope.      The member countries discussed the problem2-9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALextensively and reached a broadly-based collective view.On 12 December 1979 NATO Ministers decided that two paralleland complementary approaches were needed.     One approachinvolved a programme to modernise the Alliance&apos;s forcesby introducing 464 ground-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles(GLCMs) and 108 Pershing   II ballistic missiles (replacing108 Pershing Is) in a number of European countries. Thesecond approach involved an offer by the United States, withthe full support of the Alliance, to begin negotiations withthe Soviet Union as soon as possible about limiting land-basedlong-range theatre nuclear forces.     At the same time theUnited States announced its intention to withdraw unilaterally1000 warheads from its nuclear stockpile in Europe, and towithdraw further warheads   on a one-for-one basis as the newmissile&apos;s are deployed.     Action has gone forward in all theseareas during the past year.217. On 17 June 1980 the Government announced that the 160cruise missiles to be based in the United Kingdom would belocated at the RAF bases at Greenham Common in Berkshire (6flights totalling 9c missiles) and Molesworth in Cambridgeshire(4 flights, 64 missiles).     Greenham Common will be the firstsite to become operational; the first missiles should bedeployed there by the end of 1983.     To ensure that the baseis ready in time preliminary work has now begun there, andthe main construction work should start later this year.Molesworth is scheduled to come later in the NATOprogramme; missiles will not be deployed there before about1988 and construction work will not start for some years.21S. The cost of GLCM and Pershing II development andproduction   totalling  5,000M,is being met entirely by the10CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALUnited States, who will also deploy and operate the systems.Much of the cost of constructing the bases will, however, bemet from the NATO infrastructure budget, to which all thenations within NATO&apos;s integrated military structure contribute.The United Kingdom&apos;s share of the total European programme,including the sites in England, will be about  16 million; inaddition we shall provide some 220 personnel as a contributionto the security forces at the United Kingdom bases.     As withother United States nuclear weapons which have been based inthe United Kingdom (and indeed elsev/here in Europe) for manyyears, authorisation for the release of the missiles must begiven by the President of the United States; but under verylong-standing arrangements, the use of the United Kingdom basesin an emergency would be a matter for joint decision by HerMajesty&apos;s Government and the Government of the United Statesin the light of the circumstances prevailing at the time.219. GLCM development is proceeding satisfactorily.    So farthere have been over 50 test firings of Tomahawkin various modes, and over 80$ have been successful,a high figure for an advanced weapon system at this stage ofdevelopment.     As usual with a programme of this complexity,some problems have been encounteredj but these are notexpected to delay the planned date for the initial deployment.220. The GLCMs and Pershing lis will be mobile, and in timeof tension they would be quickly and widely dispersed andconcealed away from their normal bases.     This will be practisedin peacetime, but without live warheads or fuelled missiles.Once dispersed they will be virtually impossible for an enemyto locate and attack, and there will be no point in striking the2.11CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALplaces they have left.     Far from attracting a pre-emptivestrike, therefore, they will help deter any such strike onother more vulnerable forces and facilities.     At the sametime they will not themselves pose any threat of pre-emptivestrike against Soviet capability;    they will be both too fewand too slow in flight for that, and Soviet systems such as theSS20 are themselves mobile.LRTNF ARMS CONTROL221. In response to the United States offer to negotiate aboutlimitations on long range theatre nuclear weapons the Sovietleaders initially refused to talk unless the Alliance firstabandoned its modernisation programme (though they made nosuggestion of abandoning their own much larger and furtheradvanced programme).     They maintained this line for severalmonths, until it became clear to them that the Alliance wasnot prepared to make such a one-sided concession. FollowingChancellor Schmidt&apos;s visit to Moscow in June 1980 the SovietUnion agreed to begin talks, and useful first exchanges tookplace in Geneva in October 1980.     Given the already substantialpreponderance of Soviet long-range theatre nuclear forces,however, it is clear that we cannot achieve a reasonableagreement by giving the Soviet leaders what they want in advance.If we are to induce them to negotiate seriously NATO mustcontinue with its plans to implement the modernisationprogramme.222. The withdrawal of the 1,000 warheads from the United Statesstockpile in Europe begun in the spring of 1980        has nowbeen completed.% .12CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALShorter-Range Systems223. In addition to the Polaris and Vulcan forces the UnitedKingdom contributes a number of other nuclear capable systemsto NATO&apos;s deterrent forces.     These comprise four squadronsof Jaguars and five squadrons of Buccaneers based in theUnited Kingdom and Germany.     All these can deliver eitherconventional weapons or British free-fall nuclear bombs.Over the next few years   the Tornado will replace the  Vulcans and three of the Buccaneer squadrons.     We alsooperate, afloat and ashore, various maritime helicopterscapable of delivering Britishnuclear depth-bombs.     The first two embarked Sea Harriersquadrons,soon to be operating from the anti-submarinecarriers, will also be capable of delivering free-fall nuclearbombs.     All these weapons are assigned to NATO, althoughfinal authority for their release remains with the UnitedKingdom Government.     In addition we operate four squadronsof Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft based in the United Kingdomand equipped with United States nuclear depth-bombs; and oneregiment of Lance missiles and three regiments of dualcapable artillery all based in the Federal Republic of Germanyand equipped with United States warheads.     The United Statesnuclear warheads for these weapons are provided under &quot;dual-key&quot; arrangements - that is, arrangements on the establishedNATO pattern whereby the    cooperation of both thoseproviding the warhead and those providing the delivery systemis needed if the forces are to be used.2. 13CONFIDENTIAL

The value of Britain&apos;s nuclear forces lies less in theirrelative numerical size - they represent only a small fractionof the arsenal of the super-powers - than in their deterrenteffect as a major complicating factor for Soviet calculationV/e maintain a range of modern nuclear forces, geared to NAT(strategy of flexible response and capable of inflicting suchdamage on the Soviet Union that Soviet leaders must take thuinto account.     The Government is convinced that its decisionsto acquire the Trident system and to   cooperate fully in themodernisation programme for the Alliance&apos;s theatre nuclearforces, while maintaining the other components of ournuclear forces -all at the cost of only a small proportion ofthe defence budget - will sustain thishighly effective part of our contribution to Alliancedeterrence.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL.3. CONVENTIONAL FORCES301. The growth of Soviet nuclear capabilities is matched by asimilarly large and comprehensive build-up in their conventionalforces.   To the numerical superiority they already possess theWarsaw Pact forces in Europe are now adding a formidable rangeand quality of equipment; and given the progress they have alreadymade and the size of the R&amp;D investment they are continuing to make, there are very few areas in which NATO can be confidentof maintaining a qualitative edge.302. The customary presentation of the numerical balance of in-placeforces in Central Europe (see Figure 3) shows the continuing quanti-tative advantage held by the Warsaw Pact.    This presentation cannotreflect the quality or effectiveness of the forceslisted,       but it would not be realistic to suppose that theaddition of these factors   could fully offset thecurrent imbalance.    (The particular difficulties of drawing up amaritime balance are discussed on page  ~      7 together with anew presentation of the balance itself.)303. Key elements of recent Warsaw Pact improvements are:- modern tactical aircraft with sophisticated avionics andimproved weapons,including air-to-surface missiles andelectronic counter-measures;- fast and manoeuvrable tanks (T-64 and T-72) with advancedarmour and high-velocity 125 mm smooth-bore guns;- the Typhoon ballistic missile submarines (SSBN3), which willcarry 20 new solid-propellant strategic nuclear missiles;- the Oscar submarines, which have at least 20 newanti-ship cruise missiles with increased range;(both these types of submarine were launched in 1980 andCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALare bigger than any types in the West)- the Kirov - a 25,000 ton nuclear-powered cruiser- andtwo further first-of-class surface warships.    The firstof another new class of cruiser is expected in 1981.304. Such a list is daunting; but perhaps more worrying for tWest is the accelerating rate at which these improvements aretaking place and the extent to which they reflect an emphasis onthe development of offensive and worldwide capabilities. Forexample, in the Soviet Army new air assault units speciallyorganised for parachute drops or helicopter landings have appearedin the forward area.    The Warsaw Pact also maintains theeffectiveness of its capability for offensive chemical warfare.305. By massive investment in naval shipbuilding and repairfacilities the Soviet Union has in ten years transformed its defensivcoastal force to a deep water navy.    It has new classes of surfaceships (as mentioned above) which are largely offensive in conceptand are capable of worldwide operations.    In the air the character 0forces has also changed dramatically.    Ten years ago the Soviet TactAir Force provided air defence and close support for ground fo. ce options.Today,though its defensive capability has bean retained ani enhanced, ther have {been wholesale improvements in its potential for offensive ope -at ionIt now has longer-range ground-attack fighter-bombers carryingheavier payloads; moreover its growing inventory of heavily armedattack and assault helicopters and       integral air defences forground forces releases high-performance aircraft for longer-rangetasks.Allied Defence306. NATO&apos;s nuclear strength helps to counter the challenge posed Wthese conventional forces, but it cannot do so alone. If we are todetiCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALpotential adversary from initiating either nuclear or conventionalwar, the defensive threat we pose needs not only striking power butalso a credible likelihood of use if needed.307. The Alliance therefore aims to possess a range of defensiveresponses essentially as wide as the range of offensive optionsopen to our potential adversaries.    This does not mean that NATOmust match the Warsaw Pact weapon for weapon,  either in typesor in numbers.    The NATO armoury is designed to supply the meansof checking the threat, not the means of emulating it.    It mustreflect our forces&apos; own, defensive, role, not mirror that of anaggressor.    &quot;Flexible response&quot;, which in 1967 replaced the earlier&quot;trip-wire&quot; strategy of massive nuclear retaliation, has, however,inevitably thrown more emphasis on the maintenance of effectiveconventional forces.308. The concept of flexible response is complemented by that&quot;of forward defence.    The stationing of forces well forward in Europegives the clearest evidence, both to the Warsaw Pact and to NATO&apos;sown European members, of the Alliance&apos;s determination and commitmentto defend the whole of NATO territory.    Since several nationscontribute to these forward forces they also demonstrate clearlythe collective nature of the allied defence effort (see Figure5 )       and the fundamental NATO principle that each member enjoysthe protection of the combined armed strength of all the members.309. The current pattern of allied force deployment in all major theatresreflects this collective responsibility.    Thus in Federal Germanythe United Kingdom provides some 55,000 men   in four armoured divisionsand one artillery division,    as part of the Central Region forceswhich also include    some 155,000 regulars and 180,000 conscriptsfrom the Federal German Army, about 200,000 US Army personnel andCONFIDENTIAL33
CONFIDENTIALabout 80,000 from the armies of Belgium, Canada and the NetherlandsAs part of NATO&apos;s Second Allied Tactical Air Force the Royal /\,irForce has 11 fast-jet squadrons and a helicopter squadron bas.id  in Germany; the Federal German Air Force contributes 23 combatsquadrons to the Second and the Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force, jwell as four squadrons in the Baltic Approaches; and the US 17thAir Force is divided between Germany and the Netherlands; BelgiumCanada and the Netherlands also provide air force contributions.In the EASTLANT area of naval operations the United Kingdom providisome 70$ of the ready forces and operates alongside forces fromDenmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Portugal.    The United KingdomBelgium and Netherlands also assign ships to the Allied Commander-,in-Chief Channel (CINCHAH) and the United Kingdom and Netherlandsassign Marine units to the United Kingdom/Netherlands AmphibiousForce under SACLANT.310. Certain of these forces are under NATO command all the time,notably air defence fighter aircraft, missiles and radars, andthe Standing Naval Force Atlantic, to which nine countries contritoships.    In peacetime most NATO forces remain under national commanionly in time of tension or war coming under the direct command of (major NATO commander (Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR),Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT) or CINCHAN).FORCE PLANNING311. To give maximum value to the Alliance, national maritime,ground and air contributions need to be shaped through a centralcoordinating process.    NATO&apos;s force planning procedure is designedto meet this need.    It takes account of the Alliance&apos;s overamilitary requirements, of advances in science and technology and o.available resources.    It considers the spread of military effort a!NATO members in the light of financial and political factors and  CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALrecommendations on force structures and military objectives fora five-year period (&quot;Force Goals&quot;),which should guide Alliancemembers in forming their national plans.    The nations then reachtheir own decisions on the size and scope of their contributions.They report annually their performance against the targets setby NATO, and their reports are considered by NATO Ministers. Thereview process is shown at Figure 6.312. NATO keeps its planning procedures flexible enough to allowfor new initiatives and special improvements in capabilities. TheLong Term Defence Programme (LTDP) agreed in 1978   and describedin last year&apos;s Statement   was just such an initiative.   Many LTDPmeasures have now been translated into Force Goals.   We haveincorporated in our national plans the great majority of themeasures which the  LTDP addressed to us.   NATO&apos;s planning hasalso been adapted recently to incorporate the Phase I and Phase IImeasures agreed following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.313. Given the multinational nature of the forces available toNATO, it makes good economic sense for support facilities to beconstructed and used on an international basis.    The InfrastructureFund, to which all nations   (including France for certain categoriesof work) contribute, has financed common-user projects. Majorelements of the Infrastructure Programme include:- improvement and hardening of airfields;- establishment of a NATO Pipeline System some 6,000 kilometreslong;- development of an integrated communications system;- the coordinated early warning system known as the NATOAir Defence Ground Environment;- automation of the joint maritime headquarters at Northwood.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL314. There are   of course   many other ways in which the Alliancenations co-ordinate their defence efforts.    Alliance forces mustalso practise operating together.   NATO gives a high priority tointernational exercises such as the SPEARPOLNT element of theCRUSADER 80 exercise, described in paragraph     323,      and theconcurrent major maritime exercise TEAMWORK.    Other examples ofNATO exercises are at Annex A.UNITED KINGDOM ROLES315. The remainder of this Chapter looks at Britain&apos;s role inthree geographical sectors and in specialist reinforcement.There is not space to give a full analysis of NATO strength andweakness in each area or to reflect the whole gamut of possibleattack and response.   We attempt, however, to identify the mainabiding features of the threat and of the range of responses ofwhich British forces are capable.The Central Region of EuropeWARSAW PACT FORCES316. The immediate threatto NATO&apos;s forces in the Central Region isposed by the Warsaw Pact forces in Czechoslovakia, East German;and Poland.    These comprise 26 Soviet and 31 other Warsaw Pactdivisions.    During a period of tension these could be reinforcedfrom the 30 further divisions in the Soviet Western MilitaryDistricts.   All the Soviet divisions stationed in other Warsaw Pactcountries, and certain other Warsaw Pact divisions, are almost fullymanned in peacetime, but      most of those in the Westernmilitary districts would need the addition of reservists to makethem combat-ready. (Figare      3        includes on the Warsaw Pactside only            forces stationed in Czechoslovakia, East Germanyand Poland.)CONFIDENTIAL3-6
CONFIDENTIAL317. Soviet military doctrine stresses offensive action as the key tosuccess. In a war with NATO the Warsaw Pact would plan to launch arapid offensive under cover of surprise and deception, backed bymassive fire-power.    The tank armies would play a key role,using their mobility and fare-power to exploit weaknesses exposed bythe initial attack.    They would try to break quickly through NATO&apos;slines, by-passing defences and helping to destroy centres ofpolitical and economic power in the rear areas.   Attacks wouldthen be developed from the side and rear.318. Warsaw Pact ground forces can fight in any type of nuclear ornon-nuclear battle and are steadily improving their abilityto operate in bad weather and at night.    Their structure, trainingand organisation are increasingly geared to the demands of anextended conventional battle without detriment to their nuclearoffensive capability.    The importance Warsaw Pact members attach tothe Central Region is also reflected in the distribution of theirair forces and the numerical superiority they have establishedthere.THE BRITISH ARMY OF THE RHINE (BAOR)319. 1st British Corps, the combat element of BAOR, forms part ofNATO&apos;s Northern Army Group and is responsible for the defence ofa 65-kilometre sector of the Inner German Border.    The Corps issupported by a range of logistic units.   It is neither practicablenor cost-effective to maintain in peacetime in BAOR all the forcesaeeded to counter a fully prepared Warsaw Pact attack; the Corps would haveto be reinforced in time of tension by regular and reserve unitsand individual reservists from the United Kingdom.320. The 1(BR) Corps sector is only part of the Central Regionfront, but its terrain and direct routes to the Ruhr makeit one of the most likely areas into which the Warsaw PactCONFIDENTIAL3-7
CONFIDENTIALwould advance in the event of a major attack.   Such an attackwould he led by a large concentration of tanks   supported bymechanised infantry, artillery, assault helicopters, helicoptergunships and close support aircraft, all concentrated on anarrow front.   It would be the task of 1(BR) Corps to break upthe momentum of such an advance and then to defeat it.    To dothis, reconnaissance forces would have to identify quickly thedirection of the main threat.    These reconnaissance forces wouldinitially be deployed close to the Inner German Border togetherwith what are called aggressive delay forces to disrupt and slowdown the enemy&apos;s advance and to determine the direction and scaleof his attack.    The aggressive delay forces would be withdrawnthrough the main defensive position after they had disrupted theenemy&apos;s advance.   The forces in the main defensive position wouldthen absorb any attack   and create time and opportunities forother formations to counter-attack in order to regain lost ground. 1321. 1(BR) Corps is composed of four armoured divisions and oneartillery division.    Each armoured division is made up of a number 1brigades; but on the battlefield the basic unit is the battle group.)Based upon either an armoured regiment or a mechanised infantrybattalion, and commanded by a Lieutenant-Colonel, a battle groupcontains a mix of armoured squadrons and mechanised companies, but Iis also supported by artillery and engineers and has its ownanti-tank guided weapons troop, a close reconnaissance troop and an|air defence section.    This organisation is flexible and can bealtered to meet whatever tasks it may be called upon to perform onthe battlefield.   A typical battle group fighting a defensive bat tiland based upon an organisation of one armoured squadron and twomechanised companies could contain about 600 men, 15 tanks and80 armoured personnel carriers.CONFIDENTIALV 5
CONFIDENTIAL322. To perform its role l(BR) Corps must have enough men, soundlydeployed and equipped.    BAOR&apos;s peacetime establishment of some55,000 would in war be more than doubled.   Regular and TerritorialArmy (TA) units would be sent from the United Kingdom and other unitwould return as necessary from further afield.    Individual reser-vists would increase units to their wartime strength and replacebattle casualties.   All these reinforcements must reach the battlerapidly, and detailed plans for this are kept under constant review.The new Individual Reinforcement Plan becomes fully operationalduring 1981 and will halve the time needed to mobilise thereservists.CRUSADER 80323. Exercise CRUSADER 80, held in September 1980, demonstrated thespeed and efficiency with which TA units can be deployed from theUnited Kingdom to their battle positions. ThT&apos;Army&apos;s ability toreinforce was tested on the largest scale attempted since thelast war, in three separate   but inter-related exercises.SQUARE LEG- tested selected plans and procedures for the call-outof the TA and for defence of the United Kingdom.   JOG TROTpractised the establishment of lines of communication throughBelgium, the Netherlands and the Federal Republic of Germany andtheir use in the movement of 30,000 men, with equipment, from theUnited Kingdom.    SPEARPOINT, the culmination of CRUSADER 80, wasa field training exercise designed to test operational techniqueswith American and Federal German troops on a bigger scale thanever before.EQUIPMENT324. The Corps has a wide range of equipment, with the mainemphasis on anti-armour and air defence weapons.CONFIDENTIAL2 )
CONFIDENTIALChieftain tanks (of which the Corps has about 600),       Milan andSwingfire anti-tank guided weapons, anti-tank helicopters and mineswould all contribute to defeating        enemy armour.    Integral airdefence is provided by the Rapier and Blowpipe missile systems, ilarge proportion of the in-place Corps infantry is mechanised, mov-ing   on the battlefield by armoured personnel carrier. Artillarysupport is provided by a range of self-propelled and towed guns,and the engineers who support the battle groups are equipped toconstruct or remove obstacles and to bridge major rivers. TheCorps is planned to be strengthened in the mid-1980s with Challengertanks and more self-propelled guns.    (Chapter 6 gives moredetails of the equipment programme.)RAF GERMANY325. Air power has always played a very important part in NATOstrategy.   In the early stages of an attack, particularly if itwere mounted with little warning, allied air forces would have akey role in disrupting Warsaw Pact tactics and deployments andimposing maximum delay and casualties, thereby winning time forNATO units   to be reinforced and take up their battle positions.The 12 aircraft squadrons of Royal Air Force Germany (RAF(G))must therefore be kept at a high state of readiness.   There aialso four Rapier short-range air defence missile squadrons, aBloodhound missile squadron for area air defence and a fieldsquadron of the RAF Regiment for airfield security.    All theseforces form part of NATO&apos;s Second Allied Tactical Air Force.326. To carry out their role the RAF(G) squadrons would undertake tlfollowing   interrelated tasks:- StrikeSelective air attack with nuclear weapons against specifictargets might be necessary to demonstrate political will andto induce an opponent to stop aggression.    Buccaneers andJaguars would be tasked in this role.CONFIDENTIAL3-/0
CONFIDENTIAL- InterdictionThis would fall to the Buccarrerers and Jaguars and would involveattacks against units behind the line of battle, and thedisruption of second-echelon formations, road and railcommunications and the movement of enemy reserve forces.- Counter air operationsOperations against such targets as airfields and commandcentres are particularly effective in limiting an enemy&apos;sfreedom of action and flexibility.    Buccaneers and Jaguarswould be used in this role.- Air defence of both the l(BR) Corps area and RAF base areasThis is provided by two squadrons of Phantoms and - atshorter range - by the Bloodhound and Rapier squadrons.- Close air support in direct support of land forcesThe bulk of this task is assigned to the Harriers, which canoperate flexibly and securely from dispersed sites.They would attack tanks and armoured vehicles on thebattlefield and could be assisted by Jaguars and Buccaneersif necessary.- Tactical reconnaissanceGround and air force commanders will need prompt and accurateinformation on enemy dispositions and reinforcements ;a        squadron of Jaguars would help in collecting this.- Helicopter support for 1(BR) CorpsA squadron of Puma helicopters would help   move men, storesand ammunition.    This squadron is being supplemented bya squadron of Chinook helicopters, due to enter servicein 1982.327. The effectiveness of modern air defence radars and weaponsmeans that all our combat aircraft, if they are to survive, mustbe able to fly at very low level by day or night in all weathers,CONFIDENTIAL1, II
CONFIDENTIALand possibly in the face of heavy electronic jamming.    Peaceti atraining must therefore ensure great proficiency in thesetechniques.    (See page C       J on  on&quot;fcr l of low-flyingdisturbance.)    The standards achieved by the RAF are alreadyhigh, as is shown   by the consistently good results achieved inNATO operational evaluation exercises.328. Over the next few years the Tornado GR1 will replace theJaguars and Buccaneers for interdiction, counter-air   and recotmais.sance operations.With its advanced navigation and attack systems,- wide range of weapons and advanced counter-measures to help combathe increasingly sophisticated Warsaw Pact ground and fighterdefences, the Tornado is particularly well suited for these roles.The Eastern Atlantic and Channel329. The conventional defence of Central Europe depends cruciallyon transatlantic reinforcement and resupply.    Despite the majorimprovements now planned in airlift and pre-stocking, the bulkof equipment and   resupply would have to come by sea.    In addition,the economic survival of the European members of NATO, and the UnitKingdom in particular, depends on trade and raw materials fromoverseas;96$ of the United Kingdom&apos;s external trade movesby sea.   The Warsaw Pact is not dependent on the sea in either ofthese ways, and it is impossible to interpret the massiveimprovement of the Soviet Navy as other than offensive in strategicconcept.330. NATO must therefore have strong maritime forces, and theUnited Kingdom makes a major contribution to these.    We are situateat the focus of the busiest sea-lanes in the world and also closeto the main route for Soviet warships deploying to the Atlantic,are thus geographically well placed to play a major part in NATOmaritime strategy.CONFIDENTIAL3-12
CONFIDENTIAL331. Action at sea in support of the defence of Europe couldtake many possible forms, in various places.   Our maritime taskswould include:- Independent Strategic Nuclear DeterrentThis has been discussed in Chapter 2.- Containment of Soviet Naval ForcesNATO European Forces, largely made up of Royal Navy andRoyal Air Force elements, would seek to contain Sovietforces and hinder their deployment through such &quot;choke points&quot;as the Greenland-Iceland-UK Gap.   They would also have tobear the brunt of any Soviet aggression in the Eastern Atlanticand Channel until the arrival of United States forces. Submarines wouldprovide the best forward defence, as they could operateeffectively in hostile waters.    RN Task Groups and shore-based maritime aircraft provide a wide range of defensiveand offensive capabilities,as depicted in Figure 8.- Defence of Reinforcement and Resupply ShippingReinforcement should begin during a period of tension, butmight be opposed at any time.    Resupply to sustain a con-ventional defence of Europe would be a massive task and lastthroughout any period of fighting. Direct defence ofreinforcement and resupply shipping, made easier by thecontainment mentioned above, would be essential to counter anyopposing forces that were in position before hostilities beganor had penetrated NATO&apos;s forward defences.- Provision of Anti-Submarine Support for the NATO StrikeFleetThe United Kingdom makes a major contribution to theanti-submarine defence of the NATO Strike Fleet Atlantic,allowing the United States strike carriers to concentrateon their air defence and strike/attack roles, which are ofCONFIDENTIAL1   \i
CONFIDENTIALkey importance on NATO&apos;s Northern flank.    British forceswould make up Anti-Submarine Group 2 comprising one or twoanti-submarine carriers with Sea Harriers and anti-submarinewarfare (ASW) helicopters,  several air defence destroyers ananti-submarine frigates, Nimrod long-range maritime patrolaircraft and perhaps also nuclear-powered attack submarines,- Deployment of UK/Netherlands Amphibious Force (See paragraphWe provide Royal Marines Commando forces to reinforce theNorthern flank of NATO in Norway and Denmark, and also i heAtlantic islands.    The combined UK/Netherlands AmphibiousForce could arrive well before United States and Canadianreinforcements.    In tension and in the early stages ofconflict. its movement would need protection from Sovietair, surface and submarine attack.- Protection of UK and NATO Merchant ShippingNATO recognises the need for protection of shipping inpeace        and      war both within and outside the NATO area.Our naval and air forces are capable of deployment andsupport world wide, as discussed in Chapter 4,In tension or in war most of our surface vessels and all oursubmarines and maritime aircraft would be committed to the Alliance332. Our maritime forces are primarily designed    for anti-subs&apos;iarinwarfare, as the most dangerous threat is from Soviet submarines.However, at sea as on land, Soviet doctrine is one of massiveco-ordinated attack.    Their submarines, armed with long-rangeanti-ship missiles as well as torpedoes,combine    with surface an&apos;naval air forces  to pose a wide-ranging and varied threat.333. Shore-based air support is vital to the success of manymaritime operations.    The Royal Air Force&apos;s four squadrons ofCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALNimrod long-range maritime patrol aircraft contribute mainlyto the ASW battle but can also undertake surveillance ofsurface ships.    The Nimrods are currently undergoing anextensive avionic modernisation.The first of the modernised aircraft -designated Nimrod MR2 - have already entered service. Shore-based air defence cover for the Royal Navy is provided by twosquadrons of RAF Phantom aircraft.    These could be joined bymore UK-based aircraft if priorities so dictated.    There aretwo squadrons of Buccaneers armed with Martel missiles andlaser-guided bombs for attacking enemy surface ships.Defence of the United Kingdom Base334. The direct defence of the United Kingdom has three aspects:air defence; maritime defence; and Army tasks.   We explained inlast year&apos;s Statement (paragraph 335) the importance, of the UnitedKingdom base to the defence of NATO.AIR DEFENCE335. The Soviet Union has available for attack on Western Europesome 500-600 heavy and medium bombers.   These could carryfree-fall bombs or stand-off weapons armed with eitherconventional or nuclear warheads.    The first task of our airdefences is to detect the approach of enemy aircraft. Shackletonairborne early warning (AEW) aircraft and a chain of ground radarinstallations, together with NATO&apos;s continental radar network, arethe &apos;eyes&apos; of our air defence system.    They gather informationon the presence and position of hostile aircraft   and transmit itto the operations centres which control the air defence effort.In the next few years these detection facilities will be con-siderably improved and extended.    The AEW version of the Nimrodwill replace and considerably improve upon the Shackleton, and theCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALUnited Kingdom Air Defence Ground Environment (UKADGE) will includenew, mobile, three-dimensional radars and an automated commandand control system.336. Our first line of air defence would be our fighter screen:five squadrons of Phantoms and two Squadrons of Lightnings are keptat a high state of readiness to intercept attacking aircraft. Twosquadrons of Victor K2 tankers provide air-to-air refuelling tokeep our fighters airborne longer.    The fighters also have apeacetime role, being ready at short notice to intercept Sovietmilitary aircraft on intelligence-gathering or other missions, Onaverage during 1980 five such aircraft a week were intercepted andidentified in the airspace around Britain.   Behind the fighterscreen, Bloodhound and Rapier surface-to-air missile systems providia further line of defence.   Rapier gives cover at short range againlow-level air attack while Bloodhound gives medium-range protection,(See also Figure 9.)   We need a new medium-range missile for thefuture and hope to build one in collaboration with our Europeanallies.337. Several improvements to these defences are already in hand,notably in air-to-air missiles and in the modification of Hawktrainer aircraft to carry missiles.    In the early 1980s we plan tointroduce a squadron of VC10 aircraft now being converted forair-to-air refuelling, and in the mid-1980s the air defence versionof the Tornado - the F2 - will enter service.RAPIER FOR THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE (USAF)338. In February this year the British and United States&apos; Governmensigned a Memorandum of Understanding covering the USAF&apos;s purchase of32 Rapier fire units to defend their bases in this country. Formalcontracts for these will be let shortly but work has already begun.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALUnder the agreed arrangements the United Kingdom will provide andtrain RAF officers and men for a wing headquarters and three Rapiersquadrons.    The cost of the RAF manpower will be recovered inaccordance with the published exchange of letters dated 14 and 15July 1980 between the US Secretary for Defense and the United KingdomSecretary of State for Defence.    This is an outstanding exampleof defence cooperation between our two countries.MARITIME DEFENCE339. The main threat to shipping in British waters would besubmarines armed with torpedoes, missiles and mines; and in inshorewaters,the mine alone.    This threat, if not countered, couldaffect the deployment of ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs),essential shipping routes, reception ports and naval bases.The Soviet Union possesses a vast stock of advanced modernsea mines, which could be laid by aircraft and surface ships, aswell as submarines, over the entire Continental Shelf at a rateof hundreds of mines per day.340. The submarine threat in United Kingdom waters is an extensionof that in EASTLANT.    Our ASW effort inthe predominantly shallow waters around the British Isles isdesigned to prevent submarine mining and submarine torpedo andmissile attacks on our military and commercialshipping.   For this task we have surface ships, helicopters andmaritime patrol aircraft.   We are also modernising our own minesand plan to develop new types for defensive and protective mining.Surface warships with an air defence capability will also beintegrated into the United Kingdom air defence network whilecarrying out other duties such as ASW.341. To meet the mining threat we are introducing the new HuntClass vessels capable of both   minehunting and minesweeping. TheirCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALglass-reinforced plastic construction gives them a high degre 0fprotection against mines.   They use minehunting sonar to locatemines and then use a wire-guided vehicle aimed by television todeal with them.    Future offshore patrol vessels could be equippedin wartime for both minelaying and minesweeping.    The protection ofour offshore resources (oil, gas and fish) is discussed in ChapterUNITED KINGDOM LAND FORCES (UKLF)342. The role played by UKLF inreinforcing continental Europe has already been mentioned. Itinvolves training reinforcement units in peace, and in tension orwar it would mean mobilising Regular and Territorial Army (TA) unitstogether with individual reservists, stores and equipment, toreinforce BAOR and meet our other NATO commitments.343. A similarly vital role is played by UKLF in the defence of theUnited Kingdom base.    Some 30$ of the Army&apos;s mobilized strengthwould be available for home defence.    This includes Regular and TAunits   and units formed on mobilization from the training and baseorganizations,or recalled reservists.    These forces would guardvital military and civilian installations against disruptionor sabotage; would seek to destroy any force landed by an enemy; andwould assist the civil police as required.    In some cases the staticnature of guard duties does not require the full range of militarytraining or experience: we are therefore considering whether theseforces should be supplemented by additional reservists, possiblyoperating on a local basis,  so that fully trained personnel could bereleased for more demanding tasks.344. One of the keys to successful use and defence of the UnitedKingdom base would be an efficient and reliable military communicatisystem: a new VHF radio system, which would be used for the commandof home defence forces in war, is to be introduced this year.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALSpecialist Reinforcement Forces345. From the northern to the southern flank of NATO territory isa distance of over two thousand miles, much of it in sharedfrontiers with Warsaw Pact countries.   NATO cannot hope to havein-place forces along this entire perimeter.   But in spite oftheir relative remoteness and difficult terrain, the northernand southern flanks are vulnerable to challenges which NATO mustbe able to counter.346. The need for specialist reinforcement forces goes furtherthan this. .  Their flexibility and ability to respond tocrises in various parts of Alliance territory makes it harder fora potential aggressor to assess what forces he may face in agiven area.   Their high state of readiness and ability to deployrapidly to an area of heightened tension lends itself also toanother type of deterrent use, as a prompt signal of collectiveAlliance resolve in the face of threatened aggression (see page /In political terms, meanwhile, these forces provide animportant practical demonstration of the readiness of other NATOnations to come to the aid of an individual member.347. The diverse and highly flexible forces which make up ourcontribution were described in last year&apos;s Statement (paragraphs352-4).     Since then, in order to save overheads, a decision hasbeen taken to merge 41 Commando Royal Marines with the threeremaining Commandos._________________348. Forces for SAGEURa.      Allied Command Europe Mobile Force (AMF).    The AMF is amulti-national force of balanced land and air elements. ItCONFIDENTIAL3
CONFIDENTIALhas several deployment options ranging from Norway and D^nmarJto Italy, Greece and Turkey.    It would usually deploy byair and be resupplied by air and sea.    Given its modest iZedeployment would be primarily designed to demonstrate NATO&apos;ssolidarity and determination.    The force would normally beused for deterrent patrolling as far forward as possible;if aggression came the AMF would remain available to thelocal NATO commander to fight alongside other NATO forces.The British Army contributes some 1800 men, consisting or. aninfantry battalion group, a logistic support battalion andother combat and support troops.    A major part of the combatelement is trained and equipped for Arctic warfare. TheRoyal Air Force contributes a squadron of Harriers and Pumahelicopters to support the land forces.    The force iscurrently commanded by a British Major-General.The United Kingdom Mobile Force (UKMF).    The UKMF is a self-supporting land and air force equipped to counter armour andmechanised infantry.    It can also defend itself against hostiJaircraft and is equipped and trained for operations in eacharea of Allied Command Europe (ACE).

Next year some Pumas will be replaced byChinooks, which will greatly improve the lift capability ofthe force.    The addition of an armoured regiment and a mediumartillery regiment within the next two to three years is beiniconsidered.SACEUR&apos;s Strategic Reserve (Air)(SSR(A)).    The SSR(A) is aforce of British and United States squadrons based in theCONFIDENTIAL3-Q.o
CONFIDENTIALUnited Kingdom.    At present we contribute three Jaguarsquadrons and one Harrier squadron.    One of the Jaguarsquadrons and the Harrier squadron also have alternativedeployment options with the UKMF and AMF respectively. Thisreserve of aircraft is available for SACEUR to redeploy atshort notice to airfields forward in Europe to strengthendefence and to use, for example, against concentrationsof armour and airfields.   The Harrier provides additionalflexibility with its ability to operate from landing sitesremote from conventional airfields.349. Forces for SACLANTThe United Kingdom/Netherlands (UK/NL) Amphibious Force. Anamphibious force is highly flexible and can be largely self-supporting.    It can be sailed towards - and held near - an area oflikely operations without anticipating a political decision tointervene, or formal NATO alert measures.   The UK/NL Landing Forcecan be put ashore without relying on reception ports and airfields.It disembarks rapidly using amphibious craft and helicopters,and is instantly ready for operations.    The force would beequally effective if deployed for operations in North Norway,in the Baltic Approaches or on certain Atlantic islands in theNATO area.    To halt any Soviet attack or outflanking attemptas early as possible it can use landing craft, helicopters andoversnow vehicles to redeploy troops and artillery within itsarea of operations, and subsequently resupply and support them.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALEARNING TIME AND POLITICAL DECISION MAKING1. We have no reason to believe that the present Sovietleaders are deliberately planning to attack NATO. However,should they or their successors wish to do so they havedeveloped and continue to improve the military means to pre-pare rapidly for war and to launch an attack at a time andplace of their own choosing.     Surprise is a great advantagein war, but we believe nevertheless that Soviet leaders wouldnot feel that they could be sure of winning without havingmade some preparations for sustaining an attack and for anyresulting nuclear exchange.     To do this effectively acrossthe length and breadth of the USSR and other Warsaw Pactcountries would be an enormous undertaking.     NATO wouldtherefore expect to receive some warning of Soviet prepara-tions for war, though the amount of warning time would varydepending on the balance the Soviet leaders chose betweensurprise and preparedness.2. The NATO concept of forward defence requires the station-ing of forces well forward in Europe to demonstrate NATO&apos;sdetermination to defend every part of its territory.      It Lsneither politically nor economically practicable to increasethese forces in peacetime to a level where they could countera full-scale conventional attack without substantial rein-forcement,  especially on the flanks.      NATO therefore continue.&apos;)to look for ways of improving its reinforcement planning - forexample    in the Long Term Defence Programme.      Although we canquickly reinforce British Forces Germany fom the UnitedCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALKingdom, as Exercise CRUSADER demonstrated last year, earlypolitical decisions would be needed to call out the TerritorialArmy and the reserves of all Services and to make ships andaircraft available.   Furthermore, the vast majority of thereinforcements for Europe have to cross the Atlantic fromNorth America.   NATO strategy needs this movement to begin earlyin a period of tension.    The decision to reinforce would dependnot just on any notional warning time but on the judgement,political will and resolution of the Alliance.3.     It is important to recognise that prompt NATO decisions -should they ever become necessary - to reinforce Central Europe anthe flanks, to deploy specialist reinforcement forces and toincrease all-round military preparedness might well avert war;they need in no way be an irreversible step towards it. Thedetermination and readiness of the Alliance to plan and, ifnecessary, implement the planning, have in themselves a powerfuldeterrent effect.    If the decision were ever made to reinforceNATO Europe in a period of tension there would simultaneouslybe intense political activity to contain the crisis. Thepolitical and military policies of the Alliance at such a timewould be carefully integrated, with the central aim of preventinga conflict from breaking out.CONFIDENTIAL3- 2Z
CONFIDENTIALCONTROL OF DISTURBANCE IN THE UK LOW-FLYING SYSTEM1. A great deal of low flying is necessary over the UnitedKingdom if aircrew are to maintain the essential standards ofproficiency and readiness.     This inevitably affects manypeople, but extensive measures are taken to limit the nuisanceto the public.2. The training is dispersed as widely and evenly as possiblethroughout the country.     Permission to use the military low-flying system is normally granted only to aircrew based in theUnited Kingdom or RAF Germany and to visiting units from NATOmembers who give us training facilities in their countries.Minimum heights and speeds are prescribed for each low-levelsortie to ensure that the aircraft fly no lower or faster thanabsolutely necessary.     Most of the training is carried outbetween 250 feet and 500 feet above the ground, and the usualcruising speed is 450 knots.     The use of re-heat to boostengine thrust beyond the normal maximum is severelyrestricted.3. Although it is not practicable for pilots to steer clearof every village, their orders require them to avoid flyingdirectly over the conurbations, the larger towns and manysmaller places.     Routine low level training is not normallycarried out between 11pm and 7am, and exceptions must bejSpecially authorised.4. When a special exercise is likely to involve any unusuallow-flying activity the Ministry of Defence informs Members ofParliament, the Press and organisations such as the NationalFarmers* Union.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4.  WIDER DEFENCE INTERESTS401. In Chapter 1 we demonstrated the need for the West to beware of threats to its own and its friends&apos; security in theworld beyond NATO.   Such awareness comes naturally to the UnitedKingdom.    Our political and economic interests have traditionallystretched world-wide, and been supported by several kinds ofdefence activity.    Last year&apos;s Statement on the Defence Estimatesdrew attention to the elements of this activity which continue.Their significance - particularly in those areas where the growingSoviet threat is felt most keenly - has been sharply highlightedby the events of the last eighteen months, and there has been muchdiscussion in this country and in NATO of whether we could andshould do more.    That question must be considered, like the issuesof out-of-area defence as a whole, with due respect for realities.Reinstatement of the former British presence &quot;East of Suez&quot;, whateverthe arguments for and against, is no longer either a political or aneconomic possibility.    What we can do is review each aspectof our worldwide defence activity to ensure that our availableresources are being used as effectively as possible,  both inthe national interest and as part of a coherent overallresponse by the West.402. Chapter 1 defined the three levels at which defenceresources can be brought to bear in this task: assistance,deployments, and intervention.    The United Kingdom has a role -possibly more varied and extensive than that of any European ally -to play at all three levels.Defence Assistance403. This assistance may take the form of training,  both inBritain, and abroad (through the provision of loan servicepersonnel); of advisory visits; and of sale3 or other technical aid.4.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALAssistance is generally tendered to individual countries on term-agreed between the two Governments, but we can also help inthe development of multilateral security cooperation betweenlocal states.404. The professionalism and technical skills of our armedforces are widely respected.   Where possible, the Governmentmakes training places available for foreign military personnelin MOD establishments: during 1979/80 some 4,000 students fromnon-NATO countries trained in the United Kingdom, in addition tosome 1,500 students from NATO countries.    Such training isvaluable in itself, but also helps tc maintain links between theUnited Kingdom and the countries involved.    There are Britishmilitary training teams in several countries.    The number of Servicepersonnel on loan to foreign governments this year totals almost600 deployed in 24 countries, and some 150 Army, Royal Marine andRAF personnel are currently serving in the British Military Advisoryand Training Team in Zimbabwe.    This team was established at the timeof independence, at the Zimbabwe Government&apos;s request.    It iscommanded by a Major-General and is making a key contributionto the task of amalgamating and training the local armed forces.The work of the team in Zimbabwe has been supplemented by theprovision of training courses and attachments to the armed forcesin the United Kingdom.405. The British armed forces have a history of close contactwith the forces of a number of countries, both within andoutside the Commonwealth, which leaves us well placed to helpin their training and development.    MOD&apos;S training establishments4.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALcannot accommodate all requests for places; &quot;but the Governmentbelieves we should continue to give as much military assistanceof this sort as resources allow.   Decisions on the allocation oftraining places and the deployment of loan service personnel (LSP)must take account of several considerations, including the UnitedKingdom&apos;s strategic interests, the nature of our defence relation-ship with the country concerned, and whether their armed forcesoperate similarly to our own, and use British equipment. Britishadvice on training, logistics, defence organisation and equipmentrequirements is often sought, and the Services make and receivemany visits at all levels.   Provision of British defence equipmentcan, as shown in Chapter 6, help to build up the self-defencecapability of states which may have little or no manufacturingcapacity of their own.    The friendly contacts thus established forman important element in our relations with many countries outsideNATO.Deployments406. The map at Fig 11 shows the worldwide deployment of-the ArmedForces in early 1981.   Full details of our standing deploymentswere given in paragraphs 412-422 of the 1980 Statement. Paragraphs407-10 below mention only the more significant developments orchanges during the past year.CYPRUS407. A review of the United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) wascarried out by the United Nations (UN) authorities in 1980. Itsfindings included proposals on the various force elements contributedby the United Kingdom.   As a result, a modest reduction of manpowerhas taken place in the British contingent and a more economical useof helicopters is planned.    These changes do not affect UNFICYP&apos;seffectiveness in its essential peacekeeping role.    The arrangements4.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALwhereby Britain contributes to logistic support for UNFICYP andthe United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) still stand.Britain will continue,  subject to other commitments, to supportcurrent and future UN peacekeeping operations.HONG KONG408. The British forces in Hong Kong demonstrate our commitmentto the integrity and security of the territory.    The main elementsof the garrison are currently four infantry battalions (three ofwhich are Gurkha), Gurkha engineers, five RN patrol craft, asquadron of RAF Wessex helicopters and a squadron of Army Scouthelicopters.    The Hong Kong Government meets 75$ of the costsof the garrison under the Defence Costs Agreement, which wasre-negotiated in October 1980.    The new Agreement will run fromApril this year, will provide for an additional infantry battalionand support elements, and will ensure that the cost-sharing betweenthe two Governments realistically reflects the actual costs of theenlarged garrison.   Build-up of the garrison is now proceeding.The additional infantry battalion will initially be a Gurkhabattalion, which will entail an increase in the size of the Brigadeof Gurkhas.409. Temporary reinforcements have been provided during the pastyear to help check the inflow of illegal immigrants from China.The main elements have been the fast patrol boat HMS Scimitar,two hovercraft, a Royal Marines Raiding Squadron equipped with smallboats, the 1st Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Wales, the 1stBattalion The Parachute Regiment,  elements of the Gurkha battalionfrom Brunei and three Army Air Corps Scout   helicopters with theircrews from the United Kingdom.    The two hovercraft, the RaidingSquadron and the Scout   helicopters are staying in Hong Kong to helpthe local forces.4.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALBELIZE410. British, forces continue to be stationed in Belize. TheGovernment is working towards the achievement of a secure andpeaceful independence for Belize, in accordance with the Resolutionoverwhelmingly adopted last November by the LTN General Assembly.The United Kingdom will be prepared to help Belize in meeting hersecurity requirements after independence and we are consideringthe form that such assistance might take.Exercises and Training411. Exercises, training and manoeuvres account for the bulk ofour temporary deployments in peacetime.   In addition to theirtraining value, they demonstrate Britain&apos;s continued interest,support and capability in the regions concerned.   They offervaluable opportunities for cooperation with host nations andother friendly powers.    Joint exercises and training activitiestake place not only with our NATO allies but also with Commonwealthpartners and third world countries.   Exercises can bring benefitto the host country in other ways: for instance, many Royal Engineerstraining projects carry out valuable construction work and contributeto local development programmes.   There has been renewed interestover the last year in holding joint exercises under the Five PowerDefence Arrangements (providing for consultation on defence matters)to which the United Kingdom is party with Australia, New Zealand,Malaysia and Singapore.    We shall be participating in these exercisesas resources allow.   Annex D to this Statement shows the mostsignificant exercises held outside the NATO area last year.Royal Navy Task Group Deployment412. This year&apos;s major Royal Navy task group (TG 318.0), comprisingtwo destroyers, three frigates and three Royal Fleet Auxiliaries,set sail in May 1980 for a seven-month deployment to the Far East.4.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALA nuclear submarine joined them in the Mediterranean phase.Following an invitation from the People&apos;s Republic of China,three ships - Antrim, Coventry and Alacrity - paid a four-day visitto Shanghai in September 1980, the first ever RN visit to thePeople&apos;s Republic.   Some three months in all were spent in theFar East.    Figure 10 traces the passage of this deployment,showing the ports visited and the main exercises undertaken.413. Because of this group deployment the United Kingdom wasable to respond promptly to the need for a naval presence inthe Gulf of Oman when the outbreak of fighting between Iraq andIran raised the possibility of a threat to &quot;the free passage ofmerchant shipping in the area.   Ships were initially detachedfrom TG 318.0 to provide a patrol of two ships in the ArabianSea.   These were in turn relieved by ships deployed from theUnited Kingdom.    The Government expects to maintain a naval presenceof this kind in the area at least so long as the potential require-ment for protection of merchant shipping persists.Intervention Capability414. The Gulf of Oman patrol is one example of 1he advantagesBritain derives from the ability of HM Forces to operate flexiblyoutside as well as inside the NATO area.    Contingencies where wemight want to take advantage of this include the reinforcement ofdependent territories, as in the case of the New Hebrides mentionedbelow; protection of British citizens, for instance through Serviceaid in evacuation from danger areas; protection of shipping; andvarious forms of support to independent Governments.    Our capabilityalso enables us to carry out tasks of peacekeeping and disaster relieflike those mentioned elsewhere in this Chapter.415. The military power which Britain alone could bring to bearin any of these contingencies is limited.    Resource constraints4.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALand our primary commitment to NATO rule out any idea of creatinga substantial standing &quot;intervention force&quot;.    In any seriousoverseas emergency we would in any case expect to concert ouractions with other Allies.    The value of such cooperation amongWestern powers has been increasingly recognised in NATO this year;as we noted in Chapter 1, the impressive effort by the UnitedStates to enhance its own long-range capability will open up anumber of new possibilities.416. Options for enhancing British capabilities at modest cost,mentioned in paragraph 409 of last year&apos;s Statement, are beingexamined against this background.   Our programme to &quot;stretch&quot; 30 ofthe RAF&apos;s existing Hercules aircraft will be completed over the nextfew years and will increase capacity over short ranges by theequivalent of about eight new aircraft.    We are consideringestablishing a special equipment stockpile for limited operationsoverseas, and restoring a limited parachute assault capability byproviding RAF aircrews with station-keeping equipment and trainingto drop an entire battalion group if necessary within 15 minutes.Improvements are being made in command and control arrangements foroverseas operations; an existing two-star headquarters will benominated and staff earmarked to take command of any contingencyintervention.    This headquarters will be in close contact with allformations that might be called on for such operations.Operations in 1980/81417. In 1980 HM Forces carried out an important overseas operationaldeployment in Vanuatu, previously the New Hebrides.    They havealso undertaken major disaster relief tasks over the last year.NEW HEBRIDES/VANUATU418. A tactical commando headquarters and one rifle company of42 Commando Royal Marines, with Army and RAF support elements,4 .7CONFIDENTIAL

At the requestof the government of Vanuatu, British and French troops stayed in theterritory for a short period after the achievement of independenceon 30 July.RELIEF OPERATIONS419. The Services have helped in various relief activitiesover the past year, including assistance after floods in Belize;building projects in the Falkland Islands; training Gambia PolicePioneers in construction skills; repairing a jetty in South Georgiain the Antarctic; and other tasks in Kenya, Tuvalu and St Vincent.Nepal420. After a severe winter drought in 1979/80 the mountainouswestern areas of Nepal ran seriously short of grain.   Relief workwas hampered by communications problems.    In response to a call forassistance from the Nepalese Government, the Overseas DevelopmentAdministration provided  175,000 to finance an airdrop of foodstuffsto the worst-hit areas.   An RAF Hercules aircraft with two aircrews,an Army Air Despatch Team, a command party, support personnel andequipment deployed to Nepal.   During May-June 1980 this team carriedout 77 missions and dropped 1005 tons of essential food supplies.Hurricane Allen421. In August 1980 HMS Glasgow was diverted to the Caribbean islandof St Lucia, which had been extensively damaged by Hurricane Allen.The ship arrived as the hurricane passed and for four days thecrew cleared roads, repaired buildings and helped restore water,power supplies and communications.    The ship&apos;s helicopter flew4.8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALmedical teams and stores to outlying areas and provided aerialreconnaissance.   Meanwhile, HMS Scylla arrived at the Cayman Islands,which had also suffered hurricane damage, and her crew providedvaluable help on Cayman Brae, the worst-hit of the islands.422. A Royal Engineer troop also visited St Lucia betweenOctober and December 1980 to repair schools, community centresand parts of the electrical transmission system.   Until June 1980the Royal Engineers were still providing similar help on thenearby island of Dominica in repairing damage caused by HurricaneDavid in 1979.4.9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALPART THREERESOURCESBritain&apos;s Armed Forces are a unique national resource,which daily provides protection and assistance in the mostcritical areas of the community&apos;s safety.   The communityin turn provides not only the money, hut also the resources omen, women and industrial capacity from which our forces areconstructed.    The linkage between the community and defencecan hardly be overemphasised: the success of each dependsfundamentally on the whole-hearted efforts and understandingof the other.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5.      ASSISTANCE TO THE COMMUNITY501. The preceding chapters have been concerned with the deterrentand defensive roles of our forces.   Every day of the year, however,the Services are actively engaged within the United Kingdom acrossa broad range of operational activities which call for the specialexpertise that only they can provide, and which can very oftenmake the difference literally between life and death.   The mostsubstantial and, regrettably, most continuous of these is thesupport which the Armed Forces give to the Royal Ulster Constabulary(RUC) in Northern Ireland.    We deal with this first and then goon to discuss the other ways in which Service skills and trainingassist the civil community.   Figures over a span of years on mostof the topics covered in this chapter are given in the tables ofVolume II Section 7.502. This chapter describes the tangible and practical aspectsof Service assistance -bo the community.    In our pursuit ofrealism and economy, however, we must not forget that theBritish also look to the Armed Forces to reinforce that intangiblesense of national pride and self-confidence that is nourished notleast by atmosphere and sentiment.    The Guards; the state pro-cessions; Trooping the Colour; the Royal Marines bands; the RedArrows are all invaluable parts of our national life, withoutwhich no account of Service assistance could be complete. Theircontribution to Service and national morale is considerable.NORTHERN IRELAND503. In some parts of Northern Ireland the Royal Ulster Constabulary(RUC) still needs help from the Armed Forces in the enforcementof law and order.    The restoration of a normal life to NorthernIreland has always been the Government&apos;s aim; and we look forward to5.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALa time when soldiers in the Province can return to their normalduties.   The RUC already operates effectively without Regular Army-help in most areas of the Province, any necessary local assistancebeing provided by the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR).   Despite theefforts of the men of violence, encouraging progress continuesto be made.   The lessening of the overall level of violence during1980 and the RUC&apos;s growing ability to prevent terrorism andarrest those responsible have steadily reduced the need for Army-support.   During 1980 we have been able to withdraw three of themilitary units deployed to the Province on four-and-a-half-monthemergency tours and reduce further the number of troops on supportingtasks.   As a result, the resident garrison of six major units nowoutnumbers those on emergency tours for the first time since 1971,and the total force of ten major units in the infantry role is thelowest Army force level since then.504. Nevertheless, the Government will continue to keep sufficienttroops in the Province to provide whatever support is still neededby the RUC.   The terrorists&apos; campaign of propaganda and violencecontinues and still casts a shadow over some areas.   Their mainweapons - the gun and the bomb - still threaten death anddestruction, though this approach has now been abandoned by allbut the most extreme and politically bankrupt elements. Thestatistics for 1980 in table 7.1 of Volume II of this Statementshow a continuing improvement over previous years.   But statisticscan never adequately portray the many tragedies and the personalsuffering caused by the brutality of mindless violence. Theexamples which follow are just a few of many cases involvingcrimes against members of the Regular Army and the UDR, who risktheir lives every day because of their commitment to protect thepeople of Northern Ireland.5.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL505. Among the most despicable of such crimes was the murder of asoldier who had returned in Londonderry from Germany to visit hiswife in a local hospital after she had lost their baby.   Later inthe year another soldier was shot dead outside the same hospitalwhile waiting to pick up a friend who was visiting his wife andnew-born child.   In a third incident a 59-year-old member of theUDR, due to retire next year, was murdered in his home town whilecollecting for charity.   Like other UDR soldiers, who have beenkilled while on postal rounds or farming their land, he was offduty at the time.506. The callousness of the terrorist contrasts sharply with thecourage and persistence which members of the security forces showevery day in bringing the men of violence to justice.   Figures forarrests are shown in Table 7.1 of Volume II, but they too cannotillustrate fully the sheer dedication and tenacity which theforces of law and order display in their daily work in the Province.One example was on 2 May last year, when four men were arrested inpossession of an M60 machine gun and other weapons.   An Army Officer,killed in the course of the incident, has posthumously been awardeda Military Cross (MC) for his bravery.   Altogether, about 100 awardswere made for service in Northern Ireland, including a DistinguishedService Order, another MC, two Air Force Crosses, one George Medal,one Military Medal and 15 Queen&apos;s Gallantry Medals.OTHER ACTIVITIES507. The Services are seen most typically as a resource of thecommunity in their invaluable work in search and rescue, bombdisposal, protection of offshore installations and fishing grounds5.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALand in emergency assistance after natural disasters. Thesetasks are often dangerous and always performed in difficultconditions.   The high standards of skill and courage with whichthey are carried out rightly attract much public attention.This year we also give new details of the lesser known and lessdramatic defence responsibilities in hydrography and meteorology.THE PRINCES GATE SIEGE508. One event from the past year particularly caught the publicimagination and demonstrated vividly, on live television, theskill, professionalism and courage of the servicemen who took part.This was the ending of the siege which began on 30 April last yearat the Iranian Embassy in Princes Gate, West London.   A group ofsix terrorists had occupied the embassy and demanded the release ofprisoners being held in Iran.   After cordoning off the area thepolice began negotiations with the aim of bringing the incident toa peaceful conclusion.   Five hostages were released as a result,but the situation changed dramatically on the afternoon of5 May, when shots were heard from inside the Embassy, and shortlyafterwards the body of one of the hostages was thrown into thestreet.   The terrorists threatened to murder more hostages iftheir demands were not met, and the Home Secretary authorised anassault on the embassy by the Special Air Services Regiment toprevent more innocent lives being lost.    The assault was successful,and all except one of the hostages were rescued alive.   Five ofthe terrorists were killed and the sixth arrested.MILITARY AID TO THE CIVIL COMMUNITY509. During the year the three Services have again aided thecommunity in a wide range of projects.    Last October troopsfrom the King&apos;s Own Royal Border Regiment and 75 Engineer Regiment5.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALprovided, together with others, water-borne rescue teamswhen the valleys of the Ribble and the Wyre were severelyflooded.   During July a troop from 22 Engineer Regiment built agirder bridge across the River Soudley in Gloucestershire for thelocal village hall committee.   Throughout the year Servicedivers have helped the police in emergency underwater searchoperations.MILITARY AID TO CIVIL MINISTRIES510. Servicemen made a major contribution to running emergencytemporary prisons during the winter when, at the Home Secretary&apos;srequest, Service police and supporting units assisted the prisonauthorities and civil police in dealing with the effects ofindustrial action by the Prison Officers&apos; Association. TheServices were used only in the last resort as a safeguard tothe community and demonstrated once again their flexibility in anunfamiliar and difficult role.BOMB DISPOSAL511. The Services&apos; bomb disposal teams continue to respond tocalls for assistance throughout the United Kingdom.    Their work inNorthern Ireland in dealing with terrorist devices is well known,but on the mainland too they do essential and hazardous work.    In thepast year in Britain alone some 5,987 calls were received and10,693 explosive items were safely disposed of in the course ofclearance operations.512. The primary role of the Services&apos; bomb disposal experts isthe safe detonation of unexploded ordnance, but they are also trainedto deal with a wide range of terrorist devices.    They normally workin small teams, located throughout the country; at the requestof the Home Office they have recently agreed to take over from theMetropolitan Police responsibility for providing support for Home5.5CONFIDENTIAL
CO NFIDENTIALCounties Forces.   Improved arrangements have also been made toinvolve Royal Navy and RAF as well as Army teams in helpingthe police.513. The high success rate of Service teams in safely disposing ofexplosives is a tribute to their skill, dedication and standardof training.   Among the many notable examples from Northern Irelandin the past year was the request in September for bomb disposalteams to help recover the body of Mr Wallace Allen, a reserveRUC constable who had been ambushed and shot dead by the ProvisionalIRA while driving a milk lorry.   His body was removed by theterrorists and the lorry was booby-trapped.   As well as clearingthe lorry, the bomb disposal experts had to deal over thenext 12 days with a number of explosive devices placed in areaswhere the Security Forces were told Mr Allen&apos;s body could be found.In one case a dummy body was used to lure soldiers into an areawhere a remotely controlled explosive device had been laid. Whenthe body was finally dumped by the Provisional IRA the same thoroughprecautions had to be taken by the bomb disposal teams before itcould be removed and returned to his family.PROTECTION OF OFFSHORE RESOURCES514. The Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force work together inprotecting our offshore interests.    The major elements of theirforces are: five Island class offshore patrol vessels (with twomore from other duties as necessary), nine Ton class mine counter-measures vessels, various RN aircraft, a company of Royal Marinesand RAF Nimrods from Kinloss and St Mawgan.   HMS Speedy, the RoyalNavy&apos;s first jetfoil, is currently being evaluated in the offshoreprotection role.    These forces also keep in close -touch with thefishery protection vessels of the Department of Agriculture andFisheries for Scotland, which patrol some of the fishing grounds5.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONPIDEITTIALoff the Scottish coasts.   The Nimrods and the Island class shipscombine fishery protection duties with patrols of offshore oil andgas installations.515. As well as surveillance and deterrence some policing isinvolved.    In 1980 the Royal Navy boarded 1,508 British and foreignfishing vessels and, following prosecutions initiated by thefisheries departments, 16 of these were convicted of contraveningfishing regulations.   Such prosecutions can cover a wide varietyof offences, including fishing in prohibited areas, using netsof an illegal mesh size, or exceeding catch quotas.516. Deterrence of terrorist activity is particularly importantin the case of oil or gas installations.    The ability to reactquickly is crucial and has been recognised in the formation of anew Royal Marines Company (Comacchio Company) at Arbroath in Maylast year.    Throughout the year this company maintains Royal Marinesat very short notice to respond to an offshore incident.517. Since it was formed the company has been involved in threeexercises on offshore platforms.    In July a major exercise was heldin the Ninian field; it also involved Royal Navy ships and heli-copters and RAF Nimrods and photo-reconnaissance aircraft. Sixfurther exercises are planned for this year.518. Some of the improvements to the naval and air forces engagedin offshore protection are described in Chapter 6.SEARCH AND RESCUE519. Helicopters of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force as well asRAF Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft are in constant readiness toundertake search and rescue missions.   Although the primarypurpose of the teams is military, in peacetime the overwhelmingmajority of missions flown are to rescue civilians. Helicoptersquadrons of the two Services flew 1,173 missions and rescued 834people during 1980o5.7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL |520. The seas around Great Britain have always been among 1iiebusiest in the world.    The traditional categories of seafaringBriton - fisherman, merchant sailor and yachtsman - have nowbeen joined by another: the oil rig worker, who may also fromtime to time stand urgently in need of Hie rescue services. Atragic reminder of the risks run by those who work in the NorthSea was the disaster which overtook the oil rig support platforAlexander Keilland, which capsized on 27 March 1980 with 212 peopleon board.   Despite appalling weather conditions, Royal Navy unitsjoined in the rescue work, while RAF Nimrods provided a communicatioBcentre over the disaster area for the British and Norwegian rescueteams.    Service helicopters flew a total 122 hours, rescued tenpeople and located a further 26, who were later rescued by arecovery vessel.HYDROGRAPHY521. The Royal Navy&apos;s, survey flotilla is largely occupied withcarrying out surveys to meet defence requirements.    The growingcapabilities of Soviet and other Warsaw Pact naval forces in, forexample, submarine and anti-submarine warfare, together withdevelopments in our own systems, permit no relaxation in defence-oriented survey work.    The operational effectiveness of our ownsubmarines, including the future Trident submarines, depends ontheir having detailed and accurate knowledge of the environment inwhich they operate.522. The Royal Navy&apos;s survey flotilla consists, at 31 March 1981,of four ocean survey ships, four coastal survey vessels and fourinshore survey craft, one of which, the civilian-manned Waterwitgh,is due to be paid off in April.    In addition a hydrographic surveyteam is embarked in the ice patrol ship HMS Endurance.5.8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL523. All ships are fitted with a wide range of precision navigationequipment and survey sensors, such as surveying echo sounders forwater depth measurement on the Continental Shelf and towedside-scan sonars to locate wrecks and other underwater dangers.524. The three remaining inshore survey craft, all now over20 years old, are to he replaced over the next few years bythree new and more suitable vessels.   These are a 15-metre launchfor surveying approaches to naval ports, an improved coastalsurvey vessel for use in exposed coastal waters, and a surfaceeffect craft (a type of hovercraft) for use in the shallow watersof the southern North Sea and the outer approaches of the ThamesEstuary.525. The Hydrographic Department at Taunton uses the dataprovided by the Survey Flotilla and data from other sources toproduce and maintain a world series of charts and publicationswhich are the mainstay of the international merchant marine.Nearly 1,000 staff are employed in the process from initial com-pilation to fair drawing, printing and distribution worldwide.Eighty per cent of the total output of charts and nauticalpublications is sold, amounting in the calendar year 1980 to2,772,000 charts and 575,000 books.METEOROLOGY526. The Meteorological Office is a part of the Ministry of Defence,but serves all sections of the community.    It also takes aleading part in international cooperation through the WorldMeteorological Organisation and acts in concert with the otherWestern European services.    It collects, distributes and publishesmeteorological observations; provides forecasts,  services andadvice; and undertakes research.    Specialised support is providedfor the Services; civil aviation; shipping; agriculture; theenergy, water,  construction and other public and private industries;5.9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALand local authorities.   The general public are served throughthe news media, Weather Centres in major cities, and theautomatic telephone weather service.   About one third of thecost of the Office is recovered to the defence budget fromnon-defence users.    Table 7.9 of Volume II shows the appor-tionment- of expenditure between civil and defence activities.527. An important recent development has been the provision ofweather information through the Prestel service of the PostOffice.   This gives users access to a wide range of up-to-dateobservations and forecasts, and makes possible the efficientcollection of a reasonable fee from each user.    The expansionof this service should provide substantial benefits to theusers and to the Meteorological Office.   Steady progress is beingmade in methods of making and transmitting observations:automatic weather stations, radars and satellites play anincreasingly important role, and communications facilities arecontinually being improved.   Improvements are also being made inthe computer methods used to forecast the weather. Particularattention is given to forecasting for a few hours ahead in supportof the Royal Air Force, and to the study of possible long-termchanges in climate.   Specialised weather forecasts also play animportant part in offshore oil production.    &apos;Weather window&apos;prediction is a vital element in planning tows of oil rigs andequipment and supply barges.   All these tasks require greatcomputing power, and preparations are well advanced for theinstallation during 1981 of a new, very fast Cyber 205 computerwhich will make possible more realistic simulations of climateand more detailed short-range forecasts.5.10CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALDEFENCE PROCUREMENT STRATEGY1. The procurement &quot;budget is provided by Parliament for theresearch, development and production of equipment for the Armedforces.   It cannot be used specifically to support industry inits civil markets.    The defence industrial base was created tosatisfy the equipment needs of the Services and not vice versa.But there are many strands of interdependence between the Forces,the defence industries and the economy as a whole; and it is animportant aim of defence procurement policy to foster these linksand exploit the full scope they offer for mutual benefit.2. The scale of the interaction between defence and the economyis shown by the figures in paragraph 605. of this Statement. Therelationship is particularly close in high technology industries;!;he Ministry of Defence buys some 20$ of British electronics output,ibout a third of the total output of the shipbuilding industry andabout half that of the aerospace industry. Defence-inspiredtechnological advance also benefits the community through spin-offsuch as integrated circuitry, advanced avionics and radars inaircraft, visual display units in computing, and digital communica-tions systems.3. Procurement starts with the formulation of requirements; onlese the size and shape of the defence industrial base ultimatelyspend.   It is in formulating these requirements and devising; conomical programmes to meet them, for our Services and, desirably,or other countries too, that the Government&apos;s responsibility foranaging the procurement budget in the best national interest comesmost keenly into play.    The choices involved are not simple:-here are many considerations, whose relative weight is not easyto assess.    The time factor is a major added complication. Mostimportant equipment items have long development lead-times and6.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALat least equally long projected lives.   Threats, and thinkingon how to meet them, can change markedly over this timescale arilso can costs, including those of spares, support and manpower.The cheapest option is thus not always that which presents thelowest capital cost in the short term.   But some of the generalchoices facing us in procurement can be clearly identified, andthe more important of them are discussed below.4. There are clearly important reasons why we should normallyaim to buy British.   The arguments for doing so are not limited tothe direct benefits to employment and the saving on imports. Thelong-term commitment of British industry to meeting our defenceneeds swells the national investment in R &amp; D and technologicalprogress, and helps us to guarantee the maximum pay-off from thatinvestment.    It bolsters our defence sales potential and improvesBritish industry&apos;s credentials for winning a worthwhile andchallenging part in international collaborative projects. Besides,self-reliance in defence - bringing with it the freedom to shapeour equipment requirements primarily to our own need - has a valuein its own right.    It may be false economy to opt for a cheaperforeign product if the result is to weaken or lose altogether Britisindustry&apos;s own producing capacity in that line.   We would then bedependent for future generations of equipment on foreign suppliersand on their ideas of what to produce and when, and on how muchto charge.5. This does not mean that we should pay an unlimited premiumfor a Made in Britain label.    The Government has a prime respon-sibility to make a cost-effective use of total defence resources.With current financial constraints and the constant real costincreases of new technologically advanced equipment it becomesessential not just to obtain value for money but to cut costs6.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL/herever possible.    There are many ways to do this, fromreducing the range of equipment we use, seeking a higherperformance from each item so that economies in numbers arepossible and devising more cost effective production, through tothe benefits that can be obtained from better competition andlarger production runs supported either by sales prospects or thevarious forms of collaboration.   At all points the performanceof industry is a crucial factor.    Only by offering competitiveproducts of the right quality and standards, on time and at theright price, can the British defence industry hold its own bothin national procurement plans and among the vanguard of thetechnologically advanced nations of the world.6.     Defence sales are discussed on page /~*      J.   The pros andoons of collaboration were analysed fully in last year&apos;sStatement, paragraphs 737-742.    Collaborative projects can help usshare the financial burden and technical risks associated withdevelopment, as well as bringing economies of scale in productionad a bonus in interoperability.   The Government is determined toplay a leading role in encouraging allied cooperation of this kind.In the last year we have continued our efforts with our main NATOirrtners - who share many of our financial problems - to identifyollaborative prospects for future generations of equipment.   An ]iportant agreement was signed in August 1980 by Britain, France,ie Federal German Republic and the United States on futureJir-to-air missiles (see paragraph 625b).    This was the firstfruit of initiatives taken to improve transatlantic cooperationthrough &apos; package&quot; arrangements.    It provides for the complementaryJvelopment in Europe and America of separate systems for which both&apos;ill   have a requirement.    The result is to spread costs and to help: f - i________________j6.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALmaintain a strong defence industrial base on both sides of theAtlantic.7. Competition is as healthy and desirable in the defenceindustries as anywhere else.    It encourages lower prices andgreater efficiency; it also stimulates innovation and encourageshigh quality.   Several areas of the British defence industry havebeen rationalised to such an extent that an element of competitioncan in practice only be introduced by maintaining the option ofbuying abroad.   Where competition can be retained without unduecost or penalty the Government welcomes it and will proceedaccordingly in both national and collaborative projects.    Where itis not practicable, we shall seek to encourage economical per-formance by contractual incentives.8. The complexity of individual decisions in procurement -affected by all the factors mentioned above, and more - makes itparticularly important that they should be guided by an overallstrategy geared to certain fundamental principles.   One primefactor is the military requirement.   Another is the finite shareof resources available.   A third is value for money.   Within theframework these establish, the Government will use the purchasingpower of the defence budget to give the maximum practicable supportto British industry, which does not rule out judicious overseaspurchase.    The precise content of that support is bound to evolvewith time, as will the defence industrial base itself.   It willbe our abiding aim to secure, through our decisions in the procure-ment field, the maintenance of those vital areas of Britishexpertise which best serve our Forces&apos; needs and which offer thebest future opportunities in terms of new technologies, theirapplications and marketing potential.6.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL &gt; . EQUIPMENT501. The effectiveness of our forces in the roles described ini^art Two depends on their having the right equipment, in the rightquantities and at the right time.    It is the primary aim of thelefence equipment programme to provide this at the right price.The main factors which shape the requirements for individual itemsof equipment are described in paragraphs 608-610 below.o02. The equipment programme impinges, however, on many otherinterests besides those of tie Armed Forces.    The defence industrialbase is big enough to figure significantly in national patterns of mployment, the development and use of technology, and the performanceof the economy as a whole.    The complex issues to which these factsgive rise in defence procurement policy - including the relativelaims of sales prospects, collaborative ventures, and short andlonger-term judgements on value for money and competitiveness -are discussed separately on page(s) J.HE PROGRAMME603. In 1981/82 it is planned to spend  5352 million (at 1981/82stimates prices) on equipment: 44$ of the defence budget (the&lt;omparable figure in the 1980/81 Estimates was 40$). Whenisociated personnel and other costs ( 498 million) are added in,the estimate of total procurement expenditure reaches  5850 million,_or 48$ of the defence budget.604. This expenditure pays for the purchase of spares and therovision of maintenance items for older equipment; for theroduction of equipment developed in the 1970s; for the developmentof new systems for the coming decade; and for research which isalready looking ahead to the twenty-first Century.   A reasonable:alance must be kept between these different elements of the6.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALprogramme.   Figure 12 shows the expected pattern in 1981/82,together with a further analysis of the main areas of productionexpenditure.605. In recent years about 75$ of equipment expenditure has goneto national contracts placed with British industry.    Our share ofcollaborative projects has taken another 15$.   The remaining 10$is spent on contracts placed overseas.   Expenditure on defenceequipment is estimated to support about 220,000 jobs in directemployment in the defence industries and about the same numberindirectly in industry as a whole.    (See Figure 14.)THE MORATORIUM AND AFTER606. A particular feature of the past financial year was themoratorium on the placing of new defence contracts imposed fromthe beginning of August to the beginning of November last year,and the period that followed it of stringent discipline in theplacing of new contracts.   Both measures were made necessary bythe fact that industry, with a shortage of civil orders in a timeof recession, has been getting through its defence work morequickly than usual, and more quickly also than our financialestimates had provided for.    (See also paragraph 808.)607. Experience has shown that, in present economic circumstances,we have too full an equipment programme for the financial resourcesavailable for defence.   We have also had to take account of thedecision reached in November 1980 to reduce the planned increasein the defence budget by  200 million in each of the next threefinancial years as one of the measures to restrain the growth inpublic expenditure.    The programme changes announced earlier thisyear against this background involve the phasing out of some older6.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALequipment, the deferring of some equipment purchases, thetrimming of works and training programmes and further reductionof overheads.   These changes were selected to ensure the leastpossible detriment to our defence industrial and technologicalcapabilities consistent with our defence needs and financialcircumstances.    The same considerations will apply as we adjustche programme for 1982/83 and subsequent years.    The remainderof this chapter explains how the equipment programme currentlystands following the decisions announced for 1981/82.THE EQUIPMENT608. New equipment is developed and produced in response to a newor increasing threat and to replace obsolescent equipment.    We haveto assess now the threats of the 1990s and beyond, the weapons thatare likely to be in hostile hands at that time and the technologiesthese may incorporate.    We have to judge what new requirementsand operational concepts are needed in the roles discussed inPart Two and what technological advances we must secure, throughresearch and development, to ensure effective new weapons.Intelligence about the threat therefore plays a vital role in thelormulation of our equipment programme.i09. No less crucial, however, is the availability of resources.In the years immediately ahead (as illustrated in Figure 22 of lastear&apos;s Statement) the bulk of the money available is earmarked forequipment already approved.    The pressure on resources is furtherincreased by the escalation in the real costs of successive-generations of new equipment.    (See Figure 13.)   Not all theequipment inventory needs to be renewed at once. Equipmentenewal has to be carefully phased, and priorities agreed. We6.7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALhave bugun several new full development programmes in thepast year.   These decisions are described later in this chapterand some individual programme costs are given at paragraph 626.610. The demands of meeting an ever-increasing threat will pulltowards solutions which are sophisticated and therefore expensive.On the other hand the limitations on money must pull towardssimpler and cheaper solutions if the necessary range of equipmentsis still to be provided.   No one could afford to develop the bestpossible air-to-air missile if it meant that the aircraft to carryit fell short of the minimum requirement.    By the same tokenthere would be no point in developing a superb aircraft at a costwhich left no funds for equipping it with missiles.    The way toovercome such contradictions lies and has always lain, in athorough search for value for money: and in satisfying ourselves,particularly before projects enter full development, that cost-effective solutions for requirements have been identified. Thespecification of an equipment may also be influenced by consideratioof overseas sales potential or the opportunity for internationalcollaboration.611. Several techniques contribute to this.    Operational analysis(see page  &quot;      _/)  both of the best means of countering futurethreats and of proposed procurement solutions, plays a valuablerole.   The R&amp;D establishments (see page        J7)and industryalso make careful investigations of proposed equipments infeasibility and project definition studies, which reveal whetherthe necessary technological advances can be made and at a pricethat can be afforded.    Before any decision is taken to commencefull development these studies must be completed.    In developmentmuch emphasis is laid on economising in through-life costs. We6.8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALLook for high standards of reliability, easier maintenance and(as a result of advances in electronics and automation) economy inmanpower.   We also place great importance on developing equipmentthat can be improved during its lifetime to keep pace with thethreat.    This is known as having &apos;stretch potential*, and exploitingit is often much cheaper than introducing new equipment.612. The Statement on the Defence Estimates 1980 described theequipment programme comprehensively.    The sections that followconcentrate on the major equipment decisions that have been takenin the past year, or are envisaged for the coming year, and onsignificant new production orders or deliveries to the Servicesunder the three geographical headings used in Chapter 3; theCentral Region of Europe, the Eastern Atlantic and Channel, andthe United Kingdom base.    In addition, the opportunity is taken toexplain in more detail one area of very great importance - elec-tronic warfare (see page  ~      _7)  THE CENTRAL FRONT613. The high level of expenditure and effort that the Warsaw Pactis devoting to its own equipment programme has been described inihapter 1.    We can generally expect the Warsaw Pact at least to&lt;a.tch NATO in the technological sophistication of its weaponry,nd it has already demonstrated an ability in some areas to plan,evelop and introduce new systems more quickly than NATO. Inddition, its forces benefit from greater standardisation in weaponsystems.14. As was described in Chapter 3, armoured strength formshe key element in Warsaw Pact ground forces; modern tanks areupported by armoured personnel carriers, self-propelled guns andelf-propelled air defence systems.    This armour is supported furtherby helicopter gunships and tactical attack aircraft.    The Warsaw&apos;&quot;&quot;act&apos;s own airspace will be defended by aircraft and advanced6.9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALmissile systems.   Thus our essential requirement on the CentraFront is for forces capable of defeating the main Warsaw Pactarmoured and air attack and of penetrating sophisticatedair defences to strike at bases, airfields and second-echelonarmour and reinforcements.615. In the past year several decisions on equipment have beentaken which will greatly enhance the fighting ability of BAOR curingthe 1980s in main battle tanks, armoured personnel vehicles, airdefence equipment and artillery systems.   Major improvements inthe capability of Royal Air Force Germany will be secured soon withthe introduction of the Tornado GR1, production of which proceedssteadily.   Progress on particular programmes of note is set outbelow.616. Equipment for Ground Forcesa.     Main Battle Tanks.    The MBT 80 programme has been discontinuedin favour of introducing a new tank to be known as Challenger.This has resulted from a review of requirements in the lightof the latest assessment of the threat.   Whereas MBT 80 wouldnot have been available until the 1990s, Challenger will comeinto service much earlier and allow us to increase the totalnumber of tanks.    It will incorporate a number of technicaladvances, including Chobham armour and a more powerfuldiesel engine.    An initial order has been placed for sufficientChallenger to equip one of BAOR&apos;s four armoured divisions; thefinal number to be bought is yet to be decided, but the presentplanning assumption is that Challenger will replace up to halfof the existing Chieftains in BAOR.    Longer-term studies intothe replacement of the remaining Chieftains will encompass the6.10CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALpossibility of a collaborative project within NATO.   The policyof progressive improvement throughout in-service life whichhas been followed with Chieftain will, it is hoped, applyequally with Challenger.b. Anti-Armour Ammunition.    An improved armour-piercing round isto be introduced in the next few years for use with Chieftainand Challenger, and further work is aimed at procurement of anew anti-armour round, to enter service in the late 1980s.These steps will maintain effectiveness against improved Soviettank armour.c. Artillery Systems and Equipments.   Deployment of the newFH 70 155mm towed gun has recently been completed.   We arealso about to take delivery of an additional 69 BD.09 155mmself-propelled guns from the United States.    Together theseweapons will significantly increase the firepower of the1(BR) Corps artillery. , ,   . ,.J       Development work is continuingon the Battlefield Artillery Target Engagement System .(BATES)which will provide computer processing assistance in the controlof artillery systems, including such planned future systems asthe multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) and the SP 70self-propelled howitzer.Air to Ground Weapons.    The TOW long-range anti-tank guidedweapon (ATGW) system is about to enter service fitted to theLynx helicopter.   Helicopter-borne ATGW provide a rapid-reaction force to counter armoured thrusts.   Project definitionhas been completed on an advanced anti-armour weapon. A6.11CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALreview of the way ahead is now being undertaken which willalso take account of recent technological advances.   Devel 3pmenlof the JP233 airfield attack weapon continues.   The with-drawal of the United States from funding of this joint projectis disappointing, but the weapon still offers a cost-effectivesolution and we hope that the United States will reconsidertheir position on the project.Low Level Air Defence.   Delivery of Blindfire Rapier units willbe complete to both 1(BR) Corps and RAF Regiment squadrons bythe end of this year.   The system will be progressivelyimproved in the future.    Full development has begun of enhance-ments to the man-portable Blowpipe anti-aircraft missile;these take advantage of the latest technology and willconsiderably improve Blowpipe&apos;s effectiveness against futureenemy aircraft.Mechanised Combat Vehicle (MCV).   A new armoured personnelcarrier, MCV 80, began full development last year.    This willfromenter service /   the mid-1980s, replacing the greater part ofthe existing FV 430 series, which has been in service sincethe 1960s.   The infantry vehicle will mount a 30mm Rardencannon capable of destroying enemy light armour, and variantsare planned for other roles such as artillery observation,recovery and mortar fire.Communications.    The Ptarmigan trunk communications systemhas now entered production and will enter service in the mid-19803, replacing the Bruin system in BAOR.   It will providecomprehensive and resilient area communications, with automaticre-routing in the event of enemy damage.Chemical Warfare Defensive Equipment.    We are continuing with6.12CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALimprovements to our defensive measures, including protectivesuits and respirators and detection, monitoring anddecontamination equipment.,17. Equipment for Air ForcesTornado GR1.    The first deliveries to the Tri-NationalTraining Establishment at RAF Cottesmore were made last yearand the numbers are being steadily built up.   A fourth batchof aircraft has been authorised.   This will bring the numberof aircraft for the United Kingdom to 200, out of a plannedtotal of 220.   The first aircrew training course for front-linesquadrons will begin in the autumn and the first operationalsquadron is expected to start receiving crews next year.b. Harrier.   There are two contenders foriiie possible developmentof an improved version of the Harrier: the McDonnellDouglas/British Aerospace AV8B under development for theUnited States Marine Corps, and the British AerospaceGR5(K) design.   Evaluation of these two designs continues, andit is hoped that a decision will be made later this year.The support that the AV8B is receiving from the US Governmentis most encouraging, and provides the basis for a collabora-tive solution.   A combined Royal Air Force/US Marine Corpsorder for the aircraft would generate considerable work forthe British aerospace industry.   A programme of improvementsto increase the effectiveness of the existing Harrier GR3aircraft will be undertaken throughout the 1980s.c. Jaguar Replacement.   Last year a tri-national study reportedon the possibility of designing a single type of aircraft toreplace British and French Jaguars and Federal German Phantoms.This showed that considerable difficulties remained both inreconciling the different needs and in keeping to a reasonable6.13CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALcost.   Further studies are being undertaken.   It is uncertainwhether a collaborative solution would provide the best way-forward.d.     Support Helicopters.    We are improving helicopter supportand airlift in RAF Germany.   A Puma squadron (to replaceWessex helicopters) was deployed to Germany late last year.The first Chinook helicopters have now been delivered to theRAF.   The first squadron will form at RAF Odiham later thisyear before deploying to Germany in 1982.    Studies are in handfor a new light support helicopter.EASTLANT AND CHANNEL618. The scale and growth of Soviet maritime forces is a matte?of serious concern to the Alliance.    In a relatively short periodthe Soviet Navy has developed from primarily an offshore maritimeforce into a worldwide instrument of Soviet policy.    The resourcesdevoted to this transformation indicate the importance that theSoviet Union attaches to its maritime capability.   Chapter 1 hasdescribed some of the latest developments in the Soviet Navy: newand highly sophisticated submarines and surface ships are inproduction as are modern Backfire bombers equipped with long-rangestand-off missiles.    Our maritime strategy calls for well equippedsurface ships, fast, quiet submarines, effective radar and activesonar, and passive listening devices.   We also deploy shore-basedair defence, and strike/attack and maritime patrol aircraft,together with ship-borne fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters.619. Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Equipmenta.     Nuclear Powered Fleet Submarines.    The sixth and last Swift sureclass fleet submarine is about to enter service andHMS Trafalgar, the first of the next class, with improvedsonars and noise characteristics, will be launched later6.14CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthis year.   Two further vessels in this class are alreadyon order, and further orders are planned.Anti-Submarine Warfare Ships.   HMS Invincible, the firstof the three ASW carriers (planned to operate five Sea Harrieraircraft and nine Sea King helicopters) has now entered service.The second, HMS Illustrious,    is due to commence sea trialslater this year, and will be accepted by the Royal Navynext year; and the third, HMS Ark Royal, will be launchedshortly.   The third of the Type 22 Frigates, HMS Brilliant,is about to enter service; the fourth, HMS Brazen, has alreadybeen launched; and two more are under construction. Furtherorders are planned.   A programme is under way to give majorrefits to some of the Leander class frigates to equip themwith the Sea Wolf point defence missile system, Lynxhelicopter and improved sonar.New patrol submarine.    Design work is well advanced on a newclass of diesel-powered submarines and full development ofsome major equipments for this vessel, including sonar,fire control and weapon handling and launching equipment,has been set in hand.Future Torpedoes.   Prototypes of the British Sting Raylightweight ship or air-launched torpedo, are now undergoingtrials.   A decision is due later this year on a successor to thesubmarine-launched Tigerfish heavyweight torpedo.    This will betaken in the light of a project definition study now in progressto evaluate the two contenders; a British development, drawingon the advanced technology used in Sting Ray and a United Statesdevelopment of their Mk 48 torpedo.6.15CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALe. Anti-Submarine Warfare Technology.    A programme of researchand development is in hand to maintain the operationaleffectiveness of our submarine force.   It aims to improvethe range and discrimination of our active and passive sonarsand to reduce the detectability of our vessels despiteconsiderable Soviet progress in this area.f. Anti-Submarine Aircraft and Helicopters.    The Sea King Mk 5,will be introduced into two front-line squadrons during1981/82.   Studies are continuing with Italy into the prospectsfor a collaborative procurement of a successor. Deliveriesof the improved Nimrod Mk 2 maritime reconnaissance aircraftcontinue.g. Seabed Operations.    The seabed operations vessel (SOV)HMS Challenger will be launched shortly.620. Maritime Air Warfare Equipmenta. Aircraft.   Two Royal Navy Sea Harrier squadrons are nowin commission for service in the maritime strike/attack,fighter and reconnaissance roles.   One squadron is alreadyembarked in HMS Invincible and the second is due to embark inHMS Hermes later this year after her current refit. Fromthe mid-1980s the RAF Tornado F2 will begin to provideshore-based air defence cover for the Fleet, progressivelytaking this role over from Phantoms and Lightnings.b. Type 42 Destroyer.   HMS Exeter, the seventh ship of theType 42 class of guided missile destroyers, has now enteredservice.    Two further ships, HMS Liverpool and HMS Southamptonwill enter service in the coming year and five more are in6.16CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALvarying stages of construction.    These ships providearea air defence both for ASW task groups and for reinforce-ment and resupply shipping.621. Anti-Surface Vessel Equipmenti.     Sub-Harpoon.    The trials programme for the Sub-Harpoonanti-ship missile is under way.b.     Air launched Anti-Ship Missiles.    Development work on theSea Eagle anti-ship missile will continue, although furtherconsideration will be needed before its place in the programmecan be confirmed.    The Sea Skua missile will shortly enterservice in the Royal Navy&apos;s Lynx helicopters on board frigatesand destroyers.622. Communicationsa.     Satellite Communications.    These are becoming increasinglyimportant in the exercise of effective command and control,particularly for the Royal Navy.    Studies into the possibilityof procuring a new military communications satellite forthe mid-1980s are in hand.623. Amphibious Equipmenta.     Landing Craft.    Trials of the prototype of the new landingcraft are under way, though for financial reasons theorder planned for last year has been deferred.?HE HOME BASE24. The large number and improving quality of longer-rangesoviet aircraft increase the demands of defending the UnitedKingdom and of protecting our air routes and shipping lanes,/hich face a major threat from mines, torpedoes and missiles inunited Kingdom waters.6.17CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL625. Air defence is now receiving the attention it deserves aftera long period of relative neglect..   We are making a considerableinvestment in new aircraft, missiles, radars, command centresand communications, with the aim of developing an integrated airdefence system.   At the same time, our mine countermeasures andoffshore patrol forces are being improved with more new vessel;a. Tornado F2.   All three Tornado F2 development air defenceaircraft are now flying.    The first 18 production aircrafthave been authorised as part of the fourth batch of productionaircraft and will enter service with the Royal Air Forceduring the mid-1980s to replace initially the Lightning, andlater the Phantom.b. Future Air-to-Air Missiles.    It has been decided not to proceedwith development of an improved version of the Sky Flashmissile, but an important step has recently been taken towardsthe rationalisation of future air-to-air missiles for airdefence.    The governments of the United Kingdom, FederalGermany and the United States have signed a Memorandum ofUnderstanding under which it is proposed that the nextgeneration of short-range missiles will be developed inEurope and the next generation of medium-range missiles willbe developed in the United States.    The European partners andthe United States will each have the right to produce bothmissiles, where necessary under licence.    France mayparticipate later.    In support of this plan a technologydemonstrator programme for short-range air-to-air missilesis being undertaken.6.18CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALHawk.   The RAP has taken delivery of /J.SOJ of the 175Hawks on order.    Successful trials firings of Sidewindermissiles from the Hawk have recently been made as part of theplan to give the aircraft a local air defence role. Plighttrials of a modified aircraft are due to begin later thisyear.    Eventually over half the Hawk fleet will be able tocarry Sidewinder AIM 9L.Nimrod Airborne Early Warning (AEW)    The first Nimrod AEWdevelopment aircraft began an intensive test and developmentprogramme during the middle of last year, and made itsfirst public appearance at the Parnborough Air Show. Itis being joined by two further development aircraft.These three aircraft will later be refurbished to productionstandard.   The Nimrod&apos;s powerful sensors and comprehensivedata handling and communications systems will make a majorcontribution to Britain&apos;s air defence.   The full squadron of11 aircraft is planned to be operational in the mid-1980s.United Kingdom Air Defence G-round Environment (UKADGE).Orders for the first of the new radars for the major UKADGEre-equipment programme have been placed, and the hardening andmodernisation of the operations centres is under way. Acrucial component of the improved UKADGE is the datahandling and communication system which knits together thenetwork of radars and operations centres and the aircraftand missiles.    The order for this sytem was won last year bya British-based consortium comprising two British companiesand an American company.    The system will provide for datafrom the radars to be fed into the operations centres,automatically processed and displayed on consoles to the6.19CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALair defence control teams; it will be capable of improvementas requirements change.   Work has also started on the gradualreplacement of RAP ground communications in the United Kingdomwith a secure, survivable and integrated network to be knownas Uniter.    The network will use digital switches andtransmission systems and will be developed in stages overa 10-15 year period.f. Rapier Ground to Air Missile.    (See also paragraph 338.)Delivery of DN 181 Blindfire Rapier to RAP Regiment unitswill be complete by the end of this year.   This version ofRapier can be operated at night and in bad weather.g. Mine Countermeasures Vessels.   HMS Ledbury, the second of theHunt class has now been accepted into service.    The third,HMS Cattistock, will enter service later -ftiis year.   An orderhas been placed for four more vessels, bringing the total inservice or on order to nine.   Pre-feasibility studies intothe possibility of developing a new and cheaper design ofminehunter are in hand.    Tenders for minesweeping trawlershave been received and a decision should be made shortly.h. Offshore Patrol and Fishery Protection.   An order has beenplaced for two 75-metre offshore patrol vessels. Theseare both for fishery protection within the 200 mile UnitedKingdom extended fishery limits and for patrolling offshoreoil and gas installations.    The first of these vessels,HMS Leeds Castle, has already been launched and the second,HMS Dumbarton Castle, will follow shortly.    In addition tothe peacetime role, which is described in Chapter 5, thesevessels will be capable of tasks such as minelaying in warand will be equipped to refuel and launch helicopters.6.20CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIALDEFENCE SALES1. The Government has reaffirmed its- strong support for the saleof defence equipment overseas wherever this is compatible with theUnited Kingdom&apos;s political, strategic and security interests. Asa nation we have traditionally maintained a strong defence industryand devoted a higher proportion of our national resources to itthan many of our allies.    But the strength of this industrial basecannot economically be supported by the needs of our own Servicesalone.    There is consequently a powerful incentive for us tomaximise the return on industrial investment in defence.    At theIsame time countries with limited or less sophisticated defenceIindustries naturally look to-the United Kingdom and other indus-trialised nations to supply them with defence equipment.2. The Government firmly believes that there are both politicaland economic benefits to be derived from defence sales.   In politicalterms the provision of equipment to our allies and other friendlynations, often backed by military advice, training and support,contributes to international stability, underlines the importancei    which we attach to maintaining good relations, and helps to safe-guard important Western interests.    In economic terms defence salesrepresent some 25$ of the output of British defence equipmentindustry and sustain some 142,000 direct and indirect job oppor-tunities.    Moreover, with the increasing cost of military equipmentand continuing pressure on the defence budget, we need to build upoverseas markets in order to recover our investment in research anddevelopment, keep skilled design and production teams together, andobtain the benefits of larger production runs.    A significantproportion of defence sales consists of high-technology productswith a high added value.    It is very important for the UnitedKingdom to maintain its current capability in this area as a6.23CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALspringboard for future industrial development.   However, at atime of worldwide recession, the competition from othercountries with major defence industries is more intense thanever.   We need to ensure that our own industry can match thiscompetition and increase its share of the market.3. Major contracts obtained recently cover substantial ordersfor Jaguar and Rapier, as well as helicopters, fast patrolboats, artillery systems and a wide range of Army equipment.Defence sales also cover a variety of ancillary products suchas marine boilers, motor vehicles and communications systemsand there is a growing business in projects such as constructionwork, medical services, storage facilities and training andservicing contracts.    We estimate that receipts from all transac-tions will reach about  1500 million in 1981/82.   This is asignificant contribution to the balance of payments and representssome 2ifo of total British exports.    The Government believes thatthere is considerable scope for further increases in defence saleswithout provoking conflict or increasing international tension.4. The Defence Sales Organisation provides a wide range ofassistance to industry in promoting equipment and negotiatingcontracts with overseas customers.    This assistance includescollecting of market information, demonstrating equipment,providing expert military advice, training and support, stagingexhibitions, negotiating with overseas governments and formulatingpackages combining equipment, construction work, training, supportand other services.   Packages of this kind, which involvecontributions both from Government and industry, are often handledby International Military Services, a limited company which is thecommercial arm of the Defence Sales Organisation.6.24CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5,     The Government is actively reviewing the ways in which itcan assist industry in securing defence sales. However,successful sales depend on offering the right product, on theright terms and at the right time.   This can he achieved onlyby continuing partnership between Government and industry atevery stage in the procurement cycle.   The Government iscommitted to improving this partnership and believes thatprospects fi&gt;r defence sales will increase as a result.6.25CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALPERATIONAL ANALYSIS1. As costs of replacement weapons continue to rise and develop lent cycles lengthen,  it is increasingly important to decide howto allocate resources to obtain the best value for money. Paatiperational experience may be of only limited value in helping to takeuch decisions since it often cannot be applied to new threats.here is a need, therefore, for a systematicpproach which can assist in evaluating new operational conceptsaad tactics, an approach in which subjective and speculativeactors are reduced to a minimum.    Furthermore,  it would not beprudent to count on having time or opportunity in any future majorconflict to adjust concepts of operation, or to replace equipment thatproved to be inadequate.2. We must use every means at our disposal to helpmsure that we get both our operational concepts and our weaponfstem right first time.    Operational analysis in the Ministry ofdefence is an important part of this process and uses mathematicalnd other scientific techniques as an aid to rational andbjective choice.    It can be broken down into threeain categories:a. Assessment of specific weapon systems and of technologicalpossibilities.b. Studies predominantly of single Service activities - forinstance comparing the relative merits of different weaponsystems within the same tactical field.c. Longer term studies to aid resource allocation decisionson the forces required at sea,  on land and in the air.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL3. Operational analysis uses mathematical models and compute:&apos;simulations of operations to examine such questions as theeffects of introducing new systems and the importance of specificperformance characteristics - speed or range, for instance. Wargaming is also used and is particularly appropriate where thedetailed representation of tactics is required.   Where possibl ,data for studies are obtained from training exercises,but it issometimes necessary to hold specially devised trials.4. Operational analysis is centred on the Defence OperationalAnalysis Establishment (DOAE) at West Byfleet, but is also under-taken by single-Service scientific advisory groups and by teamslocated at certain of the R&amp;D establishments.   Studies haverecently been done at DOAE on the best mix of anti-armourweapons in the NATO Central Region, the best ways of usingoffensive air support,and the relative effectiveness of varyingcombinations of ships, aircraft, sensors and weapons in anti-submarine warfare in the Eastern Atlantic.CONFIDENTIALCXI
CONFIDENTIAL:&apos;HE GOVERNMENT&apos;S DEFENCE INDUSTRIES!he Royal Ordnance Factories|0      The Royal Ordnance Factories (ROFs) supply a significant proportionof the equipment used by our Armed Forces.    They are a large,lodern engineering enterprise operating under a trading fund. Thefactories are located at Birtley, County Durham; Bishopton,.enfrewshire; Blackburn, Lanes; Bridgwater, Somerset; Chorley,janes; Enfield, Middlesex; Glascoed, Gwent; Leeds, West Yorkshire;Nottingham; Patricroft, Manchester; and Radway Green, Crewe.Two further factories at Featherstone, Staffs and Powfoot, Dunfriesanaged by industry.

They make an increasing contributionto design and development.   Particular emphasis is being placed on he establishment of links with companies on the continent andin the United States,with an eye to practicable and profitablecollaboration.2. Although 39$ of the ROFs&apos; output by value during 1979-80 wasfor export, the continuing effect of the loss of the Iranianarket coupled with difficult trading conditions abroad and annprecedented level of unrest over pay have led to disappointingrading results in the year.3. The Government is studying all possible lines of futureievelopment for the ROF Organisation and in particular thejcope for privatisation.     A study group has reported and itsrecommendations are being considered.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Royal Dockyards4. The five Royal Dockyards at Devonport, Portsmouth, Chatham,Rosyth and Gibraltar together constitute the largest industrialenterprise within central government. ( 5ee Fig 14). They play avital role in maintaining, repairing, refitting and modernising theFleet.5. Over the past year the Royal Dockyards have been relativelyfree of industrial troubles.   However, their performance, likethat of other management areas in the Ministry of Defence, hasbeen affected by the constraints imposed to keepexpenditure within cash limits. Moreover,although it has been easier to attract the skilled labour thatthe Dockyards require, restrictions on Civil Service recruitmenthave largely prevented the Dockyards from exploiting suchopportunities.6. Last August, the Government issued a consultative documentsetting out the findings and recommendations of a study into therole, organisation and structure of the Royal Dockyards. TheGovernment noted the recommendations of the report, whichrepresent a complex and inter-connected framework for furtheraction and raise issues that stretch beyond the Dockyards them-selves.   Much further work will be required before the Governmentcan reach firm decisions.    The views of other interested partieshave been sought and a large number of organisations and individualhave responded.    Most have supported thestudy&apos;s recommendations, which are now beingdiscussed in detail with those principally concerned.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALELECTRONIC WARFARE (EW)1. The Soviet Union and her allies recognise the importance ofradio and the electromagnetic spectrum in warfare.   Their doctrineof radio electronic combat support (RECS) envisages attacking theenemy&apos;s command, control and communication systems and otherjensors such as radar   by electronic or physical means, whileproviding protection for their own electronic systems. Inaddition, the Soviet main intelligence directorate (GRU) controlsa large and comprehensive signal intelligence organisation whichis tasked against NATO&apos;s communications and radars in both peaceand war.    The Soviet Union is thus well placed to exploit elec-tronic systems, and RECS substantially enhances the effectivenessof their other weapon systems.2. There is a pressing need for NATO investmentin EW, particularly (electronic counter-countermeasures)(ECCM)systems, which help prevent interference with ourtransmissions.    The Services are procuring a wide variety of EWequipment.    This includes, in addition to ECCM systems, electronicsupport measures (ESM) systems, which intercept and analyse enemyelectronic transmissions, and electronic countermeasures (ECM)ystems, which disrupt and degrade them..     The RAF&apos;s programme includes the provision of electronicsurveil-ance equipment for the Nimrod is both the AEW and MR Mk 2 version, and thisis proceeding satisfactorily.    The RAF&apos;s main tactical EW taskis to protect its aircraft from surface to air missiles, anti-aircraft artillery and air defence fighters.    To counter these threatsthe Tornado GR1 will be fitted with automatic radar warningnd jamming equipments a chaff dispenser, and countermeasuresnfra-red homing missiles.    Similar equipments are being consideredforae Harrier and Jaguar, and a chaff dispensing pod has already:sen ordered for the Harrier.CONFIDENTIALi.Zc
CONFIDENTIAL4. EW is playing an increasing role in the Fleet, andsubstantial improvements in this area are planned for ships,submarines and aircraft.    These include Seagnat, a new ship-borne system for decoying anti-ship missiles, the round forwhich is being developed in the United States by five NATOcountries; new ship borne jammers; and new and improved threatalert receivers, which provide ships with earlywarning of hostile radar emissions.5. For the land battle, 1(BR) Corps now includes EW support inthe form of an EW battalion.   A programme of studieson every aspect of land EW is being undertaken to guidefor future procurement of new ESM and ECM systems. Communicationsystems of all three Services are being improved and made ECMresistant.6. If our forces are not adequately equipped with EW systemsattrition rates will be unacceptably high and much of ourcommand and control capability impaired.   Provided EW systemscan be developed and improved fast enough to keep pace with thethreat, EW systems make a vital and cost-effective contributionto our overall capability.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL. lESEARCH1. Advaxices in science and technology make&gt;ossible increased combat effectiveness andcreate possibilities for entirely new militarycapabilities and tactics.   Defence research, complementing thewider field of civil research, is carried out to promote advancesof particular benefit to defence and to provide a sound basis foridvice to those making major operational and equipment procurementdecisions.    In the United Kingdom defence research is carried outpartly under contract in industry and at the universities andpartly at the Ministry of Defence&apos;s own establishments. TheMinistry of Defence also manages research programmes,notably inthe field of aerospace, on behalf of a number of other departmentson a repayment basis.    Furthermore R&amp;D often provides a usefulMspin off&quot; in the civil field.   A recent example involved inves-tigation at petrochemical installations of the fire hazardsarising from high-powered radio and radar transmissions. Thiswork has greatly improved understanding of a potential disasterrisk in both land-based and off-shore installations, and has ledto a major reassessment of the safety standards involved.2. As part of the radical review of uivil serviceactivities launched by the Government in 1979, the Minister ofState for Defence chaired a major study whose main aim was to &quot;jestablish whether Government was undertaking activities which -ould be more appropriately and more effectively performed inindustry or elsewhere.    The study concluded that industrymight well be able to take on some of the work on design,development and project supportCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALnow done intramurally.   The study also suggested that bettervalue for money might possibly be achieved by contracting outa range of domestic and technical supporting services and thatthese possibilities should be tested.   Both these recommendationswere expected to yield further Civil Service manpower reductionsin addition to the 15$ reduction   achieved between1974 and 1980, including 5$ since 1979.3. The study also recommended a switch of resources to achievea modest increase in effort within the R&amp;D establishments onlong-term research, systems research,and work to formulateconcepts for new weapons systems as a precursor to the definition o:new requirements. This recommendation reflects an awarenessof research as the source of innovation and ideas on which theeffectiveness of future weapons must depend, particularly in thoseareas of technology where the threat is most formidable. Forexample, our future anti-tank capability will be improved byresearch now in progress on detector and microprocessor systemsfor application in precision-guided sub-munitions, which aredispersed from the main projectile to strike accurately at a numberof separate targets.    This development should facilitate thedestruction of enemy tank formations before they reachthe battle zone.Defence Scientific Advisory Council4. Following the decision to disband the Aeronautical and theElectronics Research Councils as result of the review of non-departmental public bodies (Cmnd 7797), the Defence ScientificAdvisory Council has been reorganised.    The Council will nowsurvey the full sweep of defence science and technology througha number of &quot;technology boards&quot;, which will concern themselvesprimarily with the defence research programme.    The new arrangementCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALwhich came into effect in September 1980, are working well,bringing a wide range of academic and industrial abilitiesto bear on problems in defence research anddevelopment.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL7. PEOPLE701. Manpower is the basic resource on which our defence depends.But it is expensive: so much so that serious tensions arise indefence expenditure between the need to recruit and retain theright number of men and women and the need to provide the rightkind of equipment.   Over recent years the share of the defencebudget spent on equipment has tended to rise and that on personnelto fall; and in 1981-82 (see Table 2.1 of Volume II) the equipmentshare is for the first time forecast actually to exceed that onpersonnel.    This trend has brought personnel spending within thedefence budget under stronger pressure and ever closer scrutiny.It also throws into sharp relief the growing importance of thereserve and auxiliary forces.702. Personnel policy is concerned with men and women both as aresource and as individuals.    It deals not only with manpowerplanning and strengths, skill categories and the matching ofresources to tasks but also with people&apos;s pay, conditions of service,accommodation and general welfare.    Bad handling of pay and otherconditions can damage not only morale but also recruitment, and thechances that we shall have the men and women we need to ensure theeffectiveness of British defence.703. This chapter discus.ses the Services first, and then civilians.The distinction is convenient, but in some ways artificial: itimplies a separation of tasks and roles which does not always exist.There are innumerable areas where civilians and service people workside by side and where the function of one is inseparable from thatof the other.    For instance, the effectiveness of the Britishstrategic nuclear deterrent force depends not only on the sailors whotake the submarines to sea, but also on the dockyard workers at7.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALRosyth who refit them; the civilians of the Royal Naval Supplyand Transport Service at the Royal Naval Armaments Depot, Coulport,who store the missiles; and the scientists and technicians whowork to improve the systems.SERVICE MEN AND WOMEN704. The United Kingdom is the only major European NATO member torely entirely on volunteer armed forces.    To maintain such a forcewe must first attract and recruit the right number and right qualityof men and women, and then keep them long enough to instil and reapfull benefit from their essential skills and experience.    The payaward made immediately the Government came to office greatly improvedthe chances of doing this.    It led to improvements in both the numberand quality of new recruits in 1979/80 which have been sustained in1980/81.   Higher recruitment and a drop in requests for earlyrelease have together begun to close the gap between the number oftrained Servicemen and women we need and the number we have. Thepace at which the process continues will depend on a number offactors including financial constraints.    Full details of thesetrends and of Services strengths are given in Volume 2.RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION705. The final figure for Services recruitment in 1979/80, some50,700, represented a peak matched only once in the last 17 years.Between April and December 1980 recruitment was 8$ higher than inthe equivalent period in 1979.   In 1979/80 only 45,042 men andwomen left the Services: 9$ less than in the previous year, and thelowest figure since the end of the last war.   In April-December 1980some 29,000 people left the Services, a 15$ reduction over the sameperiod in 1979.706. So recruiting is going well and the Services can look for highstandards among those who apply.    But there are still shortages7.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALin certain skills, many of which are also in demand in civilianlife.   Shortfalls exist in the Royal Navy in the seaman andengineer specialisations for both officers and ratings; in theArmy in trades such as electronic warfare operator and terminalequipment technician in the Royal Signals; and in several tradesin the Army Medical Services.    In the Royal Air Force there arestill shortages of junior officer pilots and in the engineering,fighter control and medical specialisations.   Even with improvedrecruiting it takes time to replace lost experience.    The shortagesof artificers in the Royal Navy, of commissioned and non-commissionedofficers in the RAF, and of captains and majors in several corps ofthe Army will not diminish significantly until later in the decade.707. The time needed to train a highly skilled Serviceman is notdissimilar to the long lead-times for sophisticated equipment. Boththe equipment programme and the personnel programme can take manyyears to recover if in any one period they lose the continuity ofreplacement and renewal.   Neither programme can be curtailed toallow for growth in the other without serious long-term consequencesfor our defence capabilities.708. Demographic trends seem likely to make recruiting more difficultin the future.    In 1979/80 the numbers of young men recruited bythe Armed Forces in 1979/80 represented about 10$ of those enteringthe 16-19 age group, considerably above the average of about8i$ over the five years up to 1978/9.    On present plans theServices may be expected to need about 46,000 recruits each yearover the next decade.    To obtain those numbers we shall have torecruit 9-10$ of the young men entering the appropriate age groupat the start of the decade, and even higher percentages in thelater years, as Figure 15 shows.    We shall therefore have tokeep up the successful recruiting effort of the last eighteen monthsfor a good few years yet.7.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL709. Recruiting is only half the story: the value of recruitsdepends on how long they can be persuaded to stay.   Pay has adecisive influence here.    The maintenance of pay comparabilitynot only means justice for the Services, who are not in a positionto negotiate their own pay award, but also offers the best wayto ensure that manning levels are maintained.   The Governmentendorses the concept of the Military Salary, under which theServices are paid the appropriate rate for the job and in turnpay a fair price for food and accommodation.    It is important thatboth pay and charges are independently assessed, and we see theArmed Forces Pay Review Body as the best means of achieving this.710. But money is not-the only factor.   Many young people arereluctant to commit themselves initially to a long career. Ourterms of service must allow for this, or useful recruits will belost.   There is obviously a minimum length of service below whichit is not usually cost-effective to recruit and train, but theivis still scope for new terms of service which both attract theindividual and provide a satisfactory return.   For example, thisyear the Royal Navy introduced a new three-and-a-half-year shortcareer commission for seamen officers and reduced the Royal Marines&apos;five-year commission to four years.    The same approach is beingadopted in new schemes to find the right kind of graduates. Underthe new university bursary schemes the student receives a smallermonetary award than under a traditional cadetship, but unlike acadet he remains a civilian until after graduation and his subsequentcommitment to service is shorter.711. This flexibility can also be extended to later stages ofservice.    A member of the Armed Forces is unlikely ever to enjoyquite the same freedom as a civilian to join and leave his employmentbut it makes sense to avoid unnecessary disincentives. The7.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALRoyal Air Force, for example, has recently introduced a secondoptional retirement point for officers in their mid-forties,and the Royal Navy now offers a wide choice of terms of servicefor officers and men who have left and wish to re-enter theService.    Ratings who extend their service beyond 22 years may,for instance, opt to remain in one location ashore if a suitablejob is available.    The Army offers similar flexibility.712. For people already in the Service, it is part of any goodemployer&apos;s responsibility to maintain satisfactory working, welfareand social conditions.   This applies the more strongly in thoseoccupations - the Armed Services being the prime example - whereunusual disciplines and demands must be imposed.    The Governmentwill continue to look for further improvements, though with dueregard to the present financial climate.713. We hoped last year to introduce schemes for financial assistancewith private house purchase, and also a scheme to enable servicemenand women to buy surplus married quarters at discounted prices inline with the arrangements for council house tenants under the 1980Housing Act. But as with other employers, the Government&apos;s abilityto bear increased personnel costs at this time is strictly limited.We are therefore not yet able to introduce these schemes; thoughit remains our intention to do so as soon as the financial situationpermits.   In the meantime we have introduced from 1 April this yeara scheme to give priority in the sale of surplus married quartersto buyers within the Services.714. The introduction of the Forces&apos; Railcard Scheme launched on1 July 1980 on a trial basis until the end of 1982, has provedparticularly welcome.    It allows Service personnel, and theirimmediate families, subject to some minor restrictions, to travelat half-fare so that families can be reunited more cheaply andmore often. ^ 5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL715. A large proportion of Service men and women are less thanthirty years old.   For them particularly, sports and recreationfacilities are important; and the Services provide opportunitiesto learn and participate in virtually any kind of sport as well asa wide range of cultural and recreational activities. Servicesports facilities are made available regularly for civiliancompetitive club and international meetings.716. Table 6.11 of Volume 2 of this Statement gives details ofsome other important &apos;social1 services provided both by the Governmendirectly and by independent organisations such as the Navy, Armyand Air Force Institute (NAAFI).    In an occupation which involvesfrequent and sometimes sudden moves, and which concentratespeople on or near bases often remote from centres of population,it can mean a great deal to have shops and entertainment closeat hand.ARMED FORCES BILL717. The Army Act 1955, the Air Force Act 1955 and the NavalDiscipline Act 1957 provide a statutory basis for the disciplinarysystems of the Armed Forces.    They are subject to a five-yearlyreview by Parliament, which authorises their continuance throughthe enactment of an Armed Forces Bill.   Each new Armed Forces Billprovides an opportunity to keep Service procedures in line withcivilian practice, so far as the special characteristics of militaryactivities permit, and also to remedy any omissions or anomalies.Such a Bill is currently being considered by Parliament.THE RESERVES718. Regular forces, scarce and expensive as they are, must besupplemented by adequate reserves.    The part played by theTerritorial Army (TA) in last year&apos;s Exercise CRUSADER underlinedthe vital role of reserve forces and the high state of training and7.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALreadiness which they need to maintain.   Over the past year aprincipal aim of the Government has been to build upon the recruitiboom which followed the improvements in bounties and otherconditions of reserve service announced in August 1979. Highmorale should encourage more trained volunteers to prolong theirservice.   While improving training and equipment within thevolunteer forces, we have tried also to foster a positive attitudetowards them in the community as a whole and to stress thecontribution civilians can make to the nation&apos;s defence on apart-time basis.   Nowhere is the essential link between theServices and the community more clearly expressed than in ourvolunteer reserves.719. In all three Services there is a constant effort to makebetter and more flexible use of reservists.   In the Royal NavyReserve (RNR) and the Royal Marines Reserve (RMR) both recruitmentand retention   have improved; more training is being done andstandards are rising correspondingly.    The RNR (Air) Branch whichwas announced last year has now come into being.720. The strength of the TA has continued to grow since bountieswere increased, and the force is better manned than at any timesince the 1967 reorganisation.   Wastage is still too high but thislong-standing problem can only be overcome by the Government&apos;spolicy of consistent support outlined above.    The past year hasseen the first issues to the TA of Clansman radios.    The two FieldRegiments and Commando Battery have been re-equipped with the105 mm Light Gun, and the three Air Defence Regiments with theBlowpipe air defence missile.    In addition the TA is shortly toreceive the Milan anti-tank weapon.7.7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL721. The RAF Volunteer Reserve and the Royal Auxiliary Air Fort.(R Aux AF) have an important and expanding function in support ofthe Royal Air Force.    Recruitment has gone very well in the threeR Aux AF Regiment Squadrons, which were formed on a trial basisin 1979 to assist in the defence and security of airfields in theUK.   They have reached good standards of training and should beable to make a significant contribution in their intended role.The trial R Aux AF programme is being carefully monitored with aview to possible further expansion.722. In the regular reserves, an initial issue of uniforms hasbeen made to Army reservists under the new Individual ReinforcementPlan.   These arrangements will eventually cover more than 50,000soldiers and, together with the new system of local reporting oncall-out, will halve the time taken to mobilise them.    We willshortly introduce provisions for members of the Women&apos;s RoyalArmy Corps to serve a period of reserve service when they leavethe Army.    This brings them into line with their male colleagues.In due course we intend to bring forward a scheme to make itpossible for suitably experienced TA soldiers to volunteer for aperiod of reserve service in the same way as regular soldiers.This would harness the talent of those volunteers who for somereason may be unable to continue to meet their full TA trainingcommitment.THE WOMEN&apos;S SERVICES723. The boost which manpower shortages gave to moves to extendthe role of women in the Armed Forces has been sustained overthe past year.   The Army has completed the first part of a reviewof all establishments to identify posts which could be filledequally well by men or women.    So far,  some 500 officer and4,000 soldiers&apos; posts previously filled by men have been put in this7.8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALcategory: about 400 of them are already being filled by women.The number of suitably qualified women available, together with thegeneral manning situation, will determine the number of &apos;dual&apos;posts they occupy at any one time.    A similar review is inhand for the TA.724. In those areas of the Royal Navy where members of iiie Women&apos;sRoyal Naval Service (WRNS) are already employed, an increasingnumber of posts are being opened to either sex.    The main constraintis that a number of posts ashore must be reserved for men returningfrom sea duties, to preserve a balance between sea and shoreservice; and for the most part women cannot serve at sea. WRNSFleet Analysis Officers and Weapons Analysis Ratings do, however,frequently go to sea on a daily basis, and WRNS Air Mechanicshave gone to sea with their squadron on board the Royal FleetAuxiliary Engadine and are likely to do so again.   During thenext decade the requirement for WRNS ratings will increase by over25$ and for officers by some 40$ as the planned range of theirduties expands.   As for the RAF, members of the Women&apos;s Royal AirForce do not belong to a separate female establishment and alreadycompete directly with men in a wide range of jobs.THE ARMING OF WOMEN725. The Government has announced that some members of the WRACand the WRAF will be trained in the use of arms for defensivepurposes.    This step was taken only after the deepest considerationand after weighing public views, including the comments made inParliament and outside on the ideas in last year&apos;s Statement. Mostof those who commented believed that the arming of ServLcewomen ona limited scale was sensible, timely and should go ahead. Thedecision now taken does not mean that women are to be employed incombat units; it remains the Government&apos;s policy that they should7.9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALnot be.   But in the Army women do certain jobs in which theyat present have to be guarded by armed men, and if the womencan themselves be armed these men can be freed for other tasks.In the Royal Air Force, women trained in the use of arms can nowbe employed in the defence of air stations.   As last year&apos;sStatement made clear, the options for employing WRNS personnelare not critically dependent on arming them; it remains possible,however, that they will undertake operational duties short ofcombat.CADET FORCES726. The Cadet Forces have long been recognised as an importantsource of recruitmentfbr the Armed Forces.    Last year we announcedthat an experimental scheme had been introduced to allow girls tojoin selected Army Cadet Force detachments in schools.    A companiontrial scheme has since started for the Air Training Corps, sothat girls now participate in the Cadet Forces of all threeServices.SERVICES TRAINING727. There is an enormous range of skills available in the BritishArmed Forces.   In the Army alone there are no less than 230, rangingfrom combat soldier to cook, sniper to avionics artificer. Thelong training times needed to establish and maintain such expertisehave already been mentioned: as in civil life, the highest quali-fications can take several years to acquire.    The forms of trainingalso vary widely, from the achievement of purely military skills,through formal instruction courses and on-the-job training, to theacquisition of civil qualifications and diplomas.728. Apart from the direct usefulness of these skills to theServices, the professional image which they foster helps bothrecruitment and retention.    The use of skills also promotes jobsatisfaction and raises morale.   Overseas training facilities7.10CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALsuch as those at Suffield in Canada are particularly valuable inoffering realistic operational situations.    But the skills acquiredby Servicemen and women are also of interest to the generalcommunity.   They can, for example, be used to help and protectthe public in all the ways described in Chapter 5.   They alsotend to attract outside employers.   The outflow of trainedpersonnel into industry contributes to the national reservoir ofskilled manpower, and in that sense the Service&apos;s loss is thecommunity&apos;s gain.   However, the premature loss of skilled peoplefrom the Services is a serious drain on defence resources particu-larly given the cost and effort needed to train replacements.Hence the importance of the efforts to improve retention (seeparas 709-712).729. We are increasing cooperation in training with our NATOallies.   A major milestone was the opening in July 1980 of theTri-national Tornado Training Establishment at RAF Cottesmore,where pilots from Italy and the Federal Republic of Germany, aswell as the Royal Air Force, will learn to fly the Tornado GR1.The Royal Air Force, along with most other NATO nations, alsoplans to participate in a new jet pilot training scheme due tostart this autumn in the United States.730. A study is now almost complete into officer training at theRoyal Military Academy, Sandhurst.    It has considered:- the length of the initial military training at Sandhurst.- changes in the Regular Careers Course.- the merging of the two major graduate courses into one.- the functional incorporation of the WRAC college.Any changes agreed are likely to be introduced in 1982.7.11CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALHIGHER DEFENCE STUDIES731. The Ministry of Defence finances a number of defence lecture-ships designed to stimulate defence studies at the universities andto increase professionalism in defence.   In 1980 two new lecture-ships were established at Cambridge: one to specialise in the studyof air power. ; Under a scheme started in 1980 five officers arecurrently taking the one-year M Phil degree course in internationalrelations at Cambridge; this should help officers of good careerpotential to broaden their knowledge and develop intellectually,,CIVILIANS732. The analysis of the skills of civilian staff set out in lastyear&apos;s Statement brought out the primarily executive, as againstadministrative or regulatory, nature of Civil Service work in theMinistry of Defence.    The Ministry&apos;s civilians play a key part inall aspects of defence activity: in the refinement and applicationof the policies outlined in Part One of this Statement; in supportof the roles and activities described in Parts Two and Three;and in the financial management described in Part Four.CIVILIAN NUMBERS733. The Ministry of Defence (including Royal Ordnance Factories)employs at present some 267,300 civilians,  of whom 231,400 arebased in the United Kingdom.    This represents approximatelyone third of the Home Civil Service and includes three-quartersof all industrial civil servants.   The overall size of the Britishdefence establishment is similar to that of West Germany and France,but our all-volunteer and all-regular Armed Forces imply aproportionately greater role for civilians.    Tasks which elsewherewould be undertaken by conscripts are in Britain performed byestablished civil servants.    This almost certainly works outcheaper and reduces the disruption involved in heavy and recurring7.12CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALtraining of new recruits.   Civilians provide vital backing forthe ability of the Armed Forces to operate in peacetime and war,and are closely integrated with military personnel throughout theMinistry and throughout the Armed Forces.734. The Government also requires the Ministry of Defence to makethe most efficient use possible of its manpower and to contributeto the overall aim of reducing the size of the Civil Service. TheMinistry is working towards a target of 200,000 United-Kingdom-basedcivilians at 1 April 1984, compared with a strength of 247,660 at1 April 1979.    To complete this reduction in the least damagingway while maximising efficiency means examining every corner ofthe Department&apos;s activity.   Much has already been done to streamlinestaffing requirements, and over the last decade a wide range ofproductivity schemes has been introduced for industrial personnel.These efforts will continue.    Increasing attention is also beingturned on a number of areas in support services to see if thecommercial sector can be more fully involved, by contracting outareas of work to industry or transferring entire functions. Weare also thinking of rationalising management organisation incertain support areas, and relaxing certain controls, in order tomake best use of limited and expensive manpower.735. There will be full consultation with trade unions aboutreductions.   Selective use is being made of recruitment controlsand voluntary retirement to reduce the impact of cuts, butredundancy for some staff will be unavoidable.736. The target of 200,000 staff in post for 1 April 1984 hasbeen mentioned above.    For comparison, the numbers of UK-based7.13CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALcivilians currently provided for in the Defence Estimates (withthose employed and separately funded in the Royal Ordnance Factory(ROF) organisation) are:1 April 1981        31 March 1982MOD 210,300 203,000ROF Organisation 21,100 20,600Total 231,400 223,600Provision is also made in the Estimates for 35,892 staff locallyengaged overseas on 1 April 1981 and 35,431 on 31 March 1982.737. Since the Government took office civilian numbers (includingROFs) will have been reduced by 18,552 (6.5$) in comparisonwith the 1 April 1981 provision, and a further reduction of 8,261 isplanned during 1981/82.    This will bring the total reduction to26,813 (9.4$), made up of 24,040 reductions (9.7$) in UK-basedcivil servants and 2,773 (7.3$) in locally-engaged civilians.738. These numbers reflect the reductions made in 1979/80 and1980/81 to meet the cash limit restrictions on civilian pay inthose years.   During the forthcoming year the Ministry will alsocomplete its commitment, announced by the Minister of Stateat the Civil Service Department on 6 December 1979, to reducestaff numbers by 7,500 by 1 April 1982 by various economies.These measures include contracting out some domestic supportfunctions, especially cleaning; administrative savings fromrevised procedures for processing contractors&apos; bills; and furtherchanges in quality assurance arrangements, placing greaterreliance on industry.    They are more fully described in Chapter 8.Economies in headquarters staff are being pursued vigorously andwill also contribute to the reductions.    In addition to the 10$reduction under the 1974 Defence Review, a further 10$ reductionin civilian and military staff is aimed at by 1 April 1982.7.14CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALPAY AND PRODUCTIVITY739. The pay of Ministry of Defence (MOD) civilians is in generalsettled as the result of the Civil Service central pay negotiations.Fewer trained people were lost to outside employers during 1980,and this trend should continue during 1981. A number of specificproblems on pay structure (eg differentials between supervisorsand supervised) have, however, needed special study.740. The Ministry of Defence is the largest Civil Service employerof industrial labour, with about 117,000 employees in the RoyalDockyards, ROFs, stores, engineering, R&amp;D and other establishmentsengaged primarily in serving the Armed Forces.    Given such numbers,the Ministry of Defence has always attached great importance toefficiency in its industrial establishments.    Within almost alldefence establishments with industrial employees, some kind ofproductivity agreement is now operating to achieve more flexibleworking practices and reduction of the manpower needed for a giventask.   By helping reduce the size of the support &quot;tail&quot;, theseschemes make more money available for the &quot;teeth&quot;.741. Outside the ROFs, the bulk of industrial work in defenceestablishments is non-repetitive and therefore difficult to measure.Productivity schemes based on work measurement do however operatein the Royal Dockyards, larger depots of the Royal Naval Supply andTransport Service, Royal Naval Aircraft Yards, Royal Electrical andMechanical Engineers (REME) Central and Command Workshops, thelarger Royal Army Ordnance Corps (RAOC) stores and the engineeringand stores depots of RAF Support Command.   About 30,000 industrialemployees were on such schemes in 1980 and the involvement of thetotal workforce is steadily growing.    Plans are well in hand tointroduce new work measured schemes, more in keeping with management&apos;sneeds, in the four Royal Dockyards in this country.7.15CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALRECRUITMENT AND TRAINING742. Selective restrictions on recruitment, rigorously applied,have played an important part in controlling manpower costs ove.the last twelve months.   They are less expensive and less damagingto morale than a large programme of compulsory redundancies. Inimplementing them we have taken care to protect key areas of thdefence effort, such as the strategic nuclear deterrent, and tokeep up recruitment of suitably qualified specialist staff, suchas engineers, scientists, computer programmers, systems analystsand management accountants.   A table illustrating the inflowand outflow of the various grades of civilian staff is given atFigure 16.743. The Ministry of Defence has more apprentices under training -8,000 - than any other single employer in Britain.    Some 1,000 aretechnician apprentices and many progress to take higher diplomas,certificates and degrees in engineering subjects.    In 1980 manpowerand expenditure constraints held the total entry of craft andtechnician apprentices to some 2,000, lower than the peak reachedin previous years and less than the places available in trainingschools.    Recruitment was, however, kept as high as possible bothto provide opportunities for school-leavers and to ensure a skilledworkforce for the future.   The training given encompasses a widerange of skills, covering the latest technology in fields such asaerospace, warship design, military vehicles, and the associatedresearch and development.   It is highly regarded in outsideindustry and many MOD apprentices in fact leave for other jobssoon after finishing their training.    This represents a bonus forthe nation&apos;s industrial capacity, although at some cost to theMinistry of Defence.7.16CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL744. Training is an essential element in the career development ofstaff in all grades and specialisations.    Increased emphasis isnow placed on functional training (eg personnel management, projectmanagement, finance, and ADP) and on management training inindustrial relations.   In the Administration Croup, greater functionalspecialisation and professionalism is vital if we are to continueto cope with the growing complexity of the tasks of defence.Suitable staff are encouraged and helped to obtain externalqualifications relevant to their professional skills.MANAGEMENT STUDIES745. The Ministry of Defence aims to develop continuously theskills required by its managerial staff, and to give staff greaterresponsibility and personal accountability.   A key objective isthe elimination of excess bureaucracy.   The recent study of theRoyal Dockyards, for example, found that with less (and moredevolved) management and a cut in planning and paperwork, thestructure could be streamlined to produce more direct supervisionand executive action, more accountability and responsibility, andimproved job quality in general.    Studies in other areas ofsupport activity are reaching similar conclusions.746. Two studies have also been launched into management hierarchieswithin the Department.    One study, covering middle managementgrades from Higher Executive Officer to Assistant Secretary, willlook for ways to make best use of managerial ability at all levelsthrough shorter chains of command and wider spans of responsibility.A second study will analyse current financial control proceduresand see how they can be simplified to achieve clearer responsibilitiesand better accountability.    The Ministry is also looking ahead to the7.17CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALapplication of advanced office technology to assist the work ofexecutive, clerical and secretarial grades.    Since 1960, pay,personal records, supply and accounting have been transferred tocomputer systems.   The focus is now on the application of newtechnology including communicating word processors, advancedreprographic and facsimile equipment, and mini - and micro -computers.7.18CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE CIVILIAN WORK FORCE1. The Ministry of Defence employs about one third of the HomeCivil Service.    It employs such large numbers partly because itis an executive department running a considerable number ofmajor businesses, and partly because our forces are allregular: we employ civilians in Britain to release servicemenfor front-line duties and to carry out many tasks which are doneby national servicemen in other NATO countries.2. Among the Ministry&apos;s industrial concerns are the RoyalOrdnance Factories, which produce a whole range of equipment -from tanks to radio components - for the Forces; the RoyalDockyards which refit the Royal Navy&apos;s ships and submarines;the REME Workshops which maintain and repair the Army&apos;s vehicles;the Aircraft Repair and Maintenance Units of the RAF; and theR&amp;D Establishments.    Among the tasks which civilians carry outin place of servicemen are those of policemen, firemen, drivers,cooks, instructors, mechanics, storemen, computer operators,and clerks.3. To carry out such a wide range of functions the Ministry ofDefence requires an equally wide range of skills.   Over half ofthe UK-based staff - some 117,000 - are industrials, of whomsome 38,000 are craftsmen (welders, plumbers, fitters, boiler-makers, blacksmiths, carpenters, armourers, radio techniciansetc).    There are 8,000 apprentices, whose numbers have been main-tained despite the overall reductions - partly to help provide aflow of craftsmen for the future and partly to provide jobopportunities for the young.4. Of the 114,000 UK-based non-industrials some 35,500 arescientists and technologists who provide the expertise neededin such areas as the R&amp;D Establishments, the Dockyards, and the1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALROFs, and some 32,500 are specialists such as teachers (forchildren of servicemen overseas), instructors, data processors,policemen and communications operators.   Clerical andsecretarial back-up for the whole organisation (35,000) anda surprisingly small number (11,000) of administrative andexecutive grades make up the balance.    The great majority of thislast group is engaged in executive functions such as bill-paying,letting contracts, computer operations and programming, andproject and personnel management.5. This large civilian workforce is administered by relativelyfew senior managers.    This reflects in part the structure of theworkforce and in part the determined efforts made to secureefficiency at the highest levels.    The number of civilian postsat Under Secretary level and above is now down to 104, a ratioof 1 to 2200 staff: that of the Civil Service outside theMinistry of Defence is 1:700.6. To achieve a reduction of nearly 48,000 UK-based staff(nearly 20$) over five years, which is the target set by theGovernment, will inevitably mean cuts across the whole spectrumof activity.    It is not, and cannot be, just a matter of &apos;cuttingback the bureaucracy&apos;.   Instead we have to cut out what is lessessential and streamline our operations at all levels and in allareas, handing over to private industry wherever it is moreefficient or cheaper to do so.7. A good start has been made.    In the two years since theGovernment came to power the Ministry of Defence has reduced itscivilian numbers by over 16,000 as its contribution to the overallrundown of 37,000 in the size of the Civil Service.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALPART FOURMONEYHaving discussed policy, described the roles by which our forcesenact that policy, and examined the human and material resourceswhich support those roles, we are inevitably led to the basicquestion of finance.    In this final section we consider the DefenceEstimates themselves and the management of the defence budget.We also describe the various efforts within the Ministry of Defenceaimed at achieving value for money and eliminating waste.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL8.      THE DEFENCE BUDGET801. The Government gives high priority to defence.    At thesame time it is pledged to restrain public expenditure. Abalance has to be struck - and has been struck - between theseaims, while maintaining real growth in defence budgets.802. The Defence Estimates for 1981/82 total  12,274 million,equivalent to the target of  9,753 million at 1980 Survey Prices.This allows for the reduction of  200 million announced in November1980.    The Estimates represent an increase of 8$ at constant pricesover the out-turn in 1978/79 and 5$ over 1979/80.    The relationshipbetween 1980/81 and 1981/82 will depend on the out-turn for 1980/81,which is still uncertain.803. Figure 17 breaks down the defence budget total by majorcategories of expenditure.    Figure 18 analyses defence resourcesby major programmes.804. Figure 19 compares the defence spending of most NATO countriesin 1980 in terms of total expenditure, expenditure as a proportionof gross domestic product (GDP), and per capita expenditure. Theexpenditure figures are based on average market exchange rates during1980 and reflect the fact that sterling appreciated much fasteragainst the US dollar than did other NATO currencies.    Volume II ofthis Statement contains a number of analyses comparing the DefenceEstimates for 1981-82 with those of previous years.BUDGETARY MANAGEMENT305. Budgetary management is a continual process of adjustingthe programme to the resources likely to be available.    Since muchdefence spending involves long-terra commitments, the Ministry ofDefence undertakes annual costings of &quot;the programme, lookingten years ahead.    These are examined in relation to budgetaryplanning assumptions based on Ministerial decisions about the8.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALlevel of defence budgets during the period covered by the PublicExpenditure Survey (normally three years ahead) and likelytrends thereafter as indicated by Government policy.806. Because of the extent of forward commitments on thebudget, any major shift of emphasis in equipment or manpowerplanning needs to be undertaken deliberately and carefully toavoid undue disruption.   However, budgetary planning must besufficiently flexible to adapt to modifications in the programmeto counter foreseen changes in the threat.    Furthermore, long-termplans have to be reconciled with short-term pressures arisingfrom developments in the economy.   1980/81 has been a particularlydifficult year in this respect.   The cost of defence equipment hascontinued to rise, while the recession has placed unexpectedlyheavy demands on defence funds, as industry concentrated more ondefence work.807. The cash limit for 1980/81 was originally set at  10,125 million;this was increased by  164 million in July, following redistributionof the central provision made for Civil Service pay, and by afurther amount in August.   The latter increase provided for theextra cost of the Armed Forces pay settlement ( 54 million) and anaddition of  200 million in the light of international considerationsand the priority attached to the defence programme.   It wasoffset by a reduction of  50 million on account of the cash limitover-spend in 1979/80 and by the effect of one or two minor adjust-ments, leaving  203 million net.808. Despite these cash limit increases it was still necessaryto take steps to restrain spending.    These included reducing levelsof activity to cut fuel consumption, restricting travel andpostponing some orders for equipment and supplies.    In addition,8.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALa moratorium on. new contracts Jbr equipment and supplies wasintroduced in August 1980 and lasted until November. Thiswas followed by a period of stringent discipline on new commit-ments for the rest of the financial year.   Despite these drasticmeasures to curb spending, it was necessary to take a SupplementaryEstimate of  376 million on the equipment vote, which was expectedto be offset by reductions in spending of  113 million in otherareas of the programme.809. On 20 January 1981 the Secretary of State for Defence outlinedmeasures for accommodating the programme to the revised budget for1981/82 and affirmed the aim of a continuing annual increase indefence expenditure from the revised 1981/2 baseline in the regionof 3$ in constant-price terms.   With regard to overspend, it isthe Government&apos;s normal practice to require overspending on a cashlimit in one year to be offset by a similar deduction from thatlimit in the following year.    The position for 1981/82 will be reviewedwhen the out-turn for 1980/81 is known.   Cash flow in 1981/82 and theeffects on defence expenditure of developments in the economy willbe carefully monitored, and corrective action taken as necessary.In the meantime, studies have been commissioned on our machineryfor monitoring cash flow and on our system of financial control.810. Table 2.10 of Volume II of this Statement shows that netinvisible expenditure overseas on defence is expected to amountthis year to about  960 million of which local defence expenditurein the Federal Republic of Germany (the stationing costs of theBritish Forces in Germany (BFG)) amounts to  682 million. Therecent rise in the value of the pound has produced some short-termrelief, but since last year the United Kingdom has had to meet8.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthese costs unaided.   We are continuing a drive to reduce thesecosts by administrative means without affecting military effec-tiveness, and a number of useful, though necessarily small-scalepmeasures have been taken, such as closing civilian messes andimplementing the recommendations of the recent review of secondaryeducation overseas.THE NEED FOR ECONOMY811. It is a fundamental principle of the Government&apos;s policy thatin defence no less than in other departments the criterion of va uefor money should be applied at all levels of decision. Thoughvalue for money is a simple enough principle in itself - and isparticularly pertinent when considering the approval of new projectsor proposals (as described, for instance, in paragraphs 610-611) -the disciplines and management tools needed to achieve an economicaluse of resources in long-established projects or procedures areinevitably more complex.812. The department has its own machinery to help managers deploymanpower and money as efficiently as possible.    The Inspectoratesof Establishments carry out regular staff inspection and complemetrtinjexercises - for both Service and civilian personnel - to check thatthere is a proper match between tasks and available manpower; theyalso monitor the overall control of civilian numbers.    A centralmanagement services division advises on organisation, methods andprocedures to help management make        best use of manpower.   Each ofthe Services also has its own management services division. TheDirector General of Internal Audit leads three directoratesresponsible for measuring and evaluating the effectiveness andpropriety of Departmental control systems.    The directorates workclosely with the Exchequer and Audit Department who perform arelated function in external audit.8.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL813. One area where the Government is determined to achieve thegreatest possible economy and value for money is in overheads andsupport of the Armed Forces.    Some examples of _e areas underexamination and the results achieved so far are set out below.THE SEARCH FOR SAVINGS814. The search for savings in administration and support isinextricably linked with economy in the use of civilian manpower.Measures to reduce numbers of civilian staff are described inmore detail in Chapter 7.   The Ministry has now completed six majorstudies aimed at reducing the size of the Civil Service whilemaintaining efficiency.   A number of common themes have emerged.These include the possibility, either of greater involvement ofnon-Civil Service organisations in the provision of services, or ofputting work out to contract.    Proposals have also been made for avariety of measures to tighten up management by improving accoun-tability, clarifying responsibility, simplifying the managementstructure and reducing bureaucratic controls.815. Accounts of the findings and recommendations have been placedin the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament.    Where possible,their implementation is already under way.   Further studies willbe conducted during 1981.    The six studies completed last yearare:a. Contract Cleaning and Catering. (See page .)b. Bill Paying.   Procedures for contract bill paying are beingimproved by reducing paperwork and by making checking systemsmore cost-effective.    In particular, progress has been madein extending the facility for contractors to submit theirbills on computer-produced magnetic tape, saving paperworkand speeding payment.   A total of 58 posts have already beensaved, at an annual cost of nearly  0.5 million, and there8.5CONFIDENTIAL

The Supply Management Study has lookedat the cost-effectiveness and the security and operationalimplications of extending the use of outside organisationsfor the storage, handling and distribution of certain rang&lt; sof stores.    The possibility of commercialising some aspectof the supply of petrol, oil and lubricants and accommodationstores is being examined in detail.    Organisations are beingstreamlined and some stocks reduced as a result of therecommendations of the study.    We are also looking in detaat the financial and other implications of increasing NAAFIresponsibilities in the supply of food to the Services.816. A series of short studies was undertaken by officials lastyear as part of the scrutiny programme conducted under Sir DerekRayner, the Prime Minister&apos;s special adviser on efficiency in8.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALcentral government.    The outcome of these was as follows:a. Children&apos;s Secondary Education Overseas.    The reportrecommended that secondary education should still be providedfor the children of Servicemen overseas, but proposed economiesthrough:- closing two boarding schools in Germany.- introducing weekly lodging at existing day schools.- simplifying the administrative structure.b. Inspection and Audit.    This study examined internal audit,central management services and staff inspection.    The reportconcluded that, while all these functions were needed, therewas scope for a more selective and better-coordinated approachto the functions, which should be brought together under thecontrol of a Director General of Management Audit.    The reportproposed a substantial reduction in cyclical staff inspectionand routine audit compliance checks, and recommended thatgreater reliance be placed on managers and selective checkson their performance. These measures could lead to substantialstaff savings.c. The Claims Commission.    The Commission handles most common-law claims against the Ministry at home and abroad, and claimsagainst most civil Departments arising from traffic accidents.The report recommended competitive quotations from insurancebrokers to cover motor accident and employers&apos; liabilityclaims either through conventional insurance or through aclaims handling agency.    This should establish whether acomparable but cheaper service could be provided.   A numberof simplified office procedures were also recommendedand should lead to staff economies.8.7CONFIDENTIAL

Assistea travel schemes help withemployees&apos; costs of travelling to work at establishmentswhich, because of their location, have serious difficulty inrecruiting ana retaining an effective inaustrial workforce The report concluaea that in remote areas where there is noaaequate public transport, such schemes serve a valuablepurpose ana are not aaministratively costly.   It recommendedthat the qualifying distance for financial assistance shouldbe raised from three miles to five miles.   This could saveover  1 million a year at present rates.    The report alsoproposed rationalised procedures for the administration of the121 schemes in operation.e. Defence Statistical Services.    This additional review was partof a Civil Service-wide study of Government statistical servicesThe report has recommended greater cost-consciousness and amore critical attitude on the part of managers in asking forstatistical data.    It has recommended a 15$ reduction in theamount of data being collected, reductions in the maintenanceof data - principally in the personnel and logistics field -and more use of pay and recoras computers as sources.f.

The stuay team confirmea thatscales of aomestic accommodation for the Services were inno way lavish and indeed in some instances compared unfavour-ably with outside analogues.    The report made a number ofdetailed proposals for more standardisation of design ana8.8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALgreater flexibility in planning and contract proceduresleading to quicker implementation of building projects.817. Defence Estate - Maintenance Economy Reviews.    It isGovernment policy to dispose of surplus and under-used publicsector property wherever possible.   The Ministry of Defence istherefore continuing to scrutinise the defence estate to ensurethat it retains only essential land and accommodation. Incollaboration with the Property Services Agency, the Ministryhas set in hand a fresh programme of maintenance economy reviewsof selected defence establishments.   These involve a physicalinspection of all an establishment&apos;s land and buildings by anindependent team to see whether savings can be made by using themmore efficiently.    The indications so far are that this approachshould produce good results.818. As part of the drive for increased economy and efficiencythroughout the Ministry, a system called &quot;Support: Reviews andProjects&quot; has been introduced on an experimental basis at largerestablishments, and units employing 1,000 or more staff. Underthis scheme directors or commanding officers will review overheadsannually, and will undertake one or more specific economy projects.The choice will be left &quot;to them, but the project will concentrateon one area of activity - perhaps stemming from the annualreview of overheads.   One or two officers from the unit orestablishment will carry out the project, which should take nolonger than three months.8.9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALGOOD HOUSEKEEPING1.     Work to economise on overheads goes on all the timethroughout the Ministry of Defence.    It is by no meansconfined to major reviews or even to studies conducted bythe management services organisation.   Recent work hasincluded:- The initial stages of a comprehensive review ofreprographic and printing services.   The firststudy has concentrated on the Portsmouth area,where there are over 40 establishments with re-prographic facilities under a number of differentline managers.   The second study is on othermethods of producing publications currentlyprinted by Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office,either by making the best possible use of in-house facilities or perhaps also by putting somework out to contract.    Later studies will bemounted in other areas where experience hasshown that a degree of rationalisation couldoffer benefits.- A drive by the Department&apos;s Common Servicesdivision to remove surplus telephone extensionsand lines from all headquarters buildings. 1041extension lines and 1645 instruments have beenremoved so far, at an annual saving of  55,000.- A pilot study of typing and secretarial servicesin one headquarters building.    This has recom-mended a trial of a remote typing facility usingcommunicating word processors between central8.10CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALLondon and a typing pool elsewhere.    The manuscriptwill he transmitted to the pool by facsimile and thecompleted work printed out in London.   We areconsulting staff representatives to seek theirco-operation in a trial of the system.    Over 100stand-alone word processors have already beeninstalled throughout the Department.2. A detailed review has recently been conducted into themovement of defence official mail.    The study was givenadded impetus by the decision of the Post Office to withdrawOfficial Paid stationery facilities from Government Depart-ments over the next two years.   The Ministry of Defence willcomplete the transfer to normal public methods by April 1982.3. Although headquarters buildings in London and in Bathand certain other major establishments are already linked byscheduled van services, the bulk of official mail is carriedby the Post Office.    There are some 2400 separate Service andcivilian postal points throughout the UK all of which pass mail -some 200,000 items per day - directly into the Post Office systemfor delivery elsewhere within the Ministry of Defence, as well asto outside concerns and private individuals.   At currentpostal rates this costs some  8 million per year.4. As part of the initial survey the study team visited alarge selection of units and establishments in the UnitedKingdom, and one in the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR).They examined methods and procedures and advised localmanagement on immediate improvements.    A comprehensive censuswas taken of the mail distribution pattern.    Prom this it wasclear that there was scope for moving bulk mail between8.11CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALarger centres at no extra cost by establishing a system oftrategically located central posting points throughout the UK;nd by using, where possible, the existing Service supply trans-rt (and civilian carriers in several places).&gt;.     The South West of England was chosen as the firstrial area, as it contains a representative mix of establish-ents.    Several central posting points have been set up andre now linked by a network of feeder routes with the Array&apos;sriority trunk route between Plymouth and the Central Ordnanceepot, Bicester, via Exeter, Taunton and Bath.   The Plymouth&apos;oute was brought into trial service in October 1980 and thendications of savings are very encouraging.    Trunk routes-re also being brought into use in other areas when suitablerrangements can be made.    From sampling mail brought intoIritiah Forces Post Office (BFPO) Mill Hill by this method,e estimate that the savings from Central Ordnance Depot&apos;onnington to BFPO addressees will be about  190,000 per year,&apos;bile collections on the South West trunk for BFPO alone are-&apos;stimated to save around  25,000 a year.   When the Defencetail Service is fully developed by April 1982 it should producesavings of about  2 million per year at current rates.6.     In line with the Government&apos;s policy of reducing the sizeand scope of the Civil Service, the Department has been lookingat the possibilities for contracting out a wide range ofictivities.    A decision to contract out would not be taken&apos;-inless it is demonstrated in the particular case thatcontracting out gives good value for money.    Catering, typing,Printing,  cataloguing of new equipment and parts, andproviding press-cuttings are among the areas being looked at.8.12CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL7. The review that affects most staff and is furthestadvanced is on cleaning.   A consultative document, publishedin October 1979, identified some 7,400 complemented postsfor directly employed cleaners, at 744 establishments. Itdiscussed both financial and non-financial factors (such asstandards, security and safety), noted that the Departmentalready ran some 100 centrally let cleaning contracts, andrecommended further study at establishment level, includingthe invitation of contract tenders in suitable cases. Thisfurther exercise was to start with the establishmentsemploying most cleaners, and the aim - subject to consultationwith staff interests - was to let contracts wherever it wouldsave money.8. The study began with the 78 establishments with clean-ing complements of 25 or more, a total of just under 4,000cleaners.   Cases for exemption on non-financial grounds wereexamined by Service and Procurement Executive Boards andthree establishments were excluded.    Tenders were or arebeing invited for each of the remaining establishments andthe results compared with the cost of the existing service.Staff interests are consulted at local and Departmental levelbefore each decision is taken to go to contract.    For the mostpart contract has been found to be significantly cheaper thandirectly employed labour; the exercise was therefore extendedlast autumn to a further 106 establishments, with a totalof nearly 1800 cleaning posts.9. Decisions have been taken to go to contract at 38establishments with some 1300 complemented posts. Actualstrengths have been significantly below complement as a resultof restrictions on replacing wastage.   Potential savings so farare estimated at over  2 million a year.8.13CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIALANNEX BMERCHANT FLEETS1.     There are important differences in the organisation andarecharacter of NATO and Warsaw Pact merchant fleets.Although the latter/smaller (see table below), they are entirely controlled bytheir respective governments with a minister in each country indirect charge of all aspects of their operations.     They arethus able to provide direct support to the political and militaryobjectives of their governments to an extent which is unpar-alleled in peacetime elsewhere in the world.     Though theircommercial operations are important, they can be immediately setaside to&quot; allow merchant ships to participate in naval operations,exercises or other military activity, significant part of theSoviet fleet is involved in delivering military and economic aidto countries in the Third World.     The ability to assembleshipping rapidly and to rush strategically important cargoes tofavoured recipients has been used to advantage on many occasions.Potential military requirements are taken fully into account inthe design and construction of practically all Soviet, andprobably most other Warsaw Pact, merchant ships.3.     The very freedom NATO is designed to protect prevents itfrom attempting to match this tight control of merchant fleets.There are nonetheless arrangements, in which the United Kingdomplays a leading role, to coordinate the activities of NATO merchantCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALshipping in tension and war.     The coordination would encompassthe support of military activities   such as reinforcement, aswell as the transport of essential commodities.     The UnitedKingdom also has national plans to take up a number of vessel .from the merchant fleet to support defence operations in a crisis.4.     Since 1975, the merchant fleets of the Warsaw Pact countrieshave increased in tonnage by over 50%, largely as a result of avery active and sustained . shipbuilding programme. Therange and scope of their shipping operations also underwent amarked expansion till the beginning of 1980 when the adverseeffects of Western reaction to the invasion cf Afghanistan beganto be felt.     It is significant that increases in capability andoperations are considerably greater than is the increase in theirseaborne trade;    this has risen by only some 20  - 25% in theperiod.     Since 1975 the increase in tonnage of the merchantfleets of NATO countries has matched that of the Warsaw Pactcountries, but whereas the numbers of Warsaw Pact merchant shipshas increased by about 15% in the period, the number of NATOmerchant ships has fallen by about 2%.1980 NATO AND WARSAW PACT MERCHANT FLEET STRENGTHSNumbers of ShipsTon DeadweightNATOof which UK7,4001,300239,144,00045,422,000Warsaw Pactof which USSR2,5001,70029,971,00018,708,000NOTE:   Figures cover ships 1,000 gross registered tons and over,including all ocean-going cargo-carrying units andpassenger ships (but not short-haul ferries).CONFIDENTIAL

3THE MARITIME BALANCE1. The balance of forces in the Eastern Atlantic, which hasbeen presented in previous years has a particular significancefor the United Kingdom not only in strategic terms but also becauseit is where the bulk of the British maritime forces are deployed.Such a presentation does, however, exclude most of thepowerful United States forces in the Atlantic and takes no accountat all of the roles which the forces of each side arecapable of fulfilling.2. This year therefore we present in Fig. 4- a balance that coversthe North Atlantic as a whole and attempts to show the maritimeforces of NATO and the Warsaw Pact not in simple, and potentiallymisunderstood, ship-a^ainst-ship terms, but in relation to abackground of maritime responsibilities and tasks.    It makes noattempt to show or predict the outcome of a campaign betweenthe opposing forces presented.3. The large block on the extreme left-hand side represents theminimum passage of reinforcement and resupply shipping on which NATOcountries would depend.   There is no equivalent on the otherside since the Warsaw Pact countries as a whole have the advantageof being self-sufficient in energy and in most of the strategicallyimportant raw materials*and their shipping, while itself vulnerable,is not vital to their survival.4. Immediately behind the main breakdown of combat forces arethe major maritime assets at risk.    These are units whichare not themselves capable of taking active part in a maritimebattle but nevertheless require protection.    The aircraft carriersare included here since their main capability - theiraircraft - is included in the combat forces.    Of the forces shown onthe NATO side approximately half are from the United States -these forces, including all the aircraft carriers and theiraircrafts, might not be available in the key Eastern Atlantic areaat the outbreak of war.Q^NFlklENTTAL:&apos;!

The outturn is shown for earlieryears and the estimated provision for the current andforthcoming year.Functional analysis of Defence budget and personnel numbers(Table 0.2) This table shows the provision in the 1981-82Supply Estimates for the Defence budget and the averagenumbers of Service and civilian personnel provided for in thoseEstimates, It summarises the data for 1981 82 given inTables 2.4 (Defence budget), 1.2 (Service personnel) and 5.2(civilian staff).Section 1   The Armed ForcesFormation of the Armed Forces (Table 1.1) This table showsHie number of units which comprise the &apos;teeth&apos; elements ofthe Armed Forces and excludes supporting units. The numberof personnel and the amount of equipment in each vessel,regiment, battalion and squadron vary according to the rolecurrently assigned.Functional analysis of Service personnel (Table 1.2) Hiestrengths shown in this table are the averages provided forin the annual Estimates.Section 2   Finance am! tradeHie tables in this section are particularly relevant to Chapter 8&quot;I Volume 1. The meanings of certain financial terms are givenm &quot;K glossary on page 13 below.Principal headings of the Defence budget (Table 2.1) Actualexpenditure on Service and civilian personnel, on equipmentand on works, buildings, miscellaneous stores and services isshown for earlier years. The Estimates provision is shown forjto current, and forthcoming years. The percentage of totalWcnce expenditure represented by each heading is alsoshown.Defence budget and related expenditure (Table 2.3) Theamounts in the Defence budget, consisting of the sums forwhich the Secretary of State for Defence is responsible&quot;Wrier with  those  spent  by the Department of theEnvironment on bis behalf, have to be modified to arrive althe NATO and National Accounts definitions &lt;&gt;i defenceexpenditure. The additional items include common supportingservices from other departments listed under the titles of Table2 of the Supply Estimates, Class I.Functional analysis of the Defence budget (Table 2.4) TheDefence budget Is analysed into the majoi Defence functionsusing the Estimates for each year.Industrial analysis of Defence expenditure (Table 2.7) Takingaccount of the commodity groups Involved this table gives anestimated analysis of most of the direct Defence expenditurewith UK industry. The expenditure covered broadlycorresponds to the Defence budget less the pay element,general administrative expenses and some local payments.Each Individual contracl lei is allocated to a particulaiIndustry, as defined In the Standard IndustrialClassification (1968), according to the nature ol the goods &lt;&gt;iservices to be supplied. All payments against that contract arethen recorded CO that industry irrespective of the actualindustry to which the establishment supplying the goods maybe classified In othei official statistics.Export!  and   imports  of defence equipment  (Tables 2.8and 2.9) Certain exports and imports of defence equipmentc:m be Identified through the Customs and Excise Tariff (aif.o.b. and c.i.f. prices respectively). A revision to the Tariff hasenabled some military communications and radar equipmentin be Identified and data are given I&apos;oi these Items from 1978onwards. The destination and origin &lt; i Identified exports andImports are also shown In broad regional groupings. Inaddition the Society of British Aerospace Companies compilestatistics on the sales of goods and services by its membercompanies from which it is possible to identify the exports ofother aerospace products for military purposes, most of whichcannot be separately identified in the Customs statistics. Thesefigures together with information supplied by individualelectronics and motor vehicle manufacturing companies arcshown in a supplementary table in order to give a morecomplete picture of the exports of defence equipment. Itshould be noted that the figures in Table 2.8 refer to actualdeliveries of defence equipment. As such they arc on adifferent basis to the figure given in the defence sales essay inVolume I which constitutes a forecast of expected sales inthe Estimates year 1981-82 and additionally coversinfrastructure projects outside the scope of the statistics inTable 2.8./
INTRODUCTIONDefence   balance   of   payments:   invisible transactions(Table 2.10) This table shows the identifiable incidence onthe balance of payments of our forces stationed overseas, ofour contributions to international defence organisations andof other military services. It also shows receipts, includingpayments by the US Government to the UK Governmentin respect of forces stationed in the United Kingdom. Thefigures for local defence expenditure represent the drawingsof foreign exchange necessary to support our forces overseas.They take no account of offsetting factors, including thereduction in imports to the United Kingdom and thegeneration of exports from the United Kingdom which resultfrom the stationing of forces overseas. Data are given for theoutturn in earlier years and the estimated provision for thecurrent and forthcoming years.In addition estimates are made of non-governmentaltransactions related to defence. Official payments by the USForces in the United Kingdom to UK firms and agencies otherthan central government plus private expenditure by USpersonnel are expected to amount to about  200 million in1981-82.Section 3   EquipmentThe tables in this section are particularly relevant to Chapter 6of Volume 1.Equipment procurement expenditure (Table 3.1) This tablesummarises the costs of equipment procurement. Procurementincludes the costs of material and repairs purchased butexcludes the intra-mural costs of maintenance, which cannoteasily be identified. The first part of the table separates thecosts of the equipment programme from the associated costsof managing this programme which cover pay of MODpersonnel and other administrative costs. The second part ofthe table subdivides the same total cost into research anddevelopment and production expenditure.Defence Research and Development expenditure (Tables 3.2and 3.3) Defence research and development (R &amp; D) is carriedout both in MOD R&amp;D establishments and extramurally byindustry and universities. Civil aerospace programmes andother civil research work are also undertaken and managed bythe Ministry of Defence under agency arrangements. Table 3.2gives details of the gross Defence expenditure on research anddevelopment ie total money disbursed by MOD beforeoffsetting receipts and the way in which it was spent. It differsfrom the similar data on Defence expenditure given in Table 4of Research and development: expenditure and employment,published periodically by the Central Statistical Office (CSO)in their Studies in Official Statistics series, in that it includespayments to Civil Votes and central government funds as partof gross Defence expenditure. Non-defence work carried outby MOD on repayment terms on behalf of outside customers isexcluded. Table 3.3 gives details of the net cost of DefenceR &amp; D to public funds, ie gross expenditure less receipts whichare mainly for work done on a repayment basis.Defence production expenditure (Table 3.4) The main itemsof equipment production expenditure are presented in a formsimilar to that used in I lie Appropriation Accounts and SupplyEstimates.Service supply systems: major depots (Tabic 3.5) The supplysystems of the Armed Forces cover a wide variety of articlesstored at numerous different points. The figures in the tablerelate to major stockholding depots only and cover general,electronic, technical and accommodation stores, weapons,ammunition, petrol, oil, lubricants, food and medical supplies.Repairable items at these depots are included. There arehowever, some differences between the make up of the figuresfor each Service, in particular the RAF holdings of explosivesand weapons, including guided weapons, are excluded; whilstpetrol, oil and lubricants (POL) are only included for theRoyal Navy. Stocks of POL held by the other two Services aregenerally small, their major reserves being held at commercialdepots. The same item types held in the supply systems ofmore than one Service are counted more than once. The tableexcludes the Procurement Executive and the research anddevelopment establishments.Defence energy consumption (Table 3.6) This table covers thethree Services, the Procurement Executive and the RoyalOrdnance Factories. Fuel used in MOD buildings which arepart of the Civil Estate is excluded. The different fuels areexpressed on a common basis of tonnes of oil. In the case ofelectricity the figures represent the quantity of oil required togenerate the electricity in power stations of average efficiency.Royal Dockyards (Table 3.7) Production cost figures are givenfor the 5 Dockyards combined (Devonport, Portsmouth,Chatham, Rosyth and Gibraltar) in form similar to that used inthe Appendix to the Dockyard Services Vote and in theDockyard Operating Accounts. The figures represent costs,which do not necessarily correspond to cash payments fromVotes during the year. For example &apos;direct labour&apos; includesnotional liability for civil superannuation, &apos;direct material&apos;relates to material used during the year, though some of it mayhave been bought in previous years, and &apos;overheads&apos; includeprovision for the depreciation of fixed assets, many of whichmay have been acquired in previous years, and (for 1979-80onwards) for notional interest on capital.&apos;Dockyard services&apos; covers the provision of facilities such asdocks, cranes and electricity supply. &apos;Contract services&apos;includes services by outside contractors in support of projects,and services by other Ministry departments such as theberthing of ships by the Royal Maritime Auxiliary Servicewhich can be charged directly to production.Two forms of overhead are distinguished, &apos;Productionoverhead&apos; covers indirect costs susceptible to control byoperating divisions within a Dockyard and &apos;Administration andgeneral overheads&apos; cover, inter alia, the repair and maintenanceof buildings and works, the depreciation of administrativebuildings, general Dockyard administrative costs and a share ofthe costs of the Ministry&apos;s headquarters administration.Figures are given for the numbers of vessels refitted,distinguishing major and normal refits. &apos;Major refits&apos; comprisecomprehensive repairs and modernisation to prolong the life ofHM Ships in acceptable condition and occasionally to convertto new operational roles. All refits to nuclear-poweredsubmarines are included in this category. &apos;Normal refits&apos;comprise periods of Dockyard support programmed at routineintervals, when preventive and corrective maintenance iscarried out to defect lists. Usually a limited amount ofAlterations and Additions is undertaken, but this seldomcomprises more than 10% of the work. &apos;Other shipworkcomprises routine intermediate dockings, programmed/unprogrammed  essential  defects, emergency repairs, etc.Figures are given for the number of employees which relate toall those employed in the Dockyard General Managers8
INTRODUCTIONDepartments in Devonport, Portsmouth, Chatham, Rosyth andGibraltar, and in the Dockyard Department HQ in Bath.Royal Ordnance Factories (Table 3.8) The Royal OrdnanceFactories&apos; task is to meet the munitions requirements ofthe Services and undertake approved work of a defence naturefor Commonwealth and other friendly governments.Commercial work is undertaken to assist in maintainingessential defence capacity. From 1 July 1974 the operationof the ROFs has been financed by means of a Trading Fundthough the organisation remains under the control of theSecretary of State for Defence and its employees are CivilServants.Section 4   Service PersonnelThe tables in this section are particularly relevant to Chapter 7of Volume 1.The tables show the numbers of personnel of the RegularForces and of the Reserves and Auxiliary Forces. The RegularForces consist entirely of volunteers, both male and female,who are serving on a whole-time basis. They comprise both UKService personnel and locally entered personnel. UK Servicepersonnel are normally recruited in the United Kingdom forservice world wide. Locally entered personnel are recruited inthe United Kingdom to serve in special formations with specialconditions of service. In some cases they may also be restrictedas to the areas in which they are required to serve. Troops ofthe Brigade of Gurkhas now form the bulk of locally enteredpersonnel.The Regular Forces are supported by the Reserves andAuxiliary Forces. The Reserves comprise both RegularReserves and Volunteer Reserves. The Regular Reserves consistof former members of the Regular Forces who have a liabilityfor service in the Reserve. The Volunteer Reserves andAuxiliary Forces comprise personnel in civilian occupationswho undertake to give a certain amount of their time to trainin support of the Regular Forces. The liability to call out ofthe Reserves and Auxiliary Forces varies according to theirrole.All three Services run cadet forces for young people.Additionally the Combined Cadet Force, which is maintainedin certain schools where education continues to age 17 orabove, may have specific sections for individual Services.In some tables, the figures shown for officers includecandidates for commissioned service who are required tocomplete successfully a period of training before they areappointed to commissions. Some will have entered directfrom civil life, and others will have been selected from theranks.The figures shown for females comprise the Women&apos;s Servicesand female members of the Nursing Services. Certainprofessionally qualified female officers are not commissionedin the Women&apos;s Services but in the Branch or Corps that isappropriate to their qualifications. These officers, of whomthere were 81 at 1 January 1981 serving in the medical, dental,veterinary and legal specialisations, are included in thenumbers of male officers.Strengths of UK Service personnel: Regular Forces (Table 4.1)The numbers of UK Service personnel in the Regular Forcesinclude those undergoing initial training.Strengths of trained UK Service personnel: Regular Forces(Table 4.2) The numbers shown are of UK Service personnelwho have completed the initial training necessary to fit themto carry out their assigned tasks.Strengths of the Reserves and Auxiliary Forces (Table 4.3)This table includes both full-time and part-time membersof the Ulster Defence Regiment.Strengths of locally entered Service personnel (Table 4.4) Mostof the Army personnel are Gurkha troops. There have been nopersonnel in Malta since British Forces withdrew in 1979.Strengths of cadet forces (Table 4.5) The numbers shown foreach Service include those in the appropriate Servicecomponent of the Combined Cadet Force. The numbers ofofficers, training staff and administrative staff are excluded.Deployment of UK Service personnel: United Kingdom(Table 4.6) The table shows the total numbers of UK Servicepersonnel in the United Kingdom, the numbers in England,Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland separately, and thenumbers in each of the standard regions of England. The sumof the four countries&apos; totals does not match the UnitedKingdom total because the figures are compiled from differentsources. The Northern Ireland numbers include all personnelfrom other parts of the United Kingdom and from the BritishArmy of the Rhine who are serving on emergency tours ofduty, but exclude the Ulster Defence Regiment.Deployment of UK Service personnel: overseas (Table 4.7)The table shows the numbers of UK Service personnel ineach Service who were stationed in each of the principalgeographical areas overseas. This table is also relevant toChapter 4 of Volume 1.Recruitment of UK Service personnel (Table 4.8) This tableshow the numbers of UK Service personnel who have joinedthe Regular Forces from civil life. As explained above, some ofthose shown to have entered as officers will not have beencommissioned without first successfully completing a periodof training.Recruitment of UK male officers (Table 4.9) This table showsthe numbers of male officers who entered the Services fromcivil life in each entry category. Pre-cadets are Army officercandidates who undertake a short period of service as soldiersbefore appearing before the Army&apos;s officer selection board.Officer cadets are entrants who have been selected to serve asofficers but who are required to complete successfully a periodof training before being appointed to commissions. In theRoyal Navy and Royal Marines the category shown as &apos;officercadets&apos; comprises midshipmen, acting sub-lieutenants andacting second lieutenants. University cadets are students atuniversities and comparable educational establishments whohave been appointed as midshipmen in the Royal Navy, asacting second lieutenants in the Royal Marines or as officers inthe Army and Royal Air Force and who, on graduation, willtake up wholetime duty with the Services.Recruitment of UK servicemen (Table 4.10) This table showsthe numbers of servicemen recruited in each of the maincategories.Outflow of UK Service personnel: from each Service(Table 4.11) The numbers comprises all those UK Servicepersonnel who left the Regular Forces, whatever the reason.Some personnel have a liability for Reserve Service. In order to9
INTRODUCTIONinclude all losses to the Services, the numbers who died arealso included.Outflow   of  UK   Service  personnel:   categories  of exit(Table 4.12) The All Services totals given in Table 4.11 aresub-divided to show the cause of leaving. The category shownas &apos;officers designate&apos; comprises the &apos;pre-cadets&apos; and &apos;officercadets&apos; shown in Table 4.9. As the numbers for female officersdesignate are small, they have been included in the numbersfor female officers. The numbers shown as &apos;Premature releaseat own request&apos;, for both officers and servicemen, relate onlyto trained personnel. The Services differ from one another intheir engagement structures and in their arrangements forgranting premature release. Consequently, the categories ofexit included in &apos;Premature release at own request&apos; forservicemen are not the same for each Service but they allrepresent premature voluntary wastage from the Services.Strengths of male UK Service personnel and numbers married:age distribution (Table 4.13) This table shows the numbers ofmale UK Service personnel in each age group, and the numbersof personnel in each age group who arc married.Strengths of male UK Service personnel and numbers married:rank distribution (Table 4.14) This table shows the numbers ofmale UK Service personnel in each rank, and the numbers ineach rank who are married. It is for all Services combinedthough the ranks are quoted in Army terms.Male recruitment and the changing population (Table 4.15)This table shows the number of male recruits (officers andservicemen) who entered the Services in each of the financialyears 1974 75 to 1979 80 expressed as a percentage of thenumbers of 16 year old males in the population. For thefinancial year 1980-81 the number of recruits shown is anestimate. For later years the number shown in the annualaverage that, on current plans, the Services may be expected toseek to recruit over the whole of the period. This averagefigure will be subject to change, as plans are modified overtime.Comparison of the number of recruits with the 16 year oldmale population is used because it provides the mostappropriate method of deriving an extraction rate for thepurpose of year-by-year comparison. About 85% of servicemenrecruits fall into the 16-19 age group, and almost half of thatnumber are 16. Confining the comparison to the numbers of16 year old avoids counting the same people more than once,as they progress through the age group, and also avoidscounting the 17 19 year olds who may have applied to jointhe Services at 16 and been rejected. The method used ensuresthat potential recruits in the population are counted onceonly, at the outset of their working lives.Service pensioners (Table 4.16) This table show the number ofrecipients of Service retired pay (officers) and pensions(servicemen) and invaliding and attributable retired pay andpensions. The figures for the latest year are further analysedboth by age of recipicnl and dale of commencement ofpension.Service pay (Table 4.17) The table gives information on thelevels of Service pay relating to the dates in question. TheArmed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB) reports annuallyrecommending rates of pay for all Service ranks up to andincluding Brigadier or equivalent.The reports on top salariesby (he Review Body on Top Salaries include recommendationsfor the salaries of senior Service officers of Major General orequivalent and above. The index numbers of military salary arebased on April 1975 = 100, a date at which fully up to daterates of pay were implemented. Illustrative annual rates of payfor all ranks are also shown, these are quoted in terms of Armyranks. Within each rank servicemen are divided for thepurposes of pay into classes, bands and scales according totheir employment classification, the nature of theirspecialisation and the period of their commitment to serve.Section 5   Civilian StaffThe tables in this section are particularly relevant to Chapter 7of Volume 1.The responsibilities of the Ministry of Defence have notremained constant over the period of the tables andconsequently there have been a number of transfers of staffbetween the Ministry of Defence and other bodies andDepartments. The tables show only the staff within theMinistry of Defence as constituted at each date shown andthe figures for successive years are therefore not alwayscomparable. In the strengths tables part-time staff are countedas half. In some cases the figures shown do not add preciselyto the totals shown because of rounding.Strengths of civilian staff employed in the Ministry of Defence(Table 5.1) UK-based civilian staff are those recruited in theUnited Kingdom even though in some cases they may beserving overseas. Locally engaged staff are those recruitedoverseas. The costs of staff at the Royal Ordnance Factoriesare borne on a Trading Fund.Functional analysis of civilian staff (Table 5.2) All MODcivilian staff (UK-based and locally engaged, industrial andnon-industrial), except those at the Royal Ordnance Factories,are included in this table in terms of average annual Estimatesprovision. Royal Ordnance Factory numbers appear in thefootnotes.Organisational strengths of UK-based civilian staff (Table 5.3)Both industrial and non-industrial staff are included in thistable which gives the actual numbers in each of theorganisations making up the Ministry of Defence.Strengths of civilian staff: United Kingdom (Table 5.4) Thetable shows the total numbers of MOD civilian staff in theUnited Kingdom, the numbers in England, Wales, Scotland andNorthern Ireland, and the numbers in each of the standardregions of England.Strengths of civilian staff employed overseas (Table 5.5) Staffshown as employed in the Federal Republic of Germanyinclude those in support of the British Army of the Rhine(BAOR) and Royal Air Force Germany (RAFG) in contiguouscountries, e.g, Belgium.Strengths of occupational groups or classes of civiliannon-industrial staff (Table 5.6) This table covers all UK-basednon-industrial staff including those at the Royal OrdnanceFactories.Occupational recruitment and losses of UK-based civiliannon-industrial staff (Table 5.7) In this table the numbersshown for recruitment are those entering the MOD fromoutside the UK Civil Service, and for losses those leavingthe MOD and the UK Civil Service. The net gains or losses forindividual groups in this table do not explain entirely the year10
INTRODUCTIONto year changes in the corresponding group strength shown inTable 5.6 as transfers between groups, transfers from industrialgrades and transfers to and from other governmentdepartments are excluded from this table.Civilian apprentices (Tables 5.8 and 5.9) The figures showncomprise both craft and technician apprentices.Section 6   Health, Education and Accommodationof the ServicesHealth (Tables 6.1 and 6.2) The Services operate a number ofhospitals in the United Kingdom and in areas abroad wherethere is a significant British military presence. These hospitalstake as patients members of all three Services and theirdependents. In the United Kingdom hospitals take othercivilian patients under arrangements agreed with the NationalHealth Service. The hospitals abroad also admit UK-basedMOD civilians and their dependants and certain otherpersonnel (eg Hong Kong Government employed personneland Gurkhas and their dependants). Medical support is alsosupplied by uniformed medical staff at individual units andstations.Sickness of UK Service personnel: selected diagnoses of cases(Table 6.3) The number of cases of sickness and injuryaffecting Regular UK Service personnel for all Servicescombined is given in this table according to principal diagnosisor cause of injury. It should be noted that whereas the RoyalNavy and Royal Air Force content is for all cases of off-dutysickness lasting 2 days or more terminating in the year, thatfor the Army covers only those cases admitted to hospitals ormedical units. Sickness at Army unit level, at home or onleave, is not included.Medical discharges of UK Service personnel (Table 6.4) Thistable gives the numbers of Regular UK Service personnel whoare invalided out of the Services before the completion of theirengagement. It is for all Services combined. There is sometimesa delay in collating the data on invalidings and the latestfigures are liable to amendment.Deaths of UK Service personnel (Table 6.5) This table presentsinformation on the deaths of all Regular UK Service personnelon and off duty. There is sometimes a delay in the statisticalreporting of deaths, especially those occuring overseas, and thelatest figures are liable to be altered slightly. The classificationof deaths in recent years is also subject to revision as a resultof, for example, a delayed inquest verdict.Service aircraft: accidents, rates and casualties (Table 6.6) Thistable shows the number of accidents resulting in loss of orserious damage to Service aircraft, and the accident rates per10,000 flying hours. The table also includes the number ofthose killed or seriously injured in the accidents. Furtherdetails of aircraft accidents of the three Services in 1980 aregiven in Annex E of Volume 1.Service married accommodation (Table 6.7) Accommodationis provided for Service families in the United Kingdom andabroad, partly by building to approved standards and partly byrenting accommodation. The multiple hirings in British Armyof the Rhine (BAOR) and Royal Air Force Germany (RAFG)relate to accommodation built by private developers andleased by the Federal German Authorities on behalf of theBritish Forces. Small numbers of multiple hirings are heldelsewhere and are included in the &apos;Wrings&apos; figures. Servicemarried quarters arc available to Ministry of Defence civiliansserving abroad.House ownership by Service personnel (Table 6.8) The figureson house ownership by married male personnel in this tablederive from the results of the Armed Forces Accommodationand Family Education surveys. The 1978 survey coveredaccommodation only. The information for these surveys iscollected by means of questionnaires posted to a randomsample of personnel, stratified by rank, from all three Services.The size of the sample has been between 11,000 and 14,000.Service Children&apos;s Education Authority schools (Table 6.9)The Service Children&apos;s Education Authority (SCEA)administer primary and secondary schools in overseas militarycommands for the children of serving personnel. Enrolment inSCEA schools also includes children of MOD and other UKCivil Service employees serving overseas. The total number ofService children attending schools of all kinds, based on repliesto sample surveys, was estimated to be 173,800 in 1977.Social   expenditure   included   in   the   Defence budget(Table 6.10) Services are provided for members of the ArmedForces and their families, i.e, education, marriedaccommodation, medical services. UK-based civilians servingoverseas also benefit from these services. The figures shown inthis table for education cover the Service Children&apos;s EducationAuthority and also include contributions towards the cost ofeducating Service children in other schools. The costs ofmarried accommodation and medical services are net of rentspayable for quarters and repayments for civilian patients notentitled to treatment in Service hospitals respectively. The costof Service pensions which do not relate to the current Defenceeffort, is also shown. Civil superannuation, not covered by theDefence budget, is not included in this table.Land (Tables 6.12 and 6.13) All land and foreshore held bythe Ministry of Defence is included. Nearly half the totalof land owned or leased by the Ministry of Defence is used forgrazing and other agricultural purposes.Section 7   Defence Services, and the CivilianCommunityThe tables in this section are particularly relevant to Chapter 5of Volume 1.There are three kinds of Service activity in relation to civiliansviz:a. In support of the civil power, where the forces areemployed to assist in the maintenance of law and order;b. In support of other departments (eg the Home Office inconnection with fire-fighting);c. In support of the civil community (eg search and rescueoperations).Armed Forces and security in Northern Ireland (Table 7.1)Annual figures of the Regular Forces in Northern&quot; Irelandare given in terms of major units of the combat arms, e.g,battalion or regiment, the size of which may vary accordingto the primary role. These include Royal Marine commandosin the infantry role. Figures are also given of the number ofdeaths of Service personnel resulting from violenceattributable to terrorist activity in the province.Search and rescue operations at home (Table 7.2) This tablecovers incidents in which Rescue Co-ordinating Centres11
INTRODUCTION(RCCs) in the UK co-ordinated search and rescue (SAR) actionin which elements of the Armed Forces were involved. Thetable also includes urgent medical incidents in which theForces SAR facilities gave assistance (e.g, inter hospitaltransfers). In addition to SAR action co-ordinated by RCCs,all units of the Armed Forces provide assistance in appropriatecircumstances as do the civilian rescue services and individuals.Central records of such occasional ad hoc assistance are notkept and consequently the details are not reflected in thistable.Expenditure on offshore tasks included in the Defence budget(Table 7.4) The cost of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Forceunits engaged in offshore tasks on a regular basis falls on theDefence budget. Some of the costs shown are recoverable fromother government departments.Fishery protection (Table 7.5) The data in this table relates toactivities by the Royal Navy Fishery Protection Squadroncarried out on behalf of and financed by the fisherydepartments. Routine boardings of vessels to ensurecompliance with United Kingdom fishery protectionlegislation are included.Selected qualifications obtained under Service sponsorship(Table 7.6) As a result of training and assistance given bythe Services to their personnel, formal qualifications are oftenobtained. Those given in this table are illustrative of the widerange involved.University cadetships are awarded to undergraduates before orduring their degree courses. Medical cadetships are usuallyawarded only in the final years of training. Service personnelare also sponsored at universities. A number of degree coursesare run at the Service education establishments, Royal NavalEngineering College Manadon and Royal Military College ofScience Shrivenham.In Service units and ships, education officers organiseinstruction for a range of General Certificate of Education andother academic examinations. In addition, Service personnelmay attend local education authority and other externalcourses and will normally be eligible for financial assistance,but tiiese instances are not recorded centrally and are excludedfrom this table.Much of the training given to Service personnel results in theacquisition of skills valuable in later civilian life and in somecases formal qualifications are obtained of which heavy goodsvehicle (HGV) licences are one example. The table recordspasses of tests for all classes of heavy goods vehicles.Outflow of trained Service personnel: skill or trade (Table 7,7)This table shows the numbers of personnel leaving the Serviceswho possessed certain skills useful to the civil community.Only personnel in readily identifiable groups of reasonable sizehave been included. Personnel are classified according to theirprimary employment in the Services at the time of leaving, inthe case of Army officers by the function of their Arm orCorps. Each group covers the full range of skills from theprofessionally qualified to the semi-skilled.Hydrographic services (Table 7.8) The Hydrographet of theNavy is the national authority responsible for hydrographicand oceanographic surveys and nautical charting. The SurveyFlotilla is an integral part of the Royal Navy and in W81 82,11 ships will be employed for the most part in UnitedKingdom and North Atlantic waters. The Admiralty chartseries comprises some 3,400 basic charts and 600 latticedversions covering nearly the whole world. They are constantlyupdated by weekly Notices to Mariners. Although a few otheicountries also provide charts in their national series, noneprovides the comprehensive coverage of the British Admiraltyseries which meets about 60% of the world requirements.Meteorological Office (Table 7.9 and 7.10) The MeteorologicalOffice is the State meteorological service and forms part of theMinistry of Defence. The Director-General is responsible to tin-Secretary of State through the Parliamentary Under Secretaryof State for Defence for the Royal Air Force. The Officeprovides meteorological services for the Army, the Royal AirForce and the Procurement Executive, and basic informationfor use by the Royal Navy, The Office is responsible for theorganisation of meteorological observations and research inmeteorology and geophysics. Work is also undertaken forother govenmenl departments and local authorities.Some free services are provided to the general public throughweather centres in major cities and through the news media.More specialised services are provided on a repayment basis,principally for civil aviation, public utilities, agriculture,offshore oil production and industry.Except for the services provided by the Property ServicesAgency on an allied service basis, the net cost of theMeteorological Office is borne by the Defence budget. Outturndata on Meteorological Office expenditure has to be partiallyestimated since some of it is not distinguishable from oil insimilar Defence expenditure.12
GLOSSARYGlossaryAppropriation Accounts are prepared after the end of thefinancial year and record the actual payments and receipts.Appropriations-in-aid are receipts used to offset expenditure.They generally arise from the provision of repayment services,the sale of surplus goods or of equipment purchased on behalfof the Defence Sales organisation.Defence budget consists of all the expenditure for which theSecretary of State for Defence is responsible. It comprises thenet total of voted expenditure by the Ministry of Defence andby the Property Services Agency on behalf of the Ministry ofDefence.Defence Programme comprises the Defence budget (q.v.) plusnet Government lending to the Royal Ordnance Factoriesfrom the National Loans Fund.Estimates, Supply Estimates are prepared before the beginningof the financial year and gave the proposed expenditure. Theseare then voted by Parliament.Estimates prices are the prices used in the Estimates presentedto Parliament. Prior to 1979-80 these were the prices ruling inthe autumn preceding the financial year in question. From1979-80 onwards they are forecasts of the prices expected torule when the expenditure occurs. However in 1980 81 noallowance was included for civilian pay increases beyond thoseapproved for non-industrials at 1 January 1980 and forindustrials at 1 April 1980, Estimates provision for CivilService pay increases was made in Class XIII.Outturn, forecast outturn describes actual expenditure orestimates of it made on the basis of incomplete informationi.e. before the Appropriation Accounts are prepared.Outturn prices are the prices of the period when theexpenditure occurs, also described as current prices.Public Expenditure Survey is the annual review of publicexpenditure plans undertaken by the Government.Survey prices are the prices used in the Public ExpenditureSurvey. For purchases of goods and services (including pay)they are the prices ruling in the Autumn preceding the Surveyyear i.e. the 1980 Survey prices are those of Autumn 1979.For transfer payments e.g. pensions and benefits they are theaverage price level for the current year i.e. the 1980 Surveyprices are those of 1980 81.General notes on the tablesSymbols- nil or less than half the final unit shown.. not available* not applicableSourcesExcept where otherwise stated all information is from recordsmaintained by the Ministry of Defence for departmentalpurposes.RoundingIn many of the tables the figures are individually rounded andthus may not sum precisely to the totals shown.-.3
