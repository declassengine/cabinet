CONFIDENTIAL JDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNiC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(81) 3COPY NO9 January 1981CABINETINFLATION-PROOFED PENSIONSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Lord President of the Council1. Attached is a confidential copy of the Report of the Scott Inquiry intothe value of pensions.    It should be published as soon as convenient, whichmight be around the end of January.    The appropriate form would be aCommand Paper.    For reasons given below, we think the Government shouldnot offer definitive comment at the time of publication, but should give anindication of its general reactions and intentions.MAIN CONCLUSIONS OF THE REPORT2. The Report recognises the disparity in pensions treatment between thepublic sector and the private sector, but it does not condemn the inflation-proofing of public sector pensions.    On the contrary,   it asserts that theprotection of retirement living standards is &quot;a highly desirable socialobjective&quot;, although an expensive one, needing to be paid for, and perhapseven then temporarily unsustainable in occasional circumstances of extremeinflation or other economic difficulty.3. The Report notes that present disparities would be much eased ifinflation were overcome, and that the growth of the new State earnings-related pension will increasingly in the remainder of this century have thesame effect up to the level of average earnings.    Meanwhile, however, theReport makes a number of suggestions for further action or study, but nofirm recommendations.    In particular it points to:-a. Strengthening of private sector occupational pension schemes:it is clearly implied that regular contributions of both employee andemployer to private schemes need to be increased, and it is notedthat &quot;employee contributions&apos; by civil servants, although not leviedin that form, are currently at twice the general level of such contri-butions by private sector employees.b. Government issue of index-linked bonds:  these would providean encouraging instrument for investment by private pension fundsand by private employees who are not members of pension funds;CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthey could also help to establish meats of valuing inflation protection.(The Report refers to discussion of such bonds in the Wilson CommitteeReport and does not itself go beyond recomrrending Governmentconsideration of the idea.)c.      Reappraisal of public sector &quot;employee contributions&quot;; takingthe Civil Service as leading example (a\thuugh repeatedly insistingcj the application of the principle throughout the public sector), theReport endorses in their context tike methods of valuation used bythe Government Actuary.    It questions, however, the economicassumptions which should be used - particularly the long-term realrate of return on investment - and the extent to which they shouldreflect the element of guarantee of inflation protection. TheCommittee were unable themselves to offer a precise alternativevaluation and indeed noted that such a valuation could in any casebe expected to change from time to time.    They offered, however,a range which they regard as reasonable and which extends fromjust below the latest valuation by the Government Actuary to a higherlevel which would imply an increase in &quot;employee contributions&quot;of the order of 5 per cent of salary.    The Report refutes some of theextreme criticisms and valuations which have been suggested.There is a suggestion that, in circumstances of very high inflation, theremight need to be a cut-off point limiting the extent of inflation protection.In addition there are some minor recommendations on particular aspectsoi the arrangements for determining and showing Civil Service equivalentsof employee contributions.    The Report offers no help on the separate subjectof the value of job security.PUBLIC REACTION4. The Report is awaited with lively interest.    It will be a disappointmentto those hoping for a simple and clear-cut solution.    Those who oppose anyform of index-linking of pensions will be especially disappointed.    It willseem to many that the Report does too little to warn about the long-termcosts and consequences of any system for index-linking, given the generaldangers of allowing auto~natic, built-in indexation because of its effect onattitudes to inflation and on expectations.    On the other hand, we wouldexpect widespread support for the preposition that retirement living standardsshould be protected, and the Report&apos;s  reminder that better provision is madefor this in France and West Germany may attract interest.5. Among those with particular responsibility and involvement:-a.      Private sector pension fund operators and employers may notonly be disappointed at the Report&apos;s acceptance of inflation-proofing,but seriously troubled by the clear suggestion that presentinequalities should in part be redressed by improvements in privatesector arrangements.    On the other hand they may strongly welcome(and therefore urge on Government) the idea of Government issues ofindex-linked bonds.    Some may also find helpful the suggestions forstronger contribution levels, including employee contributions.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALb.       Public sector unions and employees may well show mixedreactions:  relief that the basic entitlement is not challenged;worry over the high end of the suggested rarge of contributions;and determination to fight for as low an increase in contributionsas possible.    They are likely to point to the fact that the Reportitself found that civil servants are already contributing twJce asmuch as most private sector employees.    This is partly becauseprivate sector employee contributions are unrealistically low, andpartly because cf the greater benefits in the public sector schemes.GOVERNMENT POSITION6. The Report does not consider explicitly whether index-linking shouldcontinue.    That question was not in the terms of reference but it is onewhich inevitably arises.    The answer may well depend on whether we candevelop the ideas in the Report sufficiently to reduce the present disparitiesand assure critics that public sector employees are making a fair contribu-tion.    We need to consider the practical steps this would involve and theirimplications.7. First, there is the question of adjustment? to &quot;employee contributions&quot;pretty well throughout the public sector.    Tnis cannot be a matter simply forGovernment to determine, for two different kinds of reasons.    Firsts itwould be both difficult and potentially embarrassing for the Government togive the whole weight of its authority to an economic assumption of a verylow, &quot;zero or even negative real rate of return on investment.    The implicitpessimism about future economic development generally would be troublesome.Secondly, the Government cannot - without legislation which would be verydifficult to enact or make effective - have unilateral power to determine thematter in respect of many public sector groups which it does not itself employ,and where it does have unilateral power as an employer it could be difficult toexercise that power in a discriminatory way.8. In practice, the Report points to using the kind of actuarial processwhich has been used in some important cases hitherto, although taking intoaccount some fresh considerations and with scope for the Government toexercise some influence.    The results would presumably fall somewherewithin the kind of range indicated by the Report itself, and the Governmentwould have to accept and support the outcome.9. There would be a problem if the results did little more than point toa continuation of present levels of &quot;employee contributions&quot;.    Clitics wouldcertainly then regard the entire process as a whitewash.    The approach inthe Report does, however, imply that a fresh view on the lines indicatedwould be likely in present economic circumstances to give rise to some highervaluation than has been made previously, and consequently to higher&quot;employee contributions&quot;.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL10. Implementation would take some time, because of the vaviety andcomplexity among different public sector employees in starting-points,methods of determining pay, etc.    It would need careful preparation andcalculation in advance.    It would be important that we should seek to makeadjustments as soon as practicably possible.    Frum the point of view ofpublic response, there would be advantage in getting the process moving withinthe present pay round.    It is however difficult to see this as practicable(particularly with the framework of Civil Service arrangements confusedthis year by the suspension of pay research).    But some evidence in theReport might be used to support arguments for modest pay settlements thisyear.    We should certainly aim to bring xn all groups at the point of theirsettlements in the 1981-82 pay round.11. We cannot at present assess the overall financial impact, but we seeno reason why it should be harmful and it would be more likely to be helpful.An adjustment of 1 per cent over public sector employees as a whole wouldinvolve an abatement of pay or extra income from contributions in the orderof  500 million per year.    Seme would have to be funded.    There would beother, though smaller, offsets if - as might well happen - the asstimptionsbehind the adjustment also necessitated a strengthening of existing publicsector pension funds.    The amounts prospectively payable as pensions would,of course, not be affected by these changes.    There could also be some riskof an indirect effect on the State pension scheme, via the terms ofcontracting-out which may be influenced by economic assumptions, but it isnot thought likely that this would be significant.12. Secondly, there is the question of index-linked bonds.    This is anidea we have been examining, but have not so far accepted, in the context ofGovernment financing generally.    To embark on it on a large scale - andthe scale implicit in the recommendations cf the Report could be very largeindeed - would involve changes in the patterns of financial flows and marketsin our economy with advantages and disadvantages, now and in the future,which are difficult to evaluate.    This is not a matter which can be settledsimply as a supplementary move on pensions, important though it may be inthat context.    If we were to adopt the idea, there would be much to work outon methods and conditions, and some consultation with the pensions fundindustry and others could be desirable.    Our present view is that we neednot ruleout adoption of the idea in some form, but we should say that it needsmore study before we give it any warmer reception.    It may be of interestto see how much considered support of the idea the Report provokes, andfrom what quarters.13. Finally, there is the key question of public political reaction and whatthe Government can do about it.    We cannot expect any solution to reconcileor persuade the extreme schools of thought on this contentious subject.Our best hope is to lower the temperature of the debate and persuade asufficient body of responsible opinion that the direction we choose is atolerable one.    The Report offers some help in improving public understanding,which is badly needed,    Both Government and Parliament may be able tofurther this.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALRECOMMENDED LINE14. We think it would be a mistake to reject the Report outright and go fora withdrawal of the various guarantees and near-gcarantees of inflation-proofing of public sector pensions (net just for ci&apos;-il servants, but for otherssuch as the Armed Forces, the miners, the nurses).    The Report givesground for introducing some form of cut-off, elthough a rather high one, ifwe wish,.    This could be presentationally helpful but does not solve vhe mainproblems.    If the principle of inflation-proofing is to be retained the Reportprobably offers as strong a case for persuading public opinion in its favouras can be made.    But acceptance of that case will surely be conditional asa minimum on cur determination and ability to achieve and demonstratesignificant changes in &quot;employee contributions&quot; throughout the public sector.15. In outline we propose that our initial comments on the Report wouldtake the following form:i.      Welcome the careful and measured analysis and judgmentin the Report.ii.       Acknowledge the theoretical desirability of protection ofretirement living standards for all, undeilining the cost,uncertainty and difficulty.iii.       Recognise the sense of injustice over the disparities oftreatment between public and private sectors.iv.      P.eassert determination to get inflation down and keep itdown, stressing this as the most important contribution Governmentcan make.v.       Indicate positive interest in the approach recommended, butwithout complete commitment, noting that much would depend onpracticability, on reaction of private pensions industry and ongeneral public reaction;vi.       Invite public comment; possibly suggest study by a Committeeof Parliament (? Treasury and Civil Service Committee).vii.      Indicate that, in relation to public sector arrangements ifinflation-proofing continues, the Government would judge thatpresent circumstances justified some increases in &quot;employeecontributions&quot;.Meanwhile, it would be appropriate to set in hand urgently studies withinGovernment of the handling of increases &quot;contributions&quot;  and the idea ofindex-linked bonds.5CONFIDENTIAL

We invite our colleagues to agree:a. that authority be given for the Report to be printed as aCommand Paper with the aim of presentation to Parliamentaround the end of January;b. that the initial line to be taken by Government, and reflectedin a statement in Parliament at th^ time of publication, should beas set out in paragraph 15 above;c. that arrangements be made for studies within Governmentof the practical process of adjusting &quot;contributions&quot; and of theidea of index-linked bonds.GHSTreasury Chambers9 January 19816CONFIDENTIAL

(confidential)1PREFACE1. Our appointment was announced to the House of Commons by the PrimeMinister on 22 May 1980 and we held our first meeting on 4 July 1980. Werealised at the outset that the Government wished us to try to report swiftly sothat account could be taken of our findings in the current round of paynegotiations in the public sector wherever possible. We were anxious to meetthis time-table. We realised that in the time available we would be unable tomake a detailed study of all aspects of the matters upon which we were requiredto report and we concluded, therefore, that we should concentrate on the generalprinciples involved. It was not for us to try to determine the precisearrangements which should apply to any given case; this would be for the partiesto the individual negotiations.2. At an early stage, we decided that we should encourage representativeorganisations and members of the public to give their views. This necessarilymeant that we had to extend the time-scale for our work, but many of theproblems at which we were looking had been given an airing before and we wereconfident that the majority of those with an interest in these topics would beable to give us their views with only relatively short notice. We decided toconcentrate on taking evidence in the form of written submissions since thiswould allow us to deal with a large number of representations in a relativelyshort period. We have received over 200 representations, more than 30 of thesefrom bodies representing employees or employers. We decided to take oralevidence from only a few representative bodies and individuals. In the main, ourpurpose in doing this was to follow up some detailed points which had been madein written evidence which we believed it would be easier to pursue orally than inwriting. The individuals and organisations listed in Appendix 1 gave evidence.We are very grateful to all those who took the trouble to write to us or who gaveoral evidence.3. We have decided not to have printed and published the evidence which wassubmitted to us. However, some people may wish to read parts of the writtenrepresentations and we therefore propose to make many of these available forinspection at the Public Record Office at Kew.
(confidential)24. In total we held 18 meetings. The evidence submitted to us suggested anumber of possible lines of enquiry. We also followed up ideas of our own,seeking advice from specific bodies or individuals. We express our thanks toProfessor R A Brealey and Dr S D Hodges of the London Business School for thework which they did for us on the problems of valuing pension security and to themany people from whom we sought and received advice either formally orinformally.5. The contribution that has been made to our work by our Secretary, PeterFarmer, has been of the highest value and he has not spared himself in themonumental task of studying all the documents and composing innumerabledigests and drafts for us to consider. No Inquiry could have been better servedby its Secretary. We gratefully acknowledge the contribution which ourconsultant, Leslie Martin FIA, has made to our work with his considerableexperience of the pensions aspects in our terms of reference. We also record ourappreciation of the work of our Assistant Secretary, Theresa Pollock, of oursupport staff, Joyce Osborn and Maria Gani, and of the Treasury typists,Committee Section and Word Processing Unit.
(confidential)3SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONSPensionsGeneral considerations6. It is a highly desirable social objective that the standard of living of thosein retirement should be protected. This is clearly recognised in countries likeFrance and West Germany where the benefits enjoyed by pensioners are superiorto those of this country and the benefits of index-linking are extended alike toboth public and private sectors. In the United Kingdom, however, the full costof protecting pensioners has yet to be recognised and fully shouldered duringworking life. We believe that there may be helpful lessons to be drawn from ourwork for private sector pensions and their financing, as well as for the publicsector.7. In this country, there is no doubt that the occupational pension schemes ofthe vast majority of public sector employees are superior to the schemes inwhich nearly all private sector employees find themselves. In particular anassurance of full inflation protection is a feature common to a very highproportion of public sector schemes which only a handful of private sectorschemes can match (and even these have strong connections with the publicsector). Some 5 million employees, virtually all of them in the public sector, aremembers of occupational pension schemes which provide inflation-proofedpensions. This represents over 40 per cent of the total number of employees inoccupational pension schemes and over 20 per cent of all employees. A furtheri million employees in public sector schemes which do not give a formalcommitment to full inflation protection have, in practice, been fully protectedagainst inflation.8. The new State earnings-related pension, the full effects of which will befelt only by people retiring after 1998, will reduce to some extent the presentdifferences between public and private sector pensions. The State will then beara much greater part of the burden of providing pensions and protecting themagainst inflation than it has in the past. This will be particularly significant forthose who,   when employed, were on average earnings or less, since the State
(confidential)-:-pension, taken with the Guaranteed Minimum Pension where appropriate, willprovide pensions of 40 per cent or more of pre-retirement earnings, and thisamount will be fully protected against inflation. However, during thetransitional period, and even after that for those with above average earningsand those who are self-employed (since the earnings-related pension does notapply to them), there could continue to be a substantial difference betweenpublic and private sector pensions.Current arrangements9. We have received much criticism of the inequities of differences betweenpublic and private sector schemes so far as inflation-proofing is concerned. Thevalue of this advantage is clearly deeply felt in the private sector when highrates of inflation are experienced. One way of dealing with this is to try toensure that those who do have better pensions pay a fair price for theiradvantage. The archetypal method is that used for the non-industrial CivilService. The present arrangements are not properly understood by many people,primarily because the assessment of the value of differences in pensions for theCivil Service is part of the wider arrangements for taking into account otherfactors relevant in determining pay. This is the comparability system whichresulted from the work of the Royal Commission on the Civil Service (thePriestley Commission) in 1955. This system has been suspended for the 1981 paynegotiating process.10. We would stress that the particular figures for adjustments to Civil Servicepay to reflect differences in pensions which we discuss in this Report werederived from their pay comparability process and it would be wrong to applythese figures to pay rates which were determined by any other means.11. The general principles underlying our findings are applicable not only to thenon-industrial Civil Service but also to all areas of the public sector where pay isdetermined by reference to comparability exercises. Moreover, in areas of thepublic sector where comparability exercises are not used, the pay negotiatorsought to draw on our findings to assess whether proper account is currently beingtaken of differences in pensions in their arrangements.12. Briefly, the Civil Service comparability exercise compares Civil Servicejobs with similar jobs in a wide range of large and medium sized organisations in(confidential)
(confidential)5both public and private sectors. In the study for the 1980 pay award, more than600 job surveys were made providing data on comparable jobs, known as theanalogues. All available information about the pay rates and other conditions ofservice of the analogues, such as the provisions of the associated occupationalpension schemes, was sought. By comparing the Civil Service rates andconditions of service with this information the estimated total remunerationpackage (pay and other benefits) of civil servants was adjusted to match theestimated total remuneration package of the average of their analogues. Theseadjustments included allowances, reflected in the gross pay of civil servants, totake account of the differences between the contributions and benefitsapplicable to their pension scheme and those of the average of the analogueschemes.13. The adjustments to take account of the differences between the CivilService pension scheme and the analogue schemes effectively mean that civilservants pay a sizeable contribution towards their pensions, but, because themain part of this contribution is made in the form of a reduction in gross pay,this is not often realised. The effective contribution by civil servants, at around8 per cent of pensionable pay, is getting on for twice the average directcontribution by employees in the analogue schemes.The private sector14. Virtually no private sector scheme guarantees to provide inflation-proofedpensions. But private sector schemes vary considerably in the degree of inflationprotection which, in practice, they do provide. We do not have comprehensiveinformation about the practice in all the private sector schemes; but theinformation gathered for the purposes of the Civil Service comparability exercisein 1980 shows that some private sector schemes have largely compensatedpensioners for the effects of inflation even in the more recent difficult economiccircumstances. Other private pension schemes used in the comparabilityexercise have done less well. On average the private sector pension schemes inthe exercise have provided 50 to 55 per cent protection against inflation over thelast five years or so. However the private sector schemes in the Civil Servicecomparability exercise are not intended to be representative of the generality ofprivate sector pension schemes, and such information as is available to ussuggests that the former have given far better protection against inflation.(confidential)
(confidential)6Choice of analogues15. A question which naturally arises in a comparability exercise is whichanalogues to use in the comparison, for the choice can significantly affect theresults. So far as pensions are concerned, there is wide variation in schemesbetween the public and private sectors and within the private sector itself.16. The principal criterion for selecting analogues for the Civil Service, as setout by the Priestley Commission, was that they should be jobs which can beconsidered comparable to the job being studied. Public sector comparabilityexercises draw analogues from both the private and public sectors.17. We believe that the inclusion of analogues drawn from the public sector caneffectively create a circular argument, in that public sector employers havelargely looked at each other&apos;s pay rates and conditions of service in setting theirown. So far as the pensions element in the exercises is concerned, the inclusionof public sector analogues results in too little weight being given to theadvantages which the inflation-proofing of pensions gives to the public sectorover the private sector. If the public sector analogues had been excluded fromthis part of the Civil Service calculations, all the other analogues being the sameas before, then the assessment of the value of the difference in pension benefitswould have been somewhat higher. Against this, the adjustment for the value ofthe difference in pension contributions would have been lower. The net effectwould have been a small increase in the effective contribution from civilservants.18. We have no reason to doubt the suitability of the analogues drawn from theprivate sector but we do believe that analogues should not be drawn from thepublic sector. It would be illogical to exclude public sector analogues from onlythe pensions part of the calculations; they would have to be excluded from thewhole of the comparability exercise. This would alter the basic pay rates fromwhich the pension adjustments are made.The assessment of the difference in pension benefits19. The assessment of the value of the difference in pension benefits for thecomparability exercise for the non-industrial Civil Service is made by theGovernment Actuary. In his 1980 Review he had to make various assumptions,the principal ones being that over the long-term:(confidential)
(confidential)7(a) the rate of inflation will average 7 per cent per annum;(b) the return on investments (which includes capital appreciation as wellas income) will on average exceed the rate of inflation by 3 per centper annum (giving a return of about 10 per cent per annum);(c) the return on investments will on average exceed increases in thegeneral level of earnings by 1 J per cent per annum (giving increasesin the general level of earnings of about 8i per cent per annum); and(d) increases in analogue pensions in payment will be at about the sameproportion of the inflation rate as in the recent past; this amounts toassuming that, over the long-term, protection will be given against62 per cent of the rate of inflation for the analogue schemes as awhole (50 to 55 per cent if only the private sector analogues areconsidered).20. Some of these assumptions are inter-related and others are entirelyspeculative. For example, the rate of return likely to be received in the futureon pension fund assets and the expected rate of inflation are both importantassumptions but they tend to move in the same direction. It is, however, thedifference between them, which we have for convenience described as the realrate of return on investments, which is critical to the valuation of an index-linked pension. Another important assumption concerns the extent to which theanalogue pension schemes will in the future be able to provide increases inpensions and how these increases will be related to the levels of inflation. In thelight of recent experience, this must be highly problematical.21. While it was of interest for various purposes to examine the sensitivity ofthe valuation results to changes in the individual assumptions, it has to be borne in mind that a change in any one assumption is unlikely to occur in practicewithout consequent changes in the others. Many of the critics of theGovernment Actuary&apos;s assumptions took little account of this.Guaranteed pensions increases22. We believe that the inflation-proofing of the vast majority of public sectorpensions confers on the employees concerned a considerable advantage over theemployees of the analogue schemes.    The advantage is greater over most
(confidential)8employees in the private sector outside the analogues: their protection againstinflation has been relatively small. The advantage over the self-employed andthose who are not members of occupational pension schemes is even moremarked.23. The Government Actuary effectively assumed that the degree of inflation-protection in the analogue schemes would remain at the recent level of about62 per cent (50 to 55 per cent if only the private sector analogues are considered)which implies that pensions under the analogue schemes (in excess of theGuaranteed Minimum Pension, where appropriate) would be expected to losesomewhat more than 20 per cent of their real value over a period of 10 years.We believe that this disadvantage might well be diminished if the GovernmentActuary&apos;s other assumptions were actually realised. He also took into accountthe effects of the State pension scheme.24. The Government Actuary&apos;s assumption of an average inflation rate of 7 percent over the next forty years or more is obviously one in regard to which thereare many and varied opinions. The problem facing private sector employees ismore the uncertainty of the inflation rate than its level. If inflation were to beheld steady at any figure, and a sufficient real rate of return on investmentswere available, private pension funds could, at an appropriate price, offer a highdegree of inflation protection. The prime disadvantage borne by private sectoremployees stems from the uncertainty of the inflation rate and this should betaken into account in the calculations.25. We asked Professor R A Brealey and Dr S D Hodges of the London BusinessSchool to examine this problem of uncertainty.26. They made a hypothetical comparison between portfolios required to comeclosest to providing, on the one hand, full inflation protection and, on the other,the 62 per cent inflation protection for the analogues used in the comparabilityexercise. They deduced that the rates of return on such portfolios could be usedin order to value the advantage of full inflation protection.27. They came forward with a &apos;Deduction&apos; substantially in excess of the 1980figure for the non-industrial Civil Service.    We believe their assumption ofValuation
(confidential)negative real rates of return to be too low in the light of our own assessment ofthe future. But we believe that Brealey and Hodges&apos; novel approach is ofconsiderable interest and merits serious consideration.28. The difficulties of arriving at agreed assumptions about the future would bereduced if long-term bonds indexed to inflation were available on the market.The possible issue of indexed bonds was fully discussed in the Report of theCommittee to Review the Functioning of Financial Institutions (the WilsonCommittee).   That Committee was evenly divided and made no recommendation.If indexed bonds were available for pension funds, the problems raised by theuncertainty of the inflation rate and of the likely real rate of return oninvestments would to some extent be reduced.   The return on indexed bondswould reflect the value which people placed on full protection against inflation.The valuation of fully indexed pensions would be appropriately carried out on thebasis of a rate of interest equal to the expected long-term real rate of return onindexed bonds.   If fears about the level of the inflation rate remained materialthe pension benefits of only partially indexed schemes might then be valued at asomewhat higher rate of return to compensate for the additional element ofuncertainty involved.    We would suggest that the Government should now lookseriously at the case for issuing indexed bonds to cover pension liabilities.29. The Government Actuary assumed a real rate of return on investments of3 per cent per annum. This figure is in line with those employed in the valuationof many private sector pension funds, but such funds are not required to providefor a guarantee of full inflation protection. Different assumptions cansignificantly affect the calculations. If inflation were expected to fall to verylow levels and to be accompanied by a satisfactory real return on investments,the &apos;Deduction1 from Civil Service pay to allow for the difference in pensionbenefits would be smaller than at present. Equally, if these assumptions werereversed, as a result of continuing serious economic circumstances, the&apos;Deduction&apos; would need to be very high indeed. In our assessment we haveimplicitly assumed that, in the last resort, there would have to be some cut-offpoint.30. We feel almost bound to postulate a positive real rate of return, but we donot believe it appropriate to assume a figure in excess of 3 per cent per annumover the long-term.  We have concluded that we should suggest a range which we(confidential)
(confidential)10regard as reasonably consistent with the nature of the public sector guaranteeand the more likely prospects for the economy, bearing in mind the hope of lowerinflation rates than those recently experienced. This range means that for thenon-industrial Civil Service the appropriate &apos;Deduction&apos; to take account of thedifference in pension benefits may be taken as lying between 3 and 8i per cent.The &apos;Deduction&apos; assessed in 1980 was 3.8 per cent. The total effective employeecontribution corresponding to this range would lie between about 7 per cent and13 i per cent of pensionable pay. The figure for 1980 was 7.9 per cent. If thepublic sector analogues were excluded from the comparison, as we believe theyshould be, there would be a small increase in these figures.31. The figures which we have quoted relate only to the assessment for thenon-industrial Civil Service and only to a &apos;Deduction&apos; calculated in the context ofa comparability exercise. Nevertheless, they are indicative of the sort of effectswhich we would expect to see if the principles which we have been discussingwere applied, wherever appropriate, elsewhere in the public sector.The Government Actuary&apos;s role32. The Expenditure Committee of the House of Commons in 1977 referred tothe &quot;awesome responsibility&quot; laid on the shoulders of the Government Actuary.The public accountability of those holding public office is an important featureof our democratic system and it is important to ensure that criticisms are dealtwith properly. The simplest way of doing this is to provide some form ofscrutiny. The Government Actuary himself suggested that the present degree ofscrutiny of comparability exercises be extended to cover the pensions aspects ofthese exercises. He also said that he would like to be able to make greater useof the professional actuarial bodies as a forum for discussion of the sort ofproblems involved. We support both these proposals and we suggest that thediscussions go wider and include both economic and commercial opinion.Job security33. We were also asked &quot;to consider how to assess the relative job securityenjoyed by employees in the private and public sectors&quot;. The evidence producedto us on this topic was largely subjective. Those within the public sector thoughtthat there was little difference between themselves and their counterparts in theprivate sector.   The opposite opinion was held by those in the private sector.(confidential)
(confidential)11Certainly recent reductions in the size of most public services have not matchedthe number of redundancies and widespread short-time working in such largeparts of the private sector as manufacturing industry and in some of thenationalised industries. For a comparability study one difficulty is gettingappropriate data to make a proper comparison and ensuring that one is comparinglike with like, which means looking at the analogues rather than the generality ofoutside employments. Even this would still leave the difficult problem ofvaluing differences in job security.34. The Standing Commission on Pay Comparability (the Clegg Commission)was asked to consider job security but was unable to come forward with anyevaluation; nor were we.The overall picture35. We were asked to examine the methods and assumptions for taking accountof the value of pensions in determining pay in the public sector. We believe thatimprovements in current arrangements can be made, but we do not accept manyof the extremely high values that have been quoted in criticism of the system.36. This Inquiry has been conducted in a highly-charged atmosphere during aperiod of high inflation. If the battle to contain inflation is successful then thepresent considerable inequalities between pensions will diminish to moremanageable proportions. In any case, it is basic to any consideration of pensionschemes that a long view, that is not only a working life but an increasingretirement span, has to be taken into account and it is incumbent on us all not tobe prejudiced by short-term considerations.37. The comparability exercise is complex and obscures the reality as to whatcivil servants contribute for their excellent pension arrangements; for examplein 1980 they &apos;paid&apos; around twice as much as their opposite numbers in the privatesector analogues.38. It would be an advantage if, in future, the pension element of thecomparison were better publicised.(confidential)
(confidential)1239. We have not been able to place a precise value on the guarantee ofinflation-proofing that is a central feature of the problem we have examined; nordo we believe that the Government Actuary has been able to do so. Moreover, itcannot be assumed that the guarantee would always be met since, in our view, inextreme circumstances, Government and Parliament would intervene. We have,however, offered a range within which, short of such extreme circumstances, avalue can be established from time to time in accordance with the most likelyprospects for the economy.40. In our work, we have been able to promote two approaches that, followingmore thorough examination, could help in making a valuation. The first was theidea developed for us by Brealey and Hodges to set a possible value on theuncertainty of inflation in the future. Second, we believe that if Government orother indexed bonds were made available these could help in valuing public sectorpensions. They would also greatly help the private sector - including the self-employed who are in the worst case of all - to provide more reliable protectionand to cost this more realistically.41. In our work, if we have been forcibly reminded that the main objective ofpublic policy must be to beat inflation, we have also been reminded of the seriousconcern that pensions over a high proportion of the private sector are not goodenough. This is so even allowing for the State scheme which comes into fulleffect in 1998.42. In the meantime, it is a fact that the private sector employee cannotacquire a pension that has a guarantee of inflation-proofing on any terms. Andthus, and especially during this present period of recession and economicstringency, the feeling of injustice so widely held in the private sector must berecognised.43. The figures we have looked at suggesting what the cost of pensions willamount to in the year 2000 - a short 20 years ahead - are dramatic in theirmagnitude. It may also come as something of a shock to see that at the upperend of our range of valuations an analogue scheme providing no more than thecurrent degree of inflation protection would today require a funding rate (total(confidential)
(confidential)13contribution by the employer and the employee) as high as 24 per cent of salary.44. In short, good pensions, like anything else, have to be earned and paid forduring working life; and the burden to be shouldered over the next twenty yearswill steadily grow.45. If as a society we fail to face these realities we shall find that the preceptexpressed in our introduction, that &quot;it is a highly desirable social objective thatthe standard of living of those in retirement should be protected&quot;, will be but anempty phrase.(confidential)

(confidential)14CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTIONPublic concern46. There has been considerable concern about the value and cost of inflation-proofed pensions in the public sector. In the 1970s inflation ran at levels forwhich no-one was prepared. Everyone has suffered from this to some extent butperhaps one group which has felt this more than others has been that of thepensioners. The pension schemes of the 1960s were not designed with theinflation of the 1970s in mind. Although some private sector pensioners have hadtheir pensions increased quite considerably, very few of these pensions have kept pace with inflation. Other private sector pensioners have had quite smallincreases or none at all and have had to rely increasingly on the State for help.The vast majority of public sector pensioners, on the other hand, have receivedincreases in pensions in line with inflation. It was in the light of this publicconcern that the Prime Minister decided to set up this Inquiry.47. This concern was well reflected in the evidence submitted to us. Thegeneral argument against current pension arrangements was expressed alongthese lines: index-linked pensions in the public sector are largely financed by thetax-payer and it is grossly unfair that the private sector should be required tohelp provide a level of benefit which it is unable to afford for its own employees;in current economic circumstances, a burden such as this can only heighten theproblems which British industry is facing; either index-linked pensions should beabolished or public sector employees should contribute in full towards theadditional benefits which they receive; current methods of assessing the value ofthese additional benefits bear little relation to reality and take no account of thefact that full inflation protection is guaranteed rather than discretionary; theseanomalies are highlighted by the inflation-proofing of the full amount of &apos;top&apos;people&apos;s pensions when some private sector pensioners on more modest pensionsare getting no protection against inflation at all. About half of the writtenevidence which we received took this line.48. The other half supported the current arrangements, with arguments whichwere along these lines: pension schemes should provide for benefits to beprotected against inflation; some private sector pensioners are getting asignificant degree of protection against inflation and, although others are not
(confidential)15doing so well, the solution is to improve pensions in the private sector ratherthan to make public sector pensions worse; pensions should not be looked at inisolation; private sector employees often get valuable fringe benefits and areless subject to Government interference in their pay and other conditions ofservice; the value of public sector pensions is fully taken into account in publicsector pay negotiations and in a number of cases the values used have been theresult of detailed actuarial calculations which were objective and at least asreliable as those which anyone else would make; public sector employers have anobligation to existing pensioners and contributors to continue to provide theinflation-proofed pensions which they were promised.Approach49. We were not asked to decide what action should be taken concerninginflation-proofed pensions in the public sector. It is to be left to the Governmentand other public sector authorities to decide whether and what changes inpresent arrangements would be desirable and for any such changes to beconsidered by the managements and unions and staff associations concerned.50. Our prime task was to consider methods and assumptions appropriate forassessing the value of differences in inflation protection of occupational pensionsfor use in public sector pay negotiations: in other words, methods for workingout by how much public sector employees&apos; pay should be adjusted to take accountof the pensions to which they are entitled. This is the area in our remit whichhas attracted considerable public concern and we felt that it was right, in thelimited time available to us, to concentrate on this area. Chapters 2 to 5 coverour findings on this topic.51. We were also asked to consider how to assess the value of relative jobsecurity. We have found it very difficult to say anything of substance about this.Others have tried before us and have failed. What little we have to say is inChapter 6 of this Report.(confidential)
(confidential)16CHAPTER 2: CURRENT ARRANGEMENTSCurrent pension provisions52. The pension schemes in the public sector are described briefly inAppendix 2. The principal aspect of pensions with which we are concerned is howpensions in payment are increased. Appendix 3 shows the provisions for pensionsincreases which apply to the main public sector employments. Statutoryinflation-proofing (in nearly all cases under the Pensions (Increase) Acts) isprovided for all members of pension schemes in the public services; theseinclude, among others, local government employees, civil servants, teachers,National Health Service employees, the armed forces, the police, the fireservice, and Members of Parliament. Approaching two-thirds of the employeesin the nationalised industries&apos; and public corporations&apos; pension schemes are inpension schemes the rules of which provide for inflation-proofed pensions.However, some of these schemes do provide that the full pensions increases maynot be granted if the fund cannot afford them, unless the employer agrees tomeet the extra costs, and others provide for reviews of the pensions increasearrangements. Nearly one-third of the employees in nationalised industries&apos; andpublic corporations&apos; pension schemes are in schemes which, in practice, haveprovided inflation-proofing, although the rules only make provision fordiscretionary pensions increases. Thus, the number of pension scheme membersin the public sector who are in schemes which do not undertake to provideinflation-proofed pensions is comparatively small and the number in schemeswhich have not, in practice, provided inflation-proofing is much smaller.53. On the other hand, in the private sector guaranteed full inflation protectionis virtually unobtainable because private sector employers and pension fundscannot be sure that resources will be available to pay such benefits and are notprepared to accept the risk which giving a guarantee of this sort would entail.Typically the most that is guaranteed is a fixed percentage increase, usually ofthe order of 3 to 5 per cent; beyond this the level of inflation protection is at thediscretion of the pension fund trustees or the employer.
(confidential)1754. Expenditure on retirement benefits (including lump sum payments etc) inthe public sector is illustrated by Tables 1 and 2 which show for four of the mainpublic service groups of employees the expenditure on pensions in recent yearsand, as a percentage of pay, the division of the cost between basic pensions andcumulative pensions increases. All four groups receive index-linked pensions.Total expenditure on retirement benefits as a proportion of the pay bill hasincreased over the period because of an increase in the number of pensioners andthe maturing of the schemes. The effect of high rates of inflation is reflected inthe distribution of the total cost of benefits between basic pension benefits andcumulative pensions increases, with the latter representing 35 to 40 per cent ofthe total in 1980-81 compared with around 10 to 15 per cent in 1970-71.TABLE 1: Expenditure	on retirement benefits in		four public	service groups  million					Civil	Local		Financial year	Service	Government	NHS	Teachers1970-71	92	88	42	941971-72	109	85	50	1071972-73	130	95	60	1301973-74	172	114	78	1431974-75	197	157	105	1801975-76	295	221	143	2361976-77	352	286	193	2981977-78	390	354	238	3671978-79	495	418	274	4831979-80	580	493*	379	5171980-81 (Estimated)	755	580	425	606* Estimate.55. It has been estimated that the cost of public service retirement benefitsfor 1980-81 will be  3.23 billion with  1.3 billion of this representing the currentcost of past and present pensions increases. Comparable figures for thenationalised industries and public corporations were not readily available.56. The total expenditure on pension benefits by both public and private sectoroccupational pension schemes (that is, excluding the State pension) is currentlyover    5 billion   according   to   the  Government  Actuary&apos;s  estimates.

(confidential)19represents some 4 per cent of total personal income. The Government Actuary-has estimated that total occupational pension benefits, at 1980 prices, may morethan double by the year 2000, reaching some  13 billion.57. This increase is based on the assumption that real incomes will rise byabout li per cent per annum. As the growth in pension benefits estimated by theGovernment Actuary represents an annual rate of increase of 4i per cent perannum in real terms, the implication is that the share of total incomes taken bypension benefits will rise - from about 4 per cent now to nearly 7 per cent in theyear 2000. This would require the working population to restrict the growth inits standard of living accordingly.58. These projections were made on the assumption that by the year 2000private sector schemes would protect pensions in payment against about two-thirds of the rate of increase in prices. Full protection would impose anadditional cost on the working population.Taking account of differences in pensions59. In determining pay rates by comparison with other employments, employersand employees will wish to ensure that full account is taken of any advantages ordisadvantages relating to the employment under consideration. For example, thebenefits of membership of an occupational pension scheme may add considerablyto a job&apos;s value and, when unexpectedly high rates of inflation are experienced,considerable importance will generally be attached to the provisions forincreasing pensions in payment.60. If public sector pay were determined simply on the basis of the employer&apos;sability to recruit, retain and motivate employees, then there would be very littleneed to make precise adjustments to pay scales to allow for particularadvantages and disadvantages, since market forces would ensure that the valueto be attached to these things would be allowed for in some way in determiningthe rates of pay. But, in practice, pay negotiations will often include discussionof the value of particular benefits or conditions of service.61. The State pension scheme is also relevant because the State andoccupational schemes are complementary. Pensions under the State scheme are
(confidential)20index-linked to prices and the State scheme also provides for index-linking of therelated elements in contracted-out occupational pension schemes. The fulleffects of the new State earnings-related pension will be felt only by peopleretiring after 1998. The State will then bear a much greater part of the burdenof providing pensions and protecting them against inflation than it has in thepast. This will be particularly significant for those who, when employed, were onaverage earnings or less, since the State pension, taken with the GuaranteedMinimum Pension where appropriate, will provide pensions of 40 per cent or moreof pre-retirement earnings and this amount will be fully protected againstinflation. However, during the transitional period - and even after that for thosewith above average earnings and those who are self-employed (since theearnings-related pension does not apply to them) - there could continue to be asubstantial difference between public and private sector pensions. In Appendix 4we give a general description of pension schemes in the United Kingdom and webriefly describe the schemes in France and West Germany in Appendix 5.62. Essentially there are three ways in which differences in pensions may betreated in determining pay:(a) differences in pensions may be hardly taken into account at all;(b) differences in pensions may be taken into account but only in a fairlyrough and ready way; and(c) differences in pensions may be taken into account after a verydetailed study.63. In this Report we shall be concentrating on methods for making a detailedevaluation of differences in pensions for the purpose of determining pay. Thiseffectively means that we shall be looking at methods used in the context of adetailed pay comparability exercise. Arrangements of this sort apply to arelatively small proportion of jobs in the public sector. We are not in a positionto analyse in detail the way in which differences in pensions are taken intoaccount in the remaining jobs in the public sector. However, because of the sizeof this group, those responsible for determining pay in these jobs ought to haveregard to what we say about the methods used in comparability exercises to seewhether there are any lessons to be learned concerning how differences in(confidential)
(confidential)21pensions should be taken into account.ComparabilityPrinciples64. The use of comparability exercises can be traced back to the RoyalCommission on the Civil Service (the Priestley Commission) of 1953-1955 whichrecommended that the primary principle of Civil Service pay should be &quot;faircomparison with the current remuneration of outside staffs employed on broadlycomparable work, taking account of differences in other conditions of service.&quot;65. The comparability process in the public sector usually involves surveys of,first, representative jobs within the public sector organisation being consideredand, second, a sample of jobs in other organisations. In the latter surveyindividual jobs (the &apos;analogues&apos;) are often considered in a representative sampleof organisations in the public and private sectors. Where possible, staff areidentified in each analogue doing the same kind of work at the same level ofresponsibility as staff in the public sector organisation being considered. Theaim is to obtain all the available information about the pay rates and all mattersbearing on the total remuneration package so that a proper comparison can bemade.Employments covered66. The Government Actuary and his Department are called upon to make mostof the detailed assessments of the value of differences in pension schemes. TheGovernment Actuary is a civil servant and is the Government&apos;s professionaladviser on pensions. He makes assessments for the following groups:(a)     the non-industrial Civil Service;(b) the industrial Civil Service;(c) employees whose jobs are examined by various Review Bodies (forexample the armed forces, doctors and dentists, and people with &apos;top&apos;salaries); and(d) staff belonging to a number of bodies whose pay is determined byreference to Civil Service and other public service rates.(confidential)
(confidential)2267. The Government Actuary has also calculated adjustments for staff groupswhich were considered by the Standing Commission on Pay Comparability (theClegg Commission), for example, teachers, nurses and midwives, and localauthority manual workers. That Commission is now being wound up and it seemslikely that pay for the groups which it covered will revert to negotiation withouta detailed assessment of pension differences.68. In 1979) the pay of local authority administrative, professional, technicaland clerical staffs (APT &amp; C grades) in England, Wales and Scotland was based onthe results of em &apos;in-house&apos; comparability study. The Government Actuary&apos;sDepartment was not involved.Methods used69. The method used in calculating the value of differences in pensions for thepay negotiations for the non-industrial Civil Service sets the pattern for theother groups, although the procedures for the latter may be less detailed. In thecase of the non-industrial Civil Service, differences in pension schemes areallowed for in two stages. In the first stage, the difference between analogueemployees&apos; pension contributions and those in the Civil Service is taken intoaccount, as are differences resulting from some of the analogue schemes notcontracting-out of part of the State pension scheme as the Civil Service schemehas done. Having taken account of this and other factors, &apos;interim&apos; figures areproduced for pay and the median of these is found. In the second stage, themedian is adjusted to take account of the remaining difference which relates tothe difference in pension benefits: this adjustment, expressed as a percentage ofthe median, is known as the &apos;Deduction&apos;.70. The assessment of the difference in pension contributions requires little inthe way of subjective judgements and has not proved controversial. We aresatisfied with the current arrangements and need not discuss them further. Theassessment of the difference in pension benefits, on the other hand, has arousedconsiderable controversy. Briefly, so far as the non-industrial Civil Service isconcerned, the method is this: differences in pension benefits are assessed byworking out for the Civil Service scheme and the analogue schemes thecontributions as a percentage of salary which, on the assumptions made, would,on average, have to be paid into the schemes to pay for the benefits which amember can expect to receive from them.
(confidential)2371. Particularly important in these calculations are the assumptions regarding:(a) the rate of inflation;(b) the return on investments;(c) the rate of increase in earnings; and(d) the degree of inflation protection which will be provided for pensionsin payment.The rest of the calculation is essentially an attempt to simulate an averagecareer and period of retirement. The Government Actuary makes assumptionsabout, among other things, ages of joining the pension scheme, rates ofmortality, ill-health retirement and withdrawal from service for other reasons,career salary progression, the age at retirement and the proportion of membersof schemes who are married. These assumptions are based on an analysis of theexperience of civil servants, including the experience of retired civil servantsand their dependants. Since this assessment is intended to take account of allthe differences in the benefits provided by the pension schemes being considered,the method includes an attempt to take account of differences in the provisionsfor increasing pensions once they are in payment.72. An illustration of how the system worked in 1980 might be helpful. It isbased on data given in the Government Actuary&apos;s Report on his 1980 Review forthe Civil Service. The position is shown in Table 3. For each  100 of gross pay,the average analogue pays  4.3 in occupational pension contributions andreceives occupational pension scheme benefits (and for contracted-in schemesonly, earnings-related State benefits) worth  12.6 (12.6 per cent of gross pay).Thus for each  100 of gross pay, his net pay is  95.7 and the total value of his&apos;remuneration package&apos; of pay and pension is assessed at  108.3.73. For each  100 of gross pay which the average analogue receives theaverage Civil Servant will get gross pay of  93.9. The figure is arrived at bymaking two reductions from the figure of  100:(a) the first reduction, of  2.4, reflects the difference between thecontributions paid from gross pay by the average analogue ( 4.3) andthe contribution which a male Civil Servant would pay from gross payof  100 for family benefits ( 1.5); the difference is adjusted down (by(confidential)
(confidential)24 0.4) to take account of benefits which some of the analogues receivethrough being contracted-in to the State earnings-related scheme(which Civil Servants are not); and(b) the second reduction, of  3.7, reflects the difference between thebenefits of the Civil Service scheme and those of the averageanalogue; this amount, when expressed as a percentage of the payfigure after the first reduction, is known as the &apos;Deduction&apos; and was3.8 per cent in 1980; the derivation of this figure is explained inAppendix 6.From gross pay of  93.9, the contribution for family benefits, averaged overmale and female civil servants, is  1.3.74. Thus, the average Civil Servant will effectively contribute  7.4 towards hispension for every  93.9 of gross pay he receives, the  7.4 being made up of:(a) the first reduction during the pay research process of  2.4;(b) the second reduction of  3.7; and(c) the contribution from gross pay of  1.3.75. The Government Actuary has calculated that for each  93.9 of gross paythe average civil servant will get pension benefits of  15.8 (equivalent to16.8 per cent of the gross pay of  93.9), so that the remuneration package of payand pension is  108.4. This is virtually equal to the  108.3 for the averageanalogue, the difference of  0.1 being solely due to roundings to one decimalplace during the calculations.(confidential)
(confidential)25TABLE 3:   The system for the non-industrial Civil Service in 1980 showing theposition for each  100 of gross pay of the average of the analogues	Average of the analogues  	Non-industrial Civil Service  Starting point in calculating Civil Service gross pay	-	100.0First reduction in lieu of pension contribution	-	-2.4 97.6Second reduction in lieu of pension contribution (a 3.8% &apos;Deduction&apos;)	-	-3.7GROSS PAY	100.0	93.9Occupational pension contribution from gross pay	-4.3	-1.3NET PAY	95.7	92.6Pension benefits	+12.6	+15.8TOTAL REMUNERATION PACKAGE	108.3	108.476. It is worth noting that the average analogue employee pays 4.3 per cent ofgross pay for benefits and that civil servants effectively pay an amount equal to7.9 per cent of their gross pay.77. This, incidentally, may help to dispose of two misconceptions. The first isthat civil servants pay nothing for their pensions. Certainly, apart from acontribution paid for family benefits, no contributions per se are paid but in lieuof contributions the gross pay rates of the Civil Service are reduced. Anothermisconception arises because the widely publicised &apos;Deduction&apos; is often wronglyassumed to represent either the total cost to a civil servant of his pension or thefull value of inflation-proofing a pension. In fact, it is neither: it representsonly part of the total adjustment to Civil Service pay and is intended to measurethe difference between benefits payable under the Civil Service and analogueschemes.78. The adjustments made for the industrial Civil Service are based onessentially the same methods as are used for the non-industrial Civil Service.(confidential)
(confide ntiaQ26The main variation is that, instead of separate calculations of the differences incontributions and benefits, a single calculation is made covering bothdifferences.79. For jobs covered by the Review Bodies, the types of comparison made varyfrom one reference to another, depending on the specific needs of each ReviewBody. They usually take the form of a comparison of the value of the pensionscheme to individuals who have specific careers in various employments, ratherthan a simple comparison of scheme benefits in relation to a common averagecareer. Given this difference, however, the basic principles on which thecomparisons are made are the same as for the comparisons made for non-industrial civil servants.80. For jobs which were covered by the Clegg Commission, comparisons weremade either on a job-for-job basis or by &apos;factor comparisons&apos; - a form of jobevaluation. On the whole, the pensions assessments made for the Commissionwere based on fewer analogues than for the non-industrial Civil Service and itwas recognised that the quality of the data was not generally so good. Moreover,various approximations had to be adopted in order to carry out the assessments inthe time required. In other respects, the principles were the same as those forthe non-industrial Civil Service.81. The &apos;in-house&apos; comparability study for local authority APT &amp; C gradesfollowed the general pattern of comparability exercises. In valuing thedifference between pension provisions, use was made of figures which had beencalculated by the Government Actuary for other comparability exercises. Adetailed actuarial assessment was not made.
(confidential)27CHAPTER 3: THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE ANALOGUESIntroduction82. Much of the criticism of the current comparability methods has beendirected at the choice of analogues - the jobs selected from outside employmentswhich are considered to be comparable with those in the public sectororganisation under study. One of the criticisms is that the pension schemes ofthe analogues chosen are not representative of private sector pension schemes asa whole, so we begin with a survey of private sector pension schemes.Private sector pension schemes83. The practice of providing retirement benefits for staff employees began tospread during the immediate post-war period, but the benefits were often modestand related to the average salary earned throughout an employee&apos;s service.Interest rates were low and benefits related to final salary were much moreexpensive than many employers could contemplate. As interest rates rose,however, and the higher rates were employed in pension calculations, the cost ofproviding pensions reduced rapidly and the estimates for final salary pensionsbecame more in line with what many employers had been paying for more modestbenefits. With increasing consciousness of inflation in the economy, final salarypension benefits had great attractions and the 1960s saw the widespreadintroduction of final salary pension schemes, embracing not only staff but alsoworks employees.84. The fact that the higher levels of interest rates were a consequence of thehigher rates of inflation was, of course, recognised, but the implications forpension fund financing were not taken into account by many of those concernedwith pensions. It was certainly the practice to incorporate assumptions as toincreases in the general level of salaries when ascertaining the cost of a finalsalary pension scheme but it was not the practice to make any provision for theuplift of pensions. Nor indeed would any such provision have been acceptable,since it would have increased the cost to the same level as had been rejected inthe low interest period of the 1950s.
(confidential)2885. There is no statutory requirement to provide occupational pension schemesin this country. Until recently the idea that pensions ought to be increased toallow for inflation was recognised by very few employers. Moreover, for manyyears the efforts of trade unions were concentrated on negotiating pay with littleregard to pension arrangements. In the background the Inland Revenue wasactively discouraging any hint of &apos;over-funding&apos;.86. In the 1970s, the high rates of inflation then being experienced broughthome very clearly the unsatisfactory nature of pensions which were fixed inmoney terms. The level of benefits, having been set on the assumption of highrates of interest, could not be increased without the provision of additionalfinance from the employer. Even by the end of the decade a common response tothe erosion of a pension&apos;s value was the introduction of fixed contractual rates ofincrease in pensions, usually of the order of only 3 to 5 per cent.87. The circumstances giving rise to the contrast, in a period of high inflationrates, between the experience of private and public sector pensioners, areperfectly clear. It is not possible for any private sector scheme, howevergenerously funded, to guarantee that its pensions will be inflation-proofed, sincethere are, at present, no assets available to match such a liability. But it shouldbe able to make a good attempt.88. Suppose, for example, that the funding rate of a scheme is calculated onthe assumption that only a 3 per cent rate of interest will be received. Inflationis at the rate of 15 per cent and long-term interest rates in the market are13 per cent. The &apos;real&apos; rate of interest earned is -2 per cent so the fund cannotprovide pensions increases in line with inflation, but nevertheless there is asubstantial surplus arising from the 10 per cent difference between the 3 percent assumption and the 13 per cent earned, which will permit reasonably largepensions increases to be paid without the necessity for further finance.89. If, on the other hand, it had been assumed that the interest rate would be10 per cent, a small surplus on pensions would have emerged permitting only atoken increase in pensions.90. The first example is of a scheme which is making a reasonable attempt toprovide &apos;real&apos; pensions and might be regarded as a typical analogue.   The second(confidential)
(confidential)29example is more representative of the private sector as a whole.91. The previous paragraphs provide an unduly simplistic outline of thearithmetic, but it is significant that the funding cost of the first scheme mightbe in excess of 20 per cent of salaries whereas that of the second might be halfof that. Employers faced with pension costs of between 20 and 30 per cent oftheir pay bill would recognise that they must either reduce the level of theirpension promises or pass on the cost to their customers or their employees.92. It is relevant to note that retiring employees, given the alternative of apension of fixed amount or a reduced pension which would be increased at a fixedrate each year, tend to select the higher initial amount. Employers unable tofinance increased pension costs may thus have difficulty in negotiating lowerinitial pensions funded with the aim of preserving their real value.93. The development of pensions which maintain their real value can only occurgradually in the private sector: if it were to happen at once it would add toinflationary pressures. Nevertheless, we believe there is a growing awareness ofthe need to finance &apos;real&apos; pensions, and, as greater numbers of pensioners benefitfrom this, the present &apos;two-nations&apos; attitude will die away.Choice of analogues94. With the enormous variety and range of pension benefits available in theprivate sector, the selection of jobs to be used as analogues in a comparabilityexercise can significantly affect the results. The choice of the analogues is ahighly developed process in which the nature of the pension benefits provided hasno influence: the choice is concerned with the sort of work which the employeesdo. Jobs in a wide range of organisations are selected. The process for the non-industrial Civil Service is described briefly in the Government Actuary&apos;s Reporton his 1980 Review and in greater detail in the 1980 Report of the Civil ServicePay Research Unit.95. We have received much evidence and comment to the effect that thoseanalogues which are drawn from the private sector have not provided a propercomparison and have not been representative. None of the witnesses whoexpressed this view was able to suggest a more satisfactory method for providing
(confidential)30a comparison. For example, to be able to identify comparable jobs, the firmsinvolved must operate developed systems of personnel management. Thiseffectively rules out many small companies. Only about 20 per cent of the CivilService analogues in 1980 were drawn from companies with less than 2,000employees, and even such a criterion as this would hardly serve as a definition ofa small company. However, it is a mistake to assume that the analogues shouldbe representative of the whole private sector. They should be representative ofthe jobs in the private sector which most closely resemble those in the publicsector organisation under study: that is the only comparison which is relevant.We have no reason to doubt the suitability of the private sector analoguescurrently selected.96. So far, the analogues have not been drawn exclusively from the privatesector. The Priestley Commission of 1953-55 recommended that the pay of theCivil Service be determined by comparison with other employments and that, fora proper comparison, those employments ought to include other public sectoremployments. In 1980, about 20 per cent of the 600 or so analogues were drawnfrom the public sector. In 1955, the inclusion of public sector analogues wasunexceptionable, but in present times, with the greater use of comparabilityexercises and with public sector employers largely looking at each other&apos;s payrates and conditions of service in setting their own, there is a serious risk ofcreating a circular argument.97. In his 1980 Review, the Government Actuary concluded that a &apos;Deduction&apos;of 3.8 per cent ought to be made in setting pay in the non-industrial Civil Serviceto allow for the differences between the pension benefits of the Civil Service andthe analogues. If the public sector analogues had been excluded from thecalculation, the &apos;Deduction&apos; for benefit differences would have been increased to4.6 per cent. As against this, the adjustment to allow for the difference incontributions would have been lower. The overall effect would have been a smallincrease in the effective pension contribution paid by the non-industrial CivilService. This, however, refers only to the pension calculation. It would beillogical to exclude the public sector analogues only from the pension calculation;they would have to be excluded from the whole comparability exercise. Thiswould have some effect on the calculation of the basic pay rates, although inwhich direction we have not been able to ascertain in the time available.Whatever the final outcome, we believe that the analogues used in comparabilityexercises should be drawn solely from the private sector.
(confidential)31CHAPTER 4 : VALUATIONIntroduction98. In assessing the differences in benefits between private and public sectorpension schemes it is necessary to take into account all the provisions of publicsector pension schemes and to compare these with the schemes of the analogueemployments. The leading example of the approach is that used by theGovernment Actuary in making an assessment for the non-industrial CivilService. This is set out in some detail in &quot;The 1980 Review of the Adjustmentfor Differences in Superannuation Benefits: Report by the GovernmentActuary&quot;. We have confined our attention to the arrangements for the non-industrial Civil Service because it is the archetype, but we stress that ourcomments apply in principle to the arrangements used for other public sectorgroups also.99. The methods and bases employed, supplemented by written and oralexplanations provided by the Government Actuary, have been examined in detailand compared with the practice of other members of the actuarial profession. Inaddition, we have examined another approach to valuation suggested to us asbeing useful for this particular purpose.The assumptionsGeneral100. In conducting a valuation of the expected cash flows involved in anypension scheme it is necessary to make extensive assumptions concerning variousinfluences which will take effect over the long-term future. This is especially sofor the methods employed by the Government Actuary, in particular his use ofthe &apos;normal contribution rate&apos; to determine the differences between the privateand the public sectors. The normal contribution rate is the theoreticalpercentage of salary required to be paid throughout service in respect of a newentrant at age 25 to secure all his benefits. In consequence, one of theassumptions, item (d) below, only begins to operate after forty years. Theprincipal assumptions which the Government Actuary made in his 1980 Reviewfor the non-industrial Civil Service were that over the long-term:(confidential)
(confidential)32(a) the rate of inflation will average 7 per cent per annum;(b) the return on investments (which includes capital appreciation as wellas income) will on average exceed the rate of inflation by 3 per centper annum (giving a return of about 10 per cent per annum);(c) the return on investments will on average exceed increases in thegeneral level of earnings by 1} per cent per annum (giving increasesin the general level of earnings of about 8i per cent per annum); and(d) increases in analogue pensions in payment will be at about the sameproportion of the inflation rate as in the recent past; this amounts toassuming that, over the long-term, protection will be given against62 per cent of the rate of inflation for the analogue schemes as awhole (50 to 55 per cent if only the private sector analogues areconsidered).101. Of the assumptions listed, the most controversial feature was item (b), thereal rate of return on investments, that is, the difference between the gross rateof return which might be expected to be earned on assets in the future and thecorresponding rate of inflation. This is perhaps the key assumption. Theassumption concerning the actual level of inflation is important too, as itinfluences the relative value of the analogues&apos; benefits. There is little rationalbasis for its prediction and sudden changes in inflation are likely to beaccompanied by counter movements in the degree of inflation protection given toanalogue pensions.102. The real rate of return on investments assumed by the Government Actuarywas 3 per cent per annum, and his valuation of the Civil Service scheme,expressed as a normal contribution rate, was 16.8 per cent of salary. Thesefigures were the subject of criticism from many quarters. As an indication ofthe sensitivity of the funding rate to the real rate of return assumed, it may berecorded that if, for example, the assumed real rate of return were altered from+3 per cent to -1 per cent per annum and the other assumptions were unaltered,the valuation would bring out a funding rate of 46.6 per cent of salary. Some ofthose critics whose calculations produced results of this order paid little regardto whether the assumptions underlying their calculations were reasonableassumptions; and, furthermore, of those others who did, some failed to considerthe corresponding effect on the valuation of the benefits of the analogues.
(confidential)33103. It must, therefore, be emphasised again that the purpose of thesecalculations is to evaluate the difference between the benefits of the publicsector scheme concerned and those of the analogues. An example of thenecessity for saying this arose from the evidence submitted to us by the Centrefor Policy Studies. After what appeared to be a most competent analysis of thevaluation process, the Centre employed a real return assumption of +1 per centand arrived at a funding rate for the Civil Service scheme of 27.11 per cent,which corresponds reasonably well to the rate calculated for us at the sameinterest rate by the Government Actuary&apos;s Department of 27.9 per cent. TheCentre&apos;s Report records that they did not have the data to enable them to makethe corresponding adjustment in the valuation of the benefits of the analogues.They nevertheless arrived at a &apos;Deduction&apos; of 11.7 per cent to reflect thedifference between the benefits (the Government Actuary&apos;s figure in the 1980Review was 3.8 per cent) and released to the Press a Report which&quot;demonstrates that the cost of index-linked pensions to public employeeshas been seriously under-estimated..., thereby throwing heavy andunjustified burdens onto future taxpayers and ratepayers.&quot;We did not regard this as a helpful contribution to public understanding of theproblem. If corresponding adjustments had been made to the analogue valuation,the &apos;Deduction&apos; would have increased from 3.8 per cent to about 6 per centprovided the other assumptions in the calculations remained unchanged.104. In Table 4 below we have estimated in broad terms the effect of changingone of the Government Actuary&apos;s assumptions in the 1980 Review for the non-industrial Civil Service whilst leaving all other assumptions the same. It shouldbe noted that, as all the assumptions are inter-related, it is unlikely to bereasonable to suggest that one can be changed without others changing also.The effect is shown in terms of the &apos;Deduction&apos; for the non-industrial CivilService. It should be noted that this is only part of the total effective pensioncontribution from civil servants: further details are given in paragraphs 72 to 76.(confidential)

Assumptions such as those made by the Government Actuary are generallyfamiliar in actuarial practice, but there is one feature which is not. It would bemost unusual for the actuary of a pension fund in the private sector to berequired to evaluate a benefit linked to inflation both before and afterretirement (although this is common in the nationalised industries). Forsome funds, the actuary&apos;s efforts may be directed to enabling them to paypensions increases of the same order as the rate of inflation, but a ruleguaranteeing an index-linked benefit introduces a new dimension. Some of thosewho gave evidence to us described this guarantee as invaluable or even as havinginfinite value.106. No one can suggest, with confidence, what levels of inflation or return oninvestment will be experienced in the next forty years or so, although somelevels are, no doubt, more likely than others. In deciding on figures to use inthese calculations it is necessary to derive a suitably weighted average. Very(confidential)
(confidential)35high levels of inflation may be very unlikely but they would be associated with avery high value of inflation-proofed pensions. It is impossible to say what theoutcome would be. The Government Actuary stated that in the calculationswhich he had made there is an underlying assumption that, if economiccircumstances deteriorated to the extent that extreme rates of inflation wereto continue over a long period, some action would be taken to narrow the gapbetween inflation-proofed and other pensions. Effectively the probabilitydistribution of future rates of inflation has been cut off at the upper end so thatsome form of assessment becomes possible.107. Similar restrictions are implied in other methods of valuation which havebeen suggested.108. So far we have considered methods of approach to the problem basedentirely on actuarial conventions. We are dealing, however, with the differencebetween private sector and public sector schemes. The former are all funded andconventional methods are therefore entirely appropriate. Some of the publicsector schemes, however, are financed on a pay-as-you-go basis and anyassumptions made, therefore, as to the rates of return to be earned in future onassets are entirely hypothetical. In the circumstances it is possible that asomewhat different approach might be useful to take account of the veryuncertainty of the future. In particular it is necessary to ask what value mightbe placed on the protection which most public sector pensioners at presentreceive against the uncertainty of the inflation rate.109. In normal pension fund practice, the effect of uncertainty is dealt with, inthe last resort, by alterations in pension benefits or contributions if investmentexperience proves to be markedly different from that assumed. Therefore, nospecific account is taken of the possible range of variation in the rate of returnother than in the selection of the rate itself. An approach to take account ofuncertainty was developed by Professor R A Brealey and Dr S D Hodges of theLondon Business School. Their method stems from a modern investment theorywhich has been widely discussed but is still subject to controversy. According tothis theory, if two assets have the same expected future cash flows, but differentdegrees of uncertainty surrounding these expectations, the asset with the higherrisk will carry the lower price in the present.   That is to say, it will have to
(confidential)36provide a higher expected rate of return to compensate purchasers for theadditional element of risk involved. The fundamental reason for this is that mostpeople are risk-averse, that is, they seek compensation for uncertainty. Therate of return on relatively risky securities, like ordinary shares, has tended to bewell above that on riskless securities.110. Taking this a step further, if different pension schemes offer benefitscarrying different degrees of uncertainty, for example with respect to the effectof inflation, they might be valued at different rates of interest, with relativelyhigh-risk benefits being valued at a relatively high discount rate, which wouldlead to a lower value being placed on them. The next problem is to determinewhat those rates should be.111. The study by Brealey and Hodges (which is described in more detail inAppendix 7) used the basic assumptions of the Government Actuary concerningsalaries and inflation but also made an allowance for the possible variability ofinflation. This allowance was derived from the United Kingdom&apos;s experienceover the past fifty years, but with more weight being given to that over the pastten. They then estimated what mixture of securities would be needed each yearto provide the pension benefits of the non-industrial Civil Service scheme withthe minimum degree of uncertainty, given the assumed variability of theinflation rate. The choice of investment portfolios was derived from a modelusing the way in which, in the past, the returns on different types of security -Treasury bills, long-term gilt-edged securities and ordinary shares - have tendedto react to changes in the inflation rate.112. On this basis, Brealey and Hodges concluded that the average real return onsuch portfolios would actually be negative and would be as low as -0.9 per cent.They carried out a similar study for the analogue schemes, which were assumedto provide 62 per cent indexation and for which they derived a figure of -0.3 percent for the valuation of the retirement benefits.113. Their figures led to a difference between the contribution rates of the CivilService and analogue schemes of 10.7 per cent of salary. This would haverequired a &apos;Deduction&apos; of 7.2 per cent as against the Government Actuary&apos;s 1980&apos;Deduction&apos; of 3.8 per cent.   About 1 percentage point of the gap between the(confidential)
(confidential)37Government Actuary&apos;s figure and that of the Brealey and Hodges study reflectsthe difference between the real rates of return as applied to the Civil Serviceand analogue schemes respectively; the remaining and larger part of the gapreflects the generally low level of real rates of return emerging from the study.114. The Brealey and Hodges study was intended to be illustrative rather than toprovide an answer to the problem of valuation. Its rates of return are derivedfrom past experience and do not claim to be a forecast or assumptionsconcerning the future.115. However, the approach is of considerable interest and merits seriousconsideration as part of any future comparison of public and private sectorschemes.Indexed bonds116. The difficulties of arriving at agreed assumptions about the future would bereduced if long-term bonds indexed to inflation were available on the market.Pension funds require protection against inflation of their members&apos; salariesduring working life and mainly against price inflation after retirement. Noprotection could ever be obtained against the inflation of members&apos; salaries,although the Government is prepared to cover the inflation of national averageearnings for employees who leave a job while in a scheme contracted-out of theState earnings-related scheme. Protection against price inflation is probablywhat is most commonly regarded as being provided by indexed bonds.117. If such bonds were available the difficulty of valuing the element of theinflation-proofing guarantee in public sector schemes would then become that ofmaking an assumption as to the weighted average rate of return likely to beearned on indexed bonds in the long-term future; the difficulty of dealing withthe analogues would become that of assessing the extent to which the privatesector could afford to fund schemes on the basis of such a long-term rate ofreturn. These are similar to the problems involved in the present calculations.118. The general case for and against the issue of indexed securities - by privateas well as by public sector bodies - was discussed in the Report of the Committeeto Review the Functioning of Financial Institutions (the Wilson Committee),
(confidential)38Cmnd 7937. That Committee was evenly divided and made no recommendation.The existence of an indexed bond traded on a free market would be ofconsiderable assistance to employers, who could obtain a much clearer indicationof the expected costs of various levels of inflation-proofed benefits. Theexistence of indexed bonds would also enable inflation protection to be extendedto the pension arrangements of the self-employed and those not covered byoccupational schemes. Even then, it is unlikely that private sector schemescould guarantee to pay inflation-proofed pensions, because these schemes mustalso protect themselves against unexpected surges in the salaries of theirmembers. It should be noted that the inflation-proofing of public sector pensionbenefits is tantamount to making a series of issues of such bonds restricted to aprivileged class and on terms which have not been subjected to the financialdisciplines of the market place. We would suggest that the Government shouldnow look seriously at the case for issuing indexed bonds to cover pensionliabilities.119. Before proceeding to draw conclusions, there cure other points which needto be considered.Other points120. Mention has already been made of the Government Actuary&apos;s expression ofthe value of the benefits in the form of a funding rate applicable to an entrant atage 25, described in his Review as the &apos;normal contribution rate&apos;. The use of thiscontribution rate was criticised as producing a clear under-estimate of the cost,which, in the view of some, should be based on a valuation of the future benefitsand contributions of all present employees. In a private sector pension schemewhere there is a fund of assets, an actuarial valuation can be carried out fromtime to time and the funding rate recalculated. In the case of a pay-as-you-goscheme, such as that of the Civil Service, there is no fund of assets. Ingenioussuggestions were advanced for arriving at a suitable valuation result which wouldensure that no additional burden would be placed on the taxpayer by reason ofthe age of the members or the inadequacy of any past contribution. Methods ofthis type can only secure very rough justice unless they are taken to the extremeof charging a separate rate for each age of member varying according toduration of service.(confide ntIal)
(confidential)39121. Just as it is important to go to some length to ensure equity for thetaxpayer, it is equally important to try to ensure equity for the members. Thefirst detailed calculations in connection with pensions comparability were carriedout in the mid-1960s, and were formally codified in the 1974 Civil Service PayAgreement. These, however, were the formal manifestations of a process whichappears to have operated more generally before this under the general paycomparability arrangements introduced in the Civil Service following thePriestley Report of 1955, and perhaps even before that time. We have noalternative but to assume, therefore, that a suitable differential was alreadyestablished between salaries in the private and public sectors and that everypublic sector employee has effectively incurred a deduction on account ofpension differences from the date of his entry into service. If employees are nowrequired to pay on the basis of a regularly up-dated estimate of the normalcontribution, the requirements of comparability should be satisfied.122. Many suggestions have been made to deal with the gap between public andprivate sector pensions and also to by-pass the vexed problems of valuation.They include placing a maximum on the percentage increase in pension whichshould be allowed in any one year, expressed as an absolute figure such as 20 percent, or as a multiple of the inflation assumption incorporated in the calculation,or giving increases related to the rate of return on investments in a given year.Another suggestion was that pension increases due to a rate of inflation inexcess of an agreed maximum should be directly charged, to the extent of theexcess, to current employees. This is equivalent to charging a mixture of afunded contribution rate and a pay-as-you-go emerging cost. Methods such asthese are superficially attractive but they all suffer from the fundamentalobjection that they are inequitable to many employees. This is particularly trueof the last method, to which younger employees in the public sector would beentitled to make strong objections.123. The purpose of all these suggestions is to ensure that pensioners retain nomore than their fair share of the national product. In some circumstances, as hashappened before, the standard of living of the whole community might have to bereduced. If any section of the community had its standards guaranteed,therefore, the standards of the rest would have to be correspondingly lower. Thiscould then be expected to lead to measures which would have the effect of
(confidential)40preventing incomes moving up with prices. It would be inequitable if this wereprevented from happening to pensions also.124. It is however no part of our remit to recommend changes in the pensionscheme rules of the public sector, but in our assessment of the valuation ofpension benefits we have implicitly assumed that, in the last resort, there wouldhave to be some cut-off point. Without such an assumption, a valuation ofinflation-proofed benefits is, in our view, indeterminate.Conclusion125. In considering the numerous expressions of opinion on the question ofvaluation, there are many assumptions about the future which can be regarded aswithin a range of &apos;reasonableness&apos; in the light of the professional views frommany disciplines as to how a mixed economy such as ours seems likely to developin the future. There are also assumptions which fall outside that range and wouldbe unlikely to be employed by practitioners for valuation purposes.126. If inflation were expected to fall to very low levels and to be accompaniedby a satisfactory real return on investments, the &apos;Deduction&apos; from Civil Servicepay to allow for the difference in pension benefits would be smaller than atpresent. Equally, if these assumptions were reversed, as a result of continuingserious economic circumstances, the &apos;Deduction&apos; would need to be very highindeed.127. It is difficult to put precise limits to the range of &apos;reasonable&apos; assumptionsregarding the real rate of return on investments. In the light of the importancein a free economy of the supply of capital, one is almost bound to postulate apositive real rate of return. Bearing in mind, however, the relative power ofcapital and labour, we do not believe it appropriate to assume a figure in excessof 3 per cent over the long-term. A large proportion of the critics of theGovernment Actuary&apos;s present assumptions based their views on the real ratesexperienced currently or in the last 10 years. Such experience is not necessarilyrelevant. The last decade has been a period of unusual disturbance in theoperation of our economy. We incline to the view that it would be reasonable toadopt a real rate of return of zero as the lower limit on our range.(confidential)
(confidential)41128. We have concluded that we should suggest a range which we regard asreasonably consistent with the nature of the public sector guarantee and themore likely prospects for the economy, bearing in mind the hope of lowerinflation rates than those recently experienced. At the more optimistic end ofthe range, we have assumed a real rate of return of 3 per cent per annum coupledwith an average rate of inflation rather lower than 7 per cent and with a degreeof protection against inflation for the analogue schemes somewhat higher thanthat assumed by the Government Actuary in 1980. At the other end of the range,we have assumed a real rate of return of zero accompanied by a degree ofinflation protection for the analogues somewhat lower than the GovernmentActuary assumed. On these assumptions, the appropriate &apos;Deduction&apos; for the non-industrial Civil Service to take account of the difference in pension benefits maybe taken as lying between 3 and 8$ per cent. The &apos;Deduction&apos; assessed in 1980was 3.8 per cent.129- As has already been explained in paragraphs 72 to 76, the &apos;Deduction&apos; doesnot represent the total effective employee contribution for pensions. The totaleffective employee contribution corresponding to the range mentioned abovewould lie between about 7 per cent and 13 i per cent of pensionable pay. Thefigure for 1980 was 7.9 per cent.130. Our figures are based on the same analogues as were used in the 1980Review: the public sector analogues have not been excluded. If they were, as wehave recommended, there would be a small increase in our figures but we do notknow what the effect would be on the basic pay rates.131. The assumptions at the lower end of the range would imply funding rates,that is, &apos;normal contribution rates&apos; (for employer and employee combined), of theorder of 17 per cent for the Civil Service benefits and 13 per cent for theanalogue benefits. (The figures derived by the Government Actuary in 1980 were16.8 per cent and 12.2 per cent, respectively.) The corresponding figures basedon the assumptions at the top end of the range would be about 36 per cent for theCivil Service and 24 per cent for the analogue benefits.132. The figures which we have quoted relate only to the assessment for thenon-industrial Civil Service and only to a &apos;Deduction&apos; calculated in the context of(confidential)
(confidential)42a comparability exercise. Nevertheless, they are indicative of the sort of effectswhich we would expect to see if the principles which we have been discussingwere applied, wherever appropriate, in the public sector.(confidential)
(confidential)43CHAPTER 5: THE ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT ACTUARY133. Referring to the Government Actuary&apos;s role in making pensionsassessments, the Expenditure Committee of the House of Commons in 1977 said:&quot;one man ultimately has this awesome responsibility and has hardly anychance of getting it right, which is no criticism of the Government Actuarybut is a criticism of a system which sets him an impossible task&quot;.134. The problem here is really one of public confidence. Whilst we believe thatthe Government Actuary goes about his tasks in an entirely proper way, it is onlyright, in view of the wide implications of his work, that the public should seeksafeguards to ensure that the job is being done properly. We see no reason totake the task of assessing differences in pension benefits away from the care ofthe Government Actuary; indeed the calculations require specialised knowledgewhich is not available to other actuaries. It is, however, important that thereshould be some suitable means of independent scrutiny of these calculations.135. The Government Actuary has himself said that he would welcome greateroutside scrutiny of his work. He intends to continue to publish reports on whichthe informed public, and actuaries in particular, can comment. He has also madetwo further suggestions. First, the present degree of scrutiny of thecomparability exercises could be extended to cover more aspects of the exercisesso that the data and the assumptions being made can be more easily interpretedin the light of the use to which they are ultimately to be put. Second, he has saidthat he would like to be able to make greater use of the professional actuarialbodies as a forum for discussion of the problems involved.136. Other people have suggested that some sort of independent body shoulddetermine what assumptions should be made in the calculations. We have somesympathy with this view but in practice such an arrangement might createproblems rather than resolve them. Instead, we suggest that the scrutiny ofcomparability exercises should include the pensions aspects. Further, we supportthe Government Actuary&apos;s suggestion for discussions and suggest that theseshould involve not only actuarial opinion but economic and commercial opinion aswell.
(confidential)44CHAPTER 6: JOB SECURITY137. We were also asked &quot;to consider how to assess the relative job securityenjoyed by employees in the private and public sectors&quot;. The evidence producedto us on this topic was largely subjective. Those within the public sector thoughtthat there was little difference between themselves and their counterparts in theprivate sector. The opposite opinion was held by those in the private sector.Certainly recent reductions in the size of most public services have not matchedthe number of redundancies and widespread short-time working in such largeparts of the private sector as manufacturing industry and in some of thenationalised industries. For a comparability study one difficulty is gettingappropriate data to make a proper comparison and ensuring that one is comparinglike with like, which means looking at the analogues rather than the generality ofoutside employments. Even this would still leave the difficult problem ofvaluing differences in job security.138.

(confidential)50APPENDIX 2: PUBLIC SECTOR PENSION SCHEMES1. The following account of the rules of public sector pension schemes isintended to describe the main provisions of those schemes. This note by nomeans describes all the provisions and should not be taken as an authoritativestatement of the rules of any particular public sector scheme.Public services2. Although there are variations between the various public service pensionschemes, they all conform to the same general pattern, with the exception of thearmed forces&apos; pension scheme. They are final-salary schemes, in that benefitsare usually based on pay either in the last year of service or in the best year ofthe last 3 years. Usually pensionable pay is defined as basic pay plus permanentemoluments and excludes such items as overtime. Any deduction from pay orpension to take account of national insurance benefits is minimal.3. On retirement at or after reaching age 60, the pension is one-eightieth offinal pay per year of reckonable service and there is a lump sum of three timesthe pension. For certain special classes, however, such as policemen, firemen,prison officers and nurses, the pension age may be 50 or 55. For policemen,firemen and prison officers, service in excess of 20 years counts at double itsactual length.4. On retirement on grounds of ill-health after at least 5 years service,immediate benefits are paid as for age retirement but the actual service may beenhanced in calculating the amount of the pension and the lump sum.5. If a male employee dies, either in service or after retirement on pension,leaving a widow, she receives a pension payable at half the rate of pension whichher husband was receiving or which he would have received had he retired ongrounds of ill-health immediately before his death. The widows&apos; benefit ispayable at a higher rate for the first three months of widowhood and there areadditions for dependent children. Widows&apos; pensions cease on remarriage beforeage 60. If there are dependent children but there is no widow, orphans&apos; pensionsare payable.  For all employees, a lump sum is payable on death in service which
(confidential)51is the greater of one year&apos;s pay or the lump sum that would have been payable onill-health retirement.6. In all cases of withdrawal from service a transfer value may be paid underthe public sector transfer arrangements to any scheme which will accept it. Ifno transfer value is paid, benefits depend on the length of service. If theemployee has served for at least 5 years he or she will be granted a preservedpension and lump sum coming into payment at age 60 and calculated as thoughretirement on age grounds had taken place at the date of withdrawal.Entitlement to widows&apos; benefits is also preserved. If the employee has servedless than 5 years and no transfer value has been paid then, generally speaking,the employee&apos;s contributions will be returned with interest, but this does notapply to the Civil Service scheme where instead a small gratuity is paid if theservice has been between 2 and 5 years.7. All benefits, including widows&apos; pensions, deferred pensions and lump sums,are protected against inflation under the Pensions (Increase) Acts, but except inspecial cases increases are not paid until the pensioner has reached the age of 55.8. The Civil Service schemes have special contribution arrangements whichare described in the body of this Report. Most of the other schemes arecontributory, the contribution usually being 5 or 6 per cent of pay.9. The scheme for the armed forces has many of the features described above,but also a number of special features designed to reflect the diverse ages atwhich many officers and service men retire. Benefits are not strictly inproportion to the length of service, and amounts of pension are based on the rankattained and not directly related to final pay. The scheme is non-contributory.10. All the schemes are contracted-out of the earnings-related part of theState scheme.Nationalised industries and public corporations11. In most cases the pension schemes of the nationalised industries and publiccorporations are not very different from those of the public services, but theyare rather more varied. The main differences are:(confidential)
(confidential)52(a) in some cases the definition of final salary for benefit purposes is theaverage pay for the best consecutive 3 years in the last 13, often withprovision for the amount used in the calculations to be up-rated inline with the cost of living to the date of retirement;(b) benefits are often based on actual PAYE earnings;(c) about half the schemes allow for national insurance pensions, usuallyby ignoring a specified amount of earnings in calculating bothcontributions and benefits;(d) the normal retirement age is usually 65 for men and 60 for women,although in some schemes it is 60 for both sexes and may be lower forspecial classes;(e) the lump sums on death in service are often larger than in the publicservice schemes; and(f) almost all the schemes are contributory with rates of employeecontribution ranging from 2 to 9i per cent of pensionable pay, themost usual figures being in the range 6 to 8 per cent.12. There are also differences as regards pensions increases. A high proportionof nationalised industry pension schemes provide in their rules for inflation-proofed pensions, though there may be provision for full protection to bewithdrawn in some circumstances. Most of the remainder have in practiceprovided inflation-proofing although their rules only make provision fordiscretionary pensions increases.
(confidential)53APPENDIX 3: MAIN PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYMENTS AND THEPROVISIONS FOR INCREASING THEIR PENSIONS1. The following tables show some of the main public sector employments(generally speaking those with 10,000 or more employees). They cover about6i million of the 7} million public sector jobs. So far as possible the numbersare in terms of whole-time equivalents. Some of the figures are more up-to-datethen others. It should be noted that not all employees are members of theemployers&apos; pension schemes.2. The notes column shows cases where detailed assessments of the value ofdifferences in pensions have been made in determining pay.

(confidential)58APPENDIX 4:   GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF PENSION SCHEMESIN THE UNITED KINGDOM1. In the United Kingdom, pensions are provided by two main sources:occupational pension schemes and the State.Occupational pension schemes2. The Government Actuary has estimated that in 1979 some 11.8 millionemployees were members of occupational pension schemes. This figurerepresented about one half of the total number of employees. Of the11.8 million, 5.6 million were estimated to be in the public sector (representing75 per cent of all employees in the public sector) and 6.2 million in the privatesector (representing about 40 per cent of all employees in the private sector).The number of occupational pensions in payment in 1979 was approaching4 million, about 60 per cent of these being public sector pensions. The totalexpenditure of occupational pension schemes is currently over  5 billion a year.3. Some interesting information about pension funds and pension funding,including a projection of occupational pension schemes to the end of the century,is contained in a paper submitted by the Government Actuary to the Committeeto Review the Functioning of Financial Institutions - the Wilson Committee. Itwas published as Appendix 5 to the Committee&apos;s Report (Cmnd 7937).4. On the assumptions made for that paper, the number of occupationalpensions may be approaching 5J million by the year 2000, with public sectorpensions accounting for 55 to 60 per cent of the total. The total expenditure ofoccupational pension schemes in that year may be about  13 billion, at 1980 pricelevels, with about  8 billion relating to the public sector and about  5 billionrelating to the private sector.5. An occupational pension scheme normally forms part of an employee&apos;sconditions of service, and, subject to certain rights of limitation, an employerundertakes that, through his occupational pension scheme, his employees or theirdependants will receive certain payments. In part the employee may havecontributed to these payments himself, but usually the major part of the cost will(confidential)
(confidential)59have been financed by contributions from the employer. Effectively the value ofthe difference between the benefits which are received and the contributionswhich the employee makes represents an addition to the employee&apos;sremuneration. It is not surprising, therefore, that the scales of benefits to beprovided under an occupational pension scheme and the division of the cost ofproviding these benefits between the employer and the employee are increasinglybecoming a matter for negotiation.6. Some of the main ways in which the benefits from occupational pensionschemes can vary are set out below:(a) the level of the basic pension may depend on a &apos;final&apos; salary based onpay in the last year or years of work, or in selected years of work, ormay, though this is rare, relate directly to the contributions made andthe interest earned on them;(b) where the level of pension depends on &apos;final&apos; salary and the number ofyears worked then there may be differences in the fraction which isused in calculating the pension;(c) the age at which a retirement pension is payable may vary;(d) some schemes may offer a pension and a lump sum payment; othersmay offer only one of these or allow part of a pension to be given upin return for a lump sum;(e) there may be pensions for widows and other dependants, and lumpsums payable if an employee dies while in service;(f) the benefits payable if an employee withdraws from the pensionscheme before the normal retirement age is reached may vary; and(g) different provisions may be made for increasing pensions in payment.7. As well as differences due to different levels of benefits, occupationalpension schemes differ because of the levels of contribution required fromemployees and the way in which these contributions are paid. Sometimes theemployee&apos;s contribution is &apos;invisible&apos; in that the contribution is not made fromgross pay, but instead the gross level of pay may be lower them it wouldotherwise be in lieu of a direct contribution. Sometimes there is a mixture ofthese two methods of contributing, for example where an additional benefit canbe bought.(confidential)
(confidential)608. The rates of contributions in the private sector vary considerably but theaverage is probably between 4 and 6 per cent of gross salary. There is also awide variation in the contributions made by private sector employers but theaverage is probably between 7 and 12 per cent of an employee&apos;s salary.9. Another factor which causes differences in pension schemes is the methodby which they are financed. Most occupational pensions schemes are &apos;funded&apos;. Afund is built up from the contributions paid in together with income earned onthe scheme&apos;s investments and this fund is available to meet expenditure onpensions and other benefits. But some schemes operate on a pay-as-you-goprinciple: no attempt is made to accumulate reserves and pensions areessentially paid out of current income. This method of financing is practicallyunknown in the private sector, where, in the interests of security, funding inadvance is more desirable, but it is adopted by a number of schemes in the publicsector, where no such problems of security arise. In the public sector there issometimes a further variation: the &apos;notional fund&apos;. Here a record is kept of whatthe size of the fund would be if it really existed, but no actual fund is maintainedand contributions and benefits are instead paid into or drawn out of currentrevenue.The State scheme10. All employees must contribute to and can expect to benefit from the Statepension scheme. Employers also contribute. Amendments to the scheme cameinto effect in 1978 and it is convenient to refer to the arrangements before andafter the changes as the old and new arrangements respectively.11. The State pension can be made up of three main elements, and which apensioner qualifies for depends on whether he contributed under the old or newarrangements. There are other additions, such as invalidity and age addition, butthese need not concern us here. The three main elements are:(a) a basic pension, currently set at  27.15 per week for a single person;payment of this in full depends on a pensioner&apos;s record ofcontributions over his working life under both old and newarrangements;(confidential)
(confidential)61(b) an additional earnings-related pension under the new arrangementswhich is only paid to pensioners who have paid Class I NationalInsurance contributions as employees since April 1978 on earningsbetween a lower earnings limit (which the Government proposesshould be  27 per week from April 1981) and an upper earnings limit(which the Government proposes should be  200 per week); to get themaximum benefit, contributions must have been paid for at least20 years after April 1978; the self-employed cannot qualify for thiselement; and(c) a graduated pension based on contributions paid between 1961 and1975 under the old arrangements.12. If an employer operates a pension scheme which can meet certainrequirements then he can apply to contract his employees out of the Statescheme&apos;s additional earnings-related pension described at (b) above. Both theemployer and his employees then pay lower contributions to the State scheme butthe contracted-out occupational pension scheme must provide the employeeswith at least a guaranteed minimum pension (GMP), which on retirement broadlymatches the additional pension which they would have earned from the Statescheme. The GMP is fixed at the level calculated on retirement however, and, sothat employees get the same treatment as they would have received if they hadnot been contracted-out, the State pays the difference between the indexedadditional pension which would have been payable and the fixed GMP; thus thecost of inflation-proofing the GMP is borne by the State scheme. Theresponsibility for protecting the remainder of the occupational pension remainswith the occupational pension scheme.13. The following table gives an indication of the total State pension and GMPpayable to a pensioner, expressed as a percentage of pre-retirement earnings. Itshows, for a range of pre-retirement earnings, the position of a person retiring in1978 and a person retiring in 1998. It is assumed that the basic pension and thelower and upper earnings limits will continue to be about the same proportion ofaverage full-time male earnings as at present. Any graduated pension payable(which cannot exceed about  3 per week at present levels) is excluded from thetable. All the amounts are inflation-proofed by the State.(confidential)
(confidential)62TABLE 7:   Effects of the new State scheme arrangementsPre-retirement earningsas proportion of averagefull-time male earningsState pension and GMP aspercentage of pre-retirementearnings for retirement in:19781998i 40 551 20 401J 13 352 10 263 7 174 5 1314. If it is assumed that the aim of occupational pension schemes is to make upthe total inflation-proofed pension income to two-thirds of pre-retirementearnings, then it can be seen that the State will bear a much greater part of theburden for people retiring in 1998 or later than it did in 1978. This will beparticularly significant for those who, when employed, were on average earningsor less, since the State pension and the GMP will provide over 60 per cent oftotal pension income. This will be fully protected against inflation by the State,leaving only a relatively small amount to be protected by occupational pensionschemes. The State will also have taken on increased responsibility for thepensions of people on higher earnings but these pensioners will still have to lookto their occupational pension schemes for protection of a relatively large amountof their total pension income.(confidential)
(confidential)63APPENDIX 5:   PENSION SCHEMES IN FRANCE AND WEST GERMANY1. The following note gives no more than an outline of the pension schemes inFrance and West Germany.2. In France, there is a State scheme intended to provide a pension of about50 per cent of average earnings over the last 10 years (revalued up to retirementage as in the British earnings-related scheme) calculated on earnings up to aceiling which is revised annually (currently Frs. 60,120). Further contributionsare paid to industry-wide pension schemes set up under the supervision of twoorganisations, ARRCO and AGIRC, run by representatives of the employers andunions. ARRCO covers manual workers and lower paid salaried employees, whileAGIRC covers managers and specialists.3. Pensions are calculated on the basis of points. These reflect thepercentage contribution, and the ratio of the earnings on which contributions arepaid to a reference salary based on average earnings levels at the timecontributions are paid. As the reference salary increases the points are revalued.Each year a value is put on a pension point and a pensioner is paid an amountequal to the value of his total points. The intention is that, as contributions willrise as average earnings increase, the value of a point will keep pace withinflation both before and after retirement.4. The overall effect is that pensions for long service employees wouldnormally range from about 65 to 70 per cent of their revalued average earningsfor lower paid employees down to about 55 to 60 per cent of their revaluedaverage earnings for managers and specialists.5. The stability of the system depends on the ratio of the number ofpensioners to the number of contributors. The State scheme&apos;s position is largelydetermined by the past demographic history of France and appears fairly secure,at least till the end of the century. The ARRCO and AGIRC schemes have,however, expanded fairly rapidly and hence the ratio of pensioners tocontributors until now has been much smaller than it would be in a stable state.France
(confidential)64This has led to the schemes providing benefits more generous than could beafforded on a long-term basis. It has already been necessary to increasecontribution percentages without any increase in the real value of the benefitsprovided, and it seems likely that further increases in contributions will berequired unless the real value of pension points is going to be allowed to fall.West Germany6. The State scheme in West Germany forms a much larger part of the totalpension provision than in the United Kingdom. Pensions range up to about 60 percent of revalued average earnings up to a ceiling which is revised each year, andwhich amounts in 1980 to DM 50,400 a year. Until recently, revaluation has beenin line with increases in average earnings based on the average figure for thethree preceding years, but the system has been under financial strain andspecially reduced index increases are being applied during the years 1979-81.7. Employers operate supplementary schemes to augment the State pension.There is a State scheme of insurance for schemes&apos; book reserves against the riskof bankruptcy. Indexation of pensions is not guaranteed, but there is arequirement on employers to review the level of pensions triennially in the lightof the needs of pensioners and the state of the company&apos;s finances. It is not yetclear how this will operate in practice. At the first review it was usually foundthat increases in the State pension had reduced the need for indexation of thesupplementary pensions and the Federal Courts normally regarded an increaserepresenting 50 per cent of the rise in the cost of living as adequate protection.The reduction in the rate of State scheme increases from 1979 onwards may leadthe Courts to require larger increases in supplementary pensions.Public servants8. In neither country are the arrangements described above applied to theCivil Service and other public servants. It is understood that their pensions arenormally linked to the pay of the current occupants of the posts which thepensioners previously occupied.(confidential)
(confidential)65APPENDIX 6: DERIVATION OF THE &apos;DEDUCTION&apos;1. The Government Actuary in his 1980 Report gave the value of the pensionof a civil servant as 16.8 per cent of his pay and that of the average analoguepension as 12.2 per cent of analogue pay. The difference between these figuresis 4.6 per cent and it needs to be explained how this was converted into a&apos;Deduction&apos; of 3.8 per cent.2. The purpose of the adjustments to analogue pay is to ensure that thepackage of pay (less pension contributions) and pension is the same for the civilservant and the analogue. Looking first at the analogue, for each  100 of grosspay, the analogue pays  4.3 in pension contributions and earns pension benefitsworth  12.2. An addition of  0.4 also has to be made for extra State schemebenefits to those not contracted-out. Thus the package of pay and pensions is 100 -  4.3 +  12.2 +  0.4, or  108.3 per  100 of analogue pay.3. Turning to the civil servant, the analogue pay is first reduced by  2.4 totake account of:(a) the difference between the average analogue contribution of 4.3 percent of pay and the male civil servant&apos;s 1.5 per cent; and(b) the extra State benefits to those not contracted-out.The resulting  97.6 has to be further reduced to such a sum as with the additionof 15.4 per cent (a pension worth 16.8 per cent of Civil Service pay less a 1.4 percent average contribution for family benefits) will produce the same totalpackage of  108.3. This means that Civil Service pay should be  108.3 divided by1.154, which is  93.85. Hence the  97.6 resulting from the first adjustmentneeds to be reduced by  3.75, which is 3.8 per cent of  97.6. This 3.8 per cent isthe &apos;Deduction&apos;.4. Similar principles apply in deriving a &apos;Deduction&apos; corresponding to any othervalues which may have been calculated for Civil Service and analogue pensions.(confidential)
(confidential)66APPENDIX 7: AN APPROACH TO ALLOWING FOR UNCERTAINTYIN VALUING PENSION SCHEMESNote by Professor R A Brealey and Dr S D HodgesIntroduction1. This note is a synopsis of our report &quot;The Value of Superannuation Benefitsin the Civil Service and Comparable Private Employment&quot;. The purpose of thereport was to estimate how allowance for uncertainty might affect estimates ofthe value of the Civil Service and private sector pension schemes.Why risk matters2. In order to measure how much a pension plan contributes to an individual&apos;sremuneration, we calculated the present value of his expected benefits and thepresent value of his expected salary receipts. We then expressed the presentvalue of these benefits as a percentage of the present value of salary. We calledthis the &quot;contribution rate&quot;.3. In order to calculate present values we need a discount rate. Theappropriate discount rate is the return that individuals could expect to earn froman equally risky investment in the capital market. Thus, in order to measure thepresent value of pension benefits, we needed to estimate:(a) the riskiness of these benefits; and(b) the expected return on an investment with equivalent risk.As an index-proofed pension is less risky than a non-indexed pension, indexedbenefits should be discounted at a lower rate than non-indexed benefits.Simplified schemes4. As we did not have access to full details of the Civil Service and analoguepension schemes, our estimates were based on simplified versions of theseschemes. Our first step was to check that our simplified versions were likely tobe reasonable approximations to the actual schemes. We did this by estimatingcontribution rates for the schemes using estimates of discount rate, inflation
(confidential)67rate etc similar to those used by the Government Actuary in 1980. We also madeestimates of the effect of different degrees of inflation-protection. Wecompared our estimates with the figures quoted by the Government Actuary.The results are shown below.TABLE 8:   Validation of estimates using simplified versions of the schemesContribution rates as percentage of pensionable payGovernment Our estimates usingActuary&apos;s simplified versionsfigures of the schemesCurrent assumptions:Civil Service 16.8 16.5Average of analogues 12.2 12.2Difference 4.6 4.3No index-linking:Civil Service 11.1 11.0Average of analogues 9.2 9.2Difference 1.9 1.8Full index-linking:Civil Service 16.8 16.5Average of analogues 14.5 14.7Difference 2.3 1.85. These results suggest that we are unlikely to have induced major errors inour estimates by using simplified versions of the schemes.Sensitivity analysis6. Next, we conducted a simple sensitivity analysis on the above estimates. Inother words, we changed just one of our initial assumptions slightly while holdingall else constant and recorded the effect on the estimated contribution. Wefound that contribution rates (and to a lesser extent the difference between thetwo sets of contribution rates) are quite sensitive to minor changes in theinflation rate, the retirement age and the degree of inflation protection and,most of all, in the discount rate.Choice of discount rate7. Having established that the choice of discount rate can make a large(confidential)
(confidential)68difference to our estimate of the value of these pension schemes we then tried todetermine what rate of discount should be used.8. The important thing about the discount rate is that it should depend on theriskiness of the cash flows. In the case of an index-linked pension scheme, thesecash flows are proportional to those on an index-linked bond. Therefore, theyshould be discounted at the yield which we would expect to receive from such abond.9. When an actuary assesses whether a pension fund is adequately funded, heconsiders the return that may reasonably be expected from the pension fund.This is an appropriate measure if we wish to estimate whether the fund can beexpected to meet its obligations on &quot;best guess&quot; assumptions about the future;but it is not the appropriate measure for determining the value of a pension onwhich there is no risk of default. Just as we do not measure the value of a gilt-edged security with a certain cash flow in money terms by discounting its cashflows at the expected rate of return on a pension fund portfolio, so we cannotmeasure the value of an index-linked investment with a cash flow deemed to becertain in real terms (the Civil Service pension) by discounting its benefits at theexpected return on the pension fund portfolio. Putting the matter in anotherway, we can say that the question of how people might value the element ofcertainty of a fully-indexed pension can be answered in principle by saying whatwould be the return on an indexed default-free bond. The more highly peoplevalued certainty, the lower, ceteris paribus, would be its required rate of return.10. Our problem, therefore, was to estimate the real return that investorswould require from an index-linked bond. We had two obvious clues. The SAYE(Third Issue) is widely held on a real return of approximately zero. Also TreasuryBills, which are risk-free in nominal terms, have, over long periods, provided anaverage real return of zero. Since we suspect that individuals would prefer evenmore to hold securities that are risk-free in real terms, a competitive yield onindex-linked bonds may be somewhat less than this figure.The simulation model11. As a check on this, we needed first to estimate the range of possible cashflows that can happen.   To do this we continued to make the same assumptions(confidential)
(confidential)69about Civil Service and analogue pension schemes as before except that theinflation rate was assumed to be uncertain around the assumed average of 7 percent. To measure what could happen to inflation over a 75 year period (ie fromage 25 to age 100), we made use of a simulation model developed by Hodges andCooper. This required us to specify the expected inflation rate, the variability ofthe inflation rate and the extent to which high or low inflation rates tend topersist. The model then provided us with 100 possible scenarios of inflation overa 75 year period. We used the Government Actuary&apos;s &quot;expected&quot; inflation rate of7 per cent and drew on post-war experience to postulate the variability ofinflation about this figure. The principal inputs for the simulation model aresummarised in Annex A.12. Our simulation provided us with estimates of the expected real salary andreal pension benefits for the civil servant and private sector employee. We thenused the simulation model to create, for each year, a portfolio of existingsecurities that replicates as near as possible an index-linked bond, or moreprecisely one that gives the same expected cash flow each year as the CivilService pension scheme with the minimum amount of uncertainty. Then wecalculated the expected real return on the portfolio. The procedure is describedin more detail in Annex B. The real discount rate that we obtained using thisprocedure was -0.9 per cent a year.13. As the benefits from the analogue schemes are not fully inflation protectedit is reasonable to discount these benefits at a slightly higher rate. For simplicitywe assumed that these benefits were 62 per cent index-linked, but it is importantto note that this assumption may result in some over valuing of the benefits,since the expected degree of inflation protection for the analogues is notguaranteed. Once again we estimated the discount rate by estimating theexpected return on a portfolio of existing securities that would provide returnssimilar to those of a partially indexed pension. Our estimates suggested thatinvestors would be prepared to hold a 62 per cent index-linked bond on a realyield of -0.3 per cent. That is, they would require an additional real return of0.6 per cent per annum to compensate them for the extra uncertainty of a 62 percent indexed bond.(confidential)
(confidential)70Estimated contribution rate14. We used these real discount rates of -0.9 per cent and -0.3 per cent tocalculate the present value of the benefit stream and the salary stream. CivilService salaries and pension benefits were discounted at a real rate of -0.9 percent. Benefits for private sector employees were discounted back to retirementage at a real rate of -0.3 per cent and from retirement age to age 25 at a realrate of -0.9 per cent (because salaries are assumed, in effect, to be fully indexedin the Government Actuary&apos;s calculations). The contribution rate can beexpressed as the ratio of these two present values. The results are shown below.TABLE 9:   Derivation of contribution rates on our suggested basisCivil ServicePresent value per  1 initial salary of:Benefits   44.93Salary   107.66Contribution rate41.7%Analogue  39.89  128.6731.0%15. Our estimates of the contribution rates for both schemes are substantiallyhigher than those of the Government Actuary and so is our estimate of thedifference in contribution rates: 10.7 per cent versus 4.6 per cent. But we pointout that this difference may be a slight under-estimate, for we have assumed adefinite figure for the extent of indexing in the analogue schemes. We have notattempted to allow for the uncertainty of this figure itself, the effect of whichwould depend largely on whether it was expected to move in the same directionas inflation itself or not.Summary16.    Our principal conclusions are as follows:(a) estimates of the value of the Civil Service and analogue pensionschemes are very sensitive to estimates of the discount rate,expected inflation rate, retirement age and the degree of inflationprotection; we should, therefore, not expect to be able to makeprecise estimates of value;(b) in estimating the value of the pension scheme, cash flows should be(confidential)
(confidential)71discounted at a rate that reflects the riskiness of these cash flows;the discount rate should not depend on the mix of investmentsactually chosen by the funds;(c) for a fully-indexed scheme, the appropriate discount rate is the yieldthat would obtain on an indexed bond;(d) our best estimate of the real discount rate is -0.9 per cent for a fullyindex-linked investment and -0.3 per cent for a 62 per cent index-linked investment; and(e) on these assumptions, our best estimate of the difference betweenthe value of the Civil Service and analogue pension schemes, as aproportion of salary, is 10.7 per cent; the figure compares with theGovernment Actuary&apos;s estimate of 4.6 per cent.Reference: I Cooper and S Hodges &quot;A Portfolio Simulation Model for UK PensionFunds&quot;; London Business School, 1979.(confidential)

(confidential)73Annex B:Estimates of the discount rate1. We initially estimated discount rates for each of years 5, 10, 15 ... 75(corresponding to ages 30 through 100). For each year the estimation procedurewas as follows:(a) we used the simulation model to generate 100 possible scenarios ofsalaries or pension benefits;(b) we also used the model to generate 100 possible future values foreach of the following investments:(i) a diversified equity portfolio;(ii) Treasury bills;(iii) a fund that is invested continuously in long gilts; and(iv) a  fund  that   maintains   a  balanced  investment   in equities,(c) we then estimated what combination of the four investments(including both long and short positions) would best replicate thesalaries or pension benefits; these investments were chosen so that:(i) their expected future value is identical to the future salary orpension benefits; and(ii) the variation in the real shortfall or excess is minimized; and(d) the discount rate for that year&apos;s cash flow is then equal to theexpected return on the portfolio of investments.2. In general, our estimates suggested that one can best replicate the cashflow from an index-linked pension scheme by a mixture of long-term borrowingand a large investment in short-term fixed interest investments. The impliedreal discount rates varied between -0.3 per cent and -1.5 per cent for a fullyindex-linked cash flow and between zero and -0.4 per cent for a 62 per centindex-linked flow. Rather than use different discount rates for individual yearswe took the average rates of -0.9 per cent for any fully index-linked cash flowand -0.3 per cent for any 62 per cent linked cash flow.Treasury bills and long gilts;
