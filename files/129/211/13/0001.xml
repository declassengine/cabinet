CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(81) 136 April 1981CABINETTHE PAY OF MPs, MINISTERS AND JUNIOR MINISTERS IN THEHOUSE OF LORDSMemorandum by the Lord President of the Council and the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster and Paymaster GeneralINTRODUCTION1. In this memorandum we make proposals on the salaries to be paid fromthis summer to Members of Parliament (MPs) and Ministers, and on thespecial problem of the pay of junior Ministers in the House of Lords.BACKGROUND2. In 1979 the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) in their 12th Reportrecommended salary increases for MPs and Ministers which, because of theirsize, the Government decided to implement in three annual stages on 13 June1979, 1980-Ktt&lt;L19-81.   The first stage was implemented in 1979.    In 1980 theTSRB (15th Report) recommended updating increases for the second (1980) andthird (1981) stages.    The Government decided not to accept these recommenda-tions.    It proposed and Parliament eventually approved increases of 9. 6 percent (5 per cent for Cabinet Ministers) in the second and third stages. Themodified second stage salaries are now ir payment, and the modified thirdstage salaries will come into effect on 13 June 1981 without any further action onthe part of Government or Parliament under the resolution and statutoryinstrument passed last year.3. On 21 July 1980 the then Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster undertookto Parliament that the TSRB would be asked to review the third stage increasedue in 1981, and he said that the Government would implement the results of thethird sta^e review &quot;unless there are clear and compelling reasons not to do&apos;so&quot;.On 8 August 1980 the Prime Minister formally invited the TSRB to undertake areview of MPs&apos; and Ministers&apos; pay for 1981.COPY NO81iCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4. In February 1981 the House of Commons agreed that a SelectCommittee should be appointed to consider the desirability and possible methodof conducting reviews of Members&apos; salaries by an independent body once duringeach Parliament and of adjusting salaries between reviews by leference toincreases in the remuneration of a designated group of outside occupations(&quot;linkage to a basket&quot;).5. For its other clients the TSRB has recently decided (with theGovernment&apos;s agreement) not to recommend new salary rates this year, but tourge the Government to implement in full and as soon as possible therecommendations they made last year (which the Government abated by about50 per cent overall) and to promise a full-scale review for 1982. TheChairman of the TSRB has indicated that, having so decided for their otherclients, they would probably not wish to put forward new salary levels for MPsand Ministers this year;  but they are prepared to advise on the updating of theallowances.    He has asked whether the Prime Minister would nonetheless wishthem to proceed with the review which she commissioned in August 1980.SHOULD WE ASK THE TSRB TO CONDUCT A REVIEW IN 1981?6. The Cabinet need to decide now whether to ask the TSRB to conduct areview for 1981.    To decide not to do so would be a breach of the undertakinggiven to Parliament and would mean withdrawing the request made to theReview Body (paragraph 3).    The embarrassment of that course of action hasto be set against the embarrassment that would be created by a new set ofrecommendations.    We have no doubt that in present circumstances, andespecially in the light of the Government&apos;s stance on public service pay, theright course is to agree that the Review Body should not propose new salaryrates but should deal with MPs&apos; and Ministers&apos; pay as they have dealt withtheir other clients.WHAT TO DO ABOUT MPs&apos; PAY THIS YEAR7. If the Review Body does not recommend new rates for MPs&apos; pay, theCabinet will have to decide what to propose. A final decision is not neededyet;  but the Cabinet should begin to form a view.8. The options are:A.      To increase the rate currently in payment by 6 per cent, from 11, 750 to  12, 500.    This is the only option which would be strictly in.line with the agreed pay factor for cash limits and the Government&apos;sstance on public service pay.    But it would involve asking Parliamentto agree a salary rate less than the  13,150 which has already beenapproved.    We think that that is politically out of the question, thoughwe are under no illusions that any other option involver percentageincreases between 1980-81 and 1981-82 well out of line with what thepublic services are being required to accept.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALB. To let the figure of  13,150, fixed last year to take effect from13 June 1981, stand unchanged:  an increase of about 1Z per cent on thisyear&apos;s salary.     MPs would regard this as tantamount to a breach of theundertaking that the third stage would be reviewed and updated (s eparagraph 3), but it would have the merit of producing an increase inline with those roming through in the public sector utilities (electricity,gas, water and coa.1), and the advantage of being the result of doingnothing.    An Order in Council would still be needed, however, to give iffect to the special increase for Parliamentary Secretaries, Whips andother office holders in the Lords (see paragraph 13).C. To implement from 13 June 1981 the third stage figure of  13, 750recommended by the TSF.B in 1980:   an increase of about 17 per cent onthis year&apos;s salary, and of about 5 per cent on the  13,150 fixed lastyear.    This would catch up with the TSRB recommendations last year,and thus complete the three-stage increases begun in 1979 and complywith a recommendation (if tho TSRB were to make it - see paragraphs 5and 6) that the Government should implement their 1980 recommendationin full as soon as possible.    But MPs would be deprived of a 1981updating on the third stage recommended by the TSRB.D. To increase the figure of  13,150 fixed lt-st year by 6 per cent to(say)  13,950:   an increase of about 18;f per cent on this year&apos;s salary.This would overtake the TSRB&apos;s 1980 recommendation, and would giveMPs the same rate of increase over the 1981 salary fixed last year asthe public services are being asked to accept.R.       To increase the figure of  13, 750 recommended by the; TSRB in1980 by 6 per cent, to (say)  14, 575:   an increase of about 24 per cent onthis year&apos;s salary, and of about 11 per cent on the  13,150 fixed lastyear.    This would bring MPs&apos; salaries unquestionably and completelyup to date, but would on any reckoning be considerably more generousthan what the public services are being asked to accept.9. We should welcome the views of Cabinet on these options.    We excludeOptions A and E.     We doubt whether Option B would be acceptable toParliament.    A decision for Option C - the  13,750 recommended by the TSRBlast year - would invite the other TSRB groups (higher civil servants, seniorofficers and judges) and also the nationalised industry board members whom weremoved from TSRB&apos;s remit following the last report to argue that they wouldbe discriminated against if they did not also get the rates recommended forthem by *he TSRB last year.    The Government has already decided that boardmembers should not automatically move to the 1980 TSRB recommended ratesthis year.    If another group is to receive these rates, there will be strongcriticism from board members.    We therefore favour Option D -  13,150 plus6 per cent - which could be represented as honouring the completion of the3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthree-stage increases and giving MPs the same updating increase as otherpublic services, and as being consistent wilh the cash limit philosophy (itwould       consistent with the cash limits which provide for Ministers to receivetin- third stage plus h |kt cent).PAY OF MINISTERS10. In relation to Ministers the same options are available and the sameconsiderations apply.   We recommend parity oi treatment for Ministers withwhatever is agreed for MPs.     Wo therefore favour Option D:   the alreadyagreed third stage increase plus 6 per cent.JUNIOR MINISTERS IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS11. In her statement to the House ol Commons an 7 July i ho the PrimeMinister said:&apos;Although junior Ministers in the House of Lord; now receive aseer tarial allowance of  1,000,  which we propose to increase to 1,100, tney do not receive .my salary spec it&apos;ically in respei I ol theirParliamentary duties.    This is a very real problem, and we propone toconsider how the arrangements for their remuneration should berevised to take account of it&quot;.1Z. Since then the Cabinet has twice considered how beat to makeprovision for junior Ministers in the House of Lords to receive a sum of about 3, 500 a year over and above their existing Ministerial salaries, if possiblewithout new primary Legislation.13. In accordanc e with the Cabinet&apos;s wishes we have explored the possibilityof proceeding by means of some Parliamentary allowance (either a spoeia!allowance or a variant on one of the existing allowances), but we are satisfiedthat there is no way in which this can bo done, at any rate to produce asupplementary amount of the sum required,  which would not be a transparentlydisguised increase in remuneration.    Short of primary legislation, the only wayin which the desired results can be achieved is as follows:i.        Ministers of StateThe Ministerial and Other Salaries Act 1975 gives the Prime Ministerdiscretion to fix the salaries of certain Ministers (other than CabinetN/inisters) within a range which at present is from  16,250 to  19,300.At present Ministers of State in the Commons receive  16; 250 andMinisters of State in the Lords  16,400.    It would accordingly bepossible, without the need for primary Legislation or ;&gt; I   solution, topay Ministers of State in the Lords in future at the top of the range andto keep Ministers of State in the Commons at the bottom.     The range isat present  3,050 wide;   it could be in&lt; leased to  3, 500 when newsalary rates are introduced by Order in Council.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALii. Parliamentary SecretariesThe Ministerial and Other Salaries Act 1975 prescribes a single salaryfigure (at present  12,500) for Parliamentary Secretaries, butSection 4(2) of the Act provides that the salaries specified by the Act aremaxima, and thu.t lower salaries may be paid (ParliamentarySecretaries in the Commons at present receive only  12, 350). Whennext the salary rates are changed by Order in Council, it would bepossible to fix the maximum salary for Parliamentary Secretaries atthe level considered appropriate for Parliamentary Secretaries ill theLords, which would be  3, 500 more than the revised salary forParliamentary Secretaries in the Commons calculated in accordancewith whichever of the Options in paragraph 8 above the Cabinet decidedto adopt.    This maximum salary would be paid only to ParliamentarySecretaries in the Lords;  and, ~clyir.g on Section 4(2) of the Act,Parliamentary Secretaries in the Common;? would be paid  3, 500 leos.Parliament would have to be told of the proposed use to be made ofSection 4(2).iii. Other Office Holders and WhipsThe salaries of Law Officers, other office holders and Whips in theLords could be separately dealt with by Order in Council.14. These proposals would have the presentational disadvantage that thesalary presented as the maximum for Parliamentary Secretaries would be 3, 500 greater than most of them (those in the Commons) would actuallyreceive.    It might be argued that tha exercise of the Prime Minister&apos;sdiscretion to provide for differential salary payments to Ministers of State inthe two Houses was a device to avoid the need for legislation;   but thediscretion has been used in a very similar way before.    Notwithstanding thesedisadvantages, we consider that these proposals constitute the best way ofachieving the Cabinet&apos;s objectives.    If colleagues agree that we should proce idalong these lines, the proposals could be^t be announced as part of a moregeneral statement on new salary rates.CONCLUSION15. The salrvry rates resulting from the various Options set out inparagraph 8 and the proposals set out in paragraph 13 are set out in an ann^xto this paper.16. We invite the Cabinet to agree that:-a.       The Prime Minister should tell the Chairman of the TSRB thatshe will be content for the Review Body not to recommend new salaryrates for MPs and Ministers, but to urge full implementation of theirearlier recommendations as soon as possible.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALb. The Review Body should be asked to advise on thfl updating ofParliamentary allowanc et.c. We should plan on the basis of inereasing MPs&apos; and Ministe -s&apos;pay to the third stage LevelB fixed last year plus 6 per rent, with offertfrom 13 June 19pl (Option D).d. Junior Ministers, other office holders and Whips in the Lordsshould be provided for as proposed in paragraph 13 above.SF PCivil Service Department6 April 19816CONFIDENTIAL
