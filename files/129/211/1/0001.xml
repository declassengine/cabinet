If the Government favour a single authority, should thisdecision be announced by means of a Green Paper, leaving some ofthe questions at 2. and 3. above open for further consideration, or bymeans of a White Paper ?Signed       ROBERT ARMSTRONGCabinet Office5 January 19812CONFIDENTIAL
ANNEX APRIME MINISTERJflJ&apos;JU&amp;E OF I.L.E.A.H Committee considered on Tuesday the report of the MinisterialCommittee on the future of the Inner London Education Authority(H(30) 76).We readily endorsed that Committee&apos;s view that the presentarrangements are less than satisfactory.   I.L.E.A. is constituted by acomplex and ill-understood mixture of election and nomination. Itspends and precepts without regard to the claims of other services onthe available resources.   Its unit costs for schools are by far thehighest in England.   Performance - particularly in secondary educationis patchy and by no means commensurate with expenditure.As the report of the Ministerial Committee made clear, there are,however, strong arguments against the break up of I.L.E.A. and thetransfer of any or all of its functions to the boroughs.   A singleauthority is needed for higher, further and special education and thecareers service.   It is in the interests of both young people andemployers not to separate these functions from primary and secondaryeducation.   Many of the Inner London boroughs would be too small toprovide adequate schooling when school rolls are falling, especiallysince school catchment areas bear no relation to borough boundaries.Moreover, the performance of some Inner London boroughs in providingother services at reasonable cost leaves much to be desired.There would also be difficult problems of financing smallereducation authorities.   The very large contribution new made byrate-payers in the City and Westminster would have to be found eitherby English rate-payers genrally through the block grant or by thetax-payer.
A majority of the members of H Committee therefore concluded thata single education authority had to he retained for Inner London. Wewere reluctant to come to this conclusion and were conscious of thepolitical difficulties.   We were reminded, however, that ourpredecessors in the Mcmillan Government had reached the same view. Werecognise that the decision will require careful handling and fullexplanation to the Party, not least because of the recommendations madslby Kenneth Baker&apos;s Committee earlier this year.The report of the Ministerial Committee indicated that there werealready some pressures on I.L.E.A. to improve its performance.H.M. Inspectorate of Education&apos;s report has now been published. Underthe new block grant arrangements I.L.E.A. will, for the first time,receive its share of grant direct.   The arrangements are designed tobring pressure to bear on high spenders and the relationship betweenneeds assessment and actual expenditure will be known.   Sate-payers wil|know more clearly just how much of their rate is due to I.L.E.A.&apos;sprecept.H Committee then considered whether, given the very real faults oithe present arrangements, and the almost inbuilt Labour majority of asingle London authority, there was need for other changes.   We lookedat possible changes in the electoral, arrangements.   Transfer of I.L.E.J|to the G.L.C. as a whole can be ruled out.    It would be effective onljif outer London members were able to speak and vote.   This could not &quot;oejustified when their boroughs were not paying for the relevant educaticservice.   We also ruled out a directly-elected education authority.The alternative is to transfer responsibility for appointments toI.L.E.A. exclusively to the Inner London boroughs.   Such a proposal wasfirst put forward in a slightly different form by Lord Marshall in hisreport to the G.L.C. in 1978.   This &quot;Marshall Option&quot; has its
attractions in terms of greater financial responsibility and itsdisadvantages, not least that the minority party could well do worsthan at present, even if guaranteed some representation by statute.The Ministerial Committee drew attention to a number of ways inwhich financial controls in I.L.E.A. might be strengthened. (Thesechanges need not necessarily be linked with changes in the way thatmembers of the authority are elected.)   It is possible, for example,that a scheme of qualified majority voting on major financial issuescould be devised.   We have asked the Ministerial Committee to lookfurther at these various possibilities before we come to a view on therelative merits of the &quot;Marshall Option&quot; on the one hand and retainingI.L.E.A. as at present constituted on the other.I expect E Committee to give further consideration to thesematters next month.   We shall need to announce the Government&apos;sdecision well in advance of the G.L.C. elections and, given theimportance and difficulty of the issues, I am sure that Cabinet shouldhave a chance to consider them.   I suggest, however, that we do so onlywhen the full range of possibilities has been identified.I will report further to you after the resumed H discussion.I am sending copies of this minute to the other members of theCabinet, the Minister of Transport, the Chief Whip andSir Robert Armstrong.
ANNEX BPRIME MINISTER:. .... . . . EUTH2E OF I.L.E.A.Hy mirm-hA of 21st ITovember reported the outcome of theE Committee discussion on 18th ITovember of the Inner London EducationAuthority (I.L.E.A).   H Corraittee agreed then that the present localgovernment arrangements for education in inner London are far fromsatisfactory hut accepted, by a majority, the need to retain a singleeducation authority.   H. Committee wished to give furtherconsideration to the possibility identified by the MinisterialCommittee on the Fixture of the Inner London Education Authority (I.L)of making I.L.E.A. consist solely of members appointed by the innerLondon boroughs and the City (the liar shall Option), and asked thento look further at ways in which financial controls on I.L.E.A.might be strengthened.   (Such changes need not necessarily be linkedwith changes in the way that members of the authority are appointed.)E Committee considered I.L&apos;s further report (E(30) 35) on15th December.   I.L. had concluded that the most attractive (or leastunattractive) possibility would be to introduce a system under whichthe rate precept was more related to population in respect of theauthority&apos;s expenditure above a certain level.   In other words,above that level the precept would be related to the population ofeach borough and not its rateable value.   &apos;The effect would be thatthe rate burden imposed by I.L.E.A. would be redistributed at themargin so that a higher proportion was borne by the rate-payers ofthose boroughs for which most of the services were provided.Such an approach would be technically feasible, but there arevery considerable objections.   It would conflict with the basicrating T&gt;rircirie that ratepayers &quot;cay a common rate &quot;oourdase. Itwould be regressive, but only to the extent that expenditure exceededthe threshold.   It would bear hard on industry and on smallbusinesses in the poorer boroughs.   And it could set a dangerousgo^c         t the t&apos;^s&quot; w&quot;^&quot;      * *t~ c * c ~&quot; o  * ^ oc ^ ^ ~ut 0t*^ a s * inh*vuse to claim relief.   Cn the other hand it would ccme into play onlyif Councillors knowingly and deliberately budgeted for a level ofexpenditure above the threshold.   Z Committee accepted I.L&apos;s view
that there were very substantial objections to the other possibilitiesthat had been examined. These included a blocking mechanism in votin;the authority&apos;s budget, a fixed limit on I.L.E.A&apos;s expenditure, theextension of judicial review of the level of precept, and adjustmentof block grant.H Committee noted that very considerable changes are alreadyunder way.   Under block grant, grant will be paid for the first timedirect to I.L.E.A.   The rate support grant settlement has switchedgrant away from London so that there will be heavy pressure on allLondon rating boroughs to contain their expenditure. (Experiencenext year will therefore test the hypothesis that the prospect ofhigh rate increases puts councillors under effective pressure tocontain expenditure.)   In addition I.L.E.A. has now begun to adjustto falling school rolls which should yield savings and the publicationof H.Ii. Inspectorate&apos;s report will focus attention on the steps thatthe authority needs to take in order to remedy the deficiencieshigh-lighted by the report.Against this background, and having regard to our earlierreservations about the balance of advantage of the Harshall Option,the majority of the members of E Committee were dubious about thebenefits of possible changes which would, of course, requirelegislation.   The majority considered that it would be best in allthe circumstances to maintain the existing arrangements. (Wedeliberately refrained from examining more radical options that wentbeyond the local government arrangements for education in InnerLondon.)   Given the political importance of the matter, H Committeewere in no doubt that the Cabinet would wish to consider it beforeany decision was announced.-2-

ANNEX CPRIME MINISTERTHE FUTURE OF ILEA1. You asked me to report on the proposal made by Sir HoraceCutler and Professor David Smith that the outcome of theGovernment&apos;s inquiry should be a Green Paper which would ruleout the break-up of ILEA and canvass the possibility of changingits constitution so that its members were directly elected. Thiswould be a modern version of the London School Board which existedbetween 1870 and 1904.    The Herbert Commission of Local Governmentin Greater London, which reported in 1960, considered and rejectedthe possibility of reintroducing a School Board for inner London&apos;seducation system.    IL Committee discussed this &quot;School Board Option&quot;in paragraphs 27-28 of its report to H Committee, and recommendedagainst it.    H Committee agreed with this judgment.2. A directly elected ILEA would be an improvement on the presentarrangement Cand also to some extent on the Marshall Option)insofar as it created a direct and obvious link between innerLondon ratepayers and the LEA for the area.    It would plainly makeILEA directly accountable to those ratepayers.    It would put themon a par with other ratepayers in England by enabling them to electdirectly all the members of their LEA.3. It is a matter for judgment whether those who would turn outto vote for a directly elected ILEA would be more concerned toreduce its call on the rates or to support increased expenditureon education.    But it is clear that, because ILEA&apos;S members wouldnot have to balance the claims of education against those of otherservices towards which the inner London ratepayers contribute, theywould not be subject to a form of financial discipline which isintrinsic to the Marshall Option.    This is a serious drawback,since H Committee did not share Professor Smith1s confidence thatthe block grant system and the clear identification of ILEA&apos;Sprecept would provide sufficient incentives to financialresponsibility.4. The implementation and the political consequences of thedirect election of ILEA members are by no means easy or certain.5. We could use the GLC constituencies.    This would create anauthority with 35 members, soon to be reduced to about 28. Evenwith some members co-opted to the Education Committee  (as is normal)this would almost certainly be too small a membership for theeffective discharge of ILEA&apos;S responsibilities;  it might thereforebe necessary to have two members elected from each constituency.Alternatively, the constituencies for direct election could bespecially created.    This would have to be entrusted to the localGovernment Boundary Commission, whose other work might thus have tobe delayed.
6. Our supporters in ILEA believe that in an election foughton educational issues there would be strong support for ourpolicies which emphasise standards.    Educational issues would bemost likely to be prominent if elections to ILEA were held in ayear in which there were neither GLC nor London borough elections.But there would be a cost of at least Elm per election, and therecould also be a low turn-out.    We have no experience of electionsfor a major single-purpose local authority. These could resultnot in a clear majority for one of the major parties, but in anumber of parties, some of them based on local or educationalpressure groups, gaining sufficient representation to prevent anyclear majority emerging.    Local party organisations are likely tobe hostile to a change which might have unforeseeable results.7. Our supporters in ILEA are advocating the retention of asingle LEA for inner London based on the School Board Option, becausethey do not favour the Marshall Option but nevertheless feel thatsome change in ILEA&apos;s constitution is needed.    I believe, however,that if the Marshall Option is not to be preferred to the statusquo, the School Board Option is even less to be preferred becauseit provides less incentive to financial responsibility withoutgiving grounds for confidence that it will give rise to a moreacceptable composition of the membership.8. The case for a Green Paper rests on our willingness to entertain more than one option for ILEA&apos;s future.    If, for example, the Cabinetsaw merit in both the status quo and the Marshall Option,  a GreenPaper would be an apt instrument for canvassing both options. Itwould also be possible to include in a Green Paper the pros and consof the School Board Option, but if Cabinet agrees with therecommendations made by IL and H Committees it would have to bemade clear that these had been considered and the option ruled out.But whatever its contents, a Green Paper would have the disadvantagethat it would leave ILEA&apos;s future uncertain, and this would makeit much harder to achieve our objectives for education in innerLondon.    ILEA is most likely to take effective action to remedythe weaknesses identified in the HMI report, if its members canmake longer-term plans in the knowledge that the constitutionalissue   is settled, and if the teachers, whose co-operation isessential, are not confused by uncertainty about the futurearrangements under which they will be working.    Even an unequivocalGovernment statement that ILEA is not to be broken up will leavelingering doubts on that score if the constitution of ILEA remains&quot;unsettled.9. In my view, the alternative to a Green Paper is a White Paperwhich would explain in detail the reasons for not breaking up ILEA,the reasons why certain options had been rejected, the argumentsin favour of the Government&apos;s decision and how that decision wasdesigned to improve the education service in inner London.    If wefelt that, like the original decision to create ILEA, the present2 .
decision should be subject to review in due course, we should makeit clear that this review would not take place before say 10 yearshad elapsed.    That would be sufficiently far ahead to encouragethe necessary improvements in inner London1s education to be mademeanwhile.10.    I am sending copies of -this to members of Cabinet,includingthe Minister of Transport, the Chief Whip and Sir Robert Armstrong.BARONESS YOUNG(dictated by Lady Young andsigned in her absence)31 DEC 1980
