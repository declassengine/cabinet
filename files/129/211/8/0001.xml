ANNUAL REVIEW OF AGRICULTURE 1981INTRODUCTION1. This White Paper sets out the data considered during the Annual Reviewof the economic condition and prospects of the United Kingdom agriculturalindustry. The Government will draw on this information, as appropriate, whenconsidering proposals by the European Commission for agricultural support in1981/82 and when decisions are taken on support arrangements which remainwithin our national competence. As usual, these decisions will be announcedseparately. In most cases, the forecasts for 1980 in the White Paper were madein November 1980.PART I STATE OF THE INDUSTRY2. After a wet winter and a very dry spring, excellent growing and harvestingconditions ensured a record cereals harvest in England. Elsewhere, particularlyin Scotland, the weather was wetter than usual and the harvest was badlyaffected. Net product at constant prices, which measures in volume terms thecontribution from agriculture to the corresponding net national product, roseby some 11%. This followed a small decrease of about 1% in 1979. Theincrease in 1980 is mainly accounted for by a rise in the output of cereals. Inaddition, farmers made some economies in the use of inputs, particularlyfeedingstuffs. The average prices paid for the industry&apos;s inputs increased bysome 14%. Prices of outputs, on the other hand, only increased by some 6%.Even allowing for the increased output, the industry experienced a squeeze onits profitability. The sum of farming income, net rent and interest is expected torise by \\% in 1980, a fall of 14% in real terms. Farming income alone isexpected to fall by some 10%, which is a fall of some 24% in real terms. Thevolume of new fixed investment in agriculture is expected to decline by some10%. Government action in 1979 to reduce the United Kingdom&apos;s negativemonetary compensatory amount by devaluations of the green pound, togetherwith the strengthening of the market rate for sterling, meant that the competitivedisadvantage against our producers was entirely eliminated for most productsby the end of January 1980. The further strengthening of sterling since then hasgiven rise to positive monetary compensatory amounts on United Kingdomtrade since last April.3. Cereals yields were high and production in 1980 is expected to rise toabout 19.2 million tonnes. Potato yields were also very good. The yield perhectare of sugar beet may be higher than in 1979 with a lower sugar content.There was a marked increase in the area of oilseed rape and yields were higher.The area devoted to horticultural crops declined again in 1980.4. The dairy herd at June 1980 was 2% smaller than in 1979, but milkproduction over the whole year is expected to increase by nearly \%. The beefherd fell by over Z\% and home production of beef was about the same levelas in 1979. The sheep breeding flock increased again and the lamb crop wasexceptionally high; production of sheepmeat is expected to increase by some13% in 1980. The size of the pig breeding herd fell slightly during 1980;supplies of home-fed pigmeat are likely to be some 3% lower. Production ofpoultrymeat showed little change in 1980 whilst egg production declined.1
PART II GENERAL DEVELOPMENTSFarm structure (Table 3)5. The number of farms in the United Kingdom has continued to decline. In1980 the total number of holdings was about 243,500, about 5% fewer than thecorresponding figure in 1975. The fall in numbers continued to be most markedamong the smaller full-time businesses. Half the total number of holdings havebusinesses capable of providing work for at least one full-time man (ie thoseof 250 standard man-days or more) and these account for over 90% of totaloutput. Large businesses of 1,000 standard man-days, although only some 12%of the total number, accounted for about half of total output. In NorthernIreland and Wales the output of small-scale farmers is rather more significantthan in other parts of the United Kingdom.6. The average area (including rough grazings) of a full-time business of 250standard man-days or more has risen since 1975 from 111 hectares to 116hectares. The size of individual enterprises continues to expand. There hasbeen an increase over the last five years in the average area of cereals from 30to 37 hectares, while the average dairy herd has grown over this period bynearly 28% from 40 to 51 cows. The average size of a beef breeding herd hasstabilised at 18 cows, but the average ewe flock has risen to 181 breeding sheepcompared with 168 in 1975. The average size of a pig breeding herd hasincreased from 23 to 34 sows, while fattening herds have reached an averagesize of 229 compared with 161 in 1975.7. In Great Britain 66% of the holdings were wholly or mainly owner-occupied in 1980 compared with 54% in 1960/61. The proportion of the totalarea held by owner-occupiers has increased from 52% in 1960/61 to 58% in1980. In Northern Ireland virtually all farmers are owner-occupiers.Index of net product (Table 22)8. The index of net product at constant prices for 1980 is expected to riseto 128 after a slight reduction in 1979 when it fell to 115. The improvementis mainly a result of this year&apos;s record cereal crop and some savings on inputswhich included reductions in purchases of feedingstuffs and economies in use offuel. This index and the income data in paragraph 10 show average figuresaround which there are significant regional variations.Labour productivity (Tables 4 and 22)9. The index of labour productivity measures changes in gross agriculturalproduct, at constant prices, per person engaged. It reflects improvements in,for example, plant and animal breeding and the capital stock, the decline in thenumber of persons engaged and short-term movements in output caused bysuch factors as weather conditions. The index has increased on average byabout 4% annually during the 1970s. After an increase of less than 1% in1979 a 10% increase is forecast in 1980. This reflects the higher level of outputin 1980 and a further fall in the labour force. The number of regular whole-time workers fell by 4 % in 1978/79 and a fall of 3|% is estimated for 1979/80compared with an annual average reduction of 4% during the 1970s.Farming income (Tables 21, 22 and 24)10. The sum of farming income, net rent and interest (which togetherrepresent all the returns to the capital invested in the industry) is expected to2
rise by \\% in 1980, a fall of 14% in real terms. Farming income alone, asdefined in Table 21, is estimated to have declined by 8% in 1979 to  1,145million, and a further reduction of 10% is forecast for 1980. In real terms thisrepresents a fall of 19% between 1978 and 1979 followed by a fall of about24% in 1980. The fall in income reflects the fact that the increase in expendi-ture on inputs is much greater than the increase in the value of sales. Deprecia-tion, labour and interest (on increased borrowings) rose sharply in 1980.11. Further information is provided at the Annual Review from samples offarm accounts which examine the financial position of farming analysed bysize and type of farm and by country and region. The coverage and certain ofthe concepts in this series differ from the aggregate calculation. No directcomparisons between the two series can therefore be made. In particular thefarm accounts relate to full-tiins farms only, though they do not cover verylarge farms (notably in the poultry sector); and the main analyses do not coverhorticultural holdings. There are differences in the treatment of stock apprecia-tion and valuations, which can affect the year to which income from individualenterprises is attributed. The sample accounts relate to a year ending, onaverage, in mid-February; and interest on farming loans is not deducted.12. Information from the farm accounts for 1979/80 (for the year ending inFebruary 1980) shows that net income per farm fell on almost all farmingtypes. The decline was particularly severe on hill and upland (LFA) farmsthroughout the United Kingdom and on lowland cattle and sheep farms in allcountries except Scotland. This reflected the unfavourable weather in late 1978and the first half of 1979, and weak livestock markets. The decline in incomeson dairy farms in Scotland and Northern Ireland was particularly marked.General cropping farms in England maintained their recovery from the lowlevels of income in 1977/78, and there was an improvement in Scotland aftertwo bad years. Incomes fell on cereal farms in England.13. Forecasts of the results for 1980/81 (for the year ending on average inFebruary 1981) suggest that there will be some increase in incomes on hilland upland farms in England and in Wales from the low levels reached in1979/80, and also on some types of hill and upland farms in Scotland, but inNorthern Ireland the decline in income in the hill areas is expected to continuein 1980/81. Net income on all types of hill and upland farms is expected toremain below the 1978/79 levels in all countries. Hill livestock producers willbenefit from the  7.50 increase in the rate of allowance for cows and the 75pincrease in the higher rate for sheep which will apply from 1 January 1981.The effect of these higher rates will, however, not be fully reflected in theaccounts in all countries until 1981/82. Further falls in incomes are expectedon dairy farms, on some lowland cattle and sheep farms and on general crop-ping farms growing potatoes and sugar beet. No improvement in incomes isforecast for cereal farms or for pigs and poultry farms. On all types of farmthe expected levels of income in 1980/81, in real terms, are substantially belowthose of 1978/79. The decline in this period is most marked on dairy farms, onsome cattle and sheep farms, and on all farm-types in Northern Ireland.Price changes14. The price of outputs rose on average by nearly 6% between 1979 and1980. Price increases for most individual commodities were at or a little abovethis level (though with marked regional differences). But potato prices fell by3
18%. Prices of inputs increased on average by about 14% between 1979 and1980. Within this total, prices of bought-in goods and services showed a riseof about 11%.Gross capital formation (Table 19)15. It is estimated that the value of new investment will increase again in1980, with the industry&apos;s gross capital formation in fixed assets of  1,056million some 4% higher than in 1979. Investment in buildings and works isexpected to be  509 million, a rise of 31% compared with the 1979 level, whileinvestment in plant, machinery and vehicles is expected to decline by 13% to 547 million. In volume terms, however, total gross fixed capital formation isexpected to decline by 10% compared with the level in 1979. While a 7% riseis expected in the volume of buildings and works (following a decline of some3% in 1979) new investment in plant, machinery and vehicles is expected tofall by 23%.16. A rise in stock appreciation and a small net increase in volume causedby higher cereal stocks contributed to an estimated increase of some 30% in1980 in the value of stocks and work-in-progress. For the second successiveyear the total capital invested in breeding livestock (other than sheep) is fore-cast to decline in value and in volume.Bank borrowings17. Bank advances to agriculture for 1980 as a whole are forecast to beabout  2,900 million, some 30% above the average for 1979 and some 70%above 1978. The rising level of borrowings reflects some increase in loans forland purchase and for increased costs of investment in buildings and works,but is probably mainly for current farming purposes.Agricultural land prices (Table 23)18. Agricultural land prices have risen considerably since 1975. Informationfrom the comprehensive Inland Revenue series indicates that, in 1979, theaverage price per hectare of agricultural land sold with vacant possessionreached  3,227 in England,  2,482 in Wales,  1,983 in Scotland and  3,327 inNorthern Ireland. The more up-to-date but less comprehensive Current Agri-cultural Land Prices series, which covers England and Wales only, indicatesthat vacant possession prices remained at broadly their 1979 levels for much of1980 but declined towards the end of the year.Farm rents (Table 23)19. On the basis of the provisional results of the ADAS Annual RentEnquiry in England and Wales and of the continuing field survey in Scotland,average farm rents in the United Kingdom are estimated to have increased by17% in 1980. This compares with an increase of 19% in 1979.Farm workers&apos; earnings (Table 20)20. The average weekly earnings of whole-time hired men in the UnitedKingdom averaged  71.90 for 46.2 hours in the calendar year 1979 and  61.75for 45.8 hours in the calendar year 1978; an increase of about 16^% in moneyterms and 2^% in real terms. Average earnings in 1980 are forecast to beabout  86.50 for 45.7 hours, an increase of 20% in money terms, and less than
2% in real terms. Proposals made in November and December 1980 would,if confirmed, increase the statutory minimum weekly wage rates for whole-time hired workers in England and Wales by 10.3% with effect from 21January 1981, for general workers in Scotland by 10.5% from 16 February1981 and for agricultural workers in Northern Ireland by 10.3% from2 February 1981.Public expenditure (Table 25)21. Expenditure under the common market organisation of the EuropeanCommunity is estimated to be about  568 million in 1980/81 compared withexpenditure of some  360 million in 1979/80. This expenditure by the Inter-vention Board for Agricultural Produce includes the Butter and School MilkSubsidies, the Beef and Sheepmeat Premium Schemes, import and exportrefunds (net of levies), certain production subsidies, aids to animal feeds, thegross costs of aid to private storage and the net cost of commodities bought intointervention and subsequently sold. Some of this expenditure benefits con-sumers and trade interests rather than producers. The additional expenditurein 1980/81 is mainly due to increased intervention activity for cereals and beef,to increased payments under the Beef Premium Scheme and to provision forthe new Sheepmeat Premium Scheme. There has been less expenditure on aidsto animal feeds and receipts from the co-responsibility levy on milk producershave increased.22. In 1980/81, the estimated outturn for expenditure in the United Kingdomon price guarantees, grants and subsidies (excluding the brucellosis incentives)is  410 million compared with  317 million in 1979/80, which included  32million of payments deferred from 1978/79 as a result of industrial action.Expenditure for 1980/81 includes the new suckler cow premium scheme. Inaddition the cost of capital grants and of guarantee payments for sheep, wooland potatoes has risen.23. A breakdown of expenditure by scheme and commodity is set out inTable 25.PART III COMMODITY TRENDSCereals (Tables 2, 5, 7 and 26)24. In 1980, cereals were grown on some 3.95 million hectares, an increaseof 0.07 million hectares over 1979. Favourable weather conditions in theautumn of 1979 led to an increase in the area planted to wheat and a continuedshift from spring to winter barley. The area planted to oats also increased.Yields in 1980 were high and the quality of the crop was generally good.Production reached about 19.2 million tonnes, some 1.8 million tonnes abovethe level in 1979. In the early part of 1980, with supplies in surplus, pricesweakened but recovered later, as export trade developed. Then, with the largeharvest, prices fell to below support levels, and up to 650,000 tonnes of grainare likely to be sold to the intervention authorities. Favourable conditions inthe autumn of 1980 meant that the sowing of winter cereals has again proceededwell.Oilseed rape (Tables 2, 5, 8 and 26)25. Production is expected to rise again in 1980 to a record level of 275,000tonnes, which is 40% higher than production in 1979. The increase is due to5
an expansion in area sown from 74,000 to 93,000 hectares and a higher averageyield. It is estimated that the area under the 1981 crop is some 15% higherand, if yields are maintained, production will rise again in 1981. The averageprice of the crop improved in 1980, in line with the increase in the interventionprice.Potatoes (Tables 2, 5, 9 and 26)26. Plantings in 1980 exceeded the target area of 196,000 hectares by some9,000 hectares. Planting and growing conditions were generally good and thisproduced record yields in many areas. The Potato Marketing Board was againauthorised to offer contracts to producers in Great Britain for a proportion oftheir crop with the aim of ensuring stability in the market throughout theseason. 423,000 tonnes were placed under contract in this way. Sales forstockfeed in both Great Britain and Northern Ireland began in November whenit was clear that there was a surplus and when prices were still depressed.27. Discussions on the future support arrangements are continuing, takingaccount of the prospects for an agreement on a Community regime forpotatoes.Sugar beet (Tables 2, 5, 10 and 26)28. For 1980 the British Sugar Corporation contracted to purchase the beetfrom 215,000 hectares. 213,000 hectares were planted and it is expected thatabout 210,000 hectares will be harvested. This is a small decrease in areacompared with 1979. The weather during the growing season has been variable.Assuming that harvesting and processing are not disrupted by bad weather, thecrop should yield about 1.1 million tonnes of white sugar. Contracting for1981 is not yet finished, but the area under sugar beet is not expected to changesubstantially.Horticulture (Tables 2, 5, 11 and 26)29. It is not possible to deal individually with the whole range of horticul-tural crops grown commercially in the United Kingdom. These paragraphsconcentrate on crops in significant production including those subject toCommunity arrangements (ie apples, pears, cauliflowers and tomatoes).30. The area devoted to horticulture has been declining for some time andthis trend continued in 1980 when about 268,000 hectares were used forhorticultural crops compared with 285,000 hectares in 1979.31. The production of dessert apples and pears in 1980 was considerablybelow the 1979 level when there was a good crop. The reasons were anindifferent growing season, which brought lower yields and an increasedproportion of smaller fruit of less good quality, and a. reduction in orchardarea. An increased yield of cooking apples more than compensated for areduction in area. Production of soft fruit was affected by the cold, late springand wet weather at picking time which affected both yield and the generalcondition of the fruit. Production of field vegetables varied according to crop,carrots being lower than in 1979 and cabbages and cauliflowers higher thanlast year.32. The 1979/80 over-wintered cauliflower crop survived fairly well, butquality, particularly in the early part of the season, was poor. Adverse growing6
conditions affected the early summer crop, but the autumn crop was aboutaverage in size and of good quality. Overall yields of cauliflowers, which varyfrom year to year mainly as a result of the weather, moved up in 1980 to the1978 level after a reduction in 1979.33. Growers of protected crops were able to economise on fuel and tomaintain growing conditions because the latter part of the winter and theearly spring in 1980 were milder than in 1979. But periods of dull weatherfrom June to September disrupted cropping patterns and reduced yields.Overall output was higher in 1980 than in 1979 and was achieved from aboutthe same area.. &lt;34. Prices of apples and pears were higher in 1980 than in 1979, but com-petition from imports of dessert apples has remained strong. Withdrawals ofapples in the United Kingdom, under Community arrangements, are expectedto be about the same as those in previous years (around 2% of the crop).Parts of the protected crop sector have suffered from very low returns. Thevalue of the lettuce crop was considerably lower than in 1979 and cut flowershave had a poor year. But tomato prices for the season as a whole were verymuch higher than the very low levels in 1979. In June and July prices weresimilar to 1979, but from late July onwards they rose. Wholesale prices forcauliflowers have on average been slightly higher than in 1979.Hops (Tables 2, 5, 12 and 26)35. The area under hops changed only slightly between 1979 and 1980 butproduction was slightly lower. Average prices in 1980 were, however, muchhigher.Seeds (Table 13)36. The area sown for certified herbage and legume seed production in1980 (excluding field bean and field pea seed) was about the same as in 1979,but production was down because the yield was lower. Imports in 1979/80were slightly higher than in 1978/79, but exports were over 25% higher. Stocksat the end of 1979/80 were very high, and prices to growers of most specieswere slightly down.37. The areas sown for certified field bean and field pea seed production in1980 increased by 75% and 400% respectively compared with 1979. Produc-tion far exceeds requirements for sowing and the surplus goes to export andother markets. The area and production of field pea seed are expected toincrease sharply again in 1981.Beef and Milk (Tables 2, 5,14,15,16 and 26)38. The 1980 June census showed a decline of about 2\% in the totalUnited Kingdom cattle breeding herd, compared with the previous year. Thedairy herd which was about two-thirds of all breeding cows showed a fallof 2%. The beef herd fell in 1980 by over 1\% and is expected to fall by asimilar percentage in 1981. In the Community price-fixing settlement for 1980a Suckler Cow subsidy worth  12.37 per eligible animal was introduced toassist beef producers.39. Home production of beef in 1980 is expected to be at about the samelevel as in 1979. With lower imports but increased exports, total supplies of7
beef for home consumption in 1980 may be some 4% below 1979 levels anda little further down in 1981. Average market prices for certified cattle in theUnited Kingdom were depressed for most of 1980, and slaughter premiumswere paid at the maximum rate from early July. Prices reached a peak of86.58p per live kg in early April but fell rapidly to a level of around 67pper live kg during October, before increasing seasonally towards Christmas.There was substantial intervention from early August which reached an averageof about 1,000 tonnes per week. This fell back to about 500 tonnes per weekafter intervention on forequarters was suspended in November.40. The average yield of milk per cow in 1980 is expected to show anincrease of some 2% compared with the level in 1979, but the average size ofthe national dairy herd over the year as a whole is expected to fall by 2%compared with 1979. Although milk production over the last few months ofthe year has been running below last year&apos;s level, production for the year as awhole is expected to show an increase of nearly \%, because production earlierin the year was substantially higher than in the corresponding period of theprevious year. The amount of milk sold for liquid consumption in 1980 isexpected to fall by 1|% compared with 1979. Together with the increase inproduction, this should lead to an increase of just over 2% in the availabilityof milk for manufacturing. Milk used for cheese production in 1980 is expectedto remain at about the same level as in 1979, but milk used for butter produc-tion is expected to increase by just over 4%.41. Producer returns for milk are determined by the Milk Marketing Boardson the basis of their returns from the liquid and manufacturing milk markets.It is expected that the Boards&apos; net returns from all milk for the 1980/81 yearwill be between 13.8 ppl and 14.0 ppl. Because of the termination of theSpecial Assistance to Northern Ireland milk producers, however, the netreturns to the Northern Ireland Board are expected to be between 12.2 ppl and12.4 ppl. These figures take account of the increase in the retail price of liquidmilk of l^p per pint which took effect on 4 January 1981.42. The average size of the national dairy herd in 1981 is expected todecline slightly; this means that any increase in milk production will dependupon further improvements in yields.Sheep and Wool (Tables 2, 14, 18 and 26)43. The breeding flock increased by 2% between June 1979 and June 1980,although the number of shearling ewes fell by 5%. The number of lambs underone year old rose by 8% after the fall in 1979; the increase reflected theexceptional lamb crop. The breeding flock may show a further small increasein 1981.44. United Kingdom home production of sheepmeat is expected to be about13% higher in 1980 than in 1979. Total supplies to the market are expected torise by about 4%, with imports declining by about 9% and exports by about5%. The Community regime for sheepmeat came into effect on 20 October1980. Its provisions included the possibility of introducing a variable premiumscheme on similar lines to the Fat Sheep Guarantee Scheme which previouslyoperated in the United Kingdom. The Variable Premium Scheme has beenadopted in the United Kingdom; it is fully Community-financed and providesa higher level of guarantee than the previous United Kingdom scheme which8
has now been discontinued. In 1980 prices were below the guaranteed price inJanuary and from March onwards, and below the guide level for variablepremiums from 20 October. On average, prices in 1980 were some 10% belowthe level in 1979 but increased guarantee payments ensured a considerablyhigher return to producers. Prices for lowland store lambs were variable, butprices for stores from the hills and hill ewes were generally higher than in 1979.45. The production of wool rose by about 6% in 1980. Despite the increasein the guaranteed price in May, the price paid to producers fell because therewas an increase in the deduction for the marketing costs of the British WoolMarketing Board. Market prices for the 1980 clip are expected on average tobe well below the guaranteed price, and Exchequer advances to the Board weremade from November 1980 as the stabilisation fund moved into deficit.Pigs (Tables 2, 14 and 26)46. Pigmeat production in 1980 is expected to be some 3% less than in 1979.It is likely to decline further in 1981. This reflectsthe decline in the numbersof breeding pigs which occurred during 1979 and continued into 1980. Littlechange in numbers is expected during 1981. The change from negative topositive monetary compensatory amounts, as a result of the devaluations ofthe green pound in 1979 and the strengthening of sterling, placed the industryin a stronger competitive position. Prices were fairly steady during 1980.Poultrymeat (Tables 2, 14 and 26)47. Output in 1980 is expected to be much the same as in 1979 and littlechange is expected in 1981. Overall average prices in 1980 were above the 1979levels, although prices fell in the latter part of 1980.Eggs (Tables 2, 5, 17 and 26)48. Output is expected to fall by around 5% in 1980 with some furtherdecline in 1981. Prices in 1980 were above 1979 levels.9
APPENDIXSTATISTICAL TABLESThe tables cover largely the same ground as those in last year&apos;s White Paper exceptthat:(a) the layout of the final part of Table 21 has been amended to show moreexplicitly the various incomes and associated payments comprised within netproduct. The total labour bill is now split between the component parts inrespect of hired workers and family workers (except spouses) and partners. Theestimate of farming income together with net rent (on tenanted land) corre-sponds to net income as defined in last year&apos;s White Paper, which was on awholly owner-occupied basis;(6) Table 22 (which was Table 19 in last year&apos;s White Paper) now shows farmingincome as defined in Table 21 and net income as defined in Table 19 of lastyear&apos;s White Paper, and no longer includes a 3-year moving average of netincome.Even where there has been no change in the presentation of the tables, some of thefigures in this appendix differ from those in previous Annual Review White Papersbecause of later information, changes in the scope and nature of available data andimprovements in statistical methods. The forecasts for 1980 generally reflect the positionup to the end of the year, as seen at November 1980.All figures relate to the United Kingdom, unless otherwise stated.Figures for imports from and exports to the Eight relate throughout to the othercountries of the European Community as it was constituted during 1980 (Belgium,Denmark. France, West Germany, the Irish Republic. Italy, Luxembourg and theNetherlands).Significant items of Channel Islands trade are shown separately in the tables.Figures for exports include re-exports.In some cases figures may not add up to the totals shown because of roundings.Symbols:  means &quot;nil&quot;... means &quot;negligible&quot; (less than half the last digit shown). . means &quot;not available&quot; or &quot;not applicable&quot;.11

Table I&apos;Jpontinued)(a) The coverage of holdings in this Table has been changed and now includes data in respect ofstatistically insignificant holdings in England and Wales.For all years (except 1969) the figures included for England and Wales relate to all known holdingsirrespective of their size or labour requirement (standard man-days). The figures for 1969 excludesome 2 000 holdings which had a significant output from I acre (0.4 ha) or less and which werefirst brought into the census in 1970. A standard man-day (smd) represents 8 hours&apos; productivework by an adult male worker under average conditions.For Scotland the figures included for 1969 cover all known agricultural holdings exceeding 1 acre(0.4 ha) in extent. In 1970 some 16 000 statistically insignificant holdings (holdings with less than 26smd) were excluded from the census and in 1973 when the threshold of significance was raised from26 to 40 smd a further 5 000 holdings were excluded. Since then the Scottish figures relate to allknown agricultural holdings with 40 smd or more.In Northern Ireland the introduction of the 40 smd concept in 1973, and the removal of the 1 acre(0.4 ha) threshold, resulted in the net elimination of some 6 000 holdings from the Northern Irelandcensus. From 1973, therefore, the figures include all known agricultural holdings with 40 smd ormore; holdings with less than 40 smd are excluded only if they have less than 10 acres (4 ha) ofcrops and grass and no regular whole-time worker. The figures before 1973 related to holdings of1 acre (0.4 ha) or more except for numbers of livestock which were collected from all ownersirrespective of the size of the holding as well as from landless stockholders.(b) Cereals for threshing, excluding maize.(c) Includes small area of soft fruit grown under orchard trees in England and Wales.(d) Hardy nursery stock, bulbs and flowers.(e) Most of the difference between total horticultural area and the sum of individual sectors is madeup by the glasshouse area.(j)   Includes area of other crops and bare fallow not shown in the table.(g)  Includes lucerne.(/i)  Before 1975 collected as:In England and Wales &quot;clover, sainfoin and temporary grasses&quot;;In Scotland  &quot;grass under 7 years old&quot;;In Northern Ireland    &quot;grass 1st, 2nd and 3rd year&quot;.(0   Before 1975 collected as:In England and Wales &quot;permanent grass&quot;;In Scotland  -&quot;grass 7 years old and over&quot;;In Northern Ireland    &quot;grass 4th year or older&quot;.0) Returns of &quot;other land&quot; were collected for the first time in England and Wales in June 1969. FromJune 1969 to June 1973 &quot;other land&quot; in Great Britain was collected as woodland and areas underroads, yards, buildings, etc., the use of which was ancillary to farming of the land; in NorthernIreland it included land within agricultural holdings which was under bog, water, roads, buildings,etc., and waste land not used for agriculture. In June 1974 the definition was changed in Englandand Wales to include all other land forming part of the holding and in Scotland it was extendedto include ponds and derelict land. The Northern Ireland definition is unchanged.15

The figures for 1975, however, have beenadjusted to take account of the recent reappraisal of very small (SI) holdings in England and Waleswhich resulted in a further 11 000 holdings being removed from the June 1980 census. The figuresfor 1975 and 1980 are therefore broadly comparable. The decline in the total number of holdings isreflected in the smallest farm or enterprise size group and has marginally increased the average sizeof some enterprises.Caution must be exercised in comparing these figures with those quoted in recent White Papers andin particular with figures in White Papers published prior to the 1978 Review when results werebased on imperial measurements and old standard man-day (smd) values.(6) The average size of holdings based on total area was:  1975 69.0 hectares of which 67.2% was under crops and grass.1980   72.0 hectares of which 67.9% was under crops and grass.(c) These figures include holdings with no crops and grass which are excluded from the first sectionof the Table.(d) Following the introduction of revised smd values for the 1978 Annual Review a lower size group of&quot;under 250 smd&quot; was applied throughout the United Kingdom. This change resulted in a generalshift of holdings into lower size groups and this movement is particularly marked in NorthernIreland as the following figures show:  Holdings in Northern Ireland June 1975 (&apos;000)Based on old smd values Based on new smd values50-  199 smd 16.0 50- 249 smd 20.0200- 599 smd 12.6 250- 499 smd 6.9600-1 199 smd 3.8 500- 999 smd 2.81 200 smd and over       1.2 1 000 smd and over 0.7Total 33.6 Total 30.4As a result of this change, the figures shown in this Table are only comparable with those in theWhite Papers for 1978, 1979 and 1980 (but see note (a) above).(e) Figures relate to England and Wales only.(j)   Figures included for Scotland and Northern Ireland relate to December censuses in 1974 and 1979.(g) Figures included for Northern Ireland relate to pig holdings which had fattening pigs only.(h) Figures for Scotland, and figures for Northern Ireland in 1980 only, include small numbers of othertable fowls.18

Because of changes in the Census categoriesin England and Wales in 1970 and 1972, numbers returned for earlier years are not available on thesame basis as those for the most recent years. Before 1977 the figures do not include the wives/husbands of farmers, partners and directors, even though the wives/husbands themselves may bepartners or directors. In 1977 wives/husbands of farmers, partners and directors were returnedseparately, but only if they were engaged in farm work.Figures include estimates for all very small holdings in England and Wales not surveyed in therespective June censuses (see footnote (a) to Table 2).(b) Figures relate to Great Britain only.(c) Includes seasonal or casual workers in Northern Ireland. See footnote (d).(d) Before 1975 seasonal or casual workers were not returned as a separate item in Northern Ireland,but were included with part-time workers.(e) The decrease in the number of regular whole-time and part-time female workers in 1977 is thoughtto be explained by the separate return, for the first time in England and Wales, of farmers&apos; wives, someof whom were probably returned previously as family workers.19

In addition, the series shown for Scotlandrefer to equipped farms only and exclude sales of unequipped land, whole estates, iand sold forafforestation and inter-family sales. There is a delay between the date on which a sale is agreed andthe date on which it is included in the series. The delay is thought to average about 6-9 months inEngland and Wales and about 3 months in Northern Ireland. The average prices shown in the tablefor each calendar year relate to sales included in the series for these countries in the years ending inthe following September and March respectively. The data for Scotland and Northern Ireland aresubject to retrospective revision.(6) The indices of average rents for England and Wales are based on an annual rent enquiry and forScotland on continuing field enquiries. Very little land is rented, except under the conacre system, inNorthern Ireland.(c) The figures for the most recent years are subject to revision as detailed below:Agricultural Land PricesScotland: figures for the most recent years are based on sales notified up to November 1980.Northern Ireland: figures for the most recent years are based on sales notified up to September 1980.Average RentsAll countries: 1980 figures are provisional.39

Table 24 (continued)(a) For an explanation of the new series see page 11 of the Annual Review of Agriculture 1980 Cmnd.7812. These figures are collected in Farm Management Surveys by Universities and AgriculturalColleges in Great Britain and the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland. They are averagesweighted by the census distribution of agricultural holdings by type of farming and size of business.More detailed figures for England will be published in &quot;Farm Incomes in England 1979-80&quot;, forScotland in &quot;Scottish Agricultural Economics 1981&quot;, for Northern Ireland in &quot;Farm Incomes andInvestment in Northern Ireland for 1979-80&quot; and for Wales in the &quot;Welsh Agricultural Statistics1979-80. Supplement&quot;. Net income is the return to the farmer and spouse for their manual andmanagerial labour and the return on tenant-type capital in crops, livestock, machinery, etc., butexcluding land and buildings. It is calculated before deduction of interest on any farming loans. Allfarms are treated as rented and an inputed rental value for owner-occupied land is charged as anexpense in the accounts. Stocks of crops and livestock on farms at the beginning and end of theaccounting year are valued at current market prices and net income includes stock appreciation exceptthat arising on breeding cattle, sheep and pigs. The accounts relate mainly to calendar years or yearsending 5 April and the average year-ending date is about mid-February.(b) Based on standard gross margins per unit of crop area and per head of livestock, measured in Euro-pean Size Units (ESU) with 1 ESU equalling 1 000 European units of account of standard gross marginsat average 1972-1974 values.  See Commission Decision 78/463/EEC.(c) Includes &quot;lowland cattle and sheep&quot; and &quot;lowland cropping, cattle and sheep&quot; farm types.(d) Almost all farm businesses in Northern Ireland are based on owner-occupied holdings. As rents cannotbe imputed with reference to tenanted farms, the rental charges entered for owned land and buildingshave been assessed in relation to estimated sale value. Where land was taken in conacre, the actualrents paid have been included. For these reasons the average net incomes per farm are not on thesame basis as those for Great Britain.(c) 4 to 15.9 ESU.Public expenditure under the common agricultural policy (CAP) and onnational grants and subsidies (a)April/March (financial) years_	1976/77	1977/78	1978/79	1979/80 (.b)	1980/81 (forecast)I Price guarantees  and production grants					(i)   Price guarantees (c)					Sheep ........

Table 25 (continued)(a) This table excludes expenditure which may benefit farmers but where the value to them is not shownby the expenditure (e.g. expenditure on animal disease and pest control or on research, advice andeducation). Expenditure on agriculture in Northern Ireland, borne on the Northern Ireland Consoli-dated Fund, is also excluded. It does, however, include some expenditure which benefits consumersand trade interests rather than producers (see note (/c)). The figures for years up to and including1978-79 represent actual expenditure recorded in the Appropriation Accounts. The figures for 1979-80are subject to confirmation and those for 1980-81 are the latest estimates of expenditure.(6) Expenditure in 1979-80 includes payments which were due in 1978-79 but were delayed by industrialaction.(c)  Excludes payments for milk which have been attributed to the food subsidies programme.{d) Payments in respect of wool and potatoes relate partly to the clip or crop of the year indicated andpartly to the clip or crop in the preceding year or years. The negative figures reflect the arrangementswith the British Wool Marketing Board, whereby deficiency payments made by the Exchequer arerepayable from surpluses (excess of market price over guaranteed price) up to the amount of debtowing by the Board to Ministers.(e)  Includes the Farm and Horticulture Development Scheme.(J)   Includes the Farm and Horticulture Capital Grant Schemes.ig) Farmers in special areas are also eligible for additional assistance under the Agriculture and Horticul-ture Development Scheme and the Agriculture and Horticulture Grant Scheme. The estimated benefitis shown separately in section III of the table.(/j) Includes grants in respect of investment on loan guarantees*, farm structure loans*, producer organ-isations*, horticultural improvements, small horticultural production businesses, farm business records,agricultural drainage*, special assistance to livestock producers, hops restructuring and milk pasteur-isation equipment*. (Provision for the schemes marked * was included in the 1980-81 SupplyEstimates.)0&quot;) Includes grants for improvement of hill land and livestock rearing land, rural roads, forage groups*,producers in the Scottish Islands*, crofting improvements*, hill cattle and sheep, and winter keep.(Provision for the schemes marked * was included in the 1980 81 Supply Estimates.)(k) The figures shown are total expenditure before allowing for receipts from EAGGF which are shownseparately at the foot of the table. The figures are made up of several elements and include refundsand levies on intra-Community trade, import and export refunds on third country trade, the beefpremium scheme, aid for private storage and animal feed, certain production subsidies and the netcost of commodities bought into intervention and subsequently sold. The figures also take account ofcertain receipts treated as negative expenditure, namely monetary compensatory amounts levied onintra-Community trade and the co-responsibility levy on milk producers. Some of the expenditurebenefits consumers and trade interests rather than producers. The figures for 1976-77 include thespecial import subsidy on sugar, those for 1977-78 onwards the EC butter subsidy, and those for1978-79 onwards the UK share of the EC school milk subsidy scheme.(7) Includes eggs, poultrymeat, fruit and vegetables, hops, herbage seeds, dehydrated fodder, peas andbeans, fisheries and flax. Also includes expenditure on products covered by the CAP but not producedto any significant extent in the United Kingdom (olive oil, rice, wine and hemp).43
