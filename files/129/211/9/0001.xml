VCONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(81) 926 January 1981NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE REORGANISATION:COMPENSATION TERMSMemorandum by the Lord President of the Councilbackground1. The National Health   Service (NHS) reorganisation has called for areview of the compensation terms for staff who are made redundant. Thisreview could have repercussions for other public sector groups.    And thereis a wider issue because there has been a special &quot;Crombie Code&quot; ofcompensation terms for public sector staff affected by statutory reorgan-isations.    This was agreed by the Trades Union Congress (TUC), who haveprotested strongly about our recent decision to abandon it.2. The outstanding issue - on which the Home and Social AffairsCommittee (H) failed to agree - is that of NHS redundancy payments forstaff aged 41-49.    The Secretary of State for Social Services wishes toimprove these to the levels which apply to New Towns&apos; staff (see annex).He regards this as essential in view of strong pressures from NHS staffinterests.    Failure to settle quickly could delay the NHS rundown andthe savings expected from it.REPRESENTATIONS FROM THE TUC3. The TUC are pressing for a simplified compensation schemeincorporating the basic Crombie provisions.    This is unacceptable.Bringing all public sector compensation terms into line with the best Crombiefeatures would increase compensation costs substantially and impose a heavyadministrative burden.    But having been refused central negotiations, theTUC certaiiily expect some flexibility in the negotiations of the terms forparticular services.    It can be argued that if we can show that flexibility inthe important NHS case we will enhance our chances of holding the line withthem.GENERAL POLICY CONSIDERATION4. The proposed improvement is unobjectionable in terms of generalcompensation policy.    Indeed, it seems very fair.    The Secretary of Statefor Employment does not fear repercussions for the private sector or forthe statutory scheme.1CONFIDENTIALCOPY NO8!CABINET
CONFIDENTIAL5. Tentative estimates indicated that the .&apos;mproved terms could applyto between 810 and 1,140 redundant staff in England and cost an extra  2.7 to 4 million (much .less in Wales and Scotland).    Health authorities would beinstructed to absorb any extra cost without risk to the net savings expectedfrom NHS reorganisation by 1985 ( 30 million a year at 1980 prices inEngland alone).    The extra cost for ongoing redundancies could be some^ 180, 000 a year in England.6. But concession for the NKS would risk repercussions elsewhere.In particular, local authorities rejected the New Towns terms in 1973 oncost grounds.    Applying such terms to the impending local governmentrundown in England could affect about 29, 500 of the redundant staff at anextra gross cost of  67 million.    The Secretary of State for the Environ-ment is strongly opposed to a concession for the NHS because this riskspressure on local government to reverse their earlier decision. TheChief Secretary to the Treasury has said that there can be no question ofmore money being made available to local authorities for this purpose.7. This could also affect the substantial rundown of the teacher forcewhere there is an additional need to improve quality.8. In Scotland a concession for the NHS is not regarded as creatingirresistible pressure to extend it to other services.    Wider applicationin England and Wales could alter this but the Secretary of State for Scotlanddoes not regard the financial consequences as critical.9. The above costings should to some extent be offset by savingsbecause better terms for those in their 40s should reduce the need for moreexpensive retirements amonst those in their 50s and increase management&apos;sdiscretion to keep the best staff.    And, of course, delay to any majorreorganisation because of negotiating difficulties about redundancy defersand erodes the savings they are designed to bring.CONCLUSIONS10. Since the H Committee discussion suggested it was not realistic todecide now to grant the concession to the NHS but refuse it everywhereelse, I invite colleagues to consider the following two options:a. to make no concession either to the NHS or other publicservices.b. to allow the concession for the NHS and consider proposedextensions strictly on merits and with regard to the financialimplications, perhaps even making it clear that no new money wouldbe provided for thafreacon alone,11. It was this second alternative which the majority of H Committeefavoured.SCivil Service Department26 January 19812CONFIDENTIAL
