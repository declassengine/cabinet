CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(81) 4COPY NO12 January 1981CABINETTHE REMUNERATION OF JUNIOR MINISTERS INTHE HOUSE OF LORDSMemorandum by the Lord President of the Council1. We agreed on 27 November (CC(80) 42nd Conclusions, Minute 7) whenwe discussed C(80) 71 that the remuneration of junior Ministers in the Houseof Lords should be increased by the payment of an allowance.   I was invitedto consider the practicalities and report back to Cabinet.2. I attach a note which shows existing levels of remuneration ofMinisters and other office holders.    It is clear from this that, because &lt;&gt;! theParliamentary salary and allowances available to Commons Ministers, thedisadvantage to which junior Ministers in the Lords is subject is very large.A Minister of State in the Commons can get up to  37, 592 a year (includingallowances);  in the Lords he can only get up to  18,284 or less than half,while Parliamentary Secretaries can only get  14, 384.    Commons Ministershave Parliamentary responsibilities, burdens and expenses which LordsMinisters do not have;  but this difference is out of all proportion and presentsfor many a cash-flow problem.3. It has been proposed that the additional payment should take, tlx- formof an allowance.    An allowance is usually regarded as either:a. a payment to reimburse specified expenses;   such apayment can be non-taxable if the expenses are necessarilyincurred in the course of employment;or     b. a supplement to a basic wage or salary in respect ofobligations accepted or duties discharged by some members of agroup but not others;   such a payment is taxable as part ofremuneration.4. The payment we have in mind for junior Ministers and office holdersin the House of Lords cannot be regarded as an allowance in the first sense.We cannot identify specified expenses incurred by them which should bereimbursed - certainly not on the scale required to meet the real need.    I cansee no possibility of finding a defensible basis for a tax-free allowance of thiskind.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5. One of the justifications for what we !\ ,\e in mind in th.it juniorMinisters in the House of Lords, unlike their counts rpa rt s in tin- House ofCommons (and unlike Cabinet Ministers in the Lords), work for otherDepartments than their own.    But the incidence of this work among thorn isvery uneven;  and this argument for an allowance does not apply to other officeholders who we think should also benefit from what we have in mind.6. The other main justification for paying junior Ministers and officeholders in the Lords more is that of recruitment and retention.     A number otLords Ministers have warned vis that &apos;hey are having financial problemsbecause of inadequate remuneration.7. We could treat the additional payment we have in mind an a separateelement in the remuneration of junior Ministers in the Lords, and call it anallowance, or a supplement if   we did not wish to stretch the definition ofallowance too far.     But that would invite questions about the precise natureand value of the special responsibilities and burdens to be rewarded, whenwhat we are thinking of is really a straight increase in remuneration onaccount of a variety of factors.     I believe that the most straightforward wayto achieve what we have in mind is to establish two different rates of pay forjunior Ministers, one for the Commons and one for the Lords.8. I propose that there should be no differentiation between  l.oidi; andCommons Ministers at Cabinet level.    Neither of the two main justificationsfor the proposed increase - the arguments of recruitment and retention, andthe fact that junior Ministers in the Lords work for other Departments thantheir own - apply to Cabinet Ministers in the Lords.     &apos;! his should help us tojustify and defend the increase we propose.9. I believe that we can readily defend and justify the increases which ipropose in this paper.    We can point to the disproportionate size of thedifferential between junior Ministers in the Commons and those in the Lords.We can use the arguments of recruitment and retention.    If it would help, wecould indicate that, when we come to adjust Ministerial salaries this year,the cost of the additional remuneration given to junior Ministers in the Lordswill be contained within the overall increase.10. I think that  3, 500 a year - about half the amount of Parliamentarysalary payable to Commons Ministers - is a reasonable amount for &apos;he-addition we have in mind.     If it is to be paid as an allowance or supplement,I recommend that it should be set at that figure.    If, aa I think prefer abb;, weset separate rates for junior Ministers in the Lords, I propose that the Lordsrates should be   19, 900 for a Minister of State (currently on  16,400) and  16, 000 for a Parliamentary Secretary (currently on  12,500).    Other rates -Lords Whips and office holders, including the Leader of the Opposition and theOpposition Chief Whip in the Lords - should be adjusted accordingly.ZCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL11. Whichever way we increase the renmnevation of Lords Ministers weshall require legislation.     The additional pressure on the legislativeprogramme could be minimised by including the legislative provisionsrequired in the same Bill .is the provisions tor Parliamentary pensions.That Bill is very nearly ready for introduction, but the preparation ofadditional clauses on the remuneration of junior Ministers in the Lords shouldnot take very long, and need only delay the Bill for a very short time. Theadditional clauses would make the Bill more controversial than it wouldotherwise be;  but I think that the balance of advantage, in terms of thelegislative programme, is in favour of a single Bill.   I should like also totake advantage of the opportunity to   remedy the existing lack of power to payMinisterial salary increases retrospectively.    I suggest, however, that, ifwe go for a single Bill, we should postpone for a later occasion the otherchanges in legislation on Ministerial salaries canvassed in my earlier paper(C(80) 71, paragraph 6).CONCLUSION12. I invite the Cabinet to agree that:i. the remuneration of junior Ministers in the Lords shouldbe increased by fixing different salary rates tor Lords andCommons Ministers;ii. the Lords rates should be  19,900 for a Minister of State,and  16,000 for a Parliamentary Secretary, and that rales forother junior Ministers and office holders in the Lords should beincreased by the same amount;iii. Cabinet Ministers in the Lords should not get an increase;iv. the planned Bill on Parliamentary Pensions should be usedas the vehicle for legislation on Lords Ministers&apos; remuneration;v. in that Bill power should be taken to permit Ministerialsalary increases to be paid retrospectively.SCivil Service Department12 January 1981CONFIDENTIAL
