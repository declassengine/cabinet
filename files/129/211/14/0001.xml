It represents tin-joint thinking of those Departments,,     This note is intended lo no! out somerelevant tacts in the context of the present dispute and (o give myrecommendations on the decisions we need to lake on Thursday.2,        Historically, for the be3t part oi half a centuxy. Civil Service paydetermination has been handled differently Iron, thai &lt;&gt;&apos; tin- other publicservices.     There is a Civil Service arbitration agreement which dates ba&lt; kto just after the first: World War:   and a pay research system - now outdated - and Pay Agreement which hive tlu-ir origins in tho middle fifties,3* As for the; dispute itself,   if there were any evidence ol the  k lionweakening, it might be right to lace it out.    But I see no signs at themoment that there is any erosion of the support for the action. Suchindications as there are show that attituden - given the low level of moralein the Service - tend to be hardening and the unions are certainly pullingout the people they want, in the a reas Ihey want.     The re ;i r   no good groundfor thinking that time is on our side,,4. The 1979 and 1980   (settlements restored Cavil Service pay levels tocompare favourably with the outside.     Other settlements in April-September 1980 were unfortunately high, but in this pay round the 7 per centoffered to the Civil Service is not markedly behind the average :;&lt;&gt; far olaround 9i per cent.     At all events we arc tied for this year by the6 per cent cash limit.5. We hctve to decide:a.       whether we wish to find an accommodation with the unions,orb.       to face tbem out.1SECRET
SECRET6. Either way, we need to establish what public stance theGovernment sho ild adopta    if we decide to seek an accommodation there isnothing to give on money.    So we are left with the questions ofla. a long tavm arrangement - butj M this &gt;.sould mot operateuntil 198 &lt;;b. ar rangomonts for t h    I&apos;lK,&apos;. settlement.7  As to the long term,   we have already told the unions that we wish |ofind a new,  ordered and agreed system of determining Civil .Set-vice pay.It would take into account comparisons with all  terms and eo id it Ions ofservice outside.     Such a system would include access to independentarbitration.    The group of officials (MISC 54) are coming up with proposalsfor the future which will give us a basis to get our own long, term thinkingst-aight but I doubt thai Lta findings will command sufficient confidencegenerally for it t&gt; loim a sufficiently authoritative basis lor a new system.I think therefore we need to look to a high-powered independent erquiry tofind a way through.    The conclusions of mnh an enquiry would not of coursebe binding on anyone,  but liny would carry authority.8. Now as to 1982.     This year with the imperatives ol cash tin its, wehad to deny the Civil Service all three features of their pay system: payresearch,   negotiations and arbitration.,      We won&apos;t have pay research I&apos;m1982 either and in my view the unions would be unlikely to call off theirindustrial action unless wo were to return to the other two legs id the paysystem, namely negotiation  ird arbitration,9. So, if we decide to seek to settle this dispute, I propose I hat, when thtime is right, our stance with the unions should be that:a. we stand fast on 7 per cent;b. we intend to &gt;et up an independent enquiry into the longerterm arrangements;c. for 1982 we cannot allow the present pay researcharrangomonta to run.     But we will agree to negotiate with tin mand should the need arise, go to arbitration.10. I cannot bu sure that this pa. kage will bring an end to the industrialaction but, if the unions don&apos;t go along, with it, it would give us a good bar..:,on which to appeal to moderate opinion in the &lt;;ivil Service.Civil Service Department7 April. 19812SECRET
SECRETCIVIL SERVICE PAY:    A POSSIBLE FORMULANote by OfficialsIntroductionAt the Prime Minister&apos;s request officials have considered apossible formula to end the present Civil Service pay dispute.A group has met under Civil Service Department chairmanship,with members from the Cabinet Office, Treasury and Department,of Employment.general2     The unions1 action is aimed both at securing more moneyatthis year and/getting further assurances about how CivilService pay will be settled in the future.    But establishinga new pay system for the longer term will take time and thenew arrangements are unlikely to be in place for the 1982settlement.    For the union leaders the major i3sue this yearis therefore to get a satisfactory understanding about theprocedures to be adopted for the 1982 settlement.We   have       concentrated in this report on identifying theoptions for 1982, although we have considered also what mightbe said about the longer term and (possibly) this year&apos;soffer.3     The following considerations need to be borne xi mind:-a     Commitment and non-commitment.The to_vich-etone for the unions will be how firm a commit-ment/Government can give about the basis of the 1982settlement.    Any formula which is not binding will arousedeep suspicions.    But if their support were weakening theymight be ready to consider a less firm commitment whichoffered them a *way out&apos;.SECRET
SECRETb Costs.Any assurances about 19-82 will imply some loss of Governmencontrol over the level of the settlement.   The implicationsfor cash limits, and the way in which the cost of thesettlement might be accommodated in public expenditureceilings overall, are discussed in paragraphs 16-17below.Options for 19824 The following options might offer the unions a basis forending the dispute.One-Year Linkage5 A linkage could be established with either a generalindicator of pay movements _or with the pay movements of aselected group of outside analogues.   The latter would requirespecial data collection arrangements, and could lead todispute over the selection of analogues.    A linkage to ageneral indicator would therefore be preferable - probablythe Department of Employment&apos;s monthly index of averageearnings, which covers both manual and non-manual workers.6 The advantages of linkage are that it would give the unionsa firm assurance that the present relative position of theCivil Service would be preserved.   From the Government&apos;s pointof view the outcome would not be wholly unpredictable. Andas the link would be restricted to a specified and recent12-month period there would be no question of a &apos;catching up&apos;.ofincrease from 1980-81 - (though neither/arguing Scott and jobsecurity).   However, the Government has generally discouragedsuch linkages, except for special groups such as the ArmedForces, Police and-if the Select Committee so recommends -MPs.   A similar linkage arrangement for the Civil Service,even for one year, could well be expected to lead to moregeneral pressures in the rest of the public services. Itwould also be a likely target for public criticism.2SECRET
SECKET7 We have considered whether a linkage arrangement couldbe offered in a way which was not fully binding on theGovernment.   A possible approach would be to indicate thatthe linkage figure would be the major basis of the settle-ment, but to reserve the Government&apos;s right to bring to thenegotiating frame other relevant factors such as cost andeconomic circumstances, the recruitment and retentionposition, pensions and job security. Bu a t^$s difficult to jgeNegotiations with Agreed Access to Arbitration ]gf^ile^union!.8 The Civil Service Arbitration Agreement gives each sidethe right of unilateral access to arbitration, failingagreement by negotiation.   The Government has occasionally(as this year) refused access on grounds of national policybut arbitration awards, once made, can only be set aside byresolution of both Houses of Parliament.   The Agreement isseparate from the Civil Service Pay Agreement, and unlessaccess is specifically withdrawn the normal provisions willapply in 1982.9 The Government could undertake to negotiate on the 1982settlement, and to go to arbitration on a joint basis ifagreement could not be reached.    It could ii theory reservethe right to override the award, but we cannot see that inpractice it could contemplate setting aside an award onceit had been made.   There would be no restrictions on theevidence admissible in either the negotiations or atarbitration.   Each side would be free to argue its case.The Government could cite factors such as cost and economiccircumstances, the recruitment and retention position, andpensions and job security.   The unions would no doubt argueon the basis of pay comparisons,    although the Governmentwould have to make clear that pending the review of CivilService pay arrangements there could be no question ofreleasing the pay research evidence*  Collected . this year,or of commissioning further pay research surveys.3SECRET
SECRET10 This approach would assure the unions an independentassessment of the evidence.    At the same time the range ofevidence which the Government could present might secure alower settlement than, say, a linkage arrangement; althoughthere would also be the risk of a higher award, includinga possible &apos;catching up&apos; increase from 1980-81.   A forwardcommitment to arbitration for the Civil Service in 1982would not conflict with the Government&apos;s policy ofdiscouraging unilateral access to arbitration in the publicservices generally, but it would make it much more difficult!for the Government to encourage other public service employesto refuse joint access at times of economic difficulty.11 The Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal (CSAT) hasan independent Chairman and two members from official andunion side panels respectively.    It has a good record ofresponsible awards, and could provide a vehicle for 1982.The alternative would be a specially constituted independentTribunal but that would involve setting aside the presentArbitration Agreement.Negotiation, but no prior agreement on access to arbitration12 Alternatively, the Government Could undertake to negotin 1982 but explicitly reserve the right to refuse accessto arbitration on grounds of national policy.    As ademonstration of good faith it would agree the main factorsrelevant to the negotiations,  including comparisons withoutside pay movements.13 This option would give the Government a reasonablemargin of flexibility in negotiation, with the ultimatepower of override.    The only advantages for the unionswould be that the process of negotiation would be ensuredwith the opportunities that afforded them to argue theircase both with the Government and more widely; plus thepossibility (which they would judge remote) of arbitration.4SECRET
SECRETAd hoc Recommendation14 A reference on the 1982 settlement could be made toan independent body.    If an independent inquiry wereestablished to review the longer term Civil Service payarrangements, it might be asked for an interim report for1982.    However this would delay the inquiry&apos;s substantivework, and in the difficult circumstances of 1982 could under-mine the confidence of one or other side in the inquiry.The alternatives would be to approach the Top SalariesReview Body (although there must be doubt whether they wouldbe prepared to undertake the task); or to appoint an ad hocbody.15 The reference could be for:-a     a firm recommendation   on a specific figure, with acommitment by the Government to implement the outcome.The advantage for the unions would be that the result wasin the hands of an independent third party.   And for theGovernment there would be advantage in using ad hocarrangements rather than the normal processes ofnegotiation and arbitration, in order to avoid settingany precedent for the future pay system;b     an &apos;advisory opinion&apos; rather than a firm ruling; withthe Government&apos;s right reserved to adjust the results asnecessary in the light of other factors.   The unionswould distrust the Government&apos;s lack of commitment. Butif the option were pursued and an &apos;advisory&apos; figurepublished (as it would have to be), there would be strongpressure on the Government to abide by it, and the like-lihood of widespread industrial action otherwise;c     a recommendation about procedures only.   A drawbackof this approach would be the unpredictable nature of the5SECRET
SECREToutcome.    It might leave the Government no flexibility(eg linkage); or it might produce only loose guidelines,which gave-the unions no guarantee of an agreed settleme:Costs16 If a binding formula is offered on the 1982 settlementit will be essential that cash provision in advance of theoutcome should be set as realistically as possible.    But theoutcome could still be higher.17 It would of course be necessary to make clear to theunions that in funding the extra cost of any higher settlemeii|the Government would have to seek offsetting savings, andthese could fall severely on manpower and other administratilexpenditure.   There will be some scope here to absorbmarginal extra cost if necessary, and it will have to beexploited as determinedly and fully as possible,^ But themargin to be covered will be unpredictable and/could bebeyond the Government&apos;s ability to absorb it in manpowersavings.   There might be need for fresh decisions in otherareas of expenditure to find adequate offsetting savings,if the additional costs wre rot to fall on taxation orborrowing.Other Options18        Apart from the options for the 1982 settlement, thereare also the questions of what might be said about thelonger term and, possibly, a token improvement in the 1981offer.19        On the longer term Ministers are due to decide inthe light of the MISC 54 report whether to proceed withtheir proposed review by direct negotiation with the unions,or by appointing an independent inquiry.    Any negotiationswill be prolonged and contentious, and it would not behelpful to begin them before the present dispute is settled.If, however, Ministers decided to commission an independentinquiry we would see value in having this card to play inthe current dispute.    It would be a strong indication of6
SECRETthe Government&apos;s good faith in seeking an agreed system forthe future.    And although the union leadership would stillwant assurances about the basis of the 1982 settlement, theycould find it more difficult to maintain the sympathy of themoderates, and of public opinion generally, for continuingtheir action once an inquiry had been announced.Conclusions20 The main options we have identified are:-1982(i) One-year linkage: probably to the monthlyindex of average earnings (paragraphs 5-7);(ii) negotiations with agreed access to arbitration(paragraphs 8-11);(iii) ad hoc-recommendation from an independent body(paragraphs 14-15);Longer Term(iv) announcement of an independent inquiry(paragraph 19) 21 The assurances which would be needed to bring thedispute to an end will depend on the unions&apos; strength atthe time any approach is made.   The official CSD&apos;s view is thatat this stage the unions* support show no signs of weakening,and the union leaders are not yet looking for a way out. Inthese circumstances, the official CSD&apos;s judgement is thatonly a commitment about the 1982 settlement would be effectivein bringing an early end to the dispute.   The unions wouldprobably accept most readily an offer of negotiations backed bybinding arbitration, or a one-year linkage.    An ad hoc, binding,recommendation would be less attractive to them but theywould probably accept it if necessary.   However, if support7SECRET
SECRETfor the action were weakening it might be possible tosettle for a less binding commitment on 1982, such asthe offer of negotiation in good faith, with thepossibility but no guarantee of arbitration. Anannouncement of an independent inquiry for the longerterm could have a considerable impact on moderateopinion and could at the right moment be an importantelement in a peace formula.8SECRET
