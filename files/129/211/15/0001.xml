CONFIDENTIAL vjU^DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(81) 15 COPY NO 3613 April 1981CABINETCIVIL SERVICE PAY DISPUTEMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theLord President of the Council1. The Cabinet on 9 April (CC(8l) 15th Conclusions, Minute 4} invited usto map out a course in accordance with which a dialogue could be opened withthe unions, leading to a settlement of the present dispute.2. There ai e several elements in this:a. Colleagues showed no disposition to increase the present 7 percent offer.b. The unions need to be assured of our good faith in seeking towork out With them an ordered and agreed system for the longerterm;   we have not yet decided whether these discussions should be onthe basis of work by a new independent inquiry.c. For 1982, in the event of the longer-term arrangements notbeing in place by then, we shall need, as a minimum, to assure theunions of our good faith in a genuine negotiation.3. The remainder of this memorandum concentrates on the approach tothe 1982 pay settlement, discussing the elements on which we shall need toclear our minds before entering a dialogue with the unions.    Inevitably thismeans anticipating some of what we shall later be discussing in the context ofthe longer-term system;  it is important that, in setting a framework for1982, we do not sacrifice any of our longer-term aims which we shall need to -consider.    However, we should decide whether or not wa are to offer aninquiry for the longer term.FINANCIAL DISCIPLINE4. The unions will seek an assurance that the outcome fur 1982 is notonce again to be predetermined by inflexible cash limits set, on a basis theyregard as unrelated to relevant factors, in advance of negotiations.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5. There are vm.ivoid.iM-- dilemmas here.     Cash limits are an essentialelement in the financial discipline necessary lot- the control ot ex| . nditui-cduring the period for which they are Bet and, less directly, to constrain thecost of pay settlements across the. board, not only in the Civil Servii e. Wemust not create a regime for the settling of Civil .Service pay which, if appliedto other pay settlement,  within the public service, would prejudice  the contr Iwe are with difficulty establishing.    The Civil Service regime need not be thesame as others but it would not be defensible for it to appear to apply lessstringently.     We can try to introduce some elements of flexibility into thesettlement of cash limits in relation to pay (as opposed to their sub icquenlapplication), intended to provider, pay negotiating margin that would hesufficient at least for normal circumstances.     It .should he possible to deal atleast with 1982 on this basis.     But the amounts Involved, and some of theimplications, reed careful consideration.6. The essence of the financial arrangements could build on the followingfeatures:-a. Initial cash figuresWe will be taking our decisions on public expenditure for the comingyear, in cash terms, around November, and announcing our decisionon the Rate Support Grant immediately thereafter.    We have to take aview on pay and inflation generally as part of these de&lt; isions. Theannouncement for local authorities and the preparation of Estimatesmean that the assumptions to be made about increases in costs,specifically including costs of pay, will become public aroundDecember.    We should make it clear that cash plans at that stage werestill, at least to a limited extent, provisional.     Nevertheless there isan obvious risk that the chosen figure (or figures) will tend to sot afloor for subsequent negotiation, which must argue for deliberatelychoosing a figure lower than our central judgment ol the likely outcomeof negotiation.     The necessary (though limited) additional room formanoeuvre would be provided as described in the following sub-paragraphs.b. Flexibility with announced initial figuresRecent experience indicates that, for a particular year, prompt ,mddetermined action should be able to achieve a small percentagereduction in manpower, administrative and other costs to offset ah&apos;.gher than expected pay settlement.     Such a device could not beadopted and carried forward cumulatively over several yearn, but thiscould be prevented where pressure was developing intolerably byreconsidering the basic provision in second and subsequent, ye.irs.The case for flexibility of this kind also suggests that,  while we shouldcertainly hold to our medium-term target for redu&lt; tion of CivilService numbers, we should not bind ourselves at the outset to tooprecise a year-to-year path.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALc. Changes in structure of votesThere may be some scope for increasing the flexibility available withincash plans by changing the structure of Votes, for example to reducethe number of Votes composed wholly or mainly of payd. Contingency ReserveIt would also be sensible to provide for some additional money to beavailable if it becomes essential as a result of negotiation to makesome modest upward adjustment.     This would have t&lt;&gt; C0R16 from theContingency Referve, of which it might be possible to earmark somemodest proportion for this purpose.    There need be no increase Lntotal public expenditure,  since the provisional cash limits would havebeen set below the amounts intended by Ministers,    Our decision onthe total size of the Contingency Reserve need not be revealed untilBudget Day, and the extent to which it might provide for additional paycosts would rot be made public at all.     Use of the Contingency Res irvoin this way should in principle be available in respect of the pay ofother sU.ff employed by central Government (essentially the ArmedForces and the National Health Service):   the Armed Forces arealready provided for in this way.7. These arrangements would raise some questions of Parliamentarycontrol which would need discussion in due course with the Public AccountBCommittee (PAC) etc.     They arc suggested initially for 198?.. DiscuoHionwith the PAC etc ought not to be necessary until after the 19H/. settlement,when it could be handled in the light of the possibility of maintaining tinarrangements in subsequent years.     They should &apos;n normal circumstancesprovide a sufficient margin of flexibility to reach a settlement,  building on thefigures decided in November.     If a settlement could not be rea&lt; bed withinthese flexible limits, it would mean the outlook on pay had deteriorated in away that was quite unforeseen in November.    In circumstances of that kindthe Government would in any case be obliged to reconsider the wind,  of itspublic expenditure and budgetary plans, including the provision for payincreases.NEGOTIATING BRIEF8. The foregoing discussion of the financial framework is of course forourselves and not for exposition to the unions.     It would, however,  we hope,enable us to say with honesty that there could be genuine negotiations relatingto 1982 when the time comes.     Ideally that is all we should say - outside theCivil Service, no other negotiations would normally hedge around theconditions for future settlements.     We know, however, that we shall bepressed further.     We shall have to establish, in dialogue with the unions, whatare points which they think it most important tc clarify now and how far wecan meet them - on some it may not be possible to meet them at all.    It is3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALalso important that the discussions be. conducted in such a way that theGovernment cannot be accused of bad faith when it seeks to introdiu e its ownfactors in the discussion of the 1982 settlement.     It may thei efore benecessary to make public that these points are on the record.9. In the light of this, a note will bo circulated ai Cabinet identifying &gt;number of factors which we shall need to retain freedom to introduce into the1982 negotiations and setting them out in a form which, depending on ourdecisions, might constitute a negotiating brief.    Some points still for decisionby Ministers are indicated by square brackets in the note.10. Some information relating to pay outside the Civil .Service will be aninevitable element in the negotiations.     But it will be essential to avoidcreating any expectation: -i. that the embargoed Pay Research Unit information will bereleased or the established Pay Research machinery reactivated for1982; orii. the t any fact-gathering arrangements which might be agreed aspart of a &apos;onger-term system would be in place in time to be the basisof a 1982 settlement.ARBITRATION11. Arbitration is one of the questions which will need to be considered.The note to be circulated separately deals with this but the factual backgroundis as follows.     The Civil Service Arbitration Agreement still stands.Formally it provides a &apos;unilateral right of accers to arbitration althoughGovernment have asserted (and sometimes exorcised) a right to refuse accesson grounds of policy.     If nothing is said in the dialogue with the unions, theGovernment could be accused of bad faith if it did not allow arbitration totake place in 1982.     It would in any case be difficult for the Government to saynothing,  since the unions will seek assurances.12. The Treasury Circular of 1925 which announced the ArbitrationAgreement contained the pledge that &quot;subject to the overriding authority ofParliament the Government will give effect to the awards&quot;.     This has alwaysbeen understood to mean that the Government would not itself propose non-implementation.     Any agreement now to go to arbitration would thereforeimply agreement to implement the award unless a statement were made lomodify the 192 5 declaration.CONCLUSION13. Our aim must be to leave 1982 as open as possible and to avoidcompromising either the future system or other public service paynegotiations in 1982.     The separate note,  subject to discussion of its details,4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALprovides a possible agenda for exploration in dialogue with the unions.     In thelast resort, however, it may not be possible to reach agreement with them intheir present mood and there may be no alternative to continuing wi*.h thedispute until the mood changes.     In that case we may need to reconsider Ourwillingness to retain 1 April as the operative date for a settlement.G HSTreasury Chambers13 April 19815CONFIDENTIAL
