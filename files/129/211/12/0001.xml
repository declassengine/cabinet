_ICommission to enter into urgent discussion with the United States on therange of problems facing the textiles and chemical industries of theCommunity as a result of increased imports from the United States.1.9 The Community has continued to develop its role in the internationaldiscussion of world energy problems. In particular Member States agreeda number of measures to help prevent tension on the oil markets as aresult of the war between Iran and Iraq. Progress has also been made on anumber of issues central to a Community energy policy, including thereduction of dependence on imported oil.1.10 The Government have continued to work for Community policiesmore directly benefiting individual citizens, including for example, theliberalisation of the present tightly regulated air transport system in Europe,reciprocal health and social security benefits, and the mutual recognition ofprofessional qualifications.SECTION II: POLITICAL CO-OPERATIONMiddle East2.1 Following the Venice Declaration by the European Council on12-13 June, M. Thorn as President of the Council of Ministers undertooka round of visits to the Middle East and met leaders of the parties concerned.The European Council on 1-2 December considered the results of thesevisits and further work done in the Nine on the principal issues withdrawal,self-determination, security in the Middle East, and Jerusalem on whichthere would have to be progress if a comprehensive settlement were to beachieved. The European Council decided that the Nine should maintainclose contact with the parties concerned, in order to explore more thoroughlypossible ways of securing agreement on these issues and to encourage aclimate more favourable to negotiation.Iran/Iraq2.2 The Nine kept in close touch about the conflict between Iran andIraq. In New York on 23 September the Foreign Ministers of the Ninestated their concern at the implications of the war, and their support for anyinternational initiative likely to promote a peaceful settlement.Iran2.3 Community Ambassadors in Tehran remained in close consultation.The Nine continued to oppose strongly the detention of the Americanhostages and the flagrant breach of international law which this represented.Sanctions were in force throughout the period.Euro-Arab Dialogue2.4 A meeting between representatives of the Nine and the ArabLeague was held in Luxembourg on  12-13 November, marking the6
resumption of the Euro-Arab Dialogue. It was agreed in principle that ameeting of Foreign Ministers of both sides should be held next summerand that the relevant working parties on economic, financial and culturalco-operation should be reconvened as soon as possible.Afghanistan2.5 The Nine continued to make clear their condemnation of Sovietintervention and have joined the majority of the international community incondemning at the United Nations the continued Soviet occupation ofAfghanistan.Poland2.6 The Nine followed with concern the increasing tension in Poland.At the European Council on 1-2 December they expressed their sympathyfor Poland and recalled that all the States participating in the Final Actof the Helsinki Conference had agreed to respect the right of each countryto choose and develop its own social system without external interference.They urged all signatory states to abide by these principles in their relationswith Poland and emphasised that any other attitude would have very seriousconsequences for the future of international relations in Europe and through-out the world.The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)2.7 In preparing for the Madrid CSCE meeting, the Nine co-ordinatedboth their tactics and their objectives. They continued to work closelytogether at Madrid both in the preparatory meeting and in phase one of themeeting itself, which was completed at the end of the year. The Nine alsoestablished close working contacts with other delegations within the broaderWestern caucus and with neutral and non-aligned countries. The cohesionof the Western delegations was a major factor both in thwarting attemptsby the Soviet Union to prevent a proper review of implementation, and inensuring that the review of implementation itself was frank and thorough,but without polemics.Terrorism2.8 As part of the Community&apos;s programme for co-operation againstterrorism, senior officials met in Luxembourg in December to considerreports from Working Groups.Machinery of Political Co-operation2.9 The dramatic events of the past year and the unstable worldsituation have underlined the importance of Community co-ordination onforeign policy questions. Foreign Ministers therefore decided to examineways of improving the functioning of Political Co-operation. They haveasked their senior officials to prepare a report on the different possibilities.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary has himself put forward a numberof suggestions for a strengthened political commitment, an improvedemergency procedure and a small support staff.713121 c*
SECTION III: ENLARGEMENT, EXTERNAL RELATIONS,TRADE AND AIDEnlargement3.1 The Community completed the arrangements necessary for Greekaccession as the tenth member of the Community on 1 January 1981.Negotiations for the accession of Portugal and Spain continued: papershave now been exchanged on most aspects of enlargement. The Communityagreed on a package of pre-accession aid for Portugal of 275 millionEuropean units of account (MEUA) (about  154 million)(1) consisting of125 MEUA (about  70 million)C) of budgetary aid and 150 MEUA (about 84 millionX1) of loans from the European Investment Bank.Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP)3.2 On 16 December the Foreign Affairs Council adopted revised GSParrangements for developing countries. Like its predecessor, the new Schemewill run for 10 years; it will be subject to annual reviews, and to an in-depthexamination after five years. The main changes to the arrangements came inthe treatment of industrial products, where the Community sought to simplifythe Scheme and to concentrate its benefits on the poorer and less competitivesupplying countries who have real need of tariff preferences. The numberof product categories was cut from four to two &quot; sensitive &quot; and &quot; non-sensitive &quot;, covering respectively 128 and over 1,700 items. For &quot; sensitive &quot;products, global limits on the volume of preference available to the aggregateof all beneficiaries were replaced by limits applying to each beneficiaryindividually. The Newly Industrialising Countries, who hitherto pre-emptedthe lion&apos;s share of the benefits, were put under strictly controlled &quot; tariffquotas &quot;, often at levels below those they managed to secure under the oldsystem, for product lines in which they are now demonstrably competitive.The poorer and less competitive suppliers, on the other hand, were eachplaced under more generous and less tightly controlled &quot; tariff ceilings&quot;,which will in all cases allow them an increase in their preferentialopportunities.Textiles3.3 Under the terms of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement bilateral agree-ments with low-cost supplying countries, a further sixteen new quotas ontextile and clothing products were introduced since 1 July. The VoluntaryRestraint Arrangement with Cyprus was extended to cover 1981.Synthetic Textiles3.4 During 1980 the sharp rise in United Kingdom imports of polyesterfilament yarn and nylon carpet yarn from the United States was controlledby the imposition of quotas by the Commission. The quotas on these rawmaterials created certain problems for users in the United Kingdom, how-ever, and the subsequent imposition of anti-dumping duties on some halfof United States imports of polyester yarn reduced the need for the quotas.At the Foreign Affairs Council on 16 December the United Kingdom didnot seek the renewal of the quotas but proposed that the Community should0) Converted at the December market rate of 1 -78 eua =  18
enter into urgent discussions with the United States Administration on thewhole range of problems caused by increasing imports of both textiles andcertain chemicals. These discussions should cover, in particular, the advan-tages enjoyed by United States industry because of controls on the priceof oil and natural gas. The Council agreed that developments necessitated anew and strong initiative and invited the Commission to pursue discussionsurgently with the Americans and to report back as soon as possible, with afirst report in February 1981.Japan3.5 Japan&apos;s balance of payments surplus with the Community continuedto increase, causing major concern within the Community. After its meetingon 25 November the Foreign Affairs Council released a statement abouttrade relations with Japan. It pointed out the need for a wide-rangingdialogue between the Community and Japan on the basis of a commonstrategy. In particular, the need for effective moderation of Japanese exportsin certain sectors was stressed as well as the need for a clear commitment onthe part of the Japanese Government to a substantial and early increase inimports from the Community.Cyprus3.6 A meeting of the EC/Cyprus Association Council was held on24 November. The Cypriot delegation, led by the Foreign MinisterMr. Rolandis, accepted proposals from the Community for moving towardsthe second stage of association, as provided for in the EC/CyprusAssociation Agreement of 1972. The existing temporary trade regime wasextended for one year until 31 December 1981 when new and improvedarrangements, to be negotiated in 1981, will come into force for 1982and 1983, with arrangements thereafter to be negotiated from 1 January1982.Tunisia3.7 The EC/Tunisia Co-operation Council met on 15 December, totake stock of the application of the EC/Tunisia Co-operation Agreement.The Tunisian delegation also stressed their concern at the possible effectsof enlargement of the Community on their exports to it of agriculturalproduce, especially olive oil. The Community undertook to try to takeaccount of the particular preoccupations of all Southern Mediterraneancountries including Tunisia, in its examination of the consequences of thefurther enlargement of the Community for third countries.Israel3.8 A meeting of the EC/Israel Co-operation Council was held atMinisterial level on 7 October to review implementation of the Co-operationAgreement. The Israeli delegation, led by the Foreign Minister, Mr. Shamir,also stressed Israel&apos;s concern that enlargement of the Community wouldhave an adverse effect on her exports of agricultural produce to theCommunity.   The Community undertook that it would endeavour to take913121 c*2
the special concerns of Mediterranean countries, including Israel, intoconsideration in its examination of the implications for third countries ofthe further enlargement of the Community.Poland3.9 The Foreign Affairs Council decided on 16 December to makeCommunity foodstuffs, in particular barley, beef and butter, available toPoland at favourable prices.Romania3.10 The Industrial Products Agreement (IPA) and Joint CommitteeAgreement (JCA) between the Community and Romania were signed inBucharest on 29 July, to come into force on 1 January 1981. The IPAis intended to develop trade and economic relations between the Communityand Romania and recognises the importance of industrial products in theexpansion of trade. The JCA establishes a Joint Committee which willmeet, normally annually, to monitor and discuss the development of trade.Zimbabwe Accession to the Second Lome Convention3.11 An agreement between the Community and Zimbabwe on the termsof her accession to the Second Lome Convention was signed in Luxembourgon 4 November and will come into force when the ratification proceduresare completed. Under the Agreement Zimbabwe will benefit from all theprovisions of the Convention, ie duty-free access to the Community marketfor all her industrial and most of her agricultural products, subject only tothe safeguard provisions of the Convention. She will be entitled to sendup to 8,100 tonnes of beef under these arrangements and export 25,000tonnes of sugar to the Community annually from 1 July 1982 at the latest.In addition the European Development Fund will be increased by 85MEUA (about  47   7 million)(1) to take account of Zimbabwe&apos;s accession.3.12 Up to 31 December Zimbabwe enjoyed the same preferential tradetreatment as that extended to the dependent territories of Member States.In order to prevent a hiatus in this access, pending entry into force of theAccession Agreement, an Interim Agreement, under which Zimbabwe willbenefit from all the trade provisions of the Second Lome Convention, wassigned in Luxembourg on 4 November to come into force on 1 January1981.Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)3.13 The first meeting of the EC/ASEAN Joint Co-operation Committeewas held in Manila on 28 and 29 November. Agreement was reached on ajoint working party to discuss trade questions on a continuing basis inBrussels.Agricultural Exports to the USSR3.14 The Foreign Affairs Council Decision of 15 January not to replacethose agricultural products denied to the USSR by the United States embargo,C) Converted at the December market rate of 1 -78 eua =  110
while allowing &quot; traditional levels of trade &quot; to continue, remained in forceand continued to be implemented by the Commission.Infra-Community Trade the Role of Standards and CertificationProcedures3.15 The Working Group on certification problems, under UnitedKingdom chairmanship, reported to the Directors General for Industry on 17October. The report recommended that pressing problems affecting onlytwo or three Member States should be dealt with initially on a bilateral ortrilateral basis. To facilitate this a contact point should be established ineach Member State. The Directors General endorsed these recommendations.The United Kingdom has given the Commission details of its own contactpoint, and United Kingdom trade associations have been invited to submitdetails of difficulties to be raised with the Member States concerned.Aid to Non-Associated Developing Countries3.16 On 18 November, the Development Council agreed a programmefor 1980 totalling 138-5 MEUA (about  77-8 million)0 and covering 15countries and 9 agencies.  Guidelines for 1981 were also agreed.Food Aid3.17 The November Development Council also agreed Resolutions onprovision for multi-annual planning of food aid and on policies to bepursued by the Community in dealing with hunger in the world, in the lightof a European Parliament Resolution on this subject adopted in September.Discussion continued on a food aid management regulation and on diversi-fication of food aid products.SECTION IV: AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIESEuropean Commission Paper: &quot; Reflections on the CommonAgricultural Policy&quot;4.1 On 11 December the Commission submitted to the Council a paperentitled &quot; Reflections on the Common Agricultural Policy&quot;. The papersets out three possible changes in the operation of the Common AgriculturalPolicy, the most important of which is the introduction of the principle ofproducer co-responsibility. The paper illustrates how this principle mightbe applied; for example by the introduction of a supplementary levy formilk, a levy or relative price reduction for cereals, a weakening of inter-vention for beef and a ceiling on expenditure on olive oil and the fruit andvegetable processing aid. In addition the Commission argue that theCommunity should adopt a more dynamic policy on agricultural exports andcontrol more closely imports of some feedingstuffs; and that, in structuralpolicy, greater emphasis should be laid on integrated regional policydevelopment programmes.(&apos;) Converted at the December market rate of 1   78 eua11=  1.
New Zealand Butter4.2 It was not possible to reach agreement in negotiations onCommission proposals for continuing access under special terms for NewZealand butter as from 1 January 1981. In December the Council agreedto extend the current arrangements in respect of 7,920 tonnes (one-twelfthof the 1980 entitlement) of New Zealand butter up to 31 January 1981 toprovide time for further discussions.Mutton and Lamb4.3 On 30 September the Agriculture Council resolved the major out-standing issues concerning the new regime for sheepmeat and goatmeat andagreed to its introduction on 20 October. The import arrangements arebased on voluntary restraint agreements under which countries supplyingthe Community will keep their sendings to within levels slightly above thosein recent years in return for a halving of the tariff to 10 per cent. Theinternal support system consists of producer income guarantees providedthrough annual premiums payable when the market price over the year fallsbelow a reference level, together with the option for Member States tooperate either limited intervention or a variable premium on animals soldfor slaughter. The variable premium represents a continuation of theUnited Kingdom&apos;s traditional deficiency payments system but with recoveryof premium on exports so as to prevent subsidised meat undermining themarket in other Member States and thus causing intervention.4.4 The United Kingdom is the major producer and consumer of sheep-meat in the Community and will be the main beneficiary. Variablepremiums and annual premiums fully financed by the EAGGF providedimproved support for our producers while ensuring adequate supplies ofmutton and lamb for consumers at prices not artificially increased byintervention.Potatoes4.5 Discussions continued on the Commission&apos;s proposals for a commonmarket organisation for potatoes.Sugar and Isoglucose4.6 In July the Commission asked the Council for a mandate to com-mence formal negotiations for Community accession to the InternationalSugar Agreement and this was examined at technical level. Revisedproposals for a new regime for sugar and isoglucose were presented by theCommission in September and were still under discussion at the end ofthe year.Production Refunds on Cereals used in Exported Whisky4.7 Discussions began on a Commission proposal to implement theDecision by the Agriculture Council of 30 May to make arrangements forpayment of refunds in respect of Community cereals used in the productionof exported whisky.12
Structural Measures4.8 Following the agreement in principle at the 1980-81 price-fixingsettlement, the Commission put forward formal proposals to restrict aid toinvestment in dairying and pig production. They also made proposals forthe development of agriculture in the French Overseas Departments andrural infrastructure in certain less favoured areas of the Federal Republicof Germany. All these proposals, together with some others on agriculturalstructures including one for the Western Isles of Scotland and two forNorthern Ireland which had been submitted previously by the Commission,were discussed but no decisions were taken by the Council.European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF)4.9 United Kingdom receipts from the Guidance section of the EAGGFamounted to  7-5 million in the last six months of 1980 and included 5-9 million for individual projects under Regulation 17/64 and projectsunder Regulation 355/77 on marketing and processing. This brought totalUnited Kingdom receipts from the Guidance section during 1980 to  40-5million, mainly in respect of claims relating to 1979. United Kingdomreceipts from the Guarantee Section of the EAGGF for the second half of1980 were  298-2 million, the total for the year was  505-7 million.Animal Health and Welfare4.10 The Agriculture Council on 11 November adopted a number ofmeasures for dealing with swine fever. The main provisions included:extending until 30 June 1981 earlier derogations granted to the UnitedKingdom, so that national controls for swine fever continue to be appliedto imports of pigs and fresh pigmeat from other Member States; newdetailed rules to apply from July 1981 to December 1985 permitting importsonly under stringent conditions; and providing financial assistance forMember States to undertake accelerated swine fever eradication campaignsduring the next five years. The measures are complementary to Directive80/217, introducing Community measures for control of classical swinefever, which is due to be implemented on 1 July 1981. The combined effectof these measures is to protect fully the high health standards of the nationalpig herd.4.11 A Directive to prevent the spread of Enzootic Bovine Leucosisthrough intra-Community trade in live animals was also adopted at theNovember Agriculture Council. This enabled Member States to applyfrom January 1981 more stringent import rules than previously and willgive a good level of protection to the United Kingdom.4.12 The problem of hormone residues in veal was raised at theSeptember Agriculture Council and a Commission proposal for a regulationon the use of substances with a hormonal or thyrostatic action in domesticanimals was received at the November Council. The matter was still underexamination at the end of the year.4.13 Discussion of the Commission&apos;s proposals for developing theexisting safeguards to protect the welfare of animals during internationaltransport continued.    On 22 July the Agriculture Council adopted a13
Resolution which agreed that egg-laying hens kept in cages must be subjectto minimum welfare standards. The Resolution invited the Commission tosubmit proposals, which would take the economic factors into account, by1 July 1981 and agreed that appropriate measures would be adopted by theCouncil before November 1981. The Commission was also invited tosubmit in good time a report on systems of egg production.FisheriesInternal Regime4.14 On 21 July the Fisheries Council extended the interim Decisionon internal fishing arrangements to 31 October and this was further extendedto 20 December at the October Council.4.15 On 29 September the Fisheries Council reached agreement on aconservation regime which was to form part of an overall settlement. Thisagreement was enshrined in Council Regulation 2527/80 of 30 September.Pending agreement of the other elements of the Common Fisheries Policy(CFP) this Regulation was to expire on 20 December. However, theFisheries Council on 17 December decided to extend, until 31 January 1981,its period of application.4.16 The 28 October Fisheries Council agreed in principle a draftcontrol regulation which establishes that each Member State is responsiblefor enforcement of Community fisheries Regulations within its ports andfishery limits and requires the Commission to ensure that Member Statesfulfil their obligations. The regulation prescribes certain basic rules tobe observed by Community fishermen and also the broad principles to befollowed by the enforcement agencies of Member States. The Governmentwelcomed this regulation as being necessary to ensure uniformity ofenforcement throughout the Community. Largely at the prompting of theUnited Kingdom the Commission put forward proposals in December toestablish a special unit with the specific task of ensuring that Member Statescarried out their enforcement responsibilities in a consistent and uniformmanner. The Fisheries Council could not however reach full agreementon the CFP in order that it could be put into effect by 1 January 1981.External Regime4.17 On 21 July the Fisheries Council agreed arrangements to allowIceland and Norway to fish in the new East Greenland fisheries zone.4.18 Following a decision taken at the November Fisheries Council theframework agreement between the Community and Spain was ratified laterthat month.14
SECTION V: ECONOMIC, MONETARY AND BUDGETARYQUESTIONSEconomic and Monetary Co-operationThe European Monetary System5.1 The European Council on 1 and 2 December reviewed the operationof the European Monetary System and decided that further development,including the creation of a European Monetary Fund, should be under-taken at an appropriate time.Finance Council Business5.2 Finance Ministers continued their regular reviews of the economicsituation in the Community. At its 15 July meeting the Council releaseda further tranche of 400 MEUA (about  225 million)(I) under the NewCommunity Instrument for lending to investment projects in Member States.The final tranche of 100 MEUA (about  56 millionX1) was released at the20 October Council meeting.5.3 At its 17 November meeting the Council considered a proposal fromthe Commission for amending the Community Loan Mechanism; theMechanism allows the Community to borrow funds for onlending to MemberStates in balance of payments difficulties caused by oil price increases. On15 December the Council adopted the Commission&apos;s Annual EconomicReport for 1980 including guidelines for economic policy in 1981.Financial Mechanism and Supplementary Measures5.4 The period under review saw the establishment of the machineryneeded to give effect to the reductions in the United Kingdom&apos;s net con-tribution to the Community budget for 1980 and 1981 agreed at the ForeignAffairs Council on 30 May 1980. The two Regulations concerned (2743/80amending the Financial Mechanism and 2744/80 establishing supplementarymeasures in favour of the United Kingdom) were adopted by the FiscalCouncil on 27 October.5.5 In December the Commission took its first decisions on paymentsunder the procedures agreed under the Supplementary Measures Regulation.It agreed that the Community should contribute some 316 MEUA about 177 million)(2) in respect of investment programmes by central governmentand public corporation spending authorities in the North West of Englandand in Wales.  97-6 million of this amount was received in the form ofan advance payment on 31 December.Budgetary QuestionsThe 1980 Community Budget5.6 On 7 October the Foreign Affairs Council decided that advancesof up to 200 MEUA (about  135 million)(2) of the payments due to theUnited Kingdom under the Supplementary Measures Regulation in respect0) Converted at the December market rate of 1 -78 eua =  1.(2) Converted at the rate of 1-4813 eua =  1 used by the Commission for 1980 Budgetpurposes.13121D*
of our contribution to the 1980 Budget should be paid. A Supplementaryand Amending Budget No 1 for the year 19S0 provided for payment to theUnited Kingdom of 119-7 MEUA (about  80-S millionX1&quot;) to&quot; be financedfrom available surplus revenue: it also provided for the necessary technicaladjustments to the revenue section of the budget and for increased refundsof the costs of collecting own resources resulting from those adjustments.It was agreed that the remainder of the advances should be financed fromthe existing 1980 Budget. On 31 December we received from theCommission  97-6 million, the sterling equivalent of the amount which ithad been agreed should be paid to us.5.7 On 1 and 2 December the European Council considered theCommunity&apos;s response to the Italian earthquake and agreed that the Councilshould decide without delay, on a proposal from the Commission andas part of the normal budget procedures, to implement exceptional aidmeasures. Such measures were to be designed to make an effectivecontribution, mainly through a loan with an interest rate subsidy, towardsmitigating the effects of the disaster on the economic and social situation ofthe regions affected by the earthquake.5.8 The Commission accordingly proposed, in Preliminary DraftSupplementary Budget No 2 for 1980. that aid to disaster victims inthe Community should be increased by 40 MEUA (about  27 millionX1) tofinance the release to Italy of food stocks held in intervention. At thesame time the Commission took the opportunity to propose that the Euro-pean Social Fund should be increased by 100 MEUA (about  67 - 5 millionX&apos;)provide for payments due in respect of commitments already entered into.5.9 On 12 December the Council established a Draft SupplementaryBudget No 2 for 1980 in which the additional provision for the EuropeanSocial Fund was decreased to 60 MEUA (about  40-5 million&quot;).(&apos;) TheEuropean Parliament then considered this Draft Supplementary Budget No 2for 1980 in conjunction with the Draft Budget for 1981 (see paragraph5.17 below) during the week ended 19 December.The 1981 Community Budget5.10 Because of the time taken to agree and adopt the 1980 Budget itproved impossible for the Commission to prepare a Preliminary DraftBudget (PDB) for 1981 in time for it to be considered in July. TheCommission forwarded the PDB for 1981 to the Council on 18 August.Their proposals totalled 20,051 MEUA (about  12,619 millionX2) forpayments and 21,731-8 MEUA (about  13,677 million)(2) for commitments.5.11 The Draft Budget for 1981, established by the first Budget Councilon 23 September provided for smaller increases than those proposedby the Commission in the PDB; it totalled 19,239-9 MEUA (about 12,109 millionX2) for payments and 20,902-2 MEUA (about  13,155millionX2) for commitments.   Within this total the payments provision for(&apos;) Converted at the rate of 1-4813 eua =  1 used by the Commission for 1980 Budgetpurposes.(2) Converted at the rate of 1 -5889 eua =  1 used by the Commission for 1981 Iiudgelpurposes.16
the European Social Fund was increased by 186 MEUA (about  117millionX1) or 49-7 per cent and for the European Regional DevelopmentFund by 97 MEUA (about  61 millionX1) or 24 per cent. The DraftBudget also provided for two major new items, 1075 MEUA (about  677millionX1) for the refunds payable to the United Kingdom under the 30 Maysettlement, and 117 MEUA (about  74 millionX1) for refunds of ownresources to Greece, as provided for in the transitional arrangementsincorporated in the Greek Accession Treaty.Amendments to the 1981 Draft Budget5.12 The provision for pre-accession aid to Portugal was added to theDraft Budget for 1981 after its establishment. The Finance Council agreedon 20 October for payments of 30 MEUA (about  18-9 millionX1) and60 MEUA (about  37   8 millionX1) for commitments.5.13 Following the agreement on the use of surplus revenue in 1980for advance payments to the United Kingdom (see paragraph 5.6 above) theprovision for expenditure under Chapter 58 (Supplementary Measures infavour of the United Kingdom) in the 1981 Budget was reduced. Thecompensatory refunds to Greece were also reduced to offset its contributionto measures to assist the United Kingdom.5.14 Following the Italian earthquake in November provision wasmade for a new heading in the 1981 budget to cover the annual fundingof interest subsidies on the emergency loans to Italy. An appropriation wasplaced to reserve to cover the cost of such subsidies in 1981. The necessaryletter of amendment to the draft budget for 1981 was adopted by theCouncil on 12 December.Consideration by the European Parliament5.15 The European Parliament considered the Draft Budget establishedby the Council and returned it to the Council with amendments andproposed modifications which had been adopted during the Parliament&apos;sproceedings on 6 November. The Parliament&apos;s proposals totalled 19,622MEUA (about  12,349 millionX1) for payments and 21,536 -87 MEUA(about  13,555 millionX1) for commitments. The  240 million net increasein payments proposed by the European Parliament was principally in respectof the European Regional Development Fund, increased by 270 MEUA(about  170 millionX1), the European Social Fund increased by 135 MEUA(about  85 millionX1), Aid to Non-Associated Developing countries, increasedby 42 MEUA (about  26-4 million)(1), and various other areas of theBudget where the Council had proposed reductions. The Parliament alsoproposed modifications aimed at reducing the expenditure on the CommonAgricultural Policy.5.16 At the second Budget Council on 24 November the Council tookdecisions on the Parliament&apos;s amendments and proposed modifications tothe 1981 Draft Budget which resulted in proposals totalling 19,280-75MEUA (about  12,135 millionX1) for payments and 21,070-4 MEUA (about(&apos;) Converted at the rate of 1-5889 eua =  1 used by the Commission for 1981 Budgetpurposes.1312117D*2
 13,261 million)C) for commitments. Although the Council reduced theParliament&apos;s proposals for payments by 340 MEUA (about  214 million)(1)over the whole range they accepted the Parliament&apos;s modifications whichreduced proposed expenditure on the subsidy granted for the use of skimmedmilk powder as a feed for calves by 50 MEUA (about  31-5 million)C) andtransferred 2 per cent of the provision for all the items in the CAPGuarantee Section of the Budget (totalling some 254-5 MEUA, about 160 million^1) to a reserve as an incentive to the Commission to seekeconomies in this area of the Budget.5.17 The Parliament then considered the modified Draft Budget duringits proceedings in the week ended 19 December. There had been someconsultation between the Council and the Parliament during that week andthe Parliament was not content with the Council&apos;s final position. On18 December the Parliament voted on both the 1980 Supplementary BudgetNo 2 and the 1981 Budget. On the 1980 Supplementary Budget theParliament voted amendments totalling 266-4 MEUA (about  180 million)(2)for Social Fund payments. On the 1981 Budget it voted amendmentstotalling 30 MEUA (about  18-9 million)0 in commitments and 24-5MEUA (about  15-4 millionX1) in payments.5.18 The Budget Council met on 22 December but did not reach adecision to reject or modify the amendments which the Parliament had madeto the 1980 Supplementary Budget.5.19 Having been informed of the outcome of the Council meeting on22 December the President of the European Parliament announced on23 December that she had declared both the 1980 Supplementary Budget andthe 1981 Budget adopted.5.20 Some Member States called in question the legality of the EuropeanParliament&apos;s adoption of increases to the 1980 Supplementary Budget on thescale adopted and indicated that they were going to withhold payment ofpart of the additional own resources contributions which the Commissionhad requested.Harmonisation of Excise DutiesTobacco5.21 In July the Commission submitted to the Council proposals fora third stage of harmonisation of the excise duty on cigarettes, to replacethe second stage due to expire at the end of 1980. Little progress wasmade when these proposals were discussed in September and it was agreedto defer further discussion until the opinions of the European Parliamentand the Economic and Social Committee had been received. These werenot available by the end of the year and accordingly a Directive extendingthe second stage of harmonisation for a further six months was adoptedby the Council in December. This extension also applied to the derogationallowing the United Kingdom to levy an additional duty on higher tar(&apos;) Converted at the rate of 1-5889 eua =  1 used by the Commission for 1981 Budgetpurposes.(2) Converted at the rate of 1-4813 eua =  1 used by the Commission for 1980 Budgetpurposes.18
cigarettes, the future of which is to be discussed in the light of a reportissued by the Commission in December.Alcoholic Drinks5.22 Proposals for the harmonisation of the structure of excise dutieson alcoholic drinks were discussed at a Fiscal Council on 27 October buta further Council meeting planned for 22 December was cancelled. TheEuropean Court was due to reconsider at the end of 1980, infractionproceedings which the Commission had brought against the United Kingdomalleging breaches under Article 95 of the EEC Treaty through the unequalimposition of duties on beer and wine. The Court have however agreed topostpone their reconsideration of the case until the end of April 1981.Export Credit5.23 In accordance with the agreement reached by Heads of State andGovernment at the Venice Economic Summit in June 1980, discussions havecontinued on possible changes to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Arrangement on Guidelines for ExportCredit, governing officially supported export credit on terms of two years ormore, as a means of strengthening the Arrangement and limiting destructivecompetition between credit giving countries. In particular, further attemptshave been made to reach a mutually acceptable solution on the revisionof the interest rate structure, on the basis of the alternatives discussed inan OECD study group report. A Community proposal for another increasein interest rates was not acceptable to other participants. It has howeverbeen agreed to resume discussions in 1981, as part of the annual review ofthe Arrangement.Public Purchasing5.24 On 22 July the Foreign Affairs Council adopted a new Directivesupplementing Directive 77/62/EEC in order to apply the provisions ofthe GATT Code on Government Procurement within the Community. TheCode, which the Community signed in December 1979 and which came intoeffect on 1 January 1981, imposes additional obligations upon specifiedpublic purchasing bodies (excluding local authorities) and lowers the level ofthe threshold above which they are required to advertise public suppliescontracts to 150,000 SDR/140,000 EUA (about  91,000 at December 1980exchange rates).Financial Control in The Community (Court of Auditors)5.25 In September a Conference of the National Audit Authorities ofthe Member States of the European Community and the European Courtof Auditors was held in London. At its meeting on 6 NovemberMr. Michael N. Murphy was re-elected President of the Court.Adoption of the European Currency Unit (ECU)5.26 On 16 December the Council adopted two Regulations concerningthe ECU. One was a Financial Regulation amending the FinancialRegulation of 21 December 1977 on the use of the ECU in the general19
budget of the European Communities. The other was on the replacementof the EUA by the ECU in other legal acts of the Community. Bothcame into force on 1 January 1981. These changes did not affect existingfigures expressed in EUA because the EUA and ECU comprise an identicalbasket of European currencies.SECTION VI: REGIONAL AND INDUSTRIAL AFFAIRSEuropean Coal and Steel Community (ECSC): Loans6.1 The ECSC made loans totalling  15.3 million under Article 56 ofthe Treaty of Paris following applications from United Kingdom companiesin respect of projects creating employment opportunities for ex-steel andcoal workers. Further loans are under negotiation. The United KingdomGovernment provided guarantees against possible loss or currencyfluctuations over the period of the loans for projects in the Assisted Areas.European Regional Development Fund6.2 On 7 October the Foreign Affairs Council adopted five newRegulations concerning specific regional development measures for makinguse of the 5 per cent non-quota section of the Fund. The United Kingdomwill benefit from three of the measures by 58 MEUA (about  32   6 million)(1)over a five-year period.6.3 The size of the Fund in 1980 was established at 1165 MEUA (about 654-5 million)0 of which 95 per cent, or 1106-75 MEUA (about  621-8millionX1) was allocated to the quota section. The United Kingdom shareof this was 27-03 per cent of 299-15 MEUA (about  168 millionX1).Because of the appreciation of sterling against the EUA, over 50 MEUA(about  28   1 millionX1) have been allocated by the Commission to safeguardsterling payments of previously approved commitments.6.4 The size of the Fund for 1981 has been set at 1540 MEUA (about 865 millionX1) of which the quota section is 1463 MEUA (about  821-9million)Q. At the Foreign Affairs Council on 15/16 December it wasagreed that following the accession of Greece, which will have a 13 percent quota, the quotas of the other nine Member States will be revised, andthe United Kingdom quota for 1981 will be 23-8 per cent or 348-19MEUA (about  195-6 millionX1).Review of Regional Aids by the Commission6.5 The United Kingdom continued to supply the Commission withinformation on United Kingdom regional aids as part of the Commission&apos;sreview of Member States&apos; systems of regional aids. The review is nowexpected to be completed in the first half of 1981.European Investment Bank (EIB): Loans6.6 Private sector manufacturing industry in the Assisted Areascontinued to receive foreign currency loans from EIB with the Government(&apos;) Converted at the December market rate of 1-78 eua =  1.20
covering them against exchange risk. Loans totalling  47-6 million weremade during the second half of 1980 to United Kingdom private sectorinvestment projects in the Assisted Areas and further loans are undernegotiation.Science and Technology6.7 On 11 November the Council agreed to increase the duration of thepaper and board recycling research and development programme from threeyears to four years (1978-81) without increasing the expenditure involved,2-9 MEUA (about  1-6 millionX1). Research under this programme isbeing directed towards the characterisation of reclaimed fibres, theelimination of detrimental contaminants in waste paper, de-inking and thetreatment of effluent from waste paper recycling plants, the use of urbanfibres and the health problems caused by the use of recycled fibres. TheCouncil also agreed to the Community&apos;s participation in COST (EuropeanCo-operation in Science and Technology) Project 47 on research into benthiccoastal ecology. The project had already been agreed in April 1979 bythe United Kingdom and six other members of COST which comprises 19Western European countries, including all the Member States of theCommunity. The Community&apos;s scientific contribution to the project will beprovided from its existing research programmes. The Community will alsoassist in providing secretarial support for the project.6.8 On 4 December Council agreement was given to the Community&apos;sparticipation in two further COST projects. The first COST project 11 bis,relates to an agreement between the Community, Finland and Sweden ona concerted action project concerning research into teleinformatics; theproject will promote collaboration and the exchange of information in thefield of processing and transmission of data between databases andsubscribers. The second, COST project 91, is the result of an agreementbetween the Community, Switzerland and Sweden on research into theeffects of thermal processing and distribution on the quality and nutritivevalue of food.Steel6.9 In the face of a sharp fall in demand for steel last summer,accompanied by a slump in prices, the Commission proposed and a Councilof Industry Ministers on 30 October agreed to the introduction of mandatoryproduction quotas under Article 58 of the ECSC Treaty on most basicsteel products and for all except small producers until 30 June 1981. Theaim is to stabilise the market. The Government would have preferred asystem of voluntary production restraint but, as this proved to be unobtain-able, gave the proposals full support with firm backing from the BritishSteel Corporation, the British Independent Steel Producers Association andthe Trades Unions.6.10 Imports of steel into the European Community have since 1978been restrained by voluntary arrangements negotiated by the Commissionwith major steel exporting countries. The negotiation of the volumeprovisions for  1981  will take account of the predicted reduction inQ) Converted at the December market rate of 1-78 eua =  1.21
Community steel consumption in 1981 as well as the decision to imposequotas on production under Article 58 of the ECSC Treaty. The aim is a15 per cent volume cutback in imports.Shipbuilding6.11 With the other Member States the United Kingdom have beenworking towards agreement on the Commission&apos;s proposals for a fifth direc-tive on aid to shipbuilding. This instrument would continue the frameworkfor the provision and control of aids to the industry for the next two years.As agreement was not reached by the end of the year, the fourth Directivewas temporarily extended pending agreement.New Information Technology (Telematics)6.12 Following a remit from the November 1979 European Council theCommission have been developing a proposed common strategy in thisarea. Useful progress has been made in two areas with the Commissionbringing forward a draft regulation for a scheme of assistance for micro-electronics production and draft recommendations for greater harmonisationand more open markets in telecommunications equipment. Discussion ofboth proposals has now started at technical level. The United KingdomGovernment continue to support strongly this initiative.Company Law6.13 Negotiations continued on a number of draft directives includingthose dealing with the accounts of groups of companies, scissions (thedivision of public companies), the qualifications of auditors, collectiveinvestment funds (unit trusts), the right of establishment for accountants andthe regular disclosure of information by companies whose shares areadmitted to stock exchange listing. Member States have also been sent adraft of the proposed convention on bankruptcy and have been invited tosubmit comments to the Commission during the first few months of 1981.In addition negotiations continued on the proposed regulation to providefor the incorporation of a European Company under Community Law.6.14 The Commission continued to hold discussions, with MemberStates or private interests, on a wide range of proposals for Communitylegislation including those covering annual accounts of credit institutions,&quot; insider&quot; dealing, prospectuses for unlisted securities and the conduct ofgroups of public companies.Insurance6.15 The draft directive to facilitate the freedom to provide insuranceservices throughout the Community was discussed by a Council WorkingGroup. The United Kingdom Government remain strongly in favour ofthis directive and the Prime Minister drew attention at the European Councilin December to the need to speed its adoption.Industrial Property6.16 Work continued on the problems in connection with the imple-mentation of the Community Patent Convention.    On  15 November,22
following several years of expert working group discussions, the Commissionsubmitted to the Council its combined proposal for a first Council directiveto approximate the laws of Member States relating to trade marks and for aCouncil resolution on Community trade marks.SECTION VII: ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORTEnvironmental Issues7.1 The Environment Council met on 12 December. A Regulationbanning the import of all primary and some secondary whale products wasagreed, the result of an initiative originally proposed by the UnitedKingdom in October 1979. A recommendation encouraging the use through-out the Community of recycled waste paper and board was agreed inprinciple and was sent to the European Parliament.7.2 The greater part of the Council was devoted to discussion of thedraft directives on major accident hazards and the discharge of mercury intothe aquatic environment by the chlor-alkali industry. Adoption of themajor accident hazards directive, aimed at reducing the danger of majorindustrial accidents, was frustrated by continued difficulties over trans-frontier implications. Discussion of the mercury directive did not manageto resolve the central problem, namely the difficulty of providing for bothrecognised methods of controlling water pollution, uniform emission limitsand environmental quality objectives.Inland Transport7.3 At the Transport Council on 4 December, agreement was reached ona first Directive on the introduction of a European Community drivinglicence. The Directive will enable nationals of Community Member Statesmoving from one Member State to another after 1 June 1983 to exchangetheir national driving licence without taking a further test. The UnitedKingdom will exchange public service vehicle and heavy goods vehiclelicences on the basis of certificates of adequate experience signed by aprevious employer and validated in cases of serious doubt by the competentauthorities of the Member State whose licence is being exchanged. TheDirective also provides for all ordinary driving licences within the Communityto be issued in a common format from 1 January 1986. There is adeclaration of intent to lay down as soon as possible further harmonisedstandards for driving tests and licensing with a view to improving roadsafety throughout the Community.7.4 A Directive on statistical returns in respect of the carriage of goodsby rail was agreed, and proposals on rail tariffs and combined transport wereconsidered but not finally agreed. The Transport Council also consideredproposals for an increase in the Community road haulage quota, but didnot reach a decision. An allocation to Greece, to take account of heraccession on 1 January 1981, was agreed.  The Council in taking note of23
the Commission&apos;s report of the implementation during 1977 of theRegulation on Drivers&apos; Hours adopted a Resolution stressing the needfor tougher and more consistent enforcement throughout the Community.7.5 Among progress reports to the Council was one on the draftregulation on EC aid to transport infrastructure projects of Communityinterest. The Commission is to submit to the Council as soon as possiblea report on the criteria for assessing projects of Community interest. TheCouncil also heard a statement by the Commission on priorities and thetimetable for decisions to be taken by the Council up to the end of 1983.Shipping7.6 The Commission continued discussions with European shippers andshipowners on the content of a draft regulation applying the CompetitionRules in the EEC Treaty to shipping.7.7 Examination of various proposals intended to promote marinesafety and pollution prevention continued in Council Working Groups. Twoparticular proposals under examination are a directive concerning theenforcement in respect of shipping prevention and a decision establishinga Community information system for the prevention and combating of oilpollution of the sea.Civil Aviation7.8 Responding to a request from the Council, and after consultationwith Member States&apos; experts, the Commission submitted to the Councilin December a draft regulation for the liberalisation of intra-Communityregional air services. This was remitted for discussion in the CouncilWorking Group.7.9 In response to requests from the Council to examine the question ofair fares in the Community and report back, the Commission has continuedits consultations with Member States&apos; experts and with interested outsidebodies in the Community.7.10 The Commission has completed its consultation with MemberStates&apos; experts on the possible terms of a draft regulation for the applicationof the Competition Articles of the EEC Treaty (Articles 85 and 86) to civilaviation prior to preparing a draft.SECTION VIII: SOCIAL AFFAIRSEmployment8.1 The Standing Committee on Employment (representatives fromemployers and workers as well as Employment Ministers and theCommission) met on 30 October and discussed the Commission&apos;s proposalon guidelines for Community action in the field of temporary employment.The conclusions of the meeting welcomed the Council&apos;s determination to24
achieve progress on the supervision of temporary work and social protectionof temporary workers, in accordance with the Council Resolution on theadaptation of working time and taking account of the situation in theMember States.8.2 The Committee met again on 11 December to discuss voluntarypart-time work and flexible retirement. On part-time work the majority ofthe Committee felt that the benefits (including pay) which part-time workersenjoy should, as a general rule, be proportional to those enjoyed by full-timeworkers. On the question of flexible retirement its attractions were recog-nised but it was emphasised that its financial impact should be neutral. TheCommission was invited to prepare appropriate proposals for future actionat Community level in the light of the Committee&apos;s discussions.8.3 The Labour and Social Affairs Council met on 27 November. Themain employment question under consideration was the European SocialFund. The four Council Decisions granting aid from the Social Fund toworkers in the textiles and clothing industries, migrant workers, youngpeople under 25 and women were extended for two years.8.4 An exchange of views took place on the proposal for a regulationon assistance from the European Social Fund to provide income support forworkers in the shipbuilding industry. It was agreed that the proposal shouldbe further considered by officials before it was again brought to theattention of the Council.8.5 The Council also considered the activities of the Social Fund in1979, together with the Commission&apos;s and Member States&apos; comments on it.European Social Fund8.6 In October, the Commission announced the second and final batchof Social Fund allocations for 1980. They included  71-9 million for theUnited Kingdom, bringing our total allocations for 1980 to  135 million.The following table shows how the United Kingdom allocations weredistributed between different areas of intervention:Young people ...............	  71,871,133Regions of high unemployment .........	50,416,425Disabled people ...............	9,331,496Workers from the textiles and clothing industries	1,201,469Migrant workers ...............	1,202,536Women aged 25 and over............	64,502Technical progress...............	720,329Groups of undertakings	544,402Pilot scheme ...............	55,500Social Security8.7 The 27 November Labour and Social Affairs Council agreed to theCommission&apos;s proposals for extending the cover of the Regulations on socialsecurity to the self-employed and their families.  The proposals were largely25
the result of a United Kingdom initiative. An important feature of theextension will be that self-employed persons, and their families, who fallill or have an accident while visiting another Member State will be entitledto the medical treatment which is immediately necessary from the sicknessinsurance scheme of that State, on the same terms as its own insuredpopulation. The new arrangements are likely to come into operation aroundthe end of 1981.8.8 The Council could not reach agreement on extension of theRegulations to cover also the insured non-employed because of a reservationon the use of Article 235 of the Treaty as authority for the extension. AllMember States agreed, however, that such persons, and their families, whofell ill while visiting another Member State should receive medical treatmenton the same basis as employed and self-employed persons.8.9 The Council also considered the Commission&apos;s proposal for anamendment to the Regulations in order to standardise the system of payingfamily benefits to workers in one Community country whose children livein another Community country. No agreement was reached but discussionsare to continue.Anti-Poverty Programme8.10 The programme of pilot schemes and studies to combat poverty,which was set up in 1975, came to an end in November and the Commissionis to produce a report on it by June 1981.8.11 A proposal for an &quot;interim&quot; Community programme to combatpoverty intended to cover the period (about two years) between November1980 and the setting up of any further programme based on the evaluationof the present one, was accepted at the November Labour and Social AffairsCouncil. The proposal enables the Commission to mount a programme ofresearch to fill in gaps and supplement the knowledge gained from the firstprogramme. But the budget appropriations available for this interimprogramme are relatively small, and total spending will be limited to some700,000 EUA (about  393,000).(1) The levels of spending in the two yearsof the interim programme will be much lower than those in the five years ofthe main programme, and EC funding for existing action projects under themain programme will not be extended.Education8.12 There was continuing disagreement among Member States aboutthe basis for financing new educational expenditure from the CommunityBudget and, as a result, the report accepted by Education Ministers in June1980 has not yet been implemented.C) Converted at the December market rate of 1   78 eua =  1.26
SECTION IX: ENERGY9.1 The 27 November Energy Council considered the oil supplysituation in the light of the reduction in supplies resulting from the conflictbetween Iran and Iraq, and concluded that there was no overall oil shortfallof supplies and that price increases in the oil markets were unjustifiedin the present circumstances.9.2 The Council expressed its determination to do everything possibleto prevent tension on the oil market in coming months. In furtherance ofthis aim and provided that other industrialised consumer countries didlikewise, the Member States of the Community undertook: to ask oilcompanies to use those stocks in excess of the reserves required byCommunity regulations; to take all necessary measures in conjunction withoil companies to prevent import prices from varying from normal, or to askoil companies to refrain from making abnormal purchases; to encouragethe adjustment of supplies to correct imbalances which pose particularproblems for some Member States; to encourage oil saving and oilsubstitution; and to support domestic production at a high level. Theseconclusions on the oil supply situation formed the basis for the Community&apos;sapproach to the International Energy Agency Energy Ministers meeting on8-9 December.9.3 The November Council also noted a Commission communication onoil production spot markets which assessed studies made of the oil spotmarkets transactions in 1978 and 1979; and agreed, after discussion, thatfurther consideration should be given to the Commission proposal to extendthe Regulations concerning the registration of crude oil and petroleumproduction purchases. A statement by the Commission on Communityenergy objectives formed the basis for a constructive exchange of views aboutthe respective contributions which both national and Community actioncould make in achieving the energy guidelines for 1990 agreed by the13 May Energy Council.9.4 The Council also noted a statement by the Commission on itscommunication &apos; Energy and Economic Policy&apos;; the paper was subsequentlyexamined by the Finance Council on 15 December. The Council consideredand agreed in principle the Commission&apos;s draft recommendation onelectricity tariff structures in the Community.9.5 In December the Council agreed to set up a Consultative Committeeto help the Commission in its task of implementing the Community&apos;s researchprogramme on nuclear fusion.9.6 Between July and December 1980 the Department of Energy andthe energy industries received some  10 million in finance from Communitysources, including the ECSC, Euratom and European Regional DevelopmentFund. These were used for a number of energy projects, including coaltechnology and nuclear research. Funds (exact figures are not available)were also received for research on alternative energy sources and demon-stration projects.27
SECTION X: THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE COMMUNITYThe European Parliament10.1 The European Parliament held six plenary sittings of which twowere in Luxembourg and four in Strasbourg.European Court of Justice10.2 Discussions about an enlargement of the Court by increasing thenumber of both Judges and Advocates General continued. The CouncilWorking Party charged with these questions also considered a proposal fromthe Commission to create an administrative staff tribunal to hear disputesbetween members of the staff and the institutions of the Community. InOctober Judge Hans Kutscher, the President of the Court retired fromthe Court and was succeeded as President by Judge Mertens de Wilmarsfrom Belgium.10.3 During the second half of 1980 three cases were referred forpreliminary ruling to the Court from United Kingdom courts and the UnitedKingdom submitted written observations in seven cases referred by the courtsof other Member States. In addition the United Kingdom, in parallel withFrance and Italy, initiated a direct action against the Commission seekingthe annulment of Commission Directive 80/723 which relates to greatertransparency in the transfer of public funds to public undertakings inMember States. While not dissenting from the objectives of the Directive,the Government does not accept that the Commission has the vires underArticle 90 of the EEC Treaty to adopt such a Directive.10.4 The Court has given judgment in three cases of particularsignificance during this period. In Commission v UK (the &quot; FisheriesCases&quot;) the Court held that the UK was in breach of its Communityobligations in adopting three fishery conservation measures because, inparticular, there had not been the requisite consultation with the Commission.In Regina v Pieck the Court held that any formality for the purpose ofgranting leave to enter coupled with a passport or identity check at afrontier amounted to an entry visa or equivalent requirement which maynot be imposed between Member States, and also that failure to comply withan administrative formality (in that case failure to apply for a residencepermit) should not be punishable with deportation or imprisonment. In adirect action by the Commission against the Belgian Government whichconcerned the admission of nationals of other Member States to the Belgianpublic service, the Court&apos;s judgment throws new light on the extent towhich such restrictions are permissible.SECTION XI: PARLIAMENT11.1 Parliament was in session for 13 weeks between 1 July and 31December 1980. During that time the House of Commons Select Committeeon European Legislation etc considered 363 Community documents and28
recommended 64 of these for further consideration by the House. TheHouse of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities considered388 documents of which 7 were recommended for debate. Debates on 15documents were held in the House of Commons and on 6 in the House ofLords.29

UNITED KINGDOM VISIBLE TRADE WITH HITEUROPEAN COMMUNITYANNEX VImportance of Trade &gt;vith the European Community1. United Kingdom trade with the European Community accounts forover 40 per cent of our overseas trade. In 19S0 our leading export market wasthe Federal Republic of Germany while all the Community countries were inour top dozen export markets.Trade Performance with the European Community (sec Table 02. Our visible trade with the European Community is likely to show amodest surplus in 1980 against a deficit of  2- 2J billion in each of the years1974 to 1979. The ratio of our exports to the Community to our importsfrom the Community, which makes some allowance for inflation, recoveredduring that time and exceeded 100 in 1980 the highest figure since beforeAccession. Although the improvement in 1980 owed much to a virtuallyunchanged value of imports, exports showed a reasonable increase.By Commodity (see Table 2)3. During the 1970s our trade performance in manufactures, whichaccount for about 70 per cent of our trade with the European Community,deteriorated. However, this performance as measured by the ratio of exportsto imports was similar to that with the rest of the developed world and indeedin 1980 it was somewhat better. The United Kingdom share of the EuropeanCommunity import market for manufactures for ll&gt;7&apos;&gt; (about 7 per cent) islikely to have been roughly maintained in the first half of ll)S0. the latest periodfor which the information is available. In non-manufactures there have beenimprovements in our trade with the Community in each of the major com-ponents food, drink and tobacco, basic materials and particularly fuels asexports of oil have increased rapidly over the last two years.4. Any apparent discrepancy in the statistics given in Tables I and 2 isdue to rounding.42
