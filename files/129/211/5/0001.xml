NETANNUAL SCRUTINY OF DEI &gt; AHTMENT A LRUNNING COSTSMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilINTRODUCTION1. Following our discussion in Octobor 1979 (CC(79) L6th Conclusions)Sir Derek Rayner wrote advising Ministers how to examine the cost ofrunning their Departments.   The results of a first pilot run have beencollated and, together with a commentary by officialh, are  il the Annex.I regret the length of the Annex,  hut in this Qrnt instance there in noalternative.MAIN FEATURES AND FURTHER ACTION NOW REQUIRED2. The total cost of Government Department! not including the NorthernIreland Civil Service was  6, 680 million in 1979-80.    The total Estimatesprovision for 1980-81 was  8,340 million.     These are very large sums ofmoney which deserve all our attention.3. The largest single element is wages and salaries which account lor60 per cent of the total,   5, 035 million in 1980-81.     This was an estimatedincrease of 24 ;&lt;er cent compared with 1979-80, for reasons familiar to us.The 1980 pay awards were kept within the 14 per cent cash limit fad or bymeans of manpower reductions and minor staging hut we also had to allow lorthe full effect of the major staging of the previous Government&apos;s 197V payawards.     Cost increases wort: large in the other areas of expenditure:personnel overheads and accommodation costs up 21 per cent, and office andother services up 32 per cent.4. Overall, expenditure was estimated to ri se by Z&apos;&gt; per &lt; oil in 1980-81.Excluding the distorting effect of the 1979 pay staging,  the estimatedincrease was about 18 per cent, in line with the general lev&lt; I of inflation.This is not satisfactory.    A great deal of money is at Stake!   we mustexamine these figures carefully and make savings wherever i.hey can befound.5. A striking feature of the figures is the extreme variation betweenDepartments.    Some of this may well be due to inaccuracies in the figures,but high levels of cost per employee, and large increases in cost, if theycannot be satisfactorily explained, must be grappJed with.1COPY NOQ 1RESTRICTED

Thi   exercise has proved its value by raising some very Importantquestions.    To confirm its value as a tool of management,  I think it shouldbe repeated in 1981.     Ah the note by officials points out,  there are technicalquestions to be ironed out before the next round.     I propone to set up a smallworking group of officials to look into this urgently, in consultation withSir Derek Rayner,    They will also need to consider the timing ofdepartmental returns for the next round so that tin   .xreise can l&gt;&lt; Ixttorco-ordinated with tho Public Expenditure Survey and Estimates cycle,PUBLICATION8.

But colleagues may feel we could reasonablydelay at least until after the programme of Departmental investigations andthe further report to Cabinet I have proposed.RECOMMENDATIONS9. I invite colleagues to agree that:a. Departments and the CSD (consulting the Treasury whereappropriate) should investigate tie figures critically, lookingparticularly at areas where; they are high and, where there in nocompelling reason, ensure that action is taken to bring costsunder greater control;b.

RESTRICTEDA.NNEXANNUAL SCRUTINY OF DEPARTMENTAL COSTS: NOTE Bft OFFICIALSIntroductionIn the autumn of 1979 Cabinet decided that department t,n l Midi u Uirnshould scrutinise the staff costs and overheads of their department^and that an annual statement of the cost of government should beprepared by CSD.    Sir Derek Rayner wrote to Ministers on 22 Februarywith advice on how to proceed and on 22 April the Minister of State Civil Service Department, wrote confirming that the return for- ouchDepartment (excluding Trading Funds) should be set out Ln  the formannexed to Sir Derek Rayner&apos;s letter.    This was Lo be accompnn I e&lt;3 bya commentary summarising the nature of the scrutiny which hnd beencarried out and the consequent action which it had been deoided totake, together with any general observations on the exercise.2.     Returns were submitted by all departments in the form propoeediFor the purpose of this paper the numerical data OOZltained  in thereturns has been summarised as follows:Diagram A: Expenditure by departments in 1980 81Diagram B: Breakdown of expenditure in 1900-81Diagrams C (i)-(vii):       Major items of expenditure and totalexpenditure by department, showing &quot;/ &lt;increase in costs between  1979-80 and1980-81 and cost per employee in 1980-81Annex A: A consolidated statement of the cost of centralgovernment in 1978-79,  1979-80 and 1980-81, with abreakdown into the major items.Annex B: A statement of each department&apos;s expenditure in 1980-81for each major item and in total.1RESTRICTED
RESTRICTEDAnnex C: A statement of each department&apos;s expenditure for eachmajor item in total, and per permanent employee, for1978-79,  1979-80 and 198O-81, showing the change inexpenditure between 1979-80 and 1980-81.Price and volume basis of figures3. Outturn figures were used for 1978-79, and forecast outturnfigures for 1979-80.    However, voted provision (also at outturnprices) was used for 1980-81,  so the figures for that year are no Idirectly comparable with those for 1979-80.    Since Votes are treatedas cash limits which cannot be exceeded, actual expenditure in1980-81 may be expected to have been overstated by something of theorder of 2$. There may also be offsetting increases and decreasesbetween individual items of expenditure in 1980-81.    Notional costswere included for each year at the appropriate price level.Staff numbers4. The figures for 1978-79 and 1979-80 are the average numbers ofpermanent staff in post in those years; the 1980-81 total is thatunderlying the original Estimates, less the savings from the 2^ff  cashlimit squeeze.    These figures include industrial and non-industrialcivil servants, but also some 40,000 staff locally engaged overseasby the Ministry of Defence and Foreign and Commonwealth Office (no!,counted as civil servants).    Some 33,000 civil servants who work inTrading Funds -Royal Ordnance Factories, Property Services AgencySupplies, the Royal Mint and Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office -(1979-80 and 1980-81 only) are excluded from the figures, as arecasual staff.    Over the years covered by the returns, average staffnumbers fell from 755,000 in 1978-79, to 735,000 in 1979-80 and to721,000 in 1980-81.Total cost5. On the basis of the figures provided, the total cost of runningcentral government departments rose by 25^ between 1979-80 and 1980 81 from  6,679 million to  8,336 million.    These figures differ fromthose in published Estimates (which were used as the basis for the2RESTRICTED
RESTRICTEDexhibition at No 10 Downing Street in early December on the cost ofthe Civil Service) mainly because of the inclusion of notional costsfor the pensions of serving staff and for the rental value of Crownproperty.    Cash expenditure accounts for 87$ of the total.By contrast,  the overall rate of inflation between the first 6 monthsof 1979-80 and 1980-81, as measured by the GDP deflator, was 18$.6. The shares of total cost accounted for by the larger departmentsis shown in Diagram A.    On the basis of calculation used in this year&apos;sexercise, the Ministry of Defence accounts for about one quarter ofthe total, and, together with the next two largest departments, DHSSand Inland Revenue, for one half.7. The major items of cost maintained a very similar relationshipto total costs in both years.    The 1980-81 position is shown inDiagram B.    In that year, wages and salaries made up 60$ of totalexpenditure, accommodation costs 7$, office services 6$ and otherexpenditure 14$.    Notional costs made up 13$ of the total.8. The total cost per permanent employee rose from about  9,000in 1979-80 to  11,500 in 1980 81.    The variation in cost increase andcost per employee between departments is shown in Diagram C(i).Wages and salaries9. Wages and salaries .comprise   the cost of wages, salaries, overtimepayments and employers&apos; National Insurance contributions forpermanent staff (as defined in paragraph 4), period appointees andcasuals, and Ministerial salaries.    Over the Civil Service as a wholethey represent about 60$ of total expenditure.    In some departmentsthe proportion is as high as 88$, in no department is it less than41$.10. Costs increased by over 24%, from  4-04-9 million to  5035 million,between 1979-80 and 1980-81 ;       nearly 11$ was caused by the built-ineffect of the major staging of the April 1979 pay award, offset by asmall reduction in volume, and 14$ by the cash limit increase in3RESTRICTED
RESTRICTED1980-61 (the higher pay settlements being offset by some r. tug L ngfor non-industrials, and a 2j$&gt; additional volume squeeze).By comparison, the New Earnings Survey which covers the economy an nwhole showed a rise in earnings for all non-manuals of 25.19&apos; betweenApril 1979 and April 1980, and of 21.3$ for all emp 1 oyoer,.    In nunicdepartments where there was a net growth in staff numberB between thetwo years, the percentage rise was in excess of 30$.11. The notional cost of the accruing liability for pensions ofserving staff was based on a standard of 197&apos; of the wagon andsalaries bill for non-industrials and 16$ for industrials (thisexcludes National Insurance, overtime and payments to casual staff).The resultant figure is 9$ of total expenditure.12. Taking cash and notional expenditure together,  (die .uve r:i,&quot;,o coul,of all wages and salaries and pensions per permanent employee rosefrom  6,375 in 1979-80 to  8,080 in  1980-81.    The vari a 1.1 on boLwoondepartments in cost increase and cost per employee is shown inDiagram C(ii).Personnel overheads13. These overheads (travel, subsistence, entertainment, removals,catering subsidies, protective clothing and external training)accounted for 3$ of total expenditure, and showed an increase in QOStof 21$ between 1979-80 and 1980-81. The average eo:il, per porrrianen I,employee rose from  194 to  2 36 between tho:;e year:;. The van a I, i onbetween departments in cost increase and cost per employee is shownin Diagram C(iii).14. Two-thirds of this expenditure io re pro? son tod by l,r?jvo I I i.ng aridsubsistence costs of staff on official duty.    The increase i.n eoetbetween 1979-80 and 1980-81 is in line with the increase in theretail price index between October 1979 and October 1980 of 24.8$for fares and 16.2$ for meals out.    The mileage allowance for oarsat the public transport rate has risen from 7.Op a mile in Apri I 1979by   37$ to 9.6p a mile currently.    The other aspects of expenditure4RESTRICTED
RESTRICTEDunder this heading constitute only a small part of departments&apos; budgets and showsignificant fluctuations within departments from year to year.Accommodation costs15. These costs consist of rents, rates, heating, lighting, utilities, furnitureand fittings, borne by the PSA on an Allied Service&apos; basis except for rates whichare the responsibility of RGPD who notified them direct to departments.* Acrossthe Civil Service expenditure exclusive of rents represents about 7% of totalexpenditure.      An equivalent market rental value was attributed to both Crown andleased property;    this adds a further k% of tot.i! expenditure Ln both Of I.hoseyears.     Taken together these cost elements show an increase of 21% botweon1979-80 and 1980-81.       By comparison, there were price increases betwoen the twoyears of nearly 27% in general rates and water charges by local authorities, and30% in heating and lighting.16. The cost of accommodation per permanent employee rose from  1,060 in 1979-80to  1,306 in 1980-81. The distribution by department of cost increases and costper employee is shown in Diagram o(iv) but because of tho method used to allocatocosts, any figures for individual departments must be regardod with caution.Office services17. Together these services make up 5-6% of total expondituro.     The incroaao incost between 1979-80 and 1980-81 was 32%, with the cost per permanent employeerising from  495 to  665.     The distribution by department of cost increases amicost per employee is shown in Diagram C(v).     The main items aro as followsi*   All accommodation costs apart from equivalent market rents and rates on head-quarters buildings and large regional offices were allocated to departments on a unit,rate basis derived from total expenditure by tho PSA on the Civil Estate as a whole.(PSA did net provide comparable figures for 1978-79 because of a change in themethod of measuring accommodation space).      Average market rents which reflect out-side market rent levels were derived on a location basis (3 rates for London plusa Provisional rate).     As fore-warned by the PSA, the unit rate principle for OtherCosts resulted from inconsistencies when applied to individual departments andcould not, therefore, reflect economies in costs to some extent under Departments&apos;own control (eg heating and lighting).     Provision of actual costs would involveconsiderable changes in the PSA&apos;s accounting and costing systems, which are gearedto the task of total management of the Civil Estate and not to dotailed breakdownof costs of Departments.     For 1931-82, refinements to Average Market Rents andrates ore being pursued, these costs representing from two-thirds to three-quartersof the total accommodation costs:    for the longer term, any changes must beconsistent with decisions on a possible system of repayrnont for PSA Services.CRESTRICTED
RESTRICTEDa. Postage:   postage has shown an increase as a result of higher postagerates, including the &quot;composite rate&quot; charged by the Post Offico for officialpaid envelopes, which rose by 38% from 8.&apos;+p in April 1979 to 11.5p at present.The introduction of public postal methods will ensure that oosts accuratelyreflect actual rates of usage of 1st and 2nd class mail.b. Printing and publications:    in 1978-79 and 1979-80 IIMSO incurred thesecosts on an allied service basis, and departments&apos; estimates provision for1980-81 is not directly comparable, particularly since it includes VAT forthe first time.      HMSO estimate that between September 1979 and September 1980stationery unit costs rose by 17.6$;   volume provision for 1980-81 was ionothan that for the previous year.c. Telecommunications:   the rise in the current year is caused mainly l&gt;,yincreased Post Office charges.     For example, a &apos;f minuto standard rate localcall increased from 3p in 1979 to &apos;+p now, a rioo of }rd.      Ilowovor, thecomparison was distorted by the slippage of telephone accounts follow!nr.industrial action in the Post Offico during 1979-80 which lod to an understatingof the cost in that year.d. Publicity and advertising:   this includes COI expenditure on boh/x.l f ofother departments.     Some departments reportod a reduction in advertisingduring 1979-80 because of the recruitment ban.e. Administrative computers:   this cost was borne by tho Central Computerand Telecommunications Agency on an allied service basis in 1978-79 and1979-80, but has now been transferred to repayment.Other services18.     The cost of services provided by the Post Office and other agencies rosebetween 1979-80 and 1980-81 from 7% to 8% of total expenditure;   there has been anincrease of 32% in costs.      The cost per permanent employee rose from to 87^ between these years.     The distribution by department of cost incroanes andcost per employee is shown in Diagram C(vi).6RESTRICTED

As well as providing Giro facilities, the Post Office acts as a.nagency for the payment of benefits, the sale of national savings andthe collection of Vehicle Excise Duty, under financial arrangementsagreed by the Treasury based on estimates of Post Office costs andvolume changes, which are subsequently ad juts ted.     In   the ear.o o I&apos;  I, hoDepartment of Health and Social Security, Post Office agency chargesconstitutes its second largest area of expenditure.    In theDepartment of National Savings they account for one-third of itsannual budget.20. Other agency services include contract cleaning, agency typists,security services, telephone operators and computer consultants.The use of these services, as opposed to in-house staff, depends ontheir relative cost and efficiency.Other non-office expenditure21. The cost of land, vehicles,  plant and equipment has remainedconstant at 2&gt;% of total expenditure over the  bant,  two yearn, duringwhich time there has been a 24$ rise in costs.    The din Ir i bu I, i.on bydepartment of cost increases is shown in Diagram C(viii); OOBt peremployee is not appropriate to this item of expenditure.7RESTRICTED
RESTRICTEDIVpartmcn ta 1   common U-  on   the exorcise22. Most Ministers - particularly those responsible for the majordepartments - considered the exercise useful and one which,  by givinga broad-brush illustration of expenditure and the deployment ofresources, adds to the climate of cost consciousness.    However,  in thecase of some of the smaller departments there were doubts whethertheir knowledge of costs or value for money had been improved, andconcern about the heavy demand that compiling the figures made ontheir resources.    A number of departments, of all sizes, commentedthat the exercise was an extension of the wide-ranging reviews ofadministrative costs that they already carried out at intervals.23. There was general agreement that the greatest bene I&apos;M, from theexercise lay in it being a starting point for further analysis, wi i,hdepartmental aggregates being broken down  Into organisational  un 1 tnfor purposes of comparison and in order to foster cost-consciousnessdown the management line.    The useful &quot;burrowing beneath the surface&quot;which the figures had prompted was producing additional managementinformation which was expected to lead to further economies andincreased general efficiency in departments.    However, with a highproportion of total expenditure on wages and salaries, the scope forsavings lay mainly in reductions in staff numbers, and to a lesserextent in detailed housekeeping.24. Although Ministers endorsed the value of the exercise generally,they pointed out that comparing cash expenditure over three yearsmade it difficult to separate increases from the effects of Lnflationfrom volume changes, and argued for a comparison at constant prioti*This is not, of course, to deny the need for regular monitoring ofcash costs, a point which Sir Derek emphasized in setting up theexercise.25. Some Ministers also urged caution in making comparisons betweenyears and drawing conclusions from the figures.    Since Estimatesreflect a cash limit rather than an expected budget, comparisonsbetween the figures for 1980-81 and the actual outturn for 1979-80suggest a larger percentage difference than will eventually be thecase.8RESTRICTED
RESTRICTED26. Ministers were in general agreement that the exercise needed bobe reviewed before the scrutiny was repeated.   Some were critioal 6tthe coverage of this year&apos;s exercise.    Defence Ministers, inparticular, were extremely doubtful  about,  the value el&apos;  11 ie I ml i 11,&quot;; alltheir civilian staff when many of these were viewed au support Stafffor the Armed Forces rather than as part of the adminiStratiVS OOBt Ofcentral government.    The Home Secretary I,bought that ths Offlisuion ofcosts incurred by fringe bodies was significant.   Generally,  it. wasaccepted that further refinement would be neeossary for the fUturSiIn  particular,  do par Imen Ls made   the  point,  that, aeeommoda I. i on eon t,:ibased on unit-rates should be viewed as approximations.   While theythought that those for rents were broadly consistent With their own,they expressed particular reservations about the application of bliSunit,  rate  prLnclp&apos;l e   l,o other  items,   such a:;  heal, in/-; and   I i ,&quot;,h I, i n/-&gt;;.They considered that this system of attributing costs failed l,orecognise that individual departments could to some sxtsnt OOntro]their own consumption by ensuring I,ha.

If the exercise is to be repeated there are a number of pointswhich should be reviewed urgently by official;;, before Lhe ox ere i nois repeated.    In particular:a. can   Lhe  returns,  and   Lhe  processes of compiling  I,hem, bosimplified?b. how can the need to make comparisons in both eai:h andvolume terms be met with minimum complication?   Could ca.:;bpercentage increases simply be set against the relevant RP3increases over the same period?9RESTRICTED
RESTRICTEDc.     how can comparability be ensured between one year andanother (comparisons between forecast outturn for 1979&quot;00 andestimates for 1980 81 caused difficulty on the first round)?In addition, it has been agreed that CSD and MOD Ministers slum Idconsider with Sir Derek Rayner on what basis figures should beprovided for the Ministry of Defence, where civilian staff work sideby side with the military.29.    In the slightly longer term, departments need to consider, withadvice from CSD if required,   how  her, I,   l,o  break  down   l.heir co:il,:i byorganisational unit in order to identify expensive and possiblywasteful areas of expenditure; and how their systems of financialinformation might, where necessary, be improved to make costinformation easier to identify and collate, in a way which iscompatible with the information required for PES and Estimates.RESTRICTED
