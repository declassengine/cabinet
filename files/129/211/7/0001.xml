CONFIDENTIAL ^ V oYw,DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF 11 FOR BRITANNIC MA.! EST Y &apos; S GOV KU N M ENTC(81) 7COPY NO     I j I21 January 1981CABINETcash limit FACTORSMemorandum by the Chancellor ol the ExchequerCabLiel decided on IS January (CC(8.1) 2nd Coiir&apos;iiinion ,   Minnie -I) thaithe cash limit factors lor 1981-82 in respect ol pay and i&gt;ri&lt;&lt; s should lierespectively 7 per cent and 10 per cent, instead of 6 per cent and 11 per cent.I was asked to discuss the time and form of the announcement of this with thecolleagues directly concerned.2. We have done this.     Hut our discussions about timing have shown thatthe decision on that raises a fundamental issue about the role ol cash I noils.Are cash limits to remain, as they have clone so far,   the frame-work olcontrol within which negotiations are conducted?     Or are cash limits to boregarded as (dements in the negotiations, to be varied it necessary? Giventhe difference of view on this fundamental issue,   I must bring (lie matter ha&lt; l&lt;to Cabinet again.3. The Lord President and the Secretary of Stale for Employ menl lifethe view that the; cash limit must not rule out the appoa.ram &lt;   ol realisticnegotiations.    They would prefer to start negotiations with an offer of6 per cent:  then move the cash limit to accommodate B settlement at a higherfigure.     They favour deferring an announcement ol the cash limit, preferablyuntil about 20 February, after a round of negotiations, or at least until alterthe conferences of Civil Service unions on 28 and 29 January.     I ending theannouncement the unions would presumably assume a cash limit of i&gt; per cant(on the basis of previously announced policy) arid would be &lt; onlent with asettlement seen as slightly in excess of it.4. If we adopted this approach,  we would hold to 6 per cent as the basisfor the Estimates and the White Paper without, announcing it.     Then,  if Libecame necessary as a result of negotiations to vary the cash limits wewould later announce that Parliamentary authority would be sought lor thenecessarv Supplementary Estimates.    The Lord President of the Counciland the Secretary of State for Employment argue that; this may tactically bethe best way to achieve a low settlement for the Civil Servii -    lus year. Onthis basis, it is argued, there is no point in announcing a now figure of7 per cent at this stage, if even that could not be regarded as more than .-,negotiating figure.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5. Those arguments clearly cannot be dismissed out of hind but they doinvolve a radical departure from existing policy with regard to (he use andpurpose of cash limits.     They would involve a reversal ol our I udument.aldecision in the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy in (he autumnthat we should conduct public- service pay negotiation;, this year within theframework set by cash limits:   cash limits should determine expenditure onpay.    Such a change would bo seen as going back on our earlier stand onpublic service pay.     Cash Hunts would be seen an a response to the outcomeof pay negotiations rather than the framework in which they can take place.This would be rightly criticised by the Confederation of British Industry andothers.    It would weaken substantially our position in relation to the localauthorities and their employees next year.     More generally it would undomuch that we have done to build up the er&lt; dibility of the cash limits system.6. After reflecting on colleagues&apos; arguments on this central question,I have concluded that we should adhere to our earlier decision that cashlimits should form the framework for negotiations,   rather than be an elementin them,  that they should bo set before negotiations start,  and that we shouldannounce the 7 per cent factor before the union conference,! on /.H January,so that it can be presented a s the applica lion of on r existing pol;c y of &quot;b road I ythe same financial discipline&apos;&apos;, and not be scion as a response l&lt;&gt; what is saidat those conferences.    Such an announcement would not necessarily beincompatible with settlements at l\ per cent which most col h agues regardas inevitable.7. The Secretary of State for Social Services shares this view:  he wouldprefer to give a firm figure to the management side in the National HealthService.     This too should be by the 28th.8. The position on the 10 per cent price factor reinforces the case for anearly announcement of the pay factor.     The change of the price factor mustbe made and announced now if it is to b&lt;   made at all.     The improvedinflation prospect  justifies 10 per cent.    Given the need to do everythingpossible to curb the scale of public expenditure-,  I am sure  ve should stick  o10 per cent and announce it now.     But we would then inevi tably be asked aboutour intentions on the pay factor.9. I therefore propose that the decision to change both factors should beannounced as soon as possible.    A draft is attached of a state men&apos; which Icould make on Monday 26 January if colleagues agree.CONCLUSION10. I accordingly invite colleagues:i.        to confirm that cash limits should set the frameworl forpay negotiations this year,  and should not be regarded asnegotiable;2
CONFIDENTIALii. to confirm that for the remaining cash limits the cashlimit factors should be 7 per cent and 10 per cent;iii.        to agree to my making a statement on the lines of theannexed draft on Monday next.G HTreasury Cn&amp;i^bere21 January 19813mucincKiTiAi
