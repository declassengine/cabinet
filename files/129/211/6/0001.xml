CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(81) 6 COPY NO      8 &apos;20 January 1901CABINETTHE FUTURE OF THE INNER LONDON ED HO AT [ON AUTHOR IT VMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Education and Science1. On 8 January 1 wis Luvit  d to r^-rxaminc urgently the future of theInner London Education Authority (I LEA ) in &lt; onsultation wi Mi   ollnagues .....-.1concerned (CC(81) 1st Conclusions, Minute 4). We have met twice under thechairmanship of the Chancellor of the Exchequer; and In this paper I reflecttheir views as far .is possible .is will .is my own.2. We have considered three issues - the structure ol ILKA, financialcontrols and the timing of an announcement of our decisions.STRUCTURE3. I recommend against total break-up &lt;&gt;l [LEA.     Oui  supporte m on ILEAnow share this view.     It makes z.o educational mum- to I r a g m en I reiiponsibility for higher, further and special education and the careers fervid, nm ,if only responsibility for primary and secondary schools were to be broken up,to separate schools from further education or ordinary schools from specialschools.     .Some of the new borough authorities would be very small,  .ind theywould find it very hard both to cope with fallin;; pupil numbers and to i m p r o v&lt;educational standards.     Moreover their expenditure on servic-s for which theyare already responsible is often even more extravagant than [LEA&apos;lexpenditure on education.4. An alternative would be partial break-up.     This might take the form ofallowing individual boroughs to secede by a g&gt;v  n date, and then to operate a  ,individual Local Education Authdities (LEAb) or form a statutory group OiLEAs, with responsibility either lor- primary and se&lt; onda i y :.&lt; hooJ s or loi .illLEA functions.     This option has obvious political attractions to some of 0U1supporters who may want to put it to the ele&lt; torate at the boi ough elections in1982.     Presumably at least the Conservative borOUghl v/ould take advantage ofit and so would the City, but the City would not wish to assume educationfunctions.    But it would still have some of the educational disadvantages oltotal break-up.     It would also create uncertainty which would be bad foreducation and local government.    The effect of secession would mean that1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthere would have to be fundamental changes in the London equalisationarrangements or Westminster and the City would cease to put into ILEA some 180 million of rate income which in 1981-82 will support education in the restof inner London.     Under block grant this would have to be paid for by Englishratepayers generally.     As a result the (rump) ILEA would get a bigger shareof block grant.5. We have considered and rejected various devices which fall short ofbreak-up or secession but which might reduce the power and increase thc&gt;accountability of ILEA.     One possibility (a variant of the arrangements forexcepted districts between 1944 and 1974 under which certain boroughs andurban districts exercised limited education functions) would be to allowindividual boroughs to assume responsibilities for, rfay,  schools. Anotherwould give each borough the right to veto any major changes tne ILEA wantedto make in its area, and a third, the obverse of this   would give primaryresponsibility to the boroughs, leaving ILEA a co-ordinating role.    But allthese solutions would involve divided responsibility, which would be bad toreducation and would require an extra layer of bureaucracy to handle relationsbetween the boroughs and ILEA.     They are as likely to waste money as tosave it and would not add to my powers to protect church schools from closure.6. We could reform the constitution of ILEA as a single authority byhaving all its members nominated by the boroughs and the City, with aprovision for minimum representation of minority parties.     Like oursupporters on ILEA,  we are opposed to this solution which would amongstother things generally leave the majority party on ILEA in a stronger positionthan it is today.7. They have now swung behind the option of a directly-elected ILEA inthe belief that xnost voters favour education policies similar to ours.     But wecannot be sure that sufficient voters holding those beliefs would turn out at anILEA election or that they would give expression to them rather than followparty lines.     Moreover, a directly-elected single service authority levying itsown precept or rate would have little or no incentive to economy.    As one ofmy colleagues put it, this would be equivalent to giving the glutton the key tothe larder door.    We could only avoid this by taking powers to controlexpenditure directly, a course which we advise against in paragraph 11 below.8. In my view, and that of most of the colleagues whom I have consulted,none of the alternatives to the status quo offers a sufficient proppect ofimproved educational performance and financial responsibility to justify thecontrover~y and disruption involved in bringing it about.FINANCIAL CONTROLS9. There is widespread concern about the reports of ILEA&apos;s provisionalspending plans for 1981-82.     But any control over this expenditure wouldrequire legislation.     My colleagues and I all judge that it would be impossibleto pass legislation in time for it to take effect in 1981-82, when we must rely onblock grant to bring home to the ratepayers the consequences of ILEA&apos;s actions2CONFIDENTIAL

An incidental result in that the grant that ILKA wH in 111 &lt;event lose - up to  70 million - \vi I! he red i st r i but ed to the gre.ll majority otother authorities.11. Looking beyond 1981-82,   my colleagues and I are all &lt; bar that weshould again reject,  as the Ministerial Committee on Kconomh   Strategy did Inthe summer,   proposals to limit dir.

II in by no means cot-tain that, bymaking an example of a small and untypical group &lt;&gt;l authorities,  we shouldsecure the compliance of the majority with our expenditure plans.     The resultwould be a severe blow to our relation!) with our supporters hi lo. .ilgove rnriient.1Z. There may however be ways of achieving our Idj.uk ial obje&lt; liven byindirect means either generally or in relation to ILEA alone.    The Secret*] yof State for the Environment will be circulating shortly a paper on themeasures that we might take generally in 1982-83 il our experience &lt;&gt;l the II ridyear of block grant shows that it is not working as we had hoped in son., areas,including ILK. A.     Two possibilities are di it. rent ial precepting by populationrather than rateable value above a certain threshold of expenditure and amaximum JevoJ oi precept on non-dome st! o  ratepayers gen. rally. Thetechnical problems associated with these options need further study.TIMING13. The Leader of li&lt;- Greater London Council, with whom I have discussedthe situation,  broadly endorses these vi&lt; ws on structure and finance.     lb- alsoagrees with me that it would be advantageous for us to announce our conclusions on the central, issue of the review as scon as possible.     Indeed, Ibelieve that we should make our announcement before LO February, when ILEAis due to approve its budget and precept tot next year.CONCLUSIONS14. My conclusions are-i.        There are no grounds for thinking that the break-up of ILEA orother less radical changes in its structure would bring any educationaladvantage s.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALii. There are no further steps we can take to control ii.kA&apos;sexpenditure in 1981-82.iii. We should makn it clear now tha&apos; if block grant tails to deterexcessive expenditure next year we shall take appropriate sti&apos;pn, eithergenerally or in relation to ILEA alone, to lim.t excessive expenditurethereafter.iv. We should make an early announcement.!15. If my colleagues accept these conclusions,   1 do not think that a GreenPaper would be appropriate.     The choice lies between a White Paper and anoral statemeat in both Houses of Parliament.     TIih announcement needs to befull enough to show why we have laboured so long, and to give our supportersin Parliament, ILEA and elsewhere,  some of whom may still Livimr theoptions we have rejected, the reasons why we have done BO. Timing(paragraph 13 above) points to an oral statement in both Houses, perhapssupplemented by explanatory material circulated in Mansard.M CDepartment of Education and Science19 January 19814CONFIDENTIAL
(confidential)81ILEA AND BLOCK GRANTAT present ILEA receives no grant itself, but precepts for all itsrevenue on the Inner London boroughs, a fact reflected in their grantentitlement.2. Under the old grant arrangements ILEA would have received  125m ingrant in 1981-82 on the assumptions that grant had been paid to each tier,that it was based on the expenditure projections used for block grant andthat the grant percentage had been maintained at 61 per cent.3. By comparison with this, the &quot;base position&quot; described in the RateSupport Grant Report which was approved by the House on 14 January, ILEA1agrant in 1981-82 will in fact total E70m if it holds its expenditure toabout E6COm.    This figure is derived from the Government&apos;s expendituretargets and inflation assumptions and is close in cash terms to ILEA&apos;Slikely expenditure in 1980-81, i.e in real terms it would mean a reductionof 10 percent between this year and next, compared with a reduction of 4 percent in the school population.4. The grant loss of E55m, the equivalent of a 5p rate (the loss limitprescribed by the relevant   safety net), would result from expenditure byILEA well in excess of its grant related expenditure  (GRE) of  468m as wellas from the reduction in the rate of grant from 61 per cent to 60 per centand from the general shift of grant away from London.    (GRE represents foreach local authority an attempt to relate spending need to the average costsof providing services for each client in need of them e.g schoolchildrenin the case of education, with adjustments to take account of factors whichclearly affect the cost of provision such as a widely scattered population or anexceptional concentration of social problems.)    But if, as reported, ILEAplans to spend some E700m in 1981-82  (i.e an increase of ElOOm compared with1980-81)&apos;, it will lose virtually all the remaining  70m of grant as well.Conversely, for every   less in expenditure below E700m the rate-payers also gain60p in grant.    This is because authorities like ILEA with very high rateableresources reach a point (through the operation of negative marginal rates ofgrant) where by applying the deemed rate poundage specified by the Government,they are required to finance all their expenditure from their own resources.5.
