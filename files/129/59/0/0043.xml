INTERNATIONALLABOUR CONFERENCE
There are set out below the decisions of Her Majesty&apos;s Government on twoConventions and four Recommendations adopted by the InternationalLabour Conference at its 34th Session in 1951, which it is proposed to com-municate to the Director-General of the International Labour Office. TheEnglish and French texts of these Recommendations were presented toParliament in Cmd. 8484.Convention (No. 99) concerning Minimum Wage Fixing Machinery inAgriculture.Recommendation (No. 89) concerning Minimum Wage Fixing machinery in Agriculture.Convention (No. 100) concerning Equal Remuneration for Men andWomen Workers for Work of Equal Value.Recommendation (No. 90) concerning Equal Remuneration for Men andWomen Workers for work of Equal Value.Recommendation (No. 91) concerning Collective Agreements.Recommendation   (No.   92)   concerning   Voluntary   Conciliation   and arbitration.Convention No. 99The Convention provides that ratifying States shall have machinery for the fixing of minimum rates of wages for workers employed in agriculture and related occupations. Provision is made, subject to safeguards, for the partialpayment of minimum wages in the form of allowances in kind where this iscustomary or desirable. It is left to ratifying States to decide for themselves the nature and form of the wage-fixing machinery, but the Convention lays down certain conditions which must be satisfied in regard to the following:consultation with organisations of employers and workers and with otherqualified persons before the machinery is set up; participation of employersand workers in the operation of the machinery; and the binding nature of therates of wages fixed. Provision is made, however, for abatement of theminimum rates - in the case of individuals who are physically or mentally handicapped. The Convention provides that minimum rates of wages in force must be made known to the employers and workers concerned, and providesfor their enforcement.The law and practice of the United Kingdom are in accordance with allthe requirements of the Convention and Her Majesty&apos;s Government proposeto ratify it.Recommendation No. 89The Recommendation contains provisions of a more detailed nature.These include: certain matters which should be taken into account in fixingminimum rates of wages; participation of employers and workers in the wage-fixing machinery; participation of employers and workers in the nomination ofany representatives they may have in the wage-fixing machinery; impartialityof independent persons appointed to participate in the wage-fixing machinery;periodical revision of the minimum rates of wages; publicity for the minimum rates; supervision of the rates actually paid, with penalties for infringements;343864 B 2
the appointment of inspectors; and the maintenance by employers of records of wages paid. As regards the matters to be taken into consideration in the fixing of minimum wage rates, dealt with in paragraphs 1 and 2 of theRecommendation, these are matters which, in the United Kingdom, are leftto the complete discretion of the Agricultural Wages Boards. In thesecircumstances, Her Majesty&apos;s Government do not desire to express an opinion in regard to the particular matters mentioned in these paragraphs, and cannot accept an obligation to specify factors which the Boards should take intoconsideration. Apart from this, the law and practice in the United kingdom are, in general, in conformity with the provisions of the Recommendation.Her Majesty&apos;s Government propose, therefore, subject to a reservation inrespect of paragraphs 1 and 2, to accept the Recommendation.Convention No. 100 and Recommendation No. 90The Convention lays down certain general principles in regard to equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value, which is defined as referring to &quot; rates of remuneration established without discrimina-tion based on sex.&quot; The central provisions of the Convention are containedin Article 2, which provides that each member shall, by means appropriate to the methods in operation for determining rates of remuneration, promote and, in so far as is consistent with such methods, ensure the application toall workers of the principle of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value. This Article also sets out the variousmeans by which the principle may be applied. Other Articles of theConvention provide that, where such action would assist in giving effect tothe provisions of the Convention, measures shall be taken to promote objectiveappraisal of jobs on the basis of the work to be performed, and that thereshall be co-operation, as appropriate, between Governments and employers&apos;and workers&apos; organisations concerned for the purpose of giving effect to theprovisions of the Convention.The Recommendation sets out procedures for the progressive applicationof the general principles laid down in the Convention. It is provided in the preamble to the Recommendation that these measures should be appliedsubject to the provisions of Article 2 of the Convention.Her Majesty&apos;s Government have accepted the general principle of equal pay in relation to their own employees, and intend to give effect to it as soonas the economic and financial circumstances of the country make it possibleto do so. The wider obligations envisaged in the Convention and Recom-mendation will require careful consideration, but until conditions are such asto enable Her Majesty&apos;s Government to proceed with the introduction of equal pay in the Government Service, it is necessary to defer a decision with regardto these instruments.Recommendation No. 91Paragraph 1 of the Recommendation provides that machinery appropriate to the conditions in each country should be established, by means of agree-ment or laws or regulations, to negotiate collective agreements, or to assistthe parties in the negotiation of such agreements. Paragraph 2 defines the term &quot; collective agreements&quot; for the purposes of the Recommendation.Paragraph 3 provides that collective agreements should bind both the signatories, and those on whose behalf the agreements are concluded;employers and workers should not be able to include in contracts of employ-ment stipulations contrary to the collective agreement, and any such stipula-tions should be regarded as null and void; terms and conditions morefavourable to the workers than those provided for in the collective agreement
should not be regarded as contrary to it. Paragraph 4 deals with theapplication of collective agreements to all workers of the classes concernedemployed in the undertakings covered by the agreement. Paragraph 5provides for measures to be taken, where appropriate, for the extension of collective agreements to all employers and workers included within theindustrial and territorial scope of the agreements. Paragraph 6 provides thatdisputes arising out of the interpretation of agreements should be submittedto the appropriate procedure for settlement established either by agreementbetween the parties, or by laws and regulations, as may be appropriate under national conditions. Paragraph 7 provides that the application of collective agreements should be ensured by the employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations concerned or by bodies existing in each country for this purpose, or bybodies established ad hoc. Paragraph 8 provides that national laws or regulations may make provision for requiring employers to bring the texts of collective agreements to the notice of the workers concerned, for the registration or deposit of collective agreements, and for the minimum period during which collective agreements shall be deemed to be binding.Her Majesty&apos;s Government do not propose to introduce legislation on anyof the matters covered by this Recommendation. Machinery to assist theparties in the negotiation, conclusion, revision and renewal of collective agreements (paragraph 1) is already available. The Government are notcontemplating any action regarding the extension of collective agreements(paragraph 5), or relating to the provisions contained in paragraph 8.As regards those aspects of collective agreements which are dealt with inparagraphs 3, 4, and 7 of the Recommendation, Her Majesty&apos;s government regard these as the proper responsibility of the parties to collective agree-ments. While, to the extent indicated below, they embody certain principleswith which Her Majesty&quot;s Government, for their part, are generally in accord,they also envisage the possibility of intervention by the Government of a kind which could not be regarded as in accordance with our system ofindustrial relations. As regards paragraphs 3 and 7, it is a generally acceptedprinciple in this country that collective agreements should be effectivelyobserved, and that the responsibility for securing such observance should rest with the parties. In so far, however, as these paragraphs are calculated toplace an ultimate responsibility upon the Government in these matters, theycould not be regarded by Her Majesty&apos;&apos;s Government as appropriate for application in the United Kingdom. Similar considerations apply in the caseof paragraph 4, the provisions of which are commonly applied in the UnitedKingdom.As regards paragraph 6, Her Majesty&apos;s Government agree as to thedesirability of disputes arising from the interpretation of collective agreementsbeing settled in accordance with a procedure agreed between the parties. Itwould not be appropriate to national conditions in this country to make provision under national laws or regulations for the reference of such disputesto a compulsory procedure where voluntary machinery is available for thesettlement of the dispute and full use has not been made of that machinery in an endeavour to obtain a settlement.Subject to the above points, Her Majesty&apos;s Government regard theRecommendation as generally acceptable.Recommendation No. 92The Recommendation provides that voluntary conciliation machineryappropriate to national conditions should be made available to assist in theprevention and settlement of industrial disputes between employers and workers.   The procedure should be free of charge and expeditious, and
provision should be made for it to be set in motion either by any of theparties to the dispute or ex officio by the voluntary conciliation authority.The parties in a dispute should be encouraged to refrain from strikes andlockouts while the conciliation procedure is in progress. The Recommenda-tion further provides that, where a dispute has been submitted to arbitrationfor final settlement with the consent of all parties, the parties should be encouraged to refrain from strikes and lockouts while the arbitration is inprogress, and to accept the arbitration award. The Recommendation statesthat its provisions are not to be interpreted as limiting in any way the rightto strike.The law and practice of the United Kingdom are in conformity with theprovisions of the Recommendation and Her Majesty&apos;s Government propose,therefore, to accept it.
