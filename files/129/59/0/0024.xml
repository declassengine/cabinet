Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1953Copy No.   6 3CABINETHOUSING SUBSIDIESMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local government there is a good deal of confusion about housing subsidies. For instance, Inotice that at a Cabinet on 10th February (when I was away) one of my colleaguessaid, &quot;Were the Government justified in spending  61 millions a year in subsidisingrents for people who were often able to afford motor cars and television sets? &quot;(C.C. (53) 8th Conclusions, Minute 3).2. But housing subsidies are not like food subsidies, a matter which theGovernment can, at its own discretion, reduce or abolish. With minor exceptions(mostly for the benefit of agriculture) they are not payable to individuals but tolocal authorities, housing associations and New Towns. Under statutes going backto 1919 and payable for different periods under the various Acts, they representthe Central Government^ annual share of the liability, in partnership with thelocal housing agency, for the houses which have been built. It was part of thearrangement that the management and repair of the houses and fixing of the rentswas left entirely to the local housing agency. These subsidies could not now berepudiated except by legislation, involving a gross breach of faith.3. The total Housing Vote (including Supplementaries) for 1952-53 is 64 millions for Great Britain made up in this way A. Subsidies on Permanent Housing  millions(1) 1919-1939 .........      ......      14i(2) 1945-1953 ...............      22-   36iB. Other Items(3) Temporary Houses (pre-fabs).........      214-(4) Requisitioned Houses   ...      .........       5-J(5) Miscellaneous Items     ............        i-   27iGrand Total        .............. 644. The subsidies on permanent housing are for limited terms. Some of those under the Addison Act of 1919 have already gone; most of those under theChamberlain Act of 1923 were for twenty years and have disappeared; those under the Wheatley Act of 1924 were for forty years and will begin to&apos; drop out inthe nineteen sixties.  Those under the current legislation are for sixty years.5. The provision under &quot; Other Items &quot; includes the cost of requisitioning.This is an unhappy inheritance of the war and everything possible is being done toget rid of it. The quickest practicable way to get rid of it is by building more houses.The item for temporary housing represents the amortisation charge by way of ten-year annuity to extinguish a capital expense which was met out of the con-solidated fund. Its rapid fall in the latter part of this decade will provide a sub-stantial relief to the Votes.43809CONFIDENTIALC. (53) 7427 th February, 1953
6. The only practicable sphere in which cuts could be made in housing subsidies is in the annual addition in respect of new houses built. But any reduction of subsidy could only properly be made to apply to new houses authorisedafter the date of the announcement. At the moment we have in Great Britain326,300 subsidised houses in tenders approved but not yet completed. All thesemust draw a subsidy at the rate agreed when they began. It will be seen that,desirable as it may be to reduce subsidies, it cannot have any appreciable immediate effect except by default upon contractual liabilities.H. M.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.W. 1,27th February, 1953.
