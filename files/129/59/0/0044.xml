confidential.(53) 949TH MARCH, 1953CABINETTEACHERS&apos; SUPERANNUATIONNote by the Financial Secretary, treasury in C. (53) 86 the Paymaster-General says:&quot;The calculations, on arguable assumptions, are socomplex that not even a mathematics teacher   willbe able to follow them without a great deal of study.But everybody, will readily understand that we are to-day collecting  10 millions more per year than isbeing paid out in pensions. &quot;2.        I am not a teacher of mathematics, but I am afraid that I cannot accept the figure of  10 millions.    It is true that we are at present collectingmore in contributions than we are paying out in contributory (i. e. post-1922)pensions.    But when the pre-1922 pensions are taken into account, our jotalexpenditure on teachers&apos; pensions exceeds the contribution income, exceptin 1952/53, as the following table shows:Teachers&apos; Pensions(England and Wales)S, millions		2	3	,4	5,	Income from pension con-tributions	Expenditure in contri-butory pensions	Excess of income over expenditure (1-2)	Total expendi-ture on pensions	Excess of expenditure over income (4-1)1943/49	10.679	5.966	4.713	11.832	1.1531949/50	11.452	6.909	4.543	13.073	1.6211950/51	11.452	7.832	3.620	14.270	2.8181951/52	14.233	8.043	6.190	i 14.316	.O831952/53	15.680	8.774	6.906	15.392	Excess of incoios over expenditure .2881953/54	16.420	9.732	6.688	116.780	.363COPY NO.6^
hoThese figures ignore the substantial additional sums which the Exchequer hasto find for teachers under the three Pensions Increase Acts.    The cost of thiswas  1. 75 millions in 1951/52 and will be substantially more in 1952/53.3.       Since 1925/26 when the Teachers1 Superannuation Account was set up,teachers1 pensions have been dealt with as a whole, i. e. pre-1922 (non-contributory) and post-1922 (contributory) pensions together.4.       But all this is far from the whole story.    There is a world of difference between the cash position as reflected in the Education Estimatesthis year or next and the actuarial solvency of the scheme which can only be judged on a long-term basis.    We are making a &quot;profit&quot; now on the contribu-tory pensions (though not on teachers&apos; pensions as a whole), but as time goes on that &quot;profit&quot; will disappear and we shall begin to spend more and more on pensions than we shall be getting in through contributions, unless the rate of contribution is raised.    The present value of the amounts by which futurepensions will exceed future contributions at the present contribution of10 per cent is no less than  188 millions for teachers now in service.    Thatis the additional sum which the Education Votes will have to provide in futureover the years if the contribution rate is not raised, i. e. future pensions will exceed future contributions by that amount.    If the contribution rate is raised to 12 per cent, we shall still have to find  119 millions, while the teachers andthe local education authorities will have to find  69 millions.    The Chancellorof the Exchequer felt that he was going as far as he could to help in solving theproblem by agreeing to impose a burden of  119 millions on the general body of future taxpayers - a burden which will benefit one section of the communityonly, and will in effect heavily subsidise teachers1 pensions from general taxation.J.A.B.-C.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.9TH MARCH, 1953.
