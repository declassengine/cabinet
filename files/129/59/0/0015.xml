In the second half of the 20th century we cannot hope to maintain our position in the Middle East by the methods of the last century.   Howeverlittle we like it, we must face that fact.   Commercial concessions whose localbenefit appears to redound mainly to the Shahs and Pashas no longer serve in the same way to strengthen our influence in these countries, and they comeincreasingly under attack by local nationalist opinion.   Military occupationcould be maintained by force, but in the case of Egypt the base upon which it depends is of little use if there is no local labour to man it.   We have learnedthe first lesson in Persia:  we are learning the second in Egypt.3. In most of the countries of the Middle East the social and economicaspirations of the common people are quickening and the tide of nationalism isrising fast.   If we are to maintain our influence in this area, future policy mustbe designed to harness these movements rather than to struggle against them.4. Our strategic purposes in the Middle East can no longer be served by arrangements which local nationalism will regard as military occupation by foreign troops.   It is immaterial from what country those troops come.   Itwould be a delusion to suppose that, in Egypt or elsewhere in the Middle East,local opinion would tolerate occupation by American or French forces any more readily than the Egyptians tolerate the British garrison on the Canal.5. Our strategic interests in this area must in future be served by arrangements designed to enable its peoples to play a significant, if not a principal, part in its defence.   They must at least appear to have a determiningvoice in the disposition of the defence forces for the area.   But, if that principle is conceded, they may accept the assistance of ourselves, the americans and the leading Powers of Western Europe in organising and equipping their own forces;  and they may also be willing that the defence of the whole area shallbe organised in association with those Powers.6. This was the basis of the Four-Power approach to Egypt.   Thatwas not a plan to substitute for the British occupation a military occupation by an international force.   It was a plan for establishing a Middle East defence organisation (M.E,D.O.) in which Egypt and the other countries of the Middle east would be associated with ourselves, the Americans, the French, the Turks and the
Commonwealth countries concerned in planning and organising the defence of theMiddle East as a whole.   In the early stages the Middle East Command was tobe no more than a planning organisation.   The Supreme Allied Commanderwould not have power to station forces in any Middle Eastern country withoutits consent.7. In the defence negotiations with the Egyptians, our main aim hasbeen to secure their agreement to entering into a Middle East Defence organisation on that basis.   Our offer to withdraw British troops from the Canal Zone has beenconditional upon their agreeing to enter into such an Organisation.   And we have throughout intended that our withdrawal should keep in step with the developmentof this new international defence organisation.8, We have at no time contemplated withdrawal under duress.   nor have we been willing to promise withdrawal unconditionally.   It has been ourposition throughout that we will withdraw our troops only when there is areasonable prospect that other satisfactory arrangements will be made,on an international basis for securing the free use of the Suez Canal, planning the defence of the Middle East, and ensuring the use of the military base inEgypt in a future v/ar.9. What other course could we follow?   Could we stand on our rights under the 193 6 Treaty?   We may reproach Egypt for her unilateral renunciation of the Treaty.   But let us not forget that we are ourselves in serious breach of it.It allows us to maintain not more than 10,000 troops in Egypt in time of peace:since 193 6 we have rarely had so few there, and we now have nearer 80,000.Moreover, the Treaty expires at the end of 1956, and it will take at least 18 months to complete the withdrawal of our troops.   Even if we decide to hang on untilthe Treaty expires, withdrawal will have to begin in two years&apos; time.   Thus, apolicy of standing on the Treaty would be shaky in the present and barren for thefuture. N10. We could undoubtedly deal effectively with any immediate attempt by the Egyptians to eject us by force from the Canal Zone,   But the situationwhich this would create would almost certainly compel us to re-occupy Egypt, withall the consequences which this would entail.   We should be likely to have world opinion against us and would find it difficult to make a case if Egypt took usto the United Nations.   It is hard to see what future there is for such a policy.We cannot afford to keep 80,000 men indefinitely in the Canal Zone.   Already our overseas current expenditure - mainly military - has risen from  160 millions in1950 to  222 millions (provisional estimate) in 1952.   This does not include thelocal cost of our troops in Germany which, as the Cabinet know, may bring usan additional liability of up to  80 millions in coming years.11. With our limited resources, it is essential that we should concentrate onthe points where our vital strategic needs or the necessities of our economic lifeare at stake and that we should utilise our strength in the most economical way.It is not possible for our present forces in the Canal Zone to support our peace-timeinterests elsewhere in the Middle East.   If we leave them there in defiance of the Egyptians they will be wholly absorbed in coping with the situation which their very presence creates.12, For these reasons I believe that the defence of our strategic and commercial interests in the Middle East can best be served through an agreementwith the Egyptian Government on the lines proposed in my paper (C,(53) 17  Revise )0A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.16th February, 1953,
