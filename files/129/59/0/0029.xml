(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL28TH FEBRUARY.  1955CABINETAGRICULTURAL REVIEW.  1955Memorandum by Minister off Agriculture and FisheriesNext week, our officials are to begin with the representa-tives of the National Farmers&apos; Unions (N.F.U&apos;s) the statutoryreview of the economic position of the agricultural industry.In the light of these discussions, the prices of agricultural products which are the subject of guarantees of price and market are determined for the next period,2,      I regret that I have been unable to reach agreement with my colleagues on the extent to which farmers should haverecouped to them the increases in costs of production whichhave occurred during the last twelve months.    This differenceresolves itself in practice into a disagreement on the price which the Ministry of Food should pay the producers for milk.Background to the Discussions3.      It is essential that my colleagues should fully appreciate the background of farming opinion against which these discussions will proceed.    Farmers have been told (they heardit last from the Prime Minister himself) that the government intend to introduce a new system for determining income underwhich the present Ministry of Food fixed prices will largelydisappear and free markets will be oombined with stability.h.     There is great suspicion of these changes.    Farmersremember the repeal of the Corn Production Act, 1921, and manyof them fear that the Government will use the opportunity ofa change of system to withdraw the support which they haveenjoyed under the fixed prices since 19h-0,    They are accordinglyregarding the outcome of the forthcoming Annual Review withspecial interest and will treat it as a sign of the governments intentions,    Uur objective must therefore be to produce aresult which v/e hope the N,F.U&apos;s leaders will recommend hutwhich in any case the ordinary farmer will accept as fair.If he infers from the result of the Annual Review that theGovernment are &quot;getting out from under&quot;, confidence will disappear, expansion will cease and we shall be told that thePrime Minister&apos;s assertion that we must &quot;wring the last ounceof food from our acres&quot; is an empty phrase.COPY NO.
/ass5.      In short, in 1953 we are conducting two operations.    Weare seeking to introduce a new economic system for agriculturecombining freedom with stability;    and during the forthcoming discussions we shall seek to reduce current margins of profit, by way of under-recoupment of increased costs, on some commodities to which the farmers attach great importance.To achieve the first in reasonable agreement *with the farmerswill if we succeed be a great operation in itself;    for we propose in the course of the year to introduce new free marketsystems for cereals, eggs and potatoes (although maintaining the war-time controls over milk against the wishes of mostfarmers).    We cannot,  therefore, press too hard on profit margins if we want to avoid a complete loss of confidencewith all its economic and political consequences.6.     I have agreed with my colleagues to insist on thefollowing(a) No increase in the support price for cereals.(b) A significant under-recoupment of the increased costs of pig raising./(c) A reduction in the price of wool.(d) A level of support price for eggs, which we know will meet with hostility.It is a delusion to think that farmers will take any of these things easily, even though there is good ground for believing that in the immediate future their returns from eggs and wheat will be higher than in the past.    But in addition, mycolleagues are pressing that we should insist on a seriousunder-recoupment of the increased costs of producing milk.The General Case for Full Recoupment7,      In my view there is a very strong case for full recoup-ment this year on its own merits.    To achieve the expansion,particularly of meat production, which we have set beforethem farmers will have to increase their working capital orstock in trade very considerably.   Although in the end theirreceipts should correspondingly increase, they will not havea large part of these increased receipts in the next year ortwo during which the increased numbers of calves are beingreared and fattened.8.      The farmers are indeed likely to press for a &quot;oapitalinjection&quot; in addition to full recoupment on the ground that without new money adequate expansion is impossible.    I shallreject this;   but it cannot be denied that additional farmingcapital is required.
9.     I recognise the argument that the industry should heincreasing its efficiency (as it is doing steadily) and thatthe consumer or taxpayer ought to have some share in the resulting benefit.    But it seems to me most impolitic toenforce the application of this principle this year.    Mydifference with some of my colleagues arises on this point and is concentrated on the case of milk.Milk Price10.    Before considering this price itself, my colleagues should realise the immense importance of milk to farmers -and particularly those in England and Wales.    Milk is themost important single commodity produced on British farms,and for fully a third of all the farms it is the main source of income.11.   Although I have argued for full recoupment overall, Ihave not proposed full recoupment in the case of milk whichwould increase prices by 0.82d. per gallon.    I have proposedfd. a gallon which is rather below full recoupment.    TheMinister of Pood is reluctant to go above 4^d. a gallon.V2..    If. however, my colleagues think that the milk producerunreasonable.    I do not see how we could&apos; ask for more than half of a reasonable estimate of the possible increase inefficiency.    This has been calculated at about V5 d.    On this basis, the least increase in price which we could justify isfd. a gallon.    It is not possible to claim great accuracy forthese figures.    But we must have some reasoned basis for under-recoupment if we are to retain the confidence and co-operationof the- farmers.13.    I would ask my colleagues to consider how any greaterunder-recoupment of increased costs could be defended to the milk producer.    If we say that neither the Exchequer nor theconsumer can bear the increased cost above 4;d. a gallon, weshall in effect be asking the milk producer to accept apermanent reduction in his standards of living in order to spare the taxpayer or consumer such a reduction.    The only possible argument is that the Government fear that themaintenance of the existing profit margin-will produce too much milk.    In the light.of the Prime Minister&apos;s speech arewe really prepared to say this?C onclusion1h.   We must consider this issue in the light of the farmers&apos;present state of mind and the arguments that we can use tojustify any proposals that we put forward.    It would be useless to propose an Increase of less than 4/d. a gallon.   Anythingless would create the worst impression and, in my view, would gravely prejudice the prospects of an amicable issue to thediscussions.    I am ready to try to stop at an increase of -g-d.a gallon, but I do not believe it will be possible to achieve this and other difficult objectives that I have indicated,except at the cost of a rupture.15.    I ask, therefore, for authority to go up to fd.;   but Iam bound to warn my colleagues that there is a real risk ofa rejection of our proposals by the farmers unless we can go up to fd.
16.    I understand that if the proposal of fd. increase per gallon is accepted retail liquid milk prices would have tohe increased &quot;by -g-d. a pint for 10-g- weeks to recover the costIf the Minister of Food&apos;s proposal to give only ^d.  is imposed retail prices would have to &quot;be increased &quot;by -g-d.  apint for JLjL-g- weeks:    a difference of -g-d. a pint for 6 weeks.On the other hand the difference of fd. a gallon means thatthe milk producers would get  3 millions less under theMinister of Food&apos;s proposal than under mine.(Intld.)
