GOVERNMENT RECEPTIONIt is proposed that a reception should be held at the national gallery on 30th May and that the hosts for the 2,000 guests shouldbe the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary, the Chancellor of theExchequer, and the Secretaries of State for Commonwealth relations and the Colonies.2,   A second reception is down on the Programme for Tuesday,9th June.    In view of the number of entertainments now arranged,including garden parties at Hatfield House and Blenheim Palace, and because by 9th June most of the foreign visitors will have departed,the Committee on Coronation Preparations considered that thisreception should be eliminated from the Programme.
1.       The following table shows the arrangements which I am making throughmy Department and the Government Hospitality Fund to provide catering on theday of the Coronation and the estimated cost to the Ministry of Works Corona-tion Vote.Estimated Cost to Ministry of Works Coronation Vote		Category	Refresh-ment	CommentsAccommo-dation and Services	Catering		Provided	  200	  260	(1)  Those in the Procession from the Abbey (260 persons)	Buffet	Wines will be provided by Government Hospitality Fund Fund530		(2)  Heads of special missions (375 persons)	Lunch	Cost of services will be borne on the Ministry of Works Coronation Vote, that of Refreshment on the Government Hospitality Fund		(3)   Junior members of special missions (150 persons)	Buffet	Cost borne by Government Hospitality Fund36O		(4)  Senior members of the Diplomatic Corps (140 persons)	Buffet	Cost of services borne on Ministry of Works Corona-tion Vote, catering on Government Hospitality Fund1,100		(5)  Members of Lords and Commons	Buffet	The figure of  1,100 represents (a)  500 towards the cost of temporary lavatories for both Houses, and (b)  600 towards the cost of an awning over the terrace for the House of Commons luncheon2,750	6,000	(6)   Other Abbey guests (5,250 persons)	Buffet	Includes the provision of beer, spirits and white wine cup4,9^0	6,260	Total for Abbey guests		7,ooo	-	(7)  Stand seat holders	Buffet	Includes provision of marquees and all main services.

2.       By agreement with the Lord Chamberlain the members of the ForeignMissions who will not go into the Abbey will have seats in the Mall opposite Lancaster IHouse.    A buffet lunch will be provided on the ground floor of Lancaster House, andthe cost carried on the Government Hospitality Vote.3.       Item 1 in the table will be borne by the Ministry of Works1 Coronation Vote,and the catering cost of Items 2 to 4 by  the Government Hospitality Fund.    I was invited to seek the Cabinet&apos;s approval to provide at public expense Items 5 and 6.The arrangement under Item 5 is in place of providing lunch for Members ofboth Houses at public expense.    It is, in effect, a subsidy of less per head than willbe spent on the other Abbey guests.    It has the advantage of spreading the subsidyover all Members whether they are in the Abbey or not, and it avoids the difficultyof catering for more guests in Westminster Hall than can conveniently be accommo-dated, since all Members and their friends will go, as previously arranged, either tothe Royal Gallery or to the Terrace.4.       Seat holders on Government stands have been told that they will be able toobtain refreshments subject to payment.    The Committee on Coronation Preparationsinvited me to find caterers prepared to provide catering without charge to public funds.    It is now clear that such caterers cannot be found and I seek the cabinet&apos;s approval to provide the necessary accommodation and services, such as gas and water, for caterers on Government stands at a cost of  7,000. j5.       I propose to offer no objection to caterers on stands on the route and in theRoyal Parks seeking occasional licences to sell beer between the hours of noon and5 p.m. on Coronation day.    Unless these licences are granted it is unlikely thatsuitable caterers will come forward.    But if beer can be sold I shall hope toarrange for a percentage of gross takings to be paid to the Ministry of Works.
APPENDIX IKMINISTRY OF WORKS expenditure .

2.       The increase in the cost of preparing Westminster Abbey is mainly due to -(a) extra covered ways for the dispersal of guests;(b) extra medical and press facilities;(c) the increase in building wages.3.       My original estimate for the Annexe was  67,000 (about  8,000 less than in1937 at 1953 prices).    I cut this to  50,000.    I now find I need  53,000.    Theadditional  3,000 is for -(a) increased wages -    1,000(b) perspex canopy -    1,000(c) roofing, internal walltreatment, etc. -    1,0004.      The Cabinet approved the prices of  6 and  4 for seats in stands, and at thetime I said that the latest tenders showed that these figures would not cover the whole cost.Since then the route has been lengthened so that there is a stand on SpeakersGreen; and a stand at Apsley House was not included in the earlier estimate.Unfortunately, in spite of economies in design, the later tendering costs areeven higher than expected, and the wage increase adds to the cost of all stands.Taking credit for the free seats to Members of both House, and to the diplomatic corps, etc., the Iocs per seat sold is about 11s. Od.5.      The other changes in my budget are small and due to alterations in thearrangements made as the programme was worked out.    There are still a fewtenders to come in but I hope they will not materially change the total estimate now submitted.
