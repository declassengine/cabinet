Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1953SECRET Copy No.C. (53) 549th February, 19536CABINETFUTURE OF THE MINISTRY OF pensions memorandum by the Chancellor of the &quot;Exchequer *In response to my appeal for economies in Government expenditure, theMinister of Pensions has suggested to me that the time has now come when hisMinistry might be amalgamated, for the major part with the Ministry of national insurance, but also in part with the Ministry of Health and the Department ofHealth for Scotland. I have discussed the suggestion with him and with theMinisters of National Insurance and Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland,and we are all agreed in recommending that the suggestion should be adopted.2. The Case for a Change(a) The Ministry of Pensions (excluding the hospitals and the other medical treatment services) and the Ministry of National Insurance (on theIndustrial Injuries side) do essentially the same job for service casualties and for victims of industrial accidents respectively; and it is desirablethat there should be close integration of policy covering the award ofpension to&apos; both these classes. Although the protagonists of disabled ex-servicemen claim that such men should have preferential treatmentover disabled civilians, the experience since the war has been that majorincreases in the pensions and allowances of war or industrial injurypensioners have, in fact, been applied equally to both classes.(b) An amalgamation of the Ministries of Pensions and National Insurancewould enable the considerable medical staffs now engaged in bothMinistries on the assessment, for pension purposes, of injuries receivedrespectively by war pensioners and industrially-injured civilians to bemore closely integrated than at present, with consequent economy in medical staff.(c) Now that the National Insurance Schemes have been launched and theimmediate post-war problems of the Ministry of Pensions are being left behind, it is doubtful whether there is a really full load of work in either Department at the highest levels. Both at those levels and lowersome worthwhile economies would be secured by amalgamation. Itis not practicable to put a figure on this, but, taking the administrative costs of the Ministry of Pensions at about  4 millions a year,: it is thoughtthat perhaps a&apos; quarter of this sum might be saved not immediately,but over a few years by amalgamation.(d) If no new major war breaks out, the work of the Ministry of Pensions willcontract year by year. If it remains a separate entity in these circum-stances, it will become difficult to sustain morale, efficiency and economy in it. The more energetic and able people will try to- leave and, so faras they fail in this, will look about to make work for themselves.(e) The introduction of the National Health Service has raised the questionwhether there would not be some economy and other advantages? inthe integration of the Ministry of Pensions medical establishments with43692
that Service, especially as the number of war patients has fortunatelynow dropped to a comparatively small figure.3. The Nature of the SchemeNo detailed scheme has been drawn up in advance of a decision in principle.But it is clear that no major difficulties other than those mentioned below arelikely to be met. In outline what is suggested is that (a) All the work of the Ministry of Pensions relating to the awarding and payment of pensions and allowances (including the organisation of medical boarding) would be transferred to the Ministry of national insurance, where it would be integrated for administrative purposes withthe industrial work. It might be thought desirable for political reasons to appoint an additional Parliamentary Secretary to the combinedMinistry.(b) Work of the Ministry of Pensions which involves treatment, i.e., the running of hospitals, rehabilitation centres, and the artificial limb and otherappliances services, would be transferred to the Ministry of Health(or, in appropriate cases to the Department of Health for Scotland).There are at present 12 hospitals and ancillary medical establishmentswhich are run by the Ministry of Pensions. While, in the view of theMinistry of Health, it would be highly desirable to bring these into the wider general framework of the main hospital services, it would nodoubt be politic for a time at least to devise special arrangements toensure that any existing advantages, enjoyed by war pensioners in thesehospitals would continue.The Objections4. The difficulties are, of course, political. The British Legion and similarbodies will no doubt oppose these plans on the ground that the Government will no longer be able to give to war pensioners the special care which they merit andwhich they now have. Ever since the first world war they have had a Minister anda Department with no preoccupations other than that of looking after their interests a Department which has not only administered to their financial needs and general welfare, but has been organised to give them medical treatment also.Now they will become (they will say) a subsidiary interest of other Ministers and departments which have other much larger preoccupations. On the other hand,powerful interests, such as the Trades Union Congress, might be attracted by theidea of war pensioners and industrially injured civilians being treated alike.5. How strongly these arguments will be pressed, no one can say. But theycan be met in some degree -(a) if the reorganisation can be presented as part of a^number of plans arisingfrom an overhaul of the Government machine. It might therefore bevery helpful if any announcement could cover other proposals ofthis kind;(b) if the transfer to the Ministry of National Insurance is represented as an amalgamation -not as the swallowing up of a small Department by abig one. This would be. assisted by assigning a new title to the combinedDepartment;(c) if the existing strong Central Advisory Council on war pensions, of whichthe Minister is Chairman, is retained and, if possible, strengthened;(d) if any existing advantages for war pensioners in the present Ministry ofPensions hospitals are continued-in which event it can be held that thewar pensioners will gain rather than lose because the Health Ministers,when they become responsible for their treatment, will be able to callon the facilities of the whole national service to ensure that necessarytreatment is given by the hospital best able to provide it. :6. If these suggestions commend themselves, it may be possible before a finaldecision is taken to take soundings among Government supporters or even in theBritish Legion to test the strength of the opposition which they will cause. Thisis a matter on which the Ministers concerned have not yet formed a definite view.But we are all agreed that it is most important that the matter should be
treated with the utmost secrecy until the Government have reached at any rate a provisional conclusion. The staffs concerned are naturally on the look-out forindications that proposals of this sort are being examined; and if the plans were tobecome known prematurely, strong agitation might develop in the House ofCommons or elsewhere before the Government were in a position to answer questions or to express a view.7. The Prime Minister, having been informed of our suggestion, has asked that it should be considered by the Cabinet.R. A. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,9th February, 1953.
