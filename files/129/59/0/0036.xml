confidential.(53) 862ND MARCH, 1953CABINETTEACHERS&apos; SUPERANNUATIONNote by the Paymaster-GeneralThe proposal to ask the teachers to pay one-fifth more than theyare paying to-day towards their pensions seems to me unwise.    It amountsto an attempt to make those entering the profession to-day pay more becausethe Actuaries consider a deficit has been incurred in respect of their fore-runners.The calculations, on arguable assumptions, are so complex that not even a mathematics teacher will be able to follow them without a greatdeal of study.    But everybody will readily understand that we are to-daycollecting  10 millions more per year than is being paid out in pensions.Politically it seems to me a mistake to touch off demands for higher salary scales and risk a great deal of political odium for the sake of balancing a notional account in the distant future.COPY NO.Paymaster-General&apos;s Office, S.W.1.2ND MARCH, 1953.
