PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES FOR A EUROPEAN NUCLEARRESEARCH organisation memorandum by the Minister of state the Cabinet asked the Foreign Secretary to give them early notice of any new-proposal to extend privileges and immunities to an international organisation(C.C. (52) 75th Conclusions, Minute 6).A proposal has now been made to establish an inter-governmental EuropeanOrganisation for Nuclear Research which would be a permanent body to engage in &quot;fundamental&quot; research into the behaviour of high-energy particles. An interimbody, the European Council for Nuclear Research, was set up a year ago. We didnot join this, but our scientists, official and unofficial, took part informally inelaborating its plans.On 22nd December, 1952, the Lord President of the Council recommendedthat Her Majesty&apos;s Government should join the proposed Organisation, providedthat the Convention which established it set acceptable limits to its functions andto the financial commitments of the Member States, because under such conditions it was an economical way of organising essential research work and would permitus to co-operate with and give a lead to European science. The Chancellor of theExchequer and the Foreign Secretary agreed. Accordingly, at a meeting of theEuropean Council for Nuclear Research held at Brussels from 12th to 14th January,.Sir Ben Lockspeiser announced the readiness of Her Majesty&apos;s Government inprinciple to join the proposed Organisation provided that necessary safeguards were accepted and embodied in the Convention.If an otherwise acceptable Convention can be drafted, it seems probable thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government will be asked to accept a clause providing for the-proposed Organisation to negotiate separately with each Member Government onthe subject of the privileges and immunities to be accorded to the Organisation andpossibly its staff. The relevant Article (drafted by a Foreign Office Legal Adviser)reads as follows:  &quot; The Organisation shall have. legal personality in the metropolitan territories of all Member States; and the Organisation and representatives of member States on the Council, and the members of Committees and of othersubordinate bodies established under paragraph 1 of Article V of thisConvention, and members of the staff of the Organisation shall be accorded,in the metropolitan territories of Member States, by virtue of Agreements tobe concluded between the Council and each Member State concerned, suchprivileges and immunities as they agree to be necessary fof the exercise ofthe functions of the Organisation.&quot;There is provision elsewhere in the Convention to ensure that the ordinary laws of Member States relating to the movement of persons, and to security, are not affected.It is not yet clear what immunities, if any, will be required in the UnitedKingdom, since the Organisation^ headquarters are to be in Geneva. The Organi-sation will probably have facilities for using the cyclotron at Liverpool, and similarresearch facilities at other United Kingdom universities, but there seems to be noreason why it should need privileges and immunities for research workers.43859Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1953CONFIDENTIAL Copy No-     7 0C. (53) 875th March, 1953CABINET
If the Organisation were to ask for a privilege or immunity that we were not disposed to grant, we should, if the draft article above were to be accepted, havethe right to maintain that such a privilege or immunity was not necessary for theexercise of the functions of the Organisation.I recommend, therefore, that the Cabinet take note of the fact that negotiations are in progress for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to take part in the European NuclearResearch Organisation, if it is established.S. L.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,5th March, 1953.
