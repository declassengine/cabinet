Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1953Copy No.cabinet mr. EDGAR SANDERS AND LEE MENGMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies on 22nd January the Cabinet agreed that, if suitable arrangements could bemade, it would be advantageous to accept the Hungarian offer to exchangeMr. Sanders (a British subject serving a long sentence of imprisonment in Hungaryon a charge of espionage) with a Chinese woman terrorist named Lee ment whois under sentence of death in Malaya for being in unlawful possession of arms(C.C. (53) 4th Conclusions, Minute 7). I said that, if satisfactory assurances ofMr. Sanders&apos;s release were given, I would be prepared to press the Malayanauthorities to arrange for the release of Lee ment. The Cabinet accordinglydirected the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and myself to concert the action necessary for the exchange and it was agreed that I should consult the Malayanauthorities. I accordingly sent a telegram to the High Commissioner for theFederation of Malaya, explaining the proposal to him and seeking his views upon it.2. The High Commissioner has replied that such a transaction would havemost serious political consequences in Malaya. A copy of his telegram No. 82is attached (Appendix I). I attach great weight to it. The Commissioner-general has also reported that both he and the Governor of Singapore are strongly opposedto the proposal.3. H.M. Ambassador at Budapest recognises the force of these objectionsbut suggests that it might still be possible to proceed with the exchange,particularly (a) if Lee ment&apos;s appeal to the Privy Council is successful, or(b) if the death sentence is commuted.These suggestions have been conveyed to the High Commissioner. He is stillopposed to the exchange but agrees that some of his objections would lose their force if the appeal were successful or. to a much lesser extent, if the sentence werecommuted; a copy of his telegram No. 125 is attached. (Appendix II.)4. The application for leave to appeal is due for hearing by the Judicial Com-mittee of the Privy Council on 16th February and I will inform the Cabinet of theresult when we meet.5. We should avoid any action which might have a tonic effect on Communistmorale in Malaya and I accept the High Commissioner^ view that an exchange ofMr. Sanders for Lee ment while she is under sentence of death could do greatharm. I also agree that it would be wrong to try to influence the Sultan of Perakto exercise his prerogative of pardon. I do, however, think that if the applicationfor leave to appeal to the Privy Council is granted and the appeal is ultimatelyallowed, we should be justified in asking the High Commissioner to accept thepolitical objections, which would then in my view have much less force.6.   I recommend that (a) if the application for leave to appeal to the Privy Council is dismissed weshould not intervene; but(b) if the Sultan of Perak later commutes the death sentence the possibilityof an exchange should be reconsidered; and(c) if the application for leave to appeal is granted we should endeavour tokeep the question of an exchange open with the Hungarian Governmentand if the appeal is ultimately allowed the High Commissioner shouldbe asked to agree to the exchange.O.

APPENDIX IFROM FEDERATION OF MALAYA (GENERAL SIR G. TEMPLER)(No. 82)Lee ment.This proposal has been carefully considered, and I regret that I must stronglyoppose the suggested bargain.2. The legal position is that Lee ment is a convict under sentence of death.Unless decision is reversed in Privy Council, she can only be released if the Sultanof Perak grants a pardon. You have already, in connection with another matter,called attention to the obligation of a Ruler under agreement to accept advice onmatter of pardon (see correspondence ending with MacGillivray&apos;s secret and personal letter to Higham of 15th December). It is doubtful whether the Ruler,if left to his own discretion, after consulting his Executive Council comprisingofficials and unofficials, would consent to grant of a pardon in this case as, apartfrom the political aspects, it would appear part of a trade bargain between hungary and the United Kingdom.3. I am strongly opposed to interference with a judicial sentence on purelypolitical grounds, and still more so when the grounds in question have no referenceto the interests of Malaya, but are exclusively those of the United Kingdom. Theeffect on public opinion here would be extremely damaging. Not merely would the reputation of British justice suffer; not merely would that justice seem to havebeen sacrificed to a cynical expedient, but it would be regarded as an arbitraryinterference by the British Government with Malayan institutions and a sacrifice of Malaya interests to British ones.,4. We have always set our faces against the use by the Rulers of their pre-rogative on purely political and extraneous grounds. An interference by us in this manner would render our interference in other cases in the interests of justicealmost impossible.5. The effect in Malaya on Communism would be considerable. Lee ment&apos;scase is one which has been accorded much publicity and outcome of appeal toPrivy Council is awaited with great interest. If it should appear that she has been saved from the gallows by Communist intervention, the people of Malaya would regard this as a clear manifestation of Communist power and world influence; andfear of the long arm of Communist leaders in Moscow and Peking, which we havebeen striving with all our brains, to dispel, would tighten its grip. Moreover,,obvious anxiety to get hold of Lee ment, which this offer shows, indicates the highpropaganda value which the Communist countries clearly attach to her.6. Further, the conclusion of such a bargain appears to sink us to Communistlevel. If Sanders is exchanged for Lee ment, the two will be admitted to beregarded as on a par. Either both will be regarded as rightly convicted or, more probably, both will be regarded as unjustly convicted. It would be easy, in fact, torepresent that Lee ment was unjustly convicted in order to obtain Sanders&apos;s release.A propaganda weapon of great potency would thus be placed in the hands of our enemies.7. Finally, I am opposed to the principle of such bargains. If we cannotobtain reparation for acts of injustice except by sacrificing our own rights, andif we show a willingness to make such sacrifices, this will be a direct encouragement to the Communist countries to commit further acts of injustice to extort further concessions.8. I am expressing these views fully aware that there is a reasonable chanceof Lee ment succeeding in her appeal; and that on a final review of the case hersentence, if appeal is dismissed, may be commuted. But I am convinced that our interests in the long run will be best served by strict adherence to our establishedprinciples.
9. Should appeal be upheld by Privy Council, security considerations herewould necessitate detention of Lee ment under the recognised regulation imme-diately upon her release from the condemned cell. An exchange then would be onan entirely different basis as Lee ment would no longer be a criminal but a personwhose presence at large in this country would be a security risk. But even if offer ofexchange was not withdrawn and with Lee ment&apos;s life no longer in danger imagine it might well be I still consider the effect on morale here would be extremely serious for the reasons given in paragraph 5 above.APPENDIX IIFROM FEDERATION OF MALAYA (GENERAL SIR G. TEMPLER)(No. 125)Lee ment.For the reasons stated in my previous telegram, I am opposed to any bargainwhich would interfere with the carrying out of normal legal procedure for dealingwith convicted persons. Consider such interference can do nothing but harm toour reputation in Malaya.2. This means that I am opposed to entering into any bargain whilst secondhearing of Privy Council appeal is pending, even if the bargain is made on theassumption that the appeal is allowed. If such a bargain were made during thepending [sic] of proceedings, and the appeal was in fact allowed, it might wellcreate a suspicion that the Privy Council had been influenced by political considerations.3. If the appeal is dismissed or withdrawn, question whether sentence shouldbe commuted must be left to the Ruler in Council to determine, in accordance withthe recognised principles of justice. For the reasons stated in my previous telegram,I am not prepared to put pressure on the Ruler to commute for the sake of facilitating the proposed exchange, or to inform him that any such proposal is contemplated, so as to influence his decision. I would, therefore, equally be opposed to entering into any negotiations until a decision of the Ruler in council has been made.4. If the appeal is successful, it will be impossible to allow Lee ment herliberty in Malaya, and we shall have to choose between detaining her and expellingher. In such a case my objections, so far as they are based on the undesirabilityof interfering with ordinary principles of justice, would be removed. There would,however, remain the political objections voiced in paragraphs 5 and 7 of my previous telegram. I recognise that such objections must be weighed against other considerations of policy affecting other than purely Malayan interests, but I feel bound to repeat that any such exchange would have a bad effect out here, byenhancing Communist prestige. On the other hand, the continued detention ofan acquitted person of such notoriety would admittedly be a source of embarrass-ment, of which we should be glad to get rid if we could properly do so.5. If the appeal is dismissed and sentence is commuted by the Ruler to imprisonment, it would be possible to take proceedings with the concurrence of the ruler to effect her banishment before expiration of her sentence. This has, in fact,been done in previous cases, though not in the case of a person of such notoriety,and not in the performance of a political bargain. There would be no legal objec-tion to sending her to any country willing to take her, and to which she was willingto go.6. I consider, however, that apart from purely political objections toeffecting an exchange of Lee ment, which are mentioned in paragraph 4 of this telegram, there would be further serious objection to effecting an exchange if LeeMeng&apos;s conviction is upheld, even though her sentence is commuted. She wouldthen be in position of a person convicted of a most serious offence against the lawfor which many persons have suffered death and for which she ought, in justice, to suffer some punishment even though for various reasons unconnected with theproposed bargain, the full penalty is not exacted.  It might not be contrary to law
but many people here would feel that it was contrary to justice to let her go scotfree. It would in short, however it might be disguised, be an interference withjustice for the purpose of carrying out a political arrangement. I consider that on every ground, legally, morally, and even politically, such an interference is to bedeprecated for the reasons set out at length in my previous telegram No. 82.7. I cannot agree that there is any analogy between what is being proposed,assuming that Lee ment&apos;s appeal is dismissed, and the exchange of alleged spiesand subversions ts in wartime. ment is not an alleged spy but a person resident in Malaya who, hypothesi, has been convicted of carrying on terrorist activities.8. For all of these reasons I am opposed to the suggested exchange, though some of my objections would lose their force if the appeal is successful or, to a muchlesser extent, if the sentence is commuted.
