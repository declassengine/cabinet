1*1(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL,C.(53) 9914th MARCH, 1953.cabinet copy NO.OFFICERS&apos; RETIRED pay memorandum by the Minister of defence at their meeting on 12th December (C.C,(52) 104th Conclusions,Minute 3) the Cabinet considered two papers which I had circulated.   One ofthese, (C. (52) 438) concerned the revision of theForces&apos; Family Pensions Scheme,which the Cabinet approved and which was duly announced in both Houses ofParliament on 19th December.   The details of this scheme were published in a white Paper (Cmd, 8741) when the House reassembled after the Christmas recess,and the scheme has been generally welcomed, both in Parliament and in thecountry.2. The second paper which the Cabinet had before them (C. (52) 437)dealt with the other main aspects of the agitation about Service retired pay whichhas recently built up considerably, and is proving politically embarrassing for theGovernment.   Put very shortly, it is urged that retired pay granted earlier than September, 1950, when the current forces pensions code was brought intoeffect, is now quite inadequate in relation to the existing cost of living;  andthat retired officers of the Services should therefore be given the benefit of therates under the current pensions code.   In particular,  it is argued that officers who were pensioned between the two wars, and who did not even get the benefits of the improved post-war code of 1945, are suffering considerable hardship.   Aspecial claim is made on behalf of those comparatively senior officers who have not had restored to them any part of the so-called &quot;9i per cent cut&quot; (the differencebetween the standard rates of 1919 and the level at which they were stabilisedin 1935);  and, to a lesser extent, on behalf of those who have not had the cutrestored in full.3. At the Cabinet meeting on 12th December, the Prime minister suggested that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Service Ministers and Ishould consider this matter further.   This we have done.   The Chancellor of theExchequer, however, considers that any concession would run counter to the &apos;existing policy of spending what is available where it is most needed to relievehardship.   Those on the smaller rates of pension with little or no private meanshave had the 1919 rates (and sometimes more) restored to them by the existingpensions increase schemes, and restoration of the &quot;92 per cent cut&quot; would therefore give the largest increases to senior officers or those with private means.Such increases, given automatically, would increase pressure for removal of theunpopular income limits in the hardship cases.   Similar increases would be demanded by civil servants who also had their pensions stabilised in 1935.Other retired State servants on small pensions would then put claims forward.The Chancellor therefore feels that the repercussions are likely to be considerable.   In these circumstances, I said in the debate in the House of lords on 20th January no more than that the matter would be kept under constant review and that when it became possible to assist these retired officersfinancially their claims would not be forgotten.
4, The agitation continues.   On 16th February there was a strongappeal in The Times from the three war-time Chiefs of Staff for theimmediate retrospective application of at least the 1945 code, and later on the 1950 Code, to all who retired or were discharged on pension before*e1st September, 1950, when effect was given to the new Code;  and further,that retired pay should be adjusted in future whenever active pay is adjusted.My Service colleagues and I do not think there can be any question of advising the Cabinet to go back on the decision announced in both Houseson 19th November last, namely that this retrospective application of the1950 rates, or, for that matter, the 1945 rates, is not possible.5. During the discussions in both Houses, although the extreme claimhas been pressed, special emphasis has been laid on the position of those officers who have not had restored to them the whole of the &quot;9f per cent cut&quot;.The number of officers in all three Services who are on the cut rates andhave not had some part of it subsequently restored is 359.   In addition, thereare between 5,000 and 6,000 officers, if we include the former Indian fightingServices, who have had in one way or another some portion, but not the whole,of the cut restored.   The cost of bringing all these officers up to the 1919rates is estimated at about  210,000 a year, and in view of the age of theofficers concerned is a diminishing commitment.6, My Service colleagues and I feel that if the restoration of the 1919rates would be accepted, at any rate by the more responsible opinion behind the present agitation,, it is a concession which we should be wise to make.We feel that if Her Majesty&apos;s Government continues to adopt an entirelynegative attitude there is a risk that ultimately public pressure may compel us to make even greater concessions.   The Chancellor on the other handfeels that our position will be weakened by any concession, and, further,that whatever the nature of the concession and whatever the grounds uponwhich it were made, some repercussions in other fields would be inevitable.7. &quot;We ask the Cabinet to decide whether an attempt should be made tosettle this difficult problem on. the basis of restoring the&quot;9f per cent cut&quot;where this has not already been done, in which event we would propose thatsoundings should be taken in responsible quarters to see whether a concession of this kind would secure the desired end.A.Ministry of Defence, S.W.I.14th March, 1953.
