(THIS -DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret. (53) 10017th MARCH,&apos; 1953.cabinet copy NO.RELAXATION OF RESTRICTIONS ON TRADEWITH WESTERN europe memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the President of the Board of Trade.On 26th February the Cabinet considered a memorandum bythe President of the Board of Trade (C. (53) 70) in which he recommended thaturgent action should be taken to relax in some measure United Kingdomrestrictions on trade with Europe, partly by reducing restrictions on imports and partly by raising the tourist allowance, in order to counter the increasing pressure in the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.)and the danger of a general reversal of current liberal trade policies in Europe(C.C.(53) 15th Conclusions, Minute 6),    The Cabinet(i) Agreed that at the meeting of the O.E.E.C. Steering board for Trade on 4th March, United Kingdom representatives should state that Her Majesty&apos;s Government were urgentlyexamining United Kingdom import arrangements and that ministers would inform the Council of the results at its meeting on 23rd March.(ii) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Presidentof the Board of Trade to submit to the Cabinet their detailed proposals regarding the tourist allowance and relaxation of import restrictions.2,   - A copy of the memorandum which the United kingdom representatives submitted on  5th March to the 0,E.E.C. Steering Board for trade and which puts clearly on record the facts about our payments situationis attached (Annex I).   The intimation that the United Kingdom, despite therisk to its payments position, had already put in hand urgently an examinationof ways and means of easing the difficulties of our European partners, andespecially of France and Italy, was received with satisfaction,3. The statement about our import arrangements which ministers have undertaken to make at the meeting of the Council of the O.E,E.C, on23rd March will be awaited with great anxiety.   A worthwhile contribution .from the United Kingdom at this stage would do much to restore confidenceamong our European partners.   While, for the time being, precipitate action by France and Italy appears to have been prevented, there is no doubt thatthese countries have been subject to strong internal pressures to reduce their imports and have been able to resist them only with difficulty.   Their tradingpolicies, and those of other Western European countries, will be greatly influenced by the action we are able to take.   Against this background itseems to us essential that the United Kingdom, even at some risk, should be
JSCable to present to the O.E.E.C. Council on Z3rd March a balanced plan ofworthwhile relaxations, which will make a real impact and will show that we are ready to go as far as we can to help preserve liberal trade policies in Europe.This is the crucial moment.   If we are unable to do this now the consequences for the whole policy of liberal trading in Western Europe will be serious and far-reaching.   Italy, which at present has practically no quota restrictions,may at the least be expected to withdraw a substantial part of her liberalisationmeasures and may well try to revert to bilateralism;   France is likely to intensify substantially her present restrictions on imports from other european countries.   In these circumstances the other major countries would find themselves forced by political pressures to re-impose restrictions on their imports.   There would thus be set in train a downward spiral of trade to theserious detriment of our exports and of our trading and political position inEurope generally.   With this in mind we recommend to our colleagues theproposals for relaxations in import restrictions and for raising the touristallowance set out in paragraphs 4 and 5 of this memorandum.   We consider thatthis programme is the minimum necessary to achieve the purpose we have inmind and that it should be announced and put into effect on 23rd March.4,    Import RestrictionsOfficials have prepared a detailed plan, of which an outlineis given in Annex II, for relaxing import restrictions within an estimated costof  30 millions in a full year (which would represent about 3, 5 per cent oftotal United Kingdom imports from Western Europe in 1952),   The plan is designed to provide, within this total, a reasonably balanced list of relaxationswhich could be defended both at home and abroad.   The additional expenditure would be concentrated almost entirely on foodstuffs and manufactured goods,the latter receiving somewhat the larger share.   Rather more than two-thirds of the expenditure would be applied to freeing from quantitative restriction alimited range of items;  this would have the effect of raising from 44 to 58the percentage of our imports on private account from Europe which is free from quantitative restriction, as compared  with the minimum standard of 75 per ceset by the O.E.E.C.  The remaining expenditure would be applied to increasingquotas for the large range of goods on which for the time being restrictionsmust be maintained.   The proposed relaxations cover a fair spread of items onwhich foreign complaint about United Kingdom restrictions has been most intense.Particular attention has been paid to items which are of special interest toFrance and Italy.   The Open General Licences would come into effect immediately on announcement;  the quota increases would be for the second half of the year but licences would be issued in the course of April and Mayand would be valid from the date of issue,5,    Tourist AllowanceAt present the tourist allowance is  25; this compares with aminimum standard of  35 laid down by the O.E.E,C. It is estimated that an allowance of  35 would cost in a full year  5-6 millions and that increases to  40 and  50 would cost about  8 millions and  10 millions respectively.These estimates are subject to a considerable margin of error, but experience shows that the cost falls proportionately as the allowance is increased..  Moreover,the higher the rate the less the incentive to evasion.If we could go as high as  50, the benefit and gesture to Franceand Italy and other O.E.E.C, countries would be more generous and impressive.On the other hand, there are the following main arguments for not going as high as  50:
(i) the level of the tourist allowance is regarded by many as abarometer of the country&apos;s economic position.   An increase to  50 goes beyond what the public:expect at the moment andwould be taken as a sign that our economic position iscomfortable and might provoke pressure for furtherrelaxations;(ii) we could not exclude the possibility that we might be forcedat some future date to consider reducing the allowance again;(iii) the French Government have stated that an increase in the allowance to  40 would be sufficient to restore the UnitedKingdom tourist traffic to France almost to its traditionallevel.We accordingly consider that the allowance should be increased to  40,7.   Conclusions      We invite our colleagues:(i) to approve relaxations in imports on the scale proposedin paragraph 4;(ii) to agree to the tourist allowance being raised to  40;(iii) to authorise the announcement of the relaxations at themeeting of the O.E.E.C. Council on23rd March and theirsimultaneous announcement in London.R.A.B.P.T.17th March, 1953.ANNEX memorandum SUBMITTED BY UNITED kingdom representatives TO THE O.E.E.C. STEERING board for TRADE ON 5th MARCH, 1953.The United Kingdom Government have considered carefullyand sympathetically the matters raised in Baron Snoy&apos;s letter of 16th February,1953, to Sir Hugh Ellis-Rees concerning the restrictions which they have been obliged, for balance of payments reasons, to impose upon imports from the other member countries of the 0,E.E.C.2. In determining their attitude towards these issues, the UnitedKingdom Government are bound, however, to have regard to their positionas a debtor in the fifth tranche in the European Payments Union and to thecurrent and future trend of the United Kingdom&apos;s balance of payments with theUnion.   As regards the first point, the United Kingdom&apos;s debt to the Union stijlamounted at the end of January to 582 million units of account, while of the goldpaid by the United Kingdom to the Union 298 million units of account were still
outstanding.   As regards the second point, reference has already been made inparagraph 5 of the earlier United Kingdom memorandum to the crucial part played by the commodity arbitrage scheme in transforming the United Kingdomposition in the Union from that of a current debtor to that of a current creditorand the United Kingdom Government are glad to note that this is recognised in the first paragraph of the letter under reply.   It cannot be too stronglyemphasised, however, that the large surpluses in the last four months of1952, being swollen by receipts of a non-recurrent character, do not give a truepicture of the underlying trend of the United Kingdom&apos;s balance of payments with the Union.   United Kingdom receipts through the Union in those four monthson account of the arbitrage transaction amounted to 165 million units: theUnited Kingdomls &quot;real&quot; surplus in this period was thus only 152 million units,i. e. less than 40 million units a month.   The rate of the United Kingdom,ssurplus has now fallen off sharply:  in January it was only 25. 9 million units of account and the provisional figure for February is 27. 6 million units.   Thefirst quarter of the year is normally the most favourable period for the sterling area balance with the other Member countries of the O.E.E.C. and on  Presenttrends it is expected that the monthly surplus will decline still further.   It isestimated that United Kingdom surpluses for the first six months of 1953 will be substantially less than the &quot;real&quot; surplus in the fourth quarter of 1952, and thatsurpluses are unlikely to continue in the second half of 1953,3. It is clearly desirable, from the point of view of the Union no less than that of the United Kingdom, that the United Kingdom should be insurplus at a rate which would give it the prospect of paying off its debt to theUnion within a reasonable period of time.   This principle has been recognised by the Organisation in the case of other debtor countries.   Even with an average monthly surplus of 30 million units it would take more than two years to bringthe United Kingdom back into balance.   Moreover, a monthly surplus at thatrate would be less than 3 per cent of the average monthly total of sterlingtransactions cleared through the Union and would represent therefore, in thecase of the United Kingdom, a very narrow margin.   In fact, as indicated above,prospects, on present trends and estimates, are much less favourable,4. In these circumstances, there is clearly a very real risk that a further relaxation of import or other restrictions would bring theUnited Kingdom once again into current deficit with the Union.   Certainly therewould be little or no scope for the progressive improvement of the UnitedKingdom&apos;s cumulative position in the Union which the Steering Board recognisethat the United Kingdom is justified in pursuing.5. The United Kingdom Government are, however, fully alive tothe adverse effect of their restrictions on the external trade and the currentposition in the European Payments Union of other Member countries, andparticularly of France and Italy.   They recognise also that, if current trendscontinue, there is a risk that certain Member countries may decide to withdrawsome part of their present measures of liberalisation or to intensify theirimport restrictions.   They would much regret such a development both in itself and because of its adverse effect on the liberalisation programme as a whole.They therefore wish to state once again that it remains the policy of the UnitedKingdom Government to take whatever steps are open to them, subject to thegeneral balance of payments position of the United Kingdom and to the presentposition and future prospects of the United Kingdom in the European payments union, to maintain the liberalisation of intra-European trade at the highestpracticable level.6. Accordingly, the United Kingdom Government had already putin hand a study of what steps it might be possible for them to take in theimmediate future to alleviate the difficulties of their European partners in the
directions indicated at the end of Baron Snoy&apos;s letter.   This study, in the courseof which full account will be taken of the considerations to which the SteeringBoard has drawn attention, is being pursued with all possible speed but because of the great importance and complexity of the issues involved it hasnot yet been possible for them to come to a final decision.   They will, however,be prepared to inform the Ministerial Council on 23rd March of the measuresthey feel able to take both generally in the field of visibles and invisiblesand with particular reference to assisting France and Italy.ANNEX IIOUTLINE OF PLAN FOR RELAXATION OF import restrictions.The total additional cost of the proposed relaxations in imports is estimated at about  30 millions in a full year;   Of this amount rather morethan two-thirds would be for items to be &quot;liberalised&quot; (i. e. to be freedentirely from quantitative restrictions) and the rest for increases in quotas forthe much larger number of items, imports of which must for the time being remain subject to restrictions for balance of payments reasons.2. At the present time 44 per cent of our imports on private accountfrom Europe is free from quantitative restriction as compared with the minimum standard of 75 per cent (60 per cent in each of the three categories, foodstuffs,manufactured goods and raw materials) set by the Organisation for european economic Co-operation.   The effect of the relaxations would be to raise theUnited Kingdom overall percentage to 58,   For foodstuffs the percentage would rise from 50 to 58;  for manufactures from 21 to 64 and for raw materials from53 to 56.3, Of the total additional expenditure of about  30 millions, 13 to  14 millions would be accounted for by imports of foodstuffs,  15 to 16 millions by imports of manufactured goods and nearly  1 million by imports of raw materials.   The reason for the small figure for raw materials isthat the bulk of United Kingdom imports of raw materials on private accountwere not affected by the import licensing restrictions imposed in November 1951and March 1952.4. In foodstuffs, the main item recommended for liberalisationis unrationed cheese.   Other foodstuffs recommended for liberalisation includelentils and butter beans, canned tomato juice and puree, certain non-indigenousfruits, olive oil and glace cherries.   In the quota sector the effect of theproposals would be to raise quotas for most goods to 50 per cent or more of thelevel of imports in 1951 from the countries concerned except for those items forwhich imports in 1951 were artificially high or for which demand has sincedeclined substantially.5. In manufactured goods, the most important items proposed forliberalisation are all textile yarns and wool piece goods.   A wide selection of other manufactured goods, involving a relatively small additional expenditure,has also been recommended for liberalisation.   These include carpets, footwear,gloves, plate and sheet glass, food, and drink machinery and a number of semi-manufactured and manufactured goods required by United Kingdom industrysuch as hat hoods, key and button blanks, roofing tiles etc.   In the quotasector the proposals would have the effect of raising the general level of quotas for manufactured goods to between 40 per cent and 50 per cent of the level ofimports in 1951,
ho /MID6. The raw materials recommended for liberalisation includecork, marble, slate blocks and certain gums and waxes,7. The items selected for relaxation include many of traditionalimportance to the trade of our partners in Western Europe.   particular attention has been paid to items of special interest to France and Italy.8, The increases in quotas would be for the second half ofthis year;  licences for that period, however, will be issued in the course ofApril and May and be valid as from the date of issue.   The measures of liberalisation would come into effect immediately on announcement.9. Full details of the proposed plan of relaxations are set outin a report of the Import Licensing Committee.
