E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,17th February, 1953.
ANNEX IThe Department of State has informed the Embassy that the delay which hasbeen encountered in deciding on a course of future action in connexion with the iranian oil negotiations has been the result of reluctance to go forward on a courseof action which seemed to have remote possibilities for success. On the otherhand, the Department has not been able to devise any further formula to which both the British and Musaddiq would be likely to agree. The Department hasalso been concerned about a new factor in the situation which, in the last few weeks,has become more evident and which was vividly brought out by the threat whichMUsaddiq made in his conversation of 3rd February with Ambassador Hendersonto sell oil to all comers at a discount of 50 per cent. The Department has felt,&apos;for a long time that the deterrent to Iran&apos;s dumping its oil is not primarily the threat of legal action by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (A.I.O.C.), but rather certainfactors which arise from the commercial situation, perhaps the most important ofwhich is the availability of tankers. It is becoming rapidly clear that the futuretanker position, including charter rates, will, in the very near future, be such that dr. Musaddiq may be in a position to give effect to his threat. The Departmentregards this as an inescapable fact.The daily charter position has weakened considerably. Single voyage rates are now quoted as low as 40 per cent, below the United States Maritime Corn-mission^ rates for foreign flag vessels. This rate compares with premiums of100-200 per cent, a year or 18 months ago. The rates for charters over one year or two years are approximately 15 per cent, below U.S.M.C. This compares witha premium of 50 per cent, which was fixed a few months ago. Tanker constructionis going ahead at a rate which gives little indication that the future supply position will be anything other&apos;than easy.The Department recalls that Her Majesty&apos;s Government is, of course, aware that it considers a number of solutions vastly preferable to no solution at all. Suchalternative solutions would include a provision for compensation through a long-term contract with A.I.O.C. at an excessive discount or a reasonable lump sumsettlement. The Department feels that either one of these solutions holds less dangerfrom the point- of view of their effect on other concessionary areas than does the lack of any solution at all. Her Majesty&apos;s Government has frequently indicated itsconcern at the effect which an Iranian oil settlement might have on other conces-commisionary areas, but the Department feels that a hard look should also be taken atthe possible effect which no solution at all might have. For its part, the Departmentcannot fail to be concerned at what it considers may be the effects of no solution on other concessionary areas in which both the British and American governments have an interest.Moreover, the Department believes that because of the commercial factors which have been outlined above, the British bargaining position will in the futurebecome worse with: respect to Iran than it is at the present time. The Departmenttherefore feels that this factor should also be carefully analysed before concedingthe failure of the present negotiations.There are attached revised drafts of-a compensation agreement and a D.M.P.A.agreement, on which the Department comments as follows:  It recognises that He^Majesty^ Government has come a long way in its efforts to reach a settlement and it feels that the proposals on which the United States andthe United Kingdom could agree for the next approach to Musaddiq, presumablyon the lines of the attached texts, are not unreasonable. However, in view of thepolitical situation in Iran, the Department also does not consider unreasonableDr. Musaddiq&apos;s concern about the acceptance of a solution which politically couldbe called &quot; bondage forever.&quot; In fact, there is a practical limitation on the ability of Iran to pay and on the value of the property when its earning power is takeninto account. The Department believes, therefore, that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould at least try to meet Musaddiq&apos;s concern in a manner somewhat along thelines of the alternative wording of paragraph 3 of the attached CompensationAgreement. Similarly, the Department feels that an attempt should be made tomeet Dr. Musaddiq on the question of interest.
From the Departments point of view, there are two alternative approacheswhich are possible:1. Ambassador Henderson could go back to Dr. Musaddiq with the attachedtexts, substituting the alternative wording in paragraph 3 of the CompensationAgreement. With this in hand, the Department feels that there would be at least some, although admittedly a small, possibility of success.2. The United States could withdraw from the negotiations without referenceto any further documents. Ambassador Henderson could tell Musaddiq that since the proposals which were given him on 15th January were unacceptable, and since the proposals which he had made on 17th January, as later supplemented,were not acceptable to the British, and since the United States has not been ableto find a way to bridge these differences, the United States Government had cometo the reluctant opinion that there is nothing further which Ambassador Hendersoncan do at this time to promote a settlement of the dispute.The Departments clear preference is for the first alternative. If negotiations should then fail, the breakdown would come over Dr.Musaddiq&apos;s refusal to agree to a specific offer to meet his point on &quot; economic bondage.&quot; If the negotiations failedin this manner, there would be a real public relations advantage and it wouldbe preferable to the present situation in which there is-some confusion as to wherethe two parties really stand. The Department also feels that if the negotiationsbreak down without a return offer of this kind, Musaddiq could effectively maintain that the British had refused to accept any type of settlement which did not imply that Iran might be required to pay indefinitely and in amounts beyond hercapacity.The Department feels that whatever course of action is decided upon, it shouldbe taken quickly since all evidence points to the probability that Musaddiq willnot refrain very much longer from disclosing the negotiations with explanations tothe press and to the Majlis.The Department has requested the Embassy to ascertain Her Majesty&apos;governments views on the foregoing points.Compensation Agreement11th February, 1953.The Government of Iran and the Government of the United Kingdom:Desiring to bring about a settlement of all claims and counter-claims which have arisen in the case of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Ltd., a United Kingdomregistered company which formerly operated in Iran, hereinafter referred to asthe company:Have agreed to refer the said claims and counter-claims to the international court of Justice in accordance with the provisions of Parts I and III of the present-agreement ; and have agreed further that the arrangements for the payment of anybalance due in consequence of the decision of the Court shall be those set out inPart II of the present agreement.Have agreed further that the arrangements for the payment of any balancedue in consequence of the decision of the Court shall be those set out in Part ii of the present agreement.Part I1.

ANNEX IIDr. Musaddiq asked to see Ambassador Henderson at noon on 14th February.Musaddiq began by saying that it had become clear that the British did not want to arrive at a settlement of the oil problem; that it was no longer possible for himto handle his critics who were demanding immediate action in the light of the steady deterioration of Iranian economic and financial situation; and that he had therefore made the decision to forward a message to the Majlis on 17th Februarystating that there was no longer a hope of achieving a settlement of the oil problem and asking for its approval for Iran to begin immediately to sell oil to all comersat any price which could be paid. The Prime Minister added that he was conscious of American concern regarding the sale of oil to countries behind the Iron Curtain.Nevertheless, in the light of public opinion in Iran, he had no other choice in theevent of a break down in the talks than sales to any nation which is willing topurchase unless American nationals or the American Government were ready to buy Iran&apos;s oil in substantial amounts.Ambassador Henderson told Dr. Musaddiq that he felt that it would be pre-mature to take such action. He still hoped to receive instructions during the comingweek which would enable him to renew the effort to breach the gap between theBritish and Iranian positions. Musaddiq said that he was appreciative of the attempts which had been made to solve this problem, but he was now convincedthat nothing would come from them. Ambassador Henderson admitted that thePrime Minister might be correct, but was insistent that as long as even a shadowof possibility of reaching a settlement remained, the Prime Minister should not take precipitate action. Musaddiq finally agreed to postpone until 21st february the action which he contemplates. If the United Kingdom and Iran have not reached agreement by that date, he would be compelled to forward his message tothe Majlis.Musaddiq enquired what would happen if the talks should end in failure duringthe coming week. Ambassador Henderson replied by saying that it seemed tohim that Dr. Musaddiq himself was in the best position to answer that question.While he did not wish to try to persuade the Prime Minister that he should notsell oil to any buyer at cut prices, he nevertheless felt it his duty as Iran&apos;s friend toinform the Prime Minister that sales of this kind would not solve the Iranianfinancial problem. Even at cut prices, few responsible companies would be willingto come promptly forward and buy Iranian oil in the absence of a settlement ofthe compensation question. Any sales which Iran might make to adventurousbusiness concerns in the free world or to iron curtain countries would be sonegligible as not to provide any real solution for the difficult economic and budgetaryproblems which his Government is facing. The only effective and proper answer to this problem would be a settlement of the question of compensation, followed by arrangements for the sale of substantial quantities of oil to buyers who possess the necessary distribution and transportation facilities. A.I.O.C. is at present theonly potential buyer which is able to distribute substantial quantities of Iranian oil.Iran, if it sincerely hopes to solve its economic and financial problems through itsoil industry, should be ready, not only to reach a settlement on compensation, butto sell large quantities of its oil to A.I.O.C or to some international organisation inwhich a major role would be played by A.I.O.C. Musaddiq replied that he isprepared to sell Iranian oil to an international company in which A.I.O.C. would bea participant provided that an agreement could be reached on the terms of sale.However, he foresaw little chance that the compensation question could be solved.Ambassador Henderson replied that it appeared to him that the present issue withrespect to compensation is that Iran does not desire to agree to terms of reference for adjudication by the International Court of Justice (I.C.J.) which might result inIran being required to pay more compensation than it felt itself able to pay; theBritish felt, on the other hand, that in view of public opinion in the United King-dom and of the opinion of the entire business world, they could not agree to termsof reference which would limit compensation to the loss of A.I.O.C.&apos;s physicalproperty in Iran.Dr. Musaddiq expressed agreement but was insistent that he had put forward a proposal for avoiding this issue by concluding an agreement with the Britishwhereby Iran would pay 25 per cent, of the proceeds of the sales of oil over an agreed period of years. However, he said that he understood that the British didnot desire to listen to proposals for settling the oil question through means other
than adjudication or arbitration. He added that after the various talks which hadtaken place thus far, the British could not but realise that no agreement could bereached regarding terms of reference for submitting this question to the I.C.J.Therefore, British refusal to consider other methods for reaching a settlementconstituted convincing evidence to him that the British did not desire a settlement.While pretending that they want a settlement, the British were utilising theirnumerous contacts in Iran in an effort to overthrow him through alliance of forces which include the Bakhtiari and other tribal elements, discarded politicians,fanatical religious groups lead by irresponsible Mullahs, Communist front organi-sations and disgruntled reactionary groups in the bureaucracy and army. TheBritish apparently entertained the hope that a subservient Government would emerge from the chaos which would follow his overthrow. It is possible that theBritish might succeed in overthrowing his Government. If they did, however, theywould also eliminate Iran from the free world. He had no intention of remainingidle while his country is being destroyed. He would take counter measures. Hewas issuing an order to suppress sternly uprisings among the Bakhtiari tribes. he expressed the hope that the implementation of this order would not create an impression of friction between the Shah and him. Merely because the Shah&apos;s wifewas of Bakhtiari origin, he could not fail to ensure security in that area.Ambassador Henderson told Musaddiq that he was persuaded that the UnitedKingdom was just as anxious to reach a settlement of the oil proposal as Musaddiqand that the United Kingdom would like to reach an agreement which was soadvantageous both to the United Kingdom and Iran as to make it durable. It,therefore, seemed to Ambassador Henderson that we should be concentrating onthe question of an oil settlement. The Prime Minister should not be too pessimisticabout such a possibility. A few weeks ago there was a widespread impression thatit would be impossible to reach a settlement of the Sudan question. Nevertheless,as a result of a high order of statesmanship in the United Kingdom and Egypt, anagreement over the Sudan has just been reached. Dr. Musaddiq indicated hissurprise. He said that he had not been informed about this agreement and requested details. Ambassador Henderson, replied that although his information was scant, he would outline what information he had from foreign press reports.Musaddiq said he was quite certain that Egypt would lose by this agreement.Henderson indicated that although his information was limited, he was confident that the agreement was beneficial to both parties.Dr. Musaddiq said, after further discussion, that he would stand by the state-ment which he had made earlier in the conversation. If his counter-proposals hadnot been accepted by 21st February or if new proposals which appeared to containpromise for a solution had not been conveyed to him by then, he would send to the!Majlis a message along the lines which he had outlined to Ambassador Henderson.
