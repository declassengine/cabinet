(53) 6877//7 February, 1953^    v .;;J1 :n ;     62CABINETTHE CORONATION service memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations the attached draft telegram, which I have agreed with the Lord Chancellor,sets out the Commonwealth problems involved in the proposal that the speaker of the House of Commons should take a special part in the Coronation Ceremony.SWINTON.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,17th February, 1953.DRAFT TELEGRAM TO UNITED KINGDOM HIGH commissioners in COMMONWEALTH countries. A suggestion has been made by some Members on the coronation committee that the Speaker of the House of Commons should take some part inthe Coronation Ceremony as representing the United Kingdom House of Commons;and as &quot; Chief Commoner.&quot;2. The suggestion is that when the Peers do Homage, the Speaker of theUnited Kingdom House of Commons should also do Homage, using either thesame language as the Peers or a suitable adaptation.3. The argument is that as representative Peers do their Homage there shouldbe some way in which the House of Commons and the people of this country should express their loyalty to the Queen at the same time. It was further suggested thatthe appropriate way in which this could be done would be by the Speaker of theHouse of Commons as representing the whole House and the people of the UnitedKingdom. . &apos;; V:..&apos;&apos;&apos;- ; tetftiqcxq tx-\q -yJn tsjuMt4. It was, of course, appreciated that the Speaker if he so acted, would represent, only the Commons estate of the United Kingdom alone and would&apos;inno sense represent the other Parliaments or countries of the Commonwealth. I- 5. At the same time this is a matter that I should immediately bring&apos;to thenotice of the Prime Minister of &apos; . &apos; t apologise for doing this at such short notice, but the proposal has only now been made for the first time. : -43756
6.   As I see it there are two aspects Common wealth Governments may wishto consider.a. ........&quot;&quot;&apos;:&apos;&quot;;If the Speaker of the United Kingdom House of Commons takes part, wouldthey feel that the Speaker or some representative of their Parliaments should have:a similar opportunity during the Ceremony.   The point at which the United&apos;Kingdom Speaker would take part in the Ceremony would be the act of Homage.For Peers this is in the following form:  &quot; I............Duke, or Earl, &amp;c, of ......... do become your liege man of life and limb, and of earthly worship; and faith and truth I will bear unto you,to live and die, against all manner of folks.   So help me God.&quot;7.   Records of the 1937 Coronation show that (a) participation in the Homage,(b) participation in the Recognition by Commonwealth countries were considered.It was decided that (a) was not appropriate, and this was not suggested to commonwealth Governments. &apos;.(b\ Participation in Recognition was suggested informally to Dominion high commissioners; but this suggestion was not followed up as High Commissionerfor South Africa doubted advisability and High Commissioner for Australiapreferred retention of the traditional ceremony.8. The following proposals were put to the Commonwealth countries and accepted:(1) carrying of standards in accordance with the 1911 precedent;(2) inclusion of Dominion Prime Ministers in the Processions in the Abbeywith precedence immediately after the Prime Minister of the UnitedKingdom.Having regard to the views then expressed even by some of the old Dominionsand the action taken, it is unlikely there would be any possibility of Common-wealth Governments to-day collectively agreeing to take part in either Homage orRecognition.9. All Commonwealth countries have agreed in participation on the 1937precedent. I think there was general agreement that whatever the individual viewsof particular Commonwealth. Governments might be, it was desirable in all matterstouching the Coronation, as with the Royal Style and Title, that there should bethe maximum of visible unanimity. Thus the Commonwealth Prime Ministers willall take part in the Procession.&apos; 10. It is true that the Indian High Commissioner will not, like other high commissioners, be carrying a standard in the Abbey. This exception would be generally understood in view of India&apos;s special position. If the United KingdomSpeaker alone did homage this, too, might not excite adverse comment, thoughnon-participation of Speakers from overseas countries of the Commonwealth would no doubt be noticed. But if the United Kingdom Speaker and perhaps only twoor three of the other Commonwealth Speakers did homage, lack of unity in thispart of ceremony would be brought into conspicuous and undesirable prominence.B. &apos;.&apos; .;./!.&apos;&quot;&apos;11. The other aspect is, assuming that the Commonwealth Governments didnot wish their Speaker or other representative to play a similar part, would they take any exception to the Speaker of the United Kingdom House of Commonstaking the part proposed for him as representing the House Of Commons and people,in what would be the Homage of the three estates of the Realm of the UnitedKingdom in the Ceremony?12.   A Special Committee has been appointed to consider, this matter further and report to the Coronation Committee.  I should be grateful if you will immediately consult your Prime Minister and let me have his views on thissuggestion.,
