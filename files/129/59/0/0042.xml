MOTE 3Y THE CHIEFS OF STAFFWe have examined the attached report prepared by theChief of the Imperial G-eneral Staff on the completion ofhis recent visit to Kenya.     We endorse the recommendations in paragraph 11 thereof.2.      The War Office are examining the provision of theArmy reinforcements recommended in paragraph 11 (e) of thereport.3*     As a result of discussion between local colonialauthorities and Air Force Commanders,  preparations are inhand for the despatch to Kenya from Rhodesia of threeHarvard aircraft.     These aircraft, together with transport aircraft which it is hoped could be provided on a temporary basis as required,  should meet the requirements for R. A. F.reinforcements recommended in paragraph 11 (e) of therepo rt.h.     We must point out,  however, that so far no officialrequest for the use of these aircraft has yet been receivedfrom the Kenya Government.      This prompts us to record thatwe have gained the impression that there is a reluctanceon the part of those engaged in the operations in Kenyato apply for all the facilities they require to bring thepresent emergency to a speedy conclusion owing to a faultyunderstanding of the financial position.      We feel strongly that any misunderstanding of this nature should be cleared up as a matter of the greatest urgency,  and that it should,be impressed upon the authorities concerned that it is their duty to represent their full needs without feeling restricted by any question of cost.Recommendation5.      We invite the Cabinet Defence Committee to endorse our conclusions and to authorise the early implementation of therecommendations (Paragraph 11 of the attached report) ofthe Chief of the Imperial General Staff.(Signed) R.

ANNEXgEP^^By^^gai^lqe-THE. imperial smsral staffON :hls -fTsiT^^KMJA-     ^     *-l A-19 - 2k&apos; February1.      During ray visit to Kenya I had discussions with theGovernor on arrival and before departure.      Also on arrivalI discussed the situation with General Hinde, the Chief ofPolices Chief Commissioner for African Affairs and the intelligence Adviser.      I covered the whole of the troubledarea by road or air,  including a trip by jeep to the top ofthe Aberdarc- Mountains.2.      During my tour I discussed their problems on the spot,with all the Battalion Commanders engaged, and with a numberof company and platoon Commanders;    with the two ProvincialCommissioners concerned and their corresponding police officers;and with a number of District Officers and their correspondingpolice officers.      I had a lengthy discussion with Mr.  Blundellthe leader of the European community, and met a representativeselection of European farmers and residents.      I also met someof the Xikuyu -chiefs in the reserve.      General Cameron, theG. 0. C.  East Africa, accompanied me throughout my tour.Although short in t ime I believe my tour was sufficientlycomprehensive to enable me to form definite conclusions.3.      The present situation in Kenya has been&apos; described in atelegram and despatch from the Governor to the colonial secretary which he was good enough to discuss with me on the evening of my departure.      Briefly the position is that although some progress has been made against the marauding gangs, in themore effective policing of the disturbed areas, and in curbingthe European hotheads, the problem of restoring law and order is beset with difficulties, and there is a definite danger that the trouble may increase and spread before it can be cured.In my view the major steps required to deal with the emergencyare : -(a) The early preparation of an overall plan of campaign,and the putting over of the plan so that  it isunderstood, accepted, and worked to by all concerned.This  is in hand.      The closest co-operation betweenthe Civil administration, the security forces, andthe general public;    and the most Careful co-ordinationof effort and resources within the framework of the overall plan will be essential.      To produce these will be one of General Iiinde&apos;s main functions.(b) A full realisation by all concerned of the vitalimportance of speed in curing the disease before itg-jts wojse and spreads.      Another reason for speed isthe heavy drain on the resources of the country imposed by the mobilization of a high proportion of theEuropean man power.      The need for speed is undoubtedlyappreciated, but my impression was that there is notyet a full sense of operational urgency in all quarters.(c) The earliest possible gaining of the initiative in both the operational and civil administration field,and. the vigorous prosecution of a sustained offensive in all fields.      This calls for more resources,particularly well trained police with good qualityEuropean leadership.
(d)      Inspired and personal leadership at all levels.This demands some relief for the Governor;. Provincialand District Commissioners, and senior police officials from the burden of routine duties.Those measures apply to the- problems of ending the present emergency.      I have not considered the serious longer termpolitical and economic problems which are outside my province.k.      Although quite a bit can be done to increase the effectiveness of the existing security forces in Kenya byimprovement in training, equipment, organisation, and by raising the strength of KAR battalions;    and although plans for theexpansion of the Kenya Regiment and police forces are in hand,I have reluctantly been forced to the conclusion that such measures cannot produce what is required in time or sufficientquantity to give a reasonable chance of bringing the emergencyto an early end.      More forces are required immediately to giveconfidence in the ability and determination of the Governmentto bring the emergent to an early and successful conclusion,and to fill the gaps while the police forces are being developed and expanded.5.      Before leaving Nairobi I gave General Cameron instructionswhat should be done locally in the field of training andequipment in addition to tho measures he had already put in hand.I also made certain suggestions to the Governor,      Commander-in-Chief M. 3. L. P.  and the War Office will take the other stepsrequired under those headings as fast and as far as resourcespermit.6.      On the organisational side I am convinced that nothingless than direction and control at the top by the smallemergency committee recommended by the Governor,, with GeneralHinde as its executive s and an efficient Secretariat, can work with the speed and decision needed.7.      As regards the Army command organisation, one Brigadierwith an attenuated staff and no signals cannot exercise effectivecommand over five equivalent battalions deployed on a company or Platoon basis over an area about 130 miles long and 120 mileswide.      What is required is two brigade headquarters with adequate signals, one at each of tho Provincial CommissionersHeadquarters.      East Africa Command Headquarters could thenexercise the functions normally carried out by a DivisionalHeadquarters in conjunction with General Hinde.      There istherefore a clear need for an appropriately organised and equipped signal unit for the existing Brigade plus anotherBrigade Headquarters complete with a similar signal unit.-8.      I have given very careful thought to the question of thestrength of the Army reinforcements required.      Bearing in mind the possibility that the disorders in Kenya may spread before they can be cured, the risk that fresh outbreaks may occur inthe central African Colonies, and tho fact that the volunteerand locally conscripted European man-power cannot be retained by tho Army or Police for more than a limited time without serious repercussions, I have come to the conclusion that theminimum Requirement is two additional Infantry Battalions.At the same time steps should be taken to bring all battalions of the K. A.R.  to a strength of four rifle companies each of four effective platoons, plus an adequate signal platoon and intelligence section, both of which are essential for present day internal security operations.      This will call for pressure-k-
by the Colonial Office on the Governments of Colonies otherthan Kenya.9.      It is most important from every point of view that theprovision of Armjr reinforcements should not lead to any relaxation of plans and efforts to build up the Polic e, forces and intelligence organisation to a strength and efficiencysufficient to carry out the effective policing of the whole country.10.    There is a need for increased Air reconnaissance.      As the campaign against the marauding gangs progresses they may welloffer suitable targets for air strikes,, and there will probablybe an increased need for air supply.      These requirements shouldbe met as quickly as possible by the provision of a suitableR. A. F.  unit.11.    Recommend at ions.To sum up my recommendations are :-(a) The small emergency council recommended by the governor should be set up without delay. It is essential to the effective prosecution of the emergency campaign.(b) Means should be found to enable the Governor and hisProvincial and District Commissioners to provide the personal inspiration,;leadership and contacts which are essential to success.(c) The steps required to complete the expansion of theregular police forces and intelligence organisation to a strength and standard sufficient for the effectivepolicing of the whole country should be pressed on withas a matter of great urgency.      The ultimate strengthof the police force and intelligence organisation shouldbe based on a carefuj. appreciation of the likely effectof the longer term problems on security.(d) Colonial Governments not already doing so should berequired to bring their battalions of the K. A. R. up to a strength of four rifle companies.each of four platoonsplus a signal platoon and intelligence section.(e) Meantime the following reinforcements should be sent to kenya as quickly as possible :-**Army.      One Infantry Brigade signal troop.(British)   One Infantry Brigade H. Q.  and signal troop.Two Infantry Battalions.R. A. F.    One small unit of aircraft capable ofreconnaissance, strikes against smalltargets of personnel, and air supply.These reinforcements should be primarily for use in kenya, but should be at the disposal of Cs-in-G M. E.  foruse elsewhere in the event  of a higher priority task.They should be used to the full from their arrival in kenya to make their maximum contribution to the ending of the emergency and so to their release.12.      I gave a copy of this report to General Robertson on myway through Fayid for information and action as appropriate byB. D. C. C. (ME), and I am sending a copy to H. E. The Governor of kenya.(Signed) JOHN HARDING27th February, 1953.C. I. G. S.
