(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE-PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYlS GOVERNMENT&apos;secret,(53) 96 , COPY NO. $211TH MARCH, 1953CABINETSANDERS - LEE ment EXCHANGEMemorandum by the Minister of state the Sultan of Perak in Council has now decided to reprieve Lee Mengand an early decision is required as to whether we should agree in principle tothe proposed exchange.    It is, therefore, appropriate to consider the arguments in favour of, and against, doing so.2.        When the question of the exchange was first mooted, the HighCommissioner for the Federation of Malaya and the Commissioner-general for the United Kingdom in South-East Asia raised serious political objections.These were:-(i)    Lee ment&apos;s release would be exploited by communist propaganda as a manifestation of Communist power and world influence;(ii)    it would be represented that the two cases were on apar and that both persons had been unjustly convicted;(iii) interference with a judicial sentence on political grounds in which Malaya is not interested would be resented by public opinion in Malaya;(iv) the reputation of British justice would suffer andthe previous refusal of Her Majesty&apos;s Government toagree to a similar proposal by the Indonesian Govern-ment might prove embarrassing.3.        On the other hand there are the following important considerations infavour of trying to carry out the exchange without delay:-(i)    Sanders, who has already served three years of athirteen years&apos; sentence, is probably in pretty badshape,(ii)    If we do not get him out in this w  y, we probably nevershall.    We have no more cards, economic or other,to play.(iii)    The Hungarians are not free agents.    This deal hasalmost certainly been arranged in Moscow.H.M, Minister at Budapest considers that the communists dare not accept anything but a politicalquid pro quo.
(iv)    If we do get Sanders out in this way, we can gettwo further advantages:(a) we can show that our trade ban has sohurt the Hungarians that they have hadto get permission from Moscow to finda way out;  this is a possible assuranceagainst further arrests;(b) we can resume trade;  the ban hurts us,tuough less than it does the Hungarians.(v)    We could in fact claim that we gave less than the americans did in the parallel case of Mr. Vogeler(they lifted the travel ban on American citizensvisiting Hungary, re-opened the Hungarian Consulates,altered the frequency of a United States broadcastingstation, and facilitated the restitution of Hungarianestates in Germany).    We shall merely have handedover a Communist and agreed to resume trade with-out agreeing to any trade concessions.    (Nor,incidentally, does it follow that we should have tomake the resumption of trade part of the formalbargain.)4.        H.M, Minister at Budapest has enquired of the Hungarian Minister forForeign Affairs, as from himself, what would be his attitude towards thedespatch of I_.ee ment to China rather than to Hungary as had originally been proposed.    The Minister for Foreign Affairs did not in any way seem to reject this idea but he thought that technical details of this nature should awaitagreement in principle.    He is clearly anxious for an early settlement.5.        One of the possible objections to carrying out the proposed exchangehas been that it might prejudice the safety of other British subjects inCommunist countries, particularly in China.    H. M. Representative at Pekinghas been consulted and his view, which is given in the annexed telegram is thatsuch a precedent, while undesirable in principle and capable of adding to the uncertainties and anxieties of their existence, would not necessarily greatly increase the perils of British residents in China.S.L.Foreign Office, S.W.1.11TH MARCH, 1953.
TEXT OF PEKING TELEGRAM TO FOREIGN office no. 139 dated 2nd March, 1953The Hungarian Governments offer of exchange of British subject in prison for the Chinese Communist woman in Malaya.This would inevitably create precedent with dangerous potentialities.However, I would personally doubt whether it would necessarily result inexposure of British subjects in China to greater danger of arrest as hostages.The Chinese Government might, however, take it into their heads to initiatesimilar deals for British political prisoners already in their hands such asFord and Bull.2.        I would mainly base the above opinion on the consideration thatrepeated proposals for similar exchanges of Chinese terrorists, even ifcommunicated through third party, could be readily interpreted as admissionof the Chinese Government&apos;s support of the terrorists in Malaya.    Moreover,the Chinese Government, in the present circumstances, may be reluctant to expose themselves to the dilemma of having to negotiate any exchange of Britishsubjects imprisoned in China, either with Her Majesty&apos;s Government direct,which though correct is likely to be politically unpalatable to them, or through a third nation, which might involve embarrassing loss of face.3.        In any case I think it would be reasonable to assume that the ChineseGovernment would not wish to resort to this expedient unless on behalf of someChinese prisoner regarded by them as of particular importance.    But ii:er-vention of the Hungarian Government would, prima facie, nevertheless dependon such special individuals valuation, though the motive may be more widelypolitical and not therefore influenced by the sex of the prisoner.    Even the refusal to exchange the woman might be exploited for anti-British propaganda.There are of course parallel risks, if she were released she would be able to spread false and lurid stories of her experiences in prison, etc., to Chinese and other Eastern audiences.5.       I have not attempted to assess repercussions in Malaya or to take intoaccount relative importance of the   two individuals concerned.    From the purelyChinese point of view my conclusion would be that such a precedent, whileundesirable in principle and capable of adding to the uncertainties and anxietiesof their existence, would not necessarily greatly increase the perils of Britishresidents in China.6.        If it is decided to effect the exchange it seems to me essential that weshould seek to mitigate the adverse effects upon public opinion by suitablepublic presentation.    For instance, it might be of psychological importancein the interest of British subjects in China if, in explaining the action, emphasiswere placed on the exceptional nature of the case, on the female sex of the prisoner and on traditional British clemency and the practice of giving thebenefit of the doubt wherever possible (relevant item in law, reported in the times of 18th February, suggests possible opening in this context ).    Similarly,it would be definitely preferable if the death sentence could be commuted beforethe exchange were agreed, so that the status of the two persons as long-termprisoners might be more closely approximated, though this expediency may be impracticable on technical grounds.    The Chinese are naturally inclined to theprinciple of an eye for an eye, so that disparity between each side of a bargainshould be disguised as far as possible.    In any case such an exchange, of whichthe political basis would be difficult to disguise, must serve to strengthen Chineseconviction that our insistence upon the independence of British judiciary from political influence is an official fiction.    Practical effect of this single factor,however, need not necessarily cause undue concern.
