(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL.Co (53)95 COPY NO. ^X)1QTH MARCH t 1953CABINETKOREA;    TRIALS OF PRISONERS OF WAR IN THE custody of UNITED NATIONS forces memorandum by the Minister of state the United States Government have authorised theGommander-in-Chief, United Nations Command, to set upGeneral Military Commissions for the trial of prisoners ofwar for crimes of violence committed since capture.Governments with forces in Korea undei* the United NationsCommand have been invited each to nominate one officer toserve on the Commissions*2.     The United States Government have been informed thatthis proposal raises difficult legal and political problems for Her Majesty&apos;s Government and have been asked not to makeany public announcement about the proposed Commissions until we have given them our considered views.3.     The Foreign Secretary has discussed the matter withMr* Dulles, and has asked me to refer it to Cabinet,L.     Arguments against the United States Proposals(a) It was the deliberate purpose of the 19h9 geneva convention to place the responsibility for the treatmentof prisoners of war on a single Detaining Power.     Thedrafters of the Convention were particularly careful to rule out any joint responsibility.     It is obviously in theinterests of our own prisoners of war, now and in future,to maintain intact the Geneva Convention, in particular theprovision that responsibility for their treatment cannot be shared between several Powers,(b) If the United States is regarded as the detaining power, there need be no departure from the letter of theConvention,,     Chinese and North Korean prisoners of war could then be tried by courts set up in accordance with UnitedStates military procedure, composed of United States officersand applying United States military law.     On the other hand the United Nations as such, if it were to be regarded as the detaining Power, has at present no code of military law.(c) It would be contrary to both the letter and thespirit of the 19^4-9 Convention to convene special courts(i0e0 courts other than the normal military and civil courts of the Detaining Power) to deal with prisoners of war.(d) Any foreign officers co-opted to serve on the suggested courts would be unfamiliar with United States legalprocedure, which it is proposed to use, and might have littlepower over the conduct of caseso
(e)    The prisoners of war camps in Korea are administered, by the United States because they provide the unified Commando     It is inconsistent of them to suggestthat other countries should participate in the trials ofprisoners, when they do not suggest that the responsibilityfor administering the camps, for discipline and for selectingcases for trial should also be shared.5.     Arguments for the United States Proposals(a) The state Department would evidently be verydisappointed if we did not accept their suggestion.     Wehave so often to oppose American proposals in connexion withPar Eastern policy that we should meet their wishes whenever possible,,(b) It is the general policy to emphasise at every opportunity the Joint responsibility of the United Nationsaction in Korea.(c) It would be awkward to Justify publicly the rejection of an invitation to appoint members of the&quot; suggestedcourts if other countries were to accept it.(d) By the Geneva Convention of 1949 prisoners of war may be tried for offences committed after capture under themilitary law of the Detaining Power.     The circumstances in korea are such as were net envisaged at the time when the geneva Convention was drawn up;    in particular, it can beheld that the Detaining Power in Korea is not any singlecountry, but the United Nations.     Consequently, theestablisnment of courts composed of representatives of several nations, though not in accordance with the letterof the Geneva Convention, would be quite in accordance with -its spirit.conclusion.     This proposal therefore raises in an acute form thequestion, which we have not before had to answer, whether for the purposes of the Geneva Conventions on the Treatmentof Prisoners of War, the Detaining Power on our side in the korean conflict is the United Nations acting through theUnited States Government or the United States Government acting on behalf of the United Nations,      I am informed that from thelegal and technical points of view either thesis would betenable.     We can therefore reach a decision on the UnitedStates Governments proposal for mixed commissions on grounds of general policye7.     Since the responsibility for dealing with the prisoner of war problem in Korea has so far been assumed almost exclusively by the Americans, it would have been preferable that this should continue.     It would however be mostembarrassing if Her Majesty&apos;s Government were to stand outalone.     Furthermore, the kind of collective action now being conducted in Korea is without precedent, and a certain amountof improvisation to meet a situation not contemplated by existing international law has been inevitable.
8.     The Foreign Secretary realises the many difficulties involved in this proposal.     He has also recently dissussedthis with his Canadian colleague who shares our hesitations.They both feel that we must stand together, but equally thatwe do not want to be the only countries to stand out, andthey recognise the importance which the new United states administration evidently attach to their proposal as partof their policy for Korea.     As regards the views of other commonwealth Governments, it is known that the australian government are anxious for Commonwealth consultation before they reach any final decisionj    and the New Zealand Governmenthave no objection to the United States proposal but will notbe able to provide suitable officers.recommendations.     It is recommended that we should inform the commonwealth governments concerned as well as the Governments of Franceand Turkey that Her Majesty&apos;s Government would prefer the trial of these prisoners to.be carried out by exclusivelyAmerican courts, and we should ascertain their views.      Ifas a result of these consultations it is found that, exceptfor Canada, the other countries consulted favour theUnited States proposal and intend to participate in theproposed mixed courts, it is further recommended that theForeign Secretary should have discretion to agree also onbehalf of Her Majesty1s Government in the United Kingdom.S.L.Foreign Office, S.W.1.10TH MARCH, 1953*
