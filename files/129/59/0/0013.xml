COTTON:  IMPORTING AND MARKETING ARRANGEMENTSMemorandum by the President of the Board of Trade and theMinister of MaterialsThe present position of the Raw Cotton Commission gives rise to serious problems which we feel bound to bring to the notice of our colleagues.    At thetime of the last General Election we stated that our policy was to re-establish andre-open the Liverpool Cotton Exchange.    But chiefly because of the foreign exchange position we were not able to do this immediately.2.        We were faced a year ago with a serious recession in the textile industryand a difficult political decision as to the future methods of purchasing raw cotton,,We sought and succeeded in getting the support of all interests, including the tradeunions, to an objective study of the issue.    A Committee was set up representativeof all sides of the Lancashire industry, under the Chairmanship ofSir Richard Hopkins, to advise us how, in the current foreign exchange position,cotton could best be supplied to the United Kingdom cotton industry on the most advantageous terms as to quality and price.    This Committee produced a unanimous report, the recommendations of which the Government accepted in fulland have since put into operation.3.        The main change in policy thus made was to allow any spinners who desired to &quot;contract out&quot; and buy their cotton privately, while the Raw cotton commission continued to supply the others and to provide &quot;cover&quot; for all alike.4.        The Hopkins Committee thus obtained agreement to break the monopoly of the Raw Cotton Commission in the purchase of raw cotton.    Up to the present about 30 per cent of the trade has been buying privately.    The scheme has been working smoothly.    We are* however, reliably informed - and indeed it appearsto b.e common talk in Lancashire 7 that when the time comes for spinners to make their option for the next cotton buying season a much higher proportion may decide to buy privately, possibly up to 60 per cent of the trade.    The time forexercising the option will be in May and June;  the buying season begins inSeptember.5.        We have had this situation examined by an Inter-departmental working party which comprised representatives of the Ministry of Materials, Board ofTrade, Treasury and the Bank of England and had the assistance of the chairmen of the Raw Cotton Commission and the Cotton Board in their personal capacities.Its conclusions may be summarised as follows:-(a)  If private purchase increases, as is expected, the responsibilities of the Raw Cotton commission will have to be radically changed.    Since it will no longer be a monopoly, it must be relieved ofsome of its present statutory obligations tosupply raw cotton to all comers.    This will involve legislation.COPY NO.M)to (4CABINETSECRETC.(53) 6316TH FEBRUARY, 1953
(b) &quot;Cover&quot; of some sort is essential for Lancashire.It is the means whereby the user of raw cottoncan insure against rapid variations in the priceof his raw material.    In the present balance ofpayments position the Liverpool Futures Marketcannot re-open and there is therefore no alterna-tive to the continuance of a Government &quot;cover&quot;scheme.    (Government money is already at riskin the Commission^ existing &quot;cover&quot; scheme and stocks, and the continuance of the &quot;cover&quot; scheme will not necessarily involve any increase in risk.)(c) So far, in order to put the Hopkins scheme into operationwe have relied on certain escape provisions of theCotton (Centralised Buying) Act, 1947.    It is clearthat the Raw Cotton Commission would be operatingcontrary to the spirit if not the letter of the Act if further substantial encroachments on its monopolywere to come about as a result of increased&quot;contracting out&quot;.    It will, therefore, be necessarysooner or later to legislate to remove the monopolyprovisions of the Act.6.        In accordance with the recommendations of the Working Party we propose:-(a) that an immediate announcement should be made to theeffect that &quot;cover&quot; facilities will be available tothe trade during the buying season which beginsin September, 1953;(b) that after suitable soundings have been taken with the spinners, merchants and trade unions separatelya Review Committee on the lines recommended inthe Hopkins Report should be set up and asked toreport by about the end of June.7.        The question of &quot;cover&quot; for spinners buying their cotton privately wasconsidered by the Hopkins Committee and would require consideration by the review Committee.    It would not be possible, therefore, to settle finally the precise form of &quot;cover&quot; to be given during the 1953/54 season until after the review Committee had reported.    Yet the announcement that some form of&quot;cover&quot; is to be provided will need to be specific enough to enable spinners totake their decision about buying privately or through the Raw Cotton Commissionin the season 1953/54;  it would be stated that    &quot;cover&quot; will be made available forthe 1953/54 season on a similar but not necessarily identical basis as is being provided for spinners buying privately in the season 1952/53.8.        We have consulted the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the question of&quot;cover&quot;.    Much as he dislikes the use of public funds to protect a single industryagainst losses through fluctuation in the price of raw materials, he is satisfiedthat &quot;cover&quot; arrangements for Lancashire are essential and that, given theimprobability of opening the Liverpool Cotton Exchange in time to cover theoperations of the buying season 1953/54, and the absolute impossibility of decidingnow that it would be practicable to do so, he is content that an announcement on thelines we propose should be made at an early date.
9.        The Hopkins Committee itself recognised that foreign exchange difficulties might persist for a considerable time and accordingly recommendedthat when adequate time had elapsed for some experience of their plan to be gained there should be a further review of the situation.    We are informed thatthe trade union representatives on that Committee attached great importance tothat recommendation.    In any case the Government accepted the Hopkinsrecommendations as a whole and are, therefore, committed to a further review at the appropriate time.10.        We foresee little difficulty in persuading the spinners and the merchantsto collaborate in a further review.    If, however, the Review Committee is to fulfil its main purposes its terms of reference must be wide enough to allowconsideration of the future of the Raw Cotton Commission as well as the questionof &quot;cover&quot;.    Since it appears that the situation may be likely to justify a recommendation which would lead to a radical alteration in the functions of the raw Cotton Commission - or even to its winding up - it will not be easy to securethe participation of the trade union representatives in the work of the Committeewhich might lead to this result, particularly since they cannot fail to have noticedthe considerable volume of publicity in this direction recently appearing in thepress.    In any case serious difficulties may be expected to arise in achievingagreed recommendations by the Review Committee.11. The terms of reference given to the Review Committee are, therefore,a matter of importance.    We suggest that they might be on the following lines:-&quot;To consider whether within the framework of thereport of the Hopkins Committee any change would bedesirable in the obligations and duties at present imposed on the Raw Cotton Commission, with respect in particular to the supplying of cotton and providing &quot;cover&quot; to theUnited Kingdom cotton industry in the event of asubstantial increase in&apos;contracting out; and to make recommendations. &quot;We would not propose to settle the terms of reference finally until we had hadpreliminary discussions with the interests concerned, but in these discussions wewould propose to make it quite clear that recommendations involving legislation would not be excluded.12,        If the Committee report by Junetthen their recommendations would formthe basis for:-(a) final decisions about the precise form and extentof &quot;cover&quot; for the 1953/54 season; and(b) new legislation to replace the Cotton (CentralisedBuying) Act.13.        It would be necessary to keep as short as possible the period during whichthe Raw Cotton Commission was working contrary to the spirit, if not the letter,of the existing Act, and we consider that it would be essential for the Bill giving effect to the new legislation to receive a second reading before Christmas, 1953 .and to become law by the middle of 1954.    We consider that such legislation will be needed in any case, whether or not we succeed in getting an agreed reportfrom the Review Committee.    If &quot;contracting out&quot; increases substantially inMay and June it will, in our view, be impossible to justify continuing further underthe present Act (which regards monopoly buying as the rule rather than theexception and which, as counterpart to this monopoly right, imposes obligationson the Raw Cotton Commission towards spinners which it could no longer fulfil)unless it is announced that legislation is to be introduced.
14.        While there is no certainty that a Review Committee fully representativeof the Lancashire cotton trade, including trade unions, can be assembled toconsider these matters - or even, if this is achieved, that it would be possible for it to reach agreed recommendations - the course we propose offers, in our view,the best prospects&apos;of keeping political controversy to a minimum.Summary15.        We accordingly propose(a) that we should, before doing anything else, seek to obtain the agreement of the interests concerned to the course of action proposed;(b) that, with the maximum support we can get, a review Committee, as nearly as possible thesame as the Hopkins Committee, should beset up, with terms of reference on the linesstated;(c) that the Government should announce the establish-ment of this Review Committee as soon aspossible, and at the same time make anannouncement about &quot;cover&quot; on the lines indicated in paragraph 7;(d) that time should be reserved in the parliamentary programme for the session 1953/54 for aBill amending the Cotton (Centralised Buying)Act, 1947, and that we should aim to take theSecond Reading of this Bill before Christmas.16.        We seek the approval of our colleagues to this course of action.P.T.A.S.16TH FEBRUARY, 1953.
