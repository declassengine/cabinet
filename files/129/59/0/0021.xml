Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1953SECRET .    Copy No.      gC. (53) 7119th February, 1953CABINETTHE FILM industry memorandum by the President of the Board of trade  decision has to be taken about the future of what is called. the &quot; EadyScheme,&quot; the origin and nature of which is described in the Annex to this paper.2. In its. present form, the Eady Scheme (referred to as &quot; the Scheme &quot;),although prompted and inspired by Government, and helped into existence byadjustments in the Entertainments Duty Schedule, is a voluntary agreement amongthe trade associations in the film industry. Its terms are approved by the Presidentof the Board of Trade. Exhibitors pay into the British Film Production Funda levy which is yielding at present just under  3 millions per year. This is distri-buted month by month, as it accrues, among the producers of British quota films,in proportion to the current net earnings of their films.3. The present agreement runs until August 1954. But it is argued by the producers that some announcement about its future must be made within the next three or four weeks for this reason. A producer who starts to plan a majorfilm now will not have it ready to begin earning money in much less than a year,and its main earning life will extend over at least eighteen months thereafter. Ifthe Scheme ended in August 1954, no film whose planning began now would benefitsignificantly from it. In these circumstances, the producers say that unless they know very soon that the Scheme will continue or its effects be otherwise secured they will be unable to initiate further productions, and within a very short time,British film production on anything more than a trivial scale will stop. Even ifthereafter the Scheme were revived, the hiatus would have dealt the industry a damaging blow.4. Discussions about the Scheme have been proceeding within the industry for a considerable time, and these have been useful in obtaining agreement on theway of settling various points which haVe created difficulty in its present operation,though some of these still remain unsettled. But on the cardinal issue what is to happen after August 1954-no agreement has been reached. Both exhibitors andproducers have now laid their case before the Board of Trade; and each side has asked that the Government should make the next move.5. The exhibitors&apos; case, in essence, is this: after the payment of Entertain-ments Duty at its present level, the total amount left as net box office receipts isnot sufficient to provide both for the costs of running cinemas arid a reasonablereturn to exhibitors and for a  3 millions levy for the benefit of producers. they say that the Entertainments Duty adjustments made as part of the introductionof the Scheme have yielded to the exhibitors very much less than was expected,but that the levy is in effect a fixed charge. Their figures are not very easy toifollow or to assess; but the broad effect of their case is that a substantial part ofthe  3 millions that goes into the British Film Production Fund is provided out ofmoney which should properly remain with them. They do not object in principle to continuing the Scheme for a year after August 1954, because they accept thenecessity of some special help for the producers.  But (i) they ask &quot;where is the43774 b
money to come from? &quot; implying that their agreement must be conditional onsomething being done for them in the Budget; and (ii) they are not in any casedisposed to commit themselves for more than one year at a time thus retaining the opportunity to perform the same operation year by year.6. The producers say that they pass no judgment on the financial arguments of the exhibitors indeed, they support the exhibitors&apos; claim that there ought tobe Budget concessions. But they say quite simply that the normal commercialmarket open to them, taking home and overseas together, does not, and cannot,whatever they do, yield enough to enable British film production to pay its way.The Scheme has just closed the gap. It gives them the possibility that, with carefuluse of their resources, energetic pursuit of their opportunities in the markets, and provided they produce good pictures, they might get out of the red. But it certainlydoes not yield them immoderate profits. With it, they say, they can continue ina modest way and with some basis of security. Without it, they must stop produc-tion. Moreover, without some assurance about its future soon, that day will notbe long delayed. And they ask that this assurance should be not merely for oneyear, but for a term of years.7. In asking my colleagues to consider what follows, I should like to begin by putting forward two basic propositions.  They are:  (i) That we*must maintain the policy of keeping alive a British film produc-tion industry of reasonable size, with the possibility of expansion. Thishas been accepted by every Government since 1927; and at first bymeans of the quota, and since the war by the provision of loan facilitiesthrough the National Film Finance Corporation, and by the promotion of the Eady Scheme, film production has been protected, encouragedand supported. I do not think that the case for the existence of this industry need be argued in extenso; I think we all recognise the grounds on which this case rests national prestige (which requires us tomaintain British films on the screens of the world as well as at home);dollar saving; and employment of highly skilled labour,(ii) That it is in fact impossible for the producers of British films to earn,year by year, enough money from the markets available to them tocover in total the costs of making a programme of films of the sizenecessary to keep a reasonably sized industry going. Certainly,individual films may yield very large profits indeed. But over the wholefield, and assessing the position of the industry as a whole, British film production cannot at this time survive without some special source of income over and above what it can earn in the normal way. In this,of course, British film production is in no different case from that ofevery other film industry in the world, save only that of the UnitedStates, and for precisely the same reason i.e., that the home market,which must in the nature of things be the main source of income, is far too small. British film producers have made not unsuccessful efforts to sell their films overseas, and certainly British films are second onlyto the Americans in their importance in international commerce. Aboutione-third of their earnings comes from overseas. But I am satisfiedthat there remains a gap, which can be closed only by special measures,between total earnings and costs.8. Although I have no doubt that special measures to increase the producers&apos;income are necessary, I cannot with the same certainty say that  3 millions a year,which is the amount currently yielded by the Scheme, is the right amount. Theavailable information goes to support rather than to refute this figure; but it is not sufficiently accurate or up-to-date to enable a firm judgment to be made. the producers have been asked to provide better supporting evidence for their viewthat this is the amount they need.9. If the premises set out in paragraph 7 are accepted, I think it follows thatwe must accept the producers&apos; case (i) that the Scheme, or something like it, must go on; and(ii) that they should have an assurance fairly soon that it will go on for areasonable period after August 1954.In my view, that period should be three years. Less than that would mean a repe-tition of the present uncertainties every year; more than that seems to me to be, too
long to look ahead when there are so many unknown factors of all kinds aboutthe whole future of film production, and so many developments television among them whose long-term effects cannot really be guessed.10. I have therefore considered the possible alternative means of procuringthe continuation of the Scheme.11. The exhibitors&apos; consent to the continuation of the Scheme in its presentvoluntary form could no doubt be obtained by making concessions to them onEntertainments Duty; and- provided that this consent could be obtained for aperiod of years such a solution would be acceptable also to the producers. ButI do not feel justified in pressing the Chancellor to authorise action on these lines.It would be bad in principle and dangerous in practice. It would openly establish a precedent for similar demands from the exhibitors in the future. And it wouldinvolve either making concessions in the 1953 Budget on account of an agreement which would not begin to take effect till August 1954, or making promises now about the Budget of 1954. The nature of the financial case made by the exhibitorsis certainly not sufficiently convincing that hardship is being suffered to overcomethese objections. Moreover, it seems to me of great importance that from now on, whatever may have happened at the inception of the Scheme, its future shouldbe dissociated from the level of Entertainments Duty, and that we should freeourselves from what would otherwise be an annual process of blackmail, based onuncertainty about the future of the Scheme. If the exhibitors have a case for relief,they should argue it with the Treasury like any other industry; their case shouldbe settled on its merits and not as part of a bargain involving simultaneously the fate of the producers.12. A possible alternative to using Entertainments Duty concessions as an inducement might be to use the threatened withdrawal of them as a lever. It wouldbe theoretically possible to say to the exhibitors that the adjustments in the Schedulewhich helped to bring the Scheme into being might, if they did not agree, to con-tinuing the Scheme, be revoked, with consequent disadvantage to them. Forexample, it might be suggested that the original Budget proposals of 1951 be restored (see Annex). I do not believe this is a practicable course. It is, of course,subject to the same objections of principle as its opposite, and like that, wouldirretrievably link the Scheme to the level of Entertainments Duty. But even if itsucceeded in coercing the exhibitors into accepting continuation of the Scheme, itwould leave extremely bad feeling in the industry. It would make genuine co-operation between producers and exhibitors, in working the Scheme very difficult;and indeed the exhibitors&apos; leaders might have insurmountable difficulties in securingthe support of their members in operating the Scheme. For these reasons, I donot advocate this course.13. If my colleagues agree with me so far that the Budget, either by induce-ment or by threat, should not be used as a weapon we are driven to consider theuse of direct Government action. We could either convert the Scheme, sub-stantially in its present form, into a statutory one: or we could create a directsubsidy to producers.14. A statutory levy has the attractions of certainty and straightforwardness.But it is also open to substantial criticisms on a number of grounds, of which theprincipal are: (i) that the Government is already, without such legislation, as deeplyinvolved in the film industry&apos;s affairs as is desirable; (ii) that any statutory scheme would be positively unwelcome to some sections of the industry and not whollyattractive to any; (iii) that it would be invidious to purport to redistribute by legis-lation the earnings of an industry as between different, sections for the exclusivebenefit of one section; (iv) that legislation would not in any case overcome thedifficulty of fixing the amount the producers should receive; and (v) that it would come perilously near to hypothecation of taxation.15. A direct subsidy, born either on the Board of Trade Vote or created by legislation, would avoid the criticism at (v) above. But it would otherwise be opento all these criticisms, and to many more, both of principle and of administration.In particular, it would expose the Government to requests from many quarters forthe direct subvention of objects at least as worthy. Further, it could open the doorto endless criticisms of support given to films which might cause offence on religious,political, moral, social, cultural, racial, aesthetic, or any other sectional grounds.43774        - b 2
16. Despite the difficulties which such a course would present, I am forcedto the conclusion that we must, in the last resort, be prepared to take powers toimpose a statutory levy. But I think that we should make every effort to avoidimposing such a levy, if we can. I therefore propose the following procedure,which would involve our making it clear to the industry that we were prepared totake powers to impose a statutory levy, and if necessary our doing so in theevent. On the other hand, it would, I hope, make it possible to secure a voluntary and workable agreement from within the industry.17.   I propose that:  (i) I should announce that the Government are satisfied that something likethe present Scheme must go on for a period of three years after August1954. The Government would be prepared to seek powers to achieve this, but hope that a satisfactory voluntary agreement from within theindustry will make that unnecessary.(ii) This announcement should be made as soon as possible and certainlybefore the Easter recess. This would at once put an end to the presentperiod of speculation about the Government^ attitude, avoid any possibility of serious dislocation in production, and take the wholequestion out of the budgetary sphere,(hi) In making this statement, I should be at pains to avoid committing theGovernment to any particular figure as being what was needed by the producers.(iv) Both sides should then be encouraged to make a fresh effort to reach agreement. The producers would be reminded that although their general case had been accepted, the validity of the figure of  3 millions which they claim had still to be established. The exhibitors would alsobe reminded that a voluntary scheme, even if it cost them more thanthey are at present disposed to pay might still be cheaper, as well asless onerous, than a statutory one.18. I think that there is a good chance that procedure on the above lines would lead to a satisfactory voluntary agreement from within the industry. Butwe should have to be ready to impose a levy if a satisfactory agreement werenot reached. This means that we must have in draft legislation empowering theBoard of Trade to impose such a levy after August 1954.19.   The major steps of policy for which approval is sought are therefore:  (i) The Government should, as soon as possible, make an announcement about their attitude in this matter, designed to remove the present uncertainty and so avoid the risk that producers will stop production.(ii) The onus for reaching agreement should be placed on the industry, andthey should be given all encouragement, short of the promise of Enter-tainments Duty concessions, to agree among themselves.(iii) Authority should be given for the preparation, and, if it should prove necessary, the introduction, of legislation for the establishment of a statutory scheme to work approximately on the lines of the presentvoluntary agreement.P.

annex the Eady scheme. The &quot; Eady Scheme &quot; was brought into existence in June 1950 as a resultof discussions among film producers, renters, exhibitors and the Government,represented principally by the Treasury (from whose spokesman in the meetingsit took its name). The objective was to provide to the producers of British filmsan increased share of the amounts paid by the public at the box office. In orderto make this possible, the Treasury agreed to adjustments in the EntertainmentsDuty Schedule which would (i) enable exhibitors to increase seat prices withoutmoving into higher duty ranges, and (ii) cost  300,000 in loss of revenue. It was estimated that these changes would provide altogether increased net box officereceipts of  3 millions. The agreement arrived at was that exhibitors would payable levy of %d. on each seat sold at all performances (whether of British or Americanfilms) into a central fund the British Film Production Fund; this would provideabout  1^ millions; and this amount would be distributed among British filmproducers.2. It should be noted that the Scheme could not have come into existencewithout the consent of the American distribution companies. It was a necessaryfeature of the Scheme that the amounts paid by exhibitors into the Fund shouldbe excluded from the calculation of film hire (normally calculated as a percentageof box-office receipts) due to distributors; and of course the greater part probablyabout three-quarters of the Fund accrued from the proceeds of showing Americanfilms.3. The original Scheme was agreed for one year only. But it was apparentto the Treasury and the Board of Trade that both a longer period and a greateramount of money were necessary to achieve the aim of making British film pro-duction solvent. In 1951, the Scheme was extended and enlarged, as the result of discussions which took place between the Budget and the Report Stage of theFinance Bill. The original Budget proposals imposed substantial increases in theCinema Entertainments Duty designed to yield to the Revenue about an additional 10 millions. Following discussions between the trade associations and theGovernment the Schedule was revised. It was then estimated that the revenue would get about an additional  6 millions, and that about the same amount would remain in the industry; under the new agreement among the producers, rentersand exhibitors which was to run for three years until August 1954, the levy was increased to %d. on seat prices over Is. Od. The British Film Production fund would, it was expected, thus receive, for distribution among producers, about 3 millions.4. In the event, the estimates of the effects of the changes in EntertainmentsDuty made in 1951 have not been realised, except that the British Film ProductionFund has received substantially the  3 millions expected. The revenue and theexhibitors have both got very much less than the estimates, chiefly because cinema-goers have tended to buy cheaper seats. . It is indeed impossible, on the figuresavailable, to say exactly how much less.5. In both the 1950 and 1951 schemes, it was agreed that some small partof the Fund might be reserved from distribution for certain special purposes. Themain use made of this has been to provide a yearly sum, in the current year 150,000, to the Children&apos;s Film Foundation, to enable the production of filmsspecially suitable for exhibition to children. Another use has been to enable theBritish Film Institute to establish the National Film Theatre by acquiring thecinema which was part of the South Bank Exhibition; the amount provided was 12,500.6. The administration of the Fund-which has been carried out with muchgreater smoothness and efficiency than might have been expected-is in the handsof a committee consisting of representatives of each of the four trade associationsin the industry, under an independent chairman (Sir Harold Barton) appointed bythe President of the Board of Trade.
