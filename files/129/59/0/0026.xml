(53) 7626th February, 1953INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE, GENEVA, JUNE 1951Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service this paper contains my proposals for action on the following conventions and Recommendations which were adopted by the 34th Session of the InternationalLabour Conference at Geneva in June 1951:  Convention (No. 99) concerning Minimum Wage-Fixing Machinery inAgriculture.Recommendation (No. 89) concerning Minimum Wage-Fixing machinery in Agriculture.Convention (No. 100) concerning Equal Remuneration for Men andWomen Workers for Work of Equal Value.Recommendation (No. 90) concerning Equal Remuneration for Men andWomen Workers for Work of Equal Value.Recommendation (No. 91) concerning Cpllective Agreements.Recommendation (No. 92) concerning Conciliation and Arbitration.2. The constitution of the International Labour Organisation requires member states to bring Conventions and Recommendations before the competent authorities within a year (or at most 18 months) of their adoption for the enactment of legis-lation or other action. The practice in this country for many years has been tocommunicate the Governments proposals on such instruments to Parliament bymeans of a White Paper.3. The texts of the Conventions and Recommendations were presented toParliament in March 1952 with the report by the Government delegates to the34th Session of the International Labour Conference, 195.1, (Cmd. 8484). Asummary of the provisions of the Conventions and Recommendations, andcomments on them giving the reasons for my proposals, are annexed. The proposals are as follows:  (1) that the Convention (No. 99) concerning Minimum Wage-Fixing machinery in Agriculture should be ratified, and that the supporting Recommen-dation (No. 89) should be accepted subject to reservations on two paragraphs;(2) that a decision should be deferred on the Convention (No. 100) and theRecommendation (No. 90) concerning Equal Remuneration for Menand Women Workers for Work of Equal Value;(3) that the Recommendation (No. 91) concerning Collective agreements should,   subject   to   certain   reservations,   be   declared   generally acceptable; and(4) that the Recommendation (No. 92) concerning Conciliation and Arbitrationshould be accepted.4. The ratification or acceptance of Conventions and Recommendations isundertaken on behalf of both Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The Ministryof Labour and National Insurance of Northern Ireland have been consulted andconcur in the action that is proposed.5. If the proposals are approved, authority is sought for the issue of a white paper, based in large part on the terms of the Annex, which I will circulate to mycolleagues in due course for information.W.

ANNEXConvention (No. 99) concerning Minimum Wage-Fixing Machinery in Agriculture1. The Convention provides that ratifying States shall have machinery for the fixing of minimum rates of wages for workers employed in agriculture and relatedoccupations. Provision is made, subject to safeguards, for the partial payment ofthe minimum wages in the form of allowances in kind where this is customaryor desirable. It is left to ratifying States to decide for themselves the nature and form of the wage-fixing machinery, but the Convention lays down certain conditionswhich must be satisfied in regard to the following: consultation with organisa-tions of employers and workers and with other qualified persons before themachinery is set up; participation of employers and workers in the operation ofthe machinery; and the binding nature of the minimum rates of wages fixed.Provision is made, however, for abatement of the minimum rates in the case of individuals who are physically or mentally handicapped. The Convention providesthat minimum rates of wages in force shall be made known to the employers and workers concerned, and that the necessary measures, including appropriate pro-vision for supervision, inspection and sanctions, shall be taken to ensure that theminimum rates are in fact paid.2. The law and practice of the United Kingdom are in accordance with theprovisions of the Convention, and it is proposed that the United KingdomGovernment should ratify it.Recommendation (No. 89) concerning Minimum Wage-Fixing Machinery inAgriculture3. The Recommendation is supplementary to the Convention. It deals withsuch matters as the factors to be taken into consideration in the fixing of minimum wage rates; participation of employers and workers in the wage-fixing machinery and in the nomination of representatives; impartiality and qualifications of independent persons appointed to participate in the wage-fixing machinery;periodical revision of the minimum rates of wages; publicity for the minimum rates;supervision of the rates actually paid and penalties for infringements; appointmentof inspectors; and the maintenance by employers of records of wages paid.4. The law and practice of the United Kingdom are, in general, in accordancewith the Recommendation, and it can be accepted subject to the following point: -Paragraph 1 of the Recommendation states that it is desirable that the wage-fixing body should take into account the necessity of enabling the workers con-cerned to maintain a suitable standard of living. Paragraph 2 specifies certainfactors to be taken into consideration in the fixing of minimum wage rates. Theseare matters which in the United Kingdom are left to the complete discretion of theAgricultural Wages Boards. The Government would not wish to express any opinion on the particular matters mentioned in these paragraphs or to accept an obligation to specify factors which the Boards should take into consideration.5. It is proposed that the United Kingdom should accept the Recommenda-tion, subject to a reservation on paragraphs 1 and 2.Convention (No. 100) and Recommendation (No. 90) concerning Equal Remunera-tion for Men and Women Workers for Work of Equal Value6. The Convention lays down certain general principles in regard to equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value. This term is defined in Article 1 as referring to &quot; rates of remuneration established without discrimination based on sex.&quot; The central provisions of the Convention are con-tained in Article 2, which provides that each member shall, by means appropriate to the methods in operation for determining rates of remuneration, promote and,in so far as is consistent with such methods, ensure the application to all workers of the principle of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value. This Article also sets out the various means by Which the principlemay be applied. Article 3 provides that, where such action would assist in giving effect to the provisions of the Convention, measures ,shall be taken to promoteobjective appraisal of jobs on the basis of the work to be performed.   Article 4
provides for co-operation, as appropriate, between Governments and employers&apos;and workers&apos; organisations concerned for the purpose of giving effect to theprovisions of the Convention.7. The Recommendation sets out procedures for the progressive applicationof the general principles laid down in the Convention. It is provided in the preamble to the Recommendation that these measures should be applied subjectto the provisions of Article 2 of the Convention.8. Paragraphs 1 to 4 of the Recommendation deal with the application ofthe principle of equal remuneration to central and local government employees,and to occupations in which rates of remuneration are subject to statutory regula-tion or public control; the general application of the principle of equal remunerationby means of legal enactment, where appropriate; and the progressive introductionof equal remuneration. Paragraph 5 deals with the establishment, where appropriate, and in agreement with the employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations concerned, of methods for objective appraisal of work to be performed, Whether byjob analysis or by other procedures. Paragraph 6 contains certain recommenda-tions regarding facilities for the vocational guidance, vocational training andplacement of women workers, social and welfare services for women workers, andequality of access of men and women workers to occupations and posts. Para-graph 7 provides that every effort should be made to promote public under-standing of the grounds on which it is considered that the principle of equal remuneration should be implemented. Paragraph 8 provides for the undertaking of such investigations as may be desirable to promote the application of theprinciple of equal remuneration.9. The broad purpose of the Convention, so far as it relates to directlyemployed Government staff, is in line with the repeatedly expressed view of her majesty&apos;s Government that, as and when it is practicable, the principle of equal pay should be introduced in the Civil Service. On the other hand, it is clearlyimpossible even to begin implementing this principle so long as our economicand financial situation remains precarious and there remains the need for utmoststability in wages and salaries. This makes it impossible to ratify theConvention at the present time, and it is therefore not necessary at present to decide whether, if equal pay were introduced into the Civil Service the position outsidethe Civil Service would make it possible and desirable to ratify.10. As regards the Recommendation, it is not necessary (as in the case ofa Convention) for a Government to accept it as a whole, and it would be possibleto indicate in detail the Government^ views on the various points contained inthe Recommendation. On the other hand, the Recommendation, according toits own preamble, is intended to suggest certain procedures for the progressiveapplication of the principles in the Convention, and a number of the specificprovisions contained in the Recommendation would cause considerable difficulty to us in the light of the long established practice of this country for determiningwages.11. It appears convenient, therefore, to deal with the Recommendationtogether with the Convention. It is proposed for the present merely to state thatthe wider obligations envisaged in the Convention and Recommendation willrequire careful consideration, but that, until conditions are such as to enable her majesty&apos;s Government to proceed with the introduction of equal pay in theGovernment Service, it is necessary to defer a decision with regard to theseinstruments.Recommendation (No. 91) concerning Collective Agreements12. Paragraph 1 of the Recommendation provides that machinery appropriate to the conditions in each country should be established, by means of agreement orlaws or regulations, to negotiate collective agreements, or to assist the parties in the negotiation of such agreements. Paragraph 2 defines the term &quot; collective agree-ments &quot; for the purposes of the Recommendation. Paragraph 3 provides thatcollective agreements should bind both the signatories, and those on whose behalfthe agreements are concluded; employers and workers should not be able toinclude in contracts of employment stipulations contrary to the collective agree-ment, and any such stipulations should be regarded as null and void; terms andconditions more favourable to the workers than those provided for in the collective agreement should not be regarded as contrary to it.  Paragraph 4 deals with the
application of collective agreements to all workers of the classes concerned employedin the undertakings covered by the agreement. Paragraph 5 provides for measuresto be taken, where appropriate, for the extension of collective agreements to all employers and workers included within the industrial and territorial scope of theagreement. Paragraph 6 provides that disputes arising out of the interpretation of agreements should be submitted to the appropriate procedure for settlementestablished either by agreement between the parties, or by laws and regulations, asmay be appropriate under national conditions. Paragraph 7 provides that theapplication of collective agreements should be ensured by the employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations concerned, or by the bodies existing in each country forthe purpose, or by bodies established ad hoc. Paragraph 8 deals with other mis-cellaneous matters for which national laws and regulations may provide.13. It is not proposed to introduce legislation to give effect to any of theprovisions of this Recommendation. The greater part of them deal, in any case,with questions which, in this country, are regarded as the proper responsibilityof the two sides of industry. It is important that the Government should not give any grounds for the belief that they are proposing to interfere with, or to supplement, the existing voluntary processes of industrial relations. At the sametime, it is proposed that, in announcing its attitude to the Recommendation, theGovernment, should indicate those principles embodied in it with which the Gov-ernment, for their part, are generally in accord.Recommendation (No. 92) concerning Conciliation and Arbitration14. The Recommendation provides that voluntary conciliation machineryappropriate to national conditions should be made available to assist in the preven-tion and settlement of industrial disputes between employers and workers. Theprocedure should be free of charge and expeditious, and provisions should be madefor it to be set in motion either by any of the parties to the dispute or ex officioby the voluntary conciliation authority. The parties in a dispute should be encouraged to refrain from strikes and lockouts while the conciliation procedure isin progress. The Recommendation further provides that, where a dispute has beensubmitted to arbitration for final settlement with the consent of all parties, the parties should be encouraged to refrain from strikes and lockouts while the arbitration isin progress and to accept the arbitration award. The Recommendation states thatits provisions are not to be interpreted as limiting in any way the right to strike.15. The law and practice of the United Kingdom are in conformity with theprovisions of the Recommendation and it is proposed that the United KingdomGovernment should accept it.
