IXoPrinted for the Cabinet,   February 1953CONFIDENTIALC. (53) 7726th February, 1953CABINETICELAND FISHERIES DISPUTEtMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Iceland Government have now replied to the suggestion made to themby Her Majesty&apos;s Government at the end of January that the Faxa Bay base-line should be referred to the International Court of Justice.2. The Iceland Government state that they are ready to discuss with her majesty&apos;s Government in what way the matter should be laid before the Inter-national Court on condition that the landing ban would be lifted immediatelyagreement had been reached upon the form of the submission. They have amplifiedthis formula in the following manner: they ask (a) that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould undertake that the landing ban would be lifted when the form of submissionhad been agreed; or (b) that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should see to it that theBritish trawler owners would guarantee to lift the ban at that time; or, as a mini-mum condition, (c) that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should give a guarantee inone form or another that the ban would be lifted when the International Court gaveits final ruling. If Her Majesty&apos;s Government cannot agree to give any of these three alternative guarantees, the Iceland Government would see no object in sub-mitting the dispute to the Court. Further, the Iceland Government have not yetagreed that the Faxa Bay base-line should be the sole issue to be laid before theCourt, but consider that this should be the subject of discussions between the twoGovernments.3. It is therefore not certain either that the Iceland Government (who cannotbe compelled to go to the International Court) will agree to go to the Court at all or that they will agree only to go, as Her Majesty&apos;s Government wish, on the FaxaBay base-line issue. The situation therefore seems to hinge upon whether her majesty&apos;s Government can give any guarantee about the raising of the ban onlandings in this country, and if so, in what form.4.   There appear to be two alternative courses of action:  (a) Her Majesty&apos;s Government should reply to the Iceland Government, with- -out approaching the British fishing interests, that they could not compelthese interests to lift, or to guarantee to lift, the ban. They could not go further than the statement made by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the Iceland Minister inLondon on 20th January, viz., &quot; Her Majesty&apos;s Government would accept the judgment of the Court and, while they could give no under-takings, they would expect the industry to do likewise.&quot; They should say that their proposals offered a possible means of eventually settling the dispute, and no alternative method of doing so had yet beensuggested by the Iceland Government. But they were not preparedto discuss the form of the submission to the Court and must requestan assurance from the Iceland Government that they agreed to submit the Faxa Bay question alone.(b) A meeting should be arranged with the British fishing interests at which ministers should explain the present position and seek to obtain as firman undertaking as possible that the ban would be lifted after a Hague43806Copy No.    ? 0
Court ruling. Armed with such an undertaking, the Iceland Govern-ment would then be requested to give an assurance that they agreedto submit the Faxa Bay question alone to the International Court.5. I realise that the chances of getting a further, or indeed any adequate;assurance from the British fishing interests at the present stage, in the senseindicated in paragraph 4 (b), are small. On the other hand, the Iceland Govern-ment are unlikely to be satisfied with the repetition of what was said to them on20th January as reported in paragraph 4 (a), and it would at least be something to be able to tell them that we had again had discussions with the British interestswith the aim of impressing the Governments viewpoint on them.6. I have discussed this with the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, whothinks that, if we are to have any success on the lines indicated in paragraph 4 (b),he and I should make a joint approach to the British interests. This would coverall the factors at present affecting our position as a fishing nation. Our aim wouldbe to convince the British interests that the present proposals for dealing with the Iceland question offer the best, and perhaps the only hope of improving our position.We should hope, therefore, that the British interests will not make it impossible,by refusing to lift the ban following a Hague Court ruling, for us to get the Icelandersto the Court.recommendation. I ask my colleagues to agree that we should now proceed on the lines indicated in paragraphs 4 (b) and 6 above.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,26th February, 1953.
