UNITED NATIONS PERSONNEL policy memorandum by the Minister of state report recently circulated by the Secretary-General of the united nations  on Personnel Policy will be debated probably during the course of thisweek in New York.Recent actions in the United States2. During 1952 a special Federal Grand Jury investigated possible viola -tions of United States law by United States citizens who were members of the secretariat.    The Grand Jury found that there had been infiltration into theUnited Nations of a large group of disloyal United States citizens,    Th?Secretary-General&apos;s request for the evidence upon which this finding was basedwas refused.    The Internal Security Sub-Committee of the Senate JudiciaryCommittee also conducted investigations to determine &quot;whether United states citizens, even though they are United Nations employees, have been engagedin subversive activities which are clearly beyond the scope of their employmentsThis Sub-Committee examined 28 persons then or previously members of theUnited Nations staff.    Of these 17 claimed the constitutional privilege (underthe Fifth Amendment) against self-incrimination.    The Sub-committee reported on 2nd January, 1953 recommending that information respecting the loyalty of any American citizen employed by an international organisation shouldbe communicated to the proper authorities of that organisation and that legisla-tion should be passed to prevent the future employment by international organisations located in the United States of American nationals of questionableloyalty to the United States.   A Bill has been introduced in the United StatesSenate to give legislative effect to the report of the Sub-Committee.    on 9th January, 1953 an executive order was issued by the President authorising the transmission to the Secretary-General of the findings of loyalty boardstogether with the reasons therefor stated in such detail as security regulationspermit.The Secretary-Generals Report3. The Secretary-General in his report has tried to allay American fears.In his report he makes the following points:-. (a)    He upholds the international character and the independence of the Secretariat.(b)    He states that the Secretary-General should not retain a staff member in the employment of the United Nations ifhe has reasonable ground for believing that that staffmember is engaging or is likely to engage in subversive activities against any member Government.    He definessubversive activities as those directed towards the over-throw of a Government by force including conspiracytowards such overthrow and incitement and advocacy of it.COPY NO.confidential.(53) 842ND MARCH, 1953CABINET
(c) He points out that he has no investigating agency andthat he must depend upon member states for assistancein checking the character and record of staff members.(d) He states that there must be reasonable ground for believing accusations, that they must be supported by apreponderance of the evidence, and that evidence that anofficial had engaged in subversive activities in the pastwould not necessarily lead to a finding that he was likelyto be engaged in such activities either at present or inthe future.    He has already set up an Advisory Panelto which information of this nature with regard to staffmembers will be sent but he retains for himself the finaldecision in each case.(e) He proposes to rule that anyone who invokes the privilegeagainst self-incrimination has thereby shown his unfitnessfor public office and employment by the United Nations.This is in accordance with American practice.Instructions to United Kingdom Delegation4. The line which it is proposed that the United Kingdom Delegation shouldtake is as follows:-(i)     to agree with points (a), (b) and (d) above;(ii)     as regards (c) above, to state that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment are ready to co-operate with theSecretary-General in checking on request the recordsrelating to subversive activities of British subjectsemployed or seeking employment in the United Nations;Her Majesty&apos;s Government will be willing to furnish tothe Secretary-General in the case of any such UnitedKingdom national such particulars of his subversiverecord, if any, as are known to the United kingdom authorities in such detail as United Kingdom securityregulations permit;(iii)     as regards (e) above, to say that in practice it wouldbe difficult to maintain the high repute of the united nations Secretariat if it contained members who hadinvoked this privilege, and therefore, on balance,Her Majesty&apos;s Government support the Secretary-General^ proposition.5. It will be noted that it is not proposed that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould agree to give estimates of character or opinions with regard to staffmembers.S.L.Foreign Office, S.W.I.2ND MARCH, 1953.
