Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1953Copy No.   g 5CABINETCOMMERCIAL POLICY IN europe memorandum by the President of the Board of trade we are faced by considerable difficulties, political as well as economic, inEurope because of the way in which the trade situation is developing. The unsatis-factory state of trade and payments contributes to the general political malaiseand may well weaken the will to achieve desirable political objectives such as theEuropean Defence Community. It constitutes a specific threat to our exports,particularly of consumer goods, at a time when we can afford to lose no openingfor them. Furthermore there is a widespread distrust of our intentions as regardsthe Collective Approach; we are suspected of aiming to make sterling strong andscarce and safeguarding our own position by restrictive measures which would reduce our purchases from Europe.2. In these circumstances I think that we should consider, before the foreign secretary and the Chancellor go to Washington, both what steps we might takeat once to restore some measure of confidence and what might be necessary in the longer term.  A number of factors make this a matter of some urgency, notably (a) We are under increasing pressure in the Organisation for european economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.) to restore greater freedom to our trade and, in particular, to take immediate measures to assist Franceand Italy to earn sterling. As regards the latter, a formal letter has just been addressed to Her Majesty&apos;s Government by the Chairman ofthe Steering Board for Trade asking for a report by 4th March.(b) It has been made clear in the O.E.E.C. that there is now imminent dangerof a general reversal of current liberal trade policies in Europe; andthat, although our restrictions are not by any means the only factor,our policy is regarded as the key to the situation.(c) The French Ministers in their recent visit laid great emphasis on the damage which, in their view, our quotas are causing to the Frencheconomic situation. They are at present reviewing their own tradepolicies and have told us that they would be guided to a large extent by our actions. .(d) The new American Administration is constantly reiterating its desire fora more vigorous pursuit of &quot; European unity.&quot;(e) When Ministers go to Washington the impact on Europe of our plans and policies, including those relating to trade, will undoubtedly be a subject on which the Americans will question them closely.(/) Almost as soon as they return they will be even more closely examined at the meeting of the O.E.E.C. Council proposed for 23rd March.3. Clearly we must formulate our trade policies consistently with the objectives of the Collective Approach. This means, not only that we should do nothing now that would have to be retracted when the Collective Approach, is brought intooperation, but also, and more important, that we must do now whatever maybe necessary to make it possible, when the Collective Approach is applied, to assure43772SECRETC.

on the part of other countries the trade policies that will then be required. Forthese reasons, I think it is of immediate urgency to take action in Europe to avoid a further deterioration of the political situation and a general reversal of the liberaltrade policies that have been built up over the last four years.4. At the present time about 45 per cent, of our imports on private accountfrom Europe is free from quota restrictions, as compared with the minimum standard of 75 per cent, set by the O.E.E.C. The rate at which we can proceedtowards a fuller liberalisation must clearly depend upon our balance of payments position. We still need to win our way back from a debtor position in the european payments Union (E.P.U.) of  300 million including  100 million of gold. Never-theless, it seems reasonably certain that unless we can in the very near futuremake substantial progress in relaxing our restrictions, we must expect oneEuropean country after another to reverse its own liberal trade policies and soprecipitate a downward spiral of trade to the serious detriment of our exports.There would be a general revival of bilateralism and it would become extremelydifficult to achieve the multilateral objectives of the Collective Approach.5. It is not to be expected that we shall be able, in the field of Open GeneralLicences and quotas, to make a sufficient contribution to meet the real needs ofthe French and Italians in their present emergencies. If, therefore, the action thatwe do take is to have its full impact on European morale, I think it is most desirablethat we should make an effective gesture here and now; and for this purpose would strongly urge my colleagues to approve an increase forthwith in the touristallowance from  25 to  50. This would do more than any other single measure to give effective help and encouragement to France, and Italy also would standconsiderably to gain. I believe that politically such an action is fairly easilydefensible. It would be welcome to a wide cross-section of our own people who now like to spend their holidays abroad and I understand that the cost to our balance of payments would not be likely to exceed  10 million.6. Officials are already giving urgent consideration to the extent to whichwe can now remove or reduce our restrictions on imports with a view to providingMinisters with material for decisions after the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellorhave returned from Washington. In my judgment, however, it is most important that we.should give an encouraging answer to the O.E.E.C. when we report on 4th March. If we can by then announce the increase I have recommended&quot; in the tourist allowance, that may be a sufficient earnest of our intentions to preventprecipitate action by Italy and France before Ministers meet on 23rd March. Butif it appears to our representative on the Steering Board that, in order to hold the situation, some indication of our intentions as regards imports is necessary,I think he should have discretion to say that we are in fact urgently examiningour import arrangements and that Ministers will be informing the Council on23rd March of the results.7. It is, of course, impossible to be sure that, even if we do these things, weshall succeed in stopping the Italians, and possibly some others, from reimposingrestrictions over some part of their trade. What I would say is that those seem tome the best ways open to us in our present situation to try to hold the position,and that I think our chances should be reasonably good. But even if the Worstcame to the worst and there was some set-back to European, liberalisation, we should at least have achieved two important purposes. In the first place we should be able,as we should otherwise not, to satisfy Parliament and industry that we-had done all we reasonably could to keep the European markets open for Our export trade.Secondly, by demonstrating our loyalty to the ideals and objectives of the O.E.E.C.,we should and I think perhaps this is the most important consideration of all-have recovered in the Organisation the standing and authority that we shall needif we are to carry through successfully the delicate and difficult, negotiations that lieahead of us in connection with the Collective Approach.8. So much for our immediate problems in the short term But we need also,I think, to take stock of our general trade policies for the longer term in relation to europe. The Europeans have always felt that the present methods of liberalisation,with all the opportunities these afford for chopping and changing, are unsatisfactory;and that the purposes of liberalisation cannot be fully achieved unless we all enterinto some form of working agreement to co-ordinate the liberalisation undertaken by each of us and to assure a wide and stable.market for a series of important goodseffectively liberalised by all of us.   The Americans are sympathetic to this point of
view in so far as it approaches, more closely to their conception of &quot; integration &quot;and&quot;unity &quot;in Europe. I think we ought now to consider whether it would not be inour interest to co-operate with the Europeans in working Out common policies ofthis kind. What it would mean, in effect, is that we would bring together the schuman Plan countries and Switzerland on the one hand and the Scandinavians onthe other,.agree a list of goods for which a wide common market in Europe wouldbe likely to strengthen efficiency and productivity in Europe, and undertake tomaintain liberalised trade in these goods save in exceptionar emergencies. Weshould need to be ready to examine proposals to reduce particular customs duties&apos;where these were found to frustrate the common market, but any actual changes of tariff would have to be negotiated under the General Agreement on Tariff s and Tradeso as to ensure compensatory reductions, particularly in the United States tariff.There would be no question of creating any new discriminatory trade bloc or of instituting supra-national authorities to integrate our industries into those of theContinent.9. There are strong arguments in favour of the United Kingdom taking a new initiative in Europe in an attempt to create on these lines a wide European market for a range of goods in which such a market would serve to strengthen the economy of Europe as a whole.   I should mention, in particular:  (a) Paradoxically, convertibility, which we conceive as an element in the move towards a system of freer multilateral trade, will, as is already clear fromthe fears expressed in the O.E.E.C., put a severe strain on liberalisation of trade in Europe. Agreements to consolidate a minimum measure ofcommon liberalisation in Europe would both provide a firm foundation for liberal policies to survive and re-establish European confidence inour determination to sustain convertibility through the freeing and expansion of trade.(b) Failing some such initiative on our part, there may well be a tendency forthe principal European countries to go forward among themselves on the precedent of the Schuman Plan, thus leading to European arrangements&quot;:. from which we could not stand apart save to our own detriment and inwhich we should have little chance of participating on our own termsunless we had taken the initiative.(c) The more we keep out of European economic arrangements the moredominant will Germany tend to become and the more powerful will beGerman competition overseas.(d) On the political side we risk losing our influence in Europe and diminishingour influence with the United States if, in pursuit of our wider policies,we fail to take account of the aspirations and needs (as they see them) ofour European partners in the O.E.E.C.(e) It might help in dealing with Japanese competition in the future to have theinterests of the Europeans more closely bound up with our own.10. I appreciate that any constructive policy of this kind must involve sub-stantial risks for us. It would limit our freedom to restrict imports for balanceof payments reasons and might consequently distort severely the pattern of our trade if we had to reimpose such restrictions. It would be likely to involve us introuble with some of the particular industries affected. We might be pressed tomake tariff changes of a kind that would weaken the structure of Imperial Preference.Various risks of this kind are inevitable in any policies of acting by agreement inthe O.E.E.C., for such policies are bound to involve us in doing some of the things that the others want as well as getting them to do some of those that we want. Iwould not wish my colleagues to under-estimate these difficulties. The fact of thematter, as I see it, however, is that we have not a simple choice between taking risks and avoiding them: The choice, it seems to me, is between taking risks in relationto a constructive initiative under our own control and accepting whatever risks maybe brought to us by leaving the initiative to the other Governments of Europe.The Schuman Plan is a significant pointer to what these latter risks may be, nor should we delude ourselves that if we continued to stand out from a movement towards closer trade relationships in Europe the sympathy of the Americans would necessarily be with us.11. Against the political and economic background which I have outlined above it will, in my judgment, be necessary for us to do more than take immediate
Board of Trade, S.W. 1,19th February, 1953.action by increasing the tourist allowance and the rate of imports from Europe.&apos; i recognise that, because of the complexity of the factors involved, we could not evenhint at an initiative on the lines of paragraph 8 at the Council on 23rd March. i recommend, however, that we should set in hand at once a study of the balance of. advantages and objections which there might be in our undertaking a fresh initiative^ in the O.E.E.C. on those lines. If, as this study proceeds, it appears that usefulproposals are likely to emerge, I shall consider whether there would be advantage in taking soundings of industrial opinion and, if so, how this could best be done.12. In this connection it would clearly help us if Ministers could get some indication in Washington as to the likely reaction of the United States Adminis-tration to the various possibilities in the present European situation. Do they lookwith favour, or with some misgivings, on the possibilities of further integrationin &quot; Little Europe &quot; under Germany hegemony? Would they prefer to see Europedevelop liberalisation on a broader front? If so, would they, in the transitionalstages after convertibility, be more anxious to see liberalisation within Europesustained, even at the cost of some discrimination, or to move forward as rapidly as possible to non-discrimination even at the price of controlling imports from all sources? We cannot say more about our own policies than that we intend to playour part in preserving and promoting the, liberalisation of trade in Europe as abasis on which to build the full multilateral system we have in view; but we might,I suggest, indicate that any lead they can give us on the above questions would help us in defining the form and method by which we should seek to achieve the objectives in Europe.13.   I would summarise my proposals as follows :  (1) We should raise forthwith the tourist allowance to  50.(2) We should, in addition, be prepared, if necessary, to tell the O.E.E.C. on 4th March that we are urgently examining our import arrangements,and that Ministers will be informing the Council on 23rd March ofthe results.(3) We should at once undertake a study of whether it would be in our broadinterests to take a fresh initiative in Europe on the lines indicated inparagraph 8 above.(4) Ministers should endeavour in Washington to probe United States thoughton some of the major issues involved in European trade policy.P.
