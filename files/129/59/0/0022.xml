SECRET Copy  No.   6C. (53) 7224th February, 1953CABINETCOMMERCIAL POLICY IN europe memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations should like to put to my colleagues a variation of the method proposed by thePresident of the Board of Trade in C. (53) 70 for obtaining freer trade with Europe.2. Imaginative as the proposals in paragraph 8 of the presidents memorandum are, they involve considerable risks. The risks would be not nearly so great if we could confine our deal to the countries of Western Europe; but the risks become much greater if we have to give away by &quot; most-favoured-nation &quot;treatment to all the other countries which subscribe to the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) the concessions and advantages we give to and receive from Europe.3. If the Schuman Plan countries can obtain exceptional treatment from theG.A.T.T., and have special mutual arrangements in coal and iron and steel con-fined to themselves, why cannot we have similar exception for a European plancovering freer mutual trade in named articles?4. If we have to bring in all the G.A.T.T. countries as parties to and partici-pants in the arrangements, this will mean interminable negotiations: and it will alsomean either that we can&apos;t go as far as we would like to, if the arrangements were confined to Europe, or that we shall give away a good deal for nothing.5. Moreover, if we extend the concessions to all the G.A.T.T. countries, thatwill mean that Japan will have to be included sooner or later. This would makea lot of.mutual arrangements which it might pay us to have in Europe impossiblebecause of the risk of Japanese imports. This consideration is the more important as we have had a pretty sticky ride over Japan in the recent G.A.T.T. meeting.6. Surely too an arrangement which was confined to Europe should beagreeable to the United States? They are pressing us all the time to get closer to europe economically. They should surely welcome a proposal of freer trade between us and Europe.7. If we could get a special arrangement of this kind with Europe, it wouldappeal to people in our Party who hope eventually to see a three-tier system of-(a) imperial preference,(b) special arrangements between Europe and the Commonwealth,(c) the rest of the world.8. It also occurs to me that we might link our offer of freer trade with europe with an attempt to get the support of the European countries for the pro-posal we all agreed at the Commonwealth Conference for getting a limited release from the no-new-preference rule.S.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,24th February, 1953.43801Printed for the Cabinet,   February 1953
