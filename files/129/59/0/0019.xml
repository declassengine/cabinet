;AMNESTY FOR DESERTERSMemorandum by the Minister of DefenceWhen the Cabinet gave further consideration, on 18th December, 1952, tomy memorandum C.(52) 248, they decided in principle in favour of recommending that Her Majesty should grant some form of amnesty for men who had desertedfrom the Armed Forces in the war, as a special act of clemency in the year ofher Coronation.    I was invited to consider the procedure to be adopted to giveeffect to this decision (C. C. (52) 106th Conclusions, Minute 4).2.        I have consulted my Service colleagues and have discussed the matter with the Prime Minister.    In the light of those discussions my proposals are asfollows.3.        A public announcement should be made that the Government have decided,as a special measure which will not be regarded as a precedent for the treatmentof any war-time deserters in the future, that there will be no further prosecutionsof members of the Armed Forces who deserted from the Services between3rd September, 1939 and 16th August, 1945.4.        Men who wish to take advantage of the amnesty must report themselvesin writing to the appropriate Service authority.    They will then be issued witha protection certificate which will enable them to obtain ration books, national insurance cards, etc. in their correct names.    At the same time they would betransferred to the appropriate unpaid Reserve (Z, Z(T) or G, etc., to which all war-time conscripts were compulsorily transferred on release.5.        Men who, having surrendered or been apprehended during the specialclemency period in 1947,   were then tried and punished for war-time desertionand are still serving on Regular engagements, would be given the option of transferring to one of those Reserves.    Any who are awaiting trial or servingsentences for war-time desertion would be released from custody.6.        The amnesty for war -time desertion would not extend to any other offences against Service law or the ordinary criminal law.    There are clearly a number of offences which should not be covered by any such amnesty.    But menwho report themselves to the Service authorities should not be prosecuted for offences which are really consequential upon desertion, e.g. subsequentfraudulent enlistment or the possession of a false ration book, insurancecard, etc. , and the public announcement should make a suitable reference tothis.7.        No claim to Service emoluments, gratuities or other Service benefit in respect of any period prior to the date on which the amnesty becomeseffective will be admitted.COPY NO. Zj2. &apos; ?confidential.(53) 6920TH FEBRUARY, 1953CABINET
8.        These measures would apply only to the Forces raised in the UnitedKingdom.    The Colonial Secretary will no doubt wish to consider whether colonial governments should be invited to issue a similar declaration regarding desertersfrom Forces raised in the Colonies.    The Dominions should, I suppose, also beinformed of our proposal.9.        As the announcement of these measures may not be universally welcomeand may provoke protests from men who have served loyally throughout the war,it is undesirable that Her Majesty&apos;s name should be associated with it.10.        The completion of arrangements for the issue of the necessary.Departmental instructions will take about a month after the date when the cabinet have reached conclusions on the above proposals.A.Ministry of Defence, S. W. 1.20TH FEBRUARY, 1953.
