confidential.(53) 907TH MARCH, 1953CORONATION expenditure memorandum by the Financial Secretary, treasury as the Minister of Works is, I understand, circulating a paper about the coronation expenditure for which he is responsible, it may be convenient for theCabinet to have before them the estimates for the cost of the Coronation as awhole as they now stand.2.       The Cabinet were informed last November (C. (52) 397, Annex) of proposed expenditure totalling  1,684,000 net.    This, however, did not include expenditure arising out of certain subsequent Cabinet decisions (C.C.(52) 95thConclusions, Minute 1):-COPY NO. 66CABINET(i)   that Naval and R.A. F. Reviews should be held;(ii)   that the Minister of Education should pay granton reasonable expenditure by local educationauthorities on Coronation celebrations;(iii)    that charges for seats in Government standsshould be announced at  4 and  6, although thiswill not fully cover the cost of erecting the stands.These additions total over  350,000, bringing the total so far approved to about 2,050,000 net.3.        Appended to this memorandum is a table comparing this with the Depart-ments&apos; revised estimates, totalling  2,229,000 net.    I must draw attention to three particular points:-(a) The figures for the Ministry of Works (Coronation Vote)are those notified to the Coronation Preparations Committeeon 17th February, but I understand that the paper whichthe Minister of Works is circulating to the Cabinet showsfurther increases.(b) The large increase in the War Office&apos;s proposed expenditure.(c) The expenditure by the Education Departments depends upon decisions by local education authorities, and maywell be more or less than the  200,000 shown.    Themaximum liability was notified to the Cabinet inNovember as  360,000.
