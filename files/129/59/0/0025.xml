(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENT)secret.(53) 75 COPY NO.7Q25TH FEBRUARY, 1953CABINETSANDERS/LEE ment EXCHANGEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs have given further thought to this tragic problem.We have no further sanctions that we can impose upon Hungary.    Wehave stopped all trade.    Hungary has no Consulates to close.    We haverestricted the movements of their diplomats and we shall gain nothing byclosing their Legation.. 2.       The Hungarians might be willing to release Sanders in exchange forimportant concessions in the way of delivery of essential raw materials,e. g. they have hinted that they might do something for 5,000 tons of coppertogether with supplies of other strategic materials.    I do not think that wecan contemplate any deal of this kind.    We could not allow strategic rawmaterials to pass behind the iron curtain, even to save a man&apos;s life.3.       There remains only the possibility of this exchange.    As it seems tome, it could be viewed as an exchange of prisoners in the cold war.    Thereis a risk that the Hungarians might arrest other British subjects, but I do notrate it high now.    The numbers of British subjects in Hungary have been greatly reduced and travel behind the iron curtain, except by Communistsympathisers, is rare.    There is always of course a certain danger tojunior members of our own Legation staff, but to arrest one of them wouldbe another category of offence.4.       I am however concerned about the position of our businessmen inChina, and before finally advising the Cabinet again in the matter I would liketo consult Mr. Lamb, our representative in Peking.    I am doing this and will submit a further paper to the Cabinet when I have his reply.A.E.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.25TH FEBRUARY, 1953.
