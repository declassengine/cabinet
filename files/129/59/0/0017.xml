COPY NO.TREATY WITH LIBYAMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.In 1951 the former Government approved the text of a draft Treaty for negotiation with the Libyan Government.   Annexes I, II and III to this paper contain a revised draft Treaty and two related documents which the Libyan Council ofMinisters as a result of negotiations have now accepted and which the LibyanPrime Minister is ready to initial, pending the conclusion of subsidiary agreementsabout the military facilities we require in that country and the financialassistance we would give in return (see Article 3 of Annex I).2. The revised text of the Treaty is not materially different from the 1951draft, except that the duration is twenty instead of twenty-five years.   On thispoint I am satisfied that we could not do better.   The letters in Annexes II and IIIare new.   The Exchange of Letters about the Arab League (Annex II) is identical with the one annexed to the Treaty with Jordan, whose example in the League we expect Libya to follow.   The unilateral letter from H.M. Minister (Annex III)will not be published, although it would not harm us if it were:  it is merely adevice to avoid in the Treaty any &quot;guarantee of Libyan frontiers&quot;.3, Prompt acceptance of the Libyan Prime Ministers offer will confirmhis confidence in our good faith and tend to improve our chances of obtainingsatisfactory military facilities in negotiations now in progress.   Ever since thequestion of a Treaty was first broached we have proceeded on the basis thatwe shall need military facilities in Libya and are willing to give financial aid.Initialling of the Treaty would be one more step on this road, but the fact thatwe had initialled would probably not be made public at this stage and would notbe legally binding.4. Libya is expected to join the Arab League at the end of March and it isdesirable before then to bind her at leasy morally to the proposed relationship with us.   Initialling the Treaty is the best we can do, given the impossibility of completing the military and financial negotiations before the end of March andof formally signing the complex of Treaty and Agreements, which the LibyanGovernment wish to be done at one time.5.       The United States and French Governments, who are also seeking agreements with Libya in co-operation with us, are being kept informed and are not expected toraise valid objections to our initialling the Treaty.   They know that we have not yetcompleted all our negotiations and are unlikely to be able to do so until:afterMarch.   I shall approach my colleagues again when those negotiations are complete and signature is proposed.6. RecommendationI would ask my colleagues to-authorise the initialling at this stage of the revised draft Treaty and the tv/o related documents (Annexes I, II and III).Foreign Office, S.W.1.

ANNEX ii draft EXCHANGE OF NOTES (TO BE PUBLISHED)TO ACCOMPANY THE FOURTH DRAFT TREATY WITH LIBYAI.    From the Libyan Prime Minister to Her Majesty&apos;s MinisterYour Excellency,With reference to Article 4 of the Treaty signed to-day, I desireon behalf of my Government to state that the Covenant of the League of arab states signed on 22nd March, 1945, is included amongst the existing Inter-national Agreements to which this Article refers and is an agreement towhich in this connexion my Government attaches particular importance.Please accept^ Excellency^ the assurance of my highest considera-tion.II.   From Her Majesty&apos;s Minister to the Prime MinisterYour Excellency,I have the honour to acknowledge your letter of to-day&apos;s date, which reads as follows:-With reference to Article 4 of the Treaty signed to-day, I desireon behalf of my Government to state that the Covenant of the League of arab states signed on 22nd March, 1945, is included amongst the existing Inter-national Agreements to which this Article refers and is an agreement towhich in this connexion my Government attaches particular importance.Please accept, Excellency, the assurance of my highest considera-tion.
ANNEX IIIDRAFT NOTE (NOT TO BE PUBLISHED) FROM HER MAJESTY^ minister in LIBYA TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE MINISTER FOR FOREIGN affairs of THE UNITED KINGDOM OF LIBYA RELATING TO THEFOURTH DRAFT TREATY WITH LIBYAYour Excellency,I have the honour to refer to Article 3 of the Treaty which we have signed to-day, and to inform you that the insertion of a provision in that Articleto the effect that Her Majesty&apos;s Government would guarantee the frontier of libya against any aggression or threat of aggression would raise doubts as tothe precise meaning of Article 2 of the Treaty.    In particular, it might be held to imply that Article&quot; 2 is not intended to cover the provision of military assistance whereas there is, in fact, no doubt that it does.    Provisions of thekind which it has been suggestecf&quot;might be inserted in Article 3 were used inolder treaties concluded when international organisations such as the united nations did not exist, and are now out of date.    The meaning of the provision which has been suggested is obscure, since Her Majesty&apos;s Government could notrender the Libya frontier inviolable, and the degree of any military assistance which Her Majesty&apos;s Government would give to Libya if she were attackedcannot be assessed except in the light of Her Majesty&apos;s Governments owncapacity.    By contrast, Article 2 of the Treaty signed to-day makes it clear,in language which has become commonly accepted and understood in treaties and which is consistent with the United Nations Charter, that in the event ofwar or threat of war, Her Majesty&apos;s Government will do all they can to defendLibya from aggression.    It will be recognised that aggression against Libyais the only practical means by which she could lose territory.
