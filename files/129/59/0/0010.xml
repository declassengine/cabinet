SOTMIS ....iJ.?CUMJENT ig..-!11^.....PROPERTY OF HER  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1953CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.      iZC. (53) 60 I;13th February, 1953CABINETREVISION OF THE ARMY AND AIR FORCE ACTS:MUTINY .Memorandum by the Minister of defence the Select Committee on the Army and Air Force Acts have been discussing the death penalty for mutiny, and the Service Ministers and I think the cabinet should be aware of the views which the Select Committee have expressed on this important question, and of the reply which, if the Cabinet approves, it is proposedto make to them. 02. A copy of the relevant section of the existing Army and Air Force Actsis annexed. It will be seen that death is at present the maximum punishment for&quot;all offences of this nature, from violent mutiny in arms to the collective refusal of two or three men to obey orders in a relatively minor matter or the failureof someone present to use his best endeavours to suppress or prevent a mutiny.In practice the death sentence is rarely passed or carried out. .... ,: ,3. The Naval Discipline Act differs in various respects, e.g., it draws a dis-tinction between mutiny with violence, which carries the maximum penalty of death, and mutiny without violence, which does not, except for the ringleaders.4. The Select Committee have expressed the view that the death penalty formutiny should be confined in peace and war to the most serious offences, such asmutiny accompanied by violence or threat of violence or refusal to embark for service against an enemy; that failure of an officer or man to use his utmostendeavours to suppress a mutiny or to inform his commanding officer withoutdelay of a mutiny, actual or intended, does not in any case warrant the death penalty; and that the maximum penalty for endeavours to seduce a person fromallegiance to Her Majesty should be imprisonment, as under the civil law.5. The Service Departments agree in principle that the death penalty (as amaximum) can be confined to:  (1) Taking part in or inciting to take part in a mutiny accompanied by violenceor threat of violence or, in combination refusing or avoiding serviceagainst or in connection with operations against an enemy.(2) Knowing that a mutiny is taking place or is intended, with intent to assistthe enemy failing to use utmost endeavours to suppress or prevent it orto report it.For any other mutinous offences under the Army and Air Force Acts the maximumpenalty would be imprisonment for life.6. As regards endeavouring to seduce a person serving in Her Majesty&apos;s forces from his duty or allegiance, if this amounted to a mutiny or incitement to a mutinycovered by (1) above it would carry a liability to the death penalty, and if to anyother form or incitement to any other form of mutiny to imprisonment for life.In any other cases it is considered that it would be sufficient to charge the offenderwith the civil offence of &quot;maliciously and advisedly endeavouring to seduce anymember of Her Majesty&apos;s forces from his duty or allegiance,&quot; which carries a penalty of 2 years&apos; imprisonment under the Incitement to Disaffection Act, 1934, of,
for exceptional cases, life imprisonment under the Incitement to Mutiny Act, 1797.It is, therefore, not proposed to mention this offence specifically in the revise ofSection 7. The same applies to sedition, which under the ordinary criminal law doesnot carry the death penalty. Unless it amounted to mutiny or incitement to mutiny,it would be charged as a civil offence.7. The Select Committee also wish to introduce a new offence of &quot; collectiveinsubordination &quot; to cover some or all of the less serious forms of mutiny. TheService Departments are opposed to this and propose to resist it.8. I should perhaps add that the Army and Air Force Courts-martial committee, 1946 (the Lewis Committee), recommended that an attempt shouldbe made to define the offence of mutiny, which they thought in the light of present-day conditions was capable of too wide an interpretation. A definition has beenagreed, in consultation with the Law Officers, and it is proposed to place this beforethe Select Committee at the same time.  It is as follows:  &quot; &apos; Mutiny &apos; means a combination between persons subject to Service law to overthrow, resist or disobey lawful authority in any of Her Majesty&apos;s forces or in any armed forces co-operating with any of Her Majesty&apos;s forces or toimpede the performance of any duty or service in any such forces; and forthe purpose of this definition &apos; Service law&apos; means the Naval Discipline Act,military law, the Air Force Act, and any other enactment or law in force forthe government of any of Her Majesty&apos;s forces raised outside the UnitedKingdom or of any armed forces co-operating with any of Her Majesty&apos;forces.&quot;9. The Select Committee have been waiting some time for our views andare anxious to have them as soon as possible. I should therefore be glad to havethe early approval of the Cabinet to these proposals.K&quot;&apos;.&apos;    &apos; .   .      \ - &apos;    &apos; A.Ministry of Defence, S.W. 1,13th February, 1953.ANNEXSection 7, The Army ActEvery person subject to military law who commits any of the followingoffences:   that is to say,(1) Causes or conspires with any other persons to cause any mutiny orsedition in any of Her Majesty&apos;s military, naval or air forces (including any Dominion f6rce); or(2) Endeavours to seduce any person in any such force as aforesaid fromallegiance to Her Majesty, or to persuade any person in any such force as aforesaid to join in any mutiny or sedition; or(3) Joins in, or being present does not use his utmost endeavours to suppress,-any mutiny or sedition in any such forces as aforesaid; or(4) Coming to the knowledge of any actual or intended mutiny or sedition inany such force as aforesaid, does not without delay inform hiscommanding officer of the same;shall, on conviction by court-martial, be liable to suffer . death, or such lesspunishment as is in this Act mentioned.
