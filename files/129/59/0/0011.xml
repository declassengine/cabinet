Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1953CONFIDENTIALC. (53) 6116th February, 1953CABINETCORONATION OF HER MAJESTY QUEEN ELIZABETH IIPrecedence of Special Representatives from Foreign StatesMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Lord Chamberlain having requested the advice of the Foreign Office onthe question of the Order of Precedence of the foreign representatives at the coronation, an examination has been made of the Order of Precedence approvedby His late Majesty King George VI at the Coronation of 1937. This order, which followed broadly the precedent of 1911, was as follows (the paragraphs inset refer to the members of the British Royal House were were interleaved with foreignroyal personages):  (1) Princes representing countries represented in London by Ambassadors(i.e., Major Powers), such Princes being brothers of their Sovereigns.((2) Brothers, Sister, Sisters-in-Law and Brother-in-Law of The King.)(3) Heirs to Kingdoms (Minor Powers).(Note : there were no Heirs to Kingdoms (Major Powers) present. If therehad been, they would have formed Category 1, and Category 1 shown above would have become Category 3.)((4) Great Uncle and Great Aunts of The King.)(5) Non-Royal Representatives of countries ordinarily represented in london by Ambassadors, in the order of precedence of the latter.(6) Princes (not being Heirs) representing Kingdoms.((7) Cousins of The King who were Royal Highnesses.)((8) Cousins of The King who were not Royal Highnesses.)(9) Non-Royal Representatives of foreign countries not already included, inthe order of precedence of their Ministers in London..((10) Remaining Members of the Royal Family.)2. It will be seen that the order of precedence thus established was basedon the distinctions between (A) monarchical and non-monarchical States and(B) &quot; Great Powers &quot; and &quot; Minor Powers,&quot; a Great Power being in 1937, as in1911, recognised as one having an Ambassador accredited to the Court of st. James&apos;s.3. The strict application of similar principles in 1953 was found to giverise to various difficulties, because although distinction (A) remains, distinction (B)has been deprived of its significance by the regrettable rush to convert Legationsinto Embassies which has been going on in recent years. In 1937 there were16 Ambassadors in London: to-day there are 45 (including those of States suchas Liberia and the Dominican Republic).4. It might be supposed that a working basis for 1953 could have beenprovided by making a broad division of. the special representatives from foreign states into two categories, viz.: (A) those from countries having monarchicalregimes and (B) those from countries having non-monarchical regimes; by asking43747Copy No.
the former to pass first in the order of their relationship to the sovereigns theywere representing; and by arranging for the non-monarchical representatives tofollow in the order of precedence of their corresponding resident diplomatic repre-sentatives in London.5. A plan embodying these general principles would probably have beenthe most orthodox and on the whole the simplest to explain and defend. On theother hand it suffers from certain obvious disadvantages. In the first place, its adoption would involve the representatives of the United States (whose ambassador in London, owing to the recent date of his arrival, will be one of the most junior)being given a regrettably low position. Secondly, a difficulty would arise overthe position of the representatives of France, who, although relatively highly placedon account of the French Ambassadors place in London as Dean of the diplomatic corps, would nevertheless have to pass after the representative of the Royal Houseof Vietnam, not to mention those of numerous other lesser monarchical states.Thirdly, the Crown Prince of Japan would be in the forefront of the CoronationCeremonies.6. In order to avoid these difficulties, I would propose to divide the repre-sentatives of monarchical states into two groups. The first would be composedof representatives of those Royal Houses connected by blood with the BritishRoyal family. These would head the list. They would be directly followed bythe representatives of France, the United States and the Soviet Union, since theseare the only other countries besides Great Britain which are generally accepted as being Great Powers. A precedent for this can be found in the arrangementsfor 1911, when a special place was given to the representatives of France and theUnited States as Great Powers. The remaining group of representatives ofmonarchical states would pass next in the line. They would be followed in their turn by the representatives of all the non-monarchical states other than the three great Powers, in the order of precedence of their respective diplomatic representatives in London.7. I attach at Annex the draft of a precedence table showing how theseproposals would work out in practice. (No attempt has been made in this tableto place the monarchical representatives in their correct order of precedence.) Itwill be observed that the position of the German Special Representative, as deter-mined by the precedence of the Federal Government^ Diplomatic representative in London (who is only a Charge d&apos;Affaires), would be at the very end of the list.In view of the importance of the Federal Republic in world affairs, this is perhapsregrettable, but I do not see any way of avoiding it. The position of the GermanRepresentative would, of course, be somewhat improved if political developmentspermitted the appointment of a German Ambassador in London before June.8. While the Order of Precedence is of no great intrinsic importance, we must recognise that foreign representatives will scrutinise very carefully the order whichwe adopt. It may also give rise to comment in the Press. Whatever we do, weare bound to cause some heart-burning; but generally speaking I think that our decisions will be accepted without much question. At the same time, it is desirablethat we should have a system which can be easily explained and defended, and itis clear that the fact that we could appeal to precedent as justification for it indetail is a strong argument in favour of the present proposal.9. Subject to the views of my colleagues, I propose to advise the lord chamberlain that we should adopt the Order of Precedence of foreign SpecialRepresentatives outlined above.A.
