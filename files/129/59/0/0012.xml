Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1953CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 9in&quot;......- i      i m \jf A^lC. (53) 6216th February, 1953CABINETTHE CORONATION OATHMemorandum by the Lord chancellor. Historical note the question which I discuss in this paper (at some length I fear) is whetherthe form of Oath which it is proposed that The Queen shall take on the occasion of Her Coronation can lawfully be administered to Her. The legality of the Oathhas been challenged on the ground that it departs from the form of the coronation oath prescribed by the Coronation Oath Act of 1688 (1 William &amp; Mary C. 6)as amended by s. 3 of the Act of Union with Scotland (6 Anne C. 11). Thequestion so stated ignores the many alterations which between 1688 and to-dayhave without legislative sanction been made in the form of the Coronation Oath.An enquiry into the legality of the alterations now proposed appears to me to involve an examination of previous changes.2. From the earliest times of our monarchy the King was at his Coronationrequired to take an Oath, the substance of which was that he would keep inviolatethe laws and customs of England as of old. These words and even the language,sometimes Latin, sometimes Norman French, were changed from time to time,but this was the substance of the matter. It was in 1688 for the first time, so faras my researches have discovered, that the form of Oath was prescribed by act of Parliament. Important changes had been introduced upon the Coronation ofCharles I: one of them had been the ground of one of the articles of impeachmentof Archbishop Laud. It had in 1688 clearly become desirable that in the words of the preamble to the statute of that year &quot; one uniform Oath may be in all times to come taken by the Kings and Queens of this Realm.&apos;&apos; The statute accordinglyprescribed three questions :  (1) &quot; Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the people of thisKingdom of England and the dominions thereto belonging accordingto the Statutes in Parliament agreed on and the laws and customs ofthe same?(2) Will you to your power cause law and justice in mercy to be executed inall your judgments?(3) Will you to the utmost of your power maintain the laws of God, the trueprofession of the Gospel and the Protestant Reformed Religion estab-lished by law? And will you preserve unto the Bishops and clergy ofthis Realm and to the churches committed to their charge all such rightsand privileges as by law do or shall appertain unto them or any ofthem? &quot;Since then alterations have been made on five occasions to the form of Oath thusprescribed. My immediate task is to examine the circumstances in which these changes were made and what (if any) was the authority for making them.3. The first change was introduced by the Act of Union, 1706, and it willbe found that this is the only change which has been expressly authorised by statute. The reason for altering the form of Oath on the union of England and scotland was that the Treaty of Union had provided that in Scotland the religionprofessed by the people of Scotland should be preserved to them and confirmed by every King on his accession, and it was though fit that some similar provision43734 b
should be made for the protection of the English church in England. S. 3 of theAct of Union accordingly provided that every Sovereign after Queen Anne should at &quot;his or her Coronation .... take and subscribe an oath to maintain and preserve inviolably the said settlement of the Church of England and the doctrine,worship, discipline and government thereof as by law established within thekingdoms of England and Ireland the dominion of Wales and town of Berwickupon Tweed and the territories thereunto belonging.&quot;4. It should be noted that s. 3 of the Act of Union prescribed an additiononly to the third question of the Oath as laid down in the Act of 1688, i.e., to thequestion relating to religion. It did not authorise any alteration to the first two questions relating respectively to government and justice. Yet in the form ofOath employed at the Coronation of George I two alterations were made to thefirst question without statutory authority, viz., &quot; Great Britain &quot; was substitutedfor &quot; England &quot; and &quot; the respective laws &quot; was substituted for &quot; the laws.&quot; , Afurther alteration, not authorised by the Act of Union or any other statute, wasalso made to that final part of the third question which relates to the preservation of the rights and privileges of the bishops and clergy. There the word &quot; England &quot;was substituted for the words &quot; this realm &quot; prescribed by the Coronation OathAct. The Oath as administered to George I is set out below with the alterationsshown in square brackets. Their purpose was to meet the situation created bythe Act of Union. The same form was used at the Coronations of George II andGeorge III.&quot; Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the people of thiskingdom of [Great Britain], and the dominions thereunto belonging, accordingto the statutes in parliament agreed on, and the [respective] laws and customsof the same?Will you, to your power, cause law and justice, in mercy, to be executedin all your judgments?Will you to the utmost of your power maintain the laws of God, the true profession of the Gospel, and the protestant reformed religion establishedby law? [And will you maintain and preserve inviolably the settlement of thechurch of England, and the doctrine, worship, discipline, and governmentthereof as by law established, within the kingdoms of England and Ireland,the dominion of Wales, and town of Berwick upon Tweed, and the territoriesthereunto belonging, before the union of the two kingdoms?] And will youpreserve unto the bishops and clergy of [England], and to the churches therecommitted to their charge, all such rights and privileges as by law do or shallappertain unto them or any of them?&quot;5. The second alteration was made at the Coronation of George IV andfollowed upon the Act of Union with Ireland, Article 1 of which provided thatthe &quot; Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland shall .... be united into onekingdom by the name of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.&quot;Article 5 provided that the churches of England and Ireland should be united.There was no express authority in. the Act of Union with Ireland for the changesin the Coronation Oath made at the Coronation of George IV, which were:  (a) In the first question the words &quot; Kingdom of Great Britain &quot; were alteredto &quot; United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.&quot;(b) In the third question, several alterations were made to take account of theunion of the churches. This question read as follows; the altered words being shown in square brackets:  &quot; Will you, to the uttermost of your power, maintain the laws of God, the true profession of the Gospel, and the protestant reformed religion establishedby law? And will you maintain and preserve inviolably the settlement of- the[United Church of England and Ireland], and the doctrine, worship, discipline,and government thereof, as by law established, within England and Ireland,and the territories thereunto belonging? And will you preserve unto the bishops and clergy of England [and Ireland], and to the [United Church]committed to their charge, all such rights and privileges as by law do, or shallappertain to them, or any of them?&quot;(c) The Oath taken by George I (see paragraph 4 above) in that part of thethird question which relates to the maintenance of the settlement of the Church en-England followed exactly the form prescribed by the Act of Union except that the
words &quot; before the Union of the two kingdoms &quot; were added after the words &quot; terri-tories thereunto belonging.&quot; At the Coronation of George IV, and ever since, these additional words have been dropped. Probably they represented the intention ofthe legislature at the time of the Act of Union but appeared to be inappropriateafter the acquisition by the United Kingdom of further territories in the course ofthe eighteenth century. There was no express statutory authority either for puttingthem in or for taking them out.(d) A further alteration was made at the Coronation of George IV to that partof the Oath expressly prescribed by the Act of Union, where the words &quot; dominion of Wales and Town of Berwick upon Tweed &quot; were omitted; and they have been omitted at all Coronations since then. The use of these words was perhaps thought to have become unnecessary in view of Statute 20 George II C. 42 which providedthat wherever England was mentioned in any Act of Parliament it should be deemedto include Wales and Berwick upon Tweed.6. The third alteration was made at the Coronation of William IV. In thelast part of the third question for the words &quot; to the united church committed totheir charge &quot; were substituted the words &quot; to the churches there committed to theircharge,&quot; thus reverting to the form prescribed in the Act of 1688. The Oathadministered to Queen Victoria was the same as to King William IV.7. The fourth alteration was made in 1902 at the Coronation of Edward VIIand followed upon the Irish Church Disestablishment Act, 1869. The thirdquestion read as follows, the altered words being shown in square brackets:&quot; Will you to the utmost of your power maintain the laws of God, the trueprofession of the Gospel, and the protestant reformed religion established bylaw? And will you maintain and preserve inviolably the settlement of [theChurch of England], and the doctrine, worship, discipline, and governmentthereof, as by law established in [England]? And will you preserve untothe bishops and clergy of [England], and to the [Church therein] committed to their charge, all such rights and privileges, as by law do or shall appertainto them, or any of them?&quot;It might be argued that in this case there was express statutory authority for the alteration, since s. 69 of the Act provided that &quot; in all enactments, deeds and documents in which mention is made of the United Churches of England andIreland the enactments and provisions relating thereto shall be read distributivelyin respect of the Church of England and the Church of Ireland, but as. to the lastmentioned Church subject to the provisions of this Act.&quot; In fact Lord Halsbury,L.C., in answer to a question in the House of Lords stated that legislation would notbe required for that reason. Nevertheless, that section could not be held to beauthority for the omission of the words &quot; and the territories thereunto belonging &quot;in that part of the third question relating to the maintenance of the settlement ofthe church which was prescribed by the Act of Union, and which had been includedin the Oath at all Coronations since. The Church of England was not established in any of the territories but there was no statutory authority for recognising this fact in the Coronation Oath.8. The fifth alteration took place at the Coronation of George VI in 1937,and was required by the change in the constitutional position of the UnitedKingdom in relation to the Dominions which had been made by the Statute of westminster. (The form of Oath used at the Coronation of George V followedexactly that used at the Coronation of Edward VII except that in the last part ofthe third question instead of employing the words &quot; the Church therein committed to their charge &quot; it reverted to the form prescribed in the Act of 1688, he,, &quot; the churches there committed to their charge.&quot;)9. I set out in the annex to this paper in parallel columns the Oath as adminis-tered in 1911 and 1937. It will be seen that the following alterations were made:  First Question(a) To reflect the new status of the Dominions as recognised in the statute of Westminster, each of the Dominions was separately mentioned, for it would havebeen clearly inconsistent with the Statute to describe them as &quot; dominionsbelonging &quot; to Great Britain.(b) S. 4 of the Statute of Westminster provided that no Act of Parliament ofthe United Kingdom should in future extend to a Dominion except with its43734 b&apos;2
consent. This made the promise to govern &quot; according to the statutes in parliamentagreed on &quot; meaningless, and it was accordingly omitted and the phrase &quot; accordingto their respective laws and customs &quot; substituted. &quot; Laws and customs &quot; of courseinclude statute law.Second Question.  No alteration.Third question in none of the Dominions was the protestant reformed religion established bylaw, hence the general promise to maintain it was inappropriate. The first partof the question was therefore split into two: a general promise to maintain the laws of God and the true profession of the Gospel, and a promise to maintain onlyin the United Kingdom the protestant reformed religion.II. Alterations now proposed10. These alterations are all to the first question and they are directed to meetthe constitutional changes brought about by the Indian Independence Act, 1947.setting up the independent Dominions of India and Pakistan (and later legislationrecognising the creation of a republic in India), the Cevlon Independence Act, 1947,and the Republic of Ireland Act, 1949. The alterations are to omit references toIreland and India, to substitute the words &quot; Great Britain &quot; and the words &quot; theUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland &quot; and to add references to Pakistan and Ceylon.   The question will now read as follows:  &quot; Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the peoples of theUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Canada, Australia,New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, Pakistan and Ceylon, and of yourpossessions and the other territories to any of them belonging or pertaining,according to their respective laws and customs? &quot;The reasons why legislation is not necessary to effect these changes is that thevarious enactments which have brought about the alteration in the status of thecountries affected are inconsistent with the Coronation Oath Act, 1688, as lateramended. I deal with the legal questions involved at greater length in Section IIIbelow.III. Legal Position11. There is a well-known and firmly-established principle of law (of whichthe authors of recent newspaper articles seem to be unaware) that, when theprovisions of a later enactment are so inconsistent with or repugnant to the pro-visions of an earlier one that the two cannot stand together, the later enactment,so far as necessary, repeals the earlier. This appears to be plain common sense.For it is not possible that there should be two Acts of Parliament, both of themalive and effective, of which one commands &quot; Do this &quot; and the other commands&quot; Do the opposite,&quot; or of which one says that a certain course is legal and the othersays the same course is illegal. In such a conflict the Legislature is credited withhaving by the later Act impliedly-repealed the former. I cannot say how far inthe past this principle has been consciously invoked when changes in the Oath havebeen made without statutory authority. But at least in 1937 when the changesconsequent upon the Statute of Westminster were made, the Lord Chancellor(Lord Hailsham) and the Law Officers gave it as their considered opinion that&quot; since the form of the Coronation Oath is laid down by Statute it cannot be altered without statutory authority. But it has always been recognised that if a statute is passed altering the constitutional position of this country in such a way as to render the words of-the original Oath no longer applicable, that Act may betreated as impliedly authorising, and indeed requiring, a corresponding alteration in the wording of the Oath.&quot; This is an application of the principle to theparticular case with which I have in an earlier paper expressed my concurrence.I expound it thus.12. S. 4 of the Statute of Westminster provides that no Act of Parliamentof the United Kingdom passed after the commencement of the Statute shall extend to a Dominion as part of its law, except with its consent. The coronation oath, however, as administered at the previous Coronation, required the king to swear to govern the peoples of the Dominions &quot; according to the Statutes mParliament agreed on.&quot; To make him swear this in 1937 was to make him swearan Oath which the Statute of Westminster denied him the power to observe. Hence
arose a repugnancy between the two statutes which the law resolves by deemingthe later statute to have repealed the earlier so far as is necessary to remove therepugnancy. The same argument can be used about all the amendments of substance that have at various times been made without statutory authority inorder to bring the Coronation Oath into conformity with a change in theconstitution. I conclude that the challenge to the legality of the changes madein 1937 or of those now proposed to be made is ill-founded. I rely on the line ofhistorical precedents to which I have referred and the legal principle underlyingthem, and I am fortified not only by the opinion of an earlier Lord chancellor and Law Officers but also by that of Sir John Simon (then Home Secretary), whoconcurred in the view that legislative authority was not needed for the changesthen made. It would be wrong to suppose (as has been suggested) that the matter was not very carefully examined in 1937.13. It has been suggested that a different and better precedent is supplied by the change that was made in the Accession Declaration by the Act of 1911. Ido not think so. The reason for that change was not that any enactment hadbeen made which conflicted with the Act of Settlement, or that any constitutionalor territorial change had taken place. The reason for the change was that theterms of the Declaration were thought to be offensive and outmoded. Consequentlyexpress legislation was necessary to alter them.IV. Constitutional Position14. I have so far dealt only with the question whether the proposed changesin the Oath are illegal unless they have legislative sanction. The question may still be asked whether, even if they can be legally made in this way, it is properfor such high matters to. be disposed of except with the authority of Parliament.15. I suggest that it would be very unwise for the Parliament of the UnitedKingdom to attempt to legislate on this matter. The position is one of greatconstitutional delicacy. At Westminster and only at Westminster The Queen willbe crowned. There she will be crowned Queen of Canada and of the other self-governing members of the Commonwealth in just the same sense as she will becrowned Queen of the United Kingdom. The Oath which she will take at.herCoronation is as much the concern of the people, the Government and the Parlia-ment of Canada as it is of those of the United Kingdom. If it is said that this isnot a matter in which the Government of the United Kingdom can act without consulting Parliament, so by parity of reasoning legislative authority may be thought to be required in each country of the Commonwealth. The Government of (say)Canada may not assume to act on its ov/n authority if the Government of theUnited Kingdom has not thought it right to do so. Thus it may become necessaryfor each member State of the Commonwealth to pass legislation sanctioning theform of Coronation Oath. I think that the Commonwealth Secretary can showfrom his records of 1937 how difficult and delicate, if not impossible, this task would be.16. The position, as I now understand it, is that the proposed new form ofOath has been put to all the Commonwealth Governments and that none of them has dissented.   And there I would leave it.17. It is I think unfortunate that doubts about the legality of the course thatI propose should be publicly expressed, but, as they have been, it may be worth considering whether some statement should be made in either House. I wouldmyself be against this course if it can be avoided, but perhaps it cannot be avoided.18. Finally I have been asked whether, if it is decided to introduce legislationprescribing the altered form of Oath, this could be done by an appropriate clause inthe proposed Royal Style and Titles Bill. I do not think that there would be any difficulty about this, though the subject matter is different. The clause would, I suppose, provide that the Oath to be taken by the King and Queen at futureCoronations should be in the terms now proposed which could be either in theclause itself or in a Schedule.SIMONDS.Lord Chancellors Department, S.W. 1,16th February, 1953.
