CORPORAL punishment memorandum by the Home Secretary andthe Secretary of State for Scotland.The Cabinet last considered the question of corporal punishmentas a judicial penalty at its meeting on 20th November, 1952 (C.C.(52) 99thConclusions, Minute 8).   A copy of a Private Member&apos;s Bill to enable corporal punishment to be imposed by superior courts on conviction of feloniesinvolving personal violence is attached (Appendix I):  the Second Reading ofthis Bill is to be on 13th February.2. The first question is whether there should be a free vote on this occasion.   It was provisionally agreed at the Cabinet meeting on 20th November,1952 that there should be a free vote and no doubt our colleagues will reaffirmthat decision.If the Cabinet decide that advice should be given to the House bythe Government spokesman, it would seem that Members of the Governmentshould be required not to vote contrary to that advice.ICOPY NO.    ^3. The second question is what line the Government spokesman shouldtake in the debate.   It would be possible for him -(a) to declare that the Government is opposed in principle tocorporal punishment as a judicial penalty;(b) to explain that there are serious defects in the Bill;  and(c) to point out that there has not been sufficient time to judge the effect of the Criminal Justice Act, 1948 as a whole, and thatthe provision abolishing corporal punishment as a judicialpenalty should not be considered in isolation from other provisions of that Act which introduced new forms of punishment,particularly for young offenders and persistent offenders.   he might also refer to the Governments Bill to make illegalthe carrying of offensive weapons in public places without lawfulexcuse.4. We suggest that the Government spokesman should deal with the matter on the lines of (b) and (c), without going as far as (a).5. Among the defects of the Bill there is the technical difficulty of applyingits provisions to Scotland, and the serious risk of differentiation between Englandand Scotland.6. We give, in Appendix II, (i) a note on some developments since theCabinet last discussed the matter arid (ii) a fuller statement about Mr. Bullus&apos; BillD.M.F.6th February, 1953.

APPENDIX II1.    Developments since the matter was last discussed by the Cabinet(a)        Consideration has been given to introducing a Bill making it an offence to carry an offensive weapon in a public place without lawful excuse, astep which shows that the Government is prepared to take positive steps todeal with crimes of violence.(b) The English Advisory Council on the Treatment of Offenders has submitted a unanimous recommendation against the restoration of corporal punishment as a judicial penalty.   The Council has suggested that it is preferable to examine the possibility of introducing the sanction of making criminals paymonetary compensation to the victims of their crimes;  this suggestion raisesmany practical difficulties, but it has its attractions and the possibility of setting up a departmental committee to go into it, so far as England andWales are concerned, is being considered.(c) The result of a Gallup Poll published in the News Chronicle before christmas showed that of the members of the public questioned by the Pollsome 66 per cent favoured corporal punishment.   It is fair to say, however,that the correspondence and comments which have appeared in the press since then and the letters which have been received in the Home Office show some increase in the strength of the opposition to corporal punishment.(d) The figures for offences of robbery with violence known to thepolice in England and Wales during 1952 show some increase over those for1951, although they are less than the figures for 1950.   The figures for thepast five years are as follows:-Larceny Act, 1916	Section	Section	Total	*   23(1)	23 (2) and (3)	1948	978	123	1,1011949	860	130	9901950	..   812	209	1,0211951	633	167	8001952 (pro-	766	237	1,003visional)^(Offences under this subsection were punishable withcorporal punishment before September 1948),In Scotland, where the Liarceny Acts do not apply the figures for robberiesand assaults with intent to rob are:-1948 3531949 3251950 3461951 3051952 (pro- 301visional)v3
(a)   The Bill as drafted seems to be quite unsuitable to achieve its purpose,and could not, we think, be put right by amendments at the Committee State.   It is obviously attractive for the draftsman of such a Bill to use some generalphrase about crimes of violence, but the reference to a felony involving the useof any personal violence to any person involves so many obscurities and anomaliesthat in practice it would not work.   In England and Wales crimes are notdivided into felonies and misdemeanours on any logical basis;  and it would not always be clear whether a particular felony involved personal violence or not.It is even doubtful whether the phrase would apply to all the offences ofrobbery with violence under Section 23(1) of the Larceny Act, 1916 which were previously punishable with flogging; a robber who holds up an individual with agun and puts him in fear commits an offence under that Section, and before 1948could have been flogged, but it is doubtful if he could be flogged under theprovisions of this new Bill.   The Bill would enable the courts to imposecorporal punishment on persons convicted of murder, attempted murder andmanslaughter (for which such a punishment does not seem very appropriate), rape,and most, but not all, of the offences normally covered under the term &quot;feloniouswounding&quot;.   But it would not cover assault, including indecent assault, crueltyto children, or any of the misdemeanours normally grouped under the heading&quot;malicious wounding&quot;.   It would not cover such offences as procuration, livingon immoral earnings and blackmail.Amendments would be needed to make it clear whether or not theBill applies to Scotland.   If the Bill were applicable to Scotland, it is doubtful, as itis at present drafted, what its effect would be.   The Interpretation Act, 1889,translated &quot;felony&quot; into &quot;a high crime and offence&quot; for Scotland; but this - if it means anything now - probably means any crime or offence which is in practiceprosecuted on indictment.   Thus the Bill would apparently introduce whipping asa penalty for a number of offences for which it could not be imposed in England -for example, assault and cruelty to children.   It would involve in Scotlandreverting to a form of penalty abolished ninety years ago for crimes of violence;and incidentially would not revive it for the only significant offence for which it remained available until 1948, i. e. a second conviction of living on the immoralearnings of a woman,(b) Our own view is that it would not be possible to carry out theintention of the movers of this Bill by any general provision on the lines whichthey propose, but that it would be necessary to list the specific offences for whichcorporal punishment could be awarded.   Such a procedure opens a prospect ofendless debate:  different offences at different times arouse public indignationand there are vocal sections of the public who think that cruelty to children andcruelty to animals are even more deserving of a retributive punishment thanrobbery with violence.   It would also give rise to serious difficulties in equatingScottish to English offences.(c) There are a good many other points arising on the Bill which wouldrequire consideration, although many of these could if necessary be met byamendments.   For instance - should there be any limit on the number of strokesof the birch?  Should there be any limitation of age?   Should the courts be precluded from combining corporal punishment with probation or with sentences such asBorstal or corrective training which are intended to be primarily of a reformativecharacter?   Should the operation of the Bill be restricted to an experimental period?  Should the courts have power to impose corporal punishment onafirst conviction for one of the relevant offences, or only on a second or subsequentconviction?
