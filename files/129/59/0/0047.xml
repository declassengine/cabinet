CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.C. (53) 9711th March, 195372CABINETHISTORIC BUILDINGS bill memorandum by the Lord ChancellorIntroductionThe Cabinet at their meeting on 5th February &quot;took note that the PrimeMinister would appoint a Cabinet Committee to re-examine the policy underlying the proposed Bill for the preservation of historic houses and to report on this tothe Cabinet&quot; (C.C. (53) 7th Conclusions, Minute 2). As Chairman of theCommittee appointed, I report on their behalf accordingly. My colleagues on theCommittee were the Minister of Housing and Local Government, the Minister ofNational Insurance, the Minister of Works and the Financial Secretary, Treasury.The Gowers Plan2. It has been generally assumed that the policy underlying the draftHistoric Buildings Bill is to carry out the main recommendation of the Gower&apos;s committee on Houses of Outstanding Historic or Architectural Interest, which wasappointed by the late Government and reported in March 1950. It is, therefore,necessary to be clear as to what that Committee recommended.3. Briefly, the Gowers Committee recommended that houses of outstandinghistoric or architectural interest should be &quot; designated &quot; by Historic BuildingsCouncils, to be appointed for England and Wales and for Scotland, and that thehouses so &quot; designated &quot; should be eligible for certain financial assistance. In orderthat these houses should, so far as possible, be preserved in private occupation,,preferably by. the families connected with them, the Committee recommended that financial assistance should take the form primarily of certain reliefs from incometax, surtax and death duties in favour of their owner-occupiers, although they proposed that the Historic Buildings Councils should also have powers of aidingthe preservation of designated houses, in appropriate cases, by the making of loans and grants. The Committee&apos;s tentative estimate of the number of houses whichwould qualify for &quot; designation &quot; was 2,000.Draft Historic Buildings bill. The question whether any and what measures should be taken to preservehistoric houses in accordance with the Gowers Committee&apos;s recommendations wasconsidered both by the Home Affairs Committee (H.A. (52) 26th and 27th Meetings)and by the Cabinet, who approved (C.C. (52) 87th Conclusions, Minute 6) the drafting of a Bill providing for assistance by means of grants. Accordingly,Clause 3(1) of the draft Historic Buildings Bill empowers the Minister to:  &quot; make grants for the purpose of defraying in whole or in part any expenditure incurred or to be incurred in the repair or maintenance of a building appearing to the Minister to be of special architectural or historic interest, or in theupkeep of any land held with any such building and forming part of the amenities thereof, or in the repair or maintenance of any objects ordinarily kept in any such building.&quot;43872Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1953
Clause 4(1) of the draft Bill, which was also relevant to the problem facing theCommittee, empowers the Minister to:  &quot; acquire by agreement, whether by purchase lease or otherwise, or to accepta gift or devise of, any building appearing to him to be one of specialarchitectural or historic interest, with or without any land comprising orcontiguous or adjacent to the building.&quot;On 5th February, however, the Cabinet accepted a suggestion by the Lord president that the proposed basis for assistance in the preservation of historic houses shouldbe reconsidered.Policy Underlying the Draft Historic Buildings Bill5. The sum of money which the Chancellor of the Exchequer can at presentsee his way to make available annually for this purpose is some  250,000 to 300,000. This sum is clearly quite inadequate for the carrying out of the Gower&apos;s committee&apos;s main recommendation in respect of any substantial proportion of thehouses which that Committee considered likely to be found worthy of designation.It is, therefore, necessary to recognise that the draft Historic Buildings Bill is not,in fact, designed to carry out the main recommendation of the Gowers committee as described above. Moreover, if the power of acquisition to be conferred by clause 4 of the Bill is to be exercised and the Chancellor of the Exchequer has agreed to make available for this purpose from the Land Fund a sum of  500,000spread over five years houses so acquired should clearly have first call on thesum available annually for preservation. Apart from this, the houses most urgentlyin need of assistance are, to a large extent, not those whose private owners seem likely in any case to remain in occupation for some time to come. Some arealready unoccupied; others have been taken over by public bodies of one kind or another; and others are on the point of coming into the market with little prospectof finding a new private owner. For all such cases grants could usefully be madebut tax reliefs would be inappropriate. Any balance of the annual sum remainingafter these cases have been provided for, will, if the Bill is enacted in its present,form, be available for distribution in the form of grants to those owner-occupierswho are in the greatest need. It is thought that this might as a rule be convenientlydone through the agency of the National Trust. The balance will, however, not be substantial, at any rate for some years, as it is invariably found that, when housescome to be assisted, there are costly arrears of repairs to be made up. It shouldbe emphasised that assistance by way of grant would be strictly confined to build-ings representative of our domestic architecture at its very best; the number of suchbuildings which can be assisted annually with the sum likely to be available istentatively put at about 50.The Principle of Tax Remission6. If the Committee had felt justified in recommending that the policy under-lying a Historic Buildings Bill should be the policy recommended by the Gower&apos;s committee, they would almost certainly have failed to agree as to the means bywhich that policy should be carried out. Thus, the objections of principle which:some members of the Committee saw to special tax reliefs in favour of the owner-dccupiers of &quot; designated &quot; houses were felt by other members of the Committeeto be no less applicable to a system of grants to the same persons. A more power-ful argument against tax reliefs was the belief that they would be opposed notonly by the whole Socialist Opposition but also by a number of government supporters with whom some members of the Committee would find themselves in sympathy. It would, moreover, be particularly difficult to justify such reliefs at atime when the Government might find it necessary to raise the general level of rents.7. One of the forms of tax relief recommended by the Gowers Committee,however, appeared to the Committee to merit serious consideration, namely theproposed exemption of a strictly limited number of outstanding houses from EstateDuty. Such an exemption would not, of course, make any contribution towardsthe immediate &quot; rescue operation &quot; in respect of houses in extremis, but it might help in encouraging owners to remain in occupation. It would, moreover, involve no more than an extension to such houses of the exemption from Estate Duty alreadyaccorded by Section 40 of the Finance Act, 1930, to &quot; objects of national, scientific,historic or artistic interest.&quot; It would, in fact, amount to a suspension rather thana remission of tax as tax would become payable in the event of the sale of the house.
conclusions. In paragraph 9 below I invite the Cabinet to endorse the Committee&apos;conclusions. They will, I fear, disappoint the hopes of many who looked forward to -a measure of comprehensive relief for the owners of historic houses. But the starkfact is that, unless a far larger sum can be made available for their relief than theChancellor of the Exchequer has so far agreed to or than the tax-payer would belikely to endure, the Gowers recommendations must be regarded as quite unrealistic.It is better to recognise that the way of life for which these houses have stood isdoomed. Some owners, particularly the older ones, will doubtless continueheroically to resist the process of social evolution; but the burden of taxation and,no less, the difficulties of obtaining domestic staff have undermined their wholebasis. All that the Government can hope to do is to preserve a small number ofsuch houses as symbols of a former civilisation. The proposed Bill is in a form which should enable this object at least to be attained, and it is an advantage thatthe terms of Clause 3(1) are so wide that, if more money should become available,it will undoubtedly be possible to put it to good use.9.   I invite the Cabinet to agree:  (1) that the Gowers Committee&apos;s plan of assistance by way of tax reliefs tothe owner-occupiers of up to 2,000 houses of outstanding historic orarchitectural interest is neither financially nor politically practicable;(2) that immediate Government assistance in the preservation of such buildingsshould take the form of ad hoc Exchequer grants on the basis providedfor in the draft Historic Buildings Bill under submission to the Legisla-tion Committee (L.C. (53) 3);(3) that consideration should be given at an appropriate time to the possibilityof extending to a strictly limited number of such buildings in privateoccupation the exemption from Estate Duty accorded by Section 40 ofthe Finance Act, 1930 to &quot; objects of national, scientific, historic orartistic interest.&quot;SIMONDS.House of Lords, S.W.1,11th March, 1953.
