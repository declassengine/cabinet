secret.(53) 58   . COPY NO.   \3 I11TH FEBRUARY,   1953CABINETENQUIRY INTO THE COST OF THE national health service memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer at their meeting on 3rd February (C. C. (53) 6th Conclusions, Item 7),the Cabinet agreed that a committee should be appointed to review the cost ofthe National Health Service on the general lines suggested in C. (53) 30.    Atthe same time they invited me, after consultation with the Health Ministers,to submit for the Cabinefs approval the proposed membership of the committeeand the revised terms of reference for it.2.      The revised terms of reference which I suggest are as follows:-&quot;To review the present and prospective costof the National Health Service;  to suggest means,whether by modifications in organisation or other-wise, of ensuring the most effective control and efficient use of such Exchequer funds as may beavailable;  to advise how a rising Exchequer chargecan be avoided, while providing for the maintenanceof the service and its reasonable development;  andto make recommendations. &quot;3.     As regards the composition of the committee, I propose that we should ask Sir Hector Hetherington, the Vice-Chancellor of Glasgow University, totake the Chair.    We must be careful to avoid members representative of theindividual services provided by the National Health Service because this wouldmean having a general practitioner, .a consultant, a dentist and so forth whichwould overload the committee and not give us the kind of advice which we want.I suggest that we should have a scientist who would be recognised by the medical profession as someone who speaks their language, a business man, a retiredCivil Servant who could guide the committee through the practical side ofgovernment finance, a woman and a Trade Unionist - we must ask the TradesUnion Congress to suggest a name.If this general line is approved, I hope the Cabinet will agreethat Sir Hector Hetherington should be approached and that we may settle the membership of the committee round the Chairman on the general patternoutlined above.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.11th February, 1953.
