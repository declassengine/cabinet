Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1953SECRETCopy No.      63C. (S3) 539th February, 1953CABINETARMS FOR wales memorandum by the Secretary of State Home Department and Ministerfor Welsh affairs in 1901, 1910, 1935 and again last year representations were made for theinclusion of Wales in the Royal Arms. In 1901 an additional Badge, representa-tive of the Principality of Wales, was added to the achievement of the Prince of wales; in 1910 the Prince of Wales&apos;s Arms were altered by the substitution of ashield, carrying the Arms of Llewellyn, for the Arms of Saxony. In 1935 my predecessor was unable to advise The King to accede to the application.2. The Cymmrodorion Society made representations to me last year for somerecognition of Wales in the Royal Arms by altering them to include a devicerepresentative of Wales.3. The Committee of the Privy Council which considered similar representa-tions in 1910 reported against any alteration of the Royal Arms, on the grounds (i) that the Royal Arms are Arms of Dominion, their sole function being torepresent the Sovereign^ style;(ii) that legislation would have been necessary to authorise such a change.4, In my memorandum to the Home Affairs Committee (H.A. (52) 96) Idrew attention to the further objection that, if Wales were to be represented in theRoyal Arms, Commonwealth countries might claim that they also should berepresented.5. The Home Affairs Committee on 8th July (HA. (52) 19th Meeting, Item 1)agreed that the decision of 1910 that Wales could not be represented in the RoyalArms of the United Kingdom must stand, but further agreed that, subject toinformal soundings, The Queen should.be advised to appoint a Committee of the privy Council, consisting of the Lord President, the Home Secretary and the earl Marshal,&quot; to consider how best to satisfy the desire of the people of Wales for recognition of Wales in the heraldic field short of an alteration of the arms of the United Kingdom.&quot;6. Her Majesty informally approved the setting up of a Committee of the privy Council for this purpose, and the Lord Privy Seal (owing to the illness of theLord President), the Earl Marshal and I have met and considered in what way someheraldic distinction might be conferred on Wales.7. We originally considered the suggestion that The Queen might assign toherself Arms for Wales based on the lions of Llewellyn which appear in the Prince of wales&apos;s achievement, but we came to the conclusion that the more popular heraldicdevice in Wales was the red dragon, which has been the Royal Badge for WalessinceT 801, when it was established by the Proclamation under article 1 of the act of Union of .1800.43695
8. We felt that the best way of meeting the representations was to embellishthe existing Royal Badge for Wales by enclosing it in a scroll surmounted by a royal Crown.    &apos; .9. I will circulate to the Cabinet when we meet photographic copies, in blackand white, of the design on which the Committee have agreed. The motto derives from a Welsh poem of the fifteenth century which is well known in Wales and canbe translated &quot; The red dragon takes the lead.&quot;10. Before The Queen&apos;s pleasure is taken informally on the device, I shouldbe glad to know what my colleagues think of this augmentation of a Royal badgewhich has been in existence for over 150 years, which would be used on letterpaper of Government Departments in Wales and on Government publicationsrelating to Wales and could be used on flags and on Coronation souvenirs byWelsh people throughout the Principality. When used as a flag, the whole devicemight be reproduced or only the shield containing the dragon. I think it wouldgive great pleasure to Wales if its use were authorised on the flags of Welshregiments next the flagstaff.D. M. F.Home Office, S.W.1,9th February, 1953.
