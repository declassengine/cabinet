UNITED KINGDOM ASSOCIATION WITH THEEUROPEAN DEFENCE OOMTNITYMemorandum by the Secretary- of State forForeign AffairsThe six European Defence Community (E. D.C. ) countries are at last getting down to the business of ratifying the Treatiessigned last May.     Mr. Dulles made it plain during his recent visit to Europe that the United. States expected the future prospects for the E.D.C. to be much clearer before the north atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A. T. 0, ) Council meets in April,2. German constitutional difficulties have not yet been&quot;solved, but the main doubtful factor is still the French attitude^.The policy of the new French Government is to secure French rati-fication within the next few months.     They face^ however, a verydifficult Parliamentary situation in which the Gaullists on theright and the Socialists with some Radicals on the left centre,are for different reasons strongly opposed to the E.D.C. Treaties,as they stand at present.     The support of at least one group orthe other is needed.     There is no majority available for anyother solution, e. g. German entry into the N. A. T. 0.     The FrenchGovernment have tabled the Treaties in the Assembly.     They havealso put before their E.D.C.  colleagues certain protocols whichin effect amend the Treaties to preserve the unity of the french army and give France much greater freedom within the Community.This would help to meet Gaullist objections.     We are not directly concerned with these protocols;   but they will be very difficult for the other E.D.C. countries, and more especially Germany, toswallow, since they involve discrimination in favour of France,The other French objective is to secure even closer United Kingdomassociation with the E.D. C.-, although the French Governmentrealises how much we have already done.     The Socialists andRadicals and French public opinion generally attach special importance to our position.French Proposals3m        . During the visit of the French Ministers to London on12th and 13th February, m. Bid&amp;ult handed me a Memorandum, atranslation of which is at Annex A, containing the FrenchGovernment&apos;s suggestions for further measures of association between the United Kingdom and the E.D.C.     M. Bidault wasinsistent that these were not formal proposals which we areexpected to accept or reject.     They were intended to provide abasis for further discussion through diplomatic channels.     ThisMemorandum was supplemented on 20th February&apos; by a more formaldocument, a translation of which is at Annex B,The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No..... *fc.21ST FEBRUARY, 1953CABINET
4, The French proposals contain two important new-suggestions :-(a) the United Kingdom should give an undertaking to maintain British forces on the Continentat their present strength, subject to anescape clause that in the event of a seriouscrisis overseas leading to a withdrawal ofBritish forces, consultation would takeplace to see how the level of SACEURfsforces in Europe could be re-established;(b) in return for this undertaking, the UnitedKingdom would enjoy within the institutions of the E.D.C. certain political rights,i,e, the participation, when questions ofUnited Kingdom/E.D.C, co-operation werebeing discussed, of:-(i) a British Minister in meetingsof the Council of Ministers ofthe E.D*C. ,(ii)   British Parliamentary observersat sessions of the E,D,C. Assemblywith the right to speak but not to vote, and(iii)    a British representative on theBoard of Commissioners of theE. D. C.Objections to the French proposals, The first objection to these French suggestions is theproposed link between our &quot;political rights&quot; and the newproposed United Kingdom undertaking.     It is the French whoinsisted upon an E.D.C, solution instead of German membership of the N. A. T. 0.  and it is they who are particularly insistentupon close British association with the institutions of theE. D.G, in order that by our presence we may provide a counter-weight to German influence.      It is absurd therefore that theyshould now expect us to pay a price for what is really a concession on our part.     Moreover, while we want close association with the institutions of the E.D. C, &quot;participation&quot;even for limited purposes might soon become indistinguishablefrom membership and we might find ourselves committed further than we want to go,6, Even less acceptable is the suggested undertaking tomaintain indefinitely British forces on the Continent at theirpresent strength.     This is open to the political, military andeconomic objections mentioned in the paper I circulated inDecember of last year (C (52) k3k)*      In the Tripartite Declara-tion of May, 1952, we expressed our resolve to station such forces on the Continent of Europe as we deemed necessary and appropriate to the joint defence of the North Atlantic Treatyarea, having regard, among other things, to our interest in the integrity of the E.D.C,     Under existing N.A.T. 0. procedure we accept in the Annual Review a firm commitment to maintain forcesat a stated level for one year ahead and a less firm commitment for two years beyond that.       Further than this we cannot go.It is true that the French formula purports to reproduce theterms on which British forces are at present allotted to SACEURS
ftbut its effect is very different when applied to an indefinite commitment no longer subject to annual review,Furthermore, although the present French Government mightargue that the escape clause on consultation in fact makesour commitment to maintain forces at their present level avery light one, this is not the light in which the arrange-ment could possibly be presented to the French or to our own public.     There would be great indignation whenever weinvoked the clause and we should be accused of having ineffect defaulted on an obligation.     Her Majesty&apos;s government cannot, therefore, consider such an undertaking.United Kingdom Counter-proposals* My conclusion is thus that we cannot accept theFrench suggestions in their present form.     I doubt very muchwhether the French ever really expected us to do so and Ithink they should be satisfied if we return a constructivereply indicating the lengths we are prepared to go to markour association v/ith the E.D.C.     There are four and possiblyfive ways in which we can help the French:-(a) Our proposals for military associationset out in the paper which we have alreadytabled at the E.D.C. Interim Committee inParis (text at Annex c).(b) Proposals for political association;   inparticular, (i) the appointment of a united Kingdom Mission to handle allday-to-day problems, and (ii) theappointment of a British Ministerialrepresentative to consult with theE.D.C. Council of Ministers on questionsof policy.      (i) could be developed,as in the case of the Coal and steel community at Luxemburg, into a systemof joint committees.     We should not take up the French proposal for parliamentary observers as this wouldnot be very practical and it has in anycase been rejected by the Coal and steel community.     Joint annual meetings ofthe Council of Europe and of the E.D.O.Assemblies would be preferable and arenow proposed for the Coal and steel community.(c) We can offer to reaffirm our existing commitments to the E.D.C. in a newpublic declaration which could alsodescribe the steps agreed to provideUnited Kingdom association with the E. D.C.(d) We can offer to join the French in pursuingwith the United States Government thepossibility of extending the duration ofthe North Atlantic Treaty from 20 to50 years, a step which, quite apart fromits reassuring effect on EuropeanContinental opinion, y/ould be greatly in our own interest.      It is true thatM. Bidault showed no interest in this idea.But his intention was probably to
concentrate upon the maintenance ofUnited Kingdom troops on the Continent&quot; and there is good reason to suppose thatsome such proposal would be popular in france (see, for example, Paris telegramNo. 67).8. I should prefer to stop at this.      Mr, Dulles saidto me in London recently - after his visit to Paris - that hethought that the steps described in para, 7 (a), (b) and (c)above should be enough,     I mentioned the idea in para, 7 (d)to him.     His reaction was non-committal.     There might wellbe difficulties in Washington, but Mr, Dulles did not rule outthe idea,     I therefore think it worth pursuing,9, A fifth possibility would be to use the machineryunder para. 7 (b) above for specific consultations, to whichthe French seem to attach importance, with the E,D.C.  (possibly with the addition of SACEUR) over the level of United Kingdomand E.D.C, forces to be maintained on the Continent at any given time.     This virould really only duplicate existing N.A.T.O,consultation arrangements,     I do not, however, like additionalvague and unnecessary commitments and I do not therefore propose to make such an offer.10, The above proposals fall within the plans discussed in C,(52) k3k and will therefore I hope meet with the approvalof my colleagues,      I attach at Annexes D and E drafts of the reply to the French Government and of the declaration mentionedin para, 7 (c) above.A.E,Foreign Office, S,W,1,21ST FEBRUARY, 1953*
MX AFRBNOH MEMORANDUM COMMUNICATED BY M.  BIDAULTDated 12th February, 1955TRANSLATIONThe British Government communicated to the French Governmenton 2lj-th January certain suggestions for military association between united Kingdom forces and the European Defence forces,&apos;     these suggestions, as the British memorandum brought out, dealt only withthe technical aspects of military co-operation between the unitedKingdom and the European Defence Community, and even so did not represent final recommendations.     The United Kingdom Governmentconcluded by reaffirming their desire that the close links established in the field between the United Kingdom forces and the european defence forces should also be reflected in close relations between theUnited Kingdom and the military and political institutions of theE.D.C.; i2. The French Government has carefully studied these suggestions:,These appear to be useful, bearing in mind the limited framework within which the British Government suggested launching this study.The French Government would stress, however, the advantage of tacklingimmediately the entire problem of British association with the E.D. C.from three aspects:   the technical association of British forces andthe European Defence forces, the maintenance of British forces on theContinent and British political participation in the institutions ofthe Community,3. The French Government considers that there is an essential difference between the Coal and Steel Community and the E,D,C,     Noco-operation exists at present between the British heavy industries and the European heavy industries, whereas the Treaty of 27th May, 1952between Great Britain and the member states of the E.D.C,, thepresence of British divisions and European divisions within the sameforce, the close links which must be established between thosedivisions at the technical level, the possibility foreseen in theE,D,C, Treaty of associating European divisions with British divisions?together involve an organic co-operation of the United Kingdom forces and those of the E,D,C,     It is desirable therefore to define themethods of co-operation and to draw the consequences,k* The French Government recognises that the British government does not believe it possible to. ap;ree to any surrender of sovereignty in favour of a European Defence organisation and hence considers itimpossible to adhere to the E.D.C. Treaty.     Although the situation ofFrance is wholly comparable to that of Great Britain, the FrenchGovernment does not believe that it would serve any purpose to press the British Government to reconsider their decision.     They believe,however, that in the common interest, a relationship of organicco-operation going further than mere association must be established between Great Britain and the E.D.C.The formula envisaged by the French Government would allow the United Kingdom, without having to become a party to the E.D.C.Treaty, to enjoy in relation to the Community, political rightscorresponding to the responsibilities which she would assume towardsit and to the contribution which she already places at the disposalof the Supreme Allied Commander on the Continent.5.        At this point it is pertinent to remark that Great Britain1sexisting undertakings are indefinite in the matter of the level ofBritish forces stationed on the Continent.
The problem of a German defence contribution arose in the context of the &quot;forward strategy&quot; agreed in common by the AtlanticNations,      In order to solve that problem, Prance alone of the three great Powers has agreed to accept important sacrificies of sovereignty,.The French Government considers that it would be natural for GreatBritain, who is also a European power from the point of view of hersecurity and for whom the maintenance of the &quot;forward strategy&quot; hasvital importance, to make a further effort in order to show readiness to contribute to the success of the &quot;forward strategy&quot;,6, The French Government knows the difficulties which theBritish General Staff see in giving an undertaking relating to themaintenance of a fixed level of forces on the Continent.     They would point out, however, that Great Britain, who has on the   Continentonly an expeditionary corps, is in any case in a much more favourable position than France, who also has overseas responsibilities and thegreat majority of whose forces had been placed at the disposal of theSupreme Allied Commander by virtue of Article 18 of the E.D.C.Treaty,The French Government realises that the drafting of such anundertaking would raise certain difficulties.     They suggest, however.,that these difficulties might be overcome if an undertaking tomaintain British forces at their present level were combined with a clause providing that, in the event of a serious crisis overseasinvolving the withdrawal of British forces, consultation would takeplace with the object of making good the size, composition and quality of the available forces allocated to SACEUR and stationed inEurope,7* In order to get round the difficulties involved either in an indefinite undertaking or an undertaking for fifty years, thesolution towards which the French Government is moving would be toestablish a relationship between the maintenance of British forces attheir present level and British political participation in the institutions of the Community,So long as British forces on the Continent remain at theirpresent level, Great Britain would enjoy, within the institutions ofthe Community, political rights which might be as follows:-A Minister designated by the united Kingdom Government andrepresenting it would take part in the meetings of the Council ofMinisters of the Community whenever questions affecting co-operationbetween the United Kingdom forces and the European Defence forces were under discussion,.X ... Members of Parliament of the United Kingdom would attend as observers meetings of the Assembly of the Community whenthe latter was discussing questions affecting the object of theTreaty signed in Paris on 27th May, 1952 between the United Kingdomand the member states of the Community or the arrangements mentionedin the present paper;   these observers would be authorised by thePresident of the Assembly to participate in debates with adeliberative voice.Finally, the British Government would appoint arepresentative to the Board of   Commissioners of the E.D.C. to-handle the practical questions arising from the present memorandum.

COMTE DE CROUY-CHANEL ON 20TH FEBRUARY a 1953The Government of the United Kingdom on the one hand,the Governments of the states signatories to the Treaty estab-lishing the E.D. C. on the other hand,Having regard to the Treaty signed in Paris on.27th May 1952 between the United Kingdom and the states membersof the E. D. C. ;Having regard to the Conventions signed in Bonn on26th May 1952 and the Tripartite Declaration of the Governmentsof the U. S. A. , France and the United Kingdom signed in Paris on27th May 1952;Consider that these dispositions involve an organicco-operation between the forces of the United Kingdom and thoseof the E.D.C. ;Believe that it is desirable to define the methods ofthat co-operation and to work out a form of association whichwould permit the Government of the United Kingdom without,however, becoming a party to the Treaty establishing the E.D.C.,to enjoy in relation to the Community a position corresponding to the responsibilities which they assume towards it and to the contribution which they place at the disposal of the supreme commander on the European Continent;Have accordingly agreed as follows:Article 1     The Government of the United Kingdomundertake to contribute by all means in their power to strengthe:.the military efficiency and the potential of the E.D.C.They will maintain at their present level their armed forces stationed on the European Continent and co-operating withthe forces of the E.D.C.If, on account of a serious crisis affecting non-European territory for which they have assumed defenceresponsibilities, the British Government are obliged to with-draw a part of the contingents placed at the disposal of SACEURand stationed on the European Continent, the United Kingdom will immediately consult with the competent N.A.T. 0. supreme commander in order to re-establish the size, composition and quality of the forces immediately available at the disposal ofthe Supreme Commander on the European Continent.Article 2     In order to strengthen the military co-operation-operation between the European forces and the armed forcesof the United Kingdom, joint committees will study the progressive unification of training methods, regulations ofmanoeuvre and technical vocabulary.     The schools establised for the Training of the officers of the Community will call onthe assistance of British officers.     Officers of the Europeanforces will be temporarily seconded to the forces of the UnitedKingdom and vice versa.
In the domains of the land and the air, military-co-operation will be organised in accordance with the generaldirectives set out in an annexed memorandum.If it seems desirable to the various interestedauthorities, formations of the European Defence Forces couldbe associated with British divisions.Article 3     The armament, equipment and supply-programmes of the European Defence forces will be co-co-ordinated with the corresponding programmes of the United Kingdom forces from the point of view of production and standardisation.Wherever possible common production programmes will beestablished.It is understood that these provisions will not havethe effect of subjecting the United Kingdom to the system of licences laid down in Article 107 of the Treaty establishing the E.D.C.Article k     So long as the conditions laid down inArticle 1 of the present Protocol are fulfilled, the UnitedKingdom Government will enjoy the following position in regardto their participation in the institutions of the E,D,C,:a Minister appointed by and representing the UnitedKingdom Government will participate in meetings of the Councilof Ministers of the E.D.C, when questions affecting co-operationbetween the forces of the United Kingdom and the forces of theCommunity are being discussed,X ,,, Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdomappointed by the latter will attend, in the role of observers,meetings of the Assembly of the Community,     When the latter isdiscussing the questions affecting the object of the Treatysigned in Paris on 27th May 1952 between the United Kingdom andthe states raembersof the E.D.C. or affecting the object of thepresent Protocol, these observers are authorised by thePresident of the Assembly to take part in the debates with theright to speak but not to vote.The British Government will appoint a representative to the Board of Commissioners of the E, D,C, to handle all questions of application raised by the present Protocol,
ANNEX 0INTERIM COMMISSIONOP THE CONFERENCE FOR THE ORGANISATION OF THEEUROPEAN DEFENCE COMMUNITY &quot;*NOTE BY THE UNITED KINGDOM DELEGATIONMILITARY ASSOCIATION BETWEEN UNITED KINGDOM FORCES and european DEFENCE FORGESWhen Lord Alexander, the United Kingdom Minister ofDefence, visited Paris in May of last year, he assured M. Plevenof the wish of Her Majesty1s Government to arrange for the closest possible association between their forces and those ofthe E. D.C.     The two Ministers of Defence had a preliminary discussion of the means whereby such association might beachieved,2, The United Kingdom Delegation wish the interim commission to know that Her Majesty&apos;s Government remain convincedthat an efficient working relationship between their forces andthose of the E.D.C. will be of advantage to both parties and is indeed essential in the interests of N.A. T. 0, as a whole.     they believe that such a relationship should be allowed to developprogressively from practical experience and should not be definedtoo rigidly in advance.      In order, however, to give the interim commission a clearer idea of the extent to which they believetheir forces on the Continent might be associated with those ofthe E.D. C, , Her Majesty1s Government have prepared a list of themethods of practical collaboration which they suggest might be pursued,3, This list, which is annexed, deals with the three services in turn and considers, in each case, first the assistance which United Kingdom forces might give the European Defence forces during their formative stage and then possible forms of long-termassociation when the European Defence forces are fully established^It is probably in air matters that association can be most fully developed, but suggestions relating to the land and naval forces have also been included,14* The United Kingdom authorities hope that by submittingthis paper they will remove any misunderstandings that may existabout the nature of the military association with the E.D. C,which Her Majesty1 s Government desire.     They would be gratefulif the paper could be communicated to the interested governments and would welcome consideration of it by the Interim Commission.They would be very ready to give sympathetic consideration to any suggestions made by the Interim Commission for any other formsof collaboration.5m In conclusion the United Kingdom Delegation wish to reaffirm the earnest desire of Her Majesty1s Government that the close relations established in the field between the forces ofthe United Kingdom and of the E.D.C. will also be reflected inclose relationship between the United Kingdom and the militaryand political institutions of the E.D*C,
LIST OF SUGGESTIONS FOR PRACTICAL COLLABORATION between british FORCES AND THE EUROPEAN DEFENCE FORCES-AIR FORCESAssistance1, The Royal Air Force would be glad:-(a) to provide further specialist staff officers towork in the air planning teams within the interim commission;(b) to second officers, at all levels, to the european defence forces for cormaxid, flying and staff service(including the technical and administrative fields);(c) to give special assistance, if requested, in theformation of the European Air Defence Command andTraining Command;(d) to give assistance in the establishment of a european Air Ministry, including the secondmentof officers, if desired;(e) to provide, in the case of European Air Forces ofGerman origin:-&apos;- some initial flying and technical refreshertraining;- assistance in the organisation of and supervisionin technical schools.Association2, When the European Air Force is fully established, a close association of the R.A.F. formations in 2nd Allied Tactical Air Forecould be effected with it.     This association, subject to theapproval of SACEUR, could be on the following lines:-(a) officers could be seconded from 2nd A.T.A.F. tothe European Air Force and vice versa for Flightand Squadron Commander posts;(b) 2nd A.T.A.F, could accept responsibility for train-ing any squadrons of German origin that might be nominated by the European Defence Community;(c) R,A,F, squadrons could be placed under EuropeanAir Force Command, and vice versa, in jointtraining exercises, under the overall command of SACEUR.Participation in the European Air Ministry3, Staff officers could be seconded for duty with theEuropean Air Ministry at all levels, particularly for tasks inconnection with paragraphs 2(a), 2(c) and 6,Secondment of R.A.F. officers the R.A.F. could second officers to the European defence forces at all levels for command, flying and staff service (includinthe technical and administrative fields.
&apos;o4Integrated Headquarters Staff5* The R.A.F,. would be ready to participate in an integratedheadquarters staff.Interchange of Air Force Squadrons6. Individual European Air Force squadrons and completeEuropean Air Force wings could be accepted within R,A,F,&apos; formations,and vice versa, where military considerations make this desirable and logistic considerations make it practicable.Air Defence7* The R.A,F, would provide advice and assistance in theorganisation of European air defence, including the setting up of close links between the control and reporting systems of the european defence Community and the United Kingdom Fighter Command,Training and Production8, The United Kingdom authorities would be prepared to. examinethe possibility of correlating the aircraft production programmes of the E,D,C, and the United Kingdom and also of having a commonair training programme,ARMIES9* Association between the British and European Armies maynecessarily be limited to some extent by differences in organisations,tactical doctrines, logistics, staff work and type of equipmentbetween the two Armies,Assistance10,       The British Army would be glad to co-operate in the early stages of the formation of the European Army in, for example, the fields of training and logistics, whilst in the sphere of land/airwarfare the Army could assist the European Defence forces in the planning of their organisation and training.      In particular:-(a) a small number of officers could be secondedto the headquarters of the European defence forces and to its training and logistic staff;(b) for training in land/air warfare, a number of vacancies could be allotted to the european defence forces at the United Kingdom School ofLand/Air Warfare, and signal exercises and full-scale exercises in Europe to include British and european Defence forces troops and aircraft couldbe arranged;(c) European Defence Force Units could take part information training with the British Army of the rhine, in the same fashion as the Belgian and dutch Units do at present, and vice versa;(d) British Army of the Rhine could produce suitabletactical demonstrations at the request of theEuropean Defence forces.
)C7Association11*    (a)   Some European Defence force officers could serve on the integrated staff of Northern Army GroupHeadquarters (British Army of the Rhine; as staff officers of national forces serve at present withthese Headquarters;    and vice versa,(b)   British formations could be made temporarilyavailable for training with the European defence forces under the overall command of SAGEUR, andBritish Army Corps would be ready to acceptEuropean. Defence Force Groupements under theircommand.NAVIES12,       There is not as much scope for the Royal Navy to develop itsassociation with the European Defence forces as there is for the Armyand the Royal Air Force,     The Royal Navy would, however, be glad toco-operate in the following ways:-(a) by participating in exercises which include EuropeanNaval Forces;(b) by advising on the development of the European Navy,including naval forces of German origin;(c) by the provision of training facilities for naval forces of German origin.
ANNEX. DDRAFT REPLY TO THE FRENCH MEMORANDUMHer Majesty&apos;s Government have given the most carefuland sympathetic consideration to the French Government&apos;s memo-randum which was communicated by M, Bidault to Mr, Eden on12th February,2, Her Majesty&apos;s Government were glad to note that inthe White Paper recently laid before the French Assembly it isstated that the problem of a very close association of GreatBritain with the E.D.C, is in large measure resolved.     They alsoshare the view expressed in the French Memorandum that contractualengagements already concluded, notably the Treaty of 27th May 1952between the United Kingdom and the member states of the E,D,C, ,and physical facts such as the joint presence on German soil ofBritish and European divisions, both forming part of SACEUR&apos;forces, require alike the closest co-operation, the forms of whichcan now be defined in more detail,3* Her Majesty&apos;s Government are no less conscious than theFrench Government of the importance of a forward strategy in thedefence of Western Europe,     They have made this plain by theirpolicy in the Atlantic Alliance and by undertaking commitments which, to quote again from the French White Paper, &quot;bind GreatBritain more tightly than ever before to the defence of theEuropean Continent&quot;,      In spite of economic difficulties and otherheavy military commitments overseas, more especially in the middle east, Korea and Malaya, the United Kingdom is maintaining strongforces on the Continent, including three armoured divisions (the strongest armoured force available to SACEUH) and a considerableair strength.     These are supported by an expanding armaments industry, the development of atomic weapons and guided missiles,and the large-scale production of jet aircraft for military purposes,h* The presence of strong British forces on the Continent,who will operate side by side with the European defence forces under the command of SACEUR, will necessitate the closest possibleco-operation at the technical level.     Her Majesty&apos;s government hope that the paper they put forward on 2kth January in the interim Commission of the E,D.C, containing far-reaching and practical proposals to achieve this, will lead to useful discussionof this aspect of the problem and to early agreement on thepractical measures required,5* Her Majesty&apos;s Government also desire to establish the closest links with the military and political institutions of theE. D. C,     They are ready to consider any arrangements which may beagreeable to the six Governments,     They suggest, however, thatthe most useful links might be:-(a) the appointment of a British mission to theBoard of Commissioners, which could leadto the establishment of a Joint Committeeand any other desired joint Working Parties,to handle the practical problems of co-operation between United Kingdom forces and the European Defence forces;(b) the appointment of a British representative to attend special meetings of the Councilof Ministers of the E,D*C. to discuss thegeneral policy of the United Kingdom/E.D.C.co-operation and to consult on matters of mutual concern.
6. The purpose of such links is to provide machineryfor effective and continuous co-operation and consultation betweenthe United Kingdom and the E.D.C.     Her Majesty&apos;s government consider therefore that it would be a mistake to suggest thatthese links should exist only so long as British forces on theContinent remain at their present level.      In their view, these linkewill be required in all circumstances and are justified not only by practical requirements but also by the Treaty engagementswhich Her Majesty&apos;s Government have already assumed towardsPrance and also towards the other members of the E.D.C.1* As regards the level of her armed forces, the UnitedKingdom, like other N. A. T. 0. powers, has undertaken commitmentsunder- the N.A. T.0. Annual Review.     Her Majesty1 s government consider that major decisions of policy regarding Western defence,notably the nature and size of national contributions as well asthe location of forces, must be taken in N.A.T. 0., and theyregret that they cannot commit themselves unilaterally to maintainindefinitely on the Continent forces at their present level.     Theposition of the United Kingdom is different from that of theContinental powers in the sense that British forces on theContinent are already stationed overseas.     In view of her other overseas obligations and of the limitations which necessarilyexist on her defence effort, the United Kingdom must preserve ameasure of flexibility and avoid too rigid a commitment of forces to any one theatre.8. The United Kingdom and Prance are already linked by aseries of Treaties and other Agreements which reflect theimportance which Her Majesty&apos;s Government attach to Frenchsecurity and the maintenance of a close and effective co-operationwith the French Government and people.     Her Majesty&apos;s government wish to make it clear that the establishment of the E.D.C. doesnot in any way diminish or impair the full force of the existing obligations of the United Kingdom under these Treaties and agreements.9. The Treaty of 27th May, 1952, concluded between theUnited Kingdom and the members of the E.D.C. and the tripartite declaration of the same date demonstrate, in particular, thepractical support of Her Majesty&apos;s Government for the E.D.C.In the Tripartite Declaration, the United Kingdom and UnitedStates Governments expressed their resolve to station such forces on the Continent as they deem necessary and appropriate to thejoint defence of the North Atlantic Treaty having regard, among other things, to their interest in the integrity of the european defence Community,     Her Majesty&apos;s Government recognise that theobligations in the Tripartite Declaration and the United Kingdom/E.D. C. Treaty are linked with their membership of N.A. T.0.     Anextension of the North Atlantic Treaty from twenty to fifty years to make it co-terminous with the E.D.C. Treaty as suggested inthe Declaration signed by the Foreign Ministers of the six member countries of the E.D.C. on 27th May, 1952, would extend these obligations for a corresponding period and provide France withan additional safeguard.     Her Majesty&apos;s Government would accordingly be willing to join the E.D.C. Governments in an approach to the United States Government, and, if the UnitedStates Government are agreeable, to make a joint proposal to theother N.A.T. 0. countries to extend the North iitlantic treaty for an additional period of thirty years.10. Her Majesty*s Government&apos;s firm support for the E.D.C.is clearly demonstrated by their proposals for militaryassociation at a technical level, by their readiness to work outon the above lines a system of close association with the militaryand political instituions of the E.D.C. and by the far-reaching
1*0international commitments which they have already undertaken.Her Majesty&apos;s Government would he prepared to rehearse in a formal declaration the engagements which they have already under-taken, and the further measures which they are prepared to take to achieve the closest possible association with the E.D.C.Her Majesty&apos;s Government would propose that the text of this declaration, a draft of which is enclosed, together with copiesof this Memorandum, should be communicated to the other E.D. 0^ .Governments to serve as a basis for joint discussion with them.
///ANNEX EDRAFT DECLARATIONHer Majesty&apos;s Government in the United. Kingdom regard the entry into force of the Treaty instituting the european defence Community as an essential factor in strengthening thedefence of the free world through the North Atlantic treaty organisation.     Together with the Treaty instituting theEuropean Coal and Steel Community and the Conventions signedwith the German Federal Republic, it marks a new phase in the evolution of the European Community within the Atlantic CommunityoThe fact that the United Kingdom is not a member of theEuropean Defence Community in no way detracts from the importance which Her Majesty1s Government attach to the security, economic progress and well-being of the countries of Western Europe, nor does it indicate any weakening in their resolve to play a full and active part in the plans for the military, political and economic association of the Free World.In addition to their obligations and their contributions to Western defence through the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation,Her Majesty&apos;s Government have amply demonstrated their practicalsupport for the European Defence Community and their desire toestablish the closest possible association with the Communityat all stages of its political and military development.
