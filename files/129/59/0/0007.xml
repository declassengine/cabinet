CONFIDENTIAL,C. (53) 57 COPY NO.11th FEBRUARY, 1953.CABINETREDUCTION IN GRANTS FOR LIBERAL ADULT education memorandum by the Minister of EducationMy Department pays grants direct to certain non-official&quot;Responsible Bodies&quot; which conduct classes in liberal adult education.2. The grants to these Bodies have risen rapidly since the end ofthe war.   This is partly a result of an increase in the number of classesattracting grant, partly a result of rising salary costs.   The actual figures are as follows (the figures are for the financial year throughout):-WORKERSEDUCATIONALYEAR	UNIVERSITIES	ASSOCIATION	TOTAL193 8/1939	 72,000	 13,500	 85,5001946/1947	 129,000	 42,000	 171,0001947/1948	 172,800	 49,500	 222,3001948/1949	 207,500	 56,800	 264,3001949/1950	 232,000	 64,800	 296,8001950/1951	 258,900	 63,100	 322,0001951/1952	 262,800	 65,500	 328,3001952/1953	 267,000	 67,000	 334,0003. Quite soon after taking over the Department I decided that, withthe many increasing commitments I had to face in other directions, I mustcall a halt to this continued rise; and in April 1952 I told the UniversitiesCouncil of Adult Education and the Workers Educational Association that I proposed to put a &quot;ceiling&quot; to their grants for the year 1952-1953, which would limit them to the amounts they had received for the previous year.   Theywere also warned at that time that I might have to contemplate more drastic measures in the following year.4. This year, faced with a still larger increase in my Estimates,I felt I must consider the possibility of a cut more fully.   I therefore hadcareful enquiries made both about the probable effects of a reduction in the grants and about the quality of the work which is being done.   These enquiriesmade it clear that some of the work is not up to the standard we ought to require.They also led me to the conclusion that a small cut, of not more than 10 per cent,could be made without inflicting serious injury on the structure of this service,-1-
B6It appeared that it might even have certain advantages, if it led to anelimination of some work of doubtful quality.50 I also concluded that it would be reasonable in presentcircumstances to expect that these bodies should look for a slightly larger proportion of their revenue from sources other than my Department, inparticular from the fees paid by students attending the classes.   This lastitem at present only accounts for about 3 per cent of the total cost of the work;and in a large proportion of classes the fee is only a few shillings a headfor the entire course.   In my opinion the revenue from this source might wellbe increased in present circumstances.6. In making these cuts I have given the bodies concerned the longest possible warning.   Instead of bringing in the cuts at the beginning of thefinancial year, I have said I will postpone them until the beginning of the educational year i. e. August 1st, and that I will continue the grants at present rates until then.   This gives them ample time to make their dispositions.But it of course means that the saving is less.   I expect that the total saving to be secured by my proposed 10 per cent cut and a correspondingcut in my grants to other smaller bodies will be about  25,000 in the financialyear 1953-1954, and some  35,000 in a full year.7. The activities in question form only a part of the total provisionfor liberal adult education in the country.   Considerable provision is made also by local education authorities, both in evening institutes and in residentialcolleges providing short courses.   When seen against this wider background,the cuts which I am proposing are in my view fully justified; and if theyare justified on the merits of the case I do not think we should be deflectedfrom them simply because the people directly affected happen to be speciallyvocal.8. The whole of this paper is concerned only with liberal adulteducation, i. e. courses in subjects such as economics, literature, psychologyand the arts.   There is no question of any cut in my grants for the technical and vocational training of adults.   On the contrary this service is beingdeliberately expanded.9. I shall shortly be receiving a deputation from the universities and the Workers Educational Association to discuss my proposals.   I ask mycolleagues to agree that, apart from questions of detail on which newinformation may be forthcoming, I should stand by my proposal to make the cut in my Departments grants mentioned in paragraph 4 above.F.H.Ministry of Education, W. 1.11th February, 1953,
