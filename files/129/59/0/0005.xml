Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1953CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 7 0C. (53) 559th February, 1953CABINETTEACHERS&apos; SUPERANNUATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland and theMinister of education in accordance with the Conclusion reached by the Home Affairs Committeeon 30th January (H.A. (53) 2nd Meeting, Item 5) we submit to the Cabinet thequestion of legislation to amend the present law relating to teachers&apos; super-annuation in England and Wales and in Scotland.2. Under the existing Superannuation Acts an annual contribution of10 per cent. (5 per cent, from the teacher and 5 per cent, from the employer) is payable to secure the benefits under the Acts and an actuarial enquiry has to be heldevery 7 years to determine whether the rate of contribution is sufficient or notto support the benefits. There are no Superannuation Funds. The contributions areappropriated in aid of the Votes of the Education Departments and the super -anriuation benefits are charged against those Votes. But the Acts require Accountsto be kept of all income and expenditure under the Schemes.3. The first septennial enquiry by the Government Actuary related to theposition as at 31st March, 1933, and his Report showed that, in the case of Englandand Wales, the solvency of the Scheme would require a contribution rate of12 per cent. The Government of the day decided, however, that no action shouldbe taken to increase contributions in view of the short time for which the Act hadbeen in force. In the case of Scotland the enquiry disclosed a small surplus ofabout    million.4. The next enquiry, due to be held as at 31st March, .1940, had to be post-poned owing to the war. It was, in fact, held in relation to the position as at31st March, 1948. The Actuary&apos;s Reports (issued early in 1951) showed that mainlyowing to the upward revisions of salaries since 31st March, 1933, the actuarialdeficiency in the case of England and Wales had risen from about  10 millionsat that date to about  102 millions as at.31st March, 1948. This deficiency of 102 millions will, it is estimated, have grown to some  165 millions by 31st March,1953. mainly owing to salary increases granted in April, 1951, and July, 1952, butpartly owing to the interest, at 3^ per cent., deemed to have accrued on the deficiency of  102 millions since 1948. In the case of Scotland the surplus at31st March, 1933, had become a deficiency of some  Hi millions by 3.1st March,1948, and it is estimated that this will have grown to a deficiency of  23 millionsby 31st March, 1953. Thus, the total deficiency at that date may be put at 188 millions.5. We are satisfied that in this situation there must be some increase in therate of contribution, but that it would be unfair to teachers and their employers to require them to bear the full burden of the deficiencies disclosed. We are agreedthat the liquidation of the deficiencies should be borne partly by the teachers andtheir employers and partly by the Exchequer.6. -We accordingly propose that a Bill should be introduced forthwith toraise the rate of contribution at the earliest possible date from 10 per cent, to12 per cent, (divided equally between teacher and employer) and to place the43704
liability for the balance of the deficiencies upon the Exchequer. It is estimatedthat, on the basis of the position as at 31st March, 1953, the additional contribution of 2 per cent, would serve to meet some  69 millions of the total deficiency of  188 millions, leaving a liability of some  119 millions to be assumed.by theExchequer. Since there are no Superannuation Funds, the liability to be assumed by the Exchequer would not require any immediate equivalent cash payment; an appropriate adjustment would be made in the credits shown in the accounts.7. We have also had it in mind to use the opportunity offered by the proposed bill to amend the existing Acts in order to encourage teachers to remain inteaching service or to return to it and thereby to ease the present shortage of teachers. The main amendments would be concerned with raising the age ofpensionable service from 65 to 70 and making certain improvements in benefits.There would also be included a few minor adjustments which experience has shown to be called for in the existing Acts.8. With the concurrence of the Home Affairs Committee (H.A. (52) 30thMeeting, Item 4), proposals on the basis described above have been discussed bythe Education Departments with the local authorities and the teachers. In Englandand Wales the associations of teachers are naturally opposed to an increase in therate of contribution, although they appear to recognise that it is smaller than might have been expected. The associations of local authorities and the LondonCounty Council are opposed to any legislation on the lines proposed and insist upon the need for a wider examination of the whole basis of teachers&apos; super-annuation with a view to the introduction of a comprehensive and agreed Billbased on consultation with the interested parties as has been done in the case ofthe Local Government Superannuation Bill. The associations see no urgency in measures designed to eliminate the present heavy and growing liability of theExchequer for teachers&apos; pensions. They are opposed to &quot; piecemeal&quot; legislation and say that, if any Bill other than a comprehensive Bill is introduced, they wouldhave to recommend that it be strongly opposed.In Scotland the associations of teachers are likewise hostile to legislation toraise the rate of contribution. But the Association of County Councils have accepted the proposals put before them and so have the Association of Councils of counties and Cities, with the exception of Glasgow.9. We regret that the associations of local authorities in England and wales have adopted so uncompromising an attitude. We consider that there is muchto be said for the wider examination of the problem for which they ask, so longas it is clearly accepted that teachers&apos; superannuation must remain on a fullcontributory footing. But it seems to us essential to safeguard the interests of theExchequer by an immediate increase in the contribution rate and to put theSchemes on a solvent footing. We therefore consider that our proposals for handling the immediate problem of the accumulated liability are sound anddefensible and that to give way to the teachers and to the local authorities inEngland and Wales would be both weak and unjustifiable. Our proposals neednot prejudice the wider examination on which the authorities insist. Moreover,to raise the contribution rate to 12 per cent, would not only help to check the growing Exchequer liability but would also afford immediate savings to the votes of the Education Departments to the extent of some  2 millions in England andWales and some  275,000 in Scotland in a full year and this considerationassumes a special importance in view of the present urgent need to reduce thecurrent charge upon the Exchequer.10. We should also&apos;like to see included in the Bill the additional provisions which are mentioned in paragraph 7 above and which we believe that the teacherswould regret to see excluded. But, if there is to be a wider examination of thewhole problem, their inclusion in the Bill would look like anticipating the resultof the wider examination. Of more immediate practical importance is the factthat, in view of the attitude of the teachers on both sides of the Border and ofthe local authorities in England and Wales, the Bill would inevitably be con-controversial and would presumably have to be taken at all stages on the floor of theHouse. If so, the question of Parliamentary time becomes a factor of prime importance and points to procedure by way of a short interim Bill limited solely to provisions for raising the rate of contribution and to adjusting the Accounts inrespect of existing deficiencies.    .
9th February, 1953.11. The position is admittedly rather different in Scotland in view of theforthcoming attitude of the local authorities (except Glasgow) and the Secretaryof State would prefer to retain the provisions for raising the age of pensionableservice and for improving benefits. If these provisions were retained for Scotland,they would need aiso to be retained for England and Wales and that would mean a Bill of appreciably greater length than the short interim measure mentioned inthe preceding paragraph.12,   We accordingly ask the Cabinet id) to agree that there should be early legislation to deal with teachers&apos;superannuation; and,(b) to decide whether the Bill should be a short interim measure limitedsolely to raising the rate of contribution and putting the super-annuation Schemes on a solvent footing: or whether it should includealso the additional provisions mentioned in paragraph 7 above.J.
