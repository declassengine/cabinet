THIS DOCUMENT-IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(53) 916th MARCH, 1953.STERLING AREA TRADE WITH JAPAN IN 1953.Memorandum by the Economic Secretary to the Treasury.The Report by the Economic Policy Committee annexed to C. (53)88sets out the issues involved in the present discussions with Japan.2. The main fact is that Japan is now in substantial deficit with the sterling area, largely as a result of the import restrictions which we introducedlast year, and which we are still maintaining.3. It is of great importance to us to maintain the Sterling payments agreement and the principles upon which it is based, namely that there should bea balance in the trade between the sterling area and Japan, and that japan should be induced to conduct the major part of her trade in sterling.   At the sametime we must recognise that to maintain import restrictions, except for balance ofpayments reasons, is totally contrary to our general trade and payments policies and to the approach which we are now making to the American Government.4, The Agreement commits us &quot;to take all reasonable measures toprevent or correct, should it occur, any chronic imbalance of payments in eitherdirection&quot;.   There is such an imbalance at the moment in our favour.   The question to be determined therefore is what are &quot;all reasonable measures&quot;?5. Sterling area imports from Japan fell in 1952 from an annual rate of 271 millions in the first half to  148 millions in the second half.   They are at presentsubstantially lower still.   Japanese imports from the sterling area, so long as shedoes not impose restrictions, will be some  190 millions.   In addition, she expects to make invisible payments amounting to some  4 millions and to transfer some 10 millions to third countries.   The gap between the annual rate of Japanesesterling receipts in the second half of 1952 and their prospective sterling payment in 1953 is therefore  56 millions.6. Clearly in these circumstances we are obliged to make some relaxation of our import restrictions though not, of course, to the full extent of 56 millions.7. The majority of the Economic Policy Committee recommendrelaxations amounting to some  18 - 22 millions.   They consider that with theserelaxations, and with pressure on the Japanese to reduce or, if possible, eliminatetheir net outward flow of sterling to third countries, the prospective deficit in 1953 will be reduced to a figure which the Japanese should accept.   Theyconsider that these concessions are the maximum that it is politically possible tooffer.COPY NO.CABINET
8. I do not believe that these proposals will be acceptable to theJapanese.   If they are not, and if the Japanese are told that they are final,they will immediately impose severe import restrictions.   They will at thesame time be able to claim, and we shall find it difficult to deny, that theyare being forced to do this because, while up till now they have been maintaining their purchases from us, we have been continuing to retain severe restrictionson Japanese imports which can no longer be justified on balance of paymentsgrounds.9. We shall therefore be in the position both of appearing to break our agreement, and of maintaining unjustifiable import restrictions, which willboth re-awaken all the old suspicions of the United Kingdom in sterling area countries, and run entirely counter to the whole policy of non-discrimination and relaxation of restrictions for which the Chancellor of the Exchequer isat this moment arguing hi Washington.   It will also be the end of the policyembodied in our Sterling Payments Agreement with Japan, which is greatly to the advantage of the United Kingdom and of the sterling area.   Japaneserestrictions will also without doubt cause a sharp reaction from other commonwealth countries who are the main source of Japanese imports fromthe sterling area.10. I therefore ask the Cabinet to say that the offer proposed by themajority of the Economic Policy Committee shall not be regarded as a finaloffer. If it proves unacceptable to the Japanese, our representatives shouldbe instructed -(a) to make every effort to dissuade them from imposing restrictions; and(b) to report back the minimum terms necessary to secure a settlement.R.M.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.6th March, 1953.
