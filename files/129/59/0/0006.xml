I. introduction. The proposals in this Memorandum are intended to provide a basis for collective action by the United States, the Commonwealth and Western Europe tocreate the conditions for freer trade and currencies and thus to provide the frame-work for expansion of world production and trade.2. The United Kingdom Government would, at the outset, wish to set out some of the general considerations which have led it to propose, and the other commonwealth Governments to support, a new initiative in international economic policy.3. First, we believe that the success of the free world in solving its economic problems is of decisive importance in the struggle against Soviet communism.Economic instability breeds political instability. The lack of opportunities for economic progress both in advanced countries and in under-developed countries is both a check to national defence and a stimulus to communism. Correspondingly,the creation of economic strength and opportunity supports the moral and materialno less than the political resistance to communism. The collective defence effort which is being made in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) mustbe underpinned by a sound economic development among its members.4. Secondly, it is time for a new start. For the last seven years the countries of the free world have been repairing the ravages of war and taking the initial stepsto put their defences in order. Much has been accomplished by the efforts of the peoples themselves, supported by massive United States aid. Now it is time to lookahead, and to set in train more positive policies; the longer the delay, the greater the danger that the restrictive policies which were inevitable for dealing with the initial post-war problems will become permanently embedded in the world economy.5. Thirdly, the United Kingdom is seeking a solution of economic problems in terms of &quot;Trade, not Aid.&quot; The keynote of economic policy must be theexpansion of world production and trade. Although business activity throughoutthe world is still at a very high level, the post-war sellers&quot; market has worked itselfout. If the free world fails to adopt a policy of expansion, a frustrating and damaging stagnation of the world economy may result.6. The proposals in this Memorandum are put forward for discussion, in thehope that from them will emerge an internationally agreed plan which would enablereal progress to be made towards freer trade and currencies. The proposals were discussed comprehensively at the recent Commonwealth Economic Conference,and the other Commonwealth Governments Canada, Australia, New Zealand,South Africa, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Southern Rhodesia and the chief Colonies are in general agreement with them. It was agreed at the Conference that theUnited Kingdom Government should explore with the United States Governmentin the first instance the possibility of securing international agreement for a courseof action on these lines. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom and other Common-wealth Governments are not committed to these proposals; their final decisionsmust await the emergence of a specific plan from the series of international con-consultations which is envisaged.7. The United Kingdom Government proposes, therefore, that the first stage of discussions with the United States Administration should be exploratory. If itappears likely in the light of these discussions that a suitable plan can be foundwhich would make possible a real and decisive advance to freer trade and cur-currencies, the United Kingdom would have exploratory discussions with France,Benelux, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries, meanwhilekeeping the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.) dulyinformed. There would of course be need for further consultation : within theCommonwealth. It would then be possible to proceed with definite negotiations to bring a specific plan into effect.8. In taking this initiative, the United Kingdom Government is conscious thata definite programme of action to bring about freer trade and currencies will involverisks and difficulties, both for the United Kingdom and for other countries. Butwe believe that the advantages to be secured from an improved international economic system outweigh the risks, and the proposals which are made here are designed to reduce the risks as far as possible. But risks will remain and difficulties will have to be overcome. This is why the United Kingdom Government decided
to initiate international discussions, so that a collective plan could be worked out and the policies of the United States, the Commonwealth and Western Europedirected towards common objectives, with the aim of providing the greatest possible strengthening and cohesion of the economies of the free world.9. The United Kingdom Government would emphasise its awareness thatits proposals carry important consequences, for other Western European countries.That is why the proposals are directed towards the preparation of a collective plan,in which Western European countries would participate fully, together with theUnited States and the Commonwealth. The United Kingdom Government does not,see in these proposals any weakening of its links with Western Europe. The pro-posals will certainly involve some changes in the existing financial arrangements in western Europe, but this was always inevitable when the time came for advance to a wider freedom of trade and currencies. But it is the aim of the United King-dom Government to use every effort to ensure that a plan is framed which willstrengthen the Western European economy, and provide a more solid foundation for Western European political and military strength than the present arrangements can possibly do.II. Background of the Proposals(A) Internal Policies10. International economic policies cannot succeed unless they are backed bysound internal policies-and this applies particularly to the debtor countries. TheCommonwealth countries have recognised this. At the Commonwealth EconomicConference they engaged themselves to pursue economic stability by curbinginflation and by sound economic development. In the Communique of the Con-ference, the highest authorities in all the Commonwealth countries have accepted this obligation in categorical terms. In varying degrees corrective steps have beentaken in all Commonwealth countries, and these Governments intend to continue with appropriate action to this end.11. The United Kingdom Government has in the last twelve months made considerable progress towards a sounder internal and external policy. The rapidimprovement in the balance-of-payments and the restoration of confidence in ster-ling result to some extent from temporary factors and the application of stringentimport restrictions. But they have been strongly helped by the general economicand financial policies of the Government, as follows- (a) the change in monetary policy and the tightening of credit;(b) the reduction of the overload on the economy, and measures to check thegrowth of Government expenditure;(c) the reduction of food subsidies, and the beginnings of decontrol measures designed to give greater play to the movement of prices and commercial considerations, instead of physical controls;(d) the first steps to reduce taxation and provide greater incentives.The Government intends to continue to move forward on these lines. It willguard against any return of inflationary conditions; it will seek to ensure thatunused resources are devoted either directly to export expansion or to the develop-ment of industrial capacity which will further strengthen our competitive power;it will seek to achieve an increase of production for the same ends. In the last twelve months, good progress has been made; but the United Kingdom Govern-ment recognises that this is only the beginning.12. The Commonwealth countries are going ahead so far as their resourcespermit with development schemes designed to increase their productive strengthand competitive power. It was agreed at the Conference that in the sterling area countries development should be concentrated on projects which directly or indirectly contribute to the improvement of the sterling area&apos;s balance-of-payments with the rest of the world. The United Kingdom Government has undertaken tomake a special effort to provide additional capital for Commonwealth developmentof a suitable kind, both by strengthening the facilities provided by the City ofLondon and by arrangements to make sterling available for lending by the Inter-national Bank. There is great need for capital throughout the Commonwealth, and sterling area Governments are fully conscious of the need to reduce existingobstacles -to United States and other foreign investment there.
13. These questions of internal policy are regarded by all Commonwealth.Governments as fundamental. The proposals for international policy outlined inthis Memorandum are put forward on the basis that sound internal policies will be successfully applied in the United Kingdom and other sterling commonwealth countries.(B) World Economic Balance14. A system of freer trade and currencies cannot be made to work effectivelyunless there is a general balance in the world economy. In particular, if there isa serious and continuing lack of balance between the United States and the restof the world all internal and international policies are likely to be frustrated.15. Since the beginning of the Marshall Plan, the rest of the world has hada current deficit with the United States averaging about $4 billions a year, in spiteof stringent restrictions in many countries against imports from the United States.This United States current surplus is little more than 1 per cent, of the UnitedStates gross national product. But it is over 30 per cent, of the rest of the workfsimports from the United States; and it is a formidable figure in relation to therest of the world&apos;s gold reserves (about $ 11 billions).16. The rest of the world has been enabled to finance this, deficit by UnitedStates Government grants of about $4 billions a year, and in addition there havebeen United States Government loans and private long-term investment of theorder of $1^ billions a year. Thus the United States has itself taken action on anunprecedentedly generous scale to restore the balance and to enable other countries to buy the United States goods which they needed either directly or by a processof multilateral trade.17. But the structure has rested on United States aid (and on restrictions on imports from the United States). This is not a sound or permanent basis for a healthy world economy. Moreover, experience has shown that the rest of theworld&apos;s current balance with the United States is subject to rapid and wide fiuctua-tions; within the last two years, the rest of the world&apos;s current deficit increased from a negligible amount in the first quarter of 1951 to an annual rate of nearly$6^ billions in the last quarter of 1951, falling again to negligible dimensions in thelatter part of 1952. These fluctuations, in a world in which gold reserves outsidethe United States are only about one-quarter of their pre-war level in relation tothe value of trade, are a profoundly disturbing influence.18. The United Kingdom Government firmly believes that the problem of&quot; world dollar shortage &quot; can be solved, provided that determined action is takenboth by the rest of the world and by the United States. However generous and far-sighted United States policy may be, it can be frustrated by inflation and failureof competitive power elsewhere. However vigorously the debtor countries tightenup their economies, their balance-of-payments problems will persist if the UnitedStates fails to pursue &quot; good creditor &quot; policies.19. The problem is two-sided; no satisfactory solution can be found either by the creditors or by the debtors alone. The debtor countries should adoptcontinuing policies to prevent inflation and to develop their competitive power inthe widest sense, while the United States should adopt policies which, both byhelping other countries to earn dollars and by long-term lending on Governmentand private account, will ensure that any current surplus in its balance-of-payments is at least covered by Governmental outgoings and private long-term investment.20. It is implicit in this Memorandum that combined action will be taken, bythe United States and by the rest of the world, to restore and maintain this necessarygeneral balance in the world economy. Otherwise the system of freer trade andcurrencies will either never come into being or will be swept away by crisis.III. Proposals for Freer Trade and Currencies(A) Summary21. Any plan for freeing and expanding world trade must cover both currenciesand trade. On the financial side, the objective is the convertibility of sterling and other currencies and the gradual removal of restrictions on payment. On thetrade side it is to bring about the removal of trade restrictions and discrimination
in a way which will encourage the expansion of world trade on an economic andhealthy basis. Progress must be made towards both objectives by stages; it willbe some considerable time before the objectives can be reached. The first aimmust be to create the conditions in which the process can begin.22. The proposals envisage collective action by the United States, theCommonwealth and Western Europe to secure the adoption of policies, by creditorand debtor countries, which will restore balance in the world economy on thelines of &quot; Trade, not Aid &quot; and will, by progressive stages and within reasonable time, create an effective multilateral trade and payments system covering the widest possible area.  The main elements are:  (a) Freer currencies: the provision of satisfactory conditions,  includingadequate financial support, for the convertibility of sterling and other important currencies.(b) Freer trade: the progressive removal of import restrictions and discrimina-tion by the debtor countries, together with action by the United states to improve other countries&apos; opportunities to earn dollars.(c) Development: the creation of conditions, both by creditor and by debtorcountries, which will foster adequate international investment and the sound and rapid development of the resources of the free world.(d) Organisation: the active and constructive use of international institutions(the International Monetary Fund (I.M.F.), the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) and the International Bank) to promotethese policies, and the provision of a forum where effective discussion of major economic policy can yield fruitful results.23. The United Kingdom Government regards these proposals as a compre-hensive whole; the speed of advance which is possible must be judged in the lightof the progress made under each of these heads.(B) Freer Currencies24. On the financial side, the convertibility of sterling is the most important part of the proposals. Nearly half the world&apos;s international business is conducted in sterling; sterling is the link between the dollar and the non-dollar economies. Itis on sterling that the pressures on the world economy tend to become concentrated,whether sterling is convertible or inconvertible. This is why it is so important,if sterling is successfully to become and remain convertible, for the world economy to be in reasonable balance and for the &quot; world dollar shortage &quot; to be overcome.25. In July .1947, in accordance with the terms of the Anglo-AmericanFinancial Agreement of December 1945, the United Kingdom Government madesterling convertible. The timing had been pre-determined far ahead; and in theevent the conditions were highly unfavourable. The United Kingdom. and thewhole sterling area were in very large balance-of-payments deficit with the restof the world; there was acute &quot;world dollar shortage&quot;; physical recovery in europe and Asia had hardly begun; there was a great hunger for goods and there were substantial amounts of sterling available throughout the world to buy them: Theoperation was disastrous, and within a few weeks convertibility had to be rescinded.This unhappy experience set back the prospect of freer trade and currencies formany years. The present situation is, of course, greatly different. But theexperience illustrates both the danger of premature action, and the danger of seekingand making commitments to carry out an operation of this nature at a specified time when the conditions then ruling cannot be known.26. It is the firm resolve of the United Kingdom Government, reinforced bythe Governments represented at the Commonwealth Economic Conference, to movetoward convertibility; indeed, a purpose of the present initiative is to create theconditions in which sterling can be made convertible. But the United KingdomGovernment must itself judge when the first step can be taken and what the natureof that step should be.27. A plan has been worked out, and was fully considered at the Common-wealth Economic Conference, for the first step towards convertibility. When this had been put into effect, it would be the intention,to move further forward by a gradual series of administrative relaxations; the pace of these relaxations would depend upon the success of the first step, and upon the progress made under allthe elements in the proposals.
28. Under this plan all sterling newly acquired by non-residents of the sterling area after the date of the operation would be made convertible at a dollar-sterlingrate which we should allow to move with more flexibility than at present. exchange control would continue to apply as at present to all transactions with non-residents of the sterling area by residents of the United Kingdom and of other sterling area countries.29. The effect would be that after a given day, all sterling accruing to individuals and institutions outside the sterling area-subject to whatever arrange-ments might be made about sterling which had been acquired previously-would be designated as &quot; External Sterling &quot; and would be freely exchanged in the market forgold or dollars or any other currency.30. Exchange Rare Policy.-lt is an integral part of the proposed operationthat there should be more flexibility in the exchange rate than is now the practice. It would not be possible to take such a major step towards conver-tibility in the reasonably near future and also to undertake to maintain a fixed ratewithin the presently permitted margin of 1 per cent.; to do this would requireexchange resources of a much greater size than there is any prospect of the UnitedKingdom acquiring, and a greater degree of political and economic stability in theworld than is likely to exist in the coming years. There would be no intention, aspart of the proposed operation, to change the present official parity. The objective of policy would be to maintain exchange rate stability, subject only to major trends in the sterling area&apos;s relationship with the rest of the world. The purpose would beto achieve sufficient flexibility to make the convertibility operation possible; andthe United Kingdom Government would make proposals to the international monetary Fund for this purpose.31. Financial Support. The United Kingdom^ gold and dollar reserves are inadequate to support a convertibility operation of this scale without the risk ofsuch great fluctuations in the exchange rate as would frustrate the purpose of theoperation. At the end of January 1953, the reserves were slightly below $2,000millions-equivalent to about four weeks&apos; turnover of the sterling area&apos;s transactions with the rest of the world. Some indication of the inadequacy of these reserves isshown by the fact that they are only one-twelfth of those of the United States,although the sterling area&apos;s transactions with the rest of the world are of much thesame size as those of the United States. In recent years, there have been largeswings in the sterling area&apos;s gold and dollar surplus and deficit; the differencebetween the quarterly rate of surplus or deficit between the top and the bottom ofthe swing has usually been over $1 billion. Swings are inevitable as the world economy fluctuates, and although it may legitimately be hoped that these will be lessin future than they have been in recent years, their scale will certainly be far greaterthan could be accommodated by the present reserves. Unless the reserves werestrengthened, there would be great danger of acute exchange rate instability.32. Consequently, it would be essential to obtain sufficient financial support for the operation. This is not required to fill continuing balance-of-paymentsdeficits; the sterling area is currently in balance with the rest of the world, and hopesto remain so.   Financial support would be needed:  (i) to deal with short-term fluctuations;(ii) to deal with any pressures, which might arise to convert existing sterling balances held by non-residents; these are not generally in excess of minimum working balances, but a risk would arise;(hi) above all, to provide confidence that the United Kingdom has adequate reserves at its disposal to protect sterling and thus, if there were an adverse change in the situation, to maintain a reasonable degree ofexchange rate stability while remedial measures were being taken.It follows from the nature of these needs that support funds would have to beavailable to the United Kingdom for unquestioned use when they are wanted.33; It is the United Kingdonrs view (explained more fully in paragraphs 53to 58) that it is right to work through the existing international institutions, fortheir purpose has always been to free trade and currencies. The United kingdom would therefore seek financial support from the I.M.F. as a &quot;stand-by&quot; credit,to be drawn on as required, for an agreed period of not less than twelve months,with agreed provision for extension thereafter.  The present unexhausted balance
of the United kingdom&apos;s normal drawing rights in the I.M.F. ($1-3 billions) wouldnot, however, be sufficient for.this purpose. It is difficult to see how this difficulty would be overcome unless the United States Government could provide additional funds to enable the I.M.F. to give a sufficiently larger &quot; stand-by &quot; credit. Theseproposals do not imply any change in the present rights of other members of the sterling area to draw on the Fund.34. European Currencies. The United Kingdom Government intends to initiate discussions with the Governments of France, Benelux, Germany, Italy,Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries in order to seek their support for the objectives of these proposals, and to see how the plan could best be developed to sustain the economies of Western Europe. The move towards convertibility wouldhave important repercussions on the European economy for example, it would end the European Payments Union (E.P.U.). in its present form and the tradeimplications would also be important. The United Kingdom Government would,of course, maintain its full support of the E.P.U. while the proposed new systemof freei trade and currencies was being planned.35. The United Kingdom hopes that the leading European countries would enter fully into the new system and would make their currencies convertible at thesame time as sterling. These countries might well wish to secure financial support from the I.M.F. on similar lines to those suggested for the United Kingdom. Itwould naturally be for the European countries to decide their own exchange ratepolicy. It would, however, be the United Kingdom&apos;s objective to evolve working arrangements with them which would secure exchange stability in Europe and sofacilitate intra-European co-operation both in trade and in finance.36. Subsequent Action. If the convertibility operation had been successful,the next step would be a gradual easing of exchange restrictions. The operation would have removed all limitations on the use of newly-acquired sterling by non-residents of the sterling area; thereafter there would be a gradual process of removing the limitations on transfers of sterling by residents to non-residents. It isimpossible to say in advance how fast it would be possible to move; but the more successful the general measures to bring about world economic balance, the betterwould be the prospect of advance.(C) Freer Trade37. It is essential that the major trading countries should adopt trading poli-cies which are conducive to trade expansion. This is so whether convertibility beachieved or not. Convertibility is not an end in itself, but a means to economic expansion. But it must be recognised also that in the absence of such trade policies,the risks of a convertibility operation, would be greatly increased. The main danger to the United Kingdom in making sterling convertible is that other countries, short of dollars, would restrict their imports from the sterling area in order to save&quot;external sterling &quot; and thus shift their deficits with the dollar area on to us. TheUnited Kingdom would be forced to restrict its imports in reply, and the result would be a world-wide intensification of import.and exchange restrictions and adescending spiral of world trade.38. This danger is implicit in convertibility, but the United,Kingdom Govern-ment believes that it could be greatly reduced if effective action were taken, first to secure international agreement to the progressive removal of import restrictions,and, equally important, to mitigate, the ...&quot; world dollar shortage &quot;-so that othercountries would not have so strong an incentive to earn dollars at the expense ofthe United Kingdom and of each other.39. Removal of Import Restrictions. There have now been several years&apos;experience in the G.A.T.T. and in the O.E.E.C. of the problem of removing import restrictions, and it is proposed that a new attempt should be made to make effectiveprogress in the light of this experience. It is not proposed to seek at this stage to write new rules governing the use of import restrictions. Some revision of theexisting Articles in the G.A.T.T. on the use of quantitative restrictions for balance-of-payments purposes will become necessary in due course; the criteria relatingto &quot; balance-of-payments difficulties &quot;will in any event have to be reconsidered ifa greater element.of flexibility is injected into exchange rate,policy. It would be premature, however, to ,write. new rules, before, there has been some experience ofthe working.of convertibility with flexible exchange rates, ./40. The United Kingdom Government considers that the best procedure isto secure agreement on long-term policy between the United States, the United
Kingdom (in consultation with other members of the Commonwealth) and theleading European countries, and to work towards this in the various international institutions. It would be the intention to review the rules of the G.A.T.T., andto revise them, where this was necessary, after a reasonable period say, one year had elapsed from the time of the first convertibility operation. In the intervening period between the convertibility operation and the introduction of revised traderules, the countries concerned would agree to adopt policies consistent with the objectives. This is the procedure which, in the United Kingdom Government^view, would make possible the most rapid advance.41. Long-term Policy. It is suggested that the agreement on long-term policy might take the following form, which is a development of the principles of theG.A.T.T. in the light of experience. The agreement would provide for four points:id) Determined international action:  (i) to remove quantitative restrictions (except as provided below);(ii) to assure the progessive removal of discrimination in step withthe progressive solution of the world dollar problem.(b) Provision that the speed of removal of restrictions would not necessarily be the same for all countries; for example, certain under-developed countries may need freedom for some time to come to enable them touse their limited exchange resources in a manner calculated to implement their development programmes.(c) Recognition that the solution of balance-of-payments problems may require action both by creditors and by debtors, and that the traderules should be framed accordingly.id) Recognition of the need to concentrate international consideration uponconstructive remedies.42.&apos; It is not practicable, or indeed desirable, to bring about a world-wideremoval of restrictions at one stroke. There must be provision for the retentionof restrictions, or their re-imposition, when circumstances warrant it. But therules should provide that countries retaining quantitative restrictions must justifythem on the special grounds (such as economic development, &amp;c.) specificallyprovided for in the G.A.T.T. and could apply them otherwise only under aninternationally accepted escape clause. This would cover both emergencies for individual countries arising from their own balance-of-payments difficulties and world-wide emergencies arising from general imbalance. It would be providedthat countries invoking the escape clause must justify their use of it in an inter-national forum and that where it is justified positive remedies must be soughtboth by the country imposing the restrictions and by other countries. A similar procedure would be adopted if one country was in large and persistent surplus which was forcing other countries into balance-of-payments difficulties. Theworking of the escape clause would have to be supervised through some jointmechanism of the I.M.F. and the G.A.T.T., for experience has shown, both there and in the O.E.E.C., that the financial and trade aspects of balance-of-paymentsemergencies cannot be separated. ...43. The procedure would therefore be to intensify the pressure through inter-national institutions to get rid of quantitative restrictions, conducting this in a realistic and constructive manner by trying to find practical solutions to countries&apos;balance-of-payments problems, both by internal and by international action.44. Policies in the Intervening Period. In the initial period after converti-bility before the new trade rules had been formulated in detail, all countries participating in the approach to convertibility would agree to move towards the agreed objectives as fast as they could. The United Kingdom&apos;s policy would beto remove restrictions and discrimination as fast as was compatible with avoidingsignificant additional strain on the sterling area&apos;s balance-of-payments with therest of the world in this critical first period of convertibility. It would serve no useful purpose for anybody if the United Kingdom dismantled import controlsso rapidly that there was great pressure on the exchange rate in the early stages ofconvertibility leading to instability and loss of confidence in sterling.45. However, the United Kingdom would hope to make significant progresswithin the first year. The United Kingdom&apos;s general principles in this initial period after the first convertibility operation would be to move to non-discrimina-tion or in some cases complete removal of import restrictions on more essential goods, and to a further liberalisation in the O.E.E.C. (if others did the same) on
other goods. Thus the United Kingdom would seek to maintain the liberalisation of intra-European trade, and would be ready to play its part in this process; inessential raw materials and staple foods it would hope to extend the policy of buying on the most favourable commercial terms- this would mean workingtowards world open general licences in some suitable cases and to non-sterlingglobal quotas in others.46. In the period before convertibility, the United Kingdom hopes tocontinue to move in this direction. In recent months, a number of significantsteps have been taken for example, the introduction of world open- licences for the import of softwood, lead and zinc, modifications in the Ministry of Food&apos;sbuying policy to provide greater freedom to buy in the cheapest market, and anincrease in certain global quotas for imports from Europe. It is hoped that thissteady advance will continue, but it would be dangerous to move too fast inremoval of trade restrictions in the period before convertibility, for the gold reserves are much too low to permit risks to be taken without the element of flexibility in exchange rate policy and the financial support which are an integral part of the convertibility proposals. If the United Kingdom took risks at thisstage, it would endanger the whole prospect of convertibility, for if there was an adverse turn in events, the gold reserves would be rapidly depleted and a sterlingcrisis would threaten.47. Opportunities to Earn Dollars. It is unlikely to be possible to securerapid progress towards the world-wide removal of quantitative restrictions anddiscrimination unless there are better opportunities for earning United Statesdollars. This is partly for economic reasons, as the essential basis for continueddiscrimination against United States exports is the lack of dollars to pay for them.But psychological considerations are also involved, for there is a widespread fear that United States policies may be inconsistent with the creditor position of theUnited States and with the policies of freer trade and currencies which the UnitedStates has for many years advocated. It is not questioned that United States policy has been greatly modified in the last twenty years. But it is certainly true to saythat nothing would be more conducive to the adoption of freer trade and currencypolicies by other countries than a real step forward by the United States to helpother countries to live by &quot; Trade, not Aid.&quot;48. The particular policies which could be changed to provide greater opportunities to earn and save dollars have been extensively explored in recentyears tariff policy and customs procedure, the use of quota restrictions to protectagriculture, &quot; Buy American &quot; legislation, shipping discrimination and subsidies,immigration, &quot; tied &quot; lending (e.g., by the Export-Import Bank), &amp;c. It is not forthe United Kingdom to suggest specific action to the United States in any of these directions the difficulties are well known. But it would be less than realisticfor the United Kingdom Government to refrain from saying that the adoption ofthe proposals in this Memorandum would involve the United Kingdom and many other countries in serious and dangerous risks, which can be mitigated but noteliminated by international action, and that if the proposals are to be translated into action, public opinion outside the United States will expect to see concreteevidence that the United States itself is making adjustments in its commercial policy to help other countries to make the adjustments which are admittedlyrequired in theirs. The proposals cannot be expected to succeed unless the UnitedStates is able to make definite progress and is seen making this progress-in a constructive direction.(D) Development49. A system of freer trade and currencies provides the framework for, but does not itself ensure, the world-wide expansion of production and trade. It isthe, United Kingdom Governments view that over the next decade a great partcan be played, both in bringing about economic expansion and in the creation ofpolitical stability, by the rapid development of the economic resources of the free world.50. The central problems are those of organisation and the provision ofcapital. In the Colombo Plan, and in the continuous discussion of these problems in recent years in the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth countries have made
considerable progress towards an understanding on these matters. It is recognisedthat investment must be concentrated where it increases economic strength, thatit must be carried out in a manner which avoids the danger of inflation, and thatit is the responsibility of the countries which wish to import capital for develop-ment to create the conditions which would encourage such investment. For its part, the United Kingdom is determined to do all it can to generate a sufficientflow of savings to enable the flow of capital from London for sound developmentthroughout the Commonwealth to be maintained and increased.51. . It is hoped that the United States will find itself able, by government loans, private investment and through the International Bank, to find useful andprofitable opportunities to participate in Commonwealth development. Neitherthe United Kingdom Government nor the Governments represented at theCommonwealth Economic Conference have any specific proposal to make to theUnited States Government at this time. But it is hoped that our. proposals forfreer trade and currencies will create conditions favouring a greater flow of UnitedStates Governmental and private capital to the sterling area commonwealth countries.52. It is the United Kingdom&apos;s intention to regain its traditional role as anexporter of capital; the recent decision to release sterling for lending by the Inter-national Bank is an indication both of this intention and of the importance whichthe United Kingdom Government attaches to the development of the international bank as a channel for international investment. It is hoped that the United states will place increasing resources at the International Bank&apos;s disposal. It is the UnitedKingdom&apos;s view that a substantially increased flow of international investment would be of great constructive value, not only to the countries receiving this invest-ment, but also for the world economy generally. The creation of this flow of capitaldepends greatly upon the ability of the debtors to show that the conditions forsound investment exist, but it seems unlikely that the existing financial and invest-ment machinery in the United States will alone provide facilities for overseasborrowers on the scale which the opportunities for sound investment are likely tojustify.(E) Organisation53. The proposals outlined in this Memorandum for creating conditions forfreer trade and currencies could not be carried out without considerable inter-national negotiation and continuing co-operation. After the exploratory discus-sions between the United States and United Kingdom Governments, and betweenthe United Kingdom and the leading European Governments, and after further consultation with other Commonwealth Governments, there would have to be a process of detailed negotiation to provide an agreed programme of action.54. In the United Kingdom Governments view and this is also the view ofthe other Commonwealth Governments it would be right to work through theexisting international institutions, when once agreement has been reached betweenthe United States, the Commonwealth and Western Europe. The purpose of theI.M.F. and the G.A.T.T. was to establish and promote a system of freer trade andcurrencies, and there can be no question of superseding them. For this reason,it is proposed that the financial support should be arranged through the I.M.F. andthe G.A.T.T. would of course be in the centre of the operations on trade restrictions.55. These institutions cannot work effectively, however, unless the moreimportant members are in agreement, and they also have at present the serious disadvantage that they provide no forum in which the inter-related problems offinance and trade can be discussed together and a view can be taken on international economic policy as a whole.56.. This might be remedied by setting up an Advisory Group, which wouldprovide a continuing forum where the world economic situation would be kept under review and constructively discussed and general principles could be worked out on the problems arising in the movement towards freer trade and currencies.This Advisory Group, as the United Kingdom sees it, would have no operationalfunctions, although both theT.M.F. and theG.A.T.T. might refer to it any question on which they desired guidance; its function would be to make recommendations,and not to exercise executive authority.
.57. The Advisory Group eould consist of representatives of Governments,but the Managing Director of the I.M.F. and an appropriate representative of theG.A.T.T. could be ex offxcio members. It would be premature to lay down indetail how the Group should be constituted in detail, but there might be a few&quot;permanent&quot; members-e.g., the United States, the United Kingdom and alarger number of members appointed in rotation from countries which are membersof the I.M.F. and the G.A.T.T. in a manner which would ensure that at all times the main trading and monetary areas of the world were appropriately represented.Countries participating in the initial negotiations for freer trade and currencieswould clearly have to be in a large majority. The representatives of governments should be senior officials closely concerned with the administration of external economic policy in their capitals with deputies to carry on when continuous work was required.58. The two essentials in organisation would be the provision of a forum for discussion of major economic policy, and the linking together of finance andtrade.(F) A Related Matter outside the Proposals59. Tariff Preferences. The United Kingdom Government will wish todiscuss with the United States Government a point about preferences. The UnitedKingdom Government is faced with serious difficulties arising from the combined effect of the &quot; no new preference &quot; rule of the G.A.T.T. and its traditional policyof exempting Commonwealth goods from its protective tariff. Without departing from this policy, which would be contrary to existing legislation, the UnitedKingdom is denied the freedom which all countries enjoy to raise duties (unlessspecifically bound against increase) where this may be judged necessary to giveincreased protection to domestic producers. It is therefore the intention of theUnited Kingdom Government to approach the other contracting parties to theG.A.T.T. in order to secure an appropriate facility, consistent with the basic pro-visions of the G.A.T.T., to increase protective duties as and when this may fromtime to time be necessary, without impairing continued exemption of Common-wealth goods from duty. The United Kingdom Government considers that thebest arrangement would probably be an agreed interpretation of the relevant article of the G.A.T.T. in the sense that, where a country increases a most-favoured-nationrate of duty solely in order to protect a domestic industry, that article shall notbe applied so as to oblige the country to abandon duty-free treatment for the goodsin question under its preferential tariff.IV. Conclusion60. In this Memorandum the United Kingdom Government has set out itstentative proposals in considerable detail, for it is only in terms of detail that discussion of this series of subjects can lead to effective action. The whole of theseproposals is subject to discussion, and the United Kingdom will not itself decide what course of action it should adopt until it becomes clear whether an acceptableinternational plan can be worked out.61. The United Kingdom Government commends the proposals in thisMemorandum to the urgent and earnest consideration of the United States Govern-ment. The underlying principle, like the principle underlying our military co-operation-operation, is that if each country plays its part our common objectives can beachieved. The United Kingdom&apos;s part, as we see it, is first and foremost to carryout internal policies which will enable it to strengthen its economy and competitive power and to pay its way; and second, by making sterling convertible at theappropriate time, to provide the link by which a world-wide system of freer tradeand currencies can come into being and provide the framework for economic expansion throughout the free world. The United Kingdom Government believes that in the last twelve months the United Kingdom has made substantial and lastingprogress towards enabling itself to play its part fully and well.62. The United Kingdom Government is supported in this initiative by the.whole of the Commonwealth and its 600 million people doing nearly one-third of
the world&apos;s international trade. It intends, as soon as the first explanatory discussions with the United States are completed, to seek the support of the leadingWestern European countries. The United Kingdom Government believes that,with the support of the United States, a satisfactory basis can be found for an advance, within reasonable time, to freer trade and currencies. In this the UnitedKingdom Government sees a sound foundation for continuing a closer co-operationbetween the United States, the Commonwealth and Western Europe, and a steadygrowth of the economic strength of the entire free world, which is the indispensablebasis for our security and freedom.
