(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)-secret. (53). 80. COPY NOL28th FEBRUARY, 1953.CABINETEAST WEST TRADEPROPOSALS FOR TIGHTENING UP CONTROL OVERSHIPPING ENGAGED IN THE CARRIAGE of strategic GOODS TO CHINA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State forCo-ordination of Transports Fuel and Power.Since I was invited to submit this paper to the Cabinet, the foreign secretary has given us examples of the anomalies which are giving rise to criticismin the United States.   I deal with these below.SHIPPING CONTROL(a) A few British ships have been carrying strategic cargoes to Chinaof non-British origin from non-British ports2. I understand that out of 173 voyages by non-Communist vessels:to China in 1952 from areas other than Hong Kong or the Soviet Far East, three british and nine other non-Communist ships carried among their mixed cargoesitems on the strategic list, including some lorries, iron and steel rails, andrubber tyres.   There is at present no law or Government direction prohibiting the employment of British ships in this way.3. When the Cabinet considered this problem in January 1952, ministers decided that no action should be taken by the United Kingdom to prohibit british ships taking part in such traffics unless other nations imposed similar controls.(C.C.(52) 2nd Conclusions, Minute 3).4. I believe that action on these lines would be the best way of achievingwhat both we and the Americans are after, namely, the prohibition by as many people as possible on the movement of strategic goods to China, but I understandthat it is now unlikely that such a gesture, conditional as it is upon the agreementof the other members of the United Nations, would give the Foreign Secretarysufficient for his purpose, and to enable the Foreign Secretary to make a readyresponse to American representations on this subject, I am now prepared to agreethat the United Kingdom should inform the United States of their readiness toapply control unilaterally, and invite their co-operation in persuading the other powers to take similar action.5. The prohibition of the carriage of strategic goods by United Kingdomships can be brought into effect rapidly by means of an Order under defence regulation 46, which would provide that no British ship registered in the United-1-
a?Kingdom or Colonies can put to sea on a voyage to China without a licence fromthe Ministry of Transport, and this would provide that the ship shouldnot carry goods on a specified list and make it an offence if the Master knowinglydid soe   A short list of prohibited goods, which could be readily identified bythe Master on loading, has been prepared, and, subject to the agreement of theother Departments concerned, could be used for this purpose.6. No new legislation would be required in the United Kingdom, but wouldprobably be necessary in certain Colonies to enable them to take proceedings againstOwners and Masters of ships domiciled there.   Action to bring the Order under defence Regulation 46 into force in the United Kingdom and Colonies need not be delayed pending the introduction of legislation elsewhere.BUNKER CONTROL(b) ships carrying strategic goods to China can be bunkered at some 3ritish ports;(c) Polish ships with strategic cargoes for China can be bunkered by british companies at non-British ports.7.   The major British oil companies have bunker stations all over the world,and can do business without government restrictions with the shipowners of anyflag.8. Ministers agreed that the refusal of port services, including bunkers,to ships trading with China should only be considered where the cargoes were of high strategic importance;  each case was to be dealt with ad hoc by administrativemeans.   So long as oil supplies were short the oil companies were able in manycases to withhold supplies on commercial grounds.   Now that supplies are more plentiful, bunkers can be refused by the British companies, where they holdcontracts, only if Her Majesty&apos;s Government expressly request the companies todo so.   Such instructions have only been given in two or three cases.   The UnitedStates are dissatisfied with what we are doing and have threatened to stop suppliesof oil to our own oil companies unless we introduce a scheme of control.9. It is clearly dangerous for us, as the leading maritime and a major oilpower, to instruct our companies to withhold bunkers from foreign ships, and anycontrol we exercise must be with the greatest care. Our shipping is particularlyvulnerable to retaliation in kind from other unfriendly countries, and our protestsagainst the behaviors of others, e. g. Egypt, are weakened by a too hasty resort tosuch measures.10; However, I see no objection to giving British oil companies instructionsnot to bunker certain ships provided that:(a) we confine this control to ships engaged in the carriage of strategic goods;(b) the list of strategic goods is sufficiently limited to make theoperation of control practicable and reasonable.   I suggest that the list proposed for the control over ships would serve;(c) the action is not taken except with the full knowledge and, ifpossible, the agreement, first, of the other friendly maritime powerswhose ships may be affected (this would not embarrass them if theyapplied control to their ships);  secondly, of the countries like Ceylon,Indonesia and others where British bunker depots are.   The co-operationof these latter governments is indispensible, since they would otherwise
be in a position to frustrate requests made by her Majesty&apos;s Government to the oil companies holdingstocks in their territory, and might even go so far asto requisition these stocks if the local subsidiaries oragents of the British companies were not compliant.In the case of the &quot;Pulaski&quot;, a Polish ship carryingstrategic goods to China, Her Majesty&apos;s governments request to the British oil company to refuse oil atDjakarta in Indonesia was frustrated by the action of thelocal government.11. I recommend therefore that the Foreign Secretary shouldbe authorised, at his discretion, to inform the United States Government that her majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to request the British oil companies to refuseto supply bunkers to ships known to be carrying strategic goods to China onthe understanding that our two governments should jointly take steps, nsecure the consent of the other maritime countries and also the countries wherethe oil companies have depots.12. I understand that a practicable scheme can be worked out for notifying the oil companies of the ships to whom they must refuse bunkers,but it must be recognised that no scheme of bunker control could be so water-tightas to prevent every ship carrying strategic cargo from getting through.   It willbe necessary to work out similar arrangements for the control of coalbunkering.STORING OF SHIPS(d)  a Finnish oil tanker with aviation spirit for China can pick up stores in Hong Kong.,13. While, in principle, the storing, watering and repairing of ships carrying strategic goods may have some of the objectionablefeatures of bunkering, the position is different in that the services are notcontrolled by any centralised concern, such as the major oil companies.   We haveno influence whatever over the providers of these services in foreign and Common-wealth...countries, and, so far as is known, no powers in the Colonies.   The most i could suggest - and this is more a matter for the Secretary of State for theColonies than myself - is that a flagrant case should be dealt with by whateveradministrative means are at hand, but we should not commit ourselves to anyparticular line of policy.       If we go as far as I have recommended in regard tocontrol of ships&apos; voyages and bunkers, I consider that we can safely ignore thisminor question.REGISTRATION OF SHIPS(e) ships can acquire British Registry in Hong Kong though their operation is entirely in the Communist interest.14. The United States authorities have referred to the factthat Communist interests are taking advantage of registration in Hong Kong to securethe protection of the British flag, although the ships and the companies concerned are operating entirely for the benefit of China,15, There is no evidence that any ships registered in Hong Konghave carried strategic goods into China, but the fact that these ships are on the hong Kong Register is an advantage rather than a disadvantage in presentcircumstances, seeing that they remain under British control, and, when controlof ships&apos; voyages in the trade to China is introduced, these ships will, like any
miother ships on the United Kingdom and Colonial Registers,be required to get a licence and be prohibited from carrying strategic cargo.After that, unless they continue to operate solely in legitimate trades, theirowners and masters will be liable to prosecutions, and, by reason of thefact that they are on the British Register, it would be within our power in extreme circumstances;to requisition the ships.16. Apart from this, we have no powers to expel such shipswhatever their trade from the British,Register.   To do this would require an amendment of a fundamental principle of the Merchant Shipping Acts,under which a British national or company owning a ship is required to register that ship in the United Kingdom or Colonies.17. Further, it is the policy of Her Majesty&apos;s Government torefuse the transfer of ships to potential enemies and to take powers to expel ships from the Register would be playing right into their hands.18. A special problem arises frcm the fact that so long asthey fly the British flag they are entitled to the protection of the Royal Navywhere that is available, and it v/ould doubtless be embarrassing both in the UniteStates and in this country if the Navy were required to protect a ship whichwas operated entirely in the interests of Communi. t China from interferencefrom Nationalist naval forces,.    It is clearly desirable to avoidsuch a situation, and perhaps the best solution might be for the Commander-in-Chief, Far East, if he considers   this necessary, to advise British owners to avoid the Formosan Straits.SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS19. To enable the Foreign Secretary to promise further measures againsttraffic in prohibited goods, if he considers this essential, I suggest that heshould be authorised:(a) to offer to prohibit the carriage of strategic goods in UnitedKingdom and Colonial ships, and to join with the UnitedStates in persuading the other maritime countries to followsuit.(b) to request the British bunkering companies to refuse bunkersto ships carrying strategic cargoes on the understanding thatthe United States join with the United Kingdom in securing,as far as possible, the consent of the foreign and Common-wealth countries whose ships may be affected, as well asthose where stocks are held.(a) to withhold stores (other than bunkers), water or repairsfrom any ship;  or(b) to take measures other than those proposed at 19(a) aboveagainst ships on the British register believed to be underthe beneficial ownership or control of Communist interests.20. I consider that no commitment should be made:21.or desirableThe First Lord will wish to consider whether it is necessaryto warn British vessels to avoid the Straits of Formosa.Great George Street, S.W.I.28th February, 1953.
