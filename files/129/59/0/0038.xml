(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret. (53) 88 COPY NO.6th MARCH., 1953.CABINETSTERLING AREA TRADE WITH JAPAN IN 1953.Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth relations the Economic Policy Committee have held several meetings on the difficult and urgent problem of the Sterling Area&apos;s trade relations with Japan.We must now decide the policy which we are to follow in the United Kingdomand the Colonies and the advice which we should give to the independent countries in the Sterling Area.   The attached report sets out the facts, uponwhich we are all agreed, and the conclusions to which the majority of theCommittee have come.   But the issues involved are so far-reaching and involve such important consequences, both for domestic politics and for international relations, that we must give the Cabinet the opportunity toconsider and decide the policy to be adopted.The majority of the Committee recommend the Cabinet to approve theaction proposed in our report.SWINTONCommonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1.6th March, 1953.REPORT BY THE ECONOMIC POLICY COMMITTEE1. We have recently extended the Sterling Payments Agreement with japan until December 1953.   Under the terms of this Agreement both sides are committed to taking all reasonable steps to prevent or correct a chronicimbalance in payments in either direction.   This position has now arisen.Japan&apos;s sterling balances have for some time been falling rapidly and arenow expected to reach a level below  55 millions by the end of March.   This isthe minimum amount which Japan thinks it necessary to hold at any one time.Whether, as some of the Committee think, the Japanese overestimate the mini-mum sum which     they need to hold, there is no doubt that, unless remedial action is taken by allowing a large increase in Japanese exports to the sterling Area, Japanese sterling balances will fall far below a figure which thewhole Committee would accept as a minimum, and the Japanese will be unableto restore the position by the end of the year.
2. If we do nothing to correct this imbalance, therefore, Japan will in the very near future impose restrictions on imports from the sterling area, notably from the independent sterling Commonwealth countries from whom she buys a large part of her raw materials.   We shall be accused of a breach of the Sterling Payments Agreement;  and the continuation of our import restrictions, when no justification on balance of payments groundsexists, will be taken as evidence that we are using those restrictions to protect british industry.   We should also be open to criticism in the United states on the ground that we were pursuing a line inconsistent with the general policies which we are advocating.3. On the other hand, any large relaxation of restrictions on Japaneseimports into the Sterling Area would be hard to defend politically, both in thiscountry and, perhaps, in Europe.   It would be difficult to permit the import of Japanese textiles at a moment when the President of the Board of Trade has just reached an agreement with the Lancashire textile industry to increase its output of cheap cloth in order to compete with Japanese products.   european countries would find it difficult to understand concessions to the Japanesebefore the statement in the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation on 23rd March of our intentions with regard to European trade.4, The Committee have discussed this problem in all its aspects andare satisfied that it is in the interests of the Sterling Area as a whole thatwe should continue to try to maintain a balance of trade between the sterling area and Japan at a high level and to induce the Japanese to conduct the major part of their trade in sterling, which is the basis of our existing agreementwith Japan.5. The maximum of concessions which the majority of the committee feel it would be politically possible to offer are as follows:-(a) That the Colonies should be permitted in 1953 to import forretention about 20 per cent more than the annual rate during the second half of 1952, as evidenced by payments during that period;  this might yield a total increase of about  6 millions in the value of.Japanese imports to the Colonies in 1953.   The President of theBoard of Trade considers that this is the furthest that the colonies should be invited to go;  and the majority of the Committee agree.(b) That imports into Hong Kong and Singapore for re-export outside the sterling Area should be licensed freely, subject to present strategic controls on trade with Communist China, and to any extension ofthese found to be necessary;  we estimate that this might yield anadditional  8=10 millions in 1953.6. We should also keep the independent Sterling Area informed of therelaxations we propose to offer and of the course of the negotiations, and it ispossible that as a result, Pakistan and Burma, for example, may increase their purchases from Japan.   In telling Australia and New Zealand, however, themajority of the Committee consider that it would be essential to express astrong hope that, in our interest, they would not relax their present restrictions on Japan.   If the independent Sterling Area, with the exception ofAustralia and New Zealand, were to liberalise to the same extent as theColonies would be invited to, Japanese sterling earnings might be increasedby a further  4 -6 millions, provided that the Japanese could maintain their sterling purchases.
7.        These concessions might therefore increase Japanese earnings bysomething between  18 millions and  22 millions and might provide a basis for further negotiations.   The majority of the Committee would not go further than this.   &quot;We cannot give any undertaking to offer anything substantialon the part of the United Kingdom, particularly so far as textiles are concerned for the reasons given in paragraph 3;  and it would be politically very difficultto ask Australia and New Zealand to relax the restrictions on the entry of japanese goods which they have just re-imposed.8. This is the maximum offer that the majority of the Committee thinkit is politically possible to make and it is improbable that the total would besufficient to prevent Japan having to put restrictions on imports of goods from the sterling Area.   It can therefore be argued that the offer is not worth making at all0Nevertheless the Committee are of the opinion that it is desirable to make this offer since otherwise we should be making no attempt to fulfil the SterlingPayments Agreement, fresh Japanese restrictions on sterling imports wouldbe a certainty and the political effects on opinion in the United States and incertain of the other Commonwealth countries might well be serious,9. The majority of the Committee also feel that we should have to make our offer contingent upon a Japanese undertaking to refrain from imposingfurther restrictions upon imports from the Sterling Area at the present time,10. If the Japanese retort that these concessions are not enough toenable them to maintain their sterling imports, our representatives should be instructed to point out that we are making a substantial contribution and thatif the Japanese want to go further they must help themselves by acceptingsterling more readily from third countries.Conclusions11. The majority of the Committee consider that the proposals set out inparagraphs 5 and 6 are as far as we can go and should be contingent upon theundertaking by Japan, referred to in paragraph 9 not to impose further restrictions on imports from the Sterling Area at the present time.   they accordingly ask the Cabinet to agree that we should enter upon negotiations onthis basis.12. A minority, however, consider that nothing less than a 20 per cent increase in the total level of Sterling Area imports can prevent the Japanesefrom imposing restrictions forthwith, and even this is doubtful.   If the UnitedKingdom, Australia and New Zealand are to be excluded, the relaxationsin the Colonies must therefore be proportionately increased.13. In view of the present serious drain on Japanese sterling balances,the trend of which in recent months is shown in the Annex,a decision is urgent, and the Cabinet are asked to decide which of these two alternatives should be pursued.
