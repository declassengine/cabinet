(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET(1C.(53) 81 COPY NO.2nd MARCH, 1953.cabinet trade WITH china memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade,I am circulating this memorandum on our trade with China, and therestrictions we impose on it, as requested by Cabinet at the meeting on26th February (C.C.(53) 15th Conclusions, Minute 10).2. We have a very good case to present.   We are scrupulouslyconfining our exports to non-strategic goods; and we have moved further andfaster than any other country in Western Europe in carrying out strictlythe obligations we have all accepted under the United Nations Resolution.Thus, we have for some time now controlled severely our exports of certainloharmaceutical goods although other European countries have continued to release them freely.   We are ahead of other countries in that we prohibit theexport of various goods such as small diesel engines and iron and steel products whereas other European countries regard them as non-strategic andtherefore do not restrict supplies.   Moreover, we not only restrict trade inBritish goods by export control, but we have also introduced trans-shipmentcontrols over all the most important items to prevent other countries from sending these goods to China through our ports.3. We have been strongly criticised in Parliament and elsewhere,and we have been hard put to it to explain why we go further in these waysthan other countries in Western Europe.   To the extent that other countries inEurope allow their traders to sell these goods to China, the effect of ourcontrols is not to de&apos;ny the goods to China but to divert the trade from ourmerchants to merchants on the Continent.   Similarly, as regards trans-shipment,which in most Continental ports is not subject to any control, we are simplydriving trans-shipment business to those ports from our own.4, We are doing all we can in the Paris Group to bring other countriesinto line with ourselves.   We have stated our readiness to examine thepossibility of introducing additional controls such as would prevent ourtraders from supplying strategic goods to China even though these goodswould not pass through this country.   But we have emphasised that it is an indispensable condition that other countries should take satisfactory andcomparable action and that our difficulties are severely exacerbated by thefailure  of ether countries to extend their controls to the same list as our own.5. I think we should be ready to tighten our controls in any and everyway necessary to prevent our traders from supplying strategic goods to China.But I see no point in doing this so long as other countries allow their tradersto handle the business, and I think we should stipulate as a clear condition that all the other countries concerned must apply corresponding controls to allthe goods that we control.   If the Americans are ready to apply pressure tobring about a single common policy of this kind, we should be prepared to backthem unreservedly and to play our full part.
6. The Americans may wish not only to do this but to try to extend the range of trade to be controlled or even to introduce a complete embargo on all trade v/ith China.   At present our total exports to China are about 5 millions and our imports in return about  3 millions.   This is usefultrade and the exports do not help the Chinese in their military operations.But if the Americans felt strongly that a complete embargo should beintroduced and all the other countries concerned were willing to apply such an embargo, provided we came into line, I should not on purely trade grounds regard it as vital to preserve this trade, though the extension of the embargo to non-strategic goods would be a reversal of our present policy.7. The United Kingdom trade involved, however, is only one factor;there are other and more serious consequences to be taken into account.An embargo on trade with China would weaken our power to resist Americanpressure for a similar embargo on exports to the Soviet bloc;  these we want to maintain in order to secure essential supplies in return.   More over, andeven more important, a complete embargo against China would cripple HongKong economically and so produce internal conditions in which the CentralPeoples Government could foster serious unrest among the predominantlyChinese population; this might be a prelude to the Chinese taking military .measures against Hong Kong.   Any proposal to extend the range of trade tobe covered by our controls would therefore call for very careful scrutiny.8. For these reasons I hope that the Americans will not ask us toextend our controls to the non-strategic goods still licensed; and that, if theydo, we shall be able to dissuade them from pressing us.   In this connection it may be useful to point out that we have just advised the Federation ofBritish Industries, Chambers of Commerce and interested firms that weshould prefer them not to be associated with the Peking Economic Conferencesince we consider that its primary purpose is political;  we have also taker theinitiative in urging other Paris Group countries to give similar advice to their nationals.9. To sum up:(1)      We are ready to introduce new controls on exports of strategic goods to China if all other countries in Europe will introducecontrols corresponding to our own on the same strategic goods.(2) We should, however, make it clear to the Americans that it isfor other countries to match what we are doing already before we can fairly be asked to do more.(3)     In the last resort I for my part should be prepared to consider an embargo on all trade with China, if all other countries would dothe same;  but any decision in this sense would need to be very closely examined especially from the point of view of its implications for Hong Kong and the Soviet bloc.P.T.Board of Trade, S.W.1.2nd March, 1953.
