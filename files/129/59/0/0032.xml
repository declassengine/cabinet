Theresolution is as follows:-&quot;The Trades Union Congress Education Committee have learnt with greatconcern of the decision of the Minister of Education to reduce the Ministry&apos;sgrants for adult education by ten per cent.   They believe that this cutmust inevitably result in a reduction of the very good work now being done.They re-affirm their belief that the maintenance - and, indeed, the expansion -of the adult educational services are essential to the well-being of the country^They are satisfied that in no branch of the large and important field forwhich the Minister is responsible does the nation get better value for themoney expended:  to every pound so provided there are added voluntary contributions and voluntary services by the organisations which accept responsibility for the provision of adult classes.   The Trades Union Congressgladly identify themselves with the large body of public opinion which asksthe Minister to reverse this most reactionary decision. &quot;I am now instructed to bring the terms of this resolution directly to your notice.Sincerely yours,(Signed)  Vincent Tewson.
