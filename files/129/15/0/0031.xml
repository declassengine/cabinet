f 111 Si(THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENTSECRETBURMA :__CONSTITUTIONAL position memorandum Toy the Secretary of State for BurmaMy colleagues will remember that subsequent to their agreement at the meeting on 5th December (CM. (46) 103rdConclusions, Minute 2) that we should invite a delegation ofthe Burma Executive Council to London I had to report(C.P.(46) 448 of 9th December) that the Working Committeeof the Anti-Pascist Peoples Preedom League (AFPFL) were readyto accept this invitation only if His Majesty&apos;s Governmentfirst announced that they accepted in principle the four maindemands of the Party,  including the demand that Burma shouldbe free to choose whether she should remain within the BritishCommonwealth.      Aung San informed the Governor that if thisparticular demand were accepted he did not think there wouldbe any difficulty in sending a delegation.2, The first view of my colleagues on this,demand wasthat it should be possible to frame a statement which, while not so specific as that made&apos; in regard to India, might, byre-affirming undertakings already given,  enable the ExecutiveCouncil without &quot;loss of face&quot; to accept an invitation to send a delegation (C.M. (4-6). 104th Conclusions, Minute 4).3. On further consideration,  however,  of the arguments for and against such a statement and after discussion with thePrime Minister,  I suggested (CP. (46) 452) that we were unlikely to make progress in this way, that,  as we had beenasked a straight question by Aung San, we should either saywe were not prepared to answer it now or give an affirmativereply on the lines I had proposed, and that it would be well toget the Governor&apos;s advice before we reached a final conclusion.My colleagues considered the draft of a telegram to theGovernor at their meeting.on 12th December and approved itsubject to certain amendments (C.M.(46) 105th Conclusions,Minute 3).      The telegram was despatched on 13th December andhas been circulated (No.  4587).4, On the 14th December I received a telegram from theGovernor (No.  259) in which he stated that his Inspector-General of Police was convinced that the Rangoon Police were going to strike again during January,  that the purpose of thestrike was definitely political and not economic and that he expected on this occasion that Police in the country districtswould join in the strike whereas less than 6,000 joined thelast strike in September.      The Chief Secretary agreed withthe Inspector-General in regard both to the probable imminenceand scope of the strike but did not agree with the latter&apos;view that the Police would still strike even if a DelegationCP.

SI218were to come to this country.      There is also some difference of opinion in regard to the probable date of the strike.The Inspector-General thinks&apos;it is timed for the first week in January:      the Governor believes it is timed for31st January the date on which AFPFL have notified their intention of resigning from the Executive Council unless HisMajesty&apos;s Government accedes&apos; to their demands.5. The Governor&apos;s reply to my telegram of 13th December(see paragraph 3 above) has now been received and circulated(No.  262 of 17th December).      It will be seen that he came tothe conclusion that the situation could not support the delaywhich further telegraphic correspondence would have entailedand that he therefore has had further interviews with Aung Sanand with Tin Tut,  the finance and Revenue Member of theExecutive Council, who,  as an experienced member of the I.C.S.recently retired, Aung San evidently finds a useful aide.6, It is clear from his  telegram that - -(i) the Governor sees no practical alternative but torecommend to His Majesty&apos;s Government that a break withAPPPL should at all costs he avoided     and(ii) as a condition of accepting an invitation from HisMajesty s Government that the Executive Council should send a delegation here, APPPL arc still determined to extract fromHis Majesty&apos;s Government an assurance in terms closelycomparable with that given to India by the Prime Minister inhis speech of 15th March last that Burma will have freedomof choice whether to remain within the Commonwealth or gooutside it.7. In view of the Governor&apos;s appreciation and of thesignal from the G.O.C.   (90/10 of 13th&quot;&quot; December). to the effectthat the forces at the disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare    not adequate to hold the situation,  I see no alternative but to go as far as we possibly can to moot the views ofAPPPL and in particular to give the assurance asked forregarding the right of the Burmese after the Constitutionhas been framed to leave the Commonwealth.8. It may be that before this matter is considered by my colleagues the Government&apos; will have been able to reportthe wording of the formula which APPPL stipulate.P-L.Burma Office,  S.W.  1. ,18th December,  19461
