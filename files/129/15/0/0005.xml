HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY  OF  HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMEMTPrinted for the Cabinet.  December 1946SECRETCP. (46) 4393rd December, 1946Copy1&apos;Wo.   29CABINETMALAYAN policy memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs on behalfof the Colonial Affairs CommitteeLAST year the Cabinet agreed that we should create an effective-constitutional Union in Malaya, backed by a common citizenship which wouldbe open to all, whether Malays, Indians, Chinese or others, so long as they had adopted Malaya as their true home.2. The steps taken to carry out this policy met with very strong resistancefrom the Malays, who thought that they had not been sufficiently consulted in the preparation of it; and for several months the Governor-General of Malaya,Mr. Malcolm MacDonald, and the Governor of the Malayan Union, Sir EdwardGent, have been negotiating with Malay representatives, with the object ofworking out revised proposals agreeable to them.3. These negotiations have now been completed and the Cabinet are now&quot;asked to give conditional approval to the resulting proposals before they are discussed with the other communities. There is no question of final approvalI until this discussion has taken place. &apos;4.   The new proposals are set out in the attached memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies, which was considered by the Colonial AffairslCommittee on 2nd December.   The proposals are summarised in the followingIparagraphs.Constitution5.   The following are the proposals :  (i) There should be a High Commissioner with an Executive Council, whichwill have administrative functions throughout Malaya in respect of federal matters.(ii) There should be a Central Legislative Council under the High Com-missioner, with the right to legislate on all the most importantsubjects, including defence and finance. It will be composed of 14officials and, on the unofficial side, of 11 representatives of the Stateand Settlement Councils (see (iii) below) and of 23 persons who wouldbe nominated by the High Commissioner, until election becomesfeasible. Of these 23, 9 would be Malays and 14 would representimportant interests such as labour, mining and planting.(iii) There should be Legislatures in each State and in the two Settlementsof Penang and Malacca. These would legislate on all matters notreserved to the central body.(iv) In each State there should also be a State Executive Council with executive authority in a number of fields of local administration.(v) There should be a central Conference of Rulers with functions whichwould be almost entirely formal.6.   This constitution seems a little complicated and it may be that in coursefi time some streamdining may be possible.  We consider, however, that it securessatisfactorily our aim of establishing a strong central Government, while givino-sufficient scope for healthy local activity.[32795] B
27. We have only one comment. The Secretary of State for the Coloniesthinks it would be preferable that the High Commissioner, in making nominationsto the Central Legislature, should not be required to nominate 14 persons torepresent specific interests, as this might produce too sectional a point of view in the Council; instead he should be given discretion as to whom he should nominate.   We agree with this view.Citizenship8.   Citizenship is to be open to (i) any Malay born in the country, or the child of a father who is the subjectof one of the Rulers;(ii) British subjects born in Malaya, if their fathers were born there or haveresided there for 15 years;(in) British subjects born in the two Settlements if they have themselvesresided there for 15 years;(iv) all others born anywhere in the territory if both their parents were bora.there and have resided there for 15 years.In addition, children of citizen fathers would themselves automatically becitizens, and the High Commissioner would also have power to grant citizenshipat his discretion to persons fulfilling certain residence and language qualifications and prepared to make affirmations of loyalty and continued residence.9. We have considered these proposals carefully and regard them as reason-able, subject to a minor point regarding naturalisation of the subjects of the rulers, with which the Cabinet need not be troubled. In cur view the proposalsmeet satisfactorily the criticisms which were made in Parliament early this year.Jurisdiction10. The proposals are set out in paragraph 8 of the Secretary of Statedmemorandum and I need not repeat them. We regard them as wholly satisfactory,with one exception. They require the consent of all the Sultans for any amend-ment of the Constitution. We agree with the Secretary of State for the colonies in thinking this unsatisfactory in principle. He suggests, and we agree, thatamendments of the Constitution should require the agreement not of each Sultanindividually but of the Conference of Rulers, i.e., in effect of the majority ofthe Sultans.Courts11. All courts will be set up by federal legislation. The Supreme Courtwill have jurisdiction throughout the federation and provision is made for appealto the Privy Council.  We regard this as highly satisfactory.Action Recommended12. We consider it very satisfactory that proposals have been evolved which both preserve the fundamental objectives of His Majesty&apos;s Government andsatisfy Malay feelings. The Secretary of State for the Colonies sets out inparagraphs 12 and 13 of his memorandum the course which he now desires tofollow.  We recommend that he should be authorised to proceed as he proposes.A.Dominions Office, S.W. 1,3rd December, 1946.
ANNEXMALAYAN policy memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies on 31st May, 1944,* the War Cabinet, taking as their basis the recom-mendations of a Ministerial Committee under the chairmanship of the present prime Minister, gave their provisional approval, for planning purposes, to anew policy for Malaya whose fundamental objectives were the creation in that territory of a real and effective constitutional unity, and the establishment of acommon citizenship which would grant political rights to ail those who genuinelyregard Malaya as their home and as the object of their loyalty. On 3rd Septem-ber, 1945,t my predecessor sought and obtained the Cabinet&apos;s final authorisation of this policy, and their agreement to the proposal that Sir Harold MacMichaelshould visit Malaya in order to conclude new agreements with the nine MalaySultans, whereby the latter would grant jurisdiction in their States to HisMajesty.2. Sir Harold MacMichael had completed his task by the end of last year.In due course, the policy was approved by both Houses of Parliament, and theOrder in Council setting up the Malayan Union was then issued, in time for theGovernor of the Union to take up his functions at the termination of military administration on 1st April last.3. On 3rd June,i. my predecessor gave the Cabinet an oral account of developments since 1st April. An organised Malay nationalist movementextending over the whole Peninsula had emerged, and it will be recollected thatcertain features of the new constitution had met with vigorous and unitedresistance from the Malays, who did not consider that they had been sufficientlyconsulted before the new system had been brought into force, and who expressed their objections in a refusal to co-operate in the activities of Government. this situation threatened at one time to become extremely dangerous, with the prospectof the Malays, united as never before, pursuing a policy of wholesale non-co-operation which might at any moment have degenerated into actual violence.Although the constitution provided for the fullest consultation between thecentral authority and the local State Councils proposed as to powers, representa-tion and structure, and for consultation on the terms of citizenship, it was evidentthat the enforcement of the proposals against the will of the largest section ofthe community in Malaya would only defeat the very objectives of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment as stated in paragraph 1 above. Accordingly, the Governor of the malayan Union and later the Governor-General entered into discussions withMalay representatives for the purpose of arriving at an agreed solution withinthe essential framework of His Majesty&apos;s Governments policy. I am happy tosay that, notwithstanding initial hesitations, the Sultans and the Malay leadersresponded to this approach in a statesmanlike manner, and from the beginningof August until the middle of November a Working Committee, consisting ofrepresentatives of the Sultans and the principal Malay political party on theone hand and of Government representatives on the other, was busy elaboratingthe details of a revised constitution. At a subsequent plenary conference, theSultans and the representatives of the political party mentioned above indicated to the Governor-General and the Governor of the Malayan Union that they were satisfied with the scheme. The proposals were thereupon submitted to me for myprovisional scrutiny. It must be understood that these proposals represent aconsiderable effort at accommodation by the Malays, and a basis which they agree can be offered for further consultation with the other communities in malaya.4. I have now had time to study the whole scheme with the assistanceof the Governor-General and of certain officers of the Malayan Union Govern-ment who have flown with him to this country. One of the most encouragingfeatures of the Working Committee^ deliberations has been the manner in whichthe whole Committee, Malays and Government representatives alike, accepted the* W.M. (44) 70th Conclusions, Minute 3.I CM. (45) 27th Conclusions, Minute 3.I CM. (46) 54th Conclusions, Minute 5.[32795] b 2
essential purposes of His Majesty&apos;s Government as described above, as the basisof their deliberations, and I am happy to record my own conviction, after examining the documents in detail, that the resultant proposals, in their main provisions, are calculated to achieve these purposes in an effective manner.Constitution5. First, I am satisfied that the proposals will achieve the object of estab-lishing in Malaya a strong central Government, With control over all mattersof importance to the welfare and progress of the country as a whole. Therehas been drawn up a list of subjects upon which the right of legislation has been reserved for the Central Legislature alone, and this list, which embraces 144 items(see Appendix for important example) is extremely comprehensive. It ensuresthat so far as can be foreseen all legislation of any considerable importance will, infact, be in the hands of the Central Legislature, which will also maintaineffective control in the all-important sphere of finance. On the other hand,it is proposed that executive authority, under central legislation, will beentrusted in a number of fields of local administration to the authorities in theindividual States and in the settlements of Penang and Malacca. I do not regard this as materially detracting from the authority of the centre, but rather asensuring healthy and constructive local activity within a limited sphere.6.   The organisations of Government to carry out the functions described above are as follows : Pirst, in place of the Governor there will be a High Com-missioner with an Executive Council.   Secondly, there will be a central Legis-lative Council, consisting of the High Commissioner as President, three ex-offickmembers, eleven other official members and thirty-four unofficial members, of jwhom eleven will be representatives of the State and Settlement Councils.Thirdly, there will be a Legislative body in each State, with the title of &quot; Council jof State,&quot; and similar legislative bodies in each of the two British Settlements, 1Fourthly, there will be established in each State a body with the title of &quot; State IExecutive Council,&quot; which will carry out the executive functions provided for under central or State legislation.   Fifthly, there will be a central Conference of IRulers, whose functions will be almost entirely formal and consultative (see 1paragraph 9 below).   I have been in some doubt regarding the necessity for StateExecutive Councils and it may be that in course of time some &apos;&apos; streamlining&quot;of State Government machinery may be found advisable.   I am advised, how-ever, that the Malays attach great importance to the establishment of the State BExecutive Councils, on the grounds that the Sultans, who are envisaged as Ipresiding over the State Executive Councils but not over the Councils of State,should henceforth be treated as strictly constitutional princes and not as absoluteRulers.   I am further advised that adequate provision has been made to preventthe possibility of deadlock between the Legislature and the Executive in theStates.Citizenship7.   I also consider (subject, of course, to the views of the non-Malaycommunities, a point of fundamental importance to which I shall revert later)that the proposals regarding citizenship are designed to give reality to our essential objective of granting political rights to all those who regard Malayaas their real home and as the object of their loyalty.   This matter is one ofpeculiar delicacy (a fact which His Majesty&apos;s Government recognised when they agreed, in the House of Commons on 18th March, not to implement their citizen-ship proposals pending local consultations), and the task of the working committee has accordingly not been easy.   A most important feature of thepresent proposals is the provision that children of citizens will themselves auto-matically be citizens.   This will encourage the growth, in course of time, of an flincreasing body of men and women irrespective of race or creed, who will regard Hcitizenship as a birth-right, and an effective bond of common loyalty will thus be Icreated.   As regards the provisions for the initial creation of a body of citizens, Iit is proposed, in effect, that a Malay should qualify automatically for citizenship Iif he is born in. the country or if he is the child of a father who is a subject of one Hof the Rulers; that a British subject born anywhere in the territory should auto- jmatically qualify if his father was either born there or has resided there for fifteen jyears; that a British subject born in either of the Settlements should alternatively Iqualify automatically if he himself has resided there for fifteen years; and that all others born anywhere in the territory should automatically qualify if both their jparents were born there and have resided there for fifteen years.  My provisional I
view is that these stipulations are reasonable. The special provision for Malaysis justified on the grounds that Malays born in the country, whether or not they aredescended from comparatively recent immigrant stock, regard Malaya as their onlyhome and the only object of their loyalty. The special provision for British sub-jects born in the Settlements, as against British subjects born elsewhere in theterritory, is justified on the grounds that the two settlements include a large bodyof Indians and Chinese who are truly &quot; Malayan&quot; in spirit, who are intenselyproud of their status as British subjects and who, incidentally, would be theErst to resent any indiscriminate &quot;opening of the flood-gates &quot;&apos; to Indians and chinese whose loyalties lie elsewhere in Malaya. In general, the proposals are designed to exclude the large transitory element in the population, but to include all those who are ready to accept the duties as well as the rights of citizenship.Finally, it is proposed that the High Commissioner should be empowered, subjectto his entire discretion, to grant citizenship on application to persons who fulfilcertain residence and language qualifications and who are ready to make affirmations-tions of loyalty and continued residence in the country.His Majesty&apos;s Jurisdiction8. One matter which has given rise to special difficulties in the deliberationsof the Working Committee has been the question of His Majesty&apos;s jurisdiction inthe Malay States. This jurisdiction in the Settlements, of course, remains com-plete. Under the MacMichael agreements the Sultans conferred full jurisdiction in their States on His Majesty, and this is one of the principal points to whichthe Malays have objected. His Majesty&apos;s Government, however, have neverregarded jurisdiction as an end in itself, but merely as a means of ensuring thefuture progress of Malaya towards self-government. Subject to one exception to which I shall refer later, I regard the present proposals, judged from thispoint of view, as satisfactory. It is proposed that the revised constitution shouldbe embodied in a new agreement, but it has been agreed that legal force in the malay States should be given to the new agreement by His Majesty&apos;s Order inCouncil under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act. There would also be separate agree-ments with the individual Rulers superseding previous agreements including thosenegotiated by Sir Harold MacMichael. All these agreements would be ratified byenactments of the various Councils of State. Thus a firm legal foundation is pro-vided for the establishment of the revised system. Thereafter it is proposed thatHis Majesty should have jurisdiction in all matters relating to external affairs and defence. This would include the necessary internal jurisdiction in relationto such matters, the advantages of which, particularly in times of crisis, are obvious. It is further proposed that His Majesty should have jurisdiction for thepurpose of appeals to the Privy Council, that His Majesty should in effect havethe power to disallow laws, and that there should be the usual provision for the reservation of bills for His Majesty&apos;s pleasure. Lastly, it is.proposed that inall matters of Government excepting (a) amendments to the constitution and (&amp;)matters relating to Moslem religion and the custom of the Malays, the HighCommissioner, and the British Adviser in each of the States, should have thepower of tendering advice to the Ruler, which the latter would be bound to accept.In this whole connection it will, of course, be appreciated that under the schemegreat powers have been surrendered by the States to the central authority, andthat the Sultans have delegated powers over an immense field to the HighCommissioner.9. The one feature of the proposals regarding jurisdiction which I regard as unsatisfactory is the provision that future amendments to the constitution would require the consent of the Sultans, a provision which would, in theory,enable any one Sultan to block future constitutional progress. I am advised that the recent emergence of political awareness amongst the Malays is such that it is most unlikely that any Sultan would be able to follow his personal willin such matters in future, but the provision remains unsatisfactory in principle.The present proposals (as stated in paragraph 6 above) include the establishmentof a Conference of Rulers- a body with certain purely consultative and formalfunctions and I have it in mind, subject to my colleagues&apos; consent, to stipulate that future constitutional changes should require the agreement of this body(that is, in effect, of a. majority of Sultans) and not of each Sultan individually.10. It is proposed that the revised constitutional system should be described as the &quot; Federation of Malaya.&quot; I would have preferred some title which wouldhave included the word &quot;Union,&quot; as being more indicative of the closely-knit
system which is in fact envisaged, but I am advised that this is a point on whichthe Malays have proved adamant, and in these circumstances I consider thatit would be most unwise to press the point further.11. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that there is no question of HisMajesty&apos;s Government giving their final approval to any of these proposals untilthe other communities in Malaya, besides the Malays themselves, have been fully and freely consulted. The Malays themselves have clearly recognised this, butat the same time they have pressed that if there are any points in the present proposals which His Majesty&apos;s Government consider definitely unacceptable,these shall be referred back to them for further consideration before the widerdiscussions commence. In this connection the Governor-General and the governor of the Malayan Union have emphasised two points. First, they have told methat while the political situation in Malaya has greatly improved during thepast few months, there is a danger amounting to certainty that the improvementwill vanish unless His Majesty&apos;s Government now act with all reasonable speed.Secondly, they have urged that at the time when the wider discussions are opened,His Majesty&apos;s Government should indicate in definite terms their provisionalacceptance of the general scheme, subject always to the views of the non-Malaycommunities. It is emphasised that such an indication by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment will carry a stage further the process of recovering the goodwill and confidence of the Malays, will prevent the projected wider discussions from becoming extravagant and irresponsible, and will greatly help to achieve thatspeedy solution which is so essential.12. I see great force in these views, and I accordingly submit the following programme of action for the approval of my colleagues. First, I would ask theGovernor to take up with the Malays, with the least possible delay, the followingpoints which I still cannot regard as entirely satisfactory or as entirely clear :-(a) The agreement to be signified to future constitutional Changes shouldbe that of the Conference of Rulers and not of the Sultansindividually.(b) The constitution, and in particular the exact composition of the councils of State, in the various States has not yet been determined. It isof great importance that the State legislatures should be of a trulydemocratic character, and I would propose to say that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment must reserve all judgment on this matter until they seedetailed proposals.(c) It is proposed that the Central Legislative Council should have twenty-three unofficial members besides the representatives of the States and settlement Councils. It is further proposed that steps should be takento institute an electoral system as soon as possible, but this is not con-siclered feasible as an immediate measure. In the-meanwhile it isproposed that the High Commissioner should nominate these twenty-three members, of whom nine would be Malays and the remainderwould be chosen as representing important interests, such as labour,mining and planting a device which was primarily intended toensure adequate representation for the Chinese and Indians. I regardsuch specific representation by interests as liable to produce an undulysectional point of view in the members of the Council, and I would propose to say that, subject to the selection of nine Malays (which I regard as reasonable) the High Commissioner should have discretion in nominating the remainder, though he should bear in mind theimportance of securing a chamber broadly representative of all important economic, social and communal interests in the Peninsula-(d) There is one point in relation to citizenship which must be clarified. Ilis proposed that persons naturalised as subjects of any of the Ruler;should acquire citizenship by virtue of such naturalisation. There isroom for discrepancy here between the qualifications required fornaturalisation as a subject of a Ruler and those required for directapplication for citizensnip, and it must be ensured that there is in factno such discrepancy.13. Subject to the above points being satisfactorily resolved, I would pi&apos;0&apos;pose to inform the Governor of the Malayan Union that the proposals have theconditional approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and may forthwith be usedfor discussions with the non-Malay communities.   I also think it would be very
desirable that before the Christmas recess I should make a statement in Parlia-ment, outlining the present position. After making it clear that there were stillsome matters both of substance and important detail to be discussed with the malays, I should propose to conclude such a statement with words to thefollowing effect: &quot; I am happy to say that the present proposals, which represent the outcome of much patient and devoted work and of much constructive goodwill on both sides, appear to His Majesty&apos;s Government to be calculated to achieve those fundamental objectives in Malaya for which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have always striven. There can he no question, however, ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government reaching any final decision on any of the mattersinvolved until all interested communities in Malaya have had full and freeopportunity of expressing their views. I am glad to say that the necessityof consulting to the fullest extent the other interest/communities has beenclearly appreciated by the Malay representatives themselves. It is nowintended, therefore, that the proposals should, with the minimum of delay,form the subject of wider discussions in Malaj^a. His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill again consider the matter in the light of the results of these discussions,and at that stage the House will be given the opportunity of commenting on the proposals as a whole. Meanwhile, copies of the proposals as published in Malaya will be placed in the Library of the House as soon as they are received.&quot;A C JColonial Office, S.W. 1. &apos;29th November, 1946.APPENDIX1.
