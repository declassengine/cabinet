IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (46)  4511QTH DECEMBER,  1946CABINETTOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING bill memorandum by the Lord President of the council the memorandum and draft Bill prepared by the Minister of town and Country Planning (CP. (46) 432) was circulated to theCompensation and Betterment Sub-Committee of the lord president&apos;s Committee at the same time as it was circulated as a Cabinet paper;    and it may be of assistance to mycolleague if I summarise the conclusions reached by the Sub-Committee on a consideration of the Bill at three meetings which have just been concluded.2.      The problem, of the control of land use presents manyintractable features and any solution is open to objections ofone kind or another.    We ought, however,  to bear in mind thatthis Bill was promised in the Kingfs    Speech of last Sessionas well as this Session and that the Government will exposethemselves to grave criticism if they fail to grapple withthis subject early in the present Session.    Time is now short,having regard to the time whieh a complicated measure of this character is bound to occupy in both Houses;    and anyfundamental alteration of the principles underlying the draftBill is likely,  at this stage, to mean that we have no chanceof passing it into legislation this Session.3. The main conclusions reached by the Compensation and Bettment Sub-Committee may be summarised as follows:-Land Commission,  or Central Laad...T Board (Clause 2)4.      In order to avoid confusion with the Agricultural land commission, to be set up under the Agriculture Bill, it isproposed that this body to be set up under this present Billshould be called the Central Land Board.5.      It is undesirable to multiply Commissions and Boards ifthis can be avoided, but the Sub-Committee was satisfied thatthe creation of a Central Land Board was necessary in orderto prevent the Minister of Town and Country Planning from being directly responsible to Parliament for the amount ofevery development charge made in respect of a proposal to.develop land.    The Board should, however, consist only of a modest headquarters office, possibly with regional offices,and ail the detailed local work should be carried out by thelocal officers of the Chief Valuer whose organisation will,in any event, have to be greatly expanded in connection withthe proposed central valuation for rating.    These are,however&quot;, matters of administrative arrangement and do not involve any amendment of the Bill, apart from the alteration in title.COPY NO.g*  y

Local Planning Authorities  (Clause 4).6.      The Sub-Committee agreed that the scheme proposed by theMinister pi Town and Country Planning should Toe simplified&quot;by the abolition of the proposed area committees, which,&quot;being joint authorities not directly elected, would suffer -from the many shortcomings of that form of organisation.7.      The scheme proposed &quot;by the Sub-Committee is that incounties the county council, in preparing the development plan,  should consult the county district councils and, ifnecessary,  should call conferences of groups of county district councils for this purpose.    These would, however, simply &quot;beconferences oalled for the purpose of preparing the plan andnot separate authorities.    In regard to the grant of planning permission to develop,  the work would he carried out &quot;by thecounty district councils subject to directions Toy the countycouncil on general points of planning policy,  such as theprevention of ribbon development.    This scheme would ensurethat full use was made of the local knowledge of the county district councils and their officers in the consideration of applications for development and would avoid the creation of area committees.Authorities Responsible for Approving Development  (Clause 9)8.      Under the Bill, as drafted, there would be a duality ofresponsibility in respect of development connected withcertain services - notably, housing, water supplies, education and highways - where a Minister other1 than the Minister of town and Country Planning approves schemes prepared by localauthorities and statutory undertakers.    These localauthorities and statutory undertakers would, under the Bill as drafted, be under a statutory obligation, to obtain planningconsent for any scheme involving the development of land withan appeal to the Minister of Town and Country Planning, while at the same time they would be seeking the sanction of the responsible Department for the scheme.    A certain amount ofthis dual responsibility at the level of Government existsunder present legislation but the Bill would, in some ways,make the position more difficult since it represents e. tighteningof planning control.9.      All Departments are anxious to see that planningconsiderations receive full weight.    The question is entirelyone of machinery to ensure that there is no confusion ofresponsibility.10.      The Bub-Committee propose that, where development by alocal authority or statutory undertaker is subject to the approvalof a Minister, that Minister should be solely responsible in law for the development and that the Bill should be amendedaccordingly.    As a matter of administrative practice, Depart-ments responsible for services would instruct local authoritiesand statutory undertakers to put the proposed developmentbefore the planning authority and would consult the Ministryof Town and Country Planning in any cases of difficulty ordisagreement.    If Ministers failed to agree the matter wouldhave to come to the Cabinet or its appropriate Committee, butit would be for the Minister responsible for the service todefend in Parliament whatever decisions were taken.

11.      It would be well if the Cabinet were to instructall  1 9 7Departments to which this arrangement is to apply that theyshould arrange for local authorities and statutory undertakersresponsible for services to consult the local planning authorities before putting forward for sanction seimmesInvolving development and to report the result of these consultations with their application.    There should be an obligation on Departments to consult the Ministry of Townand Country Planning in any cases of disagreement between local authorities or statutory undertakers and local planning authorities,  so that the matter may he thrashed out at the regional or departmental level.Aoquisiton of hand (Clause 56)12.      The Bill, as drafted, leaves a certain amount ofambiguity whether,  in certain clasuos of oa.se,  the localauthority should apply for approval for the acquisition ofland to the Ministry of Town and Country Planning or,  e.g.to the Ministry of Health.    It is important that the position should he reasonably clear in the interests of  efficient administration, and the Sub-Committee agree that theacquisition of land by a local authority for a statutoryservice (e.g. the construction of a Becontree or a Wythenshawehousing estate)  should be sanctioned by the Minister of health or other Minister responsible for the service;    but that,where the local authority could not legitimately be expectedto effect the acquisition without grant assistance under thepresent Bill, as was the case in the redevelopment ofblitzed and blighted areas, and where it was not clear thatthe land was to be used predominantly for a purpose falling within the statutory responsibility of a single&quot;Department,the approving authority should be the Ministry of Town and country Planning.13.      Amendments are also required to clear up rather similarambiguities in Clauses 58 and 86.Housing, by County Councils14.      Under Clauses 36 and 38 the Minister of Town and Counts-Planning could empower county councils to undertake theprovision of houses in certain cases.    This has the disadvantageoaf causing some confusion of responsibility in regard to housing and the Sub-Committee felt that in all the circumstances the Bill should be redrafted to exclude any provision designedto enable county councils to undertake housing?; and other statutory functions of other authorities.    The Bill,  as drafted,was designed to meet a real need in certain areas;    but theMinister of Health believes that his default powers might beused in such cases,  and the time is perhaps not opportune-,for going as far as the Minister of Town and Country Planningproposes.Payment for Land Ccnxpulsorily Acquired (Clause 46)15.      Reference is made 3sn paragraph 8 of the Minister of Townand Country Planning&apos;s memorandum (CP. (46) 432) to the factthat the Chancellor of the Exchequer has the question of the1939 standard under review.    The Chancellor of the Exchequerprouoses next year to make value payments under the war damage Act and this will involve the preparation of a reportby the War Damage Commission whether the amounts payable shouldbe increased.    The report will provide an opportunity for exam-ining the case for a revision of the 1939 standard;    and it maybe that matters will, have advanced sufficiently for amendments to be introduced while the present Bill is in Committee.

11.      It would be well if the Cabinet were to instruct... all  1 9 s?Departments to which this arrangement is to apply that theyshould arrange for local authorities and statutory undertakersresponsible for services to consult the local planning authorities before putting forward for sanction aeJaemesinvolving development and to report the result of these consultations with their application.    There should be an obligation on Departments to consult the Ministry of Townand Country Planning in any cases of disagreement between local authorities or statutory undertakers and local planning authorities,  so that the matter may be thrashed out at the regional or departmental level.Agq.uisiton of Land (Clause 56)12.      The Bill, as drafted, leaves a certain amount ofambiguity whether, in certain clas-sos of oase,  the localauthority should apply for approval for the acquisition ofland to the Ministry of Town and Country Planning or,  e.g.to the Ministry of Health.    It is important that the position should be reasonably clear in the interests of efficient administration, and the Sub-Committee agree that theacquisition of land by a local authority for a statutoryservice (e.g.  the construction of a Becontree or a Wythenshawehousing estate)  should be sanctioned by the Minister of health or other Minister responsible for the service;    but that,where the local authority could not legitimately be expectedto effect the acquisition without grant assistance under thepresent Bill,  as was the case in the redevelopment ofblitzed and blighted areas,  and where it was not clear thatthe land was to be used predominantly for a purpose falling within the statutory responsibility of a single Department,the approving authority should be the Ministry of Town and country Planning.13.      Amendments are also required to clear up rather similarambiguities in Clauses 38 and 86.Housing, by County Councils14.      Under Clauses 36 and 38 the Minister of Town and CountyPlanning could empo?;er county councils to undertake theprovision of houses in certain cases.    This has the disadvantageGEf causing some confusion of responsibility in regard to housing and the Sub-Committee felt that in all the circumstances the Bill should be redrafted to exclude any provision designedto enable county councils to undertake housing and other statutory functions of other authorities.    The Bill, as drafted,was designed to meet a real need in certain areas;    but theMinister of Health believes that his default powers might beused in such cases,  and the time is perhaps not opportune-,for going as far as the Minister of Town and Country Planningproposes.Payment for Land Comnulsorily Acquired (Clause 46)15.      Reference Is made to. paragraph 8 of the Minister of Townand Country planning&apos;s memorandum (CP. (46) 432)  to the factthat the Chancellor of the Exchequer has the question of the1939 -standard under review.    The Chancellor of the Exchequerproposes next year to make value payments under the war damage Act and this will involve the preparation of a reportby the War Damage Commission whether the amounts payable shouldbe increased.    The report will provide an opportunity for exam-ining the case for a revision of the 1939 standard;    and it maybe that matters will have advanced sufficiently for amendments to be introduced while the present Bill is in Committee.

Compensation (Clause 50)15,      The Bill deprives the owners of land of its development value- (or the unearned increment,  in longstanding politicallanguage).  &apos; In accordance with the decision of the Cabinet on1st August (CM.   (46)  76th Conclusions, Minute 2) thecompensation provisions are based on the principle that ownersare not entitled to any compensation for the deprivation ofdevelopment value;    but that, where land which now has somedevelopment value was purchased since 1918, the owner shouldreceive some payment from the State for his out-of-pocket loss.Where tire owner has obtained such land by inheritance, he istreated as if he were a purchaser up to the percentage rate atwhich he paid death duties on his inheritance.    But apart frompurchases and inheritance of land, no compensation is provided on the transfer of development values to the State.    Whereland has remained undeveloped since before 1918, there willin most cases be no hardship In refusing to pay compensationfor development rights since the owner has shown no signs ofwishing to exercise them.17.      The original intention when this basis was adopted wasto refund the amount actually spent on the purchase of thedevelopment value.    For technical reasons this provedimpracticable and an alternative scheme on the same underlyingprinciple was adopted and is embodied in Clause 50 of the Bill.18.      The Lord Chancellor submitted to the Sub-Committee analternative scheme   under which the Government would make available, as an act of grace,  a sum of  250,000,000 ascompensation to all land-owners for the deprivation oftheir right to develop.    This sum would not be shared outuntil five years from the passing of the Act, but in themeantime the Government -would establish machinery to assess the amount payable to individual owners.    The total amountfound to be due would be scaled down to the figure of 250,000,000 and every land-owner would then receive hisappropriate&apos; share of the compensation within the limit laiddown.    It would probably be &quot;found desirable to classify theclaims into categories and to apply the scaling down lessdrastically&apos;to dead ripe land than to other categories.19.      The Lord Chancellor&apos;s scheme is based on the principlethat compensation should be calculated on the present valueof development rights,  irrespective of whether the owneracquired these rights by purchase,  inheritance or gift andirrespective of the date on which he acquired them,  &apos; It has some resemblance to the scheme put forward in the coalition government&apos;s White Paper on the Control of Land Use(Cmd,  6557 of 1944)  and It might postpone until a later elatesome of the controversy about the amounts which owners ofland should receive under the Bill.    If the figure of 250,000,000 were adhered to, it would probably prove lesscostly to the Treasury than the scheme in the Bill.20.      Against the Lord Chancellor&apos;s proposals,  it can be argued that the figure of  250,000,000 is entirely arbitraryand would be difficult to defend.-   The only hitherto publishedestimate of the amount of development value of land is the 400,000,000 quoted in the Uthwatt Report  (paragraph 3o)  fromthe Barlow Report.    This was the value in respect ofundeveloped land only, whereas the. 250,000,000 proposed bythe Lord&quot; Chancellor covers not only the development values of undeveloped land but also the redevelopment value ofdeveloped land.    Moreover,  the Government would be quiteunable to give an estimate of the proportions of each claimwithin the various categories which could be met from the total

sum made available for the purpose;    and, if the Uthwatt figure is anywhere near correct,  then when allowance is made for the redevelopment of developed land and for the inflation of claims bytheinclusion of floating value,  it is clear that the percentageof each claim which could be met would be small.    During thefive years&apos;  period before which any ,compensation would be paid out, the absence of any certainty as to the amount to be paidto individual owners would introduce an element of uncertaintyinto land dealings which would probably operate to preventthe development of land.SI.      The Sub-Committee was unable to reach any unaminousopinion on the rival propositions.    A great many alternative schemes have been examined during the prolonged examinationof the problem by the Coalition Government and the present government;    and no scheme is free from serious difficulties.A material consideration is the delay likely to be involvedin any extensive redrafting of the compensation provisions inthe Bill.    Unless the Bill is introduced in the immediatefuture,  it cannot reach the Statute Book by the end of the session;    and it would be an unwise waste of parliamentary time to introduce the Bill unless there is a reasonable prospect of its passing into law.Development Charges (Clause 66)22.      The Sub-Committee agreed that, as in the Bill, theamount of development charges should be a matter within the discretion of the Central Land Board, subject to ministerialregulations made with the consent of the Treasury.    TheMinister of Town and Country Planning is looking further into the question whether parliamentary control should be by affirmative or negative resolution.    Development charges are, in fact, a form of taxation and it may be that theregulations should be subject to affirmative resolution,at least by the House of Commons.Contributions Towards Compensation paid by Local Planning.Authorities Tciause 92j23.      Clause 92 empowers a Minister, where compensation falls to be paid by a local planning authority, in consequence of anything done under Part II of the Act,  to contribute towardsthe expenses so incurred such sums as appear to him, with theconcurrence of the Treasury, to be reasonable, havingregard to any special benefits secured in the national interest by the proceeding giving rise to the compensation.This is a very wide provision which may give rise to largeclaims by local authorities.    In the past, the matter hasbeen dealt with in exceptional cases by special paymentsauthorised under the Appropriation Act, and it appeared to theSub-Committee that the matter should be left on this basis and that Clause 92 should be deleted.White Paper24.      The Sub-Committee agree that the Minister of Town and country Planning should issue an explanatory White Paperwith the Bill.II. M.Privy Council Office,  S.W.I.ItTH DECEMBER,  1946
