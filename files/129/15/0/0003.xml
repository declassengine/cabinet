this document  is  the  property of  his  britannic  majesty&apos;s  governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1946 - &apos; v ^SECRETCP. (46) 43729th November, 1946CABINETTOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING bill memorandum by the Minister of health i am gravely concerned at the duplication of Ministerial jurisdiction andthe overlapping functions of Local Authorities which are envisaged in this bill as now drafted. As my colleagues are aware, complaint is rife that localauthorities with statutory duties to perform are hampered and delayed by the numerous consents and consultations required under the existing system. Theprocedure under this Bill will complicate matters still further, and we are in danger, I feel, of the machinery becoming so involved as to become intolerablyvexatious to all concerned.2. Under the Bill as drafted, a District Council proposing to develop landin the exercise of their statutory duties has to obtain a formal permission fromthe County Council with an appeal to the Minister of Town and country planning, notwithstanding that consent for the proposals may have to be obtainedfrom another Government Department charged with responsibilities for theservice concerned. It is, in my view, quite inconsistent with the duties expresslyor impliedly imposed by Parliament on the Minister of Health by the PublicHealth Acts, the Housing Acts, the Water Act of 1945 and the National health service Act, 1946, for proposals for which he must assume final responsibility to be made subject to a formal &quot; permission &quot; from the Town Planning authority with appeal to another Minister. Where the sanction or licence of a GovernmentDepartment is required to development, it should be necessary for the applicantto make one application only for authority to get on with the work, and that from the Government Department concerned who would take the necessary administrative steps to consult the Ministry of Town and Country Planning.3. There appears to be duplication of jurisdiction in the procedure foracquisition of land. Under Clause 35, where land is designated by a develop-ment plan as subject to compulsory acquisition by a local authority or statutory undertakers for the purposes of their functions, it is the Minister concerned withthe functions in question who authorises the compulsory acquisition of the land.But under Clause 36 the Minister of Town and Country Planning can apparentlyauthorise the. Council of the County Borough or County District in which the designated land is situate, or some other local authority including a CountyCouncil, to purchase the land compulsorily. I suggest that the powers of com-pulsory purchase under Clause 36 should not extend to land which can becompulsorily acquired under the provisions of Clause 35.Similarly, under the provisions of Clause 38 a local authority may, with theconsent of the Minister of Town and Country Planning, acquire land by agree-ment for a purpose specified in the development plan, although the purpose maybe one which requires the consent of some other Minister. The duplication should,I suggest be avoided.4. It would appear, though not clearly expressed, that under Clause 36and other provisions of the Bill the Minister of Town and Country Planningcould authorise a County Council to acquire and develop land for housing andother purposes which are at present the statutory functions of the district councils. I do not consider it necessary or desirable that County councils should become Housing Authorities, but in any case a fundamental change ofthis kind could more appropriately be made by a direct amendment of theHousing Acts.[32786]copy no. 2
5. There is further duplication of jurisdiction in the default powers of clause 86, which should be avoided. The Clause enables the Minister of Townand Country Planning to default the Council of any county borough or county district who fails to take steps for the acquisition of any land which in hisopinion ought to be acquired for the purpose of securing its use in the manner proposed by the development plan. The use of land in the manner proposed by&quot;the development plan may often be a use in connection with a function in respectof which some other Minister already has default powers, e.g., the Minister ofHealth in connection with Housing and Water Supplies, &amp;e.6.   To sum up, I suggest that the Bill itself should be amended to exclude-(1) the necessity of obtaining a permission to develop from the town planning Authority of all development (by local authority, statutoryundertaker or private person) sanctioned or licensed by a GovernmentDepartment either in pursuance of a statutory provision requiringtheir sanction or licence or by way of loan sanction;(2) from the compulsory purchase provisions of Clause 36, any land whichcan be acquired by, or on the authority of, a Minister under Clause 35;(3) from the provisions of the Bill any power to a County Council to acquireand develop land for any purpose for Which they have at present no statutory function and which is the statutory function of some other local authority or statutory undertaker;(4) from the default powers of Clause 86 the acquisition of Land for any purpose for which, a Minister already has default powers.A.
