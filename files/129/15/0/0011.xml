98(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;&apos;S GOVERNMENT)s, e-c,,.r; e; tCP, (/4.6) Uk5.7.TH december,, 19h -    cabinetROYALIST YUGOSLAV EX-PRISONERS OF MAR IN THEBRITISH ZONE OF GERAL4NYMerrpr&amp;ndum by the Chancellor&apos;., of trie.. Duchy of lancaster. I should like the approval of my colleagues forcertain steps which 1 propose to take in connection withthe problem of the ex-prisoners of war (FWX) in Germany.2. There are in the British Zone of Germany some,800 of these Royalist Yugoslav ex-prisoners of war(1,800 Officers,  I5h00 NCOs and 5,500 Privates) who were captured when fighting against the Germans in 191+1.They are in camps under0 &quot;CMir &quot;own officers and haveretained their military status.      Although everything possible has been done to eliminate anything in the natureof military formations and exercises,  the military character of these men has been fostered by the very strong royalist feeling of the bulk of the FtfX,  and the firm hold maintained by the officers over the men.3. It is desirable for a number of reasons that themilitary organisation of these PWX should be abolished.(l) As we have recognised the Tito regime, it isembarrassing for us to maintain in our ownzone a military formation of strong royalistsympathies,  and the Yugoslav Military mission and the Russians have made frequent attacks onus in Berlin for allowing these men to retain their military status.(2) The military discipline maintained by the yugoslav PWX makes it possible for theofficers to intimidate the men and prevent them from volunteering for repatriation.(3)  It is easier to persuade the PWX to acceptuseful work or repatriation when they have beentransferred to a civilian status and their units brokwn up.h.. Action to civilianise the Yugoslav PWX has notbeen taken earlier because, With the run-down of BritishL   military personnel, B.A.O.R.  found it necessary to employI a number of them on military guard duties.ii :-5-    -     A plan has now been prepared to meet the needs of.A.O.R. by the formation of a &quot;Mixed Civil   Watchmen&apos;service&quot;.      The strength at present proposed for thisCOPY NO.7

99service is 6,000, to be recruited from displaced persons of all nationalities, but primarily from Yugoslav ancPolish PV/X.      The members of this service will becivilians armed with rifles and organised in small unitsof 25 men;    their duties will be to assist the forces ofoccupation by guarding military installations in theBritish zone.6. This plan will make it possible to proceed with.the conversion of all Yugoslav Pv/X to displaced persons status.It is expected that this will be a delicate operation asobstruction may be encountered from the officers,particularly from the 8h senior officers of the rank ofOolonel and above,  all of whom are die-hard royalists.It is hoped that by tactful handling it will be possibleto carry out the operation without incident, but if it isfound that any officers are dissuading the men fromenlisting in the Watchmenrs Service or accepting other employment, it may be necessary to segregate them by force, which we are anxious to avoid in view of probableprotests in this country,, but which may still benecessary if the officers prove intractable.7. The  success of the operation depends very largely on the immediate removal of the 81;. senior officers fromGermany.      The Foreign Office are considering this,  andI hope that some solution will be found for this difficult problem.8. In view of the possibility mentioned in paragraph 6that in the last resort a certain amount of force may berequired, i feel that it is desirable to ask mycolleagues to approve the action which I propose to take in the near future viz t-(a) The issue of a proclamation in all YugoslavGamps announcing that from an early dateYugoslav PWX will lose their military status and will be regarded as displaced persons.This proclamation will emphasise the desire ofHis Majesty1 s Government that: as many aspossible should volunteer to return to yugoslavia.(b) Simultaneously,  the posting of notices calling for volunteers from PV/X for the proposed &quot;MixedCivil Watchmen&apos;s Service&quot;.      Members of this service will be selectee from personnel of the rank of   -Lieutenant Colonel and below j    thosewho are not selected will be required to take up other useful employment including timberwork, and -will in all probability bo removed from their present quarters.      It will be emphasised that membership of.the Watchmen1sService will not prevent anyone who so wishesfrom being repatriated at any time.
