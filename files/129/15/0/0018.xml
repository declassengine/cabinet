(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT)secret.r.(46) 4521.1th December, 1946. COPY NO ggjCABINETBURMA:   CONSTITUTIONAL position memorandum by the Secretary of State for BurmaAt their meeting on 10th December (CM, (46) 104thConclusions, Minute 4) the Cabinet invited the Prime .Minister and myself, in the light of the discussion, toprepare for consideration at&apos; their meeting on 12thDecember the draft of a statement that might be madeto the Executive Council and to Aung San.2.     I have considered further the arguments for and against a statement on the lines that my colleaguesfavoured yesterday. ^   In the result, and after discussion with the Prime Minister, I would like to urge a slightly different approach.     I do not think we shall make progress by reaffirmation of the undertakingswe have already given,  - We have been asked a straightquestion by Aung San and I think we should either saythat we are not prepared to answer it now, or that weshould give an affirmative reply on the lines proposed by me in paragraphs 11 and. 12 of C0Po(46) 448 of 9thI December.      But this, on further reflection, seems toI be a matter on which we need the Governor&apos;s advice&apos; before we takeva final conclusion and I suggest thatwe might telegraph to him in the terms of the draft attached. - .P.-L.Burma Office, S.W.1.11th December, 1946.

DRAFT&apos; TELEGRAMSECRETARY OF STATE FOR BURMAGOVERNOR OF &apos; BURMAPersonal  or Governor.Your 248 oT 7th December.     Matter has nowbeen considered by Cabinet.2.     Handling of this matter by Executive Counciland AFPFL leaves us very uneasy.     The conversationsthat have taken place have Mall the appearance ofa carefully laid plan by AFPFL to endeavour tosecure concessions of substantial importance from us in advance of any conversations.     Assurancenow asked, while it is one that we would be readyto discuss as part of the London conversations,will, if given immediatelys leave us with no major political concession to announce as fruit of thoseconversations. They will be difficult to conductin any case and fact that there is no furtherspectacular fea,ther to put in their cap will increase the risk of delegation returning to Burmawith feelings of disappointment and calling outthe Executive Council,3.     Nor do we feel any confidence that process ofextorting concessions in advance is at an end.     Ontechnique so far employed it would not be surprisingwere&apos;AFPFL after announcement of decision by HjvhGwto receive delegation to allege that public opinioninsisted that some further specific concession should be made before delegation could proceed.4.     We quite accept difficulty of the position

that has to be faced in Burma and extent to which,we are at a disadvantage owing to our weaknessin troops and unfortunate effect on police morale of recent strike.     But there is a point at whichit may be necessary to face whatever risks are involved in AEPFL going out.     Meanwhile we areurgently considering what arrangements can be madeto reinforce with British troops and shall be glad to have your appreciation of the situation whichis likely to. develop if extreme courses were tobe pursued by AFPFL and what reinforcement would suffice to hold it.5.     Cabinet after full consideration of question in all its aspects are most reluctant to give anyfurther assurances or commitments in advance ofdiscussion in London.     There is reason to thinkthat there would be strong Parliamentary objectionnot confined &quot;to any one party to giving a formalundertaking in advance of any discussion, thatBurma-would be free to leave the Empire and to a party which has no electoral mandate and which wecannot at this stage accept as necessarily entitledto talk on behalf of Burma as a whole.6.     Cabinet in these circumstances feel that weshould take the line that i-LMll , without any delayor hesitation, responded to Council&apos;s requests foradvance in the constitutional field by suggestingdiscussions&apos; in London.     We shall have no desireto restrict the field of discussion or to prevent

the representatives of the Council from raisingin those discussions any point they wish.     Oursincerity and anxiety to help Burma forward areunchanged.     But.we are not asking them to pledgethemselves on any point in advance of discussion and it is not reasonable that they should press usto do so.     We trust therefore that they will nowbe prepared to accept invitation and leave allthese matters for discussion on their arrival.7.    1 We have considered possibility of authorising-you to make a further statement to the effect thatit is our policy to enable the Burmese to achieveself-government and to determine their own future;that the means of making progress towards this endis a matter for discussion with Burmese leaders;and it is for this purpose that it is desired thata delegation should visit this country.     Wecontemplated po s sib ly underlining the difficultyof giving complete autonomy in advance of elections and the working out of a new constitution andreminding them that demands for further financialconcessions must be decided in the light of thefinancial position of the country.     But on thewhole we think the wiser course is not to exposesurface.     Executive Council might claim that sofar as any such statement was a reaffirmation, it did not add to the pledges already given by H.M..G.:and, that so far as it warned them of the great difficulties which they still had to surmount, it

threatened a rejection, in advance of certain of the matters they would wish to press if they came to London.,8.     Please telegram, urgently your view on:(i) line proposed in paragraph 6 above and tacticsyou would propose to adopt in handling this matter with Aung San and the Council;\( ii) question whether in advance of acceptance byExecutive Council of our invitation it would bedesirable to announce publicly that we had invited&amp; representative delegation of the Council to visitthis country for constitutional discussions&apos;andcourt the risk of their declining to accept suchinvitation;   or(iii) issue a formal invitation to the Councilbut postpone any public statement until we knewwhether they had. accepted;     They should appreciate that if they refuse we shall have to make our own position clear beyond question and that results maybe very damaging to Burma and: to the reputation forresponsibility of her- political leaders.9.     Please include in your reply your views in answer to the concluding sentence in paragraph above.
