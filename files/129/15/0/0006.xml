this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1946SECRETCP. (46) 440ltd December, 1946Copy No-2 9CABINETSTATEMENTS AFTER QUESTIONS.Note by the Prime minister when Parliament is in session, important announcements of GovernmentIpolicy should be made, in the first instance, in Parliament. At the same time,the House of commons will be critical if too many announcements are made byway of statements at the end of Questions. And, from the Governments pointof view, it is desirable that such statements should not encroach unduly upon thetime available for the Orders of the Day.2. I therefore ask all Ministers to co-operate in reducing the amount ofParliamentary time which is taken up by statements after Questions. I ask mycolleagues to pay particular attention to the following points : (a) Before proposing that an announcement should be made by way of astatement after Questions, Ministers should satisfy themselves thatthe subject matter is of such importance as to warrant this methodof announcement and that there is no other means by which theinformation could equally well be conveyed to the House.(b) If such a statement is necessary, it should be made in the smallest possible number of words. Ministers should give their personal attention tothis point.(c) Wherever possible, use should be made of the device of making a shortoral statement covering the main points and leaving the details to be printed as a written statement in the Official Report.(d) Even if the statement is to be made at the end. of Questions it is oftenpreferable that it should be related to a Question on the Order Paperrather than volunteered by the Minister. Where time allows, theannouncement should be made in reply to a Question put down for answer on a day on which the Minister&apos;s Questions will be reached.32798
2(e) It is only in exceptional circumstances that a Minister should askMr. Speaker to allow him to give, at the end of Questions, the answer to a Question which has been set down for oral answer but has notbeen reached.3. I also ask my colleagues to conform in future with the following procedure : -(a) Ministers proposing to make a statement after Questions, whether or not it is related to a Question on the Order Paper, should notify myPrivate Secretary as early as possible and in any event not later&quot; than10 a.m. on the day on which the statement is to be made. Particularsshould be given of the subject matter of the proposed statement, thedate on which it is desired to make it, and the grounds for making iton that date and adopting this method of announcement. It shouldalso be stated whether the announcement has been approved by theCabinet or one of its Committees.(b) Copies of the draft statement should be sent, as soon as it is availableto my Private Secretary and to the Leader of the House of commons and the Chief Whip. These copies should arrive not later than10 a.m. on the day on which the statement is to be made.(c) It is at times desirable that a copy of such a statement should be shown to the Opposition shortly before it is made. If this is desired, a copyof the final text should reach the office of the Chief Whip in the Houseof Commons not later than 10 a.m. on the day on which the statement is to be made.(d) It may sometimes be expedient that a statement should be made simultaneously in the House of Lords. Ministers should, where necessaryconsult the Leader of the House of Lords on this point.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S. W. 1,3rd December, 1946.
