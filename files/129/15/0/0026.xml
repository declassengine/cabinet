(THIS- DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT)secret, P. (46)46014TH DECEMBER, 1946 &apos; &apos;      COPY NO.-^M/^CABINET   -&apos; CLOTHES RATIONING, - ......  ....----,...---- i --Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Burma.;ith reference to the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs&apos;memorandum (C. P. (46)458) regarding the probable effects on the Dominions of the proposals made by thePresident of the Board of Trade in CP. (46)442:, I must point out that the actual textile needs of Burma (and no&quot;doubt of other Far Eastern Colonies) are greater than thoseof the Dominions and that the continuance of the textile rshortage in Burma could not fail to have serious politicaland economic effects.   It is known that this shortage is   *one of the major factors leading to economic instability,dacoity and general unrest throughout the country, with consequent repercussions on the present political situation.There is the further repercussion that if the UnitedKingdom reduces its programme of exports to Burma in orderto increase its domestic ration, India, who has been askedto,make domestic sacrifices in order to help Burma, may alsodecide to reduce its programmed export, as it is alreadyanxious to do.   While, therefore, I shall be prepared toaccept a reduction in Burma&apos;s allocation from 2553 tons to 2000 (a reduction of POM) or even under protest to1600 (3.6^), I could not agree that Burma should give upmore in order to make up some of the loss to theDominions.2.     I am,.however, impressed by the suggestion that adecision, should be postponed until the Dominions havebeen consulted.   One result of such postponement mightbe that the prospects of Burma obtaining adequate supplies from Japan might well be clearer.   At present thenegotiations for these have been going on for eight months and there is still no certainty of getting sufficient quantities.   But negotiations in Washington are now nearingconclusion.    If these are satisfactory&quot;and Burma isassured of early Japanese supplies it is possible that she might feel able to accept a further reduction in UiK.allocations...
