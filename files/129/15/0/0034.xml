(46) 46850TH DECEMBER,  1946CABINETINDIAN policy memorandum by the Minister of defence the India and Burma Committee took the view that,though actual legislation could be avoided until the finaltransfer of power in India, it would be necessary to obtainat a much earlier stage some form of Parliamentary approval to the gradual devolution of our authority in India as weshould become, progressively, less able to carry out theobligations laid upon us by the Government of India Act.2. I take it therefore that if a statement was madein the form of the Annex to CP. (46) 456 it would be proposed to pass a resolution in the House of Commonsendorsing that statement.3. Whilst I am in agreement with much of the policy outlined in the draft statement, I should myself prefer that there should be a resolution framed on rather broaderlines, with a little more elbow room.      I attach a possibledraft of such a direct resolution for submission toParliament.A.V.A.Ministry of Defence, S.W.1,3 0th December, 1946.
