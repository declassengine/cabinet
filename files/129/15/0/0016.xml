ANNEX i telegram No.  2330 from the foreign secretary to. the Primes Minister3th December,  191+6,I have seen the progress reoort of 20th November19kb on the strength of&quot; British forces in Egypt.      Althoughas you say in your minute of 20th November commenting on thisreport,  this is more satisfactory,  the figures shown in thereport are still very worrying to me.      I notice for instancethat on November 9th there were still 22,000 British troopsin the Cairo district of which 6,000 were in Cairo city.There were a total of 8^,000 British troops in Egypt.      Allthese seem to me very high figures.      I first raised thisquestion of the groat number of British forces in Egypt inOctober of last year.      I took it up again in the spring ofthis year and have been pressing ever since to getsubstantial reductions.      There is no doubt in my mind that part of the strong and hostile attitude which we have had tosurmount in revising the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty has arisenfrom the presence of this large body of uniformed men on egyptian territory and especially in the centre of Cairolong after the war is over.(?Grp.  omitted ?paragraph 2).      If Egypt were totake this matter to U.N.O. which she will certainly do shouldthe treaty negotiations fail and it emerges that we have this large force of troops on foreign soil 16 months after the endof the Japanese war, we v/ill I think cut a very sorry figure.We cannot fall back on the 1936 treaty.      The number ofuniformed land forces which the treaty entitles us to mai.ntc.iinin Egypt in time of peace is 10,000.      At present the numberof such forces is 70,000.      This matter provides a sorryprospect ahead of us in the event of the present negotiationsbreaking down.      Even without reference by the egyptian government to U.N.O. we are now obliged by a decision of theAssembly to make reports to the Security Council of thenumber of troops on foreign soil as at the 15th December.In any case therefore we will be bound to reveal this largeforce and I am not at all happy about it.3. The existence of- a large British garrison in Egyptmust be having an    effect upon our demobilisation programme.The Minister of Labour should I think take an interest inthis matter.   &apos; So also I feel sure should the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer for there must be considerable foreign expenditure involved, &quot;much of which could be avoided if only we could reduce radically and quickly.if. I hope you will go into this question urgently.I think it should also be referred to the Cabinet.      Theservices must really move speedily over this.      I thinkField Marshal Montgomery is at present in the Middle East andI suggest that he should be asked to look^ into it himself with&quot; all these very important points in mind.5. I did notice incidentally in the figures that thereare still over 90,000 prisoners of war in Egypt.      Surely this figure should be reduced, thereby enabling us to reduce thenumber of men looking after them.

ANNEX IIMinute to the prime Minister from theSecretary of the Chiefs of Staff CommitteeThe Chiefs of Staff have considered a telegram&quot;from the Foreign Secretary criticising the rate of withdrawalof British troops from Egypt;    they could not agree thathis criticisms are entirely reasonable.2. The Defence Committee agreed/ the time-table for evacuation of Cairo and Alexandria as -(a) Evacuation of G.H.Q. to the Canal Zone assoon as possible. This was subsequentlyfixed as 1st January, 19h7-(b) Complete evacuation of Cairo and Alexandriaby 31st March,   19h7.      The Minister of state said that from the Foreign Office point ofview this programme was most satisfactory.The Foreign Secretary himself agreed withSidky Pasha that the evacuation of Egypt asa whole would be completed by 1st September,  1949.3&apos; The race of evacuation is governed by certainfactors.(a) The need to construct new accommodation inthe Canal Zone to house  the  troops evacuated from Cairo and Alexandria.(b) The need to re-provide base facilitieselsewhere to  replace  those which we shallhave to abandon in Egypt.km In regard to paragraph 3 (a) above,  theconstruction of accommodation takes time,  and is being pressed on with as quickly as available resources permit.5.        ^     In regard to paragraph 3 (b), the Chiefs of Staffsought^ certain decisions on our strategic, policy inJuly,  19h7 in order that the re-provision of base facilities could be planned elsewhere.      The Defence Committee did not feel able to give these decisions which are still outstanding.6. In spite of these difficulties,  the reductionseffected during the last month are considerable, as can beseen by the Progress Reports already submitted to you.      Thebulk of  the troops remaining are administrative in the caseof both the Army and the Royal Air Force.-1-* Wo.  2330 from New York to Foreign Office/ D.0.(h6)  21st Meeting, Minute 2j6 D.O. (h6)  80

7* The Chiefs of Staff wish to stress that thesero duct ions have been achieved, by accepting a far lower -j 9 ftstandard of accommodation than troops have a right to iwsexpect in peace-time.8.      .        The Chiefs of Staff wish also to emphasise inview cf the preliminaries which have to bo completed beforemovement begins, that it is not practicable to maintain an even flow of troops out&apos;of Cairo and Alexandria and thewhole of Egypt.      The first step was to provide accommodationelsewhere, and this is nearing completion.      Prom now on therate of evacuation of Cairo and Alexandria should, accordingto programme, proceed at an ever increasing rate.      Theprogress of evacuation of the Canal Zone must necessarilyremain slow until strategic decisions have been taken,  and installations are ready to receive those units evacuated from Egypt.      If the necessary decisions are taken in good time,  there is no reason to doubt that we shall meet the agreed date of evacuation.9* The Foreign Secretary refers to the military clauses of the 1936 Treaty.      The present strength ofBritish troops in Egypt can scarcely bo related to thenumbers permitted under the 1936 Treaty,  since the latterdoes not take into account the great expansion-necessary to conduct a war in Libya,      Moreover,  the end of hostilitiesdid not bring with it a marked lessening of our commitments in the Middle East, and we still have to maintain considerableforces in Palestine on a war footing.10. The Foreign Secretary also refers to the largenumber of prisoners of war still held in Egypt..    Theseare used extensively in most units throughout the Command,and are doing all the &quot;overheads1  such as driving transport,batmen, waiters, cooks,  orderlies and so on.      Any wholesaleremoval of prisoners of war at this stage would therefore have a most serious consequence an the Command as a whole and would very seriously retard the completion of the agreed programme.CONCLUSION11. The Chiefs of Staff appreciate the foreign secretary&apos;s point of view, but consider that under thecircumstances,   the rate of evacuation is proceeding at thefastest possible speed,  and is meeting the agreed programme.They are satisfied that the Commanders-in-Chief, middle east,  are fully alive to the situation,  and are making everyeffort to expedite movement.      They are of the opinion thatacceleration of our programme at this stage would lead tochaos and little saving of time,  ana certainly to financial loss&apos; by having to abandon stores or effect disposals at low prices.12. The Chiefs of Staff venture to  say  that they donot think there  should be any difficulty in defending ourrate of evacuation from Egypt before the Security Council,bearing in mind the marked difficulties of winding up our great war-time base,  and the fact that up to  the present,  the egyptians have accepted these difficulties and the agreed programme of evacuation.13. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff has just been to the Middle East,  and is due back in London on Monday,9th December.      He would be able to give you a first-handaccount of the progress which is being made,(Signed)    L.C. HOLLIS.th December. 19-U6.
