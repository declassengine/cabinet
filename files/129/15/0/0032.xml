S DOCUMENT   IS  THE  PROPERTY  OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENT   219^Printed for the Cabinet.  December 1946&apos;SECRET Copy No. 29CP. (46) 46630lh December, 1946CABINETFUTURE ADMINISTRATION AND CONTROL OF RELATIONS WITHTHE ARAB STATES OF THE PERSIAN GULFMemorandum by the Secretary of State for IndiaWHEN the Cabinet approved on 4th September last (CM. (46) 79th Conclu-sions, Minute 3) the joint memorandum on the conduct of foreign affairs affectingIndia (CP. (46) 329) presented by the Foreign Secretary and myself, they reachedno conclusion as to the Department of His Majesty&apos;s Government which should exercise the direct control of our relations with the Arab States of the persian gulf which it was decided to take over from the Government of India.2. Discussions have accordingly taken place between officials of theTreasury, Foreign Office, Colonial Office and India Office, with representativesof the other Departments having interests in the area, with a view to making recommendations on this subject, which involves a decision as to the Parlia-mentary Vote upon which the capital and recurring expenditure involved (thegreater share of which has hitherto been met by Indian revenues) should be borne.3. Control of the Political Resident on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentis at present exercised by the India Office in consultation with the other Depart-ments concerned. Hitherto the India Office has been able to operate, for adminis-trative purposes, through the Government of India. For the future the choicewould seem to lie between tlhe Foreign Office and the Colonial Office either ofwhich has certain qualifications for the exercise of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;sresponsibilities in the area. On the one hand, the Foreign Office are alreadyclosely concerned witJh the external relations of the Sheikhdoms which are quasi-independent protected States, and some of the functions performed by the british political officers are not very different from those carried out by certain of HisMajesty&apos;s consular officers stationed in Middle Eastern countries. The major problems which arise for decision in the Persian Gulf area are political in character, and touch on the relations of His Majesty&apos;s Government with the neighbouring foreign States, viz., Iraq, Persia and Saudi Arabia. The ForeignOffice, however, though willing to accept eventual transfer of the functions ofcontrol and to absorb suitable candidates from the staff into the Foreign Service,are not in a position immediately to assume responsibility for the administrative machinery.4. On the other hand, it was found that the Colonial Office are in a positionto accept immediate control and are qualified to do so owing to the circumstances that:  (a) they could provide administrative and other British staff, as vacanciesoccurred, from the Colonial Service;(b) tihey have already local associations with Arabia by reason of ColonialOffice administration of Aden Colony and Protectorate, control ofwhich was transferred to them from the Government of India in 1937;(c) they have much experience in indirect rule involving interference inthe internal affairs of protected States, such: as is, in practice,inevitable in the case of the Sheikhdoms; and(d) they are accustomed to supervise staffs performing duties of an adminis-trative character such as the bulk of the work of the political officersin the Persian Gulf (which also includes judicial duties).[32920]
2Moreover, the Colonial Office are well qualified to assist the State governments in developing medical, educational and welfare activities for which increasedrevenues from oil production are likely to provide opportunities. Nevertheless,the Colonial Office representatives pointed out that there might be disadvantages in their Department accepting responsibility in an area where the principalquestions affecting His Majesty&apos;s Government seem at present largely to concernrelations with neighbouring foreign countries and with the oil companiesoperated by companies with foreign shareholders. Further, Colonial Office controlof&quot; quasi-independent Rulers might be misrepresented, in interested quarters, asan intrusion of British &quot; Imperialism &quot; in this region.5. Thus, neither solution is ideal or free from difficulty. The balance of considerations points to the responsibility eventually falling to the Foreign Office.But there cannot be any interruption, and it is essential to secure continuity in theworking of the administrative machine and of our relations with the Rulers, whichat present proceed with smoothness and efficiency. Otherwise certain difficult and pressing questions relating to oil reserves which constitute His Majesty&apos;governments major strategic and economic interest in the area may not be successfully handled. This purpose will be best served if the changes are intro-duced gradually, and if the process of eliminating the Government of India fromthe administrative control of the Political Resident were to be entrusted to a department familiar with the Indian system. There would also be some advantage in leaving the position fluid for the time being.6. It was accordingly decided to recommend that, while the Foreign Office,rather than the Colonial Office, might be the eventual repository of this responsi-bility, for the present (a) the India Office should from 1st April, 1947, and as an interim arrange-ment, take over from the Government of India direct responsibilityfor the political posts in the Persian Gulf;(6) the cost of taking over and maintaining these posts hitherto met from indian revenues, but which will now fall to be defrayed by Imperialrevenues, should be borne on the India Office Vote with effect fromthe commencement of the next financial year;(c) the Foreign Office should, however, take over from the India Office full responsibility for these posts as soon as the administrative machinery inthe Foreign Office can be adapted to take over this task with efficiency.Effort should be made to effect the change by 1st April, 1948.(d) the Secretary of State for India should now be invited to negotiate withthe Government of India for the transfer to the direct control of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, on terms to be agreed with the Treasury, of theservices of the necessary personnel and of the buildings and facilities required for the service. These negotiations would cover settlement with India for His Majesty&apos;s Government^ interest in the buildings in Persia erected in part at the cost of Imperial Funds.7. I commend these proposals to my colleagues for their approval, and would only add that, if they are agreed, I shall also need authority to proceed at once with plans for the construction of a new Residency (comprising both office and living accommodation) to house the Resident and his staff, who are at presentoccupying temporary quarters, adapted from existing buildings, in the Naval base at Jufair. This building programme will, I fear, have to be undertaken entirelyat the expense of United Kingdom funds, since, with the elimination of theGovernment of India from a share in the control, the contribution from Indianrevenues which it had been hoped to secure can no longer be expected. Financialauthority for any such programme of works would, of course, be sought from theTreasury.8. The cost of the existing establishments and services in this area is atpresent of the order of  100,000 a year. The scale of expenditure will be subjectto reconsideration in view of the elimination of the Government of India&apos;s interest.On the other hand, heavy capital expenditure will have to be faced in the pro-vision of a new Residency, which might be of the order of  50,000.P.-L.India Office, S.W. 1,30th December, 1946.
