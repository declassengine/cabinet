.....Illlfl   I -   &apos; &quot;   &quot;^-^ 1HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;B GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December1946SECRET Copy No. 29CP. (46) 443mh December, 1946CABINETJAPANESE REPARATIONS DEADLOCKMemorandum by the Minister of state desire to consult my colleagues on the subject of the deadlock which hasbeen reached over Allied policy towards Japanese reparations and regarding theattitude which His Majesty&apos;s Government should adopt towards the latest proposals for solving the problem which have been put forward by the UnitedStates Government,2. The facts of the situation, with recommendations, are contained in aMemorandum prepared by the Chairman of the Ear Eastern (Official) Committeewhich is attached at Annex A. The recommendation of the Far Eastern (Official)Committee, contained in paragraph 6 of the Chairman &apos;s Memorandum, is thatHis MJajesty&apos;s Government should support the United States Government if theydecide to adopt the course of action contemplated.3. The United States proposal appears to offer the only immediate, practical solution of this long-standing problem and Far. Eastern (Official) Committee&apos;recommendation has my support.4. The Foreign Secretary has been asked for an indication of his views andif they are received in time I will communicate them to my colleagues, if necessaryorally.5. The views of the Governments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand andIndia have also been sought, and I hope that they may be available when the reparations problem is discussed in Cabinet.6. If the Cabinet approve the course of action recommended, they may wish that a telegram should be sent to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Washington, inthe terms of the draft submitted at Annex B. I would recommend, however,that the Governments of the British Commonwealth countries concerned shouldbe notified in advance of the reply which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom propose to return to the United States.H. McN. ,Foreign Office. S. W. 1,9th December, 1946.., ANNEX A ,,;Memorandum by the Chairman of the Far Eastern (Official) CommitteeJapanese Reparations DeadlockA deadlock has been reached over Allied policy towards Japanese repara-tions. The only obstacle to progress is the refusal of the Soviet Government,influenced by their acquisitions in Manchuria, to agree to the inclusion of japanese overseas assets in the reparations pool.   The matter has been argued13733   [32839]
for almost a year already, both in the Far Eastern Commission and m bilateralUnited States-Soviet negotiations. All members of the Commission, exceptRussia, ten in all, are agreed that no equitable decision on the division of reparations shares is possible if external assets are left out of account.2. The United States Government have the power to implement policy in japan and the issue, in the last analysis, is a political one between the UnitedStates and Soviet Governments. The United States Government consider that further delay in reaching a decision on reparations would endanger the executionof Allied policy in Japan. They regard the matter as so urgent that they have put forward the suggestion that they might now take action by means of&quot; interim &quot; directives to the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, a rightwhich the United States Government can invoke &quot; whenever urgent matters arisenot covered by policies already formulated by the Commission.&quot;3. Details of the procedure contemplated, as indicated orally to HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington by General Hilldring, the Assistant Secre-tary of State, on 6th November, are as follows :; The issuance by the United States Government of suitable interim directiveson reparations, determining levels of industry, making allocations of shares anddirecting removals.   The directives contemplated are : (a) an initial directive covering 15 or 20 per cent, of the total availablereparations, in order to get reparations deliveries rolling;(&amp;) directives covering the final comprehensive reparations settlement.4. The United States Government would invite all Governments on the far eastern Commission to participate in the formulation of the directives. Con-consultations would be conducted with representatives of the participating States,meeting continuously until interim directives had been prepared. It would be the aim Of the United&apos;States to produce interim directives that had the fullest possible support of the participants.5. General Hilldring stated that if the United States Government decide to proceed on the foregoing basis they would welcome our participation in the consultations, and he asked for an indication whether we should be willing toparticipate.6. The American suggestions and the issues which they raise have beendiscussed by the Far Eastern (Official) Committee. The Committee consider thatthe balance of advantage lies in supporting the United States proposals, if theUnited States Government finally decide to proceed along the lines indicated.They recommend that the reply to General Hilldring&apos;s approach should be along the lines of the draft telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washingtonattached at Annex B. They suggest, however, that the Governments of theBritish Commonwealth countries concerned should be informed of the policy ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom before a reply is returnedto the United States Government.7, In making the above recommendations the Far Eastern (Official) Coin-mittee had the following considerations in mind.8. The American scheme is open to the objection that it envisages action with regard to the control of Japan without Russian concurrence and, therefore,without the concurrence, as a body, of the Far Eastern Commission. If thescheme is adopted, and ten countries agree to a course of action opposed by theSoviet Union, there might well be repercussions on general relations with Russiaand the prestige and authority of the Ear Eastern Commission might be adversely affected.9. Further, if the interim&apos; directive procedure were to be adopted, theUnited States Government would, in the last analysis, have the final say as totheir content and might make decisions detrimental to the interests of the UnitedKingdom, e.g., decisions unduly favourable to China or the Philippines.10. As against the foregoing, the American proposal appears to afford thebest basis for an immediate, practical solution.11. Over a long period the United States Government have attempted toreach some basis of agreement with Russia, which would not, in its effect, be toounfavourable to other reparations claimants. These efforts have been unsuccessfuland there is little reason to believe that renewed negotiations would produce any more satisfactory result.
9412. The United States Government are admittedly entitled to determineunilaterally-what is. so. urgent, as to justify an interim directive. They wouldappear to be within their right, on a literal interpretation of the terms of reference of the Commission, in taking the action now proposed. It would be open tothem, in any case, to take this action whether other members of the Far eastern commission approved or not.13. The United States Government have expressed the desire for the fullest possible consultations with the other Governments concerned, and the procedure suggested would be a means of ensuring that the will of the majority of tencountries should prevail over that of the one recalcitrant country,14. The Governments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and India havebeen informed of the preliminary official view on the general lines as set out inthis paper and have been asked for an indication of their own views. Any replieswill be circulated to the Committee as soon as they, are received.15. While recommending acceptance of the American proposal as a basis for the solution of the problem, the Far Eastern&apos;(Official) Committee maintainthe view that the matter of first urgency is a decision on the levels of industry for Japan and that decisions on the allocation of reparations; shares should notbe allowed to overtake decisions on what is to remain in Japan. A proviso to this effect has accordingly been incorporated in the draft instructions to His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Washington. &apos;ANNEX draft Telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador (Washington)Your telegram No. 6459 [of 6th November: United States suggestions forending Japanese reparations deadlock].General Hilldring&apos;s communication has now been considered by Ministers.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom consider that thematter of first urgency is a decision on the levels of industry in Japan, and thatthis decision should precede and not, follow decisions as to reparations. they trust that the United States Government share this view and will agree that thefirst step towards the solution of the reparations deadlock is to press for a very early decision in the Far Eastern Commission on the levels of industry.3. While His Majesty&apos;s Government are in general agreement with theUnited States Government in their desire to solve the reparations problem withoutfurther delay and to break the deadlock created by the Russian refusal to includeJapanese overseas assets in the reparations pool, they consider that the suggestionput forward by General Hilldring, namely, that the United States government might proceed by the issuance of interim directives, would, if it is unacceptable to the Russians, be open to the same political objections as those which induced the United States Government to abandon their earlier proposal that aReparations Committee should be set up outside the Commission.   These are (a) the repercussions on general relations with Russia; and(&amp;) the effect on the prestige and authority of the Far Eastern Commission.4. If, however, notwithstanding the foregoing considerations, the UnitedStates Government should reach the conclusion that the urgency of the matter,together with the position taken by the Russians, leaves them no option but toproceed along the lines indicated by General Hilldring, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would support them, subject to the reservation regarding levels of industryindicated in paragraph 2 and provided that all British Commonwealth Govern-ments concerned were consulted at all stages both as regards reparations policyand interim deliveries.5. If, therefore, the United States Government decide to adopt the courseoutlined by General Hilldring, His Majesty&apos;s Government would gladly accept an invitation to participate in the formulation of interim directives on repara-tions and would be anxious to take part in all consultations held with a view to producing directives having the fullest possible support of all the participating

States.. They note with satisfaction that the intention of the United StatesGovernment would be for representatives of the. countries concerned to meetcontinuously until interim directives had been prepared.6. In the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, it is essential that removalsshould not overtake decisions as to levels of the industry that is to remain. HisMajesty&apos;s Government therefore recommend that, if a scheme along the lines suggested by General Hilldring is adopted, the procedure and timing should beas; follows : (a) every effort should be made to obtain a very early decision on the far eastern Commission on final levels of industry;(b) concurrently with (a), suitable arrangements should be made to start..       interim removals rolling; these not to be in excess of the &quot;surplus capacity &quot; already agreed by the Far Eastern Commission;(c) if, when the initial programme under (6) has been completed, no decision has yet been taken by the Commission on final levels of industry then the. &quot;consulting countries &quot; should make it their first task to;cometo an agreement on final levels among themselves and should not proceed with arrangements for further removals and for the final&apos; &apos;       allocation of shares until such agreement had been reached.His Majesty&apos;s Government would welcome, an indication of the views of the-United States Government on this programme.7. Please convey the substance of the foregoing orally to Mr. Byrnes or general Hilldring. ....... .................. -
