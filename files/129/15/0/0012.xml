(L*c^a^/il *3.jk * &apos;-d* &amp;q.v.*102HIS DOOUMhTT IS THE PROPERTY OF III3 BRITANNIC- MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNilNT)secret .P. (4-6)   Llj.6COPY HOCABINETMi3j(iorandrur.i.b,y the Chancellor of tho Duchy,.....;Of^Lancaster7&quot;&quot;&quot;&apos;   &apos;1. The question of exports of coal from the british zone of Germany was considered at tho 79th and 80thmeetings of tho Cabinet hold on hth and 9th September, 1946,As a result of the decision of the Cabinet at tho 79thmooting and further discussions between tho foreign secretary and the American Secretary of State it wasagreed that during the months of October and Novemberexport allocations of coal from Germany should bereduced by 150, 000 tons and  that in the l\. months from december;, 194.6,  to March,  1947, thoy should be reducedby a further 200,000 tons per month, making a total reduction during each of these months of 350,000 tons.Whilst this reduction was never regarded as satisfactoryfrom the point of view of the situation in Germany,  itwas accepted in the light of the international situation at tho time and the  stage that had been reached in theAnglo-American negotiations for economic fusion of tho two zones.      It may bo, however,  that tho Americans,  havingaccepted joint responsibility under the new agreement,i.iny now be prepared to consider more favourably a furthercut in exports of coal from tho British Zone and, if so,then in our own interests wo should at once make thoapproach to thoy   so as to secure the boat agreement to operate,  if possible,  from the next month&apos;sallocations (January) which are now duo.2. In illustration of the acute difficulties arisingfrom the present coal shortage in the British Zone,  Iwould mention the following(a) Stocks of loco coal at mid-November atReichsbahn depots amounted to loss than awook&apos;s supply.(b) During November,   shortage of coal for powergonoration led to regional sheddings of loadwhich have  seriously affected industrial production, e.g.  production of mining supplies and mild steel sheet for food canning.

103(c) Locomotive- and wagon repairs ore being set backhy power shortage and lack of steel components,paint,  etc.    Such increase in -repairs as has beenpossible has been achieved only by excessive- cannibalisation, a process the continuation ofwhich is now virtually at an end.      We are nowlosing 500 wagons per &quot;week, and this wastagewill very soon be reflected in such directions asfood distribution, exports of timber and coalde 1 i vor ie s therase 1 ve s.(d) The production of potash,  synthetic ammoniaand super-phosphate has been reduced since the-middle of October by the shortage of electricity,thereby cutting down fertiliser output.(e) Building industries were promised a special coalallocation for the production of materials for the repair of minors&apos;   houses.      As a result.of theshortage,  this coal could be provided only by cutting allocations to general housing needs.3. I am aware  that any further reduction of Gorman coal exports at this stage will meet with violent politicalreaction in France and the other Western European countries who depend upon the European Coal Organisation for theirallocation of coal.      In a good month&apos; the amount availableto the European Goal Organisation for allocation has been about 3*6 million tons.      In January they expect no more than.2 million tons,  the shortfall being made up of 2 million tons from U.S.A., 350,000 tons from Germany (in accordancewith the agreed reduction)  and 50,000 tons from Poland.      TheGerman contribution towards the January figure of 1.2 million tons will be about half the total.      I understand that already the French Authorities in Paris are preparing a strongdemarche against the maintaining of the 350,000 tons cut inJanuary and are seeking the  support of other European countriesin a united protest and. a demand that the 350,000 tons cut bereduced,  or alternatively that we should make a loan of coolover and above  the official allocation for January and untilthe American troubles are over.      The European GoalOrganisation are naturally seriously perturbed about theposition they will have to face in January even.if we make no further cuts.h. Notwithstanding this,  I consider that the seriousness of the situation which we have to face in the British Zone isparamount, and that, whatever the protests from othercountries who have so far benefited at the expense of british zone economy, wo should now decide:-(a) To oppose firmly any suggestion of any increasein the amount of coal to be.allocated for exportin January and succeeding months.

(b) To oppose equally firmly any proposals foloan to Prance or other European GoalOrganisation countries over and above theofficial allocations.(c) To approach the American Authoritiesimmediately and seek their agreement to a moratorium on exports or at least a furthsubstantial cut to operate from January.Control Office for Germany and Austria,Herfolk House.St.  Jame s&apos; s Squaro ,  S.&quot;&apos; /. 1.J.B.HV7TH DECELIE3ER,   19h7.
