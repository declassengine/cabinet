DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)1,secret COPY NO. &quot;CP. (U.6) U-5J+ &quot; &quot;(Also C.B.(U6) 9)11th december. I9h6.cabinettown aid country &quot;Planning bill memorandum by the Lord chancellor * My heller is that a scheme on the lines outlined inthe annex to this paper is greatly to be preferred to thescheme  laid down in the Bill.If you deprive a citizen of an asset, or part of anasset and concede that he is entitled to compensation,  thecompensation must surely be based (however much it may be discounted to allow for float) on the value of the asset or part asset when taken over.2. Unless you base your compensation on value youinevitably find that two citizens each of whom has been deprived of an asset of the value of  X will receivediffering sums by war/ of compensation.It is the differentiation which is so impossible tojustify;    better to pay nothing to anybody than to pay ahigh figure to one man and nothing to another.3. Let us suppose that Tom, Dick and Harry each own anacre of undeveloped land.    Each acre has a restricted(agricultural) value of  .50 and an unrestricted value of 1 ,050,  the   &quot;development value&apos; in each case being  1 ,000.Tom inherited the land under his father&apos;s will:    hisfather died in 1936.    We pay him&apos; 7* (see the  illustrationin paragraph 18,  page 8 of the Memorandum accompanying this bill).Dick bought the land in 193*. - We pay him  *1 G(i.e.   1,000 discounted for ten years as shown in the sameparagraph of the Memorandum).But Harry, who bought the - land, in 1918 is  to getnothing.h. I do not believe that any scheme based on theirrelevant considerations &quot;How and when did you come by thisland&quot; - instead of the only relevant consideration &quot;How muchwas it worth&quot; would stand up to criticism.

5. Accordingly,  although I bear full responsibility .forthe present proposals, having given them further consideration,I feel bound to make it clear that I cannot support them.6. It would be far easier to support a scheme involvingno compensation at all than to support the present scheme.If we are to dole out a vast sum of public money we must seethat it is distributed equitably,  and so as to work as littleinjustice 3.3 possible.7. I have sketched out an alternative scheme  in the annex.I make no claim for originality.     It is,  in substance,  theUthwatt scheme, eliminating his distinction between landwithin and land without towns, flavoured with extracts fromthe Coalition White Paper.    The principle of &quot;globalcompensation&quot; is since the Coal Bill firmly established.8. If it is possible to justify the figure I have taken( 250 million) by some calculation,  so much the better;    butan &quot;ex gratia&apos; payment does not need the same  justificationas a purchase price.Alternatively,  it might be thought better not toattempt to fix the figure until after five years.    This wasthe Coalition proposal.If, however,   it, is thought better - and there is muchto bo said for it - to fix the figure here and now I wouldmake these comments as  to the amount of the figure.9. Paragraphs 83 and 8k of the Uthwatt Report indicate the method which the Committee wanted to apply in fixing the global figure.10.        The Barlow Report which, unlAAe Uthwatt, applied both to lands inside and outside &quot;towns&quot;,  gave the figure of  kOOmillion as an &quot;intelligent guess&quot;  (quoted in paragraph 83 ofthe Uthwatt Report)  of the fair global figure-    though Ithink this figure did not include redevelopment values eitherinside or outside towns  (see paragraphs 251  and 25&amp; of theBarlow Report).Since then, however, building costs have risenenormously and the greater the cost of building the less thevalue of development right tends to be.Moreover,  it seems probable that the prospect ofdevelopment will be delayed;    this factor too reduces thevalue of the right.For these reasons I think we may claim to reduceBarlow&apos;s &quot;intelligent guess&quot;.But even if we have got to accept the full amount of kOO million. (I should on no account consider for a momentgoing above this figure) we must be careful to distributewhat we have got on an equitable and justifiable basis.11,        In conclusion,  I would point out that the scheme out-lined in the annex has the advantage of fixing a financialceiling or at least of enabling a financial ceiling to befixed in the future.    The scheme laid down in the Bill was originally estimated to cost  100 million and is now estimated to cost&apos; kOO million.    Estimates have been known to be exceeded.J.House of Lords. ,

ANNEXNo one may develop his land without consent.2.,: We recognize no right to compensation arising fromthis prohibition.    (See paragraphs 35 and 36 of the UthwattReport for the arguments  justifying this view).3. At the same  time we recognize that in those cases  inwhich consent is refused hardship would be caused.h. &apos;        A man to whom consent is given should stand in with hisless fortunate brother to whom consent is refused.5. We cannot tell .to-day to whom consent will be given andto whom it will-be refused.6. We therefore propose as an act of grace to make available the sum of  250 million as compensation to all landowners forthe deprivation, of their right to develop.7. This sum. will not be shared out until five years fromthe passing of the Act.    (N.3.    This five years delay was proposed in the Coalition Paper - see paragraph 30 of Cmd.  6537).8. In the meantime, we will establish machinery to assess the amount&apos;payable to- individual owners, (see paragraphs 97, 98and 99 of the Uthwatt Report as to this machinery).    The  total amount found due will be scaled down to the figure of  250million.9. Every landowner will then receive his appropriate shareof the compensation.    It might be found desirable to classifythe claims into two or more categories,- and to apply thescaling down less drastically to one category than another,thus taking care of land which is considered to be &quot;dead Ripe&quot;land.10.        It follows that ever:/ landowner whose land is compulsorily acquired by a Minister or public authority will get onacquisition a price based solely on current user.    He will havereceived, or will receive, compensation in respect ofdevelopment value out of his share of the 52.50 million.11.        If a landowner obtains permission to develop his ownland he should pay as a fee a sum ascertained by reference tothe difference between the value of the land restricted to itspresent user and the value of the land with a right to develop.This is only fair because he has already received or will receive his share of the  250 million.    (Logically he ought topay the whole difference because &quot;by receiving his share of the global figure he will have been paid for his development rights.The Coalition Government, however,  thought it wise to give him some inducement to develop his land or to make his landavailable for development).12.        If the land were sold for development the purchaserswould have to obtain the consent and pay the appropriatedevelopment charge.    This would prevent an owner fromrealising the full unrestricted value on a sale.
