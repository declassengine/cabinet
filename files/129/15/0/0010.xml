jHIS DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1946SECRETCP. (46) 444ith December, 1946CABINETSARAWAKMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies my colleagues will recall that Anthony Brooke, nephew of the former Rajahof Sarawak, actively opposed the cession of Sarawak to the Crown. . In recent weeks he has intensified his efforts to secure the restoration of the White Raj.He appears to be devoting most of his time and income to his campaign.2. His local contacts are two bodies known as the Malay National Union of sarawak and the Sarawak Dyak Association, both of which are at present smalland wholly unrepresentative. They have as their aim the restoration of Brookerule with Anthony Brooke or his father, Captain Bertram Brooke, as Rajah.They are in constant touch with Anthony Brooke. There is little doubt that theylook to him for leadership and inspiration. There is also little doubt that, butfor his active and persistent encouragement of their activities, opposition to-cession, which has hitherto been principally confined to Kuching itself,. would soon die a natural death.3. The local campaign, inspired by Anthony Brooke, has of late beenpointing to the political discussions with Malay leaders in Malaya as an indication of the results to be obtained by continued agitation. This has been coupled witha reference to a recent public announcement of Anthony Brooke &apos;s intention to challenge the validity of the cession before the Privy Council. This line has met with some success recently in Kuching, where a hardening of anti-cession feeling was reported about a month ago.4. I sent to the Governor of Sarawak, for publication locally, a messagedealing with the above points, and Sir Charles Arden Clarke has launched a campaign locally to counter the effects of Anthony Brooke&apos;s propaganda. But the-situation has recently been further complicated by Anthony Brooke&apos;s announce-ment of his intention to visit Sarawak. He applied to me, at the beginning ofNovember, for a priority air passage to Singapore, stating that he wished to visitfriends in Sarawak and also collect evidence for a forthcoming libel action. Irefused to sponsor this application as his reasons did not meet the normal criteria for the grant of priority. This does not mean, of course, that he is effectivelystopped from getting a passage by his own efforts.5. On learning of his intended visit, the Governor of Sarawak, after dis-cussion with the Governor-General, telegraphed that it was of first importance that the visit should be prevented. He proposed, subject to my approval, to make an order prohibiting Anthony Brooke from entering the territory on the grounds that (a) it can reasonably be inferred from Anthony Brooke&apos;s published state-ments that while in Sarawak he would attempt to foment opposition to cession,subvert the authority of Government, and indulge in seditious activities; (&amp;) heis a pretender to the throne, has publicly announced his intention of regainingit, and has taken active steps to increase his following in Sarawak; and (c) if he were to indulge in political activity in Sarawak, it is very probable that publicdisorder and a breach of the peace would result.6. The Governor has, however, also proposed an alternative course of action.He has suggested that, should it become known that Anthony Brooke has obtained a passage or has reached Singapore, or should he ask whether, assuming hecan make his own travel arrangements, he would be allowed to enter Sarawak.[32817]Copy No,   29
2he should be asked, on behalf of the Sarawak Government, to give an assurancein writing that if he is permitted to enter Sarawak, he will refrain from making any statement, oral or written, or from indulging in any activity, relative tothe status of Sarawak or the question of cession while he is in the territory.If he failed to give such an assurance, he would be warned that he will probablybe prevented from landing, or, if he landed, deported. If he gave such anundertaking and failed to abide by it, he would be deported or other appropriatelegal action would be taken against him. The Governor has expressed the viewthat if Anthony Brooke gave a satisfactory assurance on these lines, he mightsafely be permitted to enter Sarawak and to stay in the territory for so longas he faithfully observed his undertaking.7. Although Anthony Brooke&apos;s father, Captain Bertram Brooke, gave anundertaking (see Cabinet Conclusions (CM. (46) 29)) to accept the decision ofthe local Councils in the matter of the cession of the territory, this undertakinghas not been kept, and I have no confidence in Anthony Brooke keeping any undertaking he might give. In the first place, his avowed intention is to securethe reversal of the cession and the restoration of the White Raj. He wouldhave no other real object in visiting Sarawak than the attainment of this aim.Secondly, if he gave the assurance, it would be impossible to check whether ornot he was abiding by it faithfully or breaking the spirit of it whilst abidingby the letter. Thirdly, with the best will in the world, he would find it difficult,if not impossible, in view of his relations with the two Associations in Sarawakwhich have been carrying out his campaign, to adhere to his undertaking. Wemust, therefore, proceed on the assumption that, if the alternative course isfollowed and Anthony Brooke gives the undertaking, it will be necessary sooner or later to eject him from Sarawak, and the choice seems to lie between preventinghim from reaching the territory, and allowing him to go there with the virtualcertainty that the Governor will be obliged to eject him later on.8. Whereas the adoption of the first course might give rise to criticism both here and in Sarawak, which I think could be met in view of Anthony Brooke&apos;recent activities, the second might have much more serious consequences. Thepossibility of disturbances following a decision to deport him could not be excluded. There is, of course, a chance that, if the second course were adopted,Anthony Brooke would refuse to give the undertaking. This would place usin a strong position. But we cannot in my view bank on this possibility to theextent of taking it into account as a factor in deciding between the two courses.9. On the whole the balance of advantage seems to lie in preventing AnthonyBrooke from entering Sarawak, but, if my colleagues agree with me that thisis the right course, I propose to inform the Governor that the order shouldnot be made until we know that Anthony Brooke has succeeded in obtaining a passage for Sarawak, or he arrives at Singapore en route for the territory, orhe asks specifically whether he would be prevented from entering the territory.A.
