1; DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT   \ g printed for the Cabinet.   December 1946[SECRET Copy No...    2 9JCP. (46) 45910 December, 1946CABINETELECTRICITY bill memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power the proposals for the nationalisation of the electricity supply industrylontained in the draft of the Electricity Bill attached to this paper follow-generally the outline which was approved by the Cabinet on 18th July last(CM. (46) 69th Conclusions, Minute 6). The draft Bill was examined by the socialisation of Industries Committee on 13th December, who approved it subjectto various amendments which have now been incorporated. The Bill is to be presented &quot; in dummy &quot; before&quot;e the Christmas Recess and will be published inthe first half of January.This memorandum explains briefly those aspects of the Bill which are specialto this Industry, both in regard to organisation and to compensation and financial,jprovisions.Section A Scheme GenerallyPart 1- establishes the British Electricity Authority in which will be nested&apos;all the assets which will enable it to carry out the duty of generatingelectricity and supplying it in bulk to Area Boards, in whom tvillbe vested the distribution assets and whose duty will be to distributeto persons within their areas. The British Electricity authority is to be subject to general directions of the Minister, and is to havepower to co-ordinate the activities of the Area Boards and toexercise a general control over their policy.guiles of British Electricity AuthorityClause 1 (1) The duties of the British Electricity Authority (referred to-hereafter as &quot; the Central Board&quot;) include the development and maintenanceof an efficient, co-ordinated and economical system of electricity supply for GreatBritain. For that purpose the Board are to generate or acquire supplies ofelectricity and to transmit them to the Area Boards for distribution, and are3 co-ordinate the work of those Boards and exercise a general control over theirolicy. I propose that they should also have the duty of conducting research and of advancing the skill of their staff; these duties are shown as powers inCauses 2 (1) (c) and (d) of the Bill.Area Electricity BoardsClause 1 (2) I propose that there should be 14 Area Boards (apart fromhe North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board which will remain in a special position), who will distribute within their Areas.   For certain purposes and forMasons of economy and efficiency, supplies may be given outside the boundariesthe Area.$policy of BoardsClause 1 (6) This Clause lays it down that the policy of the Boards shalldirected towards achieving the four main requirements of an integratednational service, namely, economical generation by all methods, cheapening ofApplies and avoidance of undue preference, simplification of methods of charge..ai,d standardisation of supply, including fittings.
North of Scotland BoardClause 1 (7). The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board, which was established in 1943 and has duties in regard to the economic development and social improvement of the Highlands, will be reconstituted as a special form ofBoard responsible both for generation and distribution in the North of Scotlanddistrict which will be slightly expanded. It is given by this Bill new powersto enable it to function within the new framework.Additional Functions of BoardsClause 2. Defines the additional functions of the Central Board and theArea Boards. These are in the same general form as in the Coal Act includingpower to the Central Board to produce or manufacture anything required bythem or an)^ Area Board in connexion with their duties; as in the case of coal,some Electricity Companies have these powers, which should obviously thereforebe available to the Boards.Clause 2 (5). -For ease of working I have provided for the Central Board a power of delegation to the Area Boards, subject to the Minister&apos;s approval.Constitution of BoardsClause 3 (2). I propose that the Central Board should consist of a chairman and two other full-time members who will act as deputy chairmen, four part-time members and four Chairmen of Area Boards, serving part-time; the generalqualifications for these appointments are set out in the Clause. The Area Boardschairmen will be chosen in rotation, thus providing an essential link between the boards and integrating the whole industry. In addition, the Chairman of theNorth of Scotland Hj^dro-Electric Board will regularly serve as a part-timemember.Clause 3 (4). It is proposed that the Area Boards should consist of a full-time chairman, a full-time deputy chairman and not less than three nor morethan seven other part-time members with qualifications similar to the membersof the Central Board except that I here include &quot; capacity in local government&quot;to enable me to secure able men from local authorities who have distinguishedthemselves in the field of electricity. Among these part-time members will beincluded the chairman for the time being of the Consultative Council for theArea. The functions of the Consultative Councils are dealt with under Clause 7below. The constitution of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board is to be altered to conform with that of Area Boards.Distribution AreasClause 4- Having specified the Areas in a schedule to the Bill in broadterms, I propose that there shall be a deposited map on which the boundarieswill be shown in greater detail. Amendments to the Areas involving substantial changes will require an affirmative resolution of both Houses. In view of theinterest which will be shown during the Debate in the division of the countryinto Areas, I suggest that there should be published, simultaneously with theBill, a White Paper containing a schedule of the proposed Areas and a sketchmap accompanied by a brief statement of the grounds on which the Areas havebeen determined and certain Area statistics.Minister&apos;s Power of Direction, &amp;c.Clause 5 deals with the powers of the Minister in relation to the central board and follows generally the lines of preceding socialisation Bills.Clause 6 sets out the powers of the Central Board in relation to Area Boards.It should be observed that the Minister will only give directions to the central board, who will transmit them in suitable form to the Area Boards. nevertheless the Minister has the right to ask the Area Boards occasionally for such informa-tion as may be urgently required, e,g., for Parliamentary Questions.Consultative CouncilsClause 7 deals with the establishment of Consultative Councils, which willnot merely deal with consumers&apos; difficulties but will assist Area Boards incarrying out their duties by making suggestions and representations. the council&apos;s will consist of twenty to thirty persons of whom at least half will heappointed from amongst members of local authorities in the Area, with a view
to securing that there is no loss of local interest or knowledge. The remainingmembers will be representatives of the principal manufacturing, trading,agricultural and other interests, including Trade Unions. The Chairman will,as mentioned above, be ex officio a member of the Area Board and will thusprovide a necessary link between Council and Board. I am most anxious thatthese Consultative Councils should become a recognised and valuable part of theorganisation and for this reason I propose to appoint the members. ConsultativeCouncils will be empowered under Clause 7 (8) to set up local committees orappoint local representatives to assist them in covering their Area. I amproviding for each Consultative Council to prepare a scheme for local repre-sentation, which shall be submitted for my approval. Since the Areas will differ in character I have not laid down in the Bill what form the scheme shall take.The Bill provides at the end of Clause 7 (9) that the expenses of the consultative Councils shall be paid by the Central Board.Part II (Clauses 13 to 28) relates to the acquisition of Electricity Under-takings and covers the vesting of assets, compensation, control of dividends paid after trie introduction of the Bill, safeguarding of assets and the establishment of the Electricity Arbitration Tribunal.Acquisition of Electricity UndertakingsAll the undertakings concerned (including the Holding Companies) are tobe transferred to national ownership as going concerns, i.e., with all their assets and liabilities. In all 220 companies and 380 Local Authorities and PublicBoards will be concerned.The prime objective of these arrangements is to bake over, as far as is practicable, the Electricity Supply Industry as a whole and so avoid the disorgan-isation which any selective acquisition of assets would inevitably entail. this objective will be substantially achieved since the only section of the industry&apos;sstructure excluded is the few Holding Companies which have a minority financial interest only in electricity supply and are not themselves actual distributors. Onthe other hand, certain non-electricity activities will inevitably be included.These, however, are very small in relation to the industry and relate mainly to industries such as gas which are due to be nationalised.Frustration of ContractsClauses 13 (6) to 13 (8) cover the continuation of certain agreements of companies and of Local Authorities respectively, after vesting.Clause 15 relates to the rights of Boards to determine, after giving notice and subject to arbitration, certain agreements which they consider to be not reasonably necessary or made with an unreasonable lack of prudence.Compensation (in the case of Companies, &amp;c.)Clause 17 will provide for the payment of compensation by issue of british electricity Stock (Clause 32) to the holders of securities in Electricity Companies(including the Central Electricity Board and Joint Electricity Authorities) ina base period selected in agreement with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.In considering the various forms which compensation in the case of these companies might take, I was impressed by the need to find a practicable meansof taking over the Industry as a whole and as a &quot; going concern.&quot; My reasonsfor this were briefly:  (a) it is essential that the transfer to public ownership should be smoothand rapid in view of the magnitude and complexity of the Industry&apos;sdirect day-to-dayr transactions with the public;(6) financial control of the commercial side of the Industry is largely con-centrated in Holding Companies, many of which have no direct supplyresponsibilities, but should: not on that account alone, escapenationalisation.Moreover, as the Industry is substantially self-contained, a complete transferwould not be complicated in any material degree by the inclusion of enterprisesextraneous to electricity supply.
Consequently, I rejected any method of compensation.which, as in the caseof; the Coal Industry, would cover acquisition of physical assets only andconcentrated on three possible methods of compensating for a &quot; lock, stock andbarrel &quot; transfer, viz., .A.-On the basis of the Local Authorities statutory powers to acquire under-!takings at the end of a franchise period.B; -On the basis of the estimated net maintainable revenue of each concern.limited where appropriate by the franchise period.C. On the basis of the market value of shares.Fundamentally, Method A would involve assessing (a), the value of physicalassets at the end of the franchise and (6) the loss of income during the unexpiredperiod of the franchise. Neither (a) nor (o) would be possible until a solutionwas found to the difficult problem of determining an equated period of franchisefor the very many undertakings which operate under more than one franchise.Furthermore, a case could be made out that the value of the assets at the end ofthe franchise is the replacement value of the assets (there is one High Courtdecision to that effect on a tramway undertaking). That would give a large capital bonus to the companies. Assuming, however, a solution was found(a) would involve either accepting book values which because of variations inaccounting practice would be inconsistent and unsatisfactory, or a physicalvaluation requiring the diversion, from an industry badly in need of them, of alarge body of technical experts for a prolonged period. As to (b) the only feasiblebasis was found to be a return on the capital actually employed in the under-taking, (as distinct from capital raised), the ascertainment of which would undoubtedly be a complicated and contentious process. Finally, the Method a would not be applicable to those Holding Companies whose interests in electricity supply are only financial but whose acquisition, as an integral part of theindustry is desirable.In view of the numerous drawbacks to Method A, I was left with a choice between Methods B and C. Both of these could be adapted to meet the con-siderations mentioned above, and the decision which to select turned on therelative simplicity of the two methods and their respective cost. Method B, as has been recognised by the Official Committee on Socialisation of Industries, isan excursion into an unknown field since the prospective earning power of an industry is a matter of opinion. (SI (O) (46) 12, paragraph 13.) Compensationon this basis would have to be fixed by a Tribunal (or a number of Tribunals) andthe amount of compensation payable could only be determined after protractedand expensive hearings. Moreover, as electricity is a rapidly expanding industry,a Tribunal might award unduly inflated figures. Method C, on the other hand,is based on demonstrable facts and, except in respect of unquoted shares, couldnot be the subject of dispute or reference to Tribunals. In the electricity industry the proportion of unquoted shares is only about 7 per cent., and the objection raised on this score by the Committee is, therefore, not of materialsignificance to the present problem. From the standpoint of relative simplicityof operation, Method C undoubtedly holds the field. In regard to cost, it seemedvery unlikely, having regard to the prosperous and efficient past history of theElectricity Industry and its prospects for the future, that Method B would be appreciably less expensive than Method C.I therefore arranged an examination to be made of the Balance Sheets of&quot;a sample number of electricity companies and for the cost of compensation tobe estimated.   The results obtained may be summarised as follows :    million(a) nominal capital of all commercial undertakings includingHolding Companies which would be acquired ...      ...      188(b) nominal capital of, Companies included in sample ...      ...        47-6(c) estimate of compensation payable in respect of these contribute-panies on Method B ....   .....       ...      ...      ....      53-6(d) compensation payable on the basis of market value of sharesdeducting the financial assets which would be taken over,   .(Method C)    .........      ...      ...      ...      ...        53-7The calculation under Method B was based on earnings in 1937 and limited by the estimated period of, franchise. Having regard to the expansion of theindustry since. 1937 and.the possibility that franchises would be extended orrenewed., there is little doubt that in practice the.compensation awarded underthis Method would be considerably more than. the. estimate.       v
In these circumstances I feel sure that the balance of advantage lies withthe market value of shares basis in; that (a) it will enable compensation to bedetermined and paid with the minimum expenditure of time and labour and theminimum dislocation of the Industry; (5) it will be sufficiently flexible to enablemost concerns with a financial interest only in Electricity supply to be acquired;.c) it is unlikely to be more costly than the&quot; alternative methods.Compensation on the basis of Market Value will inevitably result in asubstantial loss of income to existing security holders. Assuming that compensa-tion stock will carry an interest rate of 1\ per cent., it has been calculated thatthe average security holder will lose about 40 per cent, of his present income.Unlike railways the incidence of the loss is fairly evenly spread over the various classes of security holder, the limits of variation being from 35 per cent, in thecase of Debenture Holders to 42 per cent, in the case of Ordinary Shareholders.Where securities are not quoted on the London Stock Exchange, the valueof the shares, failing agreement between a &quot;stockholder^ representative&quot; (see below) and the Minister, will be determined by the Electricity arbitration tribunal.Stockholder&apos;s RepresentativeClause 18. I think it prudent to ensure that the Boards of Directors of company Undertakings should cease to function on the Vesting Date.Consequently, I propose that every such body shall be dissolved on the vesting date (clause 13 (13) ).This precaution entails provision (clause 18) for the appointment by the holders of securities in those bodies, of a person to look after their interests.He will be responsible (a) for negotiating with the Minister regarding the value of unquotedshares (clause 7);(&amp;) for receiving British Electricity stock and for transmitting such stockto security holders in exchange for their securities (clause 19);(c) for payment to security holders of the permitted interest and dividendsafter vesting (clause 24).Consideration for vesting in the case of Local A uthorities and Joint BoardsClause 20. In lieu of compensation it is proposed in the case of LoGalAuthorities and Joint Boards that there should be provided by way of an issueof British Electricity Stock, or by periodical payment, sums sufficient to enablesuch Authorities to meet, after the Vesting Date, their obligations in respectof loans previously raised for the purpose of their Electricity Undertakings. Inthis way, the principle that their Undertakings should be acquired on a basis of net outstanding debt will be followed.I have not the slighest doubt that the Government will be strongly pressed for concessions when its terms are made public, especially where Local Authorities(fl) fear that capital expenditure incurred in respect of development work sub-sequent to 19th November, 1945 (when the Lord President announced the Govern-menfs intention to nationalise the industry), may not be fully recoverable underthe Bill; (&amp;) have made subsidies from their Electricity Undertakings towardsthe rates; (c) can show that the severance of their Electricity Undertakings fromtheir other activities has involved an increase in the burden of establishmentcharges remaining with the Local Authority.Clause 21. In regard to (a) I do not think there are likely to be many cases in which Local Authorities would in fact fail to secure full repayment of such expenditure, but to make absolutely certain a special clause has been drafted.In regard to (&amp;) and (c) I agree with my colleagues on the SocialisationCommittee that, in view of the Cabinet decision on the similar question in theTransport Bill, no reference should be made in this Bill to any additional com-pensation to Local Authorities at any rate at this stage.Control of Company DividendsClause 23 is designed(a) to restrict dividends payable on ordinary shares after the date of intro-duction of the Bill to the rate paid in respect of the previousaccounting period of the Company or 4 per cent., whichever is thehigher. Even so, such dividends are only payable if the net revenueearned is sufficient for the purpose;
(6) to prohibit payment of dividends on ordinary shares in respect of years for which no dividend was declared; !(c) to permit the recovery from compensation of any recent capital distribu-tion to the members of the Company. iWithout these precautions it might be possible for companies to. dissipateby the distribution of capital sums or excessive dividends, liquid resources whichshould vest in the new Board. -     : &apos; ,; Clause 24 relates to the arrangements under which the stock-holder&apos;s repre-sentative will be empowered to pay the permitted interest and dividends accruingduring the period.Dissipation of Assets of CompaniesClause 25 provides: a further safeguard against the dissipation of assetssubsequent to the date of introduction of the Bill. This clause permits anyBoard to make an application to the Electricity Arbitration Tribunal to reopentransactions made after 1st January, 1947, which appear to have been not reasonably necessary for the purposes of the undertaking or to have been madewith an unreasonable lack of prudence. The Tribunal is empowered to determine the extent of the loss caused and to make such orders as it thinks just againstparties to the transaction or persons who were Directors of the undertaking atthe time. If the enforcement of such orders is not possible, the Board maymake recovery by way of reduction in the compensation payable.Electricity A rbitration TribunalClauses 26 and 27 concern the Tribunal set up to determine questions ordisputes which under the Bill are to be decided by arbitration. The clausesfollow generally those adopted in the case of the Transport Arbitration Tribunal.Part III (clauses 29 to 39) covers the general duties and ppwers of the newBoards in financial matters, tariffs, borrowing powers, reservefunds, accounts, &amp;c.Financial Provisions ; 1 -The financial framework contemplated is broadly as follows : (a) The Central Board are charged with the duty of ensuring that theindustry as a whole pays its way for this purpose may give directions to Area Boards, e.g., requiring them to secure approval for all capitalexpenditure (clause 29).(b) The Central Board are free to fix their own charges for supplies ofelectricity to the Area Boards and have a substantial measure ofcontrol over the tariffs charged by Area Boards (clause 30).(c) The Centra! Board alone have power to borrow money by the issue of stock (Clause 31 (2)). They control temporary borowing by area boards (Clause 31 (1)) and fix the contributions of these Boards towardsthe interest and principal of stock (Clause 33). The stock raisedwill relate in part to the compensation paid for assets acquired, andthese assets will include generating assets (which vest in the central board) as well as distribution assets (which vest in the Area Boards).(d) The Central Board are required to make payments to meet the continuingobligations of Local Authorities in respect of their transferredelectricity undertakings, and the Area Boards are required to repayto the Central Board the proportion of these payments attributable to their Areas (Clauses 20 and 22).(e) The Central Board are required to establish a central reserve fundtowards which Area Boards are to contribute such sums as the central board determine (Clauses 35 (1) and (2)).(/) The Area Boards may, with the consent of the Central Board establisharea reserve funds and, out of surplus revenue only, are to contribute to those reserves such sums as are decided by the Central Board(Clauses 35 (3) and (4)).(g) The Minister has a general power of direction in relation to the central 1reserve fund and, through the Central Board, over the area reserve H&apos;v&apos;      funds (clauses 35 (2) and (4)). ,   .      i
(A) The Central Board may establish other reserves for replacements, &amp;c.Area Boards may do likewise with theconsent of the Central Board(clause 35 (5)). , - .(i) The Central Board have complete control over the disposal of surplusrevenues of the Central and Area Boards subject to the Ministersover-riding power of direction (clause 36).Thus the Bill places firmly on the Central Board financial responsibilityfor the nationalised industry and equips them with the powers essential todischarge that responsibility without, however, dictating the manner in which those powers are to be exercised, the detailed methods to be adopted by the board or the exact plan of management which they are to follow. The aim has been to provide the maximum of flexibility in the financial system.At the same time Area Boards are given an incentive to economical working in that they can establish out of their surplus revenues their own reserve funds.There is in the background the ultimate sanction of the Ministers powersof direction.Part IV -provides for certain duties of the Central Board in relation to supplies to railways and the use of waste heat from generating stations; it includes provisions relating to conditions of employ-ment, pension and compensation to staff and the common formClauses. It also provides for the dissolution in due course of theElectricity Commissioners and for the disposal of their property,rights, liabilities and functions.Railway SuppliesClause 40 lays on the Central Board the duty of supplying current forpurposes of railway haulage and traction, and provides for special approval bythe Ministers concerned of the terms of supply.Surplus HeatClause 41 lays on the Central Board the duty of investigating possible usesof surplus heat from generating stations and of assisting in research in thissubject. Hitherto this has not been one of the functions of an Electricityundertaking.ConciliationClause 42 provides in the normal way for proper conciliation machinery.Compensation for displaced staffClause 44 provides in accordance with Government policy for the making of Regulations governing the payment of compensation to persons who aredisplaced or disadvantaged as a result of reorganisations carried out underthe Bill.Dissolution of Electricity CommissionersClause 46 provides for the eventual dissolution of the ElectricityCommissioners and for all the consequences.E.
