(46) 105th Conclusions

A N N EXSITUATION IN BURMA&apos;Report by the Chiefs of staff as  instructed by the Cabinet at their 105thmeetings C.I.G.S.   has  consulted G. 0. C. , Burma,  on thepossibility of disorder in Burma and the militaryrepercussions of such troubles.      Our report is as follows.2. Should the Anti-Pas cist Peoples Freedom League(A.F.P. F.L.) resign from the Government of Burma, and large scale disorders ensue,  G.O.C., Burma, will require:-(a) the full use of all troops in Burma, both Britishand Indian, and a reinforcement of one Britishbrigade from outside Burma;or(b) if Indian troops, both fighting and administrativecannot he used, reinforcements of two Britishbrigades and British administrative troops from outside Burma.G.O.C., Burma, states that these reinforcements should beplaced in Burma before a crisis with ^. P&apos;. P.F.L.   isprecipitated,  as he considers that such a crisis would produce disorders in the&apos; country.3. The reinforcement of one British brigade, mentionedin paragraph 2(a) above, could he provided in Burma in about three weeks&apos;  time, without material effect upon theRelease Scheme and with the acceptance of some riskselsewhere in Asia.      The second British brigade, mentionedin paragraph 2(b) above,  could be provided by indefinitedeferment of the run-down of 2 Division,  thereby materiallyaffecting the Release Scheme during 1947:    there would alsobe repercussions on India as the return of some of hertroops,  now overseas, would have to be halted.Alternatively,  a brigade could be withdrawn from india-    we understand that&apos; in view of the critical stateof affairs in that country,  the Viceroy would stronglyoppose this.

h. The crucial factor, however,  is the availability of administrative troops.      British administrative troops to replace the Indian administrative units in Burma donot  exist;    and without the necessary administrative unitsthe army could not operate effectively.5. The military issue is therefore whether we  canuse  Indian troops in Burma or not  in the event of disorder.If we can, then the situation can be held.      If we cannotuse  Indian troops,  then we cannot meet the military requirements of the situation, particularly in administrativetroops.(Signed)      TEDDERJ.H.D.   CUNNINGHAMMONTGOMERY OP ALAMEIN
