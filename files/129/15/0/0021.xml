-    141;S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.   (46) 45517TH DECEMBER,  1946CABINETTOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING BILLMemorandura by the Lord Chancellor and the Ministerof Town and Country planning in accordance with the conclusions of the Cabinet onthe 12th December (CM. ...(46) 105th Meeting) we circulate herewith a revised draft of Part IV of the Bill.The revised draft provides (Clause 50) for the payment ofa stated global sum by the way of compensation, and for thedistribution of that sum in accordance with a scheme to bemade by the Treasury which will require affirmative approval,by both Houses of Parliament.    The clause gives the Treasury&apos;acomplete discretion as to the distribution of the global sum,so that compensation can. be paid either at a flat rateproportionate to the &quot;development values&quot; of interests entitledto compensation or at differential rates according to different circumstances affecting those interests.The clauses contemplate that the scheme will not be made until the necessary information has been obtained inaccordance with regulations to be made under clause 51.    Thisclause in turn gives wide discretionary powers, under whichdevelopment values may be established either by administrativedecisions of the Central Land Board (working through the valuation Office) or by reference to arbitration.The remaining clauses reproduce with only minor amendmentsthe clauses contained in Part IV of the Bill as previouslyprinted which deal with the satisfaction of compensation by the&quot;issue of stock and the exclusion of small claims..The global figure to be inserted in sub-section (2) of clause 50 is under consideration by the Chancellor of theExchequer.    The figure will have to cover compansation payable under the corresponding Scottish Bill, and provision is madeby the sub-section for enabling the Treasury to make the -necessary apportionment between the two countries.The Cabinet may wish to consider whether it is desirableto describe the share in the global figure (as in sub-section(l)  of clause 50) as &quot;compensation&quot;, in view of the fact, thatit is proposed to present these provisions as being in thenature of an ex gratia payment.(Intld) J.L.S.COPY NO.17TH DECEMBER,   1946.
