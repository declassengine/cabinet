November 1946.63&apos;CRETp, (46) 436tk November, 1946Copy No.  2 9CABINETTJPPLEMENTARY REPORT OF THE TRIPARTITE NUTRITIOrsCOMMITTEENote by the Chancellor of the Duchy of LancasterAT the Cabinet meeting held on 7th November, 1946 (CM. (46) 95th Con-jsions, Minute 1), I referred to a report made confidentially by the Britishbriber of the Tripartite Nutrition Committee to the Deputy Military Governorter the Commission^ last tour.I circulate certain extracts from this Report Which may be of interest tocolleagues.J. B. H.(Initialled)Norfolk House, St. James&apos;s Square, S.W. 1,28th November, 1946.Extracts from Supplementary Report on Fifth Tour of TripartiteNutrition Committee1. On previous tonrs, the Committee had been better served in the Americand French zones than in the British zone with appropriate documents andrds concerning the state of health and nutrition, to form a background toeir investigations. On this occasion, however, we were presented with anmirable selection of records and charts at the meetings with the COG.thorities in Hamburg, Hannover and Dusseldorf.2. The French also presented good dossiers, but the Americans failed to do this was only one of many incidents that together gave me the clearpression that the United States authorities are not in as good a position to port on conditions in their zone as they were three months ago.3. The tour provided an opportunity to bring into fair perspective theflrk of the Nutrition Survey Teams.In the British zone the organisation of the work of the team has progressedp, so far as their activities in the field are concerned. The British teams arecruiting suitable Germans to assist in making investigations. Great care isen in the selection of this personnel and in its training, so as to provide the^leus of a German organisation, should one be required when there is no&quot;jerneed for C.C.G. to maintain direct control of nutritional investigations.A very different picture is seen in the American zone.   There, some sixpnths ago, no less than nine survey teams, staffed mainly by United States armyrsonnel, were operating.   There was centralised control.   At that time, theimports on the state of nutrition in the towns of the United States zone were,^en as a whole, trustworthy.   Unfortunately, decisions to reduce the scope ofese investigations and rapid redeployment of the personnel engaged in makingiem have led to a large proportion of the work being handed over to Germans,IP with a few exceptions, have not been adequately trained for th - purpose.[32775]
The quality of the work has deteriorated to a very serious extent already and thefuture of it looks even more discouraging. . I formed, the opinion that theexaminations were being carried out in so slipshod a manner as to make the datauseless.4. One cannot fail to be impressed in travelling through the American zone(also the French zone) with the large proportion of pasture and uncultivatedland. Conversations with American Food Officers lead me to believe that they now recognise that their efforts to persuade farmers in their zone to plough upgrassland for crop production have failed. There has been, apparently, littleeffort made, other than to try by persuasion, to accomplish a big increase of arable land.5. Nothing illustrates better the decline in the quality of the survey workin the United States zone than the reports we were given in Stuttgart andMunich that the calorie equivalence of food acquired outside the rations was notgreater than 40-50 a day for the ordinary consumer. We were told in all serious-ness that these estimates must,be correct because data obtained by the nutri-tional teams had been confirmed by independent checks carried out by Food and agriculture Officers.The relatively good physical state of the people in those towns made it quite impossible to accept these statements.6. For what it is worth, I wish to record a strong impression during thistour that the efficiency of operation of the British Element of the C.C.G. con-cerned with Food and Agriculture and with Public Health has increased duringthe past few months.  It seemed to me to be apparent in every direction.In strong contrast there is evident a very serious decline in the efficiencywith which the United States authorities are handling their problems in these fields.
