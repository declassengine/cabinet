JIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OF  HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 19469 secret Copy No. ^ &apos;c.p.. (46) 45310* A December, 1946CABINETSHIPPING policy memorandum by the Minister of transport. At the meeting of the Cabinet * on 15th October I was invited to submit a memorandum covering,: :(A) The present level of freight rates and the possibility of reducing them;(B) Steps which could be taken to recover our carrying trade; and(C) Age and quality of our Merchant Fleet.A. Freight Rates2. Until the end of February of this year, all Allied merchant shipping was subject to control by the United Maritime Authority. This control covered thenature and the terms and conditions of employment. The rate of freight in any trade was determined for all ships engaged therein on the basis of the costs of operation of the various flags, in the U.M.A. pool of shipping. ,3. These rates were generally applicable in world trade while UM.A.control existed. Since then there has been no international control of rates of freight, but the marginal supply of tonnage is determined by the policy of theUnited States Government which limits the volume of tonnage available forchartering in a free market, and world market in Freights is therefore largelybeing determined by the operation of the factor of demand in conditions of anartificially restricted supply.4. British shipping remains, as to employment and freight, under thecontrol of my Department. The control over liners is exercised through a systemof licences to operate in specified trades. Tramp ships operate under voyagelicences and in practice are mainly &quot;directed&quot; to employment, i.e., each ship isrequired to fix for a specified voyage with a specified Charterer.5. Where a ship is so directed, the freight rate and terms of the charterhave also to be determined. For this purpose freight rates for all main tradeshave been scheduled. These rates are fixed on a &quot; costed &quot; basis, following theexperience of the United Maritime Authority, and, despite the continuance of highfreight levels in the world market, the rates for British ships engaged in our import trades have been periodically reduced as opportunity offered. A further reduction was in course of consideration when the Cabinet last discussed thematter and, has now been made effective. The current rates in some importantimport trades, compared with those in operation under the United MaritimeAuthority, are shown in Annex A.6. The scheduled rates for British ships remain very substantially in excessof pre-war rates. This results directly from the general rise in the level of prices,which has enormously increased the costs of maintaining and operating merchant ships. Bunker costs have risen steeply and the cost of repairs is double pre-warcost. Stevedoring and port charges are much higher, and the time taken for repairs as well as for loading and discharging is far longer than under pre-war conditions. Crews&apos; wages still include a war-risk bonus of  10 per man per month and this will continue till agreement is reached between the two sides ofthe industry on a consolidated wage.* CM. (46) 86th Conclusions, Minute 1.[32850] b
one of the most important factors in adding to the cost of freight on our bulk&quot;imports is the absence of coal for export, which results in a ballast voyage out-wards for the vast majority of our tramps, whereas before the war outward coalcargoes helped to defray the cost of the voyage. The allowance for the cost ofthese ballast voyages in our freight calculations substantially increases the rateof freight necessary on the homeward voyage. Moreover, many French andScandinavian vessels which would otherwise be released for general employment are   engaged in long hauls of coal from America. Thus the cost of many elementsthat go to make up a rate of freight is determined by the economic conditions inthis country and abroad.7. While it is important to take every opportunity of adjusting rates of freight for our ships engaged in our import trades, British scheduledrates must in pi*esent circumstances be high in relation to those prevailingbefore the war, nor can they be regarded in complete isolation fromthe rates we have to pay for foreign shipping. There are many bidders&quot;besides ourselves for tonnage&apos;on the market, while the European maritimecountries formerly offering tonnage for charter are themselves short ofships! It is in these circumstances the United States tonnage which establishesthe general level of freights on the market. United States operating costs arevery high;, and the rates established by the United States authorities are morethan 50 per cent, above our rates for directed tramp voyages. While I have beenable to take up some privately operated United States tonnage below the officialUnited States rate, the United States costs of operation establish a minimummuch above our own scheduled rates, and, so long as we and other bidders remaindependent upon United States tonnage, there can be little prospect of substantial reductions, in world freight levels generally. .....8.. Payment of higher freight rates to foreign flag ships than to our ownships in the same trade is an unsatisfactory feature of the present situation. its long continuance would adversely affect the prospects of our shipping,&apos; in that thefinancial resources of the foreign owner&apos; whose costs? are near our own (e.g., theScandinavians) would be strengthened compared with those of our own industry,and his power to equip himself with up-to-date tonnage would be so much thegreater. The cost of replacing lost tonnage is. twice as; much as before, the war,and current, freight earnings, for British and foreign owners, are of. the utmostimppctance, in; relation to the prospects far immediate, and future building,. our losses, during the war were absolutely and relatively greater than that of any ofour Allies, so that the cost of replacement is so much the more important for us.9.. Freight rates on timber were mentioned particularly at the. meetingon 1,5th October (CM. (46). 86th Conclusions). Eor the Baltic trades we have, onlylimited numbers of suitable British ships. The trade, was largely in the hands ofScandinavian owners before the- war, and the rates for this tonnage; a,t present-are high. I have directed, into the. trade less suitable British ships, and the terms-of charter have to provide for these. The use of ocean-going tramps in this trade, though it has been necessary, to lift the programmes, is uneconomical, asthe loading and discharging time is out of all proportion to the sailing time.: If we want more foreign ships in this special trade -as undoubtedly we do ifwe are to maintain our coastal and other short sea services we&apos;must pay the ratesand accept conditions necessary to attract them. The actual freight ratesmight be capable of reduction if the terms of charter could be brought more; into line with those prevailing in other trades, e.g., as regards time in port.10. The cost of carrying our imports is substantially increased by theoperation of factors other than the level of freights. Though the wartime risks of&quot; interruption of shipping no longer exist, the importing Departments still tendto expect import programmes to be covered commodity by commodity and area byarea to a monthly target. In order to achieve this target, ships have often to beused in an uneconomical way, by direction to long ballast voyages. Again, I amfrequently: asked by Ministers responsible for imports to keep ships waiting to load in ports abroad until cargo is available. Under present conditions, in manyloading areas, where labour troubles prevent the working of ships or delay the arrival of cargo for loading, where Governments frequently embargo exportsat short notice, where internal transport difficulties hold up. the flow of goods for loading, this all too often involves our ships in inordinate&apos; delay, and (apart fromthe loss of shipping availability) greatly adds to the cost of our imports. no action of ours can remove all these difficulties, but some economy in the use ofour shipping (and consequently in the cost of our imports) could be obtained if
I had. latitude to adjust shipments over somewhat longer periods, say over-quarterly instead of over monthly periods. With greater flexibility of allocation \ r] Cof our; tonnage resources I might hope. to make more economical use of our-tonnage-though no amount, of skill in allocation could reduce the serious loss oftime and money resulting from lack of cargo., as at present., in practically all the-main loading areas at once.11. We cannot afford to add to our difficulties by losing time in bur ports, inloading or discharging, or in the repair yards. It is estimated that the time spentloading and discharging in United Kingdom ports is about 50 per cent, longer than in 1939. Suitable propaganda in connection with the production drive,directed to dock workers of all kinds and the authorities concerned, might bringsome beneficial results.12.   I summarise as follows : (1) The directed rates of freight for British tonnage are on a &quot; costed &quot; basis.They have been kept under review arid reduced as opportunity offered,&apos; with special reference to cheapening our bulk imports. They reflectnecessarily the high cost of operation, and of labour afloat and ashore,and the lack of coal for export. They are nevertheless markedly belowthe rates ruling for foreign ships.(2) The disparity between British directed rates and the world market&apos; freights cannot be continued indefinitely without adverse effect uponthe competitive power of our shipping in the future.(3) Economy in the cost of shipping our imports could be secured if I hadlatitude as to the period during which the programmes for particular-commodities and areas could be lifted, say quarterly periods insteadof monthly as at present.  For this latitude I ask.(4) Appeals to dock workers, ship repairers, &amp;c, in connection with theproduction drive might help to improve &quot; turn round &quot; time in homeports and thus reduce both shipping costs and our dependence uponforeign shipping. :*B. Recovery of our Carrying Trade13. The rate of recovery of our carrying trade is limited by our shortage oftonnage. Primarily this is a question of the amount of tonnage that for thetime being We can afford to allocate to trades other than those to territories for-which we have a responsibility to provide tonnage for imports. While everyeffort is being made to restore our carryings in these so-called &quot; cross trades,&quot;the amount of tonnage that we can spare is limited. Primarily our resourceshave to be concentrated on the carriage of our own imports and those of territories,including India, for which we are responsible, and even with this concentrationwe have to rely extensively upon United States shipping, which is very expensive..In limiting the amount of tonnage in &quot; cross trades &quot;we lose earnings of foreign exchange and our competitors are enabled to establish themselves in the trades,in a favourable position as compared with British owners in so far as Britishowners may find it impossible, with the tonnage available to them for the purpose,,to renew or retain their old connections. It will be hard to dislodge these foreign competitors once they have been established.14. Additional foreign tonnage would have to be drawn primarily from american resources. I should prefer to review the whole problem in relation to-the general problem of United States shipping in our service on which I sub-mitted a paper to the Cabinet on 8th October (CP. (46) 375). Since then negotiations?-tions have been taking place with the Canadian and United States Governmentand it will he necessary for me to submit a further paper with proposals as toour course of action.C. Age and Quality oe our Merchant Fleet15.   The position is set out in Annex B. which includes statistical tables.The principal facts which emerge are : (i) Apart from the problem of replacing war losses, we have to provide forthe replacement of a large amount of tonnage which is or will rapidlybecome obsolescent.   Nearly 2 million gross tons of our non-tanker[32850] b 2
fleet is over 25 years of age compared with 1-25 million gross tonsin 1939, despite the fact that the total volume of our non-tanker fleethas fallen from 14 million to 10 million gross tons. Our ships havebeen pushed hard during the war and many of them are sufferingapart from age, from hard wear and lack of adequate maintenance,(ii) The proportion of ocean-going bulk carriers in our cargo fleet is much higher than pre-war since most of our wartime building was necessarilyof this class. We have more ocean-going tramps in the 5,000 to10,000-tons group than we had before the war. The purchase of american ships of similar type, although it might prove necessaryfor our immediate purpose, would accentuate this disparity. Wecannot afford to perpetuate this feature. The future prosperity ofour shipping lies especially with the specialised types and of these weare still short. As regards ocean-going liners, there is an extensivebuilding programme already under way on behalf of the interestedowners. We are likely to suffer a shortage of intermediate and handy-ships, especially those suitable for the Baltic and short sea trades, forin this class there is no immediate sign of building activity on anyscale by British owners.A.

ANNEX BAge and Quality of the United Kingdom Merchant Fleetg   &apos;Information relating to the age and constitution of the United Kingdomnl Merchant Fleet is given in the attached tables. The tables are confined to shipsy on the United Kingdom register excluding foreign and Canadian vessels on9 bareboat charter or on requisition^I       Table I shows, in respect of ships 1,600 G.T. and over, the age of the fleetI \ in 1946 and 1939.  It will be seen that while the proportion of ships over 25 yearsf I old has increased sharply, so has that of ships under 10 years old.  Thus, whereas the total non-tanker fleet has been reduced from 13 m. to 10 m. gross tons, thee j amount over 25 years of age has increased from about 1J m, gross tons to nearly? 2: m. gross tons, and is 19 per cent, of the total.   On the other hand, half our j present fleet in this class is less than 10 years old against only a third in 1939.i1  This reflects the effect of war losses and building.   Our building during the warr was mainly of tramp ships of standard design; as a result, nearly 60 per cent.1 of our dry cargo tonnage under 5 years old is of tramp type.  There is a compara-tive shortage of newer ships of the liner type.  The total liner fleet, i.e., passengerships, passenger/cargo ships and cargo liners has fallen from 9^ m. gross tons to 6-ij m. gross tons.  As a consequence of this the proportion of tramp-type shipsrunning on liner berth is higher than pre-war.  This distortion is gradually beingadjusted in the new building programme, in which liner types predominate.The constitution of the present tanker fleet has not changed significantlyfrom that of the pre-war fleet, mainly owing to the comparatively rapid increasein the tanker fleet before the war, leading to a fleet which was substantiallyyounger on the whole than that of the non-tanker fleet.Table II gives similar statistics to those shown in Table I, but in respectof the smaller ships, 500-1,599 g.t. the main feature is the increased tonnage over25 years old. New ships are fewer than pre-war, but a large number of smalltankers was built for direct war purposes. ,Table III.-The analyses of the present fleet by type and speed, with corresponding figures for 1939. The speed of each type has increased significantly,but the overall speed has not increased to the same extent owing to the increasein proportion of tramps whose speed is less than that of liners.Table IV. Analyses of the present fleet by type and size and giving compara-tive figures for the 1939 fleet. This also reflects the results of war losses and special war building. The war building was largely confined to bulk carriers,i.e., tramps of over 5,000 g.t., and the amount of tonnage of this type has increased from 1\ m. gross tons to nearly 2% m. gross tons. Tonnage in the 3,000-5,000 g.t.tramp type fell from nearly 2 m. gross tons to f m. gross tons. There is, inconsequence, a shortage of handy ships.To summarise, some 50 per cent, of the pre-war fleet was lost during the war,the losses being spread over ships of all types and sizes. These losses were tosome extent made good by new building, mainly of large bulk carriers. Olderships could not be scrapped, and there is thus a greater proportion of ships over25 years old than in the pre-war fleet. In the result we have more large bulkcarriers than before the war, while there is a definite shortage of intermediatetramps and of liner types of all sizes, and the proportions of both newly builtships (under 5 years old) and old ships (over 25 years old) are abnormally high.The low proportion in the group between 10 and 15 years old reflects the slumpconditions of the early &apos;30s.The tables give such information about the age and constitution of the fleetas can be presented statistically, but quality cannot really be so presented. Thereis no doubt that the great majority of British ships are good ships, able to compare with the ships of any flag in seaworthiness, soundness of construction and in crewaccommodation. There is a high proportion of old ships and these will go out! of service as the position eases. The standard wartime types are useful carriersfor many purposes, but may not prove, a few years hence, competitive with shipsbuilt to peacetime specifications. The only other respect in which the quality ofour fleet need cause concern is the dearth of intermediate sized ships and shipsspecially constructed for particular trades. Most owners believe that the futurelies largely with specialised ships, and that the scope for the general tramp, whichI is reasonably suitable for many trades but highly suitable for very few, willdiminish.The other aspect of quality on which comment is required, is the present condition of the fleet.   The war has left us with a heavy backlog of repairs and
reconditioning; ships have been used hard and often for trades for which theyare not well adapted; this was necessary during the war and is still necessary.Shipowners are anxious to get their ships back into first-class condition, but theyare limited by the non-availability of facilities, and it must be some time yet beforethe deferred repairs and accumulating reconditioning can be worked off. It isimportant that shortages of labour and materials should not hold up this programme.TABLE IAge of United Kingdom 1948 Merchant Fleet (1600 G.T. and Over) andComparison . with 1939 Fleet1946 Fleet.
