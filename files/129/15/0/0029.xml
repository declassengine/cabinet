At their meeting on the 10th December, 1946,  theCabinet invited me to submit my considered view on thelegal implications of the proposal that commanding officers of His Majesty&apos;s ships should be given authorityto arrest on the High Seas certain specified immigrants to Palestine - CM.(46) 104th Conclusions (5).2. I have consulted with the legal adviser to theForeign Office and with representatives of the Admiralty.The question of the right of a State to search and arrestforeign vessels on the high seas has arisen several timesduring the last 140 years - in connection with the SlaveTrade in the early part of last century and more recentlyin connection with liquor running into the United States.Those who asserted the existence of the right have generallygiven way;  and I do not think that it can be supported onany general principle- of International Law.     The casesshow clearly that the right of visit and search is abelligerent right, not to be exercised in time of peaceexcept by virtue of some treaty,,      The most which can besaid juridically in favour of the action proposed by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty is that in certain instancesit could be  justified on grounds of self-preservation.    Ifit could be  shown that a particular ship carryingimmigrants was loaded with arms and ammunition, we might attempt to justify our action before an international court on the ground that the importation of the arms andammunition would lead to civil war,      I think we should be most unwise, however, to attempt to rely on the presumedexistence of a right of this kind - the implications ofwhich are exceedingly uncertain.3, For the reasons mentioned,  I am of the clear opinionthat the action proposed cannot be justified in InternationalLaw.      I am not concerned in this Note to suggest what our policy sh8uld be in the circumstances;    but I would observe that we are at present seeking to rely on the principles ofInternational Law in other fields,  and that we  should

consider carefully what reactions our policy in thisrespect is likely to have elsewhere.      In particular it has been suggested that we should consider further whether or not to inform the Americans of our intentions;the history of this matter,  and the decided cases, Showclearly how sensitive the Americans are to any attemptto assert rights inconsistent with the general principles.J.17th December, 1946.
