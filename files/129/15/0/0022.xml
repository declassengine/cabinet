iINDIAN policy memorandum by the Prime minister the India and Burma Committee have had a series of meetings with theViceroy since the departure of the Indian representatives.2. It is still possible that the Muslim League may co-operate in theRConstituent Assembly, but the prospects of this are not hopeful. Whether theyTKwill do so or not should be known by the end of January.3. The Viceroy has strongly urged the necessity for having in readiness a^definite policy, to be iannounced and declared if and when it becomes clear thatijhe Muslim League will not attend the Constituent Assembly, and therefore thatifthere is no prospect of a Constitution being framed with the consent of all partiesJor in accordance with the Cabinet Mission&apos;s statement of 16th May.4.   The Viceroy has given us the following estimate of the situation : s(a) We are not in a position to maintain British rule in India beyond31st March, 1948, and possibly not for so long.(b) Our present authority in the country has inevitably declined owing toour announced intention to hand over power to India. Those Indianswho used to support us loyally have felt compelled in self-defence totransfer their allegiance to one of the political parties or simply to lie low. Similar considerations have strongly affected Indian membersof the secretary of State&apos;s services, and the British members are few,148j qfcC0lA7SD....&amp;ffiOtITHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.

2tired and dispirited by political opposition As a result we cannot, incertain provinces at any xate, maintain the administration if theCongress withdraws its co-operation.(c) As a consequence the Viceroy and Governors cannot resist any demand of Congress, however extreme, on which the Congress are preparedto resign. This, the Viceroy considers, is not a position which canlong continue. We may at any time be involved in what is virtuallycivil war between Hindus and Muslims.(d) No improvised measures to cover a short period of years can amend this situation.5. The alternatives are therefore to withdraw from India or to reassertour authority. Withdrawal would have to be a phased process spread over about12 months. The Viceroy does not say that the latter course is totallyimpossible. He considers that it can only be done if we declare our determina-tion to govern India for a further period of at least 15 years. This isnecessary if we are to retrieve the allegiance of Indian Government servants and secure support from moderate Indian citizens. Extreme measures would benecessary. The Viceroy would also require British military reinforcements of4 to 5 divisions. The Committee considered that this course was politicallyimpracticable.   Apart from this the British troops are not available.6. The Viceroy proposed to us a plan of which the following are the main features: (a) That,,, whatever may happen as regards Muslim co-operation in theConstituent Assembly, we should announce our intention to withdraw from India.(b) That we should announce that we should do this over a period by stages,and that as the first stage we should withdraw from the four SouthernProvinces. This would mean withdrawing the British Governors, theSecretary of State&apos;s Services, and those United Kingdom nationals; who wish to leave.(c) The later stages would have to be planned in the light of developments.If the impact of the announcement caused the parties to reach an Iagreement we should be able to hand over the Central Government Iintact. If not we should hand over the Hindu Provinces to a govern-1ment set up by the Constituent Assembly, and the Muslim majority jProvinces to the Provincial Governments. The Indian Army wouldbe kept intact as long as possible but might have to be divided in the 1final stage.7.   The advantages the Viceroy saw in this proposal were : (a) The Congress threat to withdraw co-operation would be greatly weakenedby the withdrawal of British authority from the four SouthernProvinces. It would not then be in Congress interests to refuse to govern these.
(I)) The British civil servants and troops withdrawn would be available tostrengthen the administration in Northern India. The problem of protecting our nationals in extreme disturbances would be reduced and concentrated.(c) The psychological effect of visible withdrawal might induce the majorparties to come together before our final departure.1*    (d) The defence of India&apos;s frontier would be secure up to the time of our&quot; final withdrawal.8. The Committee, advised by the Lord Chancellor, considered that acomplete demission of authority in Provinces in India could not be undertaken without legislation; that legislation when undertaken must provide for the wholeprocess of handing over power; that it would not be possible to frame andintroduce such legislation in January 1947 owing to the legislative programme and to the uncertainties as to the authorities to whom power would finally betransferred.9. On the other hand they were impressed with the seriousness of thepossible developments which the Viceroy envisaged, and also with the possibility that an early announcement of our intention to withdraw from India was themost hopeful means of inducing the Congress and the Muslim League to come toan agreement.10.   The Gommittee&apos;s conclusion was that a statement in the terms in the annex to this memorandum should be made in Parliament so soon as it becomes, clear that the Muslim League will not come into the Constituent Assembly, which will probably be by the end of January.11. The intention is that after this statement has been made the Viceroywould begin the process of withdrawing British civil servants, troops and thoseUnited Kingdom nationals who wish to leave from the Southern Provinces. TheConstitutional responsibility would, however, be retained in form and the BritishGovernors would remain in Office. They would, of course, become powerless toact otherwise than on Ministerial advice. In the autumn legislation would be promoted to authorise the final withdrawal. The Viceroy is prepared to accept this alternative in the circumstances.12. The adoption of these proposals raises a difficulty in regard to the con-Itinuance of the Paramountcy relationship with certain Indian States. It is anligation of the Crown under its relationship with the States to prevent politicalpenetration of the States by hostile elements in British India and to protect theState Government against internal disruption by revolutionary activity withinthe State. The first is only capable of fulfilment so long as there is effectiveBritish control of the surrounding territory in British India which willincreasingly cease to be the case in respect of States in Southern India. Internalprotection is provided by military or police assistance, and in certain cases,notably Hyderabad, we are under Treaty obligation to maintain troops under british control in the State. It is not a possible position to maintain British[32903] b 2
troops in States and allow them to be used to resist infiltration from British!India, where the congress which encourages such action against the States is in office with our approval.    It may therefore become necessary to terminate the!Paramountcy relation with States in the south, such as Hyderabad and Mysorebefore the final transfer of power.   Paragraph 8 of the draft Statement is]designed to leave the way open for this.C. E. A. I10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,2ith December, 1946.
annex draft statement i 1. His Majesty&apos;s Government greatly regret that it has not yet proved&apos;possible to bring within the Constituent Assembly in India all the major sections0f Indian opinion and that the Muslim League, in particular, still find themselvesunable to join in its deliberations.2. When the suggestion was made, in 1942, and again in 1946, that thefuture of India should be settled in this way by Indian representatives it wastoped that the transfer of power in India would not be delayed and that itwould be accomplished within a reasonably short period after the end of the war.3. In order to accord with this expectation His Majesty&apos;s Government haverefrained from proceeding with the recruitment of the Secretary of State&apos;services, which had been in abeyance for the greater part of the war.4. There is to-day no question of retaining the responsibility of the british parliament for Indian matters indefinitely.5. His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore believe that it is their duty both to their own countrymen and to the Indian people to state now their definiteintentions as to the future. It is their intention to recommend Parliament to handover power in India by 31st March, 1948, and they trust that in the intervening period before that time the various Indian communities will be able to come to asatisfactory arrangement as to the future Government of India.6. The return of those Europeans who will no longer be serving in India andof any others who desire to leave the country under the changed circumstances will occupy some considerable time and will, therefore, have to be begun somemonths before the date given, 31st March, 1948, and it will proceed by stages.7. Though preparatory measures will necessarily have to be taken, HisMajesty&apos;s Government do not contemplate that it will be necessary on that account to recommend to Parliament any amendment of the existing constitu-tion, or that legislation will be required otherwise than to authorise the finaltransfer of power.8. Similarly in the case of the Indian States, though it is not intendedto bring Paramountcy, as a system, to a conclusion earlier than the date of theinal transfer of power, it is contemplated that there may be such adjustmentsi the relations of the Crown with individual States as may be mutuallyitceptable.9. If the conditions of the offer made in May 1946 are carried out by a constituent Assembly representing all the major communities, His Majesty&apos;sjovernment will recommend Parliament to hand over authority to the indian government that is set up under the new constitution.
10. If, on the other hand, any less representative Constituent Assembly!should formulate an ultimate constitution, or if the conditions as to the handinjover of power laid down in May 1946 are not satisfied, His Majesty&apos;s Govern!ment will be forced to reconsider the matter and will recommend the hiandinJover of power to such Governments as appear to them to be representative offthe different areas of the country.11. They earnestly hope that in the light of this definite decision the rep re Jsentatives: of the various Indian communities will between them reach ailacceptable arrangement for the future of their country in time to avoid thJdislocation and dangers that must otherwise ensue.
