(46) 461llth December, 1940Copy No. 29CABINETGERMANY:  SOVIET ECONOMIC policy memorandum by the Minister of state at the request of the Foreign Secretary I circulate for the information ofmy colleagues a copy of a minute from Sir W. Strang, Political Adviser to theCommander-in-Chief in Germany, to the Foreign Secretary, enclosing a paperprepared by him after discussion with General Robertson, Deputy military governor, concerning Soviet economic policy in Germany.H. McN.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,V7t,h December, 1946.v   ANNEX .Secretary of State,WHEN I was last in New York you asked that a paper should be preparedgiving an appreciation of Soviet economic policy in their zone of occupation inGermany, with special reference to the discussion on Germany in the Councilof Foreign Ministers.I have accordingly prepared the annexed memorandum, after discussion withGeneral Robertson and Mr. Seal.The conclusions of this paper are already familiar to you as a result of theI talks we have already had.The further paper which you have now asked for, namely a paper givingI an appreciation of the present economic situation in the Soviet zone, is being1 put in hand immediately by General Robertson.The general conclusions reached in the present paper are  (1) In view of the present Soviet policy of removing from the Soviet zonecapital industrial equipment and German scientists and skilled workers, the Soviet zone, which moreover since the detachment of theEastern territories is no longer a surplus food area, will become a liability rather than, an asset if united economically with the Western, Zones. !,)&apos;, .:. ?.hi ilhlJ  b&apos;^.J.fll.h&apos;ib(2) When the Soviet authorities have substantially achieved the strippingof, their zone, which may be within the next six months or so, theymay think that the time has come to unite their zone economicallywith the Western zones.(3) The Soviet authorities may make preparatory proposals to this endat the present or at the forthcoming meeting of the Council of foreign ministers.(4) Side by side with this, they may also make proposals designed to secure their participation in the control of industry in the Western zones,together with proposals for the delivery of products from current production from the Western zones as reparations, partly or whollyin place of further allocations and deliveries of capital equipment from these zones, the prospect of which they are beginning to discount.13758   [32885] b
2(5) In view of the financial commitments of His Majesty&apos;s Government,jointly with the United States Government, in Germany, any suchSoviet proposals would require to be scrutinised with the greatest care, and only accepted, if at all, on stringent conditions, since their effect would be to draw on the resources of the Western zones, at theexpense of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United StatesGovernment.(6) If, as we fear, the Americans should show signs of coming to terms withthe Russians on what we regard as unfavourable terms, we should do our best to dissuade them, and we should make it clear to them thatany financial loss must be borne by them and not by us.w. strang&apos;.&apos;3rd December, 1946.Note on Soviet Economic Policy in Germany1. The economy of the Soviet Union has suffered disastrously from the warand, in particular, from the deliberate and thorough policy of devastation applied by the Germans in the industrial areas occupied by them. There is a dire needfor capital equipment and a desperate hunger for consumption goods.2. The objectives of the Soviet Government, pursued with every determina-tion and resource, are : (a) to acquire equipment to restore and extend Soviet industrial potential (i) for reasons of national defence;(ii) to supply domestic needs;(iii) to provide for export markets; and at the same time(b) to acquire consumption goods, where they can be found or produced in occupied or satellite territories, for more immediate Soviet domesticneeds.3. It cannot be stated with certainty how these directives will be finallytranslated into action in the Soviet Zone, but the following analysis is a reason-able inference from such indications as we have.4. Of the two objectives, the first is likely, in general, to be given preferenceover the second, where iti is attainable, in spite of the wastefulness of bodilyremoving plants from one country to another. In the Soviet Zone in Germany,they seem to have been pursued as follows : The primary policy has been to strip the Soviet Zone of capital equip-ment, and the policy has already been carried to a point even below thelevel agreed in the level of industry plan. The secondary policy has been todevelop to the maximum in the Soviet Zone the production of consumptiongoods for delivery as reparations, using the capital equipment to be left inGermany or capital equipment earmarked for removal, pending its removal.5. In the earlier stages of the occupation, equipment was dismantled tooprecipitately and not according to any well-established plan. Owing to packingand transportation difficulties, there was great wastage, and only a moderatepercentage of the dismantled equipment can have been successfully re-erectedand brought into production, and, even then, at a reduced capacity. It may befor this reason that a halt was called last summer, when Marshal Sokolovskydeclared that the removal of capital equipment from the Soviet Zone had been,in general, completed on 1st May. The Soviet authorities, about the same time,made great play, for political or electoral reasons, with the fact that the wheelsof industry were turning in the Soviet Zone, as contrasted with the stagnationobtaining in the Western Zones, even though it was evident that the products ofindustrial activity in the Soviet Zone were being delivered to the Soviet Unionas reparation.6.   The following table shows, by way of example, the percentage alloca-tion of textile goods produced in the Soviet Zone during the past six months :-Reparations deliveries      ..............Deliveries to Soviet authorities in Germany     .....For German consumption......Illegal deliveries to Russian and German individuals ..Per cent.7015510
7. During the past few weeks there seems to have.been a resumption, ona well-planned but not yet on a massive scale, of the, primary policy of theremoval of capital equipment from the Soviet Zone. But now the soviet authorities appear to be removing not only German industrial equipment butGerman industrial skill. Scientists, industrial planners, mass-productionexperts, technicians and even skilled workers in substantial numbers have beentransferred to the Soviet Union, to what extent under voluntary contract andto what extent under compulsion cannot be accurately determined. The Sovietobjective seems to be not only to develop industrial research for both militaryand peaceful purposes and to promote the production of equipment and goods,but also to employ this German skill for the training of Soviet technicians and workers.8. It is not yet clear whether this removal of German technicians, so faras it has gone, is merely in its initial stage, or whether it is likely to be carriedout in the future to an increasing extent. But in any event, as more industrial equipment is carried away from the Soviet Zone, and as the industrial potential of the Zone is progressively reduced, more and more German technicians and workers will be drawn to the Soviet Union from the Soviet Zone either-&apos;-torejoin their own machines or to find employment which can no longer be offered to them at home.9. It is thought that within the next six months or year, industrialpotential in the Soviet Zone will have been reduced very far below its pre-warfigure (for example, 95 per cent, of the textile machinery industry and well over70 per cent, of the other textile producing and processing capacity will have been removed) and very much below the figure to which it will be reduced in theWestern Zones; and that the output of certain consumption goods now being produced will fall away owing to the removal or deterioration of equipment or to the exhaustion of stocks of raw materials. The textile plants, which produce the bulk of the consumption goods now available for reparations, and which arebeing left to the last in the programme of removals, are working on importedraw material. They are also rapidly wearing out, since they are being over-driven on the three-shift system, and since spare parts and replacements are running short owing to the already almost completed removal of the textilemachinery manufacturing plants.10. The picture thus presented of the Soviet Zone is of an area whichwill probably, within a year or so, be stripped of industrial equipment downto the bone, and, deprived of a large part of its scientific and technical skillin industrial research, organisation, management, and manufacturing processes,and of the cream of its skilled labour, and an area which has been milked for over two years, without return, of the products of German industrial, equipment,labour and accumulated stocks. The result of this must be widespread unem-ployment and impoverishment. Add to this that, as a result of the detachment of the fertile territories now administered by Poland, the Soviet Zone can nolonger be considered as a surplus food area at the present rate of production.11. This impoverishment of the Soviet Zone will be most repugnant to theGermans, even to those Germans upon whom the Soviet authorities most rely tofurther their influence in Germany. This is the dilemma which has constantlyfaced the Russians in Germany. Their economic and security requirements are inconsistent with certain of their political objectives. This is tne explanation of some of the hesitations and reversals in Soviet policy in Germany, and we may expect these to continue.12. It may well be at the moment, when the Russians have drawn from theirZone all. they can hope for in the way of both capital equipment and current production as reparation, and when their Zone would be a liability rather than an asset to the Western Powers, that they will think the time has come to throw it into the common pool. And they may, either now in New York, or later on when the Council of Foreign Ministers tackles the German problem, makepreparatory proposals to this end. These proposals may appear reasonable onthe face of them and will be designed to delay and impede the successful carrying-out of the economic fusion of the two Western Zones within the shortest possibleperiod. They may also be aimed at preserving ties with and bridge-heads inthe Western Zones in order to foment opposition to fusion on the political andeconomic plane. Any such proposals will therefore have to be scrutinised withextreme care, especially in view of the decision of the United States and British
Governments to put money into Germany for the rehabilitation of the german economy. Otherwise the Soviet Zone will bleed the two Western Zones and bringthe joint Americari-British plan to nought.13. The conditions for agreeing to accept the Soviet Zone into the german economic union will have to be stringent and should include : (i)an undertaking, the fulfilment of which should be controlled, that the indigenous resources of the Soviet Zone, such as they are, will bepooled; &quot;(ii) a similar undertaking that the proceeds of exports willbe paid to theImport-Export Agency;(iii) a similar undertaking that no reparations will be taken from current production until there is a genuine surplus in the German import-export account as a whole, the repayment of past credits or advancestaking precedence over reparations;,. (iv) the pooling with the Import-Export Agency of the net value of all pastexports from current production delivered as reparations or notapplied to the payment of imports:(vj the assumption ,by the Soviet Union of an obligation, equivalent to thoseassumed by His Majesty&apos;s. Government and the United States Govern-ment, to contribute financially to the rehabilitation of the german economy..14. Side by side with this policy of the Soviet Government as regards theSoviet Zone, may come a revised policy in regard to the Western Zones. Thereare signs that the Soviet Government no longer really believe that they will receive from the Western Zones more than a relatively small proportion of thecapital equipment promised in the Potsdam Agreement. The ruling factors oftheir policy towards the Western Zones are likely to be, first, their desire on security grounds to share in the control of the industry of the Ruhr which they regard as the balancing factor between their own economic war potential and thatof the Western; Powers, and secondly, their unwillingness to see too marked adifferentiation between the standard of living, in their own Zone and that inthe Western ^Zones. Whereas;a generally impoverished Germany would be ripe for communism, the contrast between an impoverished Soviet Zone and a compara-tively well-off Western area would not provide a very suitable background fortheir propaganda. They are likely therefore to strain every nerve to frustrate the-successful economic fusion of the United States and British Zones, andprobably also to try for a new deal with the Western Powers under which themilking of the Western Zones by means of current deliveries of reparations(particularly steel, of which they are seriously short) would take the place of the potsdam deliveries of capital equipment which, as indicated above, they have probably already discounted. They will almost certainly exploit to the full any indication of a breach between ourselves and the Americans over the joint adminis-tration of the combined zones. That they will take some such line is indicated by certain informal suggestions already made by Marshal Sokolpvsky to GeneralClay. And this may also form part of a new line to be put; forward by M. Molotovin due course in the Council of Foreign Ministers.15.   The Soviet policy would then form a coherent whole, in three parts : :(a) strip the Soviet Zone drastically of capital industrial equipment;(&amp;) when this is1 complete, throw&apos;the zone into the pool;        &apos;V(c) participate in&apos; the control Of German industry in the Western Zones,particularly the Ruhr, aiid draw on the current production of theWestern Zones at the expense of the United Kingdom arid UnitedStates.16. Should the Americans show signs of closing with any Soviet offer ofeconomic or political fusion, the acceptance of which would involve financial loss to the Western Zones, it should be made clear to them that any such financial loss must be borne by them.    &apos;3rd December, 1946.
