BiilS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)mSECRETCP. (46)  458 COPY NO.(15TH DECEMBER.   1946CABINET1 CLOTHES RATIONINGMemorandum by the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs1. I am gravely concerned at the memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade  (C,P. (46) 4-42) and not lessso at the action he proposes to take.2. It is most unfortunate that a proposal of thiskind, which will have the most disastrous effects upon our tradeand perhaps upon our relations with the Dominions,  should only have been available a few days before it was due to beconsidered by the Cabinet and that we should be asked, at thisexceedingly short notice without any possibility of putting the issues before the Dominions-,  to consent to the statementsuggested.3. There are two main issues.      First the action proposed and,  second,  the revelation of the fact that in this vital industry nearly 18 months after the war had ended,  we have-to contemplate very substantially declining production even from present levels.4, With regard to the first,   it is proposed that theexport allocation shall be reduced in one quarter from 26,000tons to 15,000 tons.      Of that 15,000 tons,  3,700 is to be assured to Burma and certain Colonies,  of which Burma is  toobtain nearly half.      The remaining 11,300 tons is to bescrambled for by a long list of countries containing the bestfriends we have in the world.      Let me select three Dominions.We are being pressed by the High Commissioner for Canada to increase their allocation from 900 to 1,900 tons,  instead of which it  is tohe substantially reduced and this  in the case of a country wherethe demand for more British goods is almost overwhelming.      Apartfrom which the certain result of this action, will be to driveCanada    into making long-term arrangements with the United States,with a probable loss  of this market,  and the consequent loss of dollars which we so badly need.Similar considerations apply to Australia and NewZealand,  not quite to the same extent arithmetically, but nearly so-    and these are countries, be it noted,  that amidst their ownPlenty are depriving themselves of butter and meat in order thatwe may get supplies and already have clothes rationing themselves.What the result will be,  I do not like to contemplate, but thePoint above all is that this is proposed without our having had any opportunity of conferring with them about  it beforehand.

5, With regard to the second matter;    I am not fullyconversant with the industrial details, hut it is a staggeringfact that this key industry is in the plight portrayed.      Ithink we should have a comprehensive review and proposals for as energetic a drive as possible to retrieve the situation.A special effort for months past has been put into coal and building materials production and is in prospect for foodproduction in which the labour force has already been increased and these campaigns have yielded so far results that are fairlypromising.6, We certainly cannot afford to continue to incur wide-spread dissatisfaction at home at the insufficiency of supplies in addition to the disastrous effects on our overseas trade.In any case I urge the Cabinet most earnestly not to sanction the proposed statement until the possibilities have been further explored and until the Dominions have been fully informed.A.Dominions Office,  S.W.   1. ,13th December,  1946.
