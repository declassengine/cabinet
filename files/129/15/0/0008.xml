(his document is the property of  his britannic  majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1946A74?SECRETcp. (46) 4427*A December, 1946CABINETCopy No.. 29THE CLOTHING ration memorandum by the President op the Board of trade. I have to make a statement to the House of Commons before Christmason the size of the ration for the period 1st March-31st August, 1947. A decision must also be reached on the size of the ration to aim at for the following period,1st September, 1947-29th February,, 1948, so that firm yarn and cloth production programmes can be put in hand as soon as possible. &quot; The level of supplies tomeet the ration at any one date is determined by the level of production in thecotton, woollen and rayon industries some six to twelve months previously.2.   The size of the clothing ration depends broadly on the following factors : -. ;. .,(a) The labour force&apos;in the textile industries;(b) The provision, which has also to come out of the limited output of textiles,.for household textiles, for the continuing needs of GovernmentDepartments, for industrial uses (especially in the case of cotton);and for exports; and(c) The maintenance of adequate stocks at all stages of manufacture anddistribution.3r The ration for the current six months period 1st September, 1946-28th February, 1947, is 30 coupons; but the coupons for this period were actuallyissued a month in advance-on the 1st August. We had hoped that it might bepossible to increase the ration! substantially to 34 coupons in the Spring of 1947&apos;and to 40; in the Autumn. with a view to getting rid of clothes rationingaltogether in the Spring, or at any rate in the Autumn, of 1948. production has, however, improved only very slowly and it is now apparent on the presenttrend of production that such a target could be achieved only at the expense of practically abandoning the export trade in cotton, goods and crippling: the trade-in other textiles. The future outlook for United Kingdom production is also very uncertain, despite the great efforts which have been, and are being, made to persuade workers toi return to these industries. Any relief we may be able toobtain from imports of apparel cloth, even in 1948, is likely to be very limited;before the war such imports were small. This means that if we are to preservea modest export of cotton and wool goods, as in my view we must, we have to faceup to the bleak prospect of a continuance of clothes rationing for a good deallonger than we had hoped.4. It also appears unlikely, even on, most optimistic assumptions, that theaverage production of cotton yarn over the current quarter and the first Woquarters of next year (which will govern the supply of cotton cloth to meet the ration for the period 1st September, 1947 to 29th February, 1948).will reach therate on which present allocations are based. Immediate prospects are particularlyuncertain owing to the incidence of sickness in the winter months, the effects,of the raising of the school leaving age, the introduction of the 45-hour week andthe possible interruption of fuel supplies; while1 in the second quarter of next year-two holiday periods have to be taken into account. The Materials Committee, infact, reached the conclusion on the^th December that no more than 87,500 tonsof cotton yarn could be allocated in the first quarter of next year; this comparesyith a total allocation for the current quarter of over 95,000 tons. The positionin wool is slightly better but here again the, outlook is affected by the introductionof the 45-hour week and the other factors mentioned above; and it is unlikely thatthere will be any substantial increase in present production, at any rate in thenext few months. In rayon, where the limiting factor is plant, there can be little^crease in 1947, but we may hope for a large expansion in 194.8. when new plant comes into operation.[32828]
25.   In the light of the latest estimates, I propose :  (a) that the ration for the next period-1st March to&quot; 31st August, 1947should be 32 coupons (with the addition of sheets to the. rationing7        system); and... -ye (b) that firm plans should now be laid on the basis that the ration for theperiod 1st September, 1947-29th February, 1948, will be 34. no public announcement about this latter period is necessary until next summer. If, in the meantime, production exceeds expectations it maybe possible slightly to increase the size of the ration for that period.6. As regards (a) in paragraph 5, the size of the ration for the next periodlargely depends on the amount of cloth manufactured for the home market from november 1946-April 1947 and deliveries during; this period have been sub-stantially determined by production programme already put in hand. Althoughstocks of clothing are at present very low,: it should be possible to honour a ration of 32 coupons (with sheets on the ration) though even so this would not mean that the full coupon demand would necessarily be met for particular classesof goods of which supplies are.abnormally low or demand for which is exception-ally high;e.g., men&apos;s suits and shirts: Shortages of these goods would continuehut there,should be a gradual improvement. While there is much to be said in thecircumstances for keeping the ration at 30 coupons in March 1947, particularly ifwe can look forward to 34 only, in the following September, it would not, I feel, be practicable to fix the ration at this level, and, at the same time, to put sheets on the ration. At present sheets are available only to docket holders; but, when brought under the ration, they would be available to the general public as well at 4 couponsfor a single sheet. Having regard to the supply of sheets the coupon expendituremay be regarded as one out of each person&apos;s 32. If the ration were left. at 30-coupons and sheets were added, this would be regarded as, and would, in fact, be.a cut in the ration. The public agitation on the distribution of sheets is now such that I strongly favour putting sheets on the ration. I propose, therefore, to^increase the ration to 32 in March and to proceed with the plan, which I havealready reported to the Lord Presidents Committee, to put sheets on the ration.7. As regards (b) in paragraph 5, a ration of 34, with a corresponding increase in household; textiles, in September 1947, cannot be achieved, in view ofthe production situation outlined in paragraph 4, without a serious loss of exports,particularly of cotton piece-goods. It will, in fact, be necessary to reduce thecurrent quarterly export allocation for cotton goods, 26,245 tons in terms ofcotton yarn (actual exports of cotton goods and production for export are, how-*ever, running well below this level at a rate of about 22,500 tons), to 15,000 tons.It will also mean reducing rayon exports, for the time being, from the current rateof about 36 million square yards per 4 months to 28 million square yards or a little less (this figure would, however, still be1 in excess of the pre-war level). On woolpiece-goods, which may well have a greater long-term value than cotton, and forwhich export prospects in America generally, and in the United States inparticular, are specially good, a small increase in exports should still be possible&quot;(though even so the figure would be well below the pre-war rate).8. So drastic a cut in exports of cotton goods will raise very serious issues.Under present arrangements, almost the whole of the export allocation is divided between (a) market allocations &quot; to countries (mainly in the Empire) which are dependent upon us for supplies and (b) the &quot; Open Pooh&quot; from which exportersare free to export to any destination they choose. Of the current export allocation-of 26,245 tons, 20,860 &quot;tons are allotted to market allocations and 4,300 tons tothe Open Pool.   There are three possible ways of dealing with the problem: (1) To continue the present scheme, retaining the Open Pool as at presentbut reducing each market allocation;(2) To abolish the Open Pool and to share the available exports among thepresent Empire allocation holders; or(3) To maintain market allocations to the most needy areas at a reduced1 rate and to leave the cotton industry free to export the remainderto whatever destination it wishes.The effect of these three courses is illustrated in the Annex.&apos; 9.   The first course would give little satisfaction to anyone in viewof thesmall-quantities that would be available. The second course would remove allprospect of exports to non-Empire markets, many of which are in the &quot; dollar
.area; and would gravely prejudice the long-term interests of the cotton industry.Since early in the war the industry has been in a strait-jacket, and has been required to send its products to specified markets, not all of which have been of any long-term interest to it. It has thus had no opportunity of preparing for free market conditions except under the very limited scope provided by the open Pool,: and hitherto this: has been too small to be of much use. It seem?certain that the United States will not agree to continue Combined Planningafter the end of the year, and the United States Government have already decidedthat they will not continue the arrangements under which they have set asideiquantities for export. This means in effect that they will be free to send their exports to any market in the world. A further very serious practical objectionto courses 1 and 2 is that in either case it will add to the difficulties of relievingcritical shortages here, e.g., in shirtings and linings; the Dominions are closelyinterested in these goods and the retention of an allocation system which givessuppliers of those markets a claim on these goods will make the position at homestill worse.10. For these reasons I am strongly in favour of adopting the third course,i.e-., limiting the market allocations as much as possible, namely, to the mostneedy areas for which we have a special responsibility. These areas, consistingof Burma, Malaya and other Far East dependencies, the British East african territories and some of the very small Colonies, must continue to be helped, since otherwise it is unlikely that they will receive a proper share of supplies. I would propose to allocate 3,700 tons for this purpose; and to have these exports plannedas is done for home supplies. So far as the rest of the allocation for export isconcerned 11,300 tons &quot;the United Kingdom cotton industry should be free tosend its products where it wishes, and thus be enabled to begin to re-build itsexport trade on a sound basis. This does not mean that the Dominions and othercountries which will lose market allocations will cease to get supplies from theUnited Kingdom. There are considerable orders in the industry which will resultin the continuing delivery of goods probably over the next nine months. Furtherit will be open to these countries to place orders for a share of the quantity of11,300 tons; many of them in the present world shortage of textiles depend upon us for. supplies as we do upon them for imports and it is right, therefore, toprovide them this opportunity of obtaining some textiles from this country.Quite apart from this, it is vital that Lancashire shall be able to continue at least a modest export if the cotton industry is ever to be restored to a flourishing-condition. &apos; - 1 &quot;11. In the preceding paragraphs I have referred to the serious effects anincrease of the ration even to 34 coupons in the autumn of 1947 will have on our exports. It must, however, be said, on the other side, that a ration at that ratemore than two years after the end of the war is extremely austere and will certainly be regarded as such by the general public. Such a rate is far below theaverage of pre-war clothing purchases and still further below the public&apos;s desiredlevel of purchase to-day, both because there has, in the meantime, been a rise in standards of living and also because there is a large back-log of demand,accumulated during the war, to make up. It is no doubt enough to provide aminimum of essential clothing, but it leaves little, if any, room for the &quot;. frills  the sportswear and the party dresses which are of particular importance to the younger generation. Nevertheless, the effects on exports of even such a limitedincrease in the home ration as I propose will be extremely serious, and I do not&quot;think that we should be justified in reducing exports still further in Order to afford a little more relief at home.I propose, therefore, subject to my colleagues&apos; concurrence-to make an announcement as soon as possible, and in any case before christmas, that the clothes ration for the period 1st March-31st August will be 32 coupons, and that sheets will be brought underthe ration as from the beginning of that period;to put into effect firm production plans on the basis of a ration of 34coupons for the following period, but, on the understanding that, ifproduction improves beyond expectations in coming months, the ratewill be slightly increased; andas regards exports of cotton goods, to restrict market allocations in future to the most needy, areas for which we have a special responsibility,leaving the industry free, so far as the rest of the export allocationis concerned, to send its products wherever it wishes.
, In announcing the ration I propose to explain fully the reasons underlying-the smallness of the increase and to make it quite clear that., failing a very substantial improvement in the labour force of the textile industries, and in therate of output in those industries, there can be no hope of clothes rationing being-brought to an end for a long time to come.- In view of the importance of these issues being widely and clearly understood, I would propose to supplement suchan announcement by a talk over the wireless.R.
