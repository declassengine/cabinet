/TO(THIS DOCUllENT 13&apos; THE PROPERTY OF&apos;HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT)secret. P. (46)448BulRMA:    CONSTITUTIONAL &quot;position memorandum by tbg Secretary of State for BurmaMy colleagues will remember that at their meeting on 5th December ( Co EL (46)103rd Conclusions;   Minute 2) they agreed that we should invite a delegation of the BurmaExecutive Council to London, early in January to discuss thenext steps in the constitutional progress of Burma.2.     The telegrams: that have since been exchanged, with theGovernor have been circulated.   The Executive Council on being sounded reacted favourably, but the forking Committeeof AFPFL (the only important personages in which, with perhaps one exception, appear to be members of theExecutive Council) decided that prior acceptance inprinciple of the following four demands must be a pre-condition of any discussions, and that the discussions should be for the purpose of &quot;concretising1&apos; those principles:;,1.     when the Cabinet Mission came to India it came forthe specific purposes announced, namely, to take steps for formation of Constituent Assembly and interim government.    Similarly it will be necessary when H.%Government invites Executive Council delegation, tomake an announcement that delegation is invited for thepurpose of concretising the following basic principles.(I)-  Interim NationaE Government with full powersand with Governor as constitutional head.(II)   The coming general election to be held not for restoration of Government of Burma Act 1935 but forconvening a Constituent Assembly for whole of Burma,free from the participation of non-Burman nationals.(Ill)   Immediate steps to be taken from now toprepare the&apos;way for a free united Burma.. (IV)   a categorical declaration to be made forthwiththat Burma would get complete independence within ayear.&quot;The latest developments are reported in the Goverhortstelegram 248.   The telegrams leave the impression that,whatever Aung San may say, what we are in fact faced with -9th December; 1946-COPY NO,CABINET

116is a carefully staged political manoeuvre designed to secure from us as a condition   of a ny discussions and in advanceof them a substantial political concession.4.     I would have been prepared to recommend to mycolleagues that we should in fact in the course of these discussions agree that Burma should have freedom to decide whether to remain inside or outside the Commonwealth,though the decision on that matter is&apos; one that would fall to be taken at a later date either by an elected legislatureor by the constituent assembly.   The right to secede isimplicit (and is well known by the more experienced Burmesepoliticians to be implicit) in the Dominion status whichwe have promised Burma (in so many words in 1940); itwould be impossible to refuse&apos;formally to assure Burmathat she would be free to elect independence outside theEmpire now that India has had a formal assurance to that effect.   Now that the issue has been raised, we must faceit at once, and a refusal to do so would &quot;probably-precipitatetrouble.5.     But (though it may be said to go without saying) the concession which it would represent is probably politically(i.;e. the value set on it by Burmese opinion) one of themost important that we shall be in a position to give in the interim period.     On the assumption that we want to avoidlegislation, at least until we are dealing with a body witha legislature behind it, the best - that concession havingbeen made in 1 in line - that we should still have to offer thisdelegation if it were to come here in the near future, is:(a) an understanding as regards certain of the Governor&apos;sdiscretions ry-ancTindividual judgment powers.      .without legislation by Parliament, no formal change in the present constitutional position could he made:   and- there arecertain specific concessions which have been asked for,isuhhas that all expenditure should in future be votable, whichcould not be admitted by convention, since they would bein flat contravention of the provisions of&quot; the Act.     (Butit is relevant that in his letter of 30th Kay to thePresident of the Indian Congress the Viceroy made it plain that in relation to the Interim Indian Government there couldbe no legal or constitutional change and all that was offered was close consultation and consideration, and mutualmust and co-operation. )(b) a formal undertaking that the legislature when electedsuld either be or would: serve as the basis for theonstituent ass emb1y;:9) a greater transfer of authority to the Burmese in theields of defence and external - affairs;   and perhaps an[mangement more closely associating ministerial Burma with Frontier Areas;&apos;1 possibly some further financial concessions, though thedse on merits for these is an exceedingly weak one;

117(e) certain assurances as regards programme and as regardsour good intentions and sincerity.6.     My colleagues will agree that all this - though of substantial practical value - does not amount to a verygreat d-eal for Burmese leaders to display to impatientand ignorant bub highly nationalistic followers.     If we &apos;now play this important political card of the right to choose complete independence, we have little left with which to bargain in respect of the period between now and theelections.     It is equally important that if ARPFL aregiven this trick; before discussions begin, there is very ilitHemore that they can hope to show on return to Burma on theconclusion of their discussions with us.     That may provoke&apos;a more intransigent attitude on their part and the risk that they will face us, after those discussions, with thesame threat of resignation as is now being employed tobring pressure upon us.7.-     I doubt, at the same time- our making much advance inthis matter by logic or by reason,    we are dealing witha body politically immature, singularly lacking inexperience of the outside world, and with no appreciation of the weakness of Burma or of the difficulties that,financially and otherwise unless she has our full support. .The analogy which ehe Council continue to seek to draw with india is a false one - and-, they ignore, naturally, thefact that the importance from the general imperial pointof view of retaining Burma is markedly less than theimportance of retaining India.     Nor am I altogetherconvinced by the Governor&apos;s argument that we must back upAFPFL - the very insistence of&quot;aFPFL on a concession withwhich to convince its adherents of its power &quot;is in itselfan indication that we may be surrendering to a party thatmay-not be able to maintain effective control. ,8.     v/ere we in a stronger position I should thereforeprefer to avoid committing ourselves at this stage.     but our position on the evidence available to me is very farfrom strong.      The morale of the police and the authorityof senior officers has been severely shaken by the recentstrike and AFPFL&apos;s Influence in the police force is substantial.     Apart from Indian troops whom for political reasons we cannot use, we have only some 2000 British troopsin the country.       Of the balance of the Burma Army the5 battalions drawn from Plains Burma are not dependable: andon a long view it would not make for the ultimate unity of burma to use- the hill men against a political movement.     the brigade which was some time ago provisionally earmarked forreinforcement in emergency from Singapore would probablytake three weeks to reach Rangoon.     (I think we should inany event consider moving it to Burma now, not as areinforcement, but in relief qf Indian troops who arebeing repatriated)    We should,   therefore ,be very awkwardlyPlaced if we were faced with disturbances on a. considerable

118scale.9. &apos;   I cannot judge whether AFPFL, if they were to resign,would in fact provoke disturbances,      I think it is more likely that they would seek to embarrass the administrationby stimulating a general strike or possibly by endeavouringto set up a parallel government, possibly joining hands,with the Communist dissidents from the League who alreadyare moving in that direction.     In either event we should,given our present shortage of force, the undermannedcondition of the Services, and the local feeling,inescapable in present circumstances, that the future lies with AFPFL -&amp;r?d not with Ho ii G. , find it very difficult tomeet the situation.     And a humiliating climb-down would be most undesirable.10.     I suggest therefore that, on a broad view, thebalance of advantage probably rests with accepting theGovernor&apos;s recommendation.     But there is a real Eiskthat even if we do accept it, we may be faced with furtherconsequential or related demands as a-condition of a visit to this country by a delegation.       I think that, if mycolleagues agree that we should give the guarantee, Ishould ask the Governor to get it quite clear from Aung San,in the most formal way, that if the guarantee Is given wemay then take it as settled that the delegation will come and. come without further bargaining.11.     As regards the form in which our decision is to becommunicated to the Council, I think that if we are driven to make this concession, the wise course would be to makeit without argument and that the Governor should beauthorised to inform the Council as part and parcel ofthe invitation to send a delegation, that he had confirmedfrom HoM.G. that it was in fact their intention that Burmashould be free to decide for herself when the time camewhether to remain in the Empire or not12.     The public announcement of the invitation might be tothe effect that H. II G. had received representations from the,Governor/&apos;s Council asking for further immediate constitu-tional advance and seeking confirmation that it would befor Burma herself to decide when the time came whether ornot to remain within the Commonwealth;    that H. M. G. had authorised the Governor to oonfirm that the decision whetheror not to remain inside the Commonwealth would be for Burmaherself to take when the time came; and that they had invited the Council, who had accepted their invitation, tosend a small delegation of their members to London early inJanuary to discuss the remaining matters raised by them.13,     I invite ray colleagues to approve the proposals contained in paragraphs 10   -  12 above.P. -L.Burma Office, S.W.I.9-th December,i946
