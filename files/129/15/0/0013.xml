jtoUTEP.Z&apos;P.-i.Jr.:^Ut.. ..&amp;Art*document IS THE  PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1946CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 2CP. (46) 4472nd December, 1946CABINETREPORT  OF   THE   BRITISH  PARLIAMENTARY   delegation to GREECEMemorandum by the Minister of state circulate for the information of the Cabinet a report on conditions in greece, together with two appendices on the conditions of Law and Order andon Trades Unionism, prepared by Mr. Seymour Cocks, M.P., and the othermembers of the British Parliamentary Delegation which visited Greece lastAugust at the invitation of the Greek Government, and a memorandum on themilitary situation prepared by Mr. Vane, M.P.This comprehensive report, of which copies are being presented to the king of Greece and to the Greek Government, represents a considerable achievementon the members&apos; part in view of the short time available to them in Greece. the delegation met representatives of all shades of opinion in the country and avoidedbeing drawn into political controversy. Their report is worthy of close considera-tion and I should like in particular to draw attention to the following points in it: (1) The Delegation was in Greece immediately before the plebiscite and wasconsequently in a good position to express an opinion on its validity. their conclusion is that while intimidation and malpractice existed on both sides, andwas on the whole more pronounced in the case of the Right, there is no reason to doubt that the King would in any event have secured a majority.(2) The report gives an account of the abnormal conditions which have pro-provoked and in the view of the delegation justified drastic measures by theauthorities against disturbers of the peace. It provides a careful and balancedaccount of the state of law and order in certain districts. The delegation^conclusion is that Right and Left wings share responsibility for the disorders andthey are not prepared to say which group is the more culpable. The first appendixcritically examines the operation of the special security measures and in par-ticular the working of the Security Committees established under government control. The delegation voice some criticism concerning the constitution of these committees, but speak highly of the integrity of the Greek judiciary.(3) In dealing with the economic situation in Greece, the report draws attention to the poverty of the country, the great destruction wrought by the warand inadequate system of taxation and the necessity of reforming the civil service.(4) The delegation think the presence of British troops has had no adverse effect on Anglo-Hellenic relations and the psychological value of their presence in Greece in the present international situation is appreciated by all but theextreme Left. The delegation, nevertheless, feel that in the event of the internal situation deteriorating British troops might be involved in civil disorders andthat there is consequently a strong case for their early withdrawal, subject tostrategic and international considerations on which the delegation do not attemptto pronounce an opinion.(5) The second appendix to this report consists of an examination of theTrades Union situation in Greece, a problem which has been of grave concern to His Majesty&apos;s Government for some months now. Apart from the present dispute, the writers of this appendix emphasise the fact that Greek Trades Unions13721   [32797] B
2will not flourish or fulfil a useful function until their members learn to concen-trate on the improvement of industrial and economic conditions and to devoteless energy to political intrigue. They recommend in particular the setting upof national machinery and the sending of a small British Mission to advise on theconstruction of such machinery.. (6) The report pays warm tributes to the various British missions in, Greece,particularly the Military, Economic and Police Missions which are shown...tobe doing very valuable work. Finally I would draw attention, to the recom-mendations put forward at the end of the report. With many of these I am inagreement and all are or have been the subject of careful study;&apos; The extentto which it will be possible to give effect to the majority of them depends bothon the ability of the Greek Government to put its house in order and on themeasure of economic and administrative assistance which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, in spite of our own strained resources, can make available to Greece, or canpersuade the United States to supply, in the critical year ahead.H. McN.Foreign Office, 2nd December. (1946:.
BRITISH  PARLIAMENTARY  DELEGATION  TO  GREECEEEPOETAt the invitation of the Greek Government a British Parliamentary;Delegation visited Greece in August 1946. The Delegation consisted ofMr. Seymour Cocks (leader), Mr. E/&apos;R. Bowen, Mr. Leslie Hale, Mr. JohnMaude, K.C., Mr. \V. Monslow, Mr. W. M. R. Vane and Mr. Evelyn Walkden,Mr. John Parker, originally included; was unable, owing to illness, to accompany the party.The Delegation (with the exception of Mr. Brown and Mr. Walkden, whoarrived two days later) reached Athens on 16th August, and left on29th August. They spent six days in Athens and the Piraeus. During theother: six days, various members of the Delegation visited, amongst other places,-PatraSy Corinth, Tripolis and Sparta in the Peloponnese, Salonika andEdessa in Macedonia, Larissa in Thessaly, Kavala, Xanthi, and the Island ofCrete&apos;.::-        - - - &apos; f i 5   -i.C       ij ! &apos; .- &apos;. ;During the1 course of their visit, the Delegation had the honour of being received by the Regent, His Beatitude Archbishop Damaskinos. They hadinterviews with Members of the Council of Ministers and with the leadersof various political parties, including M. Soufoulis (Liberal), M. Papandreou.(Democratic Socialist), M. Kannelopoulos (Unity Party), M. Sofianopoulos(Republican left), M. Tsirimpkis (Socialist E.L.D.), M. Partsalides (E.A.M.)and M. Zachariades (Communist K.K.E.). They met the elected executive of the General Confederation of Labour, and also the new provisional Exeeu-tive appointed by the Government, as well as many representatives of TradeUnions, Workers&apos; Associations and Professional, Industrial and PoliticalOrganisations. They visited prisons, hospitals, factories and various publicinstitutions. They had conferences with Mr. Maben, the American chief ofthe.U.N.R.R.A. Mission; Lieutenant-General Clark and Sir John Nixon of theBritish Economic Mission, Sir Charles Wickham, head of the British PoliceMission, Major-General Rawlins, Chief&apos; of the British Military Mission, and lieutenant-General Crawford, Commander-in-chief, British Land Forces,.Greece, and received much help from all of them. They desire to1 thank theBritish officers and officials they met for their valuable co-operation.The Delegation also wish to thank the Greek Government for theirgenerous hospitality and uniform kindness. They are satisfied that they weregiven every facility by the Government to investigate conditions in Greece.They were able to go where they liked, and to see whom they wished. Atthe same time, the fact that they were the guests of the Government had Itsdisadvantages as well as its advantages. When visiting the Provinces theywere accompanied by Government representatives who acted as their hosts,and at each town they were received by the local Nomarch, a Governmentofficial. This, although perhaps unavoidable, had its obvious drawbacks, andno representatives of the Left made their appearance either at Sparta or-Edessa. (*)But having said this, and bearing in mind the shortness of their stay, the-fact that they were only able to see a small part of the country, and the very-great handicap of having to rely on interpreters, the Delegation feel they were-able to obtain valuable information and to form a fair impression, of thegeneral state of, the country. They have, endeavoured to state their views:as clearly and objectively as possible.Political State of country the political state of the country is very distressing.Whilst the bulk of the people perhaps 85 per cent, of the population -only wish to live a peaceful life, extremists on both sides are engaging inacts of violence and terrorism to the great disturbance of civil order. !Although the feelings of hatred, fear, revenge and discontent resultingfrom the events of December 1944 have by no means died away, it is clearthat acts of violence by both sides have considerably increased since the advent of the present Government.In parts of Macedonia and the mountainous areas of Thessaly, especiallyaround Mount Olympus, there is proceeding, what almost amounts to aminiature Civil War between Left-wing bands and the Gendarmerie.It is said that some of these bands receive aid and encouragement fromthe mother side of the frontier, and it is probable that this is the case.It would be a mistake, however, tc assume that the activities of thesebands are entirely due to foreign inspiration..There is evidence that amongst these bands are many Left-wing supporterswho have fled to the mountains to escape terrorism exercised by the extremeRight.(*) Since their return the Delegation have seen statements in the GreekCommunist press alleging that at Corinth and Larissa certain left-wing supporterswere prevented from seeing them. They have no means of testing the truth ofthis.   But they saw many left-wing representatives at other places.&apos; [32797] &apos;   &apos; :    B 2
On the other hand, many Eight-wing partisans have been shot by the Left,and this has given rise to acts of retaliation and revenge.Unofficial statistics are unreliable and it would be impossible withoutprolonged investigation on the spot to estimate the degree of culpability tobe attached to the respective sides.Members of the Delegation who went from Salonika to Edessa wereescorted by a strong armed guard.In Salonika some nervousness was displayed as to the possibility of an actual foreign invasion from the North, and there was talk of a movementhaving for its object the formation of an autonomous Macedonian provinceor. state. The Delegation do not think there is much popular backing forsuch a movement at present,, although they were informed that in commercial,circles discontent had been aroused by the alleged over-centralisation of authority at Athens. .     ;      ;&apos; *    &apos;At LarissaIn some parts of Thessaly, especially in the Larissa-Volos-Pharsalatriangle, armed Eight-wing bands are operating with the utmost audacity.One day in August, a notorious Eight-wing bandit named Sourlas actuallyentered the town of Larissa, headquarters of the 2nd Greek Army Corps,and remained there for some time without being arrested. On another day thepolitical correspondent of the Communist newspaper Rizopastis, a journalistnamed Vidalis, was taken out of a railway train near Volos by bandits and shot in the presence, it is said, of gendarmes. As far as the Delegation know,no arrests were made. &apos;These armed bands are apparently tolerated by the authorities and no attempt is made , to suppress , them. Although it. as claimed in certain quarters that their object is to prevent the spread of Communism, thefact is that they never engage the Communist bands in battle but devotethemselves to terrorising the villages and exacting blackmail from anyonerich enough to pay it. In the area south of Pharsala, we were told, the eight-Wing bandit leader levies a toll of one per cent, upon the productionof the districts Although it is unlawful to bear arms this law is onlyenforced against members of the Left. In certain districts in Thessalythe Government are supplying arms to* their civilian : supporters: british officials are disturbed at the possible consequences of this. :The PeloponneseIn the Peloponnese the peasants are traditionally Monarchist and the left-wing allege that, being in a minority, they have been subjected toviolent persecution and terrorism exercised by X-ites and armed bandits,with the connivance, if not the actual co-operation, of the Gendarmerie.They state that as a result of this persecution thousands&apos; of left-wingsupporters have fled from Laeonia and Messinia and taken refuge in Athens,Tripolis and other towns. An E.A.M delegation, seen at Tripolis, statedthat although there had once been a strong Republican party in the port of Ivalamata it was now impossible to send any E.A.M. leader there for fear he would be killed on the way. The staff of their newspaper had recently been arrested and the journal had ceased publication. No one who had taken part in the Resistance movement was safe.The Delegation were given a detailed list of a large number of alleged&quot;&apos;beatings-up &quot; and acts of violence by X-ites and Gendarmes in the villages of Arcadia. They were also given the names of 38 inhabitants of Messinia who, it was alleged had been murdered by X-ites since 1st July.They also heard from Eight-wing organisations counter-allegations to. theeffect that Monarchist supporters in the villages were afraid of being attacked by Left-wing gunmen.The head of the Gendarmerie, Lieutenant-Colonel Pappas, an officer of28 years&apos; service, whose bearing impressed the Delegation, stated that when,as. had happened in a few instances, members of the Gendarmerie gotout of hand, he personally investigated the cases and the men were&apos;punished. 1 .&apos; &apos; -Whilst the Delegation were at Tripolis an ex-E.L.A.S. officer was shotdead outside the Headquarters of the Gendarmerie. It was suggested thatthis man had been murdered by his own side in order to convince the delegation that a state of violence existed in the town. Although the delegation cannot say that this is an impossible explanation,, they donot feel that it is a very probable one.At Sparta, no one representing the Eepublican or Left-wing point ofview made an appearance. Members of the public, questioned on thesubject, stated that the number of Left-wing sympathisers in Laconia was1very small and that their leaders had recently been recalled to Athens.Later in the day, the Delegation met some of these leaders in the localprison.   The town appeared to be peaceful.During their brief visit to the Peloponnese the Delegation had no opportunity of verifying the accuracy or otherwise of the various charges and counter-charges made by the delegations which came to see them.They can only say - -   - - ..(1) That the charges made by the Left were far more numerous and&apos;,detailed (names and dates being given in many cases) than the counter-charges made by the Eight which, on the whole,&apos; were vagueand general.
(2) That as the Eight appeared to be in a large majority and had behind them the coercive powers of the Security Committees and theGendarmerie, they had far more opportunities of intimidating the left than the Left had of intimidating the Eight.The Delegation are of the opinion that these opportunities have notbeen entirely neglected.AthensIn Athens, comparative order and security prevailed. But the Delega-tion received many complaints of intimidation being exercised at night byarmed gangs in the suburbs and cases of political murders were reported.Efforts to trace or apprehend the authors of these outrages did not seemto have met with much success.The Security measures the Government have taken exceptional measures to deal with a gravelyabnormal situation.Security Committees have been set up in every Province and under theregulations people can be arrested, put in prison and detained indefinitelywithout trial.Under the 1924 Law against bandits which the Government have againput into force, the Security Committees also have the power of deportingpeople to the islands on the grounds that &apos;&apos; they are dangerous to public order.&quot; It may well be that by now over 1,000 persons have been deportedand these include members of E.A.M. local committees and the Editorialstaffs of Left-wing newspapers. They also include women, some with children. .Allegations have been received to the effect that some of these islandsare arid and barren, with scanty water supplies.In addition to these Committees, Courts-Martial have been set up in.Macedonia,&apos; Thrace, Epirus and Thessaly. (The operation of these Courts-Martial has now been extended to cover the other Provinces of Greece.)These Courts-Martial have the power in certain cases of inflicting the death penalty which is frequently carried out within a week of the sentence.The Trade UnionsThe Government have also taken exceedingly drastic measures in con-nection with the Trade Unions.Following on a Judicial decision they have displaced the electedExecutive Committee of the General Confederation of Labour and the elected executives of many Trade Unions and Trades Councils and havereplaced them by Government nominees.The Government have also , seized Trade Union offices and records andarrested many of the leaders.The  Delegation have received many complaints  of  alleged acts of.violence by the Police against Trade Union leaders.   This question is dealtwith more fully in another section of this report.The PlebisciteIt was obvious to the Delegation that the Plebiscite would result in alarge majority for the return of the King and that many Republicans wouldvote for this.This was due to three main causes : First, the desire of the majorityof the people for Peace and Order and the belief that the return of theKing would lead to the restoration of social stability.Second, the almost universal belief, fostered to some extent by Eight-wing propaganda, that the British Government desired such a result andthat a vote against the King would be a vote for Eussia against Britainand for Balkan aggression against Greek integrity.Third, a great fear of communism, and a repetition of the events ofDecember 1944.The delegation feel that these three factors alone would have been sufficient to ensure a Monarchist victory.But persons of considerable responsibility endeavoured to make it clearthat the Government intended to take few chances in the matter and thatin many ways the scales were weighted against the Eepublicans. aFor example, Liberal Deputies complained that owing to Eight-wingbanditry they were unable to get to their constituencies^) and one formerLiberal Cabinet Minister stated that if he went outside Athens he was afraid he would be shot.They also said that if they held meetings in certain districts people wouldbe afraid to come to them. The Delegation noted, however, that in parts-of the highly troubled area of Macedonia members of the Opposition seemedto be enjoying freedom of speech.The arrest and deportation of hundreds of local E.A.M. leadersprevented them from taking part in the Plebiscite campaign.(&apos;) It is only fair to say that a Populist deputy for the Olympus area said thathe was unable to get to his constituency either.
. - government action against the Trades Unions (discussed in,, anotherpart of the Report) had disorganised the machinery of the workers politicaltrade union organisation.     ... , : ,      .It was alleged that many thousands of Left-wing, supporters ,had been driven from their villages by intimidation and dared not return to vote.;  Seven Republican provincial daily newspapers  (six E.A.M. and oneLiberal) had suspended publication owing to alleged intimidation/  It was;also   alleged   that  Republican newspapers    published  in &apos; Athens   werefrequently destroyed by Monarchists on their way to the Provinces. .:   .&apos;: \It was, alleged that the device of giving each voter two or three ballot-papers would facilitate intimidation-especially in the case of Civil Servants.and members, of the armed forces who might be required to produce the.,papers they had&apos;t used in order to show how they had voted. ,   ,       . ... &apos;;&apos;The utilisation by the Government of all available means for Monarchist,propaganda, including the radio and the display of posters in every Govern-&apos;ment Department, the presence of an active pro-Monarchist gendarmerie,.,and the fact that, owing to the Nomarch system, all local officials were-supporters of the: Government and all the machinery of provincial adminis-tration was in their hands, inevitably handicapped the Opposition. ;Whilst these factors were not decisive they rendered the Monarchistvictory less impressive than the published figures indicated, and they may:have had the effect of deepening the resentment with which sections of the&quot;community regard the Government. -;iThe Delegation, however, do not dispute the fact that a majority vote-;for the return of the King was in accordance with the present mood of the -Greek people. Whether that mood will change and it may change rapidly- depends on future events.British ResponsibilityThere is a widespread belief in Greece not confined to the extreme left that everything the Greek Government does is in accordance with Britishwishes. For any mistakes the Greek Government makes and for, anyunpopular action it takes the British Government will be blamed. On theother hand, if the Greek Government acts wisely and justly and in accordance &apos;with democratic principles British prestige will thereby be enhanced and theBritish Government will receive due praise. The Delegation submit thatthe implications of this perhaps somewhat embarrassing, and undesiredsituation call for very serious consideration.A Folioy of ReconciliationThe Delegation interviewed a number of prominent politicians repre--senting non-Governmental parties and ranging from the Centre Position to &apos;the extreme Left. .       &apos;From these interviews and from other sources they formed the opinionthat there was a growing ,desire in responsible circles&apos; in Greece&apos;for the-adoption of a policy of Reconciliation.The principal suggestions made to them were: -(1) That an All-Party Government should be formed embracing all sections except the extreme left, which should have the moral,and perhaps the practical, support of the British Government.(2) That this Government should proclaim a General Amnesty or at anyrate a policy of clemency towards political offences.(3) That the special Security measures should be repealed and ordinaryconstitutional law re-established and that this would cause the-refugees to return to their homes!(4) That the new Government should devote its attention to re-establish-ing Law and Order and to the Economic Reconstruction of thecountry. :(5) That after a period new elections should be held on an up-to-dateRegister.The E.A.M. Central Committee informed the Delegation this was before-the Plebiscite that if such a Government were formed they would support it.The Delegation suggest that the return of the King might well afford agolden opportunity for strongly attempting the formation of such a Govern -ment and for rallying the widespread popular desire for Peace and Security &apos;to its support.The bitterness and long-standing divisions of Greek political life, however,must make the formation of such a Government a matter of the utmostdifficulty.Friendship for BritainThe Delegation were greatly impressed by the feeling of friendship and.admiration for Great Britain that existed -everywhere in Greece. , This -friendship is of a long-standing and deep-seated character and pervaded allclasses. Even those who blamed the British Government for their allegedsupport of the Right stated that for the British people they had the warmestaffection. -There is no doubt that in Greek .eyes Britain stands for thoseideals of Freedom and Democracy which the Greek people cherish themselves-.
v7British Troops in GreeceThere was no evidence that the presence of British troops in Greece had had any adverse effect upon Anglo-Hellenic relations. Their standard of conduct has been high and the Begent described, their behaviour asperfect.&apos;&apos; Their withdrawal was demanded by the Communist Party, by11A.M. and by the Left-wing generally, but the Delegation met certainSocialist groups who were not opposed to their presence. Their value as amoral support to Greece in the present difficult international situation,particularly in view of possible threats from the North, was appreciated by many Republicans. ....: Nevertheless, in view of, the danger, should Civil Disorder increase, ofBritish troops being, involved in matters which should be settled by the. Greeks themselves, the Delegation feel there is a strong case for their earlywithdrawal from Greece.      . &apos;, ... .&apos;The Delegation realise that a decision on this question may involve con-, siderations of strategy and high policy which are outside the scope of their- enquiries.   ; -Because of these same considerations they make no comment of their ownon,the suggestion that Britain should guarantee the present frontiers of greece, but merely state objectively that a declaration to that effect wouldgratify the Greek people and remove many of their anxieties.Memorandum on the Military Situation by Mi?. W. M. B. Vane isattached to this ,report.Local GovernmentThe Greeks are ardent politicians but their opportunities of taking partin the practical affairs of administration are limited.Under the present Greek Constitution the 40-odd Provinces or Nomesare governed by Prefects or Nomarchs appointed by the Government.The Nomarch represents in his area virtually all the GovernmentMinistries except the Ministry of Justice. - 1,. ;He governs by delegation, controlling the Gendarmerie Commanders andappointing the Mayors and Headmen of the towns and villages. ...When the political complexion of the Government at Athens changes theNomarchs are changed also and all the sub-functionaries as well.Thus, although the Greeks are democratic by nature their system oflocal government, is undemocratic or authoritarian.The Delegation believe that in any country Democracy should be built up from the bottom and that in Greece the natural way of. doing this wouldbe to create democratically elected local councils, rural, urban and provincial,which would give the Greek people,the opportunity of governing themselves&apos;and of gaining experience in local administration.&apos;But for this to happen the Greeks would have to change their Constitu-tion. This is a delicate matter to suggest to a Sovereign State, and itis only because the Delegation feel that such a change is fundamentallydesirable that they mention it at all.Position of WomenThe Delegation noted with some interest that the position of women in Greece appears to be much the same as it was in the days of Pericles.Greek women have not yet obtained the vote and very few women werepresent at any of the public receptions and formal banquets given tothe Delegation. There seems to be no reason why the franchise in Greeceshould not be extended to women, and the Delegation suggest that in any future&apos; Parliamentary Mission to Greece a woman Member of parliament might be included.Over Reliance on BritainGreek friendship, already referred to, has led in many quarters to an almost helpless reliance on Britain to help Greece out of all her financialand. economic difficulties. Conversations with leading statesmen made this point perfectly clear. In some cases, political leaders have got somuch into the habit of looking to Britain to put their country on its feet,that they have almost lost sight of the imperative need of doing their utmost themselves to put their own house in order. If, in the end, Britainproves unable to provide all the material assistance they expect and requirethere may arise a wide-spread feeling of disillusionment almost amountingto. despair.Material ConditionsGreece has suffered terribly from the war and from civil disturbances.It is estimated that nearly 900,000 lives have been lost and these include many young men and skilled workers. Partly due to this and partly due to under-nouvishment the productivity of labour has fallen to50 per cent, of pre-war level.227,000 houses have been damaged or demolished and 2,000 villagespartly or wholly, destroyed. There is much overcrowding and there arenjany homeless people.The main rail way. line from Athens to Salonika is out of action, tunnelsand bridges have been blown up, and it is estimated that it would take
a first-class British firm eighteen months to restore the system. By Greekstandards the minimum might be five years.Some of the other railways have been repaired but there is an acute shortage of locomotives and rolling stock. Bail charges and fares are-extremely high.Roads are atrocious. Of the 10,000 kilom. of Class A highways only per cent, are in good condition, 35 per cent, are usable but the remaining60 per cent, are almost impassable. One out of every three vehiclesemployed by U.1SI.R.R.A. needs repair after one journey. It takes 22 hours to travel by jeep from Athens to Salonika, a distance of 220 miles.Transport charges are exorbitant. It costs about  3 10s. a ton tobring cotton 60 miles into Athens: it can be brought from India for thesame cost.&apos; These charges bear hardly on the farmer and check industrialrecovery. There is a great shortage of road repairing machinery and littleis being done to mend the roads.The Corinth Canal is blocked up and the harbours are badly damaged.The port of Salonika is obstructed by sunken shipping. Repairs have-not yet started in any of these cases.1Over three-quarters of the Greek merchant fleet has been sunk, mainly in the service of the Allies, and the Greek Government have been unable-to obtain. ships from Great Britain. Negotiations for the purchase ofvessels from the United States have been opened but difficulties aboutpayment have arisen and negotiations have been slow.The fishing industry is inadequately developed and provides scope for substantial expansion. Less than 2 per cent, of the population of a, country with 2,500 miles of coast-line was employed in fishing prior to the war.The development of a fish-canning industry should be considered.Factories lack spare parts and machinery has deteriorated through lack&quot;of maintenance. Otherwise damage to industrial plants - has not beenexcessive. Employment is up to 80 per cent, of pre-war, but productivityis down, working conditions are bad, there is much discontent and theGovernments attitude towards the Trade Unions is not likely to increasethe cheerfulness or output of the workers. There are no reliable statisticsrelating to Unemployment but the number of people unemployed is-certainly considerable. There is an almost overwhelming shortage of rawmaterials.   1   &apos;Hand-work industries, such as hand-weaving, copper-work and silver-work should be encouraged and the possibility of developing hydro-electric-power considered.Unless production is increased the danger of inflation will be ever present.A Geo-Physical survey of the country is badly needed to ascertain howfar deposits of iron-ore, manganese, chrome, lead and other minerals can.be profitably developed.AgricultureGreece is mainly an agricultural country: 65 per cent, of the population,chiefly peasant proprietors and their families, live upon the land.   Warcaused great devastation.   Over 400,000 draught animals were slaughtered,or stolen by the Germans.    Olive trees and vineyards were destroyed.Villages were burnt down and hundreds of thousands of peasants displaced.Nevertheless great progress has been made.   The Greek farmer is hard-working and his whole family helps him in the field.   It is anticipated thatthe production of olives, wheat, cotton, nuts, tomatoes, rye, oats, driedfruits and citrus fruits in 1946 will amount to 90 per cent, of pre-war-production.   The production of dried beans will show a considerable increase-but there will be a substantial fall in eggs, meat and milk.The Tobacco crop half of which was formerly bought by Germany has fallen to less than one-third of its pre-war level.   Much of this hasbeen hoarded by the growers owing to their dissatisfaction with the pricesoffered by the merchants and their distrust in the stability of the drachma.Britain has just purchased  10 million worth of Macedonian tobacco.From the earliest times Greece has been a wheat-importing countryand normally she imports 600,000 tons of wheat annually. This requires-much foreign exchange. It has been suggested that less foreign exchangewould be needed if Greece grew potatoes instead of cotton. A large-proportion of the 70,000 tons of seed now imported could be produced athome. Canning factories should be set up in tomato growing areas. Timberis scarce and expensive, as in all Eastern Mediterranean countries, butthere is no reason why the existing forests should not be very greatly improved and extended provided goats are ruthlessly excluded from grazingin all forest areas. Greece is a dry country and large scale irrigation would produce enormous benefits: in fact the Director of the UN.R.R.A. Missionsaid that it might make her another California. Although Peasant Co-operatives exist there is need for an improved marketing system to enable -the peasant to get a better price for his products and to. free him fromexploitation by middle-men.It is self-evident that a programme of Reconstruction is urgently needed by Greece in which perhaps the Bank of Reconstruction could help.Estimates of the cost of repairing war-damage alone, without embarking on long-term schemes of development, vary greatly.   Some put the figure -
at  325 million; others at  1,000 million. In any case the amount mustbe a very large one. Only  5 million is allotted for Reconstruction in thecurrent Budget. This is ludicrously inadequate, but, owing to the fear1of inflation, it is the limit imposed for the time being by the BritishEconomic Mission.The Delegation interviewed the appropriate Ministries with a view to obtaining some detailed plans for Eeconstruction. No such plans appearedto be in existence.Economic and Social conditions the economic position of Greece and of a large proportion of the popula-tion is, by British standards, appalling.Greece is a poor country and the majority of the people live in conditionsof great hardship.This hardship is greatly accentuated at the present time by the extra-ordinary high prices which everywhere prevail.Bread is rationed but there is no general system of rationing or price control.  Nor does the machinery exist to work such a system.Eetail prices have gone up to 150 times their pre-war figure and more than-that in some cases.The price of wheat has been stabilised at 140 times pre-war.It is estimated that the cost of living has gone up 80 times.Wages have only gone up 60 times or less.A good general wage for a worker in the towns is 48s. to 54s. a week andmany earn less than that^1)But the minimum cost of maintaining a family of four is about 96s. ofwhich 58s. is the cost of food.Greek workers have the habit of taking work where they can find it andnot confining themselves exclusively to their own trades and this may help them to earn a little more in certain cases.In some industries attempts have been made to increase wages by paying the workers their wages in advance in the form of loans.But such a system cannot last and unless conditions are altered it would&apos;seem that industry must eventually be brought to a standstill.The peasant has always been poor but he can keep alive on the food he-produces.In the towns it is a different matter and it is obvious that without the free-U.N.R.R.A. supplies many thousands of workers and their families would,already have died of starvation.   There is no system of Public Assistance.If, as has been announced, U.N.R.R.A. supplies are to come to an endsomething will have to be put in their place or great masses of people will-starve to death.Greece&apos;s claims for food allocations should be strongly and competentlypressed before the International Emergency Food Council which is to take-the place of U.N.B.R.A.The Greek Government has not yet formulated its Wheat Policy and it is-not known whether the importation of wheat is to be a Government monopolyor whether importers are to be allowed to bring in whatever they can. Butit has been stated generally that it favours private enterprise and wishes toreduce State interference with trade and industry to a minimum.The Delegation, however, consider that in the present exceptional and&apos;critical situation a vigorous attempt should be made to introduce further priceregulation and a system of rationing.The Black MarketThere is an extensive Black Market in Athens and Piraeus. Goods from u.N.R.R.A. and N.A.A.P.I. are hawked about the streets and sold in the shops. There seems to be a grave deficiency in the law in respect to thesematters.The civil ServicePar too large a proportion of the Urban population is engaged in non-pro-ductive work and this constitutes a problem which requires earnest attention.It is stated that the number of people employed in the public services alonehas doubled since 1939.There is a large and badly paid Civil Service which is crying out for improvement.A Government clerk is only paid  2 a week with family allowances upto 25 per cent, of salary.Other grades are paid proportionately. The highest paid regular official of the State, the President of the Supreme Court, receives in salary and emoluments some  400 a year.(l) It is difficult to speak accurately of an average wage since wages in differentoccupations have risen unequally; for example, a dock worker, textile worker ormotor driver in Athens may earn 12s. to 15s. a day, whilst a skilled worker in someother trade may earn only half of this.Note. The rate of exchange is 20,000 drachmas to the paper pound and 137,000-to the gold pound.[32797J c
A Civil Service half as large and adequately paid, with greater indepen-dence and personnel selected for individual merit rather than for politicalopinions, would render far more efficient service than the present body.The British Economic Mission has advised the Greek Government to setup a Public Services Commission for recruitment to Government service.The Delegation agree with this recommendation but are of the opinion that acomplete reorganisation of the Civil Service is required.The Tax-Free RichAlthough there are no titles or social distinctions in Greece and thenatural atmosphere of equality that prevails is one of the most pleasingfeatures of Greek life there is a small class of wealthy people chiefly residing in and around Athens. Members of these families, to which many of theleading politicians belong, live in great luxury. They have gold pounds attheir disposal, each of which can be exchanged for 137,000 drachma?( 6 17s. 0d.) and so are indifferent to the high cost of living, and as thereis no Income Tax in the British sense they live practically tax-free.The lavish hospitality dispensed by these wealthy people, coupled with thedisplay of expensive goods in the shops in Athens, is apt to give the visitora false impression of the true financial state of the country.This state is critical.Budget UnbalancedGreece cannot pay for the imports she needs and her Budget is unbalanced.This year the Budget provides for an expenditure of  51,000,000 againsta Revenue of  30,000,000.This deficit of  21,000,000 has been reduced to  8,700,000 by adding to therevenue various non-recurring items such as proceeds from the sale of stores,which will not be available in future years.Less than  9,000,000 is being spent in Health, Welfare, Agriculture and education but  12,500,000 has been allotted to the Armed Forces (in additionto the cost of equipment which is partly paid by Britain) and  6,000,000 to public Security.On the Eevenue side only  4,600,000 is raised by direct taxation or 10s.per head, and  21,500,000 by indirect taxation or approximately  2 10s.per head.If the Budget is ever to be balanced in the future it is obvious thatmethods of taxation must be revised and taxes must fall primarily upon those best able to pay.Members of the wealthy class should no longer be exempt from sub-stantial direct taxation.The possibility of raising an internal Savings Loan should be considered.There appears to be no such Government official as the Auditor-General.Attention should be paid to the establishment of improved business routinein Government Departments, to the strict scrutiny of estimates and an equally strict auditing of accounts.Balance of TradeGreece has always had an adverse Balance of Trade, but in the past thedifference has been made up by:  1. Earnings of Greek shipping.2. Remittances from Greek emigrants abroad.3. Receipts from Tourist traffic.4. Foreign loans.The first two are heavily down and are likely to remain so for sometime, to&apos; come. The third does not at present exist and only the fourth, theprospect of which is hypothetical, remains.Greek exports in 1945 only amounted to  71,000. This year they areexpected to reach  6,250,000, of which amount more than half will berepresented by tobacco.But Greece requires to import large quantities of food, iron, steel,machinery, coal, petrol and raw materials, and Mr. Maben, head of theU.N.R.R.A. Mission, estimates that when U.N.E.R.A. supplies cease therewill be an adverse exchange balance of  25,400,000.Yet imports cannot be cut down materially without further loweringthe standard of living and reducing the chances of any revival of industry.Exports must be increased but Mr. Maben&apos;s view is that for this to bedone the drachma must be devaluated by almost 40 per cent, unless export subsidies are to be granted.The Delegation were disappointed to find that none of the political leadersof parties seemed to have any concrete plans for dealing with these problems.The prevailing view can be summed up not unfairly in a phrase &quot; Englandwill have to help us.&quot;The British MissionsThe British Economic Mission has done an important and successfuljob and has still more difficult tasks ahead of it. The Mission believes thatGreece, with help in personnel and money, could, in a matter of 10 years or so, become a country with a balanced budget and a balanced trade.
It may be that the powers of the Mission will have to oe widened in,order to achieve complete success. It is, perhaps, worthy of remark thatM. Zachariades, the Secretary of the Communist Party, stated that he was.in favour of the Mission remaining and that he thought Economic Collabora-tion between Greece and Britain could last 100 years.The impartiality of the Greek Gendarmerie has been questioned in many quarters, and as it is now actively engaged in fighting pitched battles withCommunist and Leftist bands it has naturally taken on the character of apartisan force. The British Police Mission and conditions of the Prisonsare referred to elsewhere in this Report.The British Military Mission is doing first-class work in organising andtraining the Greek Army. The Naval and Air Missions are living up to-the high traditions of their respective services.conclusion the Delegation have drawn what is perhaps a depressing picture of theGreek situation. They have endeavoured to set out what they have seen and heard in an objective and impartial way.They have seen a country where the degree of political disagreementean be measured by the number of political parties that exist and the degree of political animosity can be shown by the continuance offratricidal strife at a time when Greece needs the united efforts of all hersons and daughters to repair the damage caused by the War and to over-come economic dangers and difficulties of the most critical and pressingcharacter.They have seen in Greece; as in Classical days, a great and gifted people in danger of falling into ruin by rushing into extreme and violent courses,by neglecting to compromise and by failing to follow a policy of moderationand generous reconciliation.Yet the people of Greece are a gallant, gay and attractive race and afterthe tortures they have endured during the last five years they deserveprospects of a brighter, more prosperous and happier future.The Delegation believe there is an opportunity of achieving this if awise policy is adopted.Realising the immense influence which the British nation can exerciseover Greek opinion they put the following suggestions in addition to therecommendations made in the body of this Report before His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, and trust that they may be found worthy of serious consideration.recommendations i. That the opportunity given by the return of the King should be usedto initiate an entirely new policy in and towards Greece.2. That an All-Party Government should be formed, with the support ofGreat Britain, to include all sections with the possible exception of theextreme Left.3. That this Government, should it not be practicable to declare aGeneral Amnesty, should at least adopt a generous policy of Clemency,towards political offenders.4. That the first object of this Government should be the establishmentof Law, Order and internal Peace and the restoration of Constitutionalliberties.5. That the special security decrees should be cancelled and all personswho by order of the Security Committees have been exiled to the islands for political reasons should be allowed to return to their homes.6. That all persons surrendering their arms by a given date should befreed from the penalties attached to the illegal possession of arms.7. That further steps should be taken to improve the conditions in theprisons.8. That after a certain defined period new elections should be held onan up-to-date Register.9. That subject to considerations of strategy and high policy the Britishtroops should be withdrawn at an early date.10. That the action of the Government in appointing a new general council of Labour and nominating new Trade Union Executives should berescinded and that pending new elections the former elected representatives should be allowed to return to their duties.II. That as soon as possible new Trade Union elections should be held under the supervision of the T.U.C. or the W.F.T.U. and that the good offices of the latter organisations should be utilised to amalgamate the 2,225 smallTrade Unions in Greece into larger units.12. That it is urgently necessary that some plan should be devised tomeet the situation which will be created when U.N.R.R.A. ceases to operate at the end of the present year, and that the Greek Government should be pressed to appoint a representative to press Greece&apos;s claims for food allo-cations before the International Emergency Food Council.13. That concrete plans for Reconstruction, with priority for Harbours,Railways and Roads, should be adopted and pressed forward with the possiblehelp of the Bank of Reconstruction.[32797] o 2
14. That any future loans to Greece should only be granted on condition that the powers of the British Economic Mission are strengthened and thatit be advisable to ask the Greek Government to accept the appointment of aBritish Financial Adviser with the duty of recommending a drastic reform of the present system of Taxation.15.   That a system of Price Regulation and Rationing is urgently needed.16. That a drastic re-organisation of the Civil Service is called for and&quot;that, if possible, a British Civil Service Mission should be sent to Greece toassist in the work.17. That every possible assistance should be given to enable Greece toreplace her merchant ships which were lost in the war.18. That the Greek people should be more closely associated with thework of local administration and government.19. That the establishment in Greece of any regime which resembled.a Dictatorship would have fatal consequences.In conclusion the Delegation feel that the friendship which exists betweenthe Greek and British peoples has a precious and unique character, that nothing should be done to weaken it and that it should grow even closerwith the passage of Time.(Signed) SEYMOUR COCKS.E. R. BOWEN.LESLIE HALE.JOHN C. MAUDE.W. MONSLOW.W. M. R. VANE.EVELYN WALKDEN.RIDER BY W. M. R.  VANE, MP.While I do not wish to disagree specifically with the facts set out in anyparticular chapter of the report and while I accept the administrativerecommendations whole-heartedly, I do feel that over the political field thegeneral emphasis should be placed somewhat differently. As it has been drafted, I feel that the report is less than fair to the present Greek Govern-ment and tends to judge it too far by Western European and too little byEastern European standards. With all its faults, and they are many, it isendeavouring, in my opinion, to co-operate loyally with the British Missions,although under great provocation it is failing to resist the tradition of retaliation-tion against political opponents in which Eastern Europe has been educated.I feel too that the report under-estimates the after effects of the rebellion-of December 1944 and January 1945 and the suspicions that the Communists-and some of the E.A.M. leaders are in close contact with foreign countries andare not only disloyally organising the Left-wing bandits but also preparing to repeat their larger revolutionary experiment when opportunity offers.These suspicions may not be entirely well founded but they are widelybelieved.Finally, I feel that too much hope should not be placed on the possibilityof re-forming the Government as a very wide coalition. The recent electionsgave a majority to ,the Populist Party, whose claim to form a government can hardly be disputed. Although, under present circumstances, it would clearly be an advantage if some other groups now in Opposition would co-operate with the present Government, there is a great danger of intro--ducing new weaknesses and intrigues if the Coalition is made too wide. Inparticular, I feel that it would be a mistake if any special effort of British-diplomacy were made to bring about the inclusion of M. Sofoulis.(Signed) W. M. R. VANE.MEMORANDUM ON TRADE UNIONISM IN GREECEBy W. Monslow, M.P., and Evelyn Walkdkn, M.P.We found a state of crisis of recent development existing in the tradeunion movement in Greece. The work performed by Sir Walter Citrine andhis T.U.C. colleagues from January 1945 onwards had resulted in the holding of elections for Trade Union Executives, leading to the National Congressheld on 1st March, 1946. That Congress was attended by W.F.T.U. repre-sentatives, including Mr. G. H. Bagnall, of the T.U.C., who formally statedtheir satisfaction with the elections and with the composition of the Congress.It seemed at that time that a large measure of Trade Union unity had been achieved and that elections could thereafter be held annually, or as requiredfor the renewal of the various executives.But the legality of the position was challenged by the Greek High Court-at the instance of a representative of the Right-wing Reformist Group. Itshould be appreciated that under Greek law there is detailed legal definition of trade unions and their activities. The decision of the High Court was suchas to invalidate for legal purposes the National Congress and the elected trade
ibunion executives. It is important to realise that this invalidation was not-due to allegations of improper conduct of elections, of interference or of unduepressure. It rested solely upon the apparent breach of the constitution-arising from the issue by one of the many Ministers, of Labour (Zakkas) of a proclamation designed to provide representation of minority movements on various executives. Further, when it became apparent that this proeiama--tion was likely to be challenged, M. Louis Saillant, who was then present in-Athens, obtained the agreement of the leaders of the four Groups to withdraw their appeals and in fact they each signed a statement giving the necessaryundertaking.   The undertaking was not honoured.It is obvious that the Minister of Labour had no option but to endeavourto legalise the position of the trade unions as soon as possible, since any-common informer could have challenged their actions and their existence.The steps that he took, however, disposed of all argument, because aco-ordinated attack on each and every Union centre soon followed. Records.and papers were seized and all non-Nationals ejected. The Minister-nominated individuals to serve as provisional executives of the General Con-federation, the sixty workers&apos; centres, and he was proceeding to nominateprovisional executives for the 2,225 trade unions. In making these alloca-tions he did not re-appoint the former duly elected members, nor did heappoint members on a basis proportionate to the representation of the variousGroups arising from the elections. He took&apos; the opportunity of filling thevarious executives entirely with Right-wing (Reformist) members.(*) It was this Group which did not honour the undertaking to refrain from challengingthe earlier Ministers proclamation and it was this Group which, by abstain-ing from participation in the Congress, minimised the extent of trade unionunity which was so far secured.In the substitution and ejection of the elected executives there wereincidents which led to the arrest of four leading members who are now undersuspended sentences of imprisonment. But others, like the Bakers&apos; UnionPresident in Salonica, were and are still imprisoned for disturbing the peace or for security reasons.The elected members naturally claim that they are the rightful representa-tives of the workers. They have appealed to W.F.T.U. and M. Jouhaux(France) has brought their case before that body. It is no exaggeration tosay that this process of elimination is a distinct and definite purge of AllTrade Union Branch officials who hold Left-wing ideas. It is in keeping with the same process of elimination of Anti-Royalist and Left-wing opinion in the Armed Forces, the Gendarmerie and the Civil Service.In addition to the immediate short-term action which is called for, thereis a need to comment upon the general position for which long-termremedial and educative action appears to us to be advisable.During the course of our visit we met at Athens, Patras and Salonicarepresentatives of the various trade union Groups and we have formed theimpression that politics are the dominating motive in trade union activities,to the detriment of the conduct of the proper business of such bodies,namely, the cultivation of industrial relations, the development of wage negotiations, the improvement of the condition of the workers in the various industries. In the Patras area wholesale arrests of so-called agitators (twofrom each village) were openly admitted by the Nomareh. It was-abundantly clear that most of the persons now imprisoned for securityreasons in this area are ex local Trade Union Centre Leaders. Of 57 soimprisoned, 51 were former active Trade Unionists in their respectivevillages. At the moment there does not appear to be any collective bargaining machinery with employers as recognised in Great Britain. Onthe one hand there are various Government Orders regulating wages, but nevertheless there appear to be negotiations conducted mainly on a day today pressure basis.There is evidence that, in the not too distant past and, indeed, in many areas at present, the dominating trade union influence is Communist. we came to the conclusion, however, that this does not represent the realfeelings of the worker, of whom not more than 25 per cent, can be con-sidered to be of Communist sympathies. This should become evident assoon as properly conducted elections can be held, and it is the more essentialthat the current crisis referred to above should be quickly solved, if onlyto enable proper expression of the workers&apos; feelings to be given. But ifduly conducted elections are held and if the resultant trade union executives^concern themselves mainly with industrial problems, it is immaterial whichpolitical Group happens to predominate. Indeed, in view of the breakawayand disruptive tendencies shown by the Right-wing (Reformist) Group, inthe trade union world, it is the more essential that not too much emphasis should be laid upon political tendencies.We think that it is important that when elections have been held the recognition of the resultant bodies should be a matter for the W.F.T.U., in-addition to the legal establishment of their position inside Greece. Following-such recognition we express the view that the future of trade unionism in greece depends upon the measure of its concentration upon purely-industrial activities, i.e., a programme of working conditions should beprepared, industry by industry, and be made the target for its future work.(&apos;) To be strictly accurate he appointed a new g.cx. Executive consisting of-seventeen Nationalists and five members of the previously elected Executive, butthe latter refused to serve.
Steps should be taken to get national machinery established and we feel&quot;that competent persons in Great Britain, experienced in the structure oftrade unions (we would suggest not more than three), might be utilised in building such machinery. If this suggestion is adopted these persons should work in close collaboration with the responsible Labour Attache at the british embassy in Athens.Finally, there is no hope for the trade union movement in Greece, inour opinion, unless there is a desire on the part of the workers of Greece to -concentrate on industrial movement for improved economic conditions andnot, as at present, being subordinated solely to political machinations andintrigues.(Signed)      W. MONSLOW.EVELYN WALKDEN.MEMORANDUM ON CONDITIONS OF LAW AND ORDER IN GREECEBy Leslie Hale, M.P., and John C. Maude, KG, M.P.(1) The administration of the ordinary criminal law(a) The delegation had no opportunity of witnessing a criminal trial,because the Courts were not able to sit to hear cases during the weekspreceding the Plebiscite owing to the fact that the judicial officers were-needed for work in connection with the supervising of the Plebiscite. Thisinterruption in the ordinary work of the Criminal Courts led to addedcongestion of the lists of cases waiting trial which, at the time of our visit,was formidable.(b) The Judiciary are clearly held in high respect by the people of greece, and we found nothing to arouse any doubt as to the accuracy ofthe finding of the British Legal Mission to Greece that Greek methods of investigation and public trial are adequate and equitable.(c) It is clearly extremely difficult to speed up trials, because the salaries of the Judges are so low that it is virtually impossible to get abusy practising lawyer to act in the sort of capacity that members of the bar in England do when they go as Commissioner of Assize. It seems that the highest judicial salary with bonuses, family allowance, and service-pay amounts to a sum in the neighbourhood of . 400 per year.(d) It was not possible to make any extensive investigation to find outwhether persons accused of political banditry were able to find lawyers to-defend them, but we are inclined to think that on occasions this is probably-difficult.(2) The abnormal state of civil disturbance in Greece(a) It is not easy in the course of a short visit to obtain a clear view ofthe extent of the wave of violence which was prevailing in certain districts -of Greece at the time of our visit.There is, however, no doubt at all that a condition of lawlessness prevailsin certain areas which justifies the taking of exceptional measures by theAuthorities to prevent and punish murders and other acts of grave violence.(b) In certain areas outrages have been committed by bandits who aregenerally designated as of the Extreme Left, whilst in other areas similar -outrages are attributed to bandits of the Extreme Right.   For instance, inthe Peloponnese there appears to be an overwhelming predominance of theRight, and this area has been by no means free from disturbances, while in the neighbourhood of the Albanian, Yugoslavian, and Bulgarian frontiers.there is a marked predominance of the Left where many murders havetaken place.   The Government allege that arms for the Left are constantlysmuggled over the Northern Frontier, and that Left Wing bandits are able,when pressed, to take refuge across the Northern Frontier.   There can. be -little doubt that many of the allegations made by both sides of cruelty andatrocity are either grossly exaggerated or wholly without foundation, butthere are wide areas in which lawlessness of great gravity is almost a dailyoccurrence.(c) The members of the delegation were not warned by the GreekGovernment that it was dangerous to go out and walk about the townsat night, nor were they apparently given any sort of police protection inthe towns which they visited. We do not consider that such protectionwas necessary for the members of the delegation, but the Authoritiesthought that it was wise to afford the members of the delegation who -drove from Tripolis to Sparta one evening the added protection of a small body of gendarmes, which followed the motor cars of the delegation; on one occasion, in Tripolis after being assured by the local Chief of Police &apos;that absolute calm prevailed in the district, Mr. Hale took a walk and found a man of some 35 years of age, a former E.L.A.S. Officer, lying -murdered within a few yards of the local police headquarters. It was notestablished during our stay in Greece who had committed the murder.Attacks on gendarme posts were frequent in Northern Greece, and duringthe evening before the delegation left Salonika some seven gendarmes weremurdered, at a distance of about 30 miles from, the city. On arrival by air from Salonika at Larissa in Thessaly, the British and&quot;Greek authorities&apos;.
reported to us that fighting was going on between the police and a small body of bandits on the edge of the Plain of Thessaly at no great distance from Larissa.During our stay in Athens, the delegation were petitioned by the mother-of a man who had been murdered the previous day, after being taken out of a holiday camp in the suburbs of Athens at 3 o&apos;clock in the afternoon.i(3) The Special Powers taken by the Government to deal with the GrimeWave(a) The Greek Government have taken powers that are not dissimilarto our 18B procedure during the war. Under the procedure as set outin the Regulations, a suspect is arrested on a Warrant issued by the localPublic Prosecutor, who himself prepares the case, and interviews the witnesses. After arrest, the prisoner has no right to apply for bail, and indeed the Court is specifically prohibited from granting bail. There is nothing to prevent his being detained indefinitely without his case beingheard, and no doubt there is considerable delay. Where conditions oflawlessness prevail, it is sometimes extremely difficult to get witnesses toattend a hearing, and these hearings have to be adjourned very often forsuch causes. The Minister of Justice explained to the delegation that the accused always had the option of attending the hearing of his case, butthat he need not go unless he wished.We were of the opinion that it was unsatisfactory that the Prefect ofthe district should be a member of, and preside over, the Security Com-mittee, as well as (except in Athens), the Second Degree Public Security-Committee, which is a Court of Appeal for such cases. There is noobjection in our view to the formation of the Committee in any otherrespect, but we do consider it unfortunate that the Committee should notbe a judicial body entirely divorced from the executive. Powers of thiskind can only be justified by conditions which are completely and deplorablyabnormal. It is somewhat difficult to reconcile the suggestions that at-one and the same time the condition of si country is so peaceful as to warrant the holding of a Plebiscite, and at the same time so troubled asto necessitate the abrogation of much elementary liberty.(b) When We visited the prison in Sparta we gained the impression that a large proportion of the prisoners were detained by order of theSecurity Committee; many local Left-wing leaders were imprisoned,including the editor of the local newspaper, the President of the AgrarianLeft Party, a local teacher, a local barrister, and so on. Accordingly we^called for some statistics about the inmates of the prison; which showed that in Sparta prison there had been a total of 49 prisoners detained whosecases had been considered by the local Public Security Committee; all ofthese appealed, with the result that 19 were released; two had been informedthat the decision to deport them stood, and twenty-eight were awaiting the result of their appeals. Information was supplied to us that a furtherfifteen prisoners were also detained in the Sparta Police Station cells^awaiting the result of their appeals.We were further supplied with figures which show that,  since the^commencement  of  the   working of  these  Security   Committees   up to10th August, 1946, 573 prisoners had been deported, and 1,385 were awaiting the result of their appeals against deportation.(c) The delegation asked for figures in connection with the sentencespassed by the special Military Tribunals which have recently been active in macedonia and Thrace. Up to 21st August, 1946, 34 death sentences hadbeen passed, 33 sentences of life imprisonment, 21 heavy sentences of30-10 years, 22 medium sentences of 10-3 years, and 87 light sentences under3 years. As against this total of 197 convictions, the delegation thought thenumber of acquittals 55 impressive. Murders in the provinces of NorthernGreece during the period January-June 1946, that is to say Western Maee--donia, Central Macedonia, Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, totalled 143. An-analysis of the killings during the three months of May, June and July forCentral Macedonia, including Salonika, show figures for May of 15, June 30,and July 48, and of this total 14 were gendarmes, 4 rural guards, and16 soldiers.(4) The British Police MissionThis very small mission has clearly done admirable work. We noticed that relations were excellent between the officers of the Police Mission andthe officers and men of the Greek Town Police forces, as well as the-gendarmerie.The police mission has done a great deal to promote efficiency of the&apos;&quot;Greek Police, and we found it to be the subject of no sort of hostile commentby opponents of the Government.&apos;(o) Conditions of PrisonsIn addition to visiting the prison at Sparta, visits were paid to the two main prisons in Salonika and to two Police Stations in Athens, in both ofwhich convicted prisoners were serving short sentences. At the Asleroveprison in Athens, where the majority of prisoners were members of theE.L.A.S., it was stated that of the 300 prisoners accommodated in one section,
none had been tried, and some had been there for considerable periods. Con-ditions here were primative, but there was no sign of physical deteriorationamongst the prisoners. At the Casteros prison in the Piraeus, there wasgross over-crowding and strong evidence of physical deterioration; the atten-tion of the Minister of Justice was called to these conditions, and he declaredthat he would make an immediate investigation.The conditions in all the prisons visited were found to be primitive, butwe are satisfied that the Greek Government are anxious to improve both&apos;prison conditions and the prison system in general.. It seems impossible inview of the shortage of materials and labour as well as an absence of trained personnel, that any rapid improvement can take place. The prevailingsystem is quite unlikely, in our opinion, to have any sort of reformative effect..The present staffs at the gaols which we visited undoubtedly treated theirprisoners humanely and with understanding; this opinion is founded uponmany private conversations which we were able to have in prisons with individual prisoners of both sexes.(Signed) LESLIE HALE.JOHN C. MAUDE.(SECRET)SOME NOTES ON THE MILITARY situation by W. M. R. Vane, M.P.general. The problem of the defence of Greece is, unfortunately, no nearer a*solution in 1946 than it was in the last century when the Eastern question,was so prominent in all diplomatic discussions. Nor was it only a Greek,problem because, from its very situation, British interests are ineyitablyinvolved. Greece not only lies on the flank of British sea communications to-the East but has to-day become an important air staging post. In addition,she bars the Slav road to the ^aegean and the Mediterranean Seas. Posses-sion of Salonica remains, as ever, a Slav dream, but one that need not be so.far from realisation if advantage were taken of one of the many excuses forinterference which could be found. For instance, Macedonia might be treated1as a second Azerbaijan. However, two British Divisions are still in greece and they cannot be overlooked although they do not form a co-ordinatedfighting force. Finally, British interest in Greece is likely to grow stronger-as British control in Egypt grows weaker.2. One day Greece may be able to follow a middle course which allows-close and friendly economic relations with both the Western Powers and the-Russian Group. To-day this is unfortunately a complete impossibility..Greece cannot stand alone militarily any more than she can stand aloneeconomically. She must make a grim choice. There is no doubt that she would prefer to work closely with Britain and the Western Powers rather-than with the Slav Group but this cannot be safeguarded without some military help. Nor do any of her leaders appear to place any immediatetrust in the power of U.N.O. to help her. Most of them, in fact, feel that failure on the part of Britain and the West to help Greece would spell her-extinction since the alternative close contact with Russia would lead to a communist State, which would be little else than a close dependency ofRussia.3. The present situation is an artificial one since the temporary presenceof British troops gives a false idea of security. No ruling has yet beengiven as to the length of time they are likely to stay and there is real danger that their withdrawal may be determined as much by the sentimental case for &quot; bringing the boys home as by the true interests of imperial strategy.It is much easier to create interest in Parliament for something homely andsentimental than for something which is less easy to understand but none theless vital.4. The presence of British troops in Greece has been explained many times. We are not trying to impose any special Government on Greece but merely anxious for the Greek people to choose freely their own Governmentand for their own police services to have time to reform and train.This is undoubtedly true as far as it goes.   But it is also in the british interests that Greece should remain free and independent.   Hence the role of British troops as a deterrent against aggression is as much a British as.a Greek interest.5. It is certain that Greece can never maintain sufficient armed forces to defeat an attack from her Northern neighbours receiving Russian aid. she has neither the man-power nor the money resources to attempt to raise and maintain such forces. Hence, until U.N.O. can shoulder heavier responsi-bilities than at present, Greece must seek for Allies. To-day Britain is committed as the main ally of Greece but it does not seem clear what help-&apos;might be forthcoming in any given circumstances.
Greek Armed Forces6. To-day, as in the past, Greece relies in the main on her army. These-notes are mainly concerned with her army but reference must also be madeto her other two armed Services. At present there is a British Missionattached to each of the Greek Services, and since all these come under asingle Minister of Defence, there is a great chance of overcoming thedamaging inter-Service suspicions and merging parts of all three supply andadministrative services. This would be in the interests of efficiency but itis not clear whether it is British policy to encourage this.. 7. In general the Greek makes a good fighting man. He is full of ideas and imagination. Unfortunately there is a political tradition in the services which is ruinous to efficiency. The British Missions should be given credit for being on the way to overcoming this but it is too deeply ingrained to be easily forgotten Greek service officers are too inclined to over-value&quot; prestige &quot; and dream about the past rather than plan for the future. Theyare very poor administrators.Navy8. Owing to her geographical position, it is wholly reasonable that Greece-should continue to maintain a Navy. It is unreasonable, however, to give way to prestige and plan to possess big ships and submarines. Greece&apos;s need is clearly.for smaller ships and, in particular, landing craft.The suggestion that the Greek Navy should be looked on as an echelonof the British Navy, with equipment to fight Navies like those of Italy andGermany, during the late war, is totally unsound and will simply land theBritish taxpayer in useless expense.The Greek Navy suffers from too many senior officers.The tradition of a British Mission is an old one and commands greatconfidence.Air Force9. The Greek Air Force is organized very closely on the British model.It -is very small but keen. Its Squadrons fought under British Commandas part of the R.A.F. during the war.To-day they are becoming depressed. Their pay is low and their equip-ment obsolescent. Politically it leans a great deal further to the left thanthe other two services.In view of the nature of the country, its training should be based on.close co-operation with the Army rather than use as an entirely separate-service and Britain should not be so stingy with the provision of equipmentprovided this end is kept in view.Landing grounds in Greece will always present a problem owing to the-mountainous nature of most of the country but Britain should aid theprovision of extensive aerodrome facilities at least where we need themfor staging purposes.   It therefore appears that. British help will always be available even if not designated as a Mission.Army10. Before the 1939-45 war the Greek Army was assisted by a french military Mission. Both organization and equipment were French andemphasis was rightly laid on mountain warfare.During the war the old Greek Army and its equipment have been,totally dispersed and a fresh start was made in the Middle East to forma new Army based on British organization and equipment.Mutinies, fomented by political agitations, caused serious setbacks butelements of this force reached Greece in the autumn of 1944. To-day astrong British Military Mission is engaged in building a new conscript Armyon the British model. It can be presumed that this Mission will remain for a number of years although no decision has been taken.The British Parliament should take the closest interest in the workof this Mission since its success or otherwise should largely govern the-time when British troops may be withdrawn and its advice to HisMajesty&apos;s Government may govern the amount of financial help Britainwill have to give Greece.11.   The present state of the Greek Army:  (a) Size. 80-100,000 recruited on a conscript basis.(b) Organization. The British Army is taken as a model.   Greece is divided into three  Corps District  Commands.    Divisions  are either mountain or field.(c) Morale and Politics. Morale is good and rising.   Politics can never be entirely excluded from a Balkan Army. To-day&apos;s Greek army is probably the least political in her history. There is no discrimination against republicans as such but a check is kept ondisloyal communist agitators. A communist organisation forundermining the Army exists.(d) Training. The chief problem is the training of technicians without which equipment cannot be issued without waste.   This lag may[32797]    &apos; d
continue until Spring 1948. Although organized in formations,most Greek units have not reached the level of battalion or equivalent training.(e) Equipment. There is sufficient equipment to complete all units towar scale but most of it is held in the Base Ordnance Depotsince units are unable to maintain it on account of lack of trained specialists.(/) Reserves. A reserve of trained manpower is building itself upautomatically. There is no large reserve of equipment nor moneyto pay for even part of the cost of such a reserve.Finance12. Britain has borne the prime cost of all equipment and the greaterpart of the maintenance cost to date. Excluding the cost of the military mission, this has amounted to more than  11 million. It happened thatthis equipment was available either in Greece or Italy and consideredsurplus. There is therefore an obvious need for a definite policy regardingfuture maintenance costs and the provision of any reserves. The presenthand to mouth policy is neither fair to Greece nor Britain.It is doubtful whether Greece can ever bear the full maintenance costs of her three forces even on the present modest planHence a situation can easily arise where Britain pays wastefully large sums on Greek forces which will never be effective. Our policy shouldbe to aim at making the Greek forces effective within modest limits and;at a minimum cost. They should not be expected tr fight alone and beatthe forces of a combination of small powers.13.   A possible role of the Greek Army:  In normal times :  (a) Aid the civil power in the maintenance of Internal Security.(6) Control of the frontiers including infiltration of armed bands.In case of invasion:  (c) Ability to fight a delaying action against attack from the Northby one or more enemies.It is suggested that Greece alone could never defeat a prepared invasionand would need help. In due course this would be a U.N.O. responsibility and even to-day would surely develop from a situation calling for discussion and preparation and would not be launched as a complete surprise. Greecetherefore should expect her army to be a deterrent to a surprise attack anda force which would oppose a prepared attack until aid could reach her. Thisrole would not need general mobilization nor great reserves of her own.It would need immediate help which at present could only be givenby the British air force in the Middle East rapidly moved to operate fromlanding grounds in Greece,Present Bole of the British Army in Greece14. (a) Maintenance of public morale,(b) Deterrent against aggression.-Greek Opinions on the Presence of the British Army in Greece15.-(a) Political.(i) Left. All Left politicians seem agreed in wanting the british army withdrawn.(ii) Centre. Opinion is less clear here.   If the Centre were in powerit is likely that they would wish the British to stay.(iii) Bight. The present Greek Government seem anxious for theBritish army to stay in order to fulfil the role of a deterrentagainst aggression.  There is a genuine fear of trouble from theNorth if the British army is withdrawn at an early date,i (b) MilitaryGreek senior officers are anxious about possible developments if theBritish Divisions are withdrawn this autumn. Unlike politicians of the eight, professional pride prevents them from wanting British forces to stay indefinitely but they would like to see the Greek army better trained and equipped first. The general feeling is that the situation should be. reviewed next Spring in the light of progress made with the peace treaties.They also stress that Greek units cannot act as a deterrent until theycan handle their complete complement of equipment.One Greek officer stressed the clangers in very large-scale infiltrationof armed men from the North, who, in co-operation with the disloyal &apos;elements in Greece, including in the army, might, under present condi-tions, capture Salonika in spite of the presence of the Greek army.British Opiwions on the Value of the British Forces in Greece16. The majority opinion holds that a token force is necessary for sometime to come and stresses the value as a deterrent of even the smallest force which would in itself be of no great value in case of invasion.
An important minority view holds that the Greek army should be capableof looking after internal security and the control of its frontiers by the lateautumn 1946, and that the British army&apos;s morale raising presence will thenno longer be necessary. Those who hold this opinion argue that a deterrentagainst aggression can be effectively provided by the R.A.F. now in greece and elsewhere in the Middle East.-Summary of Recommendations17. The great need in Greece is for a clear policy and three early decisions should be taken to clear the vague atmosphere and end whatlooks like becoming an expensive hand to mouth military programme:  (a) The first decision should be the disentangling one of separatingBritish from purely Greek interests. Until this is done no financialplan is possible and nothing is more wasteful than subsidisingineffective forces, viz., throwing good money after bad.(6) The role and size of the three Greek Services should be agreed andthe amount of help of all kinds which they can expect to receive from us over a period of years should be made clear. Absurdlyambitious projects should not be subsidised.(c) Lastly, it is essential to reach an immediate decision about theminimum stay of the British Forces in Greece. The present uncertainty is bad for Greeks and British alike. Particularly isit unfair to the British private soldier. If British forces are toremain in Greece during the coming winter, expenditure on theimprovement of quarters should be authorised at once.Finally, if it is decided that British interests in Greece are vital, and atthe same time that the British Army should be withdrawn, a substitutedeterrent must be found. This can only be the clear declaration that anyviolation of the Greek frontier would be met immediately not only by theGreek forces but by the British and/or others as well. This, of course,would first mean the B.A.F. in strength operating from . prepared bases in Greece.
