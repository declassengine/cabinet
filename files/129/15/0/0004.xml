memorandum agreed by officials jofjph1treasury, fqreign&quot;&quot;&quot;of&quot;pice, ministryof&quot;f&quot;o*od* and control &quot;office&quot; for germany and austria1.      At the Cabinet on 25th November Ministers consideredthe American plan for sharing the costs of the British and american zones of occupation in Germany on a basis of equality and they authorised the Secretary of State toaccept t his p 1 an svTb ject to the f o 11 owing conditions :-(i)    That the burden on-the United Kingdom inUnited States dollars and other hardcurrencies he limited to 300,000,000dollars.(ii)    That -the proposed  joint Anglo-Americanimport-export agency &quot;be instructed tosecure supplies for the two zones ofGermany from easy currency countrieswherever possible even if supplies from these sources cost more than fromhare currency sources.(iii)    That the Americans from&apos;now onwards fullyimplement food pooling in the combinedzone wiping out all previous loantransactions of wheat,  flour,  etc.  froma supply point.of view,(iv)    That the United States assume responsibilityfor the procurement in the United Statesof such food supplies to the two zonesas must be obtained from United Statessources.(v)    That it he clearly understood &quot;that no. impediment should be placed by the americans on the policy of socialisingthe Ruhr induetries.(vi)    That it be confirmed that repayment for what has been spent and will he spenton providing approved imports into germany shall be effected in the shortestpracticable time consistent with the rebuilding of the German economy onhealthy non-aggressive linos.(vii)    That the working of the Agreement be reviewed at the end of 192-1-7 so as toensure that we are not finally committedbeyond that time.

2.      As a result of further discussions in washington and New York,  concluding with an interview between theForeign Secretary and Mr.   Byrnes on 30th November,  our negotiators have secured modification of the earlierAmerican proposal in certain respects with a view to meeting the above points.      The Foreign Secretary has reported on the position in his telegram Nos.  2150 and2151 from New York and the text of a draft Agreementembodying the  latest proposals has &quot;been circulated tothe Cabinet,.      A supplementary agreement regarding thesettlement of past transactions and. other financialdetails which have some hearing on the financial positionof the Agreement has also been circulated.      Thissupplementary agreement raises no points of principle.3. As the matter now stands the -position on the points made &quot;by the Cabinet at their meeting of 25th November isas follows:- &apos;(i)    Limitation of dollar liabilityThe circumstances which have made itnecessary for us to request thatthere should be a limit on our dollarliability Nave been fully explained to the U.S.  administration and are wellappreciated by the American negotiators.As the Foreign Secretary has reportedin his telegram No.  2150,  paragraph 2,from Now: York, Mr. Byrnes has statedthat there is rib possibility at all of congress agreeing to such an arrangement and in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s view thisanswer must be considered as final.(ii)    Reduction of doliar costs the U.S. Administration is,  howevers preparedto undertake to assist in minimising our dollar liability.      Accordingly the americans have agreed to the followingclause being inserted in the Agreement(paragraph 8):    &quot;Unless otherwise agreed,subject to the provisions of thisparagraph,  procurement shall be from themost economical sources of supply.However,  these sources shall be selectedto -the fullest extent practicable so as&quot;tominimisc the drain oh thb&quot;dollar resourcesof the United Kingdom. &quot;      Members &quot;&quot;of theUnited States Administration concerned are ready to pursue this policy within reasonable limits and the Secretary of State is convincedthat it would be useless to insist on more-explicit wording (o.g.  that the objectiveshould he pursued regardless of cost)  inorder to cover this   joint.

( iii)    Pooling and Repayment ox&apos; supplies the Agreement as it stands provides for fullpooling of all indigenous resources and imports.      Moreover,  as regards past loans,General Clay has given General Robert sonthe specific assurance that once theAgreement is signed there v/ill &quot;fee no questionof physical repayment &quot;by the United Kingdomzone of the 50,000 tone of wheat which was- recently &quot;borrowed from the U.S.  zone, thoughfinancial adjustment will bo necessary inace or da&apos;.1 ce &quot;with the terms of the Agreement.There are earlier loans of grain still outstanding amounting to some 12 and Lh,000tons with respect to which our negotiatorsin New York have been instructed to obtain a similar assurance.( iv)    Pr ocur ernent in U. S. A.It will be seen that the last sub-paragraph ofparagraph 8 of the draft Agreement providesthat  &quot;whore the financial responsibility rests with one Government and the designated source of supply is the territory under the authorityof the other Government the latter,  if sorequested, will accept responsibility forprocuring those supplies as agent for theformer.&quot;     This would appear to meet theCabinet 1s condition.      American agreement tothis paragraph is however,  still subject to confirmation from Washington.(v)    Socialisation of RuhrThe Americans have stated that they will raise no objection to the policy ofsocialisation of the Ruhr industries I provided that  the initiative for thisI move comes from the Germans.      In his telegram No.  2151 from New York,   theForeign Secretary expresses the view&apos;&apos; that it would be impossible to obtain,and inadvisable to press for,  categoricalassurances on this point from the presentAmerican administration given, the predominant Republican character of thenew Congress.

(vi)    Repayment  of CostsParagraph 6(e)  of the draft Agreement lays down that &quot;The easts incurred by the twoGovernments for their two zones beforefirst January,  19h7, and for the areathereafter shall be recovered, fromfuture Gorman exports in the shortestpracticable time consistent with. rebuilding of the Gorman economy onhealthy non-aggressive lines. 11(vii)    Annual review the draft Agreement (paragraph 12)provides for annual review out in termsIwhich do not permit  of the denunciation ofthr  arrangement save by mutual agreement.The Foreign Secretary considers(telegram&apos;Ho.  2150 paragraph 7) that itwould &quot;be a fatal mistake to ask for morethan this.      If the arrangement onlycovered one year there would he n greatrisk that  the america would only agreeto renew it on terms less favourable to ourselves particularly since I9J4.8 is theyuar of the Presidential elections.Furthermore, Mr,  Byrnes has. told himemphatically that if our commitment-did not extend definitely beyond oneyear,  this fact would have to. hecommunicated to Congress and theAgreement would then be rejected by them as inconsistent with a three year plan tomake Germany solvent.h. Our negotiators in. vg.w York and Washington have laidparticular emphasis on the following two points(a) That as a result of the negotiations inwhich they have been engaged they are convinced that there is every Intentionon the wart  of the present U.S.Administration to cany out the Agreementwith the greatest goodwill and inparticular those points relating to the safeguarding of our dollar position towhich Ministers attach special significance.Goodwill is of particular importancebecause the mechanism of supply andprocurement are necessarily not covered&apos; in the Agreement and will have to be worked out.(b) That it is a necessary result of the proposed arrangements  that the Americans have as muchinterest as ourselves in making the schemework&apos; and in making Germany a paying concernin the shortest possible time.-h-

5-      The Foreign Secretary has ashed for authority to conclude the Agreement as now draftee! subject to textualamendment at his discretion.      He desires a reply as early as possible on Monday and hopes that the Agreement may be signed by himself and Mr. Byrnes in Now York early on tuesday morning American time,  so that it can bo announcedhere in the House of Commons immediately after signatureat 3.30 p.m.  on Tuesday cur time.      It Is thought that therewill be a joint press conference in New York soon aftersignature at which the text of the Agreement will be handed to the Press.      The Foreign Secretary gives as one of themain reasons for urgency that the Council of foreign ministers may bo taking German questions on Tuesday orWednesday and that unless a firm agreement has beenreached with the Americans before than there will very likely be some Russian counter proposals designed to delay and impede the successful implementation of fusion.
