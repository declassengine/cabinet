hfA152(THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETJoint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs and the Secretary of State for Indiat,. The views of the Governments of Canada, Australia,New Zealand and India on the United States proposal for procedure by interim directives have been sought.      The telegrams sent tothese Governments at the end of November were based generally on the material and recommendations in Annexes A and B to cp. (h6) hh3;    it was explained that they contained a summaryof official views, formulated as a preliminary to fullMinisterial consideration.2. The replies received, which are summarised below,and the full texts of which are contained in Annexes I to IV ofthis paper, indicate that the Governments of New Zealand andIndia are ready to accept the United States proposal.      The  -Government of Canada advocate reference of the matter to theCouncil of Foreign Ministers.      The Commonwealth Governmentsuggest that an earlier proposal by the United States Governmentfor a Reparations Conference should be pressed to a vote in the far Eastern Commission,  so that the Soviet attitude can be clearly established.      If the Soviet then veto the inclusionof Japanese external assets in the discussions,  the commonwealth government contemplate that these would be dealt with separately (see B(c) below).A.    Canada_( see Annex I)(a) The Canadian Government agree thut a decision on- levels of industry in Japan should precede adecision on reparations.(b) They regard the United States plan as an evasionof the appropriate international machinery for handling the problem and that its adoption,  if russia refused to participate, would haveundesirable effects on the Par Eastern Commission,or other similar international bodies and indeedon all political fronts.CP. (h6) 45713th December,  19h6CABINETJAPANESE REPARATIONS DEADLOCKThey do not  regard the failure of the United States-U.S.S.R. bilateral negotiations as in itself asufficient reason for resort to the procedure of interim directives.

(d) They suggest that the question of the jurisdiction of the Par Eastern Commission to deal with Japanf external assets,  in addition to her internal.   assets,  shall be referred to the Council of foreign ministers,  who might also be asked to indicate thegeneral manner in which the allocation of japanese reparations should be made.(e) They ask for  the United Kingdom Government&apos;s viewson (d) and whether&apos; they would be prepared tosponsor the placing of the question on the agenda of the Council Of Foreign Ministers,  if . the FanEastern Commission favoured the proposal.(f) A possible alternative would be to try to settle the whole matter in the Far Eastern Commission bysome such device as ignoring external assets and giving the U.3.S.R. only a token allocation of japan&apos;s internal assets.B.    Australia (See Annex II)(a) The Commonwealth Government agree that a settlementof the level of Japanese industry should precedereparations discussion.(b) They are opposed to any by-passing of the ParEastern Commission and think that the proposal made by the United States early in October fora Reparations Conference outside the Far eastern commission,  its decisions, however, to be subjectto the Commission&apos;s ratification,  should be pressed to a Vote in the Commission.(c) If the Soviet Government veto  the inclusion of japanese external assets within the scope of theConference,  such assets could be dealt with separately at the diplomatic level.      A broad plan for the division of internal assets among allclaimant countries could have been drawn up in theFar Eastern Commission and the detailed percentageallocations worked out at a subsequent Conferenceof all Far Eastern Commission countries, under the aegis of &quot;Che Commission.(d) They would strongly deprecate further purelybilateral   negotiations outside the Far EasternCommi ssion.C.-   New Zealand (See Annex III)(a)    The New Zealand Government agree  that a settlementof the level of Japanese industry is urgent butsuggest that reparations might be dealt with onan interim level without prejudicing the formerque stion.(b)      Though admittedly there are objections to theUnited States proposal,   they think that  on balanceit offers a practicable solution and have already authorised their Representative on the Far eastern commission to agtee to it, if the United Statesdecide to proceed with it and if other countriesagree to participate.

-    1S4d.    India (See Annex IV)(a) The Government of India share New Zealand&apos;s viewat III(a) above as to the levels of industry.(b) While they appreciate the. probable adverse effectof the United States plan on relations with Eussiaand on the status of the Par Eastern Commission,they regard the solution of this reparations problem as urgent and have authorised their Representative.-on the Par Eastern Commission to agree to any plan for a speedy allocation which has the support ofthe majority of interested countries.(c) They concur generally in the lines of the aiggestedcommunication to the United States State Department(see Annex &quot;B&quot; to CP. (46) 443).      They think thatthe alternatives may be either to accept the UnitedStates plan,  or,  if the plan is not accepted,  tosee the United States issue  the directives on theirown initiative and without consultation with othermembers of the Commission.A.P. -Ij .13th December,   1946

.-annex I *****g.QPy of Telegram No. Jijg^tgrT^ jth December,194-6, from the QanadlaiT Government to theDom In i on s&apos; Of f i c eYour telegram No.  221  of 7th. December.      japanese reparations.1* 0ur Views on the United States plan to solve theproblem of Japanese reparations by the issuance of interimdirectives after consultation with interested Governments maybe summarised as follows:(a) While this procedure may be correct under the ParEastern Commission Terms of Reference,  it neverthelessconstitutes an evasion of the appropriate international machinery for handling japanese reparations.      The plan,  if carried &quot;out,&apos; will undoubtedly have an undesirable effect on the prestige and authority of the Par Eastern Commission inparticular,  and on-other similar international bodies in general.      While Japanese reparations are primarilya matter of regional interest,  failure to reach asolution acceptable to all nations concerned willhave serious repercussions on all political fronts.(b) Of the various considerations mentioned by the UnitedStates in favour of an early settlement of the reparations question, we regard the stabilisation ofthe Japanese economy at peacetime levels&apos; as by far themost important.      We agree with you that the decisionon levels of industry in Japan should precede,  and not follow,  a decision on reparations.(c) While we fully appreciate the patient efforts made bythe United States Government over a considerable period to reach some basis of agreement with Russia,and recognise their right to issue interim directiveson matters they consider urgent, we do not believe that failure in these bilateral conversations is asufficient reason for the United States to resort atthis stage to the action proposed.      We believe thathope for settling this problem with the concurrence of the U.S.S.R.  should not be abandoned while thematter has still not been referred to the Councilof Foreign Ministers,2. It appears that,  so long as the U.S.S.R.  are disposed to question the 1 uri8dictio.il of the Par Eastern Commission overJapanese external assets,  there is no prospect of settling this problem within the Commission if external assets are to be takeninto account.      It would therefore seem appropriate that thequestion of the CommissionTs jurisdiction should be referred for decision to the Council of Foreign Ministers, by whom the commissions Terms of Reference were drawn up in December,  19U5*We recognise of course that a simple decision on the jurisdiction of the Far Eastern Commission will not necessarily settle theproblem.      The Council of Foreign Ministers might,  however, be requested at the same time to indicate the manner in which theallocation of Japanese reparations is to be made.      We have inmind the possibility that some settlement on the European pattern

might &quot;be worked out,  allocating a fixed percentage of reparations from within Japan to the Soviet Union,  and leaving the way open for the Far Eastern Commission to work oat thedetails after the main points at issue, had been settled, by theCouncil of Foreign Ministers.3. In our opinion, the U.3.3.r.  have been rather less   &apos;intractable in the Far Eastern Commission than in some other international bodies in which they participate,  and we feel thatit would be regrettable for the United States to prejudicefuture Russian co-operation In-the Commission by using theproposed strategy to evade Soviet opposition In the reparationsquestion.      It would appear- preferable to have this reparationsissue referred to the Foreign Ministers now, rather than risk thepossibility that the U. S.. Sill, might,  as an injured party,  raiseit In the Council at a later date    if the United States carry out their present plan.q. We would appreciate your views on this suggestion,  andwould like to know whether the United Kingdom Government would, be willing to sponsor the placing of this matter on the agenda of.the Council of Foreign Ministers.      We would not wish, to proposethis move in the Commission unless there is some assurance thatthe Council would be willing to consider it.5. In the meantime we feel that every effort should bemade In the Far Eastern Commission to speed the work onestablishing levels of Industry in Japan.6. We have informed our representative on the Far eastern commission that. If when the work on the levels of Japaneseindustry is complete,  no satisfactory ruling on the questionof external assets or the allocation of reparations shares,has yet been received from the Council of Foreign Ministers,we would consider the time to be riper for consideration of theUnited States proposal to draw up interim directives regardingthe removal of reparations to needy countries.7. We would not be averse to the settlement of the whole problem in the Commission by some practical face-saving devicewhich would tacitly ignore external assets,  and give the U.3.3.R.a token allocation of reparations from within Japan.

ANNEX IIQQEX-MJZelgEZmJtito- Jill, dated 10th Dec enter,19U-b, from the Australian government to theDominions Office  :Addressed Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs No.b15repeated Australian Embassy Washington No.  1736.  repeatedExternal Wellington No.  297.Your telegram No. 37h. Japanese reparations.Our approach is based on following principles:(a) We are opposed to any action to by-pass F.E.C.jurisdiction and to depart from the Moscow Agreement.(b) We feel that original proposal for ReparationsConference outside P.E.C. machinery but,  subject to P.E.C.ratification of decisions, was soundly based on reasoning that.E.C. machinery is too cumbersome for speedy decisions.&quot;(c) It seems to us that proposal for that conference should be pressed to a vote on F.E.C.      It is not sufficient thatthe bilateral U. S.A.-Soviet discussions reached a. deadlock.(d) Decision by P.E.C.   on level of economic life shouldprecede detailed discussion on reparations.2* We are therefore giving consideration to authorising the Australian P.E.C.  re p res representative i ve to p r oceed on foilowin glines:(a) Press for P.2.C.  decision on level of economic life asmatter of urgency in advance of any further discussion on reparations.(b) Press for F.E.C.  vote on proposal for a ReparationsConference.      This should be done in such a way that if Sovietshould veto inclusion of external assets within the scope of detailed discussion of reparations,  it will not prevent the implementation of the next stage.      In that event, externalassets can he dealt with, as a separate issue at diplomatic level.(a)     Propose for P.S.C.  discussion the following broad plan for allocation of internal assets.(I) A proportion of the total to be set aside to covercosts of occupation.      This amount will be divided among thecountries providing occupation forces in the proportion oftroops contributed by each.*      (II) The remaining quantity to be divided among allclaimant countries,  including those not members of P.E.C.(d)      If the broad plan set out in (c) should be approved, aConference of all P.S.C. member countries under P.E.C. aegisshould then proceed to determine the percentages to be allotted to each claimant country.

34 This approach&apos;is considered to he substantially in agreement with views expressed in your paragraph (2).With reference to your paragraph 5 however, we consider thatwe should not indicate our attitude on the question ofco-operation with the U.3.A.,  in the preparation of interimdirectives outside P.E.C., until the Soviet attitude hasbeen fully established in P.3.0.      We regard purely bilateralnegotiation outside P.S.C.  jurisdiction as most undesirable1.-7-J

ANNEX IIICopy of Telegram No, 313 dated 7th December, 1946from the New Zealand Government to the DominionsOfficeAddressed Secretary of State for DominionAffairs No.   313,  repeated H. C.  for New Zealand,  Ottawa No.  304,H.-C.  for New Zealand Canberra No.  229, N. Z.  Legation,Washington No.   749.1. Your telegram No.  290 of 29th November.      japanese reparations.      Our representative on Par Eastern commission had memorandum handed to him on 6th November,  1946 by Vincent,Chief of Par Eastern Division State Department, which contained a proposal apparently identical with that referred to in yourtelegram for breaking reparations deadlock.2, Memorandum asked for indication whether New zealand government would participate in consultations in the event ofUnited States Government deciding to proceed on the basisoutlined in the memorandum.3. We instructed our Minister on ISth November,  1946that he might inform the State Department that if the UnitedStates Government decided to proceed on those lines and othercountries agreed to participate, we would also be willing tojoin in consultations of the kind referred to.    While weforesee some&apos; objections  to the proposal, we think that on balance it offers a practicable way out of the deadlock.      we agree that a decision on levels of industry in Japan is amatter for early attention and that in general this shouldprecede and not follow a decision as to reparations.      It mayhowever be possible to deal with reparations on an interim basiswithout prejudicing the question of levels of industry.

ANNEX IVCopy *f Telegram No.   1033 9 elated 8th December,   1946from the Government of India to the Secretary ofState for India.Your telegram 20987 dated 30th November.      japanese reparations.2, Our general vie?/s are as follows -(l)       We are anxious to avoid by-passing Russia in viewof adverse consequences  to general political relations and status of Par Eastern Commission.(2)      At the same time we cannot envisage an indefinitepostponement of solution of reparations problem for reasons which are well known and need not be repeated.(3)        It may not be essential to come to a final decisionon level of Japanese industry before the issue of directivesfor interim removals.      During consultations preliminary toissue of these directives it will however be necessary to make sure that the interim programme does not conflict with generalpolicy regarding the level of Japanese industry which is at thesame time being discussed on Par Eastern Commission,      that discussion should be speeded up in order to face the issue of interim and final reparations directives.(4)      As stated in our telegram 9773 dated 16th Novemberit appears that alternatives before us will be either to acceptthe invitation for prior consultation before issue of U,S.directives or,  if we refuse,  to see these directives issuedwithout our having been consulted.      The primary responsibilityfor procedure vis-a-vis the Russians lies with U. S.  Government.(5)     We have instructed our representative on Par eastern commission to concur with any plan for speedy allocation of reparations which has support of majority of interested countries.(6)     We agree in general with line which you propose totake in replying to State Department as outlined in yourparagraph 5,3. We should be grateful if you would telegraphconclusion of Ministers repeating to Bajpai.
