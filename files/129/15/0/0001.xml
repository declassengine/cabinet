Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1946SECRET Copy No.     29CP. (46) 43527th November, 1946CABINETAGRICULTURE bill memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and FisheriesI submit herewith for the approval of my colleagues the draft AgricultureBill designed to give legislative effect to the Government&apos;s Agricultural Policywhich was approved by the Cabinet on 13th November, 1945 (CM. (45) .52ndConclusions, Minute 2) and which I announced in the House on 15th November,1945. The objective of this policy is to promote a healthy and efficient agriculture.The broad lines of policy have been discussed with, and generally accepted by,the different sections of the agricultural industry (though one or two features of the proposals are strongly opposed by landowners) and it is my hope thatthis legislation will provide the foundation upon which the industry can safelybuild for many years to come.2. Owing to the scope of the measure the Bill is necessarily long and com-plicated. In view, however, of the great pressure on Parliamentary time in thecoming session, I have satisfied myself that the Bill only covers those proposalswhich in my view are essential to the promotion of our agricultural policy.Moreover, at the request of the Lord President the Bill has been &quot;&apos;&apos; streamlined &quot;to the greatest possible extent.3. The twin pillars upon which our agricultural policy Tests are stability and efficiency. The main method of providing stability is through guaranteed prices and assured markets which are dealt with in Part I, which applies tothe United Kingdom. These provisions are designedly and necessaxily drawn in very general terms. We have still to settle our long-term plans for the marketing of agricultural commodities, e.g., the extent to which war-time systems of State purchase should be continued. Nor can we yet dispense with the price and other con&apos; rr&apos;s ass sciated with the rationing of food. In any event, however,Elexibili y &apos;:s ) : !       f the modifications and adjustments which arelikely to I conditions change both at homeand abroad. They proviue, juovvevcu, the nect ary machinery to enable the Agri-cultural Ministers to carry out periodical reviews of the industry, to fix prices to enable farmers to plan well ahead, and in conjunction with the Minister ofFood to promote measures to provide assured markets for the main agricultural commodities. In addition powers are taken (Part V, Clauses 74 to 78) to obtainthe necessary statistical information to enable the Government to plan homeagricultural production as an essential part of the Nation&apos;s economy.     - ;4. As a corollary to the provision of this stability, power is being taken toexercise the necessary control measures so as to ensure that all the agricultural land in this country is managed and farmed efficiently. This is mainly dealtwith in Part II of the Bill which lays down general standards of good estate management and good husbandry, and, where landowners and farmers are notcomplying with those standards, enables the Minister to issue directions to them,to place them under supervision, and, if necessary, to dispossess them. Inaddition, wide powers are being taken to acquire agricultural land compulsorilyin cases where it can only be fully and efficiently used under State ownership;to carry out experimental schemes for the readjustment of farm boundaries; andto prevent the splitting up of farm units and land speculation (Part V, Clauses79 to 87).5.   A further corollary of the policy is the essential need to provide for asatisfactory relationship between landlord and tenant.   This is dealt with in[32770] b
Part III of the Bill which carries out substantial amendments to the agricultural holdings Act, 1923, and introduces a number of important new provisions, inparticular that relating to security of tenure for the tenant farmer.6. For the administration of this policy the Bill provides for the settingup on a permanent basis of County Agricultural Executive Committees appointedby the Minister but including a number of members drawn from panels nominated by the farmers, agricultural workers and landowners (Part V, Clauses 68 and 69).Independent Agricultural Land Tribunals are to be set up to hear appeals on themore important issues arising under the Bill, for instance, dispossession of owners and farmers and the operation of notices to quit (Part V, Clauses 70 and 71).The Bill also provides for the setting up of an Agricultural Land Commissionto manage agricultural land acquired by the Minister (Part V, Clauses 65 to 67).7. The other main part of the Bill is Part IV which gives effect to the government&apos;s new smallholdings policy. If agriculture is to be prosperous and efficient men must be attracted to the land. To achieve this three things are essential. First, a satisfactory wage policy, which is being dealt with by theAgricultural Wages (Regulation) Bill now before the House; second, satisfactoryliving conditions such as rural housing, electricity and water supply, for whichthe necessary legislative powers already exist; third, the provision of a satis-factory career on the land, which the present smallholdings policy is designedto promote. The basic feature of the smallholdings policy is the provision ofsmallholdings as a ladder by which experienced and otherwise suitable agricul-tural workers can rise from the ranks and become tenant farmers on their own account. Unlike past smallholdings policy, which was mainly based on socialconsiderations, the present policy is an integral part of our agricultural proposals.8. I attach herewith for information a memorandum explaining theprovisions of the different parts of the Bill in more detail, but I would like todraw the attention of my colleagues to a number of points of special importance(i) Clause 4 confers very wide powers on the Agricultural Ministers and theMinister of Food. It enables them to modify or override any existingAct by Ministerial Order where that is necessary to give effect to theprices fixed after the annual reviews of the economic condition and prospects of the farming industry, or after any special reviews.There are, however, three important safeguards, viz. : (a) Any such Order needs an affirmative resolution of both Houses(cf. Clause 7 (i) (a)).(b) Under subsection (2) any Orders made by virtue of this clausewill cease to have effect after mid-summer 1950 (assuming theBill becomes law in July next), unless continued by a furtherOrder requiring an affirmative resolution of both Houses.(c) An Order can only be made after consultation with representativesof producers.These provisions are likely to be criticised in Parliament as being an extreme example of delegated legislation, but I am satisfied that theyare essential pending further long-term legislation which must await the working out of detailed plans for securing the efficient marketing of the various agricultural products to which this Part of the Billapplies or may apply in the future.(ii) Clause SO provides for security of tenure for the tenant farmer by requiring the Minister&apos;s consent to the operation of a notice to quit.Consent must not be given unless the Minister is satisfied that thechange of occupation will result in the more efficient use of the land.One exception is made to this, namely, that if owners have acquiredan interest in land before 25tih March, 1947, the Minister may give his consent to a notice to quit if he is satisfied that the owner wishes to farm the land himself or through a child or grandchild. Theseproposals are welcomed by the farmers but strongly disliked by thelandowners.(iii) Clause  68 provides for the constitution of  County AgriculturalExecutive Committees. The constitution of the present Committeesincludes a nominated element of three farmers, two workers, and twolandowners. Strong representations have been made to me by theWorkers&apos; Unions and by Government supporters in the House thatin the permanent Committees, the number of farmers&apos; nominations
should be reduced to two to correspond with those of the workers. Itis, however, the interests of farmers and landowners which arepredominantly affected by the work of the Committees, the effect uponworkers&apos; interests being only minor and indirect, and I am satisfiedthat unless the farmers&apos; special interests are recognised in the constitu-tion of the Committees I cannot rely upon their goodwill which isessential to the effective working of the system of administrationthrough County and District Committees. Despite the strong opposition that may be expected I therefore see no alternative butto continue the present constitution of the Committees in thepermanent organisation.(iv) Clause 71 deals generally with references to the Agricultural LandTribunals. Provision is made that where a case is referred to theTribunal its decision should be final.(v) Clause 83 provides for the control of the splitting up of farms intouneconomic units. The consent of the Minister is required to thesale of part of a farm and, if that consent is not obtained, the minister has compulsory purchase powers to buy the different parts of theoriginal farm in order to re-unite the separated portions. This isa complicated clause but in my view necessary to prevent the splittingup of efficient farm units,(vi) Clause 84 provides for experimental schemes for the adjustment of farm boundaries. Many farms, owing to the scattered nature oftheir constituent parts, are uneconomic and it would greatly promoteagricultural efficiency if the units could be rearranged. It is, however,a very difficult problem and for this reason the Bill provides in thefirst instance for only three experimental schemes but with the powerto extend the number by order.- (vii) Clause 86. confers on the Minister power to sell land which has been acquired. I have considered whether it would be possible to limitthis power but have come to the conclusion that it would be impracticable so to do in the Bill. The power will be needed whereagricultural land in the Minister&apos;s ownership is wanted for essentialhousing or factories or roads, or where it would be in the interests ofagricultural efficiency to sell a small portion to a private owner inorder to make his farm a better economic unit. It would not bepossible to detail all the circumstances in which the power may berequired, but I am proposing to make a statement during the passageof the Bill through the House explaining that the power to sell will only be used in the sort of exceptional circumstances which I have mentioned.(viii) Clause 91 provides that where it is necessary for the purposes of thenational food supply the Minister may lay an order before the Houseenabling him to serve special cropping directions on every farmer inthe country and not only on those under supervision. This power maywell be needed in times of an acute world food shortage, such as thepresent, or where it is essential in the interests of the national food supply to obtain the maximum home production of a certain crop.Normally, however, it is contemplated that home food production willbe steered in the directions required by means of price incentives,advice and persuasion. The farmers are prepared to accept thisexceptional power of issuing directions to all farmers, but they are pressing strongly that the orders should be subject to affirmative resolution of the House instead of negative resolution as at present provided by the Bill.9. Subject to the guidance of my colleagues on the special points mentionedin the preceding paragraph and to the submission of the Bill to the legislation committee, I ask authority to proceed with the introduction of the Bill. It isintended that it should be introduced before the Christmas recess and I proposeto issue at the same time an explanatory White Paper.T. W.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, S.W. 1,.27th November, 1946.[32770]
APPENDIXAGRICULTURAL BILLExplanation of Main ProvisionsPart I. Guaranteed Prices and Assured MarketsThis part, which applies to the United Kingdom, deals with the necessary machinery to enable the Agricultural Ministers to provide guaranteed prices andassured markets to the industry.Clause 1, which is largely declaratory, provides for the promotion andmaintenance of a stable and efficient agricultural industry through the provisionof guaranteed prices and assured markets for growers and producers. Clause 2provides for annual reviews of the general economic condition of the agricultural industry as a basis for the fixing of prices, and also provides for special reviewsbetween the annual reviews where there has been a substantial change in theeconomic position of the industry. This is a continuation of the present systemof February reviews, together with special reviews where the necessity arises.Clauses 3 and 4 confer power upon the Ministers, and in appropriate cases theMinister of Food, to make orders either varying any existing measures for theprovision of guaranteed prices and assured markets where those measures are considered to be unsatisfactory, or, where there are no existing measures, toprovide such measures as appear to be necessary. Clause 5 provides for the fixing of prices well in advance so as to enable farmers to plan ahead, and also dealswith the fixing of minimum prices and minimum quantities to which those pricesrelate for live-stock and live-stock products for. from two to four years in advance.These measures relate to the main agricultural commodities set out in the first schedule, but there is power under Clause 6 to add to those commodities.Part II. Good Estate Management and Good HusbandryThis part deals with the necessary control measures to ensure that all owners of agricultural land attain a reasonable standard of good estate management andthat all farmers attain a reasonable standard of good husbandry. Clause 9 lays down that it is the duty of an owner of agricultural land or a farmer to complywith the rules of good estate management and good husbandry which are set outin general terms in Clauses 10 and 11.Clause 12 provides that where an owner or occupier of agricultural land isnot complying with his responsibilities under the rules of good estate managementor the rules of good husbandry respectively, the Minister shall have power toplace him under supervision. In order to prevent the evasion of supervisionorders, Clause 13 provides that where there is a change of owner or occupier ofagricultural land under supervision without the approval of the Minister, the supervision order will continue. Where an owner or occupier has been placed under supervision Clause 14 provides that the Minister may serve on him anydirections necessary to make him fulfil his responsibility to manage or farm theland in accordance with the rules of good estate management or good husbandry.In the case of an owner directions may cover such matters as the provision andmaintenance and repair of fixed equipment or, in suitable cases such as an entailedestate, the appointment of a competent manager. In the case of an occupier,directions may cover any aspect of his farming as, for instance, the cultivation of the land, the management of his live-stock, the application of fertilisers, &amp;c.This Clause also provides that directions relating to the provision, maintenance and repair of fixed equipment may be served on all owners and occupiersnotwithstanding that they are not under supervision. The reason for this isthat it would be absurd to have to place a man under supervision in order to beable to serve a direction on him to remedy one specific matter. No appeals are provided against supervision orders or (subject to the exception mentioned later)against directions, though the persons concerned will be given an opportunity of appearing before the County Agricultural Executive Committee and making representations. In the case of directions on owners for the provision of fixedequipment, however, Clause 15 provides for an appeal to the Agricultural Land
Tribunal, where the estimated reasonable cost of the work is greater than theannual value of the land. The reason for this concession is that the provisionof fixed equipment is likely to be one of the most expensive matters which canbe required by a direction.Where an owner or occupier has been placed under supervision and fails,after twelve months, to show satisfactory improvement in his standard of manage-,ment or husbandry, the Minister is given powers under Clauses 16 and 17 todispossess him. In the case of an owner, dispossession will be by means of the compulsory purchase of his land, while in the case of the occupier it will be bymeans of termination of his tenancy. In both cases provision is made for anappeal to the Agricultural Land Tribunal. Finally, &quot;Clause 18 provides that where satisfactory arrangements cannot be made for the farming of the landafter an occupier has been dispossessed, the Minister may take possession of theland and either farm it himself or let it to a satisfactory tenant. The minister will remain in possession until the owner can satisfy him that satisfactory alternative arrangements have been made.Part III Agricultural HoldingsThis part of the Bill deals with the general relationship of landlord and tenant so as to bring the law into line with the new policy and to enable boththe landlord and the tenant to fulfil their responsibilities under the rules of goodestate management and good husbandry. This part has to be read in conjunctionwith the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1923.Clauses 21 to 28 lay down a comprehensive code of compensation from a land-lord to a tenant for improvements carried out by him during the period of histenancy and for compensation from a tenant to a landlord for any deterioration of the holding during the period of the tenancy. A comprehensive compensationcode of this kind is essential if landlords and tenants are to be encouraged to fulfil their responsibilities for good estate management and good husbandry.The items for which a tenant has a statutory right to claim compensation(Clause 21) are set out in the Third and Fourth Schedules. They can be dividedbroadly into three classes.(a) Long-Term Improvements. Where a tenant has carried out one of these improvements (Third Schedule), which include such matters as theerection of buildings, the provision of water or electricity supplysystems, he has, on quitting the holding, a claim to compensation on thebasis of the increased value of the holding attributable to the improve-ment. This claim is, however, dependent upon his having obtained the prior consent of his landlord to the improvement. Where, however,the landlord unreasonably refuses his consent in the case of an improve-ment included in Part II of the Third Schedule, the tenant can appealto the Minister who can give his consent on such conditions as he thinksreasonable and the Minister&apos;s consent will then entitle the tenant to compensation. The improvements in Part I of the Third Schedule,which are those likely to make a major change in the character of the holding, are, however, entirely subject to the landlords consent.(b) Medium-Term  Improvements. Where a  tenant has  carried out  a medium-term improvement (Fourth Schedule, Part I), which includes such things as the liming of land or mole drainage, he is entitled to claim compensation on quitting on the basis of the valueof the improvement to an incoming tenant (Clause 24).(c) Tenant Right Matters. Where a tenant quits a holding and in conse-quence will not obtain the benefit of such matters as, for instance, hiscultivations of the land, growing crops, or pasture which he has laiddown, the Bill confers upon him (Clause 24) a statutory right to compensation from his landlord based on the unexpired value of thesematters to an incoming tenant. Hitherto a tenant has had to rely forsuch compensation either on custom or on a contract of tenancy, whichhas not been satisfactory. The Bill now provides for the abolition ofthese customary rights (Clause 26).In addition, where a tenant has adopted a special system of farming, forinstance, the ley-farming system, which has been more beneficial to the holdingthan the system which would have been adopted by a normal farmer he can claimcompensation for the increased value of the holding (Clause 27).
Finally, Clause 28 confers for the first time on a landlord a statutory right toolaim compensation from an outgoing tenant for any damage or deterioration1caused to the holding through the tenant failing to comply with his responsibilities&apos;to farm in accordance with the rules of good husbandry.Clauses 32 and 33 provide that, subject to one or two exceptions, a landlord and tenant shall not have power to contract out of these compensation provisions,and they also deal with the transitional arrangements in relation to sitting tenantsat the time of the coming into operation of the Act.In addition Clause 39 enables a tenant who cannot recover his compensation from an impecunious landlord to obtain a charge on the land in respect of thecompensation.Clauses 29 and 30 make provision for security of tenure for a tenant farmerand deal also with the compensation for disturbance which a tenant shall receive from the landlord when he quits the holding as a result of a valid notice to quit.It is provided that where a notice to quit is given to a tenant he shall be entitledto object to the notice, which shall thereupon not become valid until the landlordhas obtained the Ministers consent. The test to be applied by the Minister in deciding whether or not to give his consent is whether the change of occupationis likely to result in the more efficient use of the holding for agricultural purposes.This is subject to one exception, namely, that where an owner has acquired an interest in land before the 25th March, 1947, and satisfies the Minister that he wishes to farm the land himself or through his child or grandchild, the minister may give consent notwithstanding that the landlord does not show that thechange of occupation will result in increased efficiency. Provision is made foran appeal from the Minister&apos;s decision to the Agricultural Land Tribunal. TheMinister&apos;s consent to a notice to quit is not required where the tenant has brokena condition of his contract of tenancy which is not or cannot be remedied; where he is bankrupt; where the land is wanted for a non-agricultural purpose and planning permission has been obtained; or where the tenant has died three months before the giving of the notice to quit. In any case where a valid notice to quitoperates and the tenant quits the holding in consequence, he is entitled to compensation for disturbance from his landlord amounting to a minimum ofone year&apos;s rent and subject to a maximum of two years&apos; rent. Compensation isnot payable in the exceptional cases set out in Clause 29, in particular where a landlord has obtained from the Minister a certificate of bad husbandry. Inaddition, in order to avoid a landlord serving a valid notice to quit with aview to selling the holding with vacant possession, Clause 31 providesthat where a contract of sale is made during the currency of a valid notice toquit the notice shall be void unless the tenant agrees that it shall be valid. these provisions again are an essential part of agricultural policy by providing securityof tenure to tenant farmers and thus enabling them to plan ahead their agricultural operations.Clause 34 enables either the landlord or the tenant to get the rent of a holdingvaried by arbitration. The purpose of this is to ensure that rents of agricultural holdings are adjusted in accordance with the economic circumstances of the industry.In addition, the Clause enables a landlord to obtain an increased rent from histenant where he has carried out an improvement which has increased the valueof the holding. Clause 35 enables the Minister to vary the terms of a tenancyagreement scheduling certain of the land as permanent pasture where he is satisfied that the tenant ought to be enabled to plough up the permanent pasturein order that the holding may be farmed in accordance with the rules of goodhusbandry. Clause 36 empowers the Minister to make by regulations a modelclause dealing with the obligations of landlord and tenant in respect of themaintenance and repair of the fixed equipment of a holding. This model clausewill be read into all tenancy agreements except in so far as there is a writtentenancy agreement placing the liability for maintenance and repair in respectof any item of fixed equipment specifically on the landlord or tenant. The purposeof this provision is to fix the liability for all items of fixed equipment on the holding either on the landlord or the tenant and so enable the parties and theMinister to know clearly where the liability lies and on whom a direction for maintenance and repair of fixed equipment should be served. Clause 37 providesthat where there is no written contract of tenancy either landlord or tenantcan get the verbal agreement reduced to a written contract of tenancy by arbi-tration. The purpose of this is to avoid the present uncertainties relating tothe respective positions of either party under verbal agreements, which are atpresent far too numerous in the agricultural industry.
Clause 38 gives the Minister control over tenancies granted for an interestof less than an annual tenancy which would take them out of the provisions ofthe Agricultural Holdings Act, 1923, and this part of the Bill. It lays down that where a tenancy for 364 days or less is given without the Ministers consentit shall be deemed to be an annual tenancy and thereby brought within theprovisions of this Bill and the 1923 Act dealing with the relationship of land-lord to tenant. The remaining clauses in this part give the landlord powerto enter on the holding for the purpose of carrying out his responsibilities underthe rules of good estate management (Clause 41); enable limited owners to applycapital moneys for carrying out improvements (Clause 40), and lay down thatall matters arising out of the termination of a tenancy shall be dealt with, by arbitration and provide for the period within which that arbitration must takeplace (Clause 42).Part IV. SmallholdingsThis part of the Bill implements the new smallholdings policy which is designed to provide a ladder for agricultural workers to rise to the ranks of tenantfarmer. The administration of smallholdings will continue to be carried out by county Councils and County Borough Councils who will have a duty to providesmallholdings having regard to the demand from suitable persons and the general interest of agriculture (Clause 45). They will have to obtain the ministers approval before they acquire land for smallholdings in order to make sure thatit is suitable land (Clause 46), and the Ministers approval will also be requiredto the equipment and lay-out of new smallholdings, and the alteration of the lay-out and equipment of existing smallholdings (Clause 48). It is an essential feature of the policy that holdings should be such that they are likely to providea reasonable livelihood for the tenant and his family.Smallholdings authorities are empowered to carry out co-operative schemesfor the benefit of their smallholdings (Clause 49), and they are required to letsmallholdings to people with adequate previous agricultural experience and togive preference, other things being equal, to agricultural workers (Clause 50). Inorder to make sure that promising and young agricultural workers are notdebarred from taking smallholdings owing to inadequate working capital, theMinister is empowered to make loans for this purpose (Clause 52).&apos; Apart fromthe Ministers general control and power to give directions to smallholdingsauthorities so as to see that they carry out their duties satisfactorily, Clause 55confers default powers on the Minister so as to enable him to take over any or all of the functions of a smallholdings authority when they are not performingthese satisfactorily. In addition, Clause 54 empowers the Minister to acquire and for smallholdings purposes himself, the intention being that land should be acquired for the carrying out of experiments in smallholdings and in farmingorganisation. These experiments will be carried out by the Land SettlementAssociation and the Welsh Land Settlement Society, acting as agents on behalfof the Minister. It is proposed that the Minister should take over the existingsmallholdings estates of these two bodies in return for remitting their presentdebt to the Government, and that they should in future run these estates as agents for the Minister (Clause 79 (2)).Clauses 56 to 58 enable the Minister to make contributions up to 75 per cent,of the loss incurred by County Councils and County Borough Councils in providing smallholdings, these provisions being similar to those under previoussmallholdings legislation.The remaining Clauses of this part of the Bill provide for the constitutionof Smallholdings Committees by Local Authorities (Clause 59), and in additionlay down that in future smallholdings should not be sold to their tenants butonly let (Clause 62).Part V.-Administrative, and GeneralThis part of the Bill deals with the setting up of the administrative organisa-tion for carrying out the general policy; for the collection of agriculturalstatistics for the planning of the agricultural industry; for general powers of acquisition and management of agricultural land by the Minister; for the serviceof special directions to all farmers in an emergency; for the continuation of grants for drainage, water supply and lime; and for the control of pests and weeds.Clauses 65 to 67 provide for the setting up of an Agricultural Land Com^mission and a Welsh Sub-Commission to manage land vested in the Minister and
placed by him at their disposal, and also to act in an advisory capacity on certain matters. The Commission will be a small non-representative body consisting offive members.Clause 68 provides for the constitution of County Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees which will consist of a maximum of twelve members, five appointeddirect by the Minister and seven appointed from panels nominated by the interests concerned, three being farmers, two workers and two landowners. One of theMinisters direct appointments will be made after consultation with the CountyCouncil. The Committees will act as the Minister&apos;s agents and the intention is that the general administration of the policy should be carried out by these bodies acting under the general directions of the Minister. The necessary power for the Minister to delegate his functions is provided in Clause 69,Clauses 70 and 71 deal with the constitution of Agricultural Land Tribunalswhich will consist of an independent legal chairman appointed by the LordChancellor, together with a farmer and a landowner appointed by the minister from panels nominated respectively by the farmers and the landowners. Inaddition provision is made for the appointment of two assessors who it is contem-plated will normally be independent land agents. The main matters to bereferred to the Tribunal under the Bill are questions of dispossession of owners and occupiers on the grounds of bad estate management or bad husbandry;directions on owners for the provision of fixed equipment; purchase of requisi-tioned land; consents to notices to quit; and certificates of bad husbandry. Thedecision of the Tribunal will in all cases be final.Clause 73 provides for the abolition of County Council Agricultural Com-mittees, which will no longer be needed, and the Councils of Agriculture for england and for Wales.Clauses 74 to 78 confer upon the Minister powers to obtain agriculturalstatistics from farmers and landowners of agricultural land. The existing peace-time Act, the Agricultural Returns Act of 1925, is inadequate and out-of-date.The powers are wide but their exercise is dependent on regulations to be laidbefore Parliament and subject to negative resolution. Provision is made forthe setting up of an Agricultural Statistics Advisory Committee, representativeof all sides of the industry, to advise the Minister. This information togetherwith other information to be collected under the Statistics of Trade Bill willbe needed not only for the purposes of the general reviews under Part I providingfor guaranteed prices and assured markets but also in connection with thegeneral planning of the industry, and the Governments periodical economicsurveys.Clauses 79 to 90 confer wide powers of acquisition and management ofagricultural land on the Minister. He is empowered to acquire land wantedfor agricultural research, experiment or demonstration (Clause 80). Clause 81gives power to acquire land where the Minister is satisfied that full and efficient use cannot be made of it for agricultural purposes without the provision of equipment or the carrying out of works which could only reasonably be expectedto be undertaken by the State. There are wide areas of agricultural land inthis country as, for instance, in the Fen District and in Romney Marsh, whichcould only be dealt with in this way. In addition, power is given by this clauseto acquire land where farms have been severed, for instance by roads and rail-ways, and should be rearranged in order to provide economic units. under clause 82 the Minister is given power to purchase land which has been requisi-tioned during the war and to retain land which has been brought under the agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1941, notwithstanding the obliga-tion imposed under that Act to offer it back to its original owner. This isnecessary in order to ensure that the benefit of work carried out by the Stateduring the war is not lost by the return of the land to private ownership. Inthis case, however, on the analogy of the Requisitioned Land and War WorksAct, 1945, an appeal is provided to the Agricultural Land Tribunal. Clause 83confers on the Minister power to control the splitting up of economic farm unitsby the sale of parts of the units. Where such a sale takes place without theMinister&apos;s consent he is given power to buy compulsorily the component partsof the original unit in order to put it together again. The splitting up of farm units in this way has been proceeding partly as a result of land specula-tion and partly through ex-serviceinen and others buying plots of land in the countryside for alleged smallholdings, but which are in fact quite unsuitable for that purpose. Clause 84 provides for the Agricultural Land Commission tocarry out experimental schemes in the adjustment of farm boundaries. Manyof the farms in this country consist either of scattered fields or are quite
uneconomic owing to their shape and size. The readjustment of these units is bound to give rise to very considerable difficulty, but, nevertheless, it is feltdesirable that an attempt should be made to see whether adjustments can becarried out which will render them more efficient. The other clauses confer on the Minister powers of management and farming and also enable agricultural land vested in other Government Departments to be transferred to the Ministryof Agriculture.Clause 91 empowers the Minister to lay an order before Parliament con-ferring on himself the power to serve directions on all farmers, whether undersupervision or not, in order to obtain the crops needed for the national food supply. It is contemplated that this power will only be used in the event ofan emergency or at a time of world-wide food shortage such as the present.Clauses 92 and 93 provide for the continuation of grants for drainage, water-supply and liming for a limited period of not more than seven years.Clauses 94 to 99 confer upon the Minister powers to control pests andinjurious weeds through the service of directions and through the provision of equipment and services. In particular, Clause 97 provides that the Minister may.authorise the use of spring traps for the killing of rabbits notwithstanding theprohibition contained in the Prevention of Damage by Rabbits Act, 1939. Thisis a controversial question but the use of spring traps provides much the most effective method of extermination of rabbits in inaccessible places such as cliffs.In addition, Clause 100 gives the Minister power to provide agricultural goods and services, the chief intention being that Committees should continue to make available contract services, such as machinery pools and labour gangs for thebenefit, in particular, of the smaller farmers.The remaining clauses of the Bill deal with a number of other supplementarymatters common to all Bills of this kind.[32770]c
