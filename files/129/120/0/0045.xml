annex draft WHITE PAPERRENTS AND SECURITY OF TENURE:  THE RENT bill.       In The Queen&apos;s Speech at the Opening of Parliament, theGovernment promised legislation to restore control of rents.    Thepurpose of this White Paper is to summarise the considerations theGovernment have had in mind in preparing the Rent Bill which has now had its First Reading in the House of Commons.2.       The Bill has two objects - first to restore the security of tenureundermined by the Rent Act of 1957; and second to lay the foundation for a better relationship between the landlord and the tenant of rentedproperty, by introducing a new and flexible system of rent regulation.BACKGROUND3.       Ever since World War I, a long series of measures of rent restriction has been forced upon successive Governments.    The causehas always been the same - the chronic shortage of rented housing.Although there have been plenty of the more expensive sorts of houses and, more recently, of new luxury flats - so that rents at this levelcould be left to be fixed by the laws of supply and demand - the situation at the other end of the social scale has been very different.    Here notonly has there been no freedom of  choice, but basic security of tenurehas been threatened by an acute  shortage of houses to rent within themeans of those who need them.    The two groups which have sufferedworst have been lower paid workers with families and retired persons on small fixed incomes.4.       In the inter-war years - despite the housing boom of the 1930s -the amount of new rented accommodation either privately or publiclybuilt was not sufficient to overcome this scarcity;  and the rent controls which v/ere first designed as a wartime expedient never completelydisappeared.    During World War II the shortage of rented houses wasintensified not merely by the interruption of normal building but by theadditional factor of widespread air-raid damage.    Full scale rent control was reirnposed on the outbreak of war; and continued in thepost war years along with other forms of rationing, as the only meansof preventing exploration of an essential commodity in short supply.-1-

5.       In the 1950s, the supply of houses in England and Wales began toincrease fast as the drive for owner -occupation got under way.    By 1957,the comparison of the number of houses available with the number of households requiring separate homes suggested the comfortableconclusion that the housing shortage was well nigh overcome.6.       But for the purpose of measuring the freedom of choice open tothe householder of moderate means, or the family man moving to a newjob and in search of a house to rent, national figures have little relevance.What matters is whether the accommodation he needs is available within reasonable reach of the place where he works, and whether the rent is within his means.    The ever increasing growth of employment in the cities, and the failure to match it with corresponding provision ofhouses, have between them concentrated the acute demand in and around &apos;half a dozen large conurbations.    In these areas the shortage ofmoderately priced rented accommodation has become an endemic socialcrisis.7.       In these conurbations - and particularly in London - all the achievements in house-building since the war have scarcely eased thisdesperate scarcity.    Although the 1961 census showed that in Englandand Wales there were already 60, 000 and in Scotland 18, 000 more homesthan households it also showed that the number of houses of all kinds inLondon was sufficient only for 95. 7 per cent of households.    Thecorresponding percentages for Birmingham were 93. 6, for Liverpool94. 1, for Manchester 96. 4 and for Glasgow 98. 3.     These percentagesdo not give a complete picture since they do not reveal the state of thehousing stock nor the full pressure of demand for better housing; andit is the pressure of total demand which drives rents up and exacerbatesrelations between landlords and tenants.8.       The growth of owner-occupations has not eased the situation;in some ways it has made it worse - notably be encouraging landlordsto sell off rented property at inflated prices and reducing the alreadydwindling pool of rented houses.    Indeed a striking feature of the last14 years is that the growth in owner-occupation has not been accompanied by any growth in privately rented housing;  on the contrarythis has steadily shrunk.-2-

Ca 0 f^S F i D E  ^3 Y i i^. LDecontrol under the 1957 Act9.     It is only against this background that the consequences of the rent Act of 1957 can be appreciated.    The then Government held thatbloc de-control of rented accommodation, carried out by stages, would help to end the housing shortage by discouraging under-occupation andthat ultimately rents would settle down.    It was also expected that de-control would give landlords an incentive to relet instead of selling andwould enable them to maintain their properties in good repair.10.     It was with these expectations that the Rent Act was passed.But the first phase of block de-control - which altered the limits of rent control from   100 rateable value in London,  90 in Scotland and 75 elsewhere to  40,  40 and  30 respectively - made it clear that under scarcity conditions a return to the free market was not providing the much heralded benefits to the tenant.    In view of the widespreadalarm, block de-control was taken no further.    Creeping de-control,however - under which control ceases when a tenancy comes to an end,e. g. through the departure or death of the tenant - was allowed tocontinue.11.     It is now possible to make an objective judgment on the effects of de-controL    /already in I960, the report of an inquiry into theworking of the Rent Act showed that optimistic expectations were beingdisappointed.    In the great conurbations, the scarcity of cheap rentedproperty grew worse and the density of occupation changed little;indeed there was an actual . increase in under-occupation.    Moreover,one unpredicted effect of the Rent Act - which was accentuated by a vigorous slum clearance programme - was the increase in the rate atwhich the pool of privately rented dwellings was declining.    Whereasimmediately prior to the 195 7 Act they numbered something over  million, this number had sunk by mid-1964 to an estimated3-g- million.    Finally there was no evidence that de-control hadencouraged landlords to improve their properties and not much sign of increase in the rate of repairs.Report of the Milner Holland Committee12.     It is probably true - as the authors of the Rent Act assumed -that when rents are controlled landlords are likely to prefer selling toreletting; i. e. that de-control did something to encourage reletting.But it is also true that in conditions of scarcity rents can easily be-3-

forced up to intolerable levels.    Complaints of exploitation, harassmentand actual hornelessness caused by de-control led the previous government to appoint an independent Committee under the chairmanship of Sir Milner Holland, C. B. E, , Q, C. , to make a survey of rented accommodation and of the relations between private landlords andtenants in Greater London.13.     The CommitteeTs Report (Housing in Greater London, Cmnd. 2605)was published on 11th March.    The Committee were not asked to makeformal recommendations, but their report, which is largely based onsurveys specially carried out for them, contains a thorough examina-tion of housing and social conditions in Greater London, and makes anumber of stimulating suggestions about possible improvements.    TheCommittee comment particularly on several aspects of post-war housing policy as applied to Greater London - for example, the need to encouragehousing societies to produce houses at cost-rents; the working of theprovisions in the Housing Act 1964 on houses in multiple occupation(which includes houses let in lodgings); policy on improvement grants;the allocation of council houses and housing subsidy policy.    Most ofthese matters are already under review.    The Government are nowexamining the report in detail and it will be of the greatest value tothem in preparing the further action, additional to the Rent Bill, whichwill certainly be necessary.14.     The report fully confirms the Governments view that in theconditions of shortage found in Greater London and in the other maincentres of population - though information about conditions outsideGreater London is less specific - legislation is urgently required to restore security of tenure and to regulate rents.THE RENT 3ILLSecurity of tenure15.     The Rent Bill is designed to repair the damage caused by thede-control provisions of the Rent Act, 1957 and to give to every tenanta reasonable security of tenure: full security where shown &quot;tage makesthat necessciry, and protection against arbitrary eviction for all.The Government see this as one of the basic rights of every humanbeing.-4-

16.     Full security, accompanied by rent regulation, will apply toall rented properties (except those referred to in the next paragraph) ofrateable value up to  400 in London and  200 elsewhere.    This shouldrestore control over substantially the field which was covered before1957.    It may be that in some parts of the country there is now no realscarcity and the Bill enables the Government to release areas from control when they are satisfied that this is no longer necessary.    Butin the absence of adequate information about the position of tenants theGovernment believe it right to apply full security and rent regulationeverywhere at the outset; relaxing this only when experience shows thatit is safe to do so.Basic protection for those not covered by rent regulation17.     The provision for full security and rent regulation will notapply universally.    It will not for example apply to tenants of properties outside the rateable value limits defined in the Bill or to tenants in various forms of publicly-owned property.    Further, as explained, control may be lifted from some areas as this provespossible.    It is still necessary to provide some basic protection against eviction which will apply to all tenants; the same protectionis given by the Bill to service licensees.18.     As a temporary measure the Protection from Eviction Act 1964,which was timed to expire at the end of 1965, made it an offence forthe owner of a property within the jurisdiction of the county court -i. e. having a net annual value of  400 or less - to enforce his right topossession without an order from that court.    That Act providedlengthened protection by the simplest means; by extending up to12 months the court  s discretion to grant suspension of orders forpossession.    This, which was intended only to bridge the gap pendingenactment of the Bill now introduced, will be discontinued.    The newBill prohibits eviction without a court order from premises of any value.    This will become a permanent part of the law of landlord and tenant.     / Special provisions are included to deal with the circumstancesof agricultural employees who occupy premises under the terms oftheir employment/.    Tenants of local and other public authorities willbe protected like others against arbitrary eviction; but in view of the considerable increase in work which might be thrown on the county-5-

courts, particularly in some large towns, local authorities will beallowed for the time being to retain their present right to seekpossession through the magistrates  courts.    In Scotland the law alreadyprovides that any landlord, whether a private person or a localauthority, cannot evict a tenant without an order from the Sheriff.A fair rent19.     Full security requires rent regulation.    In drawing up a new scheme for regulating rents the Government have sought to avoid therigidity and anomalies of the old control and have aimed at a methodof rent-fixing which, given security of tenure, will result in rentswhich are fair to both landlord and tenant and will enable rents to be reviewed from time to time.    The definition of a fair   rent where thenormal process of free negotiations is inhibited by scarcity is obviously a difficult matter.    The Government considered relatingrents to the new gross values for rating, but rejected this becausethe gross values do not give an accurate indication of the rent appropriate for particular tenancies and cannot be kept up-to-date.     It would not be satisfactory simply to relate permitted rents to the general level of rents passing in the area since this would perpetuate high rents whichhave been inflated by scarcity.    Accordingly the Government havedecided to rely on a formula designed to enable a fair rent to besettled without regard to the effect of scarcity on existing rent levels.Clause 21 provides that in determining a fair &quot;rent, account is to betaken of all the circumstances, including in particular the age,character and locality of the house, and its state of repair.   Considera-tion of scarcity is to be eliminated by assuming, in the fixing of the rent, that the number of people seeking similar accommodation in thearea is not substantially greater than the amount of such accommodation which is available for letting.Rent Officers20.     The immediate need is to get decontrolled rents reviewed andthose that are exorbitant reduced to fair levels; and to ensure that future lettings are arranged on a fair basis.    The Government are anxious to give landlords and tenants every encouragement to agree a fair rent themselves.    The Bill will strengthen the tenant&apos;snegotiating position by giving him full security of tenure and forbiddingany increase in his existing rent save for specified reasons.    With-6-

landlord and tenant thus placed on something like equal terms it is perhaps not too much to hope that agreement will become the normal practice.    But to help the parties in reaching agreement where they need help, the Government propose, with the assistance of localauthorities in England and Wales, to establish local rent officers whowill be a first point of reference for landlords and tenants who cannotreach agreement unaided.    The function of the rent officer will be tobring the parties together and help them to settle the proper rent forany tenancy in the light of the provisions in the Bill.    Rent officers inScotland will be employed directly by the Secretary of State.    InEngland and V7ales, where the amount of work is bound to be much larger and to need a large number of rent officers to deal with it, theservice will be provided through the councils of counties and county boroughs, and in London on the councils of the London boroughs.    Thecost will be reimbursed by the Exchequer and the responsibility of authorities will be limited to the provision of the service; they willhave no function in determining what constitute fair rents.Rent assessment committees21.     Where the parties are unable to accept the view taken by the rent officer the issue between them will be referred to the rentassessment committee for the area.    These committees, which are tobe appointed by the Minister concerned, will be a form of local renttribunal.    A committee will normally consist of three people, includingas a rule a valuer and a lawyer.    The parties will be able to state their cases, quite informally if they wish (though there will be noobjection to legal representation), and the committee will come to afinal determination of a fair rent for the property, against which therewill be no appeal save on a point of law.Registration of rents22.     Rents which are thus settled - by the parties1 acceptance ofthe rent officer&apos;s findings, or, in the last resort, by the rent assess-ment committee - will be registered; and it is to be expected thatlandlords and tenants who reach agreement unaided will also have theiragreements registered.    A registered rent will not be open to alteration,except on grounds specified in the Bill, for a period of three years from the effective date of registration.    The same machinery will apply to the fixing of rents for newly let premises.-7-

Existing control23.     Rent control in its pre-1957 form is still in operation overnearly Z\ million tenancies, though owing to the creeping de-controlprovisions of the 1957 Act the number of tenants enjoying its protectionhas been steadily diminishing.    For &apos; the future, vacation of a propertypreviously controlled will result not in de-control but in transfer, onre-letting, to the new scheme.    The Bill will, for the time being,maintain for the properties still under the existing control the rentlimits laid down in the 1957 Act.    It enables the Government to apply the new rent regulation machinery to review of old controlled rents;but the first call on the new machinery must be to settle fair rentsfor tenancies not at present under control, and the intention is to bringcontrolled rents under review at different times in different areas asthe machinery becomes free to handle the additional work.Furnished lettings24.     Furnished lettings will continue to be subject to the jurisdiction of the present furnished houses rent tribunals.    On referring to a tribunal, tenants of furnished lettings can already get security for upto three months and the tribunals have power to extend this securityby fresh periods of up to three months.    The maximum period will in both cases be raised to six months: otherwise the present general arrangements will be maintained.    But the Bill provides that when thissecurity expires the tenant should like all other tenants enjoy protection against arbitrary eviction; it would be quite wrong to allow landlordsRENT BILL: DRAFT WHITE PAPERRevised paragraph 25&quot;Harassment25.     The Protection from Eviction Act made it an offence to evict,without a court order, a tenant whose right to go on living in his homehad already expired.    Clause 24 of the Bill makes it an offence tointimidate a tenant who is still legally entitled to occupy his presenthome.    Anyone who interferes with the peace and comfort of a tenantwith the object of persuading him to give up possession or to refrain from exercising his legal rights will be liable on summary convictionto a fine up to  100 (or  500 for a second offence) or six months1imprisonment or both.     The provisions follow closely those in theNew York Police Statute to which attention was drawn in the report ofthe Milner Holland Committee (Cmnd. 2605).&quot;

Existing control23.     Rent control in its pre-1957 form is still in operation overnearly 2^ million tenancies, though owing to the creeping de-controlprovisions of the 1957 Act the number of tenants enjoying its protectionhas been steadily diminishing.    For &apos; the future, vacation of a propertypreviously controlled will result not in de-control but in transfer, onre-letting, to the new scheme.    The Bill v/ill, for the time being,maintain for the properties still under the existing control the rentlimits laid down in the 1957 Act.    It enables the Government to apply the new rent regulation machinery to review of old controlled rents;but the first call on the new machinery must be to settle fair rentsfor tenancies not at present under control, and the intention is to bringcontrolled rents under review at different times in different areas asthe machinery becomes free to handle the additional work.Furnished lettings24,     Furnished lettings will continue to be subject to the jurisdiction of the present furnished houses rent tribunals.    On referring to a tribunal, tenants of furnished lettings can already get security for upto three months and the tribunals have power to extend this securityby fresh periods of up to three months.    The maximum period will in both cases be raised to six months^ otherwise the present general arrangements v/ill be maintained.    But the Bill provides that when thissecurity expires the tenant should like all other tenants enjoy protection against arbitrary eviction; it would be quite wrong to allow landlordswho let furnished premises to be the only ones who could evict their tenants without obtaining a court order.    As mentioned in paragraph 18,a court order is already necessary in Scotland.    The Bill also puts as top to the practice by which landlords  can avoid reference to a tribunal by serving a notice to quit.Harassment25.     Harassment of tenants is made a criminal offence.    anyone who interferes with the peace and comfort of a tenant with the objectof persuading him to give up possession or to refrain from exercisinghis legal rights is to be liable on summary conviction for a fine or imprisonment or both.-8-

0CONCLUSION26.     The Bill will bring immediate relief to tenants who are atpresent suffering from the terror of insecurity, and will enable thosewho are paying excessive rents to get them reduced.    The government believe that it will also lay a lasting foundation for a better relationship between landlord and tenant.    It is not, however, a complete solutionof this relationship, and in their further study of the Milner Hollandreport the Government will particularly examine the question whethermore general aspects of the law of landlord and tenant, which fall outside the ambit of the Bill, should be the subject of further legislation.If Parliament approve proposals which are now before them in theLaw Commissions Bill, the Commission may well be prepared to give priority to an examination of the existing law in England and wales which is badly in need of comprehensive review.27.

Still less is the Bill a solution of the housing shortage.    its main purpose is to give to tenants essential protection until there areenough rented houses.    YtThat is required is an all-out effort greatly to increase rented accommodation, let at moderate rents, in the areas where it is needed.    The Government will set themselves to meet this need for more and better rented housing, which they see as thefirst priority in their housing policy.-9-
