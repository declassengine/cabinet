C.(65) 187th February, 1965COPY NO.  59CABINETGIBRALTARMemorandum by the Foreign secretary. Background to the DisputeGibraltar was discussed for the second year running in theUnited Nations Committee of 24 between 23rd September and16th October, 1964.    These discussions concluded with the adoptionon 16th October of a consensus inviting the United Kingom and Spain&quot;to undertake . , . conversations in order to find ... a negotiatedsolution ...&quot;   On the following day the Spanish authorities imposedrestrictions on transit of the La Linea frontier.2.      These restrictions were lifted on 22nd October.    Her Majesty&apos;governments decision not to participate in the SPANEX exercise wasconveyed to the Spanish Ministry for Foreign Affairs that same evening.The restrictions were reimposed on 31st October.3.      When first imposed the restrictions took the form of rigorouscustoms examination of and consequent delays to vehicles crossing thefrontier and the levying of new duties on goods.    More recently theexport from Spain to Gibraltar of all goods except foodstuffs has been restricted.    The Spanish authorities have refused to recognise the validity of driving licences issued in Gibraltar and a ban has beenplaced on foreign nationals living in the Campo area from using theirpassports to cross the frontier to work in Gibraltar.B. Action Taken to Date4.      During November a.nd December H. M. Ambassador at Madridmade a number of oral representations to the Spanish Ministry ofForeign Affairs v/ith a view to persuading the Spanish Government toremove the restrictions.    These representations proved unavailingand on 11th January, 1965, H. M. Ambassador handed the SpanishMinister of Foreign Affairs a formal Note protesting against therestrictions.    This Note also made the point, with reference to theconsensus of the Committee of 24, that Her Majesty&apos;s Government couldnot regard the question of sovereignty as a matter for negotiation andthat they could not in any case entertain any proposals for conversationsso long as the abnormal situation on the frontier continued.    TheSpanish Government replied to this communication on 16th January with areiteration of the demand they had already made in an earlier Note of18th November for &quot;negotiations&quot; about Gibraltar,5, On 21st January the Spanish representative at the United Nationsquoted the full texts of these three Notes, Her Majesty&apos;s Government^position was re-affirmed in a further Note of 22nd January and the-1-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENT)

7r*0texts of our two Notes have been circulated through the Secretary Generalof the United Nations to all members.    During the last fortnightH. M. Embassy have made further representations about the most recentlyimposed restrictions, but with the same lack of success.C.   Possible Spanish Objectives6.       There is general support in Spain for the viow that Gibraltarshould be returned to her and that the maintenance by one Europeancountry of a colony on what is claimed to be the territory of another isan anachronism in the twentieth century.    The ultimate aim of theSpanish Government is undoubtedly to recover Gibraltar and general franco would certainly regard this as the crowning achievement of hiscareer.    He has, however, hitherto maintained that Gibraltar is not worth a war and although the possibility of an attempted coup de maincannot be exluded, there is little likelihood that Spain would attempt to seize Gibraltar by force.7.      In these circumstances the Spanish Government have evidentlyregarded the discussions in the United Nations Committee of 24 as providing a convenient means for pressing their claims, and their decision to impose restrictions may result from their belief that thepresent is a good moment for attempting to force us to negotiate.8.      At the same time there seems little doubt that the SpanishGovernment were genuinely disturbed by the grant to Gibraltar in April,1964, of a further measure of self-government.    Article X of the Treatyof Utrecht (1713) provided that, if the Crown of Great Britain shouldalienate therefrom the propriety of Gibraltar, &quot;the preference of havingthe same shall always be given to the Crown of Spain before any others.&quot;The Spanish Government argues that the grant of self-government to gibraltar would be tantamount to alienation of our pr op3?ig cy 3.1* d thatthe withdrawal of direct British control over the territory in any caseconstitutes a threat to Spain&apos;s national interests.D. Likely Future Action by Spain9.       The Spanish Ambassador intimated, on 29th January, that hethought that the present difficulties with regard to Gibraltar would be satisfactorily sorted out in due course and it has since been intimatedto H. M. Embassy at Madrid that the Spanish Government might call offthe restrictions if we were to signify our readiness to have discussions about Gibraltar v/ithout pre-conditions.    H. M. Embassy have been instructed to reply that while we cannot regard the question of sovereignty over Gibraltar as a matter for negotiation we have at no timewished to insist on pre-conditions in a way which would preventconversations from starting.    It is too soon to say how the SpanishGovernment may react.     But, for the reasons in paragraph 7 above, itseems most likely that the Spanish Government will continue the present restrictions and may even seek to impose others.E. Courses Open to H. M. G.10.      It has been stated in Parliament that H. M.G. will protect the welfare of Gibraltar and the legitimate interests of its people and v/illtake all necessary measures to that end.    There seems to be no furtherdiplomatic action which we could usefully take.   Further representations to the Spanish Government will clearly be useless and the Americans-2-

have already indicated that they would be unwilling to intervene with theSpanish Government on our behalf.    Any attempt to refer the presentsituation to the United Nations would seem unprofitable.    If the general assembly was functioning normally, it would probably endorse theconsensus already adopted by the Committee of 24.    It is questionable whether reference to the Security Council could be justified.    But such reference would in any case be likely to produce no better result thanthat obtained in the Committee of 24.    In short any reference to theUnited Nations will almost certainly result in a call for negotiations between ourselves and Spain.11.      An examination has been made of counter-measures which H.M.G.might take against Spain in retaliation for the restrictions and a paper setting out the various possibilities in this field is attached.     But theconclusions to be drawn from it seem to be that apart perhaps frommounting a propaganda campaign against Spain, which would have someeffect in deterring British tourists from going there, any reprisals we might take against Spanish interests would be likely to cause equal, if notgreater, damage to our own.    Moreover any economic or other reprisalswhich we might initiate would certainly result in further measures of retaliation against Gibraltar which might lead to the complete sealing ofthe frontier and the denial of all Spanish labour to the Rock.12.      Other objections to a policy of reprisals are that -(a) our exports to Spain have expanded from  23.7 million in 1959to about  74. 2 million in 1964 and it is clearly to the interestof our economy as a whole to maintain our stake in the rapidly expanding Spanish market;(b) there are defence and service interests which would suffer fromany further deterioration of our relations.F.   Conclusion13.     In these circumstances our policy should be to try as far as possibleto treat the question of Gibraltar in isolation.    It would seem best toavoid reprisals which may well damage British interests and increase thedifficulties for Gibraltar and that any measures we may take to protect the welfare of Gibraltar should be of a positive nature, designed to supportits economy.    Such measures should serve to demonstrate to Spain thatwe have no intention of yielding to duress.    At the same time the publicity now being given to the restrictions seems likely to result in some loss of revenue from tourists in southern Spain.    Faced with these factsthe Spaniards may sooner or later conclude that it is in their own interestto lift the restrictions.M, S.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.6th February, 1965

ANNEXMEASURES WHICH MIGHT BE TAKEN AGAINST SPAIN INRETALIATION FOR HSR RESTRICTIONS AGAINST gibraltar and THEIR LIKELY CONSEQUENCESI.   MEASURES WHICH COULD BE taken a.      Non-Attributable MeasuresThere would seem to be three principal possibilities in this field.(a) An intensified press campaign against the restrictions and againstSpain generally(i)  Our information services are already making normal use ofthe information available about the hardships caused by the Spanish restric-tions, the lack of justification for them, etc and there has already been some publicity in the British press on these lines.    It should be possible toincrease the amount of such publicity both here and abroad and to dis&quot;seminate other material which would show Spain in a bad light.    Spain hastaken considerable pains in recent years to improve her &quot;public image&quot; inthe United Kingdom and elsewhere, and the Spanish Government wouldcertainly dislike such adverse publicity.(ii)  The effect of the restrictions on Gibraltar has not so far beenvery newsworthy and publicity about it may not make much of an impact unless;the Spaniards increase the difficulties on the frontier still further.    Butadditional interest in this question could be stimulated by contriving question and statements in Parliament.    Care would have to be taken, in any suchpublicity campaign, to avoid spreading the impression that there is littleHer Majesty&apos;s Government can do about this situation.(b) Action by the Trades Unions(i) A high proportion of Gibraltarian workers belong to the gibraltar branch of the Transport and General IVorkers Union.    It has beensuggested that this branch, which is an active one, might stimulate the parent union, with discreet encouragement from Her Majesty1 s Government,to take measures such as refusing to handle Spain&apos;s produce in british ports.    This would cause inconvenience to Spanish shippers.(ii) But the net effect might damage us more than Spain.   and action of this kind by the Trades Unions could not be fully controlled by her majesty&apos;s Government.    There are various obvious dangers in encouraging the Trades Unions to play this sort of role which if adopted in othersituations might seriously hamper the conduct of foreign affairs.    And thefact referred to at D(d) below, on possible administrative measures to hamper Spanish exports to the United Kingdorrythat most Spanish producealready belongs to British importers when it arrives here is also relevant.(c) A possible &quot;Front&quot; against Spain(i) A committee of eminent private persons might be formed tovoice British indignation at 3pain&apos;s behaviour.    If such a committee wereto be provided with fairly substantial funds, it could wage an un&apos;inhibitedpress campaign (including the use of large advertisements in the national press).    This might worry the Spanish Government much more than the sort of campaign described in (a) above and might well cause a reduction-4-

in the number of British tourists going to Spain.    Moreover such a &quot;Front&quot;could be active in writing letters of protest to international and nationalorganisations as well as to the press.(ii) It might not be too difficult to find suitable people preparedto take part in a manoeuvre of this sort.    But it would not be easy to makethe necessary arrangements quickly, there would be a serious risk of her majesty&apos;s Governments part becoming known and the operations of such a&quot;Front&quot; might prove difficult to control.2.      In general non-attributable measures of these kinds would have theadvantages of making it easier for the Spanish Government to climb downshould they decide that it was in their interests to do so.    Although itwould probably be obvious to them that such measures had to some extentbeen officially inspired, it would be easier from the point of view of prestige to tabs a decision to lift the restrictions in the face of non-attributable reaction than in that of direct governmental reprisals.B.      Action to curtail British Tourish Traffic to SpainMore British tourists go to Spain than to any other foreign country.The number last year was almost one million, about one-eighth of the totalnumber of foreign tourists received by Spain and one-quarter of all british holiday-makers abroad.    Spain benefited from their presence tothe extent of about  30 million in terms of revenue.    There would seem tobe four main measures which might be taken to reduce the flow of Britishtourists to Spain.(a) Public exhortation(i) A campaign of the kind envisaged in A(a) and possibly A(c)above and statements by Ministers indicating that, while theSpanish restrictions on Gibraltar continued, it was against thenational interest for tourists to spend money in Spain should have some effect on the numbers of tourists going there.    This wouldbe more pronounced if there were simultaneously other signs of growing tension betv/een ourselves and Spain, since tourists tendto avoid potential trouble spots.(ii) A deliberate campaign to discourage tourists might however be challenged in the I. M. F. or the O. E. CD. on the grounds that itwas discriminatory.(b) Denunciation of the Anglo-Spanish Visa Abolition Agreement(i)  This Agreement may be denounced in whole or in part by either Government at one month&apos;s notice.    Its denunciationwould certainly have some deterrent effect on would-be visitors to Spain.(ii)  But denunciation of the Agreement would not in itself resultin British subjects visiting Spain having to obtain visas and the spaniards might well decide not to reimpose such a requirement.Moreover such action on our part would run counter to ourestab?dshed and publicised policy of seeking to extend the abolitionof visas and the easing of travel restrictions.    This last pointapplies also td the next two proposals.-5-

?in the number of British tourists going to Spain.    Moreover such a &quot;Front1could be active in writing letters of protest to international and nationalorganisations as well as to the press,(ii)  It might not be too difficult to find suitable people preparedto take part in a manoeuvre of this sort.    But it would not be easy to makethe necessary arrangements quickly, there would be a serious risk of her majesty&apos;s Governments part becoming known and the operations of such a&quot;Front&quot; might prove difficult to control.2.

This last pointapplies also to the next tv/o proposals.-5-

(c) Restriction of Passports(i)  United Kingdom passports carry a printed endorsement&quot;valid in all parts of the Commonwealth and for all foreigncountries&quot;.    In theory, an administrative decision could be takento endorse all new or renewed passports as valid for all countriesexcept Spain.(ii)  But such a decision could not be applied to existing passportsuntil they required renewal and it would in any case be open to theSpanish authorities to continue to admit British tourists even if their passports were endorsed in the manner suggested.    Further-more our agreement with Spain on the use of British Visitorspassports for travel to Spain can only be terminated after sixmonths&apos; notice.(d) Cutting off the Foreign Currency Allowances for Spain(i)  British subjects travelling abroad are at present allowedforeign currency without restriction.    Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentcould decide that this arrangement should no longer be applied forSpain and the Treasury could instruct the Bank of England to implement such a decision.   This would probably be possible without attendant legislation, although there is some doubt aboutthe legality of using the present Exchange Control Act for politicalpurposes.    Exactly how the decision could be implemented would need to be worked out.    Such a measure could be expected to deterlarge numbers of tourists from going to Spain - broadly speakingthe half million who would have otherwise planned to travel theredirect by air or sea.    The half million tourists going to Spain viaFrance could of course obtain Spanish currency there on route.(ii)  But such a measure would be in direct conflict with Article 8of the International Monetary Fund (which stipulate;.-: freedom for current payments) and would also offend in two respects againstthe O. E. C. D. Code of Liberalisation of Current InvisibleOperations, to which both we and the Spanish Government havesubscribed.    We would thus expose ourselves to justifiablecriticism in both the I. M. F. and O. E. C. D.2.      In general a substantial reduction in the number of British touristsvisiting Spain would clearly deal a blow to the Spanish economy.    but apart from the disadvantages set out above any such action would damage the interests of British tourist agents and carriers and might well be seriously resented by a large section of the public.    In particular most ofthose intending to visit Spain this year have probably already made theirbookings.C.      Action to prevent British Property Investment in SpainUnder present regulations, exchange control permission is normally given to a British subject to use investment currency for thepurchase of real estate in Spain (on the basis of one property per person).Far more British subjects buy villas in Spain than in any other country.The Treasury do not have exact figures but believe that expenditure ofthis kind amounts to about  5 million per year.    It would probably bepossible, within the terms of the Exchange Control Act, to put a stop tothis by an instruction from the Treasury to the Bank of England whichwould result in the Bank refusing permission to applicants.

2.      However, as mentioned at B(d) above, there is some doubt aboutthe legality of such an application of the Act.    Such action would in anycase offend against the non-discrimination clause of the O. E. CD.Capital Payments Code, and thus expose us to criticism in the O.E. C. D.D.      Action in the Commercial Field(a)   An all-out Trade War(i) Although trade between Spain and the United Kingdom is roughly in balance at a level of just over  70 million per annum, we areSpainrs most important customer.    We take some 16 per cent of Spain&apos;total exports, whereas she takes only 1.7 per cent of ours.    Thus in anall-out economic war we could, in the short-term, damage the Spanisheconomy more than the Spaniards could damage ours.(ii)  If we wished to start such a war the President of the Boardof Trade could issue an Administrative Instrument amending the open general Licence, so that import licences would be needed for all goodsconsigned from or originating in Spain.    Import licences would then be withheld.    This action would not require legislation.    It would take about one week to put into effect and perhaps three weeks to become fullyoperative, as concessions would have to be made for goods shipped beforethe issue of the Instrument.    It could quickly result in the cutting off ofvirtually all Spanish imports into the United Kingdom.(iii)  Such action would be in contravention of the GATT but it is unlikely that any Spanish complaint on this score would damage usmaterially.    Since however British exports to Spain are rapidly expanding(1959 =  23.7 million, 1961 =  37.9 million, 1964 =  74.2 million), wewould probably stand to lose more in the long run than Spain from actionof this sort.    In any case, such action would have the following results -(a) Spain would lose trade worth about  70 million per annum.But she would be able to sell elsewhere a proportion of thegoods diverted from the United Kingdom and this proportionwould increase annually.    Spain would nonetheless face thepermanent loss, even after a return to normal relationsbetween the two countries, of a proportion of her present tradewith the United Kingdom.(b) Great Britain would lose, as a result of Spanish retaliation,trade now worth about  75 million per annum.     Alternativemarkets could probably not be found.    Moreover the UnitedKingdom would lose her position in the rapidly expanding a,ndhighly competitive Spanish market, and would forfeit theproportion of orders which she is now likely to win under thefirst Spanish Development Flan.(c) There might be some increase in food prices, particularly of fruit, in the United Kingdom.(d) There would be heavy losses to a number of individual Spanishand British firms in the import-export business.

CONFIDENTIAL(b)    Denial to Spain of Licenced United Kingdom Exports(i) Short of an all-out economic war it would be possible, under theExport of Goods Control Order to deny to Spain a wide range of british goods by the refusal of export licences.(ii) Group 1 of the schedule of the Order covers arms and military equipment.    In 1964 licences under this group were issued for goods worthsome  160,000.    Of this total goods worth about  135, 000 were supplied by the aircraft and electronics industries.    For example, replacementengines were supplied for Dakota aircraft in service with civilian operatorsin Spain and for transport aircraft of the Spanish Air Force.    Groups 2 to of the schedule of the Order cover such goods as atomic energy materials,electronic and scientific appliances, minerals and metals, engineering products, chemicals, transport equipment and valuables.(iii) It is however unlikely that any of the goods licenced underGroup 1 were of much importance to Spain or that she would be unable toobtain them from sources outside the United Kingdom.    She could probably also find alternative suppliers of the items licenced under Groups 2 to 9whereas the denial of licences for export under these groups would severelydamage our own export trade to Spain.    Action to deny to Spain licencedUnited Kingdom exports would therefore be likely to damage Britishinterests and would probably have little or no effect on Spain.(c)    Action in the GATT(i) Spain and the United Kingdom are both full contracting partiesto the GATT and Spain1 s action in imposing a special licencing system onthe export of goods from Spain to Gibraltar, and refusing licences foralmost all goods except fresh food-stuffs, appears to be in breach of the gatt.    The refusal of licences for goods for which licences are issued forother destinations is almost certainly contrary to Article XIII on non-discrimination.    The imposition of the new licencing system itself may also be contrary to the obligations of contracting parties under Article XI.(ii) This matter has already been taken up with the SpanishAuthorities by Her Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Madrid.    This action could befollowed up by a formal request for consultations as provided for underArticle XXII of the GATT in view of the threat to Gibraltar trade.    Ifthese consultations were to be refused by Spain, or were to be held andwere to come to nothing, we could, under Article XXIII of the GATT, callon the contracting parties to investigate and make recommendations on thegrounds that Spanish actions nullified the general objectives of the GATT.(iii) But the contracting parties would have no powers to forceSpain to accept any recommendations they might make and the results ofpursuing this matter in the GATT would probably be as follows -(a) The GATT might authorise Gibraltar (but not the United Kingdom)to withdraw any trade concession which she affords Spain.(b) The Spanish action would receive unfavourable publicity andmight be censured by the contracting parties.(c) Spain might in retaliation draw particular attention in any GATTdiscussion to alleged British contraventions of our obligations under the GATT, and in particular to the 15 per cent importcharge and the recently introduced export rebate scheme.(d) The propaganda advantage would probably rest with Britain and gibraltar.   But the material results would probably be nil.

(d)    Administrative Interference with the Imports of Spanish fruits,vegetables and Wines to the United Kingdom(i) The approximate value of this trade, which is important to spain, is as follows:-Citrus Fruits  63: millionTomatoes  3f millionPotatoes and Onions  5^ millionGrapes, Nuts, Melons andPreserved Fruit  6^ millionWine  8-1 millionThese imports are not subject to quotas, so that there is no scope for reducing thern under the guise of adjusting quotas.    But it would in theory-be possible to interfere with this trade by imposing administrative delays,e.g. , by intensifying the application to Spanish produce of the PlantHealth Control inspections.(ii) To discriminate in this way against a particular country would however be contrary to the practice of the Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries and would contravene the International Plant ProtectionConvention of 1951.    Any action cf this kind would also be difficult to applyadministratively.    Interference with imports would, moreover, be likelyto cause loss to British importers, since the majority of consignments of spanish fruit, vegetables and wine are owned by British importers fromthe time of their arrival at a British port.    The general effect of suchaction would therefore be to produce immediate and serious disadvantagesfor British importers and consumers.E.      Action in the Field of Civil AviationDepartments already have under consideration two points affectingB.E. A. &apos;s operations to Spain.    The first is a possibility that B.E. A. will wish to divert some of their Gibraltar services to A/Ialaga.    It arises as aresult of the Spanish restrictions at the Gibraltar frontier, which make the gibraltar route into Spain less attractive, even though the fare is cheaper,B.E.A. &apos;s present plan for this summer is to operate fifteen scheduledflights weekly to Gibraltar and three to Malaga.    B.E. A. have a highinvestment at Gibraltar and have a strong interest in maintaining their services to Gibraltar without any reduction of scale.   -However, if theSpanish restrictions continue they may be compelled to consider changing the proportion of flights in Malaga&apos;s favour.   They have agreed to warn the Ministry of Aviation if they want to do this.2.       The Minister of Aviation has no powers which would enable himto direct B.E, A. not to switch services from Gibraltar to Malaga.However, in this instance, in order to make the switch, B.E. A. wouldhave to ask him to ask the Spanish Government to give them additionaltraffic rights and the Minister could decline to do this.    This would ensure that scheduled traffic to Malaga does not benefit at the expense ofsuch traffic to Gibraltar but B.E. A. would face an overall loss of revenue.3.       The second point involves a proposal which would result in London-Malaga fares remaining at their present level and London-Gibraltar faresbeing increased by Z\ per cent.    By coincidence this proposal is being discussed in current International Air Transport Association negotiations.B. E. A. have proposed raising all fares to Spain (except for the service to-9-GGSMFs DE-NTS AL

Malaga) by 2\ per cent.    In return they would be prepared to raise theirfares to Gibraltar by Z\ per cent as a concession to the Spanish airline,Iberia.    At this juncture it would be discouraging for the Gibraltariansif the new arrangement came into force, since it would have the effect ofmaking the Malaga route more competitive with the Gibraltar one, andthe Minister of Aviation could decline to approve the proposed rise inthe Gibraltar fare.4,       The Spanish Government could, however, retaliate by refusing to approve the proposed new fares to Spain.    This in turn could upset thewhole IATA European fares agreement, a development which would notbe in our interests.5.      Neither of the possible courses of action described in paragraphs and 3 above can strictly speaking be regarded as constituting acts of retaliation and Civil Aviation does not indeed appear to offer a suitablefield for action of this sort.    In any case the Ministry of Aviation regard the Air Services Agreement at present in force between Spain and theUnited Kingdom as highly favourable to ourselves and would be reluctant to do anything which might upset it.    A general conflict in the field ofCivil Aviation would therefore be to our disadvantage as would any actionwhich might lead to such a general conflict.    For example, if wedeclined to allow Iberia Airlines to continue operating their share of theLondon-Malaga service, which they are doing on a temporary permit, theSpanish Government could respond be refusing to allow not  only  B.E. A.but also B. U. A. to fly to or through Malaga.F.      Harrassment of Spaniards in the United Kingdom(a)    Action against Spanish workers in this country(i) There are rather mere than 26,000 adult Spanish nationalsresident in the United Kingdom, of whom about 20, 000 are believed to bein employment.    The Ministry of Labour issues work permits toSpaniards at the rate of about 7, 000 per annum.      Spaniards are ableto remit their earnings to Spain but the total amount remitted is regarded by the Bank of England as insignificant and they have no record of the precise amounts involved.(ii) It has been suggested that one measure of retaliation againstSpain would be to cease the issue of new work permits to Spanishnationals and thus prevent them from coming here to take up employment.Those already here would not be affected if the Ministry of Labour wereto revoke their work permits, since these are regarded as immigration control documents rather than as residence and employment permits.But it would under existing legislation be possible to deport any or allSpaniards now living here.(iii) Action to end the issue of work permits would prevent6, 000-7, 000 Spaniards coming to the United Kingdom to work annually.It would deprive Spain of a minor source of foreign exchange.   But itwould also affect employers in the United Kingdom and in particular the hotel and catering trades, in which the bulk of Spanish workers are believed to be employed.-10-CONFIDENT1AL

CO..........85(iv) Action to deport Spaniards already working in the UnitedKingdom would deprive Spain of a further minor source of foreign exchange.   But it would involve using the Aliens Order in a way neverformerly employed in peace time.    It would also be likely to provokeSpanish retaliation against British subjects resident in Spain.(b)     Action against Spanish travellers to Britain(i) It has also been suggested that, by administrative action, her majesty&apos;s Government cculd subject Spanish travellers arriving in theUnited Kingdom to the same kind of delays and inconveniences as aresuffered by travellers at the Gibraltar frontier.(ii) It would, however, be very difficult to single out Spanishcitizens for such treatment at United Kingdom airports and ports.   Andeven if it proved possible to do so, such measures would invite retaliation against the far larger numbers of British travellers who visit Spain.G.      Action Against Spain&apos;s International position there may be opportunities of opposing Spain&apos;s interests in international organisations which she either belongs to or may wish tojoin.    No obvious opportunities for such action are apparent at presentand in deciding on our attitude in a particular case it would almost certainly be necessary to take other factors into account.   It seems inany event unlikely that action in this field v/ould cause the Spaniards anyserious difficulties or embarrassment.II.   THE LIKELY GENERAL CONSEQUENCES OF EFFECTIVERETALIATIONThe specific results which might be expected to fellow from anyof the measures of retaliation set out above have already been described.But it is also necessary to consider the likely results as a whole of any decision to take effective measures of retaliation against Sjjam.   It seems unlikely that a policy of retaliation on our part would cause the Spaniardsto lift the existing restrictions.    The probability is that they would fightback and if so we should be vulnerable in a number of v/ays.(i)  The Spanish Government could impose further restrictionson Gibraltar;  e.g.by withdrawing the Spanish labour forceand closing the frontier altogether.(ii)  They could embark on a trade war in which, for the reasonsset out in I. D. above, we might find ourselves the losers inthe long run.(iii)  They could withdraw or curtail facilities in the field of defence.Naval visits to Spain, with the opportunities they provide forrecreation, are of great importance to the Navy and are a significant factor in recruitment.    The withdrawal or curtail-ment of these facilities, which might follow on some anti-Spanish gesture by the British Government, would be a serious loss.    We are also dependent on Spanish goodwill for thecompletion of Anglo/American and NATO projects of operationalimportance.   This goodwill persists in spite of the cancellation of SPANEX, but could not be expected to survive any furtherpolitical blows.-11-COMFIDEMT1AL
