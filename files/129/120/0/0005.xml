confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1965 \C. (65) 515th January, 1965CABINETEDUCATIONAL BUILDING-MINOR WORKSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for education and ScienceFor purposes of administration the educational building projects of local education authorities are classified as major projects(exceeding  20,000) or minor works (under  20,000). Major building programmes for 1965-66 and 1966-67 had been fixed by the previous government, and while I consider that a strong case can be madefor adding to them I have accepted the view of the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer that the economic situation does not permit us to doso at the present time. The problem of minor works for 1965-66,however, presents more serious difficulty.2. Within the category of minor works there is a sub-category of &quot; mini-minor works &quot; which are not subject to control by myDepartment. The upper limit of size for these jobs has been  2,000,but the previous Government had announced before the election thatit would be raised to  2,500 for 1965-66. Since these jobs are notcontrolled only an estimate of what authorities are likely to spendon them can be made in advance; by agreement with the treasury the Department holds back from the total amount allotted by ministers for minor works a sum sufficient to cover this estimated expenditure. A further deduction is made for minor works carriedout by voluntary bodies which are controlled by the Department andthe remainder is distributed to local education authorities in Englandand Wales to devote to minor works of their own choosing.3. The previous Government fixed a total of  18 million forminor works for 1964-65. This was divided up before the beginningof the year as follows:&quot;Mini-minor&quot; Voluntary Others L.E.A.*  .        TotalReserve Projects Allocations 2-9 million  2 - 9 million     0 - 25 million    11-95 million    18 million* Including voluntary schools in Wales.But authorities displayed greater energy than had been foreseen,and in the first two quarters of the financial year had carried out&quot; mini-minor &quot; works to a value of  3-2 million; it is safe to assume that the figure for the whole year, when it is available, will exceedCopy No.&apos; (i&apos;:JK&apos;   . -mm-5290
 6 million. This means that over  21 million will have been spenton minor works in 1964-65.4. An announcement to authorities of their allocations for1965-66 is already overdue, but there are two difficulties to be faced.Our experience has shown that the concession under which&quot; mini-minor &quot; works are uncontrolled, welcome as it is to localeducation authorities is difficult to administer, and the figure of 19 million fixed by the previous Government for minor works in1965-66, which appears on paper to constitute an increase over1964-65, is in fact a reduction compared with what has actually been spent. I therefore submitted proposals to the Chief Secretary that ifthe total available for minor works for 1965-66 could be increasedto  23 million so that we could allow authorities to do just a littlemore than in 1964-65 I would withdraw the &quot;mini-minor&quot;concession and establish fully effective control over the whole minorworks sector. The Chief Secretary considered, however, that despite the attractions of this course he could not, in the difficult economicconditions, agree to even this modest increase.5. If no increase can be made in the  19 million programme for 1965-66 I shall have to continue the existing arrangements for&quot; mini-minor &quot; works and divide the total up as follows:&quot; Mini-minor&quot;       Voluntary Others L.E.A.* TotalReserve Projects Allocations 6-5 million       2-45 million     0-23 million     9-82 million     19 million* Including voluntary schools in Wales.The amount available for allocation to individual authorities will thus be over  2 million smaller than in the previous year, and the sums available for voluntary schools will also be smaller by about 0-5 million.6. Authorities are no doubt expecting more favourable treatment for the coming year than they received from the previous government. They have always been particularly sensitive to the limitations on minor works and when the facts become known therewill be an outcry, both in the country and in Parliament, and it willbe said, with truth, that authorities will be appreciably worse offthan under the previous Government. The adverse effect will be enhanced because the announcement of minor works allocations for1965-66 will be the first important practical decision since we took office affecting the material development of the education service inthe immediate future, and because it will appear against the background of the revelations as to the shortcomings of the schoolscontained in the School Building Survey. I consider that I should bring these facts to the notice of my colleagues and ask them toconsider whether the saving of some  4 million of capital expenditure is worth the real and lasting damage to the reputation of theGovernment in the field of education.M. S.Department of Education and Science,14th January, 1965.
