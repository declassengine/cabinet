CABINETPOST OFFICE finance memorandum by the Postmaster-general in pursuance of the policy initiated by the last Government in cmnd. 1337 (The Financial and Economic Obligations of the nationalised Industries) the Post Office has a financial targetexpressed as a return on net assets averaging 8 per cent over thefive years 1963-64 to 1967-68. (By &quot; return &quot; is meant profit asshown in the Accounts plus interest on borrowing plus supplementarydepreciation. Recent calculations are shown at pages 72-3 of thePost Office Report and Accounts 1963-64.)2. The present situation is that while Telecommunications arejust about on target, Posts are heavily in deficit. On the best forecaststhat can at present be made, performance is expected, at currenttariffs, to fall short of the 8 per cent return target (-) or exceed it (-1-)as follows:1963-64   1964-65   1965-66   1966-67   1967-68     5-yearAggregate	  m.	  m.	  m.	  m.	  in.	  in.Postal	-11	-20	-26	-33	-41	-131Telecommunications	4- 9	- 1	- 3	- 6	- 7	-   8The profits ( + ) and losses (-) contributing to these results are:1963-64   1964-65   1965-66   1966-67   1967-68     5-yearAggregate	  m.	  m.	  in.	  n i.	  in.	  in.Postal       ......	- 8	-18	 24	-31	-38	-119Telecommunications	4-39	-1-33	4-36	4-38	442	-1-188The major assumptions underlying these forecasts are annual growthsof 3^-4 per cent in G.D.P. and about 4 per cent in staff expenditure as a result of improved pay, hours, etc., which is below both currentexperience and the average rate of increase over the last 10 years.(1 per cent of current account staff expenditure is rather more than 2 million postal and  \\ million telecommunications.)3. The striking difference between the fortunes of the two services arises partly from past pricing decisions and partly from the differing character of the two services. Telecommunications arerapidly expanding, technically progressive and highly capitalised.They are thus currently able to finance considerable increases inTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.

wage rates and prices of materials out of gains in productivity. Onthe other hand the scope for mechanisation in Posts is more limited and presents special difficulties. This service has a very high labourcontent and cannot absorb rising costs to any great extent. Thus,in the past 10 years expenditure on Postal services was increased byimprovements in pay and other conditions of service to staffamounting to  83 million and by increased prices for purchases ofgoods and services amounting to  17 million, giving a total of  100million. Of this total,  83 million was met by increased charges to the customer,  12 million by reduction of profit and only  5 million(over the whole 10 years) by the excess of income from businessexpansion over the expenditure required to earn it (both at constant prices, etc.). The forecasts in paragraph 2 above assume, perhapsoptimistically, that the Postal services will now have an excess of income from business expansion over the expenditure required to earn it of about  3 million a year. But even this is only a little morethan is required to meet a 1 per cent pay award.4. The Government has stated its intention of maintaining thepolicy of financial targets for the nationalised industries. I am surethis is right and that the Post Office should be financed in such away as to provide for the ploughing back of a reasonable contribution from earnings to capital requirements and that its services ought not to be under-priced or subsidised. The Post Office has sufferednotably from under-investment, under-pricing, a wages policy thathas harmed recruitment and a tendency for the quality of its services to decline. Sound financial practice should help to improve matters.The Post Office has also found the target approach in practice toprovide valuable internal stimulus and financial discipline. Indeed,the Post Office had adopted policies consistent with Cmnd. 1337long before its publication. In fact the Post Office achieved an overallreturn of 8 per cent or more in each of the three years 1958-59 to5. I should not regard cross-subsidisation of Posts byTelecommunications (or vice versa) as economically sensible. In my view, the two services should compete fairly on price if the rightdivision of custom is to prevail. In any case, under the target policythere is clearly nothing to spare on tne Telecommunications side.6. The effect of Postal losses on the financing of the Post Office,and particularly the amount to be borrowed from the Exchequer,should also be noted. Following is the picture over five years consistent with the forecasts in paragraph 2 above:1960-61.Normal capital requirementsPostal losses        ......Postal  m.107119Telecoms.  171.978Combined  m.1,085119Total requirements ...2269781,204Financed by:Internal finance......Borrowing from Exchequer18208585603601
This shows plainly how Posts are now borrowing against current account losses (just like the Railways but less obviously). The totalborrowing from the Exchequer over the period would be reduced by 114 million if the tariff increases proposed in this memorandum hadeffect from 1st April, 1965.7. Continuance of the target policy requires the making good ofthe shortfall in Postal finance revealed in paragraph 2, as soon aspossible. I do not believe that the long-term answer can be found incutting services in quality or quantity. It may even require greaterexpenditure than at present to improve the standard of some services to an acceptable level. These factors, together with the generalpotentialities of technological progress, are dealt with more fully in annex 1.8. The fundamental lesson of Annex 1 is not that the presenttariff proposals can be avoided or even materially reduced. The Annexexamines the question whether this increase could be moderated by a drastic cutback in existing services. It shows clearly that the reductionof services provides no hope of avoiding continually rising prices tothe Postal customer, not even if wage increases are restricted to a figure consistent at the national average with 4 per cent growth inG.D.P. If there was a drastic cut now the customer would get a once for all advantage equivalent to about Id. on the full letter rate while leaving him, in any case, with the prospect that every year the pricewill rise by about Jd. And in the process the services would havedeteriorated to a level below that which is acceptable.9. I should like therefore to announce in the week beginning18th January increases in Postal tariffs as shown in Annex 2. Thefull-year value of these increases is  37 million. In terms of return, tomake good the 8 per cent five-year target over the remaining threeyears would strictly require  45 million. A yield of  37 million will,however, meet the target for 1965-66 and make some contribution tothe shortfalls in 1963-64 and 1964-65.10. It is perhaps worth mentioning that these changes are estimated to add only about 0-07 of a point to the cost-of-living index.Again, in considering the increase from 3d. to 4d. for the inland letter,it should be noted that the equivalent of the pre-war rate (l^d.) wouldbe over 5d. to-day in purchasing power. Yet again, out of 13 western european countries 8 have basic letter charges exceeding 4d. and3 of the exceptions (Italy, Portugal and Spain) give bad service.Sweden, Norway, the Irish Republic and Belgium all have a letterrate of over 5d. Looking at the matter still another way, the profit onPosts in the 1930s would be the equivalent of about  90 million to-day, whereas all that an 8 per cent target implies is an averageprofit of about  3 million a year.11. Annex 1 also contains a number of important policy decisions intended to be announced at the same time as the tariffincreases which will have far-reaching consequences for the postal services in the future. But they must be seen as a development of theservice, and of new services, not as an axing of existing services.
12. The pitch of the tariff proposals in this paper, and the policy outlined in Annex 1, have been discussed with the First Secretary ofState and the Chancellor of the Exchequer who accept the need forthe proposed increases. The engagement of consultants we have inmind McKinseys to investigate ways of -raising the level of productivity of the postal services has been agreed with them as an integral part of the operation.       -13. I attach at Annex 3 the draft of a White Paper which Ipropose to publish on the day I make my announcement.A. W. B.G.P.O. Headquarters, E.C.J,11th January, 1965.sec-Met
Annex 1ECONOMICS OF POSTAL SERVICECost of the inland postal service. In 1965-66 estimated expenditure on the inland postalservice will be  208 million. Staff costs account for  168 million. Theother sizeable element is contract payments for conveyance of mailamounting to  20 million. On these we are about to completenegotiations with the Railways which will give us a more favourablecontract for parcels, and account of this has been taken in our financial forecasts.2.   The staff costs of  168 million broadly sub-divide as follows:  million(a) Collection and delivery.........      78(b) Sorting (including associated processes)     64(c) Counter work    ............      11(d) Station services and miscellaneous    ...      15Quality of the postal service3. Due mainly to staff shortages in London and certainProvincial centres, the quality of the inland postal services is patchy.Traffic trends4. Ordinary inland traffic is buoyant. Our forecasts allow for a continued growth of postal business as a whole of 3 per cent perannum.Overall productivity5. Our forecasts allow for an improvement in profitability(expressed in real terms) of 1 per cent per annum of total expenditure.This is the result of increased business being absorbed withoutcommensurate increased costs, improved efficiency frommechanisation and other changes in methods, offset by such factors as housing developments which add to our delivery staff to the extentof some hundreds of postmen a year without producing additionalbusiness.Scope for staff economies6. As indicated in paragraph 3 above the service is sufferingbecause of shortage of staff. This could be remedied by the recruitment of part-time men and women and full-time women as apermanent feature of the postal service. To such recruitment theU nion of Post Office Workers is opposed except as a temporary measure. Indeed a recent attempt temporarily to recruit such staffin London based on an agreement designed to meet an acute shortageof full-time men lead to a threat of industrial action by the Londonconstituents of the Union. This attitude ignores the likely state of thelabour market in the foreseeable future.
Savings through restriction of services. Outside of London the present pattern of postal service givestwo deliveries in most places. A scheme has been considered wherebyin general only one delivery would be given everywhere starting at approximately the present time but in general not finishing until the afternoon; Within this pattern an attempt would be made to maintainpresent times of first delivery within the central business areas of towns. Collections would be on a reduced scale but would give anopportunity for reply the same day. Because of the effect on businessfirms outside the central areas it would be essential to provide anadequate private box service which would call for considerableadditional accommodation. It is estimated that a scheme of this sortwould save about  14 million per annum. The scheme would givesomething like the American pattern of delivery. Before embarking on such a scheme it would be essential to test public opinion on arepresentative scale, in effect posing the choice of higher charges or a reduced service. Even if public reaction was favourable thescheme would take two or three years to plan and implement, andlonger in some places if redundancy was cleared by natural wastage.It is clear therefore that a saving could not be achieved in time tohelp us without immediate financial problem.8. The scope for saving by adjusting the priorities in whichdifferent classes of mail are dealt with is limited: at the end of the day the total quantity of mail to be dealt with remains unaffected. But inorder to avoid the creation of unmanageable peaks of work, printedpapers corresponding roughly to third class mail in the UnitedStates if posted after about 4/4.30 p.m. are set aside in sortingoffices and dealt with after the evening rush is passed. In addition the Post Office offers rebates to large posters of printed papers roughly 5,000 items or more on condition that the posters make a preliminary sortation of the mail and agree to the Post Office havingseven days in which to handle it. The current tariff proposals providefor an extension of this system whereby the largest users of the postwill be offered even more favourable rebates and so encouraged todo more and more work. In respect of deferment of mail by class, weare already roughly in line with America.9. It is sometimes suggested that by withdrawing delivery tothe door, and making it only into letter receiving boxes at the gardengate, large savings could be made. In fact we estimate that they wouldbe about  2-3 million a year; this sum would be substantially reduced if the Post Office had to provide, erect and maintain the boxes.Future plans for postal modernisation10. It is right that at a time when the Post Office is asking forincreased tariffs it should, at the same time, make clear its owndetermination to push on as rapidly as possible with its modernisationprogramme. Some of the capital for this programme will have tocome out of the yield of the increased tariffs and some of it will haveto be borrowed. In the long run the return to the public will be yieldedin better services, a reduction of staff difficulties and greater economy
and convenience. Collection and delivery services are motorised tothe maximum economic extent. The sorting office is now the mainfield for mechanisation. Installation of mail-conveying and parcel-sorting machinery is going ahead as fast as the availability of machines and buildings permits. But the main savings will come frommechanisation of letter sorting. This presents problems which are only just beginning to yield to years of intensive research. It will not beuntil the late sixties that proven letter sorting machines will begin tobe installed in our large sorting offices.11. I propose specifically to undertake the following reviewsand make certain changes that I wish to announce at the same time as the tariff increases:(i) We shall review the postal mechanisation programme to seeif it can be speeded up. In this I shall work closely with theMinistry of Technology and the industry, not least to see whether we can open up an extended opportunity forexporting postal mechanisation equipment.(ii) We shall review the associated building programme inconjunction with the Ministry of Public Building and works to see whether this can be carried through more economically and more rapidly. This will become necessary if the pace of mechanisation is to be increased and in any case the provision of modern buildings forpostal work is an essential ingredient of a successfulrecruitment policy.(iii) We shall press ahead firmly with the introduction ofstandardised envelope sizes, which have now been agreedupon internationally by the UPU. Negotiations that havebeen going on, and are now going on, will be most effective if it is recognised that within a measurable timenon-standard envelopes will attract a higher tariff. I shall therefore fix a firm date for the introduction of such a tariff after consultation with the envelope manufacturers and the stationery trade. In addition to the necessity forstandardisation imposed on us by mechanisation, oneconsequential effect of standardisation in Britain mightwell be to give us the advantage of being one of the firstcountries in the world offering entirely standard sizes inits export trade. I shall ask the co-operation of mycolleagues responsible for other Departments and the chairmen of the Nationalised Boards of Industry, LocalGovernment and other semi-public bodies, to introducestandard sizes, as early as possible.(iv) We shall also now press ahead with plans for a nationalpostal coding system to cover the whole country. Ourexperiments, in which the people of Norwich have beenco-operating so readily, show that properly planned andintroduced postal codes yield economies. The progressiveintroduction of codes throughout the country will be essential if the full benefits of postal mechanisation, both
operational and economic, are to be got. This will necessarily take some time but we shall set in hand the detailed studies required,(v) We shall also undertake a major review of the postal servicesoffered to see whether or not they can be more closelygeared to meet modern needs and more efficiently handled by us. Among the possibilities that we are considering isthe establishment of priority letters, and the reorganisation of fully paid letters and printed papers on a new basis that relates the cost to speed of transit rather than thenature of the matter contained in the packet. We arealso considering the possibility of introducing a cheaperdeferred message card which would offer a largerpostcard type service at a slower rate. One definiteexperiment will be made in the coming year. This will bethe testing of a Post Office Christmas card for sale tothe public through Post Offices. This Christmas card probably a series of six separate cards will be of standardsize, will be sold complete with the necessary stamp orfrank and will be highly competitive in price with thoseoffered by the stationery trade. The low price for cardand stamp combined will have one condition attached toit. To be guaranteed delivery by Christinas it will haveto be posted by a certain date possibly 15th December.In this way we shall use our own card to help to even out some of the peaks in the Christmas period. I also hopethat this card will be a revenue raiser.(vi) We shall engage a leading firm of industrial consultants tocarry out a fundamental and widely based investigation into ways of raising the level of productivity of the postal services.

POST,OFFICE TARIFFS1. This White Paper deals with the financial problems of the postal servicesand announces the measures that it is proposed to take to deal with them.I. FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS2. In the White Paper &quot; The Financial and Economic Obligations of the nationalised Industries &quot; (Cmnd. 1337), published in 1961, the last Governmentinitiated the policy that each Nationalised Industry should earn a sufficientreturn on its capital assets to provide from its own profits an adequate contri-bution to its capital requirements. This policy was confirmed by the present government when, in answer to a question on the 22nd December, 1964, theChancellor of the Exchequer stated that it was intended to retain and develop the system of financial objectives for the nationalised industries, followingCmnd. 1337.3. The financial objective agreed for the Post Office is that it should earn a return on net assets averaging 8 per cent over the five years 1963-64 to 1967-68.(&quot; Return &quot; means profit, as shown in the Accounts, plus interest on borrowingand supplementary depreciation). The Post Office had adopted policiesconsistent with Cmnd. 1337 some yeais earlier and had achieved an overallreturn of 8 per cent or more on its net assets in each of the three years 1958-59to 1960-61.4. The Post Office needs to achieve its financial objective if it is to be ableto plough back a reasonable contribution from its earnings to the capital requirements with which it is faced as it expands to meet public needs. failure to meet the objective as a result of under-pricing of Post Office services would lead to under-investment, and a worsening of the quality of service providedfor the public.II. PRESENT AND FORECAST5. For the first three years of the five-year target period referred to in para-graph 3, the performance of the postal and telecommunications services isexpected, at current tariffs, to fall short of the 8 per cent objective (-) orexceed it (-)-) as follows :1963-64   1964-65   1965-66    Total m.         m.         m.         m.Postal services......- 11      - 20     - 26     - 57Telecommunications     ..      ..-(-9      -   1      -   3      +   5The profits and losses contributing to these results are :1963-64 1964-65 1965-66 Total m.         m.         m.  m.Postal services Loss    .. -   8      - 18 - 24 - 50Telecommunications-Profit   ..   4-39      -I- 33 -(- 36 -f 1086. While the telecommunication services are expected to earn sufficientprofits in aggregate to meet the 8 per cent financial target, the postal services

are heavily in deficit, and the deficit is growing. The reasons for this strikingdifference in the financial performance of the two services are partly pastpricing decisions and partly the differing character of the services. The tele-communication services are rapidly expanding, technically progressive andintensively capitalised. They are therefore able to finance substantial increases in the prices of labour and materials out of gains in productivity. The postal services, on the other hand, employ a very large labour force and comparatively little capital, and scope for the mechanisation of these services is more limited.The restricted scope for absorbing rising costs on the postal services is illustrated by the experience of the past ten years. In that period improvements in pay and conditions of service of staff have cost the postal services about 83m. and increases in the prices for purchases of goods and services another 17m. Of this total increase in expenditure,  83m. was met by increased charges to the customer,  12m. by reduction of profit and only  5m. (over thewhole ten years) by the excess at constant prices of business expansion overthe expenditure required to meet it.7. The shortfall in the performance of the postal services must be made goodif the financial objective set for the Post Office is to be achieved. It would not make economic sense for the postal services to be subsidized by the telecommunications-munication services ; the right pricing policy should be adopted for both. Inany case, the margin between performance and target for the telecommunicationsservices is negligible.III. ALTERNATIVE TO INCREASES IN POSTAL CHARGES8. As an alternative to increasing postal charges to avoid the prospectivedeficit in 1965-66, the Post Office has considered the possibility of a reductionin the services given to the public. But even the most drastic cutback in existing services would not save enough money to postpone an early increasein postal tariffs. A cut in services, once achieved, could not be repeated andin the process the services provided for the public would have deteriorated toan unacceptable level.IV. POSTAL CHARGES9. To meet the shortfall in the performance of the postal services and toprovide part of the capital required for the modernisation programme described in Section V, it is proposed to increase the charges for certain postal service as follows. The minimum charge for inland letters will be increased to 4d. butthe minimum weight step will be raised to 2 oz. in place of the present 1 oz.There will be increases at other weight steps. The charges for inland postcards,printed papers and samples, newspapers and parcels will also be increased :there will, however, be a larger rebate for bulk postings of 250,000 or moreprinted papers. Express service fees will be raised to meet the true cost. Thecharges for letters and postcards sent by surface route to commonwealth countries will be brought into line with the domestic rate : the charges for other overseas services will not be increased. Details of the changes proposed are set out in the Annex. They include the abolition of inland charges on articlesfor the blind (at present  d. up to 2 lb. etc.) which will in future go free. Theywill all operate from 1st April, 1965.2

10. The increase in the charge for inland letters is necessary if sufficientrevenue is to be raised to meet the financial obligations of the Post Office andif the right relationship is to prevail between the charges for inland letters andfor other inland correspondence services. Increasing the minimum weight stepfor inland letters from 1 oz. to 2 oz. results in a decrease in the charge for lettersbetween 1 oz. and 2 oz. The other services for which charges are being raisedre all losing money. The acreases proposed for these services are as high asthey can reasonably be in relation to the proposed charge for inland letters.The charges for a number of services, including airmail correspondence, over-seas parcels, registration and insurance services and postal orders and moneyorders, are not being changed.11. The proposed increases in postal charges are expected to yield additional revenue amounting to  37m. in a full year. This should be sufficient to meetthe shortfall on target which would otherwise have been expected in 1965-66and make some contribution towards the deficits in 1963-64 and 1964-65.12. The changes proposed will have a negligible etfect on the cost of living(the addition of only about 0 -07 of a point to the index). The proposed inlandletter rate of 4d. would be lower than the basic letter charge in most western european countries. It would also be lower than the equivalent at to-day&apos;spurchasing power of the pre-1939 rate of 14-d.V. FUTURE POSTAL PLANS13. The Post Office is constantly seeking ways of modernising the postal services and improving their productivity. Industrial and management consultants are already studying particular problems in staff to work relation-ships in sorting offices, and in the handling of parcels traffic. A more funda-mental and wider based investigation into ways of raising the level of productivity of the postal services will also be commissioned. The forecasts of performancein paragraph 5 allows for the short-term financial gain from the modernisationschemes in hand.14. The Post Office intends to proceed with its plans for the modernisation of the postal services as rapidly as possible. Some of the capital for its pro-gramme of postal mechanisation will come from the yield from the proposed increases in charges and some will have to be borrowed. In the long run, thereturn to the public from these plans will be better services, few staff difficulties and greater economy and convenience. It must be emphasised, however, thatthe financial savings from mechanisation at present foreseeable, even in the longrun, are not of a sign which would revolutionise the economics of the postal services. The most promising field for mechanisation is in the sorting of letterswhere intensive research is now yielding results... But the installation of provenletter sorting machines in large sorting offices will, on present plans, only begin in the late sixties. In co-operation with the Ministry of Technology andIndustry, it is hoped to speed up the postal mechanisation programme. At thesame time the associated building programme is being reviewed by the PostOffice and the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works to see whether it can be implemented more economically and more rapidly.3

4SECRET15. The other plans in prospect are :(a) It is intended to press ahead firmly with the introduction of thestandardised envelope sizes which have now been agreed inter-nationally. After consultation with the stationery trade, a firm datewill be fixed for the introduction of a higher tariff for non-standardenvelopes. Co-operation will be sought from Government Depart-ments, Nationalised Industries and local authorities to introducestandard sizes of envelopes as soon as possible.(b) A national postal coding system, which is essential to the full successof postal mechanisation, will be devised for progressive introductionthroughout the whole country.(c) A major review of the postal services offered to the public is being undertaken to see whether or not they can be more closely gearedto modern needs. Among the possibilities being considered is theestablishment of priority letters, the introduction of a deferredmessage card and the sale of a Post Office Christmas card at a competitive price but which would only be guaranteed delivery byChristmas if posted at a stated early date.
