The square brackets enclosing the sentence onthis point in paragraph 18 of the draft Yfhite Paper annexed to C.

We would also like to make drafting amendments in the concluding paragraph.Revised versions of paragraphs 25 and 27 are attached.W,R,R.H.S.C.Whitehall, S.W.I.16th March, 196559COPY NO.   &apos;_

RENT BILL;  DRAFT WHITE PAPERRevised paragraph 25&quot;Harassment25.     The Protection from Eviction Act made it an offence to evict,without a court order, a tenant whose right to go on living in his homehad already expired.    Clause 24 of the Bill makes it an offence tointimidate a tenant who is still legally entitled to occupy his presenthome.    Anyone who interferes with the peace and comfort of a tenantwith the object of persuading hirn to give up possession or to refrain from exercising his legal rights will be liable on summary convictionto a fine up to  100 (or  500 for a second offence) or six months1imprisonment or both.    The provisions follow closely those in theNew York Police Statute to which attention was drawn in the report ofthe Milner Holland Committee (Cmnd. 2605). &quot;Revised paragraph 27&quot;27,     Still less is the Bill a solution of the housing shortage.    its main purpose is to give tenants full security and regulated rents in the peculiar conditions of scarcity now prevailing.    To remedy thisscarcity is the first priority in the Governments housing policy. &quot;
