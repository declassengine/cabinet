THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC M\JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. February 1965C. (65) 14 Copy No.   g g3rd February, 1965CABINETNEW TOWN FOR MANCHESTERMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeIn view of the importance of the implications for distributionof industry policy of a decision in favour of Leyland/Chorley, I amsetting out separately my views on the First Secretary&apos;s memorandum(C. (65) 13).2. Under present distribution of industry policy, our efforts are concentrated on getting industry to the areas of high unemployment,in order to make the fullest use of the country&apos;s labour resources.The Local Employment Acts limit financial assistance andinducements to these areas the &quot; development districts&quot;. Beforechanging this policy we ought to consider the implications.3. The basic issue is one of priorities. Any change in thedirection of providing financial inducements to other areas wouldworsen the position of the development districts. There is still not enough &quot; movable &quot; industry to meet the needs of all areas that need it. With the first priority that the development districts now have,they secured in 1964 (a record year) projects estimated to provide48,000 jobs. But there are still on average 140,000 unemployed in thedevelopment districts, over one-third of the country&apos;s total. If weprovide inducements to industry elsewhere especially in placeswhich might otherwise be more naturally attractive to industry itwill inevitably be at the expense of the areas of high unemployment.I do not say that so important a change should never be made. but before making it, we ought to consider the effects and, moreparticularly, how to avoid imperilling the economic recovery of the under-employed areas.4. Then there are the financial implications. Assistance underthe Local Employment Acts in all forms (factories, loans and grants)to industry in the development districts is at present running at about 30 million a year. We ought to assess the likely cost before embarking on an extension of this assistance outside development districts. Leyland/Chorley will presumably not be the only newtown or &quot; growth centre &quot; which the regional plans will put forward as places for which new industry is needed. There may also be5348
arguments for providing industry in places suffering from severedepopulation. If, therefore, we extended the areas under which theinducements are available, we should need to consider the cost and how it might be met. Without such a study, I should be very reluctant to modify the scale of assistance provided or revise the conditions onwhich it is available.5. I certainly do not want at this stage to exclude the possibilityof giving financial inducements to industry on grounds other thanhigh unemployment. But we should not make a major change ofpolicy on the facts of one particular case. For these reasons, andbearing in mind that we shall need shortly to formulate new legislation to replace the Local Employment Acts which expire inMarch 1967,1 think we should now examine carefully the alternativesfor distribution of industry policy as a whole. I have already instructedmy officials to put in hand a complete review of this policy inconsultation with other interested Departments.6. In the meantime, and until the results of this review areavailable, I would strongly advise that we make no commitment to change our policy in respect of Leyland/Chorley. Such a commitmentwould be premature, it would prejudice consideration of future policy;and it would also cause immediate concern in the present under-employed areas, in Scotland, Wales, the North-East and Merseyside,and call into question the Government^ intentions towards these areas. Any public hint of such a major change in policy could indeedcause a hold-up in firms&apos; present plans to build in development districts.7. Leyland/Chorley is a long-term scheme; it could not comeinto effect until the 1970s. We ought not to rush into a prematuredecision on it. I suggest, therefore, that the best immediate solutionof the problem would be to announce a limited commuterdevelopment for Manchester&apos;s overspill. I had previously suggestedBury, but if the Minister of Housing and Local Government feels that a commuter development could after all be provided at Risley,I would see no objection, either instead of Bury (if houses for 40,000people can be provided at Risley), or in addition to it (if houses for only 15,000 can be provided). On either basis, this should go a longway towards solving the problem for some years ahead. I shouldhave thought some office dispersal from Manchester to Bury andRisley would also be possible. In view of this, a decision onLeyland / Chorley should, in my view, be deferred until we have beenable to consider, in the light of distribution of industry policy as awhole, the implications of providing financial inducements to industryto establish itself in this kind of place.D. J.Board of Trade, S.W.1,2nd February, 1965.
