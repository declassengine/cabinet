SECRET137US DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)59C. (65) 21 COPY NO.     &quot;10th February, 1965CABINETHOUSING programme memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Minister of Housing proposes to issue approvals for156, 000 local authority houses (including 6, 000 for new towns) in 1965in England and Wales,Effect on Public Expenditure Programming2.       On 28th January the Cabinet approved my proposals for thelong-term programming of public expenditure as set out in C. (65) 10.The 1964/65 figure for housing investment in that paper was  506 million,and this provided for expenditure by local authorities and new towns inEngland and Wales on a work done basis equivalent to 130, 000 houses.The corresponding figure in the &quot;basic programme&quot; for 1969/70 was 557 million, and the corresponding element in this for expenditureon houses was the equivalent of 145,000.    Thus the Minister isproposing a build-up in the housing programme for England and wales which would rapidly raise the annual, level of expenditure well above that which I envisaged over the period to 1969/70.    Approvals at therate of 156,000 a year, if maintained, would quickly raise the annual rate of expenditure to the equivalent of 11,000 houses (say,  33 million at present prices) over the rate which I envisaged for 1969/70.    thus the Minister of Housing would be pre-empting a large part of the &quot;kitty&quot;,the distribution of which between the various claimants for additional public expenditure would, on the basis of my proposals, have to be leftuntil July.    (An explanation of housing statistics is given in the Annex).Immediate Issues3. The economic indicators all show that we have at present full employment - indeed, over-employment in many areas, resulting in arising level of demand.    It will clearly aggravate this problem if weinflate public expenditure on housing, without cuts elsewhere, since this will have to be financed by increased public borrowing when thehouses are started.    This, and not the impact on the Exchequer billfor housing subsidies, is the crucial financial issue.4.       We ought also to think about the burden on the construction industry, where we have increased other programmes besides thatfor housing.    I have just agreed to an extra  5 million for hospital building in 1965/66, which is an increase of 15 per cent over theprovision for the previous year.    Educational investment in 1965/66will be 10 per cent over the previous year; and the corresponding

figure for expenditure on roads will be up by 12 per cent.    This is a formidable programme, and I think it would be optimistic to assume that we can carry it out, and in addition agree to the Minister ofHousingIs proposals, without running into a substantial degree ofoverload in the construction industries.5.       The Minister of Housing implies that he might control and cutback private housing.    But at the same time we are talking in termsof a drive to make house purchase easier, and this is hardly likelyto discourage private building.    Nor could the Minister take powers intime to have any impact on starts in 1965; and the knowledge that such powers were to be taken would stimulate private starts.6.       It is true that industrialised building can help with the load onthe construction industry.    But to the extent that it succeeds it willabsorb additional resources and therefore add to the load on the economy.    In effect, the danger would then be that we were puttingtoo many resources into construction, with the result that otherinvestment and exports might suffer, unless cuts are made elsewhere.conclusion.      My original proposal to the Minister was that he should holdapprovals in 1965 to the rate of 135, 000, at least until such time aswe were ready to determine finally the permissible rate of public expenditure on housing in the longer-term.    This figure was based onthe number of approvals that I understood had been given in 1964.I have since learned that actual approvals in 1964 had reached thesurprisingly high total of 144, 000.    I can quite see that it would bedifficult for the Minister to attempt to hold local authorities to a rateof approvals below that which they secured last year - even though, ifhe had been prepared to accept my figure, the number of houses built in 1965 would still have been considerably more than in 1964 becauseof the large number of houses under construction.    In the circumstances,I would strongly recommend that we agree to a figure of 144, 000 forapprovals in 1965 (to cover both local authorities and new towns inEngland and Wales).    I am sure that this is as far as we should go.L. J. C.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.10th February, 1965

SECRET139ANNEXHousing StatisticsThe problem of moving from figures of housing approvals to expenditure on housing is complicated by the facts that housing startsare spread throughout the year and that it takes something like fifteen months to build a house.    Suppose, for example, we start from theMinisters figure of 156,000 approvals in 1965.    Local authorities will already have an accumulation of outstanding approvals from 1964,and therefore the number of houses actually started in 1965 will depend on the extent to which this accumulation is run down by theend of the year.    The amount actually spent on house construction in any year (the basis of the &quot;work done&quot; figures which I give inparagraph 2 of my paper) depends in part on the number of startsand in part on the number of completions; and it is generally assessed by taking the average of the two.      This is in effect a way of allowing for the fact that the number of houses under construction at the endof the year may be different from that at the beginning.    Thus it isnot easy to be precise about the effect on expenditure of approvals of156,000 houses in any particular year.    What can be said, and what i have said, is that, if we had reached a steady state with approvalsat 156, 000 a year, when this was also the number started and thenumber completed, it would mean that we were building 11, 000 housesa year more than I envisaged in rny &quot;basic&quot; public expenditure programme for 1969/70.-3-
