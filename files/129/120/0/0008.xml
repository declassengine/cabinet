THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1965C. (65) 8 Copy No.     5922nd January, 1965CABINETFARM PRICE review memorandum by the Secretary of State for the home department, the Secretary of State for Scotland andthe Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food we must now consider our general approach to this year&apos;s farm price Review which starts with the farmers on 10th February.2. This is the background. Under the Agriculture Acts of 1947and 1957, to which we are pledged, the value of the guaranteesprovided to farmers may not be reduced by more than 2\ per cent,i.e., approximately  38 million, less the net change in their costs. Thisyear costs have increased by about  28 million. This means that theminimum determination we could make would be to reduce the valueof the guarantees by  10 million.3. In addition the industry was assured in the White Paper ofDecember 1960 (Cmnd. 1249) that, taking one year with another, itwould normally be left with a share of the annual gain from increasing efficiency, which is at present assessed at  25 millionalthough the Government reserved the right, in exceptional circumstances, to make the minimum determination. On the basis thatthe industry was permitted to retain only half the gain from efficiency,i.e.,  12^ million, we should need to increase the value of the guarantees by  15-J million.4. In the circumstances of this year we think that these twofigures set broadly the lower and upper limits of the Reviewdetermination that we should have in mind. We set out in thefollowing paragraphs the main considerations which we should take into account in deciding our general approach.5. As a Party we have always said that our policy was tomaintain a stable and reasonably prosperous agricultural industry.We have stressed the contribution which agriculture makes to thenational economy. Its record has been good. Over the last 10 yearsproductivity has increased each year by 5 per cent. Output has gone up by 33 per cent while the labour force has gone down by 25 percent. Annual expenditure on food imports has been reduced by5311
 250 million. It is in our view vital that we should do nothing to disturb the confidence of the industry, and so put at risk agriculture^present and potential contribution to the national economy, moreparticularly in our present balance of payments difficulties.6. But equally we must have in mind the cost to the exchequer of the support we give to the industry. We cannot afford in presentcircumstances to see any significant increase in this. In recent years it has been running at an annual level of about  300 million. In thepresent year it was expected to rise to about  320 million. In factowing to the limitations that have been placed upon the guarantees(e.g., standard quantities) and to fairly firm market prices, the costis likely tc^be considerably lower about  270 million. Next year itis expected that with somewhat lower market prices the cost will risebut it is still likely to be under  300 million.7. The Agriculture Act of 1947, which was one of thelandmarks of the postwar Labour Government, stated that a primary purpose of the guarantee system was to give the industry reasonableremuneration. The income of the industry is therefore a crucial question. Before this year the industry&apos;s income had for a period ofthree years remained at much the same level and farmers had beenlosing ground as compared with other industries. When we were in opposition we argued that the Conservatives were then treating theindustry unfairly. This year the net income of the industry hasincreased largely as a result of the generous award given a year agoby the Conservative Government. Although final figures are not yet available, it is likely that income, on the basis of normal weather conditions, has increased by about the same amount as last year&apos;saward, i.e.,  31 million.8. The farmers will regard this improvement as the first step in their declared policy of remedying past under-recoupment of costs and of redressing the unfavourable position of agriculture vis-a-vis the rest of the community. Their aim is to increase their income by25 per cent about  100 million in the three years commencing in1964-65. They will argue that this year we should give them a furtherboost towards their goal. They will also stress the contribution whichagriculture is making to the balance of payments and which, they willsay, could be increased still further. They will undoubtedly compareour determination this year with the  31 million given by theConservative Government last year. We do not suggest that in thisyear&apos;s circumstances we could give anything like this amount. Forthis reason we cannot hope that the outcome of this year&apos;s Reviewwill be agreed with the farmers. But nevertheless we must aim at an award which we can defend to the industry and to the nation as reasonable.9. In the light of these general considerations we think that aminimum determination of minus  10 million would be politicallyindefensible. This would mean we would be making farmers notonly absorb all their increased costs, but also take a further cut.But, equally, while in normal years we would not think itunreasonable to allow farmers to keep half of their increasing
efficiency, we consider that, in the circumstances of this year&apos;economic difficulties, an award of plus  154- million thoughsubstantially less than what the farmers would regard as adequate would appear to the country at large as being too generous andwould be difficult to justify. In our view, therefore, the aim shouldbe to make a determination which would permit farmers to keep asmall part of their increasing efficiency, so giving them a reasonableincentive, while at the same time expecting them to bear a substantial part of their increased costs. We think that the kind of criterionwhich we have applied in other sectors, for example, the railways,of an industry bearing two-thirds of its increased costs is not unreasonable. This would lead to an award of about plus  10 million.It would mean that we were expecting farmers to absorb about 18 million in increased costs while allowing them to retain only about  7 million of their increasing efficiency, which would represent an increase of about \\ per cent in their net income in the coming year.10. We think that an analysis of the position of the differentcommodities reinforces this view. Cereals production is continuing toincrease rapidly. Although this year&apos;s record crop of \2\ million tonswill cut the bill for cereals imports substantially, our international obligations now require us to take remedial action to restore a fair and reasonable balance between domestic production and imports.Our principal suppliers, the Americans, Canadians, Australians andArgentina, have made it clear that they expect us to honour our obligations if the agreements to support our minimum import prices(on which the standard quantities depend) are to survive. We must therefore make substantial cuts in the guaranteed prices for wheat and barley. We must also cut substantially the guaranteed price foreggs which are in over-supply and where the Exchequer bill is increasing rapidly.11. On the other hand, beef is in short supply. World supplies are inadequate; prices are high; and this situation is likely to continueover the next five years. Our domestic supplies have been falling off.Although it will take several years to increase production, we muststart now. In the years to come more beef will help considerablywith our rising food import bill. We consider therefore that it isnecessary to increase profitability for beef production. In themeantime we must not take any action to reduce sheep or pig production as mutton, lamb, pork and bacon are to some extentreplacing beef on the consumers&apos; table. Moreover on balance of payment grounds we do not want to reduce our bacon production.12. In addition, we think we must give some furtherencouragement to milk production, particularly as a large part ofour beef supplies come from the milk herd. In spite of increases inthe guaranteed price in the past two years (the last one wassubstantial) the milk industry does not seem to have regained full confidence. Production has been falling off and as yet shows nomarked sign of recovering. Our butter production has fallen to very low levels although world butter supplies are scarce and prices arehigh. Because of our obligations to New Zealand and Australia, we
 250 million. It is in our view vital that we should do nothing to disturb the confidence of the industry, and so put at risk agriculture^present and potential contribution to the national economy, moreparticularly in our present balance of payments difficulties.6.

We think that an analysis of the position of the differentcommodities reinforces this view. Cereals production is continuing toincrease rapidly. Although this year&apos;s record crop of \2-\ million tonswill cut the bill for cereals imports substantially, our international obligations now require us to take remedial action to restore a fair and reasonable balance between domestic production and imports.Our principal suppliers, the Americans, Canadians, Australians andArgentina, have made it clear that they expect us to honour our obligations if the agreements to support our minimum import prices(on which the standard quantities depend) are to survive. We must therefore make substantial cuts in the guaranteed prices for wheat and barley.

Production has been falling off and as yet shows nomarked sign of recovering. Our butter production has fallen to very low levels although world butter supplies are scarce and prices&apos; arehigh. Because of our obligations to New Zealand and Australia, we
must be careful to avoid over-stimulation, but we believe that a failure to increase the guaranteed price this year might well endangerour future milk supplies for manufacture. Moreover milk is one ofthe most important commodities for the smaller farmer. For these reasons we think that some increase in the guaranteed price isnecessary even though under present arrangements the cost will fallon the consumer not the Exchequer. The rise in the retail milk price would however not exceed \d. per pint for four months of the yearand could be postponed till the summer.13. Finally we think that it is important in this Review to makea start on reorientating support as far as possible to help those whoare in special need, for example the farmers in the hills and uplands,and those smaller farmers who can improve their business efficiencyif encouraged to do so. This would accord with our promises inelection speeches to help the smaller farmer. We think therefore thatwe must make a modest start in encouraging agriculturalco-operation and in providing better agricultural credit facilities,while we should also extend the small farmer scheme giving it atthe same time a greater emphasis on more efficient farm management.In the hills we should give more help on the hill cow and hill sheepsubsidies. This would help to maintain prosperity, and so assist the promotion of the balanced regional development at which we areaiming.14. Taking into account these different aims on commodities production grants, we think that if our help in those cases where we want to give encouragement is to be meaningful we need on balance to give more than we take away. This reinforces our general view that our aim should be to give a reasonable, but by no means a generous, &quot; plus &quot; award in the Review.Conclusion15. We hope that for the reasons given in this paper our colleagues will agree that this year we should aim to make a finalaward that would increase the value of the guarantees by about 10 million. This would allow us to carry through the programmewe need to keep beef and milk production up to requirements, andto give more help to those sections of farming which are in greaterneed. Even so we shall be making farmers shoulder a substantial part of the increased costs, and we shall be doing very little toimprove farm incomes. If we do this, we must expect great disappointment among farmers, and a disagreed Review. but nevertheless we think that in the present difficult circumstances wecould defend and justify such a determination.F.
