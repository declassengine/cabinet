PART IDEFENCE policy the Legacy1. The present Government has inherited defence forces which are seriously over-stretched and in some respects dangerously under-equipped.The expenditure of over  20,000m. since 1952 has failed to provide thenecessary incentive for voluntary recruitment in some vital fields or toproduce all the weapons needed for current tasks. There has been no real attempt to match political commitments to military resources, still less to relate the resources made available for defence to the economic circum-stances of the nation. The 1963-64 estimates provided for an expenditureof  1,838m. while those for 1964-65 provided for  1,998, an increaseof 8-7 per cent, or more than 5-5 per cent, in real terms. The plans for1965-66 which we inherited would have made necessary estimates of 2,176m. a further increase of 8-9 per cent, or 5-1 per cent, in real terms.Yet the previous Governments White Paper on Public Expenditure(published last February) envisaged an annual increase in defence expendi-ture of only 3\ per cent, on the assumption, not so far fulfilled, that thenational wealth would rise 4 per cent, each year. To continue along theselines would mean imposing an increasing burden on the British peoplewhich none of their competitors in world trade are carrying. It would mean that Britain was steadily raising the percentage of her national incomedevoted to defence at a time when Russia and the United States werereducing theirs. Moreover, there is no guarantee in the plans of the previous government that this expenditure would give value for money or provideour forces at the right time with the arms they need.2. The present Government has therefore set in train a series of studieson defence policy ; these will cover the effects on force levels and capabilities of a number of different possible courses of action. In thelight of these studies it will be possible to review our strategy taking intoaccount not only the economic position but also new or reaffirmed political objectives which our strategy must be designed to implement. The purposeof these studies will be to try to ascertain the means by which defence expenditure during the next few years may be reduced to roughly thepresent figure in real terms. Meanwhile steps have already been takento ensure that the immediate needs of our forces will be met at a cost which the nation can afford.The Problems3. Britain&apos;s defence policy has two purposes: to guarantee the nation&apos;s security and to contribute towards peace and stability in the world as awhole. These purposes are inseparable. Neither can be achieved by armed force alone.4. In the long run the security of Britain, like that of every other country, can be assured only by general and comprehensive disarmament
under the United Nations ; even in the short run it will be difficult to main--tain unless countries of different political ideologies reach greater under-standing on the limitation and control of armaments. Meanwhile Britain&apos;s security will depend on alliances with her friends in many parts of the&apos;worlds Interdependence is the only basis for national security in the nuclear age.5. Similarly, world peace and stability can best be assured by strengthen-ing the peace-keeping powers of the United Nations, and this must remainour principal objective. But until the United Nations is able to exercise the responsibility for maintaining world peace, Britain must, to meet her obligations to Commonwealth and allied countries, maintain a capacity for providing miltary assistance in many parts of the world.6. One central problem is how to provide for the present needs ofmilitary defence through alliances without impeding our fundamental objec-tives of arms control and disarmament through the United Nations. Theother central problem is how to meet those military responsibilities through-out the world from which we cannot honourably or prudently withdraw,without causing too great a drain on our resources and so frustratingour other national purposes at home and abroad. This latter problem isparticularly formidable in an era when the cost of weapons tends to risevery much faster than the nation&apos;s wealth. For example, between 1963 and1968 the capital cost of equipping an Armoured regiment in B.A.O.R. willdouble (on 1964 prices) ; a Gunner regiment in the same theatre will costthree times as much ; and an infantry battalion six times as much. Thereis a similar escalation to be found in the Royal Air Force. The cost ofthe latest Lightning (Mark 3) is about six times that of the latest Hunter(Mark 6). In the Fleet Air Arm a Sea Vixen costs approximately seventimes as much as its predecessor the Sea Venom. Meanwhile, if our armed Forces are to attract and hold voluntary recruits, their pay and allowances will have to rise with wages and salaries in civilian life.Thus, steadily increasing economic pressure on the Defence Budget willface Britain, like other countries in the world, with the choice betweenrenouncing certain strategic options altogether and increasing still furtherher reliance on military co-operation with her allies.7. Britain has hitherto sought to maintain three major roles: to support a strategic nuclear force, to make a major contribution towards the defenceof Western Europe inside N.A.T.O., and to assist in keeping the peace else-where overseas. In order to reconcile defence expenditure with other claims on our resources we have to review the balance between these three mainroles. We cannot expect to fix the balance permanently in any one pattern.Political change will continue throughout the world, requiring constantrevision of our defence posture. But we must have a plan fitted to theneeds of the foreseeable future and to our means of meeting them.8. Such a plan requires us to clarify the political assumptions under-lying our defence policy, both in respect of the threat to our survival andof the part which armed forces can play in supporting Britain&apos;s inter-national objectives. We must work out the implications of these assumptionsfor the forces we need, the weapons they must bear, and the organisationand control of our total defence effort.
The Threat9. The only direct threat to our survival would be a major nuclear wararising from a direct conflict between East and West. This can be almostentirely excluded as a result of the present state of mutual deterrence, and,bearing in mind the high risk that any conflict in Europe would escalate,deliberate aggression, even on a limited scale, is unlikely in this theatre.10. An evolution in both Soviet and Western thinking, brought aboutpartly by increased understanding of the consequences of nuclear warfare,has therefore much reduced the likelihood of war between the Soviet andthe Western alliances and gives grounds for hope of progress in the limitationand control of arms and of a still more stable relationship.11. Nevertheless we must maintain our guard. There is always the riskof war arising out of misunderstanding or miscalculation. Moreover, out-side Europe we must expect instability to continue and perhaps increase.The emergence of many newly independent countries, especially in Africa,has been accompanied by unrest and armed conflict. These countries arerightly determined not to accept foreign domination ; but if our friends turn to us for help we must be ready to give it where we can, so that they mayachieve security and the chance to flourish in peace. In the Far East theChinese nuclear explosion casts a new shadow over the future, making it more difficult to forecast the trend of political development in an area where we have Commonwealth and treaty responsibilities to assist our friends.12. The Chinese explosion must remind us that the stability so farachieved in relations between Soviet and Western alliances might rapidly be jeopardised by the spread of nuclear weapons to countries which do not now possess them. For this reason international agreements to prevent the dissemination or acquisition of nuclear weapons must be an urgent aim ofour foreign policy. Our defence policy must encourage and not impede the achievement of such agreements. In the meantime our nuclear policy musthelp to provide some reassurance to non-nuclear powers.The Atlantic Nuclear Force13. The threat to Britain&apos;s survival can be met only by the strength andunity of the N.A.T.O. Alliance through which the United States, Canada,and the countries of Western Europe affirm their interdependence. Our aimin N.A.T.O. is to preserve peace by effectively deterring aggression, thuscreating the conditions for a further easing of tension and measures of disarmament, including arms control and a reduction of defence expendi-ture by both sides. The success of N.A.T.O. in achieving collective defencehas been a major cause of the growing stability in relations between Eastand West. The Alliance must maintain its strength and solidarity withoutundermining the opportunities for progress towards disarmament.14. It is with this need in view that Her Majesty&apos;s Government has pro-posed the formation of an Atlantic Nuclear Force in which strategic nuclear weapons available or to be made available to the Alliance would be subjectto collective authority. Thus the strategic nuclear power of N.A.T.O. wouldbe concentrated and controlled under conditions which would both meetthe legitimate requirements of the non-nuclear members to play their part and remove any incentive for the dissemination of nuclear weapons.732397 ; A 4
15. We have proposed that the Atlantic Nuclear Force should consistof the British V-bombers (except those required for commitments outsidethe N.A.T.O. area); a British squadron of four Polaris submarines nowunder construction ; at least an equal number of United States polaris submarines ; some kind of mixed-manned and jointly armed element orelements in which the existing non-nuclear powers could take; and anyforce which France may decide to subscribe. The British forces would be wholly committed for as long as the Alliance continued. The United States,the United Kingdom, and any other participating country which so wished,would have a veto over the release of the weapons of the Force. Proposalsfor the political control and military command of the Force have been madeto our allies.16. Our proposals for the Atlantic Nuclear Force imply a massiveBritish contribution to the Alliance, including a degree of interdependencehitherto unknown. We believe that their acceptance would bring a majorincrease in the strength and solidarity of the Alliance. They would supple-ment the existing arrangements by which we place under N.A.T.O. commandor make available to N.A.T.O. in an emergency a large part of our AirForce in the United Kingdom and the greater part of our naval forces, as wellas our land and air forces in Germany.The Land and Air Defence of Western Europe17. Our forces in Germany impose a heavy burden on our balance ofpayments. Within the framework of our Brussels Treaty commitments theymust always be subject to review in the light not only of our obligations to our N.A.T.O. partners but of our total defence burden and of the natureof the military threats in Europe and in other parts of the world where wehave responsibilities.18. At present all N.A.T.O. forces in Germany, including our own, aredeployed in accordance with a strategic concept which in our view nowrequires revision. In recent years the United States has developed an over-whelming nuclear strike force which is committed to the direct support of western Europe in case of war. Its purpose is to deter aggression. In theunlikely event that it should fail, its use would cause such destruction that it isimpossible to conceive of a land campaign in Europe lasting for many days.It is therefore pointless to tie up resources against the risk of a prolongedwar in Europe following the nuclear exchange. The principal military pur-pose of allied forces in Europe should be to deter miscalculated incursionsand to suppress any ambiguous and unpremeditated local conflicts first andforemost by conventional forces, before they can escalate into major war.Peace-keeping outside Europe19. Outside Europe we have treaty relations and commitments whichwe must honour. We maintain substantial forces for this reason and because we have a major interest in the stability of the world outside Europe, in its economic prosperity and in its peaceful development. These purposes weshare with our allies and our forces serve their interests as well as ours.Experience has shown that it is neither wise nor economical to use military force to seek to protect national economic interests in the modern world.
.Nor is it the purpose of our forces to hold oversea territory for Britain, as our record of decolonisation shows. In maintaining these interests in peace and stability, which our allies share with us the British contribution towardsmaintainiing them is paramount in many areas East of Suez. Here, as elsewhere, we have obligations to our Commonwealth and other allies ; and here we have facilities in our bases at Aden and Singapore. Our presence inthese areas forms in effect a substantial reinforcement for the peace-keepingrole of the United Nations.20. It would be politically irresponsible and economically wasteful if our bases were abandoned while they were still needed to promote peace in the areas concerned, though we recognise that they can be maintainedonly in agreement with the local governments and peoples. Our presence in these bases, our Commonwealth ties, and the mobility of our forces, per-mit us to make a contribution towards peace-keeping in vast areas of theworld where no other country is able to assume the same responsibility.21. In meeting this worldwide role we have a claim upon our alliessince we serve interests which are theirs as well as ours. If some of ourburdens can be assumed or shared by our allies, we may not need the full range of military power we should require to carry them all alone. We aim at a wider recognition of our common interests and at closer co-operationwith our allies in carrying out our tasks.Manpower22. At present our forces are severely streched both in manpower andin equipment. We are confident that we can generally attain the presentmanpower target of 180,000 for the Army, announced by our predecessorsin 1959, and the requirements of the Royal Air Force, though there may be difficulties in certain areas of officer recruitment and with some classes oftradesmen and specialists. In the Navy too few men, particularly in skilledtrades, are re-engaging for further service and although the rate of recruitmentis being maintained the numbers fall short of requirements, especially in theseaman category. Further steps to overcome these difficulties are underconsideration.23. The present review of commitments and roles, together with the continuing and intensive search for economy in the administrative and support fields may lead to manpower savings both within each Service andby the Services jointly. The need is for highly trained and versatile forces and for Reserves of the same high quality, organised for the requirements and priorities of the future. The current N.A.T.O. force planning exerciseis directly related to this problem.Equipment24. The rate at which the technological arms race is accelerating, and the readiness of the advanced countries to pass on to less-developed countriesweapons which are obsolescent in terms of great-power conflict, pose dauntingproblems in planning the equipment of British forces on a limited budget,particularly when many years may pass between the formulation of anoperational requirement and the appearance of the equipment in the field.25. The Government has multiple responsibilities here. If equipmentcosts are not to rise intolerably, it must forecast its military needs as
accurately as possible, ensuring that the sophistication of weapons is no greater than will be required, and that their numbers are related toprospective tasks. Having finally placed its order for a specific equipment,it must then ensure that costs are kept under control, that the equipment is delivered on time, and that it is reliable when in service.26. Given the political and technological uncertainties, a degree of erroris often inevitable. But the equipment programme inherited by the present government fails to satisfy either our military or our economic needs,particularly in the field of aircraft.Aircraft27. Jt has been necessary to take the whole of the Valiant bomber forceout of service several years before the planned date. British forces stillsuffer from a serious shortage of helicopters, and the reliability of someof those currently available has been unreasonably low. Some of themeasures undertaken to remedy this situation are outlined in part II.28. The programme undertaken by the last Administration for the replacement of the Hunter and for a new medium range transport aircraft were so costly as to impose an unacceptable burden on the Defence Budget,and the estimated delivery dates for these aircraft were such as to require an interim purchase of foreign aircraft if the Royal Air Force was notto become incapable of carrying out its tasks for a period of years. As already announced, the existing programmes have had to be cancelled and alternativeswill be ordered both from the United Kingdom and from the U.S.A. Thisdecision will secure savings of some  300m over the next ten years as well as providing the Royal Air Force with aircraft adequate to its needs at theright time.29. Additional advantages of this decision are that the Governmentremains free to decide the total size of its order for the alternative american aircraft when its defence review is complete, without increasing the unitcost of the aircraft if the size of the order is reduced, and that the Phantomaircraft of the Royal Air Force will be capable of operating from carriersat sea thus increasing the flexibility of the force and perhaps makingpossible a reduction in its size.30. A decision on the Canberra replacement is, as already announced,being deferred pending more precise establishment of requirements in thecourse of the current Defence Review and more accurate information on the costs of alternative aircraft. Meanwhile work on the TSR.2 is being continued.31. The Government recognises the importance to its defence policy,as well as to its domestic economy, of retaining the capacity in Britain forthe research, development and production of a military aircraft. Futureresearch and development programmes must be prepared so as to guaranteea capacity in this field, but at a cost the nation can afford. Among other,conditions, this will require that wherever possible the cost of research and development (this will apply to all weapons, and not only to aircraft)should be shared with other countries on terms which ensure Britain her fair share of the market for the weapons, or aircraft concerned, and that ifpossible operational requirements should be formulated with regard to the likely needs of potential customers abroad.   Among the possibilities here
under discussion with France is a proposal that we might together developan advanced trainer/strike aircraft incorporating variable geometry tomeet the needs of both countries.Cost Control32. Similar problems to those encountered concerning aircraft ariseover the whole field of sophisticated defence equipment. There is needfor further improvement in the existing machinery for relating requirements to costs and for the control of costs once orders are placed, if the nationis to get value for the money it spends on defence.33. Apart from other measures which are being taken to improve pro-cedure in the equipment field, there remains the area of time and costcontrol of major development projects. It is generally recognised thatthe problems involved here are among the hardest which have to be faced.Nevertheless, a determined attempt is being made, especially in the moresophisticated fields of development such as aircraft and guided weapons,to make improvements, for example, by the use of new techniques andchanged administrative arrangements. We have recently begun a pilotscheme of applying techniques of value analysis to certain equipments.Operational Requirements34. As part of the recent re-organisation of the Ministry of Defence,machinery has been set up for the closer examination of new requirements and of the progress of research and development. Requirements for newequipment are now considered by a unified Operational requirements committee and must be justified against the strategic concepts envisagedfor the period when the equipment will be in service. The sponsor mustdemonstrate that there is no duplication with other equipment and that given the resources available the method proposed is the best means ofcarrying out the task in question. The examination includes the cost-effectiveness of the proposed equipment.35. It has been decided to create an establishment at Byflect for defence operational analysis which, among other tasks, will participatecost-effectiveness studies for all three Services. The Director has recentlybeen appointed, and is now forming a nucleus of scientists, military per-sonnel and administrative staff for this work.Functional Costings36. These improvements in the machinery for judging the cost-effective-ness of alternative weapons-systems will provide an essential tool for producing a more economical defence programme over the period of yearsrequired before decisions can take effect. Another essential tool is thesystem of functional costings to which a high priority is now being given.37. In the last year much has been done towards introducing a functionalcostings (or programme element) system to assist in planning and co-ordinating the Defence Budget. The present form of long-term defencecosting, based on the Vote headings which provide the traditionalstructure for Estimates and Accounts, is of limited use for the planning of defence expenditure five or ten years ahead because the expectedfinancial resources are divided into categories of &quot; input&quot; expenditure 
pay, production, works and so forth rather than into categories of&quot; output &quot; in terms of the functions general purpose forces, support, reserves,etc. for which the resources are required. The fundamental problem here is how to reconcile strategic requirements with financial resources and theforces that, can be provided from them ; strategic requirements are defined in terms of the size of the forces and their capabilities.83. Functional costings portray defence expenditure in terms of &quot; output &quot;.Instead of Vote headings there are broad areas of expenditure, calledMajor Programmes, made up of many small items of expenditure. Thusexpenditure on the Army in B.A.O.R. and Berlin constitutes one of the major Programmes. This is subdivided so that, at the lowest level (theprogramme element) there is shown the cost of individual types of unit inGermany, such as infantry battalions and R.A. Regiments. The cost ofeach programme element includes the cost of its service personnel, the civilians directly employed in connection with it, and any new works services in progress for it, and other running costs. It is also practicable to identifyresearch and development expenditure relating to weapons and equipment and to show in broad terms how this expenditure contributes to the different parts of our forces. This makes far easier assembly and presentation ofinformation which has hitherto only been provided with difficulty in ad hoccostings of specific proposals.39. The first experiment in the functional costing system is now being studied, and the number of programme elements is likely to increase to morethan 600. It should then be possible to identify readily all the component parts of the long-term costings for ten years ahead, although especially inthe R. &amp; D. field the coverage of the second five years of the costings is less accurate. It is planned to use a computer for marshalling and sum-marising complex sets of figures recorded for the individual programmeelements. When the system is fully established those who plan the defence budget and have to decide on new projects for the defence programme willhave much more information than in the past about the relative costs ofplanned forces and weapons systems. The diagrams at Annex D give information on the basis of the Major Programmes.40. It is hoped that as far as security considerations allow it will become possible to supplement the information now given to Parliament aboutdefence expenditure by information in functional form. Estimates and accounts, however, will still be presented in Vote or &quot; input&quot; form because,apart from Parliamentary custom and the vast accounting changes requiredfor any change from the Vote system, the Vote form is an essential require-ment for the control of expenditure. Functional costings are essentially tool for planning. For this purpose it is not necessary for the figures to have the accuracy of an accounting document. Attributions of base and support costs, for example, often have to be made in broad terms. Theexistence of a functional costing covering the whole Defence Budget willmake it much easier to ensure that such problems are dealt with in a consistent manner.Control and Organisation41. The reorganisation of the Defence departments into a unified Ministryof Defence has been carried through successfully.   Responsibility for the
main aspects of defence policy, namely plans and operations, the defence programme and budget and the research and development programme, isnow concentrated within the new Department. The management of theindividual Services is delegated to the Admiralty, Army and Air ForceBoards, but there are very close links between policy and management.42. Unified control of policy and management has made it possible toconsider new initiatives for the rationalisation of Services&apos; administrationboth in the Ministry of Defence and in the field. The aim is the most efficient organisation for the support of the Services in peace and war inthe most economical way. The administrative and logistic systems ofthe three Services are, for the most part, now separate and differentlyorganised. Each has been designed over the years for the particular tasks,requirements and operational environments of a particular Service. Eachis large and highly complex. Any changes in the pattern of the supportorganisation must take full account of the differences in the needs and circumstances of the Services.43. Considerable progress has been made as described in Part 11, andthis will continue. But initially, at least, measures of reorganisation in thesecomplex administrative organisations are bound to be difficult and theirplanning is expensive in staff and otherwise. Nor is centralised controlof particular functions, with removal of direct management responsibilityfrom at least two of the three Services and their reliance on an agency,always the most efficient and economical arrangement. Each case must be carefully examined on merit.44. In order to lighten the burden which the new system imposes on theSecretary of State, and to ensure political supervision of the main functionsof the Ministry on an inter-Service basis, each of the senior Ministers underthe Secretary of State has been given a sphere of interest and concern acrossthe board in addition to his single-service responsibilities. Thus the deputy secretary of State as well as being Minister for the Army is specially con-cerned with matters of international policy relating to defence ; the Ministerfor the Royal Navy is concerned also with personnel and logistics in all three Services ; and the Minister for the Royal Air Force is concerned withco-ordination of research, development, and production for all three Servicesand the defence budget as a whole. It is not possible, however, for themto exercise executive responsibility in these fields as they do in themanagement of their own Services. The present division of responsibilities and interests among Ministers cannot therefore be more than an interim measure. The next step must depend upon larger changes in the structure of the Ministry as a whole.45. The creation of unified headquarters overseas and the progress of rationalisation must inevitably blur the line of single-Service management and create an automatic impetus towards new organisational arrangements.The question is not whether further changes take place, but what changes,in what direction and at what pace.46. If the future relationship between the Services and the Ministry ofDefence is not to develop hapazard, with the risk of dangerous confusion,it is necessary to examine more closely the longer term implications of
measures which are already in train. The whole structure of defence organisa-tion both in the Commands and in the Ministry of Defence itself is thereforebeing re-examined under the direction of the Deputy Secretary of State. Ourparamount concern must be for the operational needs of the forces in theafield, our aim to produce the most efficient fighting forces at the lowestcost. This study will start in the field and work backwards to Whitehall.It will be free to consider any form of organisation which seems appropriate to the achievement of the aim.47. In order to maintain the necessary impetus towards a more efficient and economical administration of the existing organisation it is proposedto establish a special committee of the Defence Council under the chair-manship of the Deputy Secretary of State for Defence.Defence Costs48. The defence budget estimates for 1965-66 now presented total 2,1205m. This represents an increase in real terms of 2-3 per cent, overlast year&apos;s estimates. The estimates do not include provision for cancellation-tion payments in respect of aircraft projects which have been discontinued.Supplementary estimates for these will be presented in due course.
PART IITHE DEFENCE FORCESDEPLOYMENTGeneral Pattern49. The basic principle of our deployment is to retain in overseas theatresthe minimum forces consistent with our commitments and to hold ready inthe United Kingdom a Strategic Reserve, together with the air transportnecessary to reinforce at maximum speed to any part of the world. In con-sequence the broad division between men (U.K. adult males) based on thiscountry and men based overseas (including Germany) is as follows :East of Suez............      58,000 sPlus 14,000 GurkhasElsewhere     ............       9,000Our total contribution in the Malaysian theatre including Gurkhas is nowover 50,000.United Kingdom50. The Strategic Reserve is a highly mobile, airportable force capableof undertaking operations in any part of the world ; it can be drawn upon for reinforcement world-wide. R.A.F. Transport Command in the U.K.is ready to provide airlift of men and equipment on behalf of all three services and reinforce the tactical Transport forces overseas.51. Other air forces in the United Kingdom include Bomber Command,Fighter Command and Coastal Command, which like our naval forces, haveN.A.T.O. commitments but are also available for overseas reinforcement.Apart from its nuclear role Bomber Command provides a major strikecapability with conventional weapons and with a capacity for rapid move-ment world-wide at short notice.52. Naval forces based on the United Kingdom at present include an air-craft carrier, cruisers, guided missile destroyers, escorts, submarines andsmaller craft.53. In addition to these operational forces, we maintain in the UnitedKingdom the principal administrative, training, technical and support facilitiesfor all three Services.United KingdomGermany (including Berlin)Mediterranean240,00062,00023,000392,000plus 14,000 Gurkhas
Germany54. Under the amended Brussels Treaty, we have a commitment to keepon the continent of Europe 55,000 men in the Army and a Tactical Air Force.We also have a commitment to N.A.T.O. to maintain forces there. Inthe event of an acute overseas emergency we are able to withdraw forces fromGermany temporarily. To this extent, the units there can be regarded, within limits, as part of our reserve.55. At present, against our commitment of 55,000 soldiers, we have about51,000. In addition there are in Germany Canberra strike and reconnaissancesquadrons, Hunter fighter-reconnaissance aircraft, Javelin fighters (which willbe replaced by Lightnings in the course of 1965) and Wessex 2 helicopters.The R.A.F. strength in Germany is 8,700 men.Mediterranean56. In the Mediterranean we have escort vessels, submarines andsome minesweepers ; small Army garrisons at Gibraltar and Malta ; and twomaritime and one photographic-reconnaissance squadron. The naval andair forces are principally deployed in support of N.A.T.O. In Libya, thefuture of our forces is under review with the Libyan Government under theterms of the Anglo-Libyan Treaty.57. In Cyprus, we normally maintain an Army garrison with supportingtroops in addition to the important R.A.F. base at Akrotiri and R.A.F.contingent at Nicosia. At present we have in addition 1,000 men serving with the U.N. Force. R.A.F. units in Cyprus include Canberra bomber squadrons for the support of C.E.N.T.O., these having a nuclear as wellas a conventional capacity.Middle East58. Aden is the base for a Royal Marine Commando, Army units andR.A.F. ground attack and air defence, reconnaissance and transportsquadrons. At Bahrein in the Persian Gulf there is an Army detachment.The R.A.F. maintain a presence in the Gulf. Naval units on the middle east station, with base facilities at Bahrein and Aden, include escorts, theamphibious warfare squadron and minesweepers. Carrier and Commandoships cover the whole area East of Suez.59. One infantry battalion is stationed in Swaziland for internal security duties in the three British Protectorates.Far East60. Our largest forces outside Europe are in the Far East, where we havea combined commitment to S.E.A.T.O. and to Malaysia. The deployment of aircraft carriers and Commando ships is flexible as between the middle east and Far East and we expect to maintain a total of three in the area east of Suez. In the Far East in addition there are guided missile destroyers and a large number of escorts, submarines and coastal minesweepers. TheArmy has substantial forces engaged in the Borneo operations, and inaddition contributes units and individuals to 28 Commonwealth brigade group which is permanently stationed in Western Malaysia: this Brigadehas units from the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand and mainlyintegrated supporting arms and services including Scout helicopters.  R.A.F.
units permanently deployed in the Far East include Canberra bombers and reconnaissance aircraft, Hunter ground attack aircraft, Shackleton maritimepatrol aircraft, Hastings, Beverley and Argosy transport aircraft, Whirl-wind and Belvedere helicopters, and Javelin fighters. In 1964 a BloodhoundII squadron was deployed to Singapore. Whirlwinds of the Far East AirForce and R.N. Wessex helicopters have been fitted with SS11 wire guided missiles. We also maintain a military force in Hong Kong.Other Areas61. There is a military force in British Guiana ; escort vessels and smallground forces in the Caribbean ; and small naval forces in the South Atlanticor on loan to Australia and Canada.Command Organisation Oversea62. Operational control of our forces deployed in the two major theatresEast of Suez the Middle East and Far East is exercised through unified command Headquarters, and responsibility for the command of all british forces allocated to the area and the planning and conduct of all operations is vested in a single Commander, who may belong to any of the three Services. Toenable him to discharge his responsibilities the Commander-in-Chief is sup-ported by an inter-Service staff which is co-ordinated by a Chief of Staff.Thus staff work in the fields of operational and administrative planning, of intelligence and of signals is carried out on a unified basis. The Com-mander in Chief is also responsible for the oversight and co-ordination ofadministration and finance to the extent necessary to ensure the most effective functioning and efficiency of his command. These arrangements are one of the most important features of the increasing unity of the Services.operations and trainingCyprus63. British forces have shared the peace-keeping role in Cyprus sincetrouble broke out in December 1963. At first they took part in a jointpeace-keeping force of the British permanent garrison from the SovereignBase areas with Greek and Turkish contingents in Cyprus, and in january and February 1964 Headquarters 3 Division with its signal regiment, sixmajor units, and three armoured car squadrons was flown to Cyprus byR.A.F. Transport Command with reinforcements of administrative personnel.64. This peace-keeping force was superseded at the end of March 1964by the United Nations Force in Cyprus. The British Army contributesabout a thousand men, including one infantry battalion, one armoured carsquadron and a large part of the force headquarters. Throughout theoperation Headquarters Cyprus District and the administrative units withinthe Sovereign Base areas have provided all the logistic support for the united nations Force. The R.A.F. contribution includes helicopters.65. In November 1964 Her Majesty&apos;s Government agreed, at the requestof the Secretary-General of the United Nations, to provide air lift, free of charge, for the rotation of the Danish contingent. Britannias of transport command carried 1,700 Danish troops, with equipment. It was made clearthat, in view of our other contributions to the Force, this was a service that could not be repeated on the same terms.1732397 ; A 5
South Arabian Federation66. In 1964 there was an armed insurrection by tribesmen in the Radfanwith active support from the Yemen. It became necessary at the requestof the Radfan Government to mount an operation to restore law and orderin the area, and to despatch reinforcements from the United Kingdom. InMay Transport Command flew out to Aden the 1st Battalion the King&apos;sOwn Scottish Borderers, H.Q. 39 Brigade, 1st Battalion The Royal Scotsand the 3rd Independent Field Squadron Royal Engineers. The Army, theRoyal Marines and Federal Regular Army all provided strong detachments inthe operational area, and despite the extremely rugged nature of the Radfanthe British troops fighting with the Federal Regular Army soon showed thatthey could move freely throughout the area. The R.A.F. Regiment squadron in Aden also took part in the operations.67. Throughout the operation ground troops were supported by aircraft of the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy. Canberras and Hunters carried outreconnaissance sorties, and Hunter ground attack aircraft provided close support for the forward troops, attacking rebel strongholds in the mountains.When H.M.S. Centaur returned to the Aden area in June, Sea Vixens joined the Royal Air Force in the air strikes.68. Helicopters and light aircraft of the Royal Air Force, the Royal Navy,and the Army gave continuous support to the ground forces and movedtroops as well as large quantities of food, water and ammunition. The mainoperations came to an end in October 1964, by which time most of theRadfan tribes had ceased hostilities. Activity by the dissidents still con-tinues in various parts of the Federation and it is known that every effort is being made by those who are behind them to promote the spread ofdisaffection by stock-piling arms and recruiting more rebel forces.Far East69. The main task of the Services in the Far East during 1964 has beenoperations in support of Malaysia. Operations in Eastern Malaysia (Sabahand Sarawak) have consisted mainly of extensive patrolling of the 1,000-mile frontier with Indonesia. A number of British and Gurkha battalions and two Royal Marine Commandos have been engaged in operations there,and there have been numerous clashes, in which a number of British andGurkha officers and men have been killed and wounded, and many casualtiesinflicted on the Indonesian raiders. The R.A.F. Regiment has also operated in Eastern Malaysia, both on the ground and in helicopters. Throughoutthe year Whirlwind Wessex 1 and Belvedere helicopters of the Royal AirForce and the Royal Navy have been based on Sabah and Sarawak and increased the mobility of the Army and the Royal Marines.70. At sea H.M. ships and craft manned by officers and men of theRoyal Navy have patrolled the coastal and inland waters of Eastern malaysia and R.A.F. Shackletons have undertaken coastal patrols. These patrolshave had success against infiltrators from Indonesia and are a deterrent to increased activity. H.M. ships and R.A.F. aircraft have carried very sub-stantial numbers of passengers and amounts of freight, as well as vehicles and light aircraft, from Singapore to Eastern Malaysia. In addition to thehelicopters, R.A.F. Twin Pioneers provided tactical and transport support for the ground forces operating in the forward areas.
71. These operations have successfully contained the threat to EasternMalaysia. They have notably demonstrated the value of inter-Serviceco-operation, and the value of and the need for more helicopters.72. On the Malayan mainland Gurkha and Commonwealth troops havetaken part in mopping-up operations and H.M. ships have carried outanti-infiltration patrols in the Malacca straits. After the Indonesian landingsin September the theatre forces were quickly reinforced by four escorts andby detachments of V-bombers, Canberras, Shackletons and Javelins. Themain value of these reinforcements, particularly of aircraft, has been as a deterrent, but reconnaissance operations have also been undertaken to locatethe invaders, and.Hunters carried out air strikes in support of the ground forces.   The role of the Javelins is the air defence of Malaya.73. Air transport, reconnaissance, and casualty evacuation missions havebeen flown by Valettas, Canberras and Sycamores.East Africa74. Early in 1964 there were mutinies in local forces in East Africa and commonwealth Governments sought the assistance of the British Govern-ment. There was an immediate response from British forces; two infantry battalions and one light regiment were already stationed in Kenya, 45Commando was embarked in H.M.S. Centaur in East African waters and41 Commando was despatched from the United Kingdom.75. In Kenya the 3rd Light Regiment Royal Horse Artillery dealt witha Kenya Army mutiny, and the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards covered possibletrouble in the Nairobi area. Shackletons and Canberra reconnaissance air-craft, as well as Hunters, were deployed to Kenya, and 38 R.A.F. Regimentfield squadron from Aden also took part in the Kenya operations. Mediumrange transport aircraft of the Middle East Air Force took other Armyunits to Kenya and Uganda. The Uganda mutiny was contained by the1st Battalion The Staffordshire Regiment with one company 2nd BattalionScots Guards under command.76. In Tanganyika H.M.S. Centaur, supported by H.M.S. Cambrian,landed 45 Commando with a large amount of stores and ammunition withina few hours of the Presidents call for assistance; order was quicklyre-established. Subsequently 41 Commando with vehicles and freight was flown to Nairobi by Britannias of R.A.F. Transport Command and went toTanganyika to relieve 45 Commando R.M. H.M.S. Centaur was relieved by H.M.S. Victorious and H.M.S. Bulwark arrived from the Far East insupport. Throughout the operation Wessex helicopters from the squadronson board the carriers acted in support and R.A.F. Belvedere helicoptersassisted in the landings. Sea Vixen aircraft also supported the royal marines. Off the coast of Tanganyika H.M.S. Owen and the Royal FleetAuxiliary Hebe evacuated British subjects from Zanzibar.77. Since December 1963 British Army and R.A.F. units have providedlogistic support for Kenya security forces in their emergency operations inthe North East of Kenya. R.A.F. Beverley and Twin Pioneer aircraft,Army Air Corps Beavers and Alouettes, 34 Field Squadron royal engineers, and 16 Air Despatch Company, Royal Army Service Corps,have given most of this support.
British Guiana78. In British Guiana law and order could not have been maintainedwithout the presence of British troops, since the police were not strong enough to contain a highly explosive situation ; British troops helped withpatrols and searches. In May 1964 the garrison was reinforced by 1stBattalion Devon and Dorset Regiment which was flown out by transport command ; later a battery of 20 Medium Regiment R.A. (in an infantryrole) was flown out and a Royal Marines detachment from H.M.S. Whirlwindwas landed. Once again helicopters of all three Services made possible the rapid deployment of patrols to troubled areas; a combined force of Armyand R.A.F. helicopters has been established to help in operations.Inter-Allied Exercises79. In addition to taking part in active operations in theatres our forces have participated in a large number of inter-allied exercises under the auspices of the three regional alliances. All three Services have taken partin N.A.T.O. training exercises including one carried out by the allied command Europe Mobile Force in Norway in which Javelins of R.A.F.Germany also took part. In the N.A.T.O. exercise Teamwork, Saclant&apos;smajor four yearly exercise, forces from all the N.A.T.O. countries took partincluding ships from the Royal Navy and aircraft from Bomber, fighter and Coastal Commands. In the annual Airccnt reconnaissance competitionNo. 80 Canberra Squadron, R.A.F. Germany, won the award for the premiersquadron in 2nd Allied Tactical Air Force.80. The annual C.E.N.T.O. exercise Midlink again took place in theIndian Ocean ; 3 escorts, 1 submarine and 4 coastal minesweepers, and4 Shackletons took part. Australian, Canadian, Indian, Malaysian, NewZealand and U.K. forces co-operated in the large scale maritime exerciseJet 64 in the Indian Ocean from 29th February to 21st March. In AprilCanberras, Hunters and transport aircraft took part in a tactical air exerciseheld in Thailand in which elements of Far East Land Forces were also concerned. In May and June ships of the Royal Navy, and Shackletonsand Canberras took part in an amphibious and airborne exercise on the island of Mindoro in the Philippines.Fishery protection81. Closely akin to operations has been fishery protection work around the United Kingdom. Home fishery limits were extended in September 1964,and fishery protection work was carried out not only by the ships of the fishery Protection Squadron but also, from time to time, by R.A.F. helicopters-copters and Shackletons of Coastal Command.Goodwill Visits82. H.M. ships continued to visit ports all over the world to show theflag. A special squadron visited certain South American countries and therehave been visits to Trade Fairs. In September 1964, H.M.S. Lion and fourescorts with 3 Shackletons, 9 Canberras, 8 Javelins, 2 Hunters and 1 Vulcantook part in the Independence celebrations in Malta. R.A.F. aircraft includ-ing V aircraft have also flown to visit foreign countries.
Aero-medical Service83. The R.A.F. has continued to provide regular aero-medical service from Germany, Cyprus, Aden and Singapore. During 1964 there were 342flights.Help to Civil Authorities84. The Services have also provided emergency assistance to civil authori-ties in many parts of the world on many occasions. The British forces gaveswift help after Typhoon Ruby struck Hong Kong ; after the recent cyclonein Ceylon ; and in the South Arabian Federation, where severe flooding inLower Aulaqi caused a local economic and agricultural disaster, the Armycarried out much urgent reconstruction work using plant flown in by theRoyal Air Force.85. In the United Kingdom the forces have helped in a variety of civilemergencies. There have been extensive search and rescue operations;during 1964 R.A.F. aircraft, helicopters, mountain rescue teams and marinecraft were involved in 508 search and rescue operations in and around theU.K.; in all 276 people were rescued.Joint-Service Training ; Training with the Commonwealth and Allies86. Throughout 1964 the emphasis on joint Service and inter-Allied train-ing has continued. For example Transport Command took part in 155exercises involving all three Services. New developments, such as thecoming into service of the new Assault and Logistic ships, and the newgeneration of transport aircraft, will further this process.87. Joint training has been carried out in Germany, Denmark, Norway,Canada, Libya, Cyprus, Aden, Kenya, Singapore, the West Indies and NewZealand. There have been a number of Army exercises in Italy, Holland and denmark. Overseas camps have again been held for Royal Military AcademySandhurst in Germany and Libya. The Reserve Army has taken part in over-seas exercises, including one in which 3,000 members of the Territorial Army,Territorial Army Emergency Reserve and Army Emergency Reserve practisedmobilisation procedures and trained in the British Army of The Rhine. TheTerritorial Army Emergency Reserve practised two smaller exercises in aden. Tanker aircraft of Bomber Command have taken part in flightrefuelling exercises in which fighters and tankers practised rapid deploymentto the Near and Far East, and in 1964 the first Lightning refuelling exerciseto the Persian Gulf took place. Individual V-bombers have made over 500overseas training flights, and a number of V-bombers recently flew to Darwinto exercise with the Royal Australian Air Force.88. Training facilities have been provided in the United Kingdom for german and Belgian forces, and a Danish battalion will be exercising inthis country in March 1965 in exchange with a British unit. Ships from anumber of countries including Canada and the U.S.A. have continued to visitLondonderry for joint anti-submarine exercises.89. In 1965 some 530 Commonwealth officers and men will undergotraining in the United Kingdom, and some 600 officers and 800 men of all three Services will be assisting in the training of Commonwealth forces over-seas.   There is also continued cooperation in flying training with the
Commonwealth and other countries as well as between the Services them-selves. All Naval pilots receive their basic flying training at R.A.F. Linton-on-Ouse and Army personnel are given parachute training at R.A.F.Abingdon. From the Commonwealth and elsewhere abroad 780 officers andmen from thirty countries undertook flying or technical training at R.A.F.establishments.PERSONNEL90. The strength of the Royal Navy increased from 89,146 adult maleson 1st January, 1964 to 91,078 on 1st January, 1965 and is expected tohave increased to 93,550 by April 1966.91. The strength of the Army rose during 1964 from 170,678 adultmales to 175,991 (including 1,429 Young Soldiers) and the deficiencyagainst the planned target of 180,000 was reduced to 2-2 percent.92. Progressive reductions are taking place in the establishment of theRoyal Air Force and the adult male strength fell from 127,276 to 123,051during the year.OfficersEntries to Dartmouth, Sandhurst, Cranwell and Henlow93. 229 cadets entered the Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouthlast September, compared with 171 in 1962 and 198 in 1963. 134 of thecadets had held R.N. scholarships or reserved cadetships, the balance of95 entered through the 1964 direct entry cadetship competition. This isthe first year since 1957 that the requirement has been fully met; theincrease was partly attributable to a larger number of candidates underthe Scholarship Scheme. However, there was a very slight drop in thenumber of candidates applying for direct entry, and although 78 R.N. andR.M. scholarships, and 142 R.N. reserved cadetships were awarded in 1964,considerably fewer candidates are now applying for awards under the nextcompetition ; 49 candidates who failed to qualify for the General List acceptedappointments on the Supplementary Lists.94. The number of United Kingdom cadets entering the Royal MilitaryAcademy, Sandhurst, in 1964 was 448 compared with 402 in 1963. Boththe January and September entries were fully subscribed. Applications forWelbeck College increased considerably, more coming from Scotland andthe North of England. Under the Army Scholarship Scheme, which hasoperated since 1959, 73 candidates have so far graduated from Sandhurst.95. In 1964 recruiting for Cranwell the entry requirements were fullymet. A total of 125 cadets entered compared with 116 in 1963 and 105 in1962. Recruiting for Henlow has also been good in 1964 with 47 entrantsagainst a target of 48. The Scholarship Scheme continued to attract appli-cations from a large number of boys from all types of school, and there wasno difficulty in selecting the full annual quota of 75 for these awards.Royal Marines96. The Royal Marines continue to obtain all the General List officersrequired through the direct entry competitions, the Scholarships scheme andCorps Commission promotions.   There is also very keen competition for
the Short Service Commissions entry which was introduced this year. Anadditional number of Royal Marines officers is being enlisted next year for duty as helicopter pilots. The Civil Service Commissioners EntranceExamination is being discontinued and new entrants for the General Listwill have to qualify by obtaining five G.C.E. passes including two at AdvancedLevel.Other CommissionsRoyal Navy97. Supplementary List. The number of Seaman Officer entries to the supplementary List continues to be satisfactory, but there are still difficultiesin obtaining officers for both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopter pilot duties.The shortage is increased by the number of Aircrew officers on the Supplc-mentary List who are exercising their option to leave the Service at break-points during their commission. 210 applications were received for theR.N. Flying Scholarships introduced for the first time in 1964 and 68 awardsmade ; next year it is hoped to award up to 100 scholarships. From nextyear also, a Supplementary List scheme of entry for professionally qualifiedMechanical Engineers will be introduced, similar to the existing scheme forqualified Electrical Engineers.98. Instructor: Medical: Dental: Chaplains Branches. In the InstructorBranch the requirement for 68 officers was met, including 50 graduates,mainly in the sciences. The Medical Branch still requires more qualifieddoctors, and it is hoped to increase the number of awards made under themedical scheme. Dental Branch entries were sufficient. The ChaplainsDepartment is at present having some difficulty in obtaining sufficient recruits.Army99. Applications for Short Service Commissions for the Army continueto fall short of requirements: 200 were granted in 1964 compared with207 in 1963. Under the Limited Service Regular Commission scheme intro-duced during 1964, 10 commissions have been granted, and 16 applicantsare undergoing training at Mons Officer Cadet School.100. Progress is being made with the reorganisation of the Royal ArmyMedical Corps by which three types of non-Medical Officer Administrative,Technical and Quartermaster are being established. Fourteen Technicianshave been commissioned as Technical Officers. The administrative type of commission will be introduced on 1st April, 1965.Royal Air Force101. It is becoming more difficult to recruit Direct Entry Aircrew.Although the flying training schools are still working to capacity, the num-bers of recruits have started to fall slightly below the requirement; adver-advertising has therefore been increased. Recruiting for ground branches was generally satisfactory, but some branches still need qualified entrants,especially the Technical Branch, which faces constant competition with industry for professionally qualified men and women; the Medical Branch ;and the Education Branch where W.R.A.F. officers are urgently needed.
University Graduate Entrants and University Training Schemes102. The response to the new graduate entry in the Royal Navy for theSeaman specialisation and existing entry to the Engineering (Mechanical)Specialisation of the General List was a little disappointing, and a Univer-,sity Cadetship scheme is being introduced for entry into the Seaman and engineering specialisations. In addition, a Reserved Place Scheme forgraduate candidates for R.N. engineering commissions is being introduced.A scheme for entering electrical engineering graduates is being reintroduced.103. There has been an increase in the interest shown by Universitystudents in the Army since the appointment of a University Liaison officer in 1963. During 1964 29 (including 2 short service) University candidateswere commissioned into the Regiments and Corps which receive officers from Sandhurst, compared with 18 in 1963. A scheme was introduced forup to 20 young men from civilian life to be granted regular commissionson probation and to study for science or engineering degrees, half of them at the Royal Military College of Science and the remainder at universitiesat which they have gained a place.104. The R.A.F. University Cadetship Scheme for the General duties and Technical Branches has proved successful both in the numbers and quality of applicants. In the first year, 1963, 23 awards were made, against a target of about 25, and in view of the increasing need for graduates in thesebranches, 44 awards were made in 1964. The R.A.F. Medical and DentalCadetships, which have been running for some years, are now firmly estab-lished. In addition to officers entering the R.A.F. through the variousuniversity cadetship schemes, the recruitment of other graduates was good ;80 men and 12 women graduates were appointed to commissions, excludingdoctors, dentists, and chaplains.Officers Training Corps and University Air Squadrons105. The strength of the Officers Training Corps has remained at about75 per cent, of establishment. One new University sub-unit affiliated to an existing contingent has been started. An improvement in recruiting is expectedas a result of a new scheme for attaching officer cadets to regular unitsoverseas.106. University Air Squadron facilities were extended to five more universities-ties during 1964 Sheffield, Leicester, Keele, York and Strathclyde. The 18squadrons now serve 24 universities. Besides providing a most valuableassociation between Universities and the R.A.F., the Squadrons continue toprovide recruits of high quality.Officer Training and Degree Courses107. In addition to comprehensive professional and academic training,there are opportunities for officers of all three Services to follow degree and post graduate courses at Service colleges and elsewhere. Officers of the royal navy can now take degree and diploma courses in engineering and postgraduate scientific courses at the R.N. colleges at Manadon and Greenwich.Courses in atomic physics and nuclear propulsion are held at Greenwich for naval and civilian personnel; and the College provides professional courses for Naval architects and electrical and mechanical engineers. There are alsoschemes for sending Naval officers to universities ; the latest is for seamen and Supply Officers and the first four officers under this scheme have
been accepted for Oxford this year. Army officers read for degrees at universities as well as at the Royal Military College of Science at Shriven-ham and now go to a wider range of universities ; a new scheme has been introduced for up to twenty short Service Commission Officers a year to study for science and engineering degrees at Shrivenham. There are now168 Army officers reading for such degrees, and 29 reading for arts degrees.After the amalgamation at Cranwell later this year of the functions of theRoyal Air Force College Cranwell and the Royal Air Force TechnicalCollege Henlow of cadet training, together with initial and post graduatetraining of R.A.F. Technical Officers, will be undertaken at Cranwell ; andthe present arrangements under which technical cadets study for a Diplomain Technology or a higher national diploma in either electrical or mechanicalengineering will continue. R.A.F. officers undertake post graduate courseselsewhere, for example at Southampton University and the College of Aero-nautics, Cranfield.Staff Colleges108. An important element of joint training has always been undertaken at the Imperial Defence College and the Joint Services Staff College. TheService Staff Colleges now devote over 20 per cent, of their syllabuses tojoint staff training. Many places at the Staff Colleges are taken by Common-wealth and foreign students.Ratings, Soldiers and AirmenRoyal Navy and Royal Marines109. Recruitment. For several years the R.N. and R.M. have beenrecruiting rather less than 8,000 a year (except for a few months in the winter of 1962-63). But to achieve the expansion indicated above, it will benecessary (unless there is a marked improvement in the rate of re-engagement)to recruit in the next few years at a rate of over 9,000.110. There are signs, however, that it will be difficult to improve beyond separately of 8,000. Nearly three-quarters of rating recruits are young men under174- years of age. The numbers will decrease, now that the population bulgehas moved into higher ages. In view of this, intensive efforts have beenmade to publicise the attractions of a naval career, and the careers organisa-tion has been strengthened.111. Re-engagement. The rate of re-engagement has been steadily falling.The proportion of R.N. ratings re-engaging on completion of 12-yearengagements, for example, for the first nine months of 1964 was about 52 percent, as against 54 per cent, in 1963 and 65 per cent, in 1959. The effect ofthe fall in re-engagements is particularly felt in certain skilled categories. the trend is largely attributable to the separation from home associated withnaval service, which has been accentuated by the increase in the size of theFleet serving in the Far East.Army112. The past year has shown a welcome improvement over 1963. Recruit-ing publicity has continued to rely strongly on the personal testimony of serving soldiers. The Army Youth Teams have proved successful, particularlyin dispelling the false image of Army life among those who have no acqain-tance with the modern Army.
113. Recruiting was also stimulated by the introduction with effect from 1st April, 1964 of the &quot; Young Soldier &quot; scheme, under which young men aged were allowed to enlist with their parents&apos; consent. This measureclosed the gap between the maximum age for enlistment as a boy, and theminimum age for enlistment as an adult 4,488 young soldiers aged&quot;were enlisted up to the end of 1964 representing 25 per cent, of all enlistmentsfrom 1st April 1964.114. An encouraging feature of recruiting was the high proportion,5IT per cent., of men enlisting on an initial engagement of nine years. Thisshould help to provide increased stability in the Army of the future.115. Normal run-out at the end of the soldiers&apos; terms of service during1964 amounted to 9,225 compared with 6,186 in 1963, and 5,635 in 1962.This higher number is mainly due to the large number of men who enlistedin 1958 on the minimum six-year initial engagement introduced in October1957, and who completed their terms of service in 1964. Wastage was13,735 compared with 13,342 in 1963, and 12,946 in 1962.116. As the target strength of about 160,000 soldiers is approached the achievement of a proper balance between the various corps and tradesbecomes increasingly important. Efforts are being made to achieve thisbalance without imposing restrictions on the recruitment of any men ofthe right quality who wish to join the Army. The main proportionateshortfall against requirements arises in certain brigades of the infantry and in the R.A.M.C. and R.A.D.C. Even when the overall target isattained difficult problems will remain not only in maintaining the Army&apos;sstrength but in building up the required numbers in each Corps, tradeand skill.117. The recruitment of boys has continued successfully. At the endof 1964 including those serving on adult engagements there were 4,170apprentices, 4,301 junior leaders, 1,615 junior tradesmen and 1,515 juniorbandsmen under training, a total of 11,601. The Junior Army association was introduced during the year with the aim of retaining the interests in theArmy of the many boys for whom it is not possible to allot vacancies in oneof the junior soldier units. These boys are given their own badge and arekept in touch with the Army in a variety of ways. It is hoped that many ofthem will join the Army when they reach the age of 17.Royal Air Force118. The number of adult vacancies in the R.A.F. Ground Trades con-tinued to be very low until the beginning of July 1964 when normalrecruiting was resumed. The new requirements are being generally metexcept in certain categories notably Trade Assistant General, Steward and nursing Attendant. Young men aged between 17 and 174- years may now be recruited with their parents&apos; consent for R.A.F. service. These&quot; young airmen&quot; are accommodated and trained in the same way asrecruits over 174- but are not posted from training until reaching that age.119. The new Youth Entry Scheme was successfully launched in September1964. The high quality of the Youth Entry has been maintained and the requirement for Craft and Administrative Apprentices has been substantiallymet. The first intake of Technician Apprentices came to within 80 per cent.
-   1of the requirement; and, as this was the first entry of these well qualifiedboys (4 G.C.E.&apos;s at &quot; O&quot; level including mathematics and a sciencesubject) it was satisfactory.Training of Ratings, Other Ranks and Airmen120. In all three Services the technical training given to junior personnelthough designed for Service purposes provides wherever possible for the attainment of nationally recognised qualifications and experience whichwill be valuable later in civilian life. Some courses for junior personnellead to the Ordinary National Certificate, others to City and Guilds qualifica-tions, and there are opportunities to read for G.C.E. (O) level. Com-pletion of many Service technical courses followed by experience in the-trade is recognised by Trade Unions as a qualification for membership on leaving the Services. Dockyard Technical Colleges provide courses for civilian dockyard apprentices leading to O.N.C. and H.N.C. and to city and Guilds qualifications.Women&apos;s Services121. The authorised number of 250 W.R.N.S. officers has been maintainedwith a satisfactory balance between promoted ratings and direct entries.122. In order to maintain a strength of about 3,000 W.R.N.S. ratingssome 1,000 enrolments are needed each year. The minimum age has beenlowered from ill to 17, and the intake in 1964 was 963.123. The W.R.A.C. serve with all major Arms and Services in 28different trades and employments. 25 per cent, of the Q.A.R.A.N.C. andW.R.A.C. are stationed abroad. Both of these Corps require more officers,although the officer strength of the Q.A.R.A.N.C. increased during 1964from 700 to 720, and the officer strength of the W.R.A.C. from 281 to 301.The other rank strength of the Q.A.R.A.N.C. fell from 909 to 899 andthe other rank strength of the W.R.A.C. fell from 4,682 to 4,639.124. As the size of the Royal Air Force has reduced, so have the numbersof W.R.A.F. personnel fallen during the year from 446 officers and 5,411airwomen to 438 officers and 4,585 airwomen. Recruiting has been generally satisfactory. The W.R.A.F. serve in a wide variety of posts both at homeand overseas. During the year the strength of the Princess Mary&apos;s RoyalAir Force Nursing Service rose from 390 officers to 410.125. The three Services all need more women to serve longer than thenormal initial engagement. As an inducement to longer service, schemes were introduced towards the end of 1964 for bonus payments to new entrants who undertake to serve for six years and who do so, and forsmaller bonuses to women already serving who undertake and completetwo years&apos; extra service.Reserve and Auxiliary forces royal Naval Reserve/Royal Fleet Reserve126. Estimates provision has been made for a Royal Naval Reservestrength of about 4,000 officers and 4,200 ratings. For the Royal MarineForces Volunteer Reserve, the figures are 150 officers and 920 other ranks &apos;,for the Women&apos;s Royal Naval Reserve, 160 and 925.   Numbers of officers
are also enrolled in the Royal Naval Volunteer Supplementary Reserve,but these have no training commitment. Apart from the latter, all the reserves have carried out normal training in 1964-65, including periods inH.M. ships.127. A scheme initiated in 1962 whereby medical and dental students and pre-registration doctors enter the R.N.R. with a view to acceptingR.N. Short Service or Permanent commissions after registration has attracted28 medical and 8 dental officers so far.128. Although the number of men committed to service in the RoyalFleet Reserve following active service is reducing temporarily, the fall in strength is being countered by voluntary re-engagement and enrolment in theReserve of ex-regular sailors with no Reserve liability.Army Reserves129. A preliminary examination of the availability of Reserve forceshas indicated that a large part of the Reserves cannot be utilised except under restrictive and archaic conditions. Though there has been recentlegislation on the Reserves the essential difficulty of matching the liabilities of Reservists against the operational requirement has been left unresolved.This failure to grapple with this problem leaves open the possibility of serious prejudice to our capacity to deploy the necessary forces at theright time. When the review of roles and commitments of the forces as a whole is completed it is intended to bring forward legislative proposalsaimed at securing the maximum availability of Reserves consistent withthe operational need.Territorial Army130. The Territorial Army is now at about 90 per cent, of its peacetimeceiling and is maintaining itself at that level. During 1965 detachmentsof volunteers totalling about 7,000 men from a wide range of T.A. units will carry out their annual camp training with the regular army in North-West Europe. Steady progress is also being made in providing modern equipment for the Territorial Army.131. There has been an increase in the number of men volunteeringfor the Territorial Army Emergency Reserve, which has now reached a strength of some 6,600 all ranks. The role of the force will be reconsideredas part of the Home Defence Review mentioned in Part III.Army Emergency Reserve132. Category I of the Army Emergency Reserve, intended to providebacking for the strategic reserve in a limited war, is now recruited to over80 per cent, of establishment.133. There is still a need to recruit more men for Category II. this category provides certain specialists required for general war ; it involves no pre-proclamation liability for service overseas.Royal Auxiliary Air Force134. The Royal Auxiliary Air Force now consists of Maritime Head-quarter Units which have the task of reinforcing the operational control organisation of Coastal Command in emergency.
The Navy, Army and Air Force Reserves Act 1964135. The provisions of the Navy, Army and Air Force Reserves Act1954 were extended by the 1964 Act to 30th June, 1969, but its main effect has been to release a million or so men who had completed their periodof National Service in 1962 or earlier, from all Reserve obligations.Cadet Forces136. The Combined Cadet Force has been reorganised and reduced to amaximum of 56,500 cadets made up as follows:Royal Navy..................6,000Army.................. 40,000Royal Air Force     ...............10,500There have also been improvements to the training syllabus, to make it more demanding, and in the officer to cadet ratio.137. Total strength of the Sea Cadet Corps has dropped slightly, inphase with the post-war birthrate ; seven new units were formed duringthe past year, however, bringing the total to 397. During the year, theGirls&apos; Nautical Training Corps was affiliated to the Sea Cadet Corps.138. A steady proportion of the recruits for the Royal Navy come fromthe C.C.F. and S.C.C., and the Navy will continue to provide realisticnaval training for the cadets. In 1964 nearly 1,600 boys went to sea in H.M. Ships including 125 who took part in the R.N.R. exercise RockhaulII to Gibraltar and Lisbon. Another 7,400 visited Naval establishments fora variety of courses.139. The Army Cadet Force has continued to flourish in 1963-64, despitea slight decrease in numbers. This success is due to the untiring work ofthe volunteer officers and other adults. The training of the older boyshas been improved and the Territorial Army has been able to assist,particularly by providing instructors for training sessions.140. The total strength of the Air Training Corps is 2,700. Both the combined Cadet Force and the Air Training Corps contribute much tothe regular recruitment to the Royal Air Force, and in the twelve monthsup to 30th June, 1964, over a third of direct entry Aircrew and nearly half of all Officer Cadets were former members of the A.T.C. or C.C.F.In addition, nearly half the youth entry and nearly a quarter of the adultentry into the Royal Air Force consisted of former cadets. Flying Scholar-ships for private pilot training were awarded to 350 cadets and 2,250 cadetswere trained to glider pilot proficiency standard. Over 7,000 cadets tooyoung to pilot gliders were given passenger flights in gliders.EQUIPMENTResearch and Development141. Work is in hand on the revised Aircraft Research and development programme in view of decisions recently announced. Drawing up a revised programme consistent with our needs and resources will take time. It willbe facilitated by the strengthening which has taken place on the centralDefence scientific machinery under the Chief Scientific Adviser, who hasnow two Deputies, one dealing with Projects and the other Research.

It willbe facilitated by the strengthening which has taken place on the centralDefence scientific machinery under the Chief Scientific Adviser, who hasnow two Deputies, one dealing with Projects and the other Research.
Equipment142. As stated in Part I, in planning an Equipment Programme for thethree Services we must avoid both the dangers of, on the one hand, giving them inadequate and out-dated equipment, and on the other, of aiming at such a degree of sophistication that the equipment is far too late intime and far too expensive. Operational Requirements and technologicaladvances must be examined critically in order to seek to strike the most effective balance possible. As stated in Part I, machinery is being developed(e.g. in tne field of Operational Requirements and Operational Analysis)in order to tackle this problem. Careful attention must also be paid to questions of reliability and serviceability and ease of maintenance.143. Where it has been decided to introduce very sophisticated equip-ment, Research and Development will take a long time. New weaponsmay run into teething problems before they can be brought into service.Moreover, when the new weapons are in service, their complex nature, whichmay be a product of new and little tried techniques, makes accurate fore-casting of defects in operation, and the future need for spares, a most difficult tasks. Thus, problems may continue to arise and full reliability ofnew weapons may often be difficult to secure. The growing complexity of newequipment and shortcomings of the equipments already in service makeheavy demands on those who may have to fight in the front line andon those whose duty it is to maintain in full serviceability the equipment which the fighting man uses. Each advance in the complexity of new weapons underlies the importance of reliability and ease of maintenance.While sophisticated equipment is under development we must always beready to re-appraise it. This will require effective arrangements for timeand cost control. When timely review, based on such arrangements,indicates that an equipment is no longer likely to be worth the effort,we must be prepared to scrap it and go for something simpler which willarrive in time.144. Continued intensive staff effort on the Equipment Programme willbe needed, from the earliest stage right through until the equipment isin service or, indeed, until it has finally gone out of service. Lessonsfrom experience must be studied for future application and every techniquethat can be evolved must be used as fully as possible.Royal Navy145. In the Royal Navy&apos;s equipment programme for 1965-66 provisionfor the construction of new ships and the purchase of new aircraft is 133m in 1965-66 compared with  105m in 1964-65. New naval construc-tion includes the continuance of the Polaris programme, and the secondnuclear-powered hunter-killer submarine H.M.S. Valiant, will be completed during 1965-66. H.M.S. Fearless and H.M.S. Interpicl, the two new assaultships, are expected to enter service in the coming year and the escort fleetwill be strengthened by the addition of four more Leander Class frigates and of a fifth County Class guided missile destroyer equipped with theSea Slug Mark 2 surface-to-air guided weapon system. Three more fastreplenishment tankers and three survey vessels are also expected to enter service in 1965-66. The conversion of H.M.S. Blake to carry anti-submarinehelicopters is due to start in April. Delivery of the Mark 2 versions ofthe Buccaneer and Sea Vixen will continue.
Army146. Typical examples of the difficulties encountered by the Army inthe development of complex new equipment are to be found in the newrange of armoured vehicles now coming into service. These are beingovercome but have led to delays. The multi-fuel engines used for theChieftain, Abbot and tracked armoured personnel carrier has been slow to develop because it is technically very advanced and therefore difficultto progress.   New ground has been broken in the process.147. Production of new equipment for the Army continues to increase.Provision in estimates for deliveries of lighting equipment in 1965-66 isabout  f!4m compared with  97m in 1964-65. The new Chieftain mainbattle tank should enter service during the year, initially in training establishments. The tracked armoured personnel carrier, which enteredservice in 1964-65 will be produced in larger numbers and with a multi-fuel engine. The self-propelled 105 mm. Abbot close support gun and theAmerican M.107 self-propelled gun will both be issued to units during thecourse of the year. Deliveries of the Vigilant anti-tank guided weaponstarted in 1964 and there will be continued deliveries of the Wombat andCarl Gustaf anti-tank weapons and the new 81 mm. mortar and general purpose machine gun. The Stalwart high mobility load carrier, whichhas now passed its acceptance trials, will start full production. The second and third logistic ships will be completed during the year and there willbe further deliveries of new radio equipment.148. As to the equipment, of the fighting soldier, it is now recognised thatin the jungle he should carry no more than a 55 lb. load, and it is hoped to provide him with lighter yet robust equipment. For example, a lighterration pack is under trial in the Far East, where efforts are being madeto improve the special pattern of boot issued to troops operating in the jungle.  Trials of lighter personnel weapons are also taking place.Royal Air Force149. The problems posed by the development and maintenance ofsophisticated equipment apply particularly to the Royal Air Force. Thegrounding of the entire Valiant force and its subsequent complete with-drawal from service because of fatigue problems have already been announced.These problems, the first evidence of which appeared last August, have presented the Royal Air Force with serious difficulties in respect of itsin-flight refuelling and long range photo reconnaissance capabilities. steps are in hand to accelerate the conversion of Victor aircraft for these roles.Meanwhile adjustments have been made in the deployment of our fightersso as to permit overseas reinforcement, and Canberra photo reconnaissance aircraft are being used to carry out as much as possible of the surveywork which would have fallen to the Valiants. There is no evidence to suggest that the more recent types of V Bomber are likely to beaffected by similar fatigue problems.150. As stated in Part I, a decision on a replacement for the Canberrahas been deferred. The Hunter is to be replaced by the United StatesPhantom which has a high capacity both as a fighter and as a groundstrike aircraft (and which is also being bought for the Royal Navy),together with a developed version of the vertical take-off Kestrel (the
P. 1127). To replace the Hastings, the Beverley, and eventually the Argosyaircraft it is proposed to order the United States C.130E, and to replace the Shackleton Mark II maritime reconnaissance aircraft an order is being placed for an adaptation of the Comet. All these new aircraft will comeSnto service by the end of the decade. A Kestrel evaluation squadronhas been formed as a joint British-American-German unit to investigatevarious concepts of V./S.T.O.L. operation, and their control and logistics.151. In 1965-66 expenditure on aircraft and stores will amount toabout  270m. compared with an estimate of  234m. in 1964-65. On theaircraft side about  26m. will be devoted to new transport aircraft. Thiswill include payment for the majority of the ten Belfast aircraft whichare being delivered in 1965-66 and the following year. A start will also bemade on the delivery of the Andover short range military freighter. delivery of the 20 Basset communications aircraft now on order, which begin in1964-65 will be completed in 1965-66. (The Basset is the Service namefor the Beagle B.206.) Most of the order for the Dominie advanced naviga-tion trainer aircraft (a version of the H.S.125) will also be delivered during1965-66. Among combat aircraft the re-equipment of the fighter force withthe Lightning Mark 3 interceptor will continue.152. Modern high performance aircraft demand better local controlfacilities and an extensive equipment replacement programme has been drawn up using modern British radar for airfield surveillance and precisionapproach. Work is going ahead on the integration of plans for the NationalAir Traffic Control Service and there will be substantial expenditure on military radars and centralised data handling facilities in 1965-66.153. For flying training the Lightning 5, which enters service in 1965,will provide dual instruction in the Lightning weapons system. The newDominie advanced navigation trainer will enter service at the R.A.F.Advanced Navigational School and the College of Air Warfare. operational training units and squadrons are making increased used of flight simulators,which enable the number of flying hours to be kept to the minimum. Argosyflight simulators of an advanced design are now in operation in Benson andThorney Island.Helicopters154. Although about 300 helicopters are already available to the three services (excluding training aircraft and reserves), the capability of theforce needs to be increased. Steps have already been taken to makemaximum use of existing resources. For example, nearly the whole of thelong-term reserve of the Royal Air Force helicopter force has been putinto the front line, and effective capacity has been improved by an increaseof 50 per cent, in flying hours of troop-lift helicopters operating in supportof the Army in Malaysia. Troop-lift capability has also been improved inthe Royal Navy. Other means of rationalising the use of helicopters arebeing studied by the three Services jointly.155. The introduction of the Wessex Mark 2 twin-engined troop-lifthelicopter into Royal Air Force service during 1964 has added considerably to the capability of the front line. More helicopters of this type are tofollow.   The Royal Navy is receiving further Wessex Mark 5 helicopters
for troop-carrying and will also be acquiring Sioux helicopters (the namefor the Bell light helicopter) for reconnaissance. The Army, too, is to have asubstantial number of Sioux helicopters for support duties with combatunits ; and deliveries of the Scout helicopter will continue. New deliverieswill continue to increase significantly the size and capability of our helicopterforces over the next few years.Hovercraft156. A Joint Service Hovercraft Unit with two SRN5s is now in theFar East. The Inter-Service Hovercraft Trials Unit has continued evalua-tion of the SRN3 at Lee-on-Solent.ADMINISTRATION : OTHER ACTIVITIESServices Works ProgrammeWorks in the United Kingdom157. Works services in the United Kingdom in 1965-66 will be maintained at a higher level than in 1964-65.158. For the Royal Navy work on the Polaris operating base at Faslanewill be continued in the coming year. Work necessary to enable Rosythdockyard to refit nuclear submarines will be largely completed this year.159. The programme for modernising and redeveloping the accommoda-tion in Fleet Shore Establishments continues. In addition some 8,750 married quarters are now available or under construction and in 1965-66 the first of the estate of 1,000 maisonettes at Gosport will be completed, built onan industrialised system.160. For the Army 28 large projects will have been completed in 1964-65,including Stanhope Lines, Aldershot, comprising four unit barracks. In all12 major units, training establishments and other depots will be providedfor and 32 large projects will have started, including accommodation for two major units and eight large training establishments. During 1965-66,22 large projects are due to be completed including Chattenden Barracks,Chatham, part of the Royal School of Military Engineering. At the sametime, 58 projects are due to start, including the re-building of Hyde ParkBarracks, the School of Infantry, Warminster, and the Guards Depot atPirbright. Completions of married quarters are expected to reach 1,700 inthe current year and 2,400 in 1965-66. Included in the expected completionsfor 1965-66 and 1966-67 are about 1,200 married soldiers quarters to be built by an industrialised system in the Aldershot and Salisbury Plain areas.161. For the R.A.F. work is in hand to enable full effect to be givento redeployments of R.A.F. units on a smaller number of stations. Workcontinues on the installation of the new air defence radar systems and workwill shortly start on the extensive installation of the second transport command base for long range transport aircraft.162. About 1,400 married quarters are expected to be completed in1964-65 and in 1965-66 it is planned to start construction of a further,500.
Works Abroad163. In the Middle East the bulk of the living accommodation in theArmy township at Little Aden is now complete and the whole projectwill have been finished by mid-1965. Improvements to existing Army andR.A.F. single accommodation, including the installation of air conditioning,are in hand and construction is planned to start on additional air conditionedsingle accommodation, and on amenities. A new R.A.F. hospital is under construction at Bahrain, and most of the accommodation there for theBritish troops will be complete by March, 1966. The provision of improved and extended technical servicing facilities for aircraft continues.164. In the Far East, there is a substantial building programme at HongKong, which is being financed by the Hong Kong Government. additional accommodation is being built at the Singapore naval base to meet the build-upof the Far East Fleet, and will include quarters for a W.R.N.S. unit.165. In Germany, the emphasis will continue to be on improving thegeneral standard of barracks and on providing additional facilities such as new primary and secondary schools. The construction of blocks of flatsby German contractors for hiring to the Army and R.A.F. as married quartersis going ahead well.166. In Gibraltar, the rebuilding of the Fleet shore establishment H.M.S.Rooke will begin early in 1966 and the R.N. Armament depot is being re-developed. Work will continue on the New Fortress Headquarters and onthe barracks for re-housing the garrison. It is hoped to make a start on some 100 Army married quarters mostly for Other Ranks.Royal Dockyards167. The four Royal Dockyards in the United Kingdom at Portsmouth,Devonport, Chatham and Rosyth employ in their productive departments over35,000 workpeople with a wages bill of nearly  30m. a year. Portsmouthand Devonport, each with 12,000 men, are among the largest industrial undertakings in the country. The Royal Dockyards at Singapore and gibraltar have an annual wages total of about  2-5m. and the number of work people employed is approximately 6,700.168. The Royal Dockyards are specially laid out equipped and mannedfor their main task of repairing, modernising and maintaining the ships of theFleet. The special facilities enable them to refit the complex equipment, suchas weapons and electronic equipment, which is installed in modern warships.Devonport Dockyard, for example, was capable of undertaking the extensivemodernisation of H.M.S. Eagle which was completed in 1964. Portsmouth,Devonport and Chatham also build new warships. The total value of the productive work carried out in the Royal Dockyards is now upwards of  100m.a year.169. The Royal Dockyards also provide base support for the Fleet. Theycontain stores, victualling and armament supply organisations which caterboth for the ships and for the Naval establishments ashore in the areascovered by the Dockyard ports.170. The new dockyard organisation is now in being at Chatham andRosyth, and is proving its worth. A similar organisation is being introduced at Portsmouth.
Royal Ordnance Factories171. The Royal Ordnance Factories are being kept up-to-date withtechnological advances and modern equipment. The number and strengths of the Factories have been reduced in recent years in view of the smallertotal munitions needs of the smaller Armed Forces, but the Factories remain the major U.K. producers of the conventional weapons, ammunition and fighting vehicles that are coming into service. Every effort will be made tosecure the optimum number of defence and other contracts for the royal ordnance Factories. Concurrently with their main production effort, the factories will also continue to undertake experimental and design work in aid of the research and development programmes.Maintenance Command172. The main engineering and supply support of the Royal Air Forcein the United Kingdom is provided by Maintenance Command. Its unitsundertake major overhauls, modifications and reconditioning of aircraft, thesalvage and repair of aircraft, the servicing of complicated electronics equip-ment, mechanical components and systems instruments and armament andthe manufacture of various items required by the Service. The Commandalso stores and distributes to the whole of the Royal Air Force, completeaircraft and MT vehicles, fuel, explosives, medical supplies and the whole range of technical and domestic equipment used by the Royal Air Forcenumbering nearly a million separate items. The Command has its own GasProduction Factory which produces oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and corn-pressed air and supplies these to units of the Royal Navy and Royal AirForce at home and overseas. Maintenance Command employs some 15,000civilians with a wages bill of  10,800,000 a year. Its units are spread overEngland, South Wales and Northern Ireland.Other ActivitiesSurveying173. Survey ships of the Royal Navy have continued to carry out undersea exploration at home and abroad. Of a total of 12 vessels, eight werelast year charting sands and shoals in our own coastal waterways while thefour larger ships concentrated on deep sea work from the North Atlanticto the China Sea.174. Most of the present survey ships are dated and are being replaced bynewly designed Ocean Survey Ships, H.M. Ships Hecla, Hecate and Hydra(specially designed for the dual role of oceanography and hydrography) ofwhich the first has already been launched. The Government intends to buildnew Coastal Survey Craft for hydrographic work overseas. Two convertedminesweepers entered this service during the year, and there will be furtherminesweeper conversions by 1967.175. Other surveys over land included flights by Bomber Commandphotographic reconnaissance aircraft which undertook aerial surveys of large areas of Southern Rhodesia, Zambia and Bechuanaland, as well as of british guiana and Trinidad and Tobago, and surveys were made of parts of sarawak and Sabah. Among the aims of the 1964-65 joint-Service expedition(which is now in progress) are to carry out a traverse of the island of SouthGeorgia, to climb Mounts Paget and Sugar Top and to make surveys ofsome unmapped areas.
Oceanography176. The National Environment Research Council is to take over respon-sibility for the National Institute of Oceanography, but a close association between the Institute and the Ministry of Defence will continue. The Depart--s   ment will continue to rely on the Institute for the conduct of basic research and added emphasis is being given to military oceanography.Royal Observatories177. The Science Research Council is to take over responsibility forthe Royal Observatories at Herstmonceux and Edinburgh. There hasalways been a close working arrangement between the Royal GreenwichObservatory and the Navy, which has relied on the Observatory for navi-gational, time and other information. There will continue to be a defenceinterest in the work of the Royal Greenwich Observatory, which is responsiblefor the compilation of the Nautical Almanac, and a close association between the Department and the Observatories.Meteorology178. Preparations for installing a faster computer in the meteorological office Headquarters at Bracknell are nearly complete. The machine shouldbe in full operation by the summer of 1965 when still further improvedmethods of calculating the atmospheric pressure 24 and 48 hours aheadwill be brought into regular use.179. Pictures of cloud formations over the British Isles and adjacentareas of the Atlantic were received at Bracknell from the Americanexperimental weather satellite Nimbus A, using equipment assembled in the meteorological Office workshops. Results were also received from instru-ments supplied by the Meteorological Office for the Anglo-U.S. satelliteAriel II designed to measure the distribution of ozone in the high atmosphere.Measurements of wind and temperature between heights of 65,000 and210,000 feet were made by instruments carried on the Skua meteorologicalrocket launched from the Ministry of Defence range on South Uist. Anunmanned meteorological observing station which interrogated by G.P.O.telephone was successfully tested.180. The twice-monthly forecasts of the weather for a month ahead havehad some success and have proved their value for many purposes.181. A contract has been placed for an automatic chart plotter. Thiswill first be used to produce the hourly charts which show the weatherat about 100 observing stations in the British Isles. The machine completesin about five minutes a chart which takes nearly an hour to plot by hand.182. The Meteorological Office is extending its observational and research work on the measurement and distribution of rainfall. The Office will-operate in the programme for the International Hydrological Decade which began on 1st January.Fire Fighting183. In 1964 a pilot scheme was introduced to train three units of theTerritorial Army in fire fighting during their annual camp at the Army HomeDefence Centre. In 1965 the scheme will be expanded to embrace thirteenTerritorial Army units, which will be earmarked to mobilise during thefollowing year with fire equipment in support of the civilian fire authorities.
REORGANISATION AND RATIONALISATIONProgress of Reorganisation at Ministry of Defence Headquarters184. The unified Ministry, which came into existence on 1st April, 1964,brought together four major Departments of State under the control of theSecretary of State for Defence. Within the Department, by Act of Parliament,a Defence Council was set up to formulate major Defence policy and exercise the powers of command and administrative control previously exercised bythe Board of Admiralty and by the Army and Air Councils, and newBoards were established under the Secretary of State to manage the three services.185. The naval, General and Air Staffs have now been, brought together in the Defence Staff; a Defence Operations Centre has been established,under the control of the Defence Operations Executive ; a combined DefenceSignals Centre has also been built and is in operation ; the integration ofSignals and Intelligence Staffs has made good progress. A Defence Opera-tional Requirements Staff has been created, and is working successfully toco-ordinate and formulate requirements for weapons and equipment on a defence, rather than on a single-Service basis. Scientific staffs are beingstrengthened, and a unified Operational Analysis Staff is being created. a defence Secretariat has been set up within which a Deputy Secretary,specially appointed for the purpose, is now in full time charge of workon the defence programme and budget. Senior staff, military and civilian,have been appointed so that the rationalisation of the administration of thethree Services can be given special attention. A Central Establishmentorganisation has been set up whose duties include, in conjunction with theEstablishment staffs of the Navy, Army and Air Force Departments of theMinistry, the central co-ordination of departmental management includingthe control of overall numbers and the co-ordination of the deployment of civilian administrative and senior scientfic staff.186. The security organisation in the Department has also been improved.The Army and Air Force departments have, in the past year, each formed a centralised Directorate of Security ; the Navy Department established aDirectorate of Naval Security in 1962. This standard form of organisation,v/orking in conjunction with the Security Adviser whose appointment was described in paragraph 88 of Cmd. 2097, will facilitate the co-ordination of security policy, the standardisation of security practices and generally the promotion of maximum efficiency in this vital area throughout the Dcpart-ment and the three Services.187. The reorganisation of the Department entailed the move into whatis now the Ministry of Defence Main Building of some 2,400 staff of theformer Ministry of Defence, Admiralty and War Office. A further large-scale programme is now in hand in co-operation with the Ministry of public building and Works to reallocate accommodation in the Old Admiralty and old War Office buildings, and the smaller buildings occupied by the formerDefence Departments in the Whitehall area, so that increasingly staffs with similar responsibilities for the three Services will be housed alongside one another.188. The initial increase in the Central Staffs of the unified Ministryrequired for new tasks and by this major reorganisation was largely offset by
economies elsewhere. Thus the net increase in total Headquarters staff as estimated on 1st April, 1964, was only 70. As already announced, steps have been taken to effect further economies, wherever possible, in Head-quarters staff. By comparison with a total of about 24,200 on 1st April,1964, the total on 1st April, 1965, will have decreased by about 640 to23,560. It is estimated that there will be a further decrease at headquarters of approximately 140 by 1st April, 1966. At out-stations, taking bothindustrial and non-industrial staffs together, there has been a reduction ofabout 20,500 between 1st April, 1964, and 1st April, 1965, and there isexpected to be a decrease of about 1,500 between 1st April, 1965, and1st April, 1966.189. Further economies will be realised partly through the normal pro-cesses of establishment control, i.e., the inspection of complements and the review of tasks, partly through progressive improvements in departmentalefficiency, e.g., the introduction of modern office equipment, and partlythrough general review of departmental organisation in the light of experienceof the Departments working since 1st April. It has been accepted, inaccordance with the recommendation in the Fifth Report of the estimates committee, Session 1963-64, that there should be a specific enquiry intothe organisation and establishments of the Ministry within two years.Other Steps towards Administrative Rationalisation190. In recent years inter-Service co-operation in logistic and administra-tive matters has continuously increased. The creation of the unified Ministryof Defence has made it possible to consider a substantial extension of existing arrangements for inter-Service co-operation.191. Communications. The amalgamation of the Services&apos; strategicalcommunication networks, with the final aim of a single integrated network,is progressing steadily. Joint communications centres are already working at aden and Bahrein and a study has just been completed on the possibilityof amalgamating the Services&apos; communication facilities in Singapore.192. Lands. The unification of the Lands work of the three Services underthe Minister of Defence for the Army is now in progress. Joint heads of theDefence Lands Service, an Under Secretary and a Directing Grade Profes-sional Lands Officer, were appointed last June. By mid-September they had formed, with staff from the three Service Departments, one unified branchto deal with all Defence Lands work from overseas and another to implement the Lands reorganisation and co-ordinate estimates for Lands expenditurein a single Vote to be introduced for the financial year 1965-66. At OverseasCommand HQs unification of Lands work is nearly complete. UnifiedMinistry branches dealing with acquisition and estate management and withdisposals of all Defence lands at home will be set up in the course of theyear. It will be a longer process to bring together the work of local LandsOffices in the United Kingdom in such a way to combine good service forthe forces with maximum economy in the use of lands and of staff; thisfinal stage in the reorganisation is now being planned in detail. The unifi-cation of Service lands work is expected ultimately to produce staff savings of the order of 15 per cent, on existing strengths and an annual financialsaving on staff salaries of about  250,000.
193. Airfield Construction. The responsibilities of the Airfield Construc-tion Branch of the Royal Air Force are to be transferred to the royal engineers, and the Airfield Construction Branch is progressively to bewound up. Transfer terms have been offered to as many of the R.A.F.personnel as can fill posts in the Army and wish to be transferred. Compen-sation will be paid to those airmen who could not be offered transfer whenthey can no longer be employed in the R.A.F. in their present trade andengagement, or be remustered in another R.A.F. trade. This merger should eventually save about 250 men or about  300,000 per annum ; and it isalso expected to lead to savings in administrative costs.194. Logistic Services(a) Action is in hand to introduce common supply and logistic proce-dures in all three Services. An Inspector General of Codificationand Standardisation has been appointed to direct the work being done in the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Aviationtowards the introduction of a single system (based upon thatdeveloped in N.A.T.O.) of codifying stores and equipment. Withouta common supply language, which will ultimately be devolped in this way, the full advantages of integrated supply management,stock control and provisioning procedures cannot be achieved.The magnitude of the task is indicated by the fact that there are more than 2 million items of supply now found in the inventoriesof the three Services. The Inspector General is also responsiblefor accelerating progress in inter-Service standardisation of stores and equipment, which should lead to greater flexibility betweenthe Services and considerable economies. Proposals are also being considered for common stock control and requisitioningprocedures in all three Services.(b) The arrangements for co-ordinating contracts on behalf of theServices and for inspecting the stores and equipment purchasedhave been strengthened. Common forms and procedures will beintroduced as far as practicable. The possibility of delegating to approved firms responsibility for quality control, so eliminatingunnecessary duplication between the various Inspectorates is being studied. The development of new inspection methods and equip-ment, the arrangements for inspecting materials, and the use ofcommon standards of measurement, are also being examined.(c) The possibility of bringing the Movements branches of the three services under unified direction has been studied. The conclusion reached, however, is that the existing central machinery for theco-ordination of movements is so well adapted to operational andlogistic needs, that nothing would be gained by replacing it with asingle executive organisation.195. Supply Services(a) Accommodation Stores. The scheme for the rationalisation of thesupply of accommodation stores (i.e. furniture and domestic equip-ment) to the Armed Forces is to be implemented in 1965-66.Under the scheme the M.P.B.W. will undertake the initial furnishingof new buildings in the United Kingdom, and one Service (the
R.A.F.) will be responsible for the maintenance of accommoda-tion stores in all three Services, and for the initial furnishing ofnew buildings overseas. The new scheme will enable the &apos;and furnishing of new accommodation in the United Kingdom tobe treated as a single task. In addition to establishing a singleagency within the Ministry of Defence for dealing with accom-modation stores it will standardise scales and designs of furnitureand domestic equipment between the Services. In due coursesavings in staff, storage accommodation, and stockholdings areexpected to be substantial.Clothing. It has been decided that there should be one organisa-tion in the Ministry of Defence responsible for the design, develop-ment, procurement and inspection of clothing (other than flyingclothing and survival equipment) for all three Services and forthe storage of cloth required for making up into Service clothing.(c) Medical and Dental Equipment and Stores.   It has been decidedthat there should be one organisation in the Ministry of Defenceresponsible for the procurement, storage and supply of medical and dental equipment and stores to all three Services.(d) Food. There will also be a single management authority for the procurement, storage and distribution of food to all three Services.(e) Petrol, Oil and Lubricants.   Responsibility within the Ministry ofDefence for placing contracts for Petrol, Oil and Lubricants, mis-cellaneous fuels and solid fuel for all three Services is also to becentralised.(/) Motor Transport. A study is in hand to assess the advantages ofsimilarly centralising responsibility for the supply, storage and repair of a wide range of Motor Transport in common use in thethree Services.196. Personnel Administration. Since the establishment of the unifiedMinistry of Defence studies have been initiated into the following aspectsof personnel administration :(a) Medical Services.   A Committee is examining the scope for someintegration of the medical services of the Navy, Army and R.A.F.(b) Education and Training :(1) A Committee has been set up to consider the role of higherdefence studies in the education of senior Service officers and civil servants, as a means of providing advice to the Ministry ofDefence and as a means of informing and influencing publicopinion. The Committee is examining the nature and organisa-tion of higher defence studies in the United Kingdom and is considering what improvements are necessary and what linksshould be established with the community at large.(2) A Committee is examining the implications for the Servicesof the education developments foreshadowed in the RobbinsReport on higher education and the Newsom Report onsecondary education.
(3) The scope for Inter-Service rationalisation of various aspects of training, including the major subject of stall training is also being examined.(c) Recruiting. The scope for closer co-operation between the recruit-ing organisations of the three Services is being considered.197. Accounting and Costing Procedures(a) Before the unified Ministry of Defence was set up the formerMinistry of Defence and the Service Departments charged one another for work done or services rendered. It has now beenpossible to simplify procedures and work by largely eliminatingthese adjustments.(b) Arrangements have also been made for the closer co-ordination ofcosting throughout the department so that common methods and procedures can be adopted, new ideas exchanged, the comparison of costs between the three Services made more productive and theuse of costing as an aid to management generally encouraged.Future Developments in Defence Organisation198. The changes, already decided or now contemplated, in organisationand procedures both at Headquarters level in the Ministry of Defence andin the field, as described in this chapter, may lead, in due course, to more fundamental changes in the structure of Service administration as a whole.
PART IIICIVIL DEFENCEOTHER EXPENDITURE NOT INCLUDED IN THEDEFENCE BUDGETCIVIL DEFENCE199. For the financial year 1965-66  21-9m. has been provided in theEstimates for expenditure by civil departments on home defence. Details are set out in Part IV, Annex E. The form of our civil defence preparation, inthe years ahead is being reviewed in the light of the general reconsideration ofdefence.200. Arrangements have been made for an emergency system of control,for the maintenance of law and order and for the marshalling of the available resources food, water, medical supplies and raw materials.201. An effective organisation for warning the public of an attack and formonitoring radioactivity has been established, including a communicationssystem for the rapid transmission of warnings, and headquarters and postsfor the Royal Observer Corps.202. Planning for the maintenance of essential supplies and services in anemergency continues. The system of control has been further developed and preparations are proceeding, including preparations by the local authorities,203. The full effect of the reorganisation of the Civil Defence Corps intro-duced in 1962 is now becoming apparent, and recruits who are prepared toaccept the obligations which membership of the Corps now entails are coming in steadily. The Auxiliary Fire Service has been similarlyreorganised.204. To help the police maintain law and order, plans have been made forthe formation of reserve units which would be sent to stricken areas after anattack. Regular training is given for this task and for all other war-timeduties of the police.205. Good progress has been made in stockpiling equipment to fight war-time fires. Planning for emergency fire-fighting continues. arrangements were made during 1964 for selected Territorial Army units to receive trainingin a fire-fighting role.206. Plans for expanded war-time hospital and casualty services have been further developed, and the allocation of medical manpower in war-time isunder discussion with representatives of the medical profession.207. Planning has continued for the procurement, control and distributionof food, for emergency feeding and for agricultural production after anattack. In addition, stocks of food and emergency feeding equipment arebeing maintained.208. Plans for the maintenance of other services include the stockpilingof equipment to enable water supplies lost by damage to installations or by
contamination to be replaced. Preparations also cover the maintenance of communications and a broadcasting service in war, and the due functioning of transport.209. A pilot, survey of shelter against raido-active fall-out has been carriedout, and the results are being studied.210. To enable the Government of the day to put dispersal arrangementsinto operation if they considered it right to do so, the broad outline of ascheme was announced in 1962 for the movement of priority classes mainlychildren and their mothers away from the most densely populated parts ofthe country. The local authorities are engaged in working out the detailed plans.  Fresh guidance has been given to them on plans to help the homeless.OTHER EXPENDITURE211. Apart from Civil Defence the Financial Secretary&apos;s Memorandum on estimates also classifies under &quot; Defence &quot; some other activities not providedfor in the Defence Budget. (The Defence Budget is a block of expenditure which is treated as a whole for the purposes of financial control. It consists of expenditure by the Ministry of Defence and expenditure on militaryaccount by the Ministry of Aviation, the Ministry of Public Building and works and the Atomic Energy Authority.) The items concerned are asfollows. Their estimated costs in 1965-66 are summarised at Part IVAnnex E.Purchasing (Repayment) Service Votes212. Purchasing (Repayment) Services Votes provide the initial finance forthe purchase of military and certain other equipment, primarily for theMinistry of Defence. The expenditure is eventually recovered, in the mainas a charge to the Defence Budget, and, taking one year with another, the votes are roughly in balance. In 1965-66 it is estimated that the ArmyPurchasing (Repayment) Services Vote will be in debit by  2m. and thatthe Ministry of Aviation Purchasing (Repayment) Services Vote will be incredit by  31 -6m. This credit represents that part of the repayments bycustomers which will be paid into the Exchequer as Exchequer ExtraReceipts.Military Aid to Overseas Countries213. The cost of any military aid given to overseas countries is met fromthe Vote of the oversea Department concerned. For Commonwealth training at home and assistance overseas this assistance is estimated to cost  3m. ;some  30m. for Commonwealth defence supplies may also fall in this period.Allied Services by Civil Departments214. Civil Departments provide the following services and bear thecost involved: civil superannuation, headquarters accommodation, stationeryand printing and publicity.Total Expenditure  attributed  to Defence  in  the  Financial  Secretary&apos;sMemorandum215. Finally, the Financial Secretary&apos;s Memorandum excludes from&quot; Defence &quot; expenditure expenditure for meteorological services which, thoughborne on Defence (Air) Votes and hence included in the Defence Budget for
financial control, is primarily for civil purposes. The total expenditure thusattributed to Defence in the Financial Secretary&apos;s Memorandum equals thetotal amount of the Defence Budget plus the estimates for all the items listedabove less the estimated cost of expenditure on meteorological services.Manpower216. An analysis of the active strengths of the three Services is given&quot; in annex &apos; A&apos;, Table 1. The strengths in Table 2 are additional to those inTable 1 and consist of forces and units enlisted overseas and personnelenlisted into the forces on local service terms.217. In 1965-66 the Armed Forces will need about 45,500 male entrants.This figure includes men who enter upon regular engagements, young soldiersand young airmen, and those who enter as boys, apprentices and juniors.218. An analysis of the Volunteer Reserve and Auxiliary Forces and national Service Reserve for the three Services is given in Annex &apos; a table 3.219. An analysis of recruitment to the three Services during the last four calendar years is given in Annex &apos; A &apos;, Tables 4, 5 and 6.Finance220.
