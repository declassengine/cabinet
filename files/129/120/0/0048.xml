THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. March 1965C. (65) 48 Copy No.      5 926th March, 1965CABINETATLANTIC NUCLEAR FORCEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs attach, for the information of my colleagues, a paper describingour proposal to establish an Atlantic Nuclear Force (A.N.F.).M. S.Foreign Office, S.W.I.25th March, 1965.OUTLINE OF HER MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTSPROPOSALObjectivesIn proposing a reorganisation of the nuclear arrangements of the atlantic Alliance Her Majesty&apos;s Government have the followingobjectives:(a) We want a solution which will foster the strength and unity of the alliance as a whole by taking account of theposition of those non-nuclear members who want toexercise greater influence on nuclear planning, policy andstrategy. In particular we want as far as possible to take account of the political and military requirements ofGermany.(b) As far as possible the nuclear forces committed to theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) should beunited under a single unified control system, forming an integral part of the defence structure of the alliance as awhole. The control system should be closely linked withNATO, though not in such a way as to enable membersof NATO not taking part in the force to exercise a vetoon it. It should also be open-ended and allow for newparticipants to join, particularly France if she does not join from the start.(c) In addition we want to promote increasing consultationwithin the alliance on the policy of the Western powers with regard to nuclear weapons in any part of the world.5542a
Although the present nuclear Powers are committed to consult the North Atlantic Council if time permits before they use nuclear weapons anywhere, there is nocontinuous consultation about deployment of nuclear weapons or situations which might require their use.The European countries however have almost as great an interest in the use of the United States strategic nuclearforces as in nuclear forces committed to NATO.Proposal2. Her Majesty&apos;s Government would like to propose that tomeet these objectives an Atlantic Nuclear Force (A.N.F.) should beestablished with the following components:(a) The British V-bomber force, except for those aircraft whichare needed for existing commitments (primarilyconventional, but, in certain circumstances, nuclear)outside the NATO area; and a British fleet of polaris submarines when available.(b) At  least an  equal  number of United  States  polaris submarines; and possibly some Minuteman missiles inthe United States.(c) Some kind of mixed-manned and jointly-owned element orelements in which the existing non-nuclear Powers could take part.(d) Any forces which France may decide to subscribe.3. The inclusion of a mixed-manned element would allow thenon-nuclear countries to take part in a meaningful way. This would leave open the possibility that some weapon systems, e.g., bombersor Minuteman missiles, provided from national sources, could bemixed-manned and possibly included in the mixed-manned ^elementitself.4. The elements contributed to the A.N.F. by individual countries would be committed to it for as long as NATO continuedto exist. All elements, whether contributed from national resourcesor mixed-manned, should be collectively owned.5. The whole Force would be under a single Authority onwhich all countries taking part in the Force would be entitled to berepresented. All members of the Authority would have equal rights,without any discrimination between them, over all elements in theForce. Thus, any country contributing elements from its national resources and any country participating in the mixed-mannedelement would be equally entitled to exercise a veto over the use ofthe entire Force and over any changes which might at any time be proposed in the control system. This does not exclude the possibility that provision could be made for the control arrangements to be reviewed later, for example if the major nations of Europe achievefull political unity, in such a way as to enable the European vote tobe cast as one. The European unit exercising a single European votewould have the same veto rights as individual Governments taking part in the Force.
SECRET.36. The Authority would consist of the permanent representatives to NATO of the countries concerned and would be located at NATO Headquarters. Since the President of the UnitedStates would be retaining control of the bulk of the nuclear weaponscapable of being used in the defence of NATO, it is for consideration whether the Ambassadors at Washington of the countries concerned should also be formed into a special consultative committee through which the President could obtain advice in an emergency. In additionto this permanent machinery, there would be advantage in periodicmeetings of Ministers of Defence to consider such things as targetingpolicy, nuclear weapons developments, nuclear dispersal plans, andfuture force structure.7. The functions of the Authority, who would act on instructions from Governments, would be:(a) To provide the Force Commander with political guidance.(b) To   approve   the   Force   Commander&apos;s   targeting   and operational plans for the use of all weapons of the Force,which should be drawn up in close consultation with the strategic Air Command at Omaha.(c) To take the decision to release nuclear weapons to theForce Commander and to authorise him to execute agreedplans for their use.(d) To develop doctrine on the role of all types of strategic andtactical nuclear weapons.(e) To consult and discuss possible contingencies anywhere inthe world which might give rise to the possibility of nuclear weapons being used, while ensuring that the viewsof all interested allies are taken into account in drawing up whatever unified plans may be necessary to meet thesecontingencies.8. The targeting of the A.N.F. would be co-ordinated with thetargeting of all United States forces in the Atlantic area, i.e., thereshould be close co-ordination between the targeting of weaponsprimarily intended for the defence of Europe and strategic weapons in the United States, whether or not their primary purpose isAtlantic defence.Non-dissemination9. In order to ensure that the new arrangements could not result in, or be accused of leading to, dissemination of nuclear weapons, it would be desirable to incorporate in the Charter of theForce clauses whereby the nuclear members would undertake notto disseminate nuclear weapons and the non-nuclear members would undertake not to acquire them or control over them. Moreover, inorder to comply with the principles of non-dissemination, thereshould be a prohibition on nuclear weapons passing into the ownership or control not only of individual non-nuclear countriesbut also of a group of.such countries. A suggested text of a passageon these lines for inclusion in the Charter of the Force is at annex to this paper.SECRET5542 a 2
British contribution10. We are prepared to commit immediately to the A.N.F.eight V-bomber squadrons (64 aircraft). Over the period 1968-70these will be replaced by the British fleet of Polaris submarines. Weare prepared to contemplate mixed-manning within those V-bomber squadrons which are fully committed to the A.N.F.11. We are proposing that there should be at least an equal number of United States Polaris submarines in the Force, so that weare in practice thinking of a combined fleet of either six or eightboats, with a total armament of 96 or 128 missiles.Mixed-manned component12. We accept that the mixed-manned element is the only way in which the existing non-nuclear countries can be enabled to take part as members of the Authority in ownership and manning of nuclear weapons systems within the Force, without transgressing theprinciples of non-dissemination. We recognise that the United states will have to take part in the mixed-manned element in order to make its composition consistent with the principles of non-dissemination.But for our part we should not wish to contribute to a surface shipcomponent over and above our contribution to the Force fromBritish national resources; we could however consider contributing to a land-based component based on weapons already existing orprogrammed.13. The creation of a new strategic force of surface ships armed with Polaris weapons is the least desirable way of applying the mixed-manned principle.14. The strategic forces available to the alliance are alreadyadequate for the purpose of deterring Soviet aggression. The missileship force could only be used in the context of the general strategicexchange when all the other strategic forces available in support ofthe alliance were also committed; it would thus be superfluous tothe requirements of the alliance. It would also unnecessarily increasethe number of nuclear weapons to the possible detriment of East-West relations; it would add to the risks of incidents at sea; and itwould increase the total financial and manpower burden of the alliance.i 15. In our view, therefore, the mixed-manned element of theA.N.F. should consist of existing or already planned weaponssystems. Our first choice would be existing Minuteman missiles on united States soil. These are strategic missiles in the purest senseand therefore particularly appropriate to the kind of A.N.F. beingproposed. The joint ownership of a force of such weapons based inthe United States would epitomise the American-European link; itwould not (as with the seaborne force) mean creating a new forcein a new environment and would thus have attractions vis-a-vis the manpower and financial aspects and in the context of arms controldiscussions, since it would not, in effect, be adding to the overallmissile potential of the West. If such a concept would presentinsuperable difficulties to the United States Government, then we
should like consideration to be given to land-based aircraft andmissiles in Europe on the lines of the British proposals put forwardduring last year. We realise, however, that the inclusion of tacticalinterdiction weapons of this kind would have implications for thecharacter of the Force and the command arrangements appropriate to it.Permissive action links16. In the event of the alliance, and thus the Force, coming toan end, submarines and bombers and their related missiles andwarheads would revert to the national ownership of the country which had originally contributed them. Missiles and warheads in the mixed-manned element would also be returned to the supplyingcountry. Permissive action links designed to make operationalcommand more effective could be installed in all elements of theForce, provided they did not prevent this reversion to national controlif the alliance came to an end.Command arrangements and relations with NATO17. There are two solutions to the Command problem toplace the A.N.F. with its own Commander under SACEUR or undera new and separate NATO command.18. SACEUR is a theatre Commander whose primary task isto conduct the tactical land-air battle for the defence of Europe. This,by itself, is a very substantial responsibility for one Commander toexercise and there are strong arguments against giving him the addedresponsibility for conducting a strategic offensive against the soviet union and targets far removed from the immediate battle area. Onthe other hand, we recognise that SACEUR has a special position inthe eyes of European countries as the Commander directly interestedin the defence of the European theatre and that these countries wouldbe reluctant to see his role weakened in any way and would prefer tosee any new force placed at his disposal.19. The alternative is to place the Force, together with its ownCommander, under a separate NATO Commander. The appointmentof a new NATO Commander, especially if he were a supreme commander, would emphasise the importance of the A.N.F. and thenew departure which it would represent. It might also serve toemphasise the desirability of co-ordinating the policies of the A.N.F..with those of the external strategic forces. Our preference is thereforefor the assignment of the Force, with the Force Commander, to anew NATO Supreme Commander. The Force Commander, whilesubordinate to the new Supreme Commander for NATO purposes,would also remain responsible to the Authority of the A.N.F. andwould obey the Authority&apos;s instructions. The exact terms of the assignment of the Force to NATO command would need to be worked out.20. The Force would be collectively owned by the participating countries and countries contributing forces to it would give up titleover them to the Force collectively. The owners would then assign
the Force to NATO similarly to the way in which a member countryassigns forces to NATO, for co-ordination with the other forces available to the Alliance, in accordance with the approved strategy and operating procedures of NATO. This would be essential becauseeven if hostilities started with a conventional exchange, the possibilityof direct escalation from conventional weapons through tactical nuclear weapons to strategic nuclear weapons must be presented tothe enemy as an effective deterrent. At the same time, however, wemust reckon with the possibility that the normal functioning of nato might be inhibited by lack of co-operation on the part of oneor more of its members, or indeed by an attempt to veto recourse to force. The existence of this possibility would detract from the credibility of the Force as a deterrent if it was irrevocably assigned to NATO. To guard against this, therefore, the owners of the force must collectively retain the ability in the last resort to exercise controlof the Force without the possibility of an effective veto by non-participants and so to instruct the Force Commander.Finance21. The question arises of financing the capital and operating costs of the Force as a whole. This is something on which further discussion will be needed. It can more appropriately be discussedwhen the size and shape of the Force is more precisely known.AnnexATLANTIC NUCLEAR FORCEIn furtherance of the purposes underlying Resolution 1665 (XVI)adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on the4th of December, 1961, and with a view to facilitating agreement on general and complete disarmament under effective international control, those Governments who already manufacture and ownnuclear weapons solemnly declare as follows:(a) they will not transfer any nuclear weapons directly or indirectly, either through the organisation created by thepresent agreement or by any other means,(i) either into the national ownership or control of Statesnot now possessing such weapons, or(ii) into the ownership or control of any association ofwhich they are not members or in which power toprevent the use of such weapons is not retained byall of them;(b) they will not assist such States individually or collectively inthe manufacture of nuclear weapons or transmit to theminformation necessary for their manufacture.2. To the ends set out in the foregoing paragraph the otherGovernments parties to this agreement solemnly declare as follows:(a) they will not, individually or collectively, manufacture nuclear weapons;
(b) they will not, directly,. or indirectly, either through theorganisation created by the present agreement or by anyother means, acquire national ownership or control ofany such weapons;(c) they will not bring any nuclear weapons into the ownershipor control of any association of which those Governmentswho already manufacture and own nuclear weapons arenot members, or in which power to prevent the use of suchweapons is not retained by all those Governments;(d) they will not individually or collectively seek or obtain fromother States information necessary for the manufactureof nuclear weapons.
