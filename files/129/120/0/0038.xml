THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  March 1965C. (65) 38Copy No.1st March, 1965CABINETSOUNDPROOFING OF PRIVATE HOUSES NEAR LONDON(HEATHROW) airport memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster the purpose of this memorandum is to seek a decision on thequestion, on which the Home Affairs Committee have been unableto agree, whether the Airports Authority to be set up under a bill now before Parliament should be enabled to pay grants of 50 percent (up to  100) towards the cost of improving the sound insulationof three rooms in existing houses within a defined area near London(Heathrow) Airport. These proposals are similar to those made in1962 by the Committee on the Problem of Noise under thechairmanship of Sir Alan Wilson, which were not accepted by theprevious Administration.The problem. Traffic at Heathrow is increasing steadily and an increasing proportion is carried in jet aircraft (44 per cent of all movements in1964, 37 per cent of summer night movements). Noise has alreadyincreased since the studies on the basis of which the WilsonCommittee reported that many people near Heathrow were subjected to a greater degree of noise than they could reasonably be expectedto tolerate. Everything practicable has been done to reduce the noiseof jet aircraft at source, and for the last three years restrictions havebeen imposed on the number of night flights by jets.* There is increasing pressure from the airlines and their Governments for anincrease in the number of permitted night flights. It is estimated that*Suramerf night jet flights at Heathrow ll.-p.rn.

by 1970, even if the present number of night services were maintained,the number of night )et flights would be doubled. If the growing demand for night tourist flights is to be met and, in addition,provision is to be made for an increase in all-freight services (whichfly at night), by 1970 the airlines&apos; requirements for night jetmovements between 11.30 p.m. and 6.30 a.m. are likely to be about10,000 compared with the 3,500 authorised for this year. The numberbetween 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. would be much greater. It is not considered practicable to divert this traffic to Gatwick, or to Stansted(when constructed), because the airlines have their maintenance andhandling facilities at Heathrow. Nor is it considered possible to allow an increase in night jet traffic on this scale unless measures are takento reduce the impact of noise on householders in the area.Proposals3. It is proposed that a 50 per cent grant, subject to amaximum of  100, should be offered to owners or occupiers ofhouses erected before January, 1966, who by 31st December, 1970,install a specified system of sound insulation, consisting of double-glazing with a simple form of forced ventilation, in up to three rooms, e.g., two bedrooms and one living room. The grant would be available in respect of houses in wards lying within aparticular &quot; noise contour &quot;. If all those eligible for the grant claimedit, the cost would be  6 million, but it is thought that not more than40 per cent would do so. This would reduce the amount of the grant to  24- million which, if amortised over 20 years, would cost theAirports Authority  220,000 a year. It is suggested that the localauthorities should be asked to administer the grant without chargingadministrative expenses in view of the benefit which they derive from the operation of the airport in the form of rates. If the proposal were approved, the necessary powers could be conferred on the newAirports Authority in the legislation currently before the House ofLords.Arguments in favour of the proposals.   In favour of these proposals it is argued that (a) it is economically unsound not to use to the full the facilities at Heathrow, and that the growth of traffic, bothpassenger and freight, would contribute considerably tothe growth of the economy. In this air freight isparticularly important. It is increasing rapidly and will reach 500,000 tons by 1970, 70 per cent carried in fullfreighters, many of which must be heavily laden noisyjets flying at night. Restrictions on this growth would bevery detrimental to the economy;(b) attempts to hold night flights at or near existing levels will involve increasingly difficult annual negotiations withairlines and strong representations from foreign government;
(c) in view of the increase which additional flights would produce in the level of noise which the Wilson Committeefound to be more than many people could be expected totolerate, it would be unreasonable to allow flights toincrease without assisting householders to providethemselves with some measure of protection;(d) with an unlimited increase in night jet flights the airports authority&apos;s revenue from landing fees would be  162,000higher than if restrictions continued at their present level.To the extent that this would exceed the extra costs of night landings, the net revenue could be set against thecost to the Authority of making grants. In addition theMinistry of Aviation would receive  65,000 a year innavigational service charges. The Airports Authority willfrom the outset make a profit on its revenue account sothat no part of the cost of servicing a loan for the purposeof the grant would fall on the tax-payer;(e) Heathrow is unique in the level of noise which it is liable to generate, and a scheme there would not expose theGovernment to irresistible pressure for similar concessionselsewhere.Arguments against the proposals.  It is argued against the proposals that:(a) The scheme would not prevent a public outcry againstunrestricted operation of jet aircraft either from those who,at the expense of  100 of their own money, had reducedbut not stopped the noise, or from those both withinthe specified area and outside who, without participating in the scheme, suffered from any increase in night flying.(The survey conducted by the Wilson Committee showed that large numbers of people outside the area coveredby this scheme were also subjected to a greater degreeof noise than they could tolerate.) It is therefore,unrealistic to suppose that assistance with soundproofingwould pave the way to public acceptance of more nightjets.(b) If night jet operations are permitted to reach the levelscontemplated for 1970, applications for grants in theHeathrow area are likely to be much greater than theestimated 40 per cent of householders, and the cost would therefore exceed  2-1- million.(c) Payment of grant by the Airports Authority would not relieve the Exchequer of the financial burden, since the authority will require Exchequer loans for many years to come and would have to borrow a corresponding extra sumfrom the Exchequer to meet the cost of the grants.Although no part of the cost of servicing the loan would fall on the Exchequer, nevertheless it would be an
additional burden on the Exchequer to have to providethe loan, and this, in the present precarious financial situation, is not thought to be justified.id) Proposals have already been put forward for soundproofingsome schools in the area. The scheme would expose theGovernment to pressure to agree to soundproofing otherschools and probably hospitals.(e) Once the principle of compensation for nuisance caused inthe exercise of statutory functions was conceded, it wouldin practice be impossible to confine payment to personsliving near Heathrow or disturbed by aircraft noise.There was an immediate danger of the demand spreadingto military airfields where, although the noise level didnot at present approach that at Heathrow, there was already complaint about low circuit flying at night, andnoise might increase with the introduction of more powerful machines. Other civil airfields would alsoproduce increasing noise with increasing traffic (it might,however, be assumed that houses built in the future nearcivil airfields would be designed with appropriate noiseinsulation). There was already considerable complaintabout noise from overhead motorways which carried asubstantial volume of heavy lorries through residentialareas at night. The risk of expenditure to which theExchequer might be exposed by a concession at heathrow could therefore be very high.summary the questions for consideration are:(a) Should a scheme be introduced for the payment by theAirports Authority through local authorities of 50 percent grants up to  100 for improvements in the soundinsulation of houses built before 1st January, 1966, in a specified area near Heathrow?(b) If so, should the necessary powers be conferred onthe Airports Authority in the Bill currently beforeParliament?D. H.Whitehall, S.W.1,1st March, 1965.
