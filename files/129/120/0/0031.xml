THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. February 1965C. (65) 31 Copy No.    5322nd February, 1965CABINETTRIBUNALS OF INQUIRY (EVIDENCE) ACT, 1921Memorandum by Secretary of State for the HomeDepartmentOn 1st December last, in a written reply to a Question byMr. Bellenger suggesting the setting up of a Select Committee toconsider the working of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act,1921, the Prime Minister said &quot; Certainly concern has been expressed about the working of the Act. I am giving consideration to thismatter, but I am not yet in a position to make a statement.&quot;2. In recent years anxiety about the working of the Act hasbeen expressed on every occasion on which the report of a tribunalset up under the Act has been debated. The main criticisms that have been made are that the inquisitorial nature of the procedurenecessarily adopted by most tribunals established under the Act isunfair; that wholly innocent and respectable people may become involved and may have to incur heavy expenditure in being legallyrepresented before the tribunal; that the actual procedure before thetribunal, including such matters as the leading of evidence by counsel, the cross-examination of witnesses and the part played bythe Attorney-General, is open to criticism; and that the arrangementsfor dealing with witnesses who refuse to answer questions areunsatisfactory.3. The most recent debates on this subject were in the Houseof Lords on 4th December, 1963, and in the House of Commons on16th December, 1963. In the Commons debate the suggestion wasmade from our side of the House that a Select Committee should beappointed to enquire into the operation of the Act and this suggestionhas been pressed on other occasions.4. In my view an inquiry is desirable and I have given somethought to the form it might take. The broad argument in favour ofa Select Committee is that the matter to be investigated is of directParliamentary concern since express Parliamentary authority isrequired for the appointment of a tribunal. On the other handobjection to a Select Committee might be taken on the grounds that5417
there would be a risk of its being, perhaps unconsciously, influenced by political considerations in dealing with a matter which should be examined with judicial impartiality; and the staff which would beavailable to it would have no experience of tribunals or the problems to which they give rise. The alternative which I favour is an inquiryby a Royal Commission. I do not think that for consideration ofan issue of this importance a departmental committee would carrysufficient authority.5.  I suggest terms of reference as follows:&quot; To review the working of the Tribunals of Inquiry(Evidence) Act, 1921, and to consider whether it should beretained, and if so whether any modification of the powers conferred by it or of the procedure followed under it is necessary or desirable.&quot;These terms of reference would allow the Commission to considerboth the need for keeping the Act on the Statute Book and thepossibility of amending it or changing the procedure followedunder it.6. As regards membership I suggest that the Royal commission should be a small one. It would seem right to have a judicial chairman and there might be four other members perhaps a peer from one side of the House and a Member of Parliament from the other andtwo non-political members.7.  I invite my colleagues to approve these proposals.F. S.Home Office, S.W.1,19th February, 1965.
