THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1965C (65) 419th March, 1965CABINETRAIL CLOSURESMemorandum by the Minister of TransportBackbench pressure for changesI am being pressed by our backbenchers to do three things:(a) to halt all passenger closures,(b) to halt all freight closures,(in both cases at least until Lord Hinton&apos;s study is completed);(c) to accept in some form Sir Alexander Spearman&apos;s Bill whichwould give me power to rescind consents already given topassenger closures.2. This pressure, I am convinced, is based largely on a misunderstanding of our policy and of the place of railways in a modern, co-ordinated transport system. I recommend that it shouldJbe resisted.Current policy. As my colleagues are aware, I took the first opportunity ofthis Parliament to make a statement of policy in the House on 4th November on the subject of passenger closures. The main points of this statement were as follows:(a) While regional transport plans were being prepared, I wouldnot consent to any major closure, i.e., a closure likely toconflict with those plans;(b) Even where I did consent, I would insist on the retention ofthe track except where I found that this was an unnecessary precaution;(c) I instituted a new procedure for ensuring that &quot; obviousnon-starter&quot; proposals were not, for the present, putforward by the Railways Board at all and thus did nothave to go through the full statutory machinery ofT.U.C.C. hearing, etc., before being rejected;Copy No.5481
(d) These safeguards would ensure that no irrevocable action could take place to prejudice our planning policies andwould at the same time enable the railways and the countryto achieve immediate financial savings wherever this was justified.The statement was generally welcomed from our own side of theHouse and in the country as a whole.4. This policy is consistent with the principles of our transport policy and with our plans for modernisation. It fits in with other action in this field, notably the establishment of regional planningmachinery, the institution of a study on transport co-ordination, andthe appointment of Lord Hinton as Special Adviser on TransportPlanning. All these are steps towards fulfilling the main pledges on transport in our Manifesto.Opposition to closures5. Opposition to passenger closures has always existed. It stemsin part from the local people (whether or not they use the trains)and from their Members, in the area of each particular closureproposal as it comes up; in part it comes from the railway employeesaffected. Even the modifications and restrictions which I announcedhave not significantly diminished it, but it has recently intensifiedbecause of two misconceptions over our own principles (a) the fact that closures are still going on in spite of our&quot; pledge &quot; (everyone regards his own line as &quot; major &quot;);(by my &quot; failure &quot; to prevent closures agreed by my predecessorfrom taking place or to take powers to rescind consentswhich he gave.6. The attitude of those directly affected is natural andunderstandable; but this is not to say that it is in the national interest.Moreover, I think it is easy to exaggerate the support for these views in the country. I believe that informed public opinion accepts thecase for modernising our railway system and pruning little-used lines.Place of closure programme in railway modernisation7. The closure programme is not just an end in itself, though we must not forget the very large financial advantages which it could bring; these were estimated in the Board&apos;s 1963 Report at up to 40 million per annum, equal to more than half the cost to theExchequer of the recently-announced increases in National insurance benefits. The programme is even more important as an integral partof the reshaping of our railways. The present system is largely theresult of unplanned, competitive private enterprise growth inVictorian times, and it needs drastic pruning and replanning for theneeds of the second half of this century. Two examples are (a) the closure of 12 stations on the Shrewsbury-Aberystwythline will assist rationalisation of the through services(enabling through trains to be speeded up by 20 per cent)and achieve annual savings of over  200,000;
(b) the network of coal depots, with an average radius of distribution of 2\ miles, was tailored to the age of the horse and cart. The result is that in 1960 60 per cent ofthe 5,031 depots were either totally or almost unused.With a 10-mile radius (perfectly feasible with motorlorries) 250 centres could serve the whole country.8. Cutting out the waste and over-provision of both freight and passenger services will not only release resources for productive usebut enable the railways themselves to carry out more effectively thejobs they are really fitted for fast trainloads of freight and passengers over the longer distances, and commuter services.Implementation of closure policy9. On the passenger side, I am already holding up &quot; majorclosures &quot; in accordance with our election pledge; for instance, I have refused consent to the closure of the Manchester-Bury electric line,and the services on the Glasgow-Edinburgh line via Shotts. I aminsisting that the East Lincolnshire services, particularly to the holiday resorts, should be maintained for the time being. And theRailways Board have decided to defer the Liverpool/Southportproposal. But there are certainly proposals to which I can properlygive consent without causing serious hardship or prejudicing futureplanning.10. Closures of freight lines and depots are quite another matter. Almost all the opposition to freight closures comes from therailway unions, who want to protect their members againstredeployment. I have no power to intervene and, at present at anyrate, I do not wish to have such power. The closures make very little difference to most customers. They are interested not in the route bywhich goods travel, but in the cost and speed of delivery.Rationalisation and re-routeing enable the railways to carry the sametraffic more efficiently and economically and so the customer benefits:all this leads to genuine co-ordination by enabling the train (long distance) and the lorry (short distance) each to do its appropriatejob. It seems most unlikely that Hinton&apos;s study could produce resultsinconsistent with what the railways are doing.The Spearman Bill11. Acceptance of Spearman&apos;s Bill would re-open the 150consents given in the last 18 months and create tremendous localagitation and anxiety during the necessarily long time that it wouldtake to reassess each one; and it is most unlikely that a review would justify reversing more than a very few decisions, and perhaps none atall. Moreover, no future decision could ever be regarded as final, andthis uncertainty would place the Board in an impossible position overthe management and development of the railway system.Conclusions12. Our present policy is sound. We lean over backwards toprotect the individual from hardship and to avoid prejudicing future
regional planning or the study on transport co-ordination. TheRailways Board deal generously with their staff who are affected by offering other jobs (with transfer grants) or adequate redundancycompensation. I see our present rail policy as an integral part of theGovernment^ plan for modernising the economy. Redeployment oflabour is vital to our economic growth.13.   I recommend that we stand firm.T. F.Ministry of Transport, S.E.1,8th March, 1965.
