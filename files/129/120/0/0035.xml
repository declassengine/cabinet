THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1965C. (65) 35 Copy No.  5926th February, 1965CABINETDEDUCTION OF UNION SUBSCRIPTIONS FROM pay memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Union of Post Office Workers (U.P.W.) have asked the PostOffice to agree to deduct union subscriptions from pay.2. Until now the U.P.W. have been unable to persuade thethe other unions represented on the Staff Side of the national whitley Council to join with them in making this request. TheU.P.W. therefore felt free to act on their own and put a separaterequest to the Postmaster-General. This they have done on several occasions but it has always been refused. The situation has now changed. I understand that the Staff Side have recently decided toask for the facility to be granted to any recognised Civil service staff Association which seeks it.3. In the non-industrial Civil Service deductions from pay arealready made free of charge for a limited number of purposes,notably for National Savings and for various Civil Service charitiesand welfare schemes. They are also permitted, for a fee of 2\ percent, for life insurance premiums paid to insurance companies witha large volume of business with civil servants.The case for meeting the request4.  The main arguments for meeting the request are:(i) the facility would greatly benefit the U.P.W. and other largestaff associations as it would solve the problem of collection in large branches covering several offices andwith a membership working round the clock. It would prevent members from getting into arrears, help tomaintain the membership and reduce losses frommismanagement. It would substantially reduce the cost of collection even allowing for the 2\ per cent charge whichthe unions are prepared to pay.(ii) Management would benefit by saving the time wasted bylocal collectors &quot; going their rounds &quot;.(iii) If management helps the unions in this way to improve their efficiency, it is better placed to press for Staff Sideco-operation in joint productivity, etc.5453N
The case against meeting the request5. Earlier requests have been turned down on the followingbroad grounds:(i) the scheme might be represented as putting pressure onpeople to join the unions.(ii) There   are   political   objections    and    administrativecomplications arising from the political levy.(iii) The collection of union subscriptions is not generally regarded in this country as a proper job for management,and this is not a matter in which the Government should appear to be giving a lead to outside industry.(iv) It would extend the principle of deductions from pay andweaken the case for continuing to resist the continualpressure which the Treasury is under to permitdeductions for national charities, such as the Red Cross,and for subscriptions to professional bodies.(v) It would favour recognised, as opposed to unrecognised,staff associations and make it more difficult for newassociations to establish themselves.(vi) It would put extra work on departmental accounts branches.(vii) It would be very difficult to resist the pressure which theindustrial trade unions might develop for the extension ofthe facility to industrial civil servants.Comments6. My comments on these objections (many of which have lostforce in recent years) are as follows:(i) There would be no improper pressure. All civil servants areat present encouraged to join a staff association or union.The scheme would be entirely voluntary. Refusal toauthorise a deduction would not necessarily signifynon-membership.(ii) The political levy raises the major problems, and I deal withthem below.(iii) The practice of union deductions has existed for a&apos; considerable time in the B.B.C. and National Coal Board.&quot; It has recently been extended to British Railways and is growing in private industry. The Government would nolonger be in the position of &quot; giving a lead &quot;.(iv) Pressure for further extension of the principle of deductionscould be resisted, on the ground that these deductionsrelate closely to a person&apos;s employment.(v) The   element   Of   discrimination   against   unrecognisedassociations would be slight, and in any event this objection is not a weighty one.(vi) Mechanisation of payrolls makes this objection much lesssignificant, and the 2\ per cent charge would cover thecost.
(vii) It must be accepted that if the facility were granted to non-industrials, it would have to be granted to anyindustrial unions who applied for it. In this case thequestion of the political levy would assume much greater importance. It is likely, however, that most industrialunions would continue not to ask for it, from fear thatit would weaken them by diminishing the personal contact between their members and the collector. The Minister ofHealth anticipates that a demand for the facility wouldalso result in the National Health Service both fornon-industrial and industrial staff, and would have to begranted.7. At present there are two unions represented on the Staff Sideof the National Whitley Council which have a political levy, namely the U.P.W. and the Post Office Engineering Union. The problems arising from the political levy are:(i) The Opposition would object that it is improper for theGovernment to operate a scheme which in practice would benefit the Labour Party alone among the political parties.(ii) The scheme would involve the disclosure to departments ofthe political affiliation of some members of the CivilService, and this would be said to be undesirable, eventhough it could occur only with the consent of the memberconcerned.(iii) There would be problems of administration. In someschemes (e.g., that of the National Coal Board) deductionsfrom wages are made at a standard rate, and those whoauthorise deductions but do not wish to pay the levy haveto claim a rebate from the union at the end of the year.This arrangement is of doubtful legality and would clearly be unsatisfactory in the Civil Service. There would therefore have to be two rates of deductions, namely for those who wanted the full deduction and those whowanted the deduction net of the levy. The unions mightwell feel that the scheme would not be worthwhile if theyhad to collect the amount of the levy separately, so thatany union member who did not want to disclose to his department that he was or was not paying the levy wouldhave to decline to authorise the deduction and continueto pay his subscription to the collector; but he would, ofcourse, be entirely free to do this.8.   From the standpoint of management of the Civil service it has seemed in the past that none of the arguments for or againstwas decisive though on balance the arguments against were somewhatstronger. But some of these no longer have their original force, andthere are now no serious management objections in principle or inpractice to the introduction of the facility.conclusions . The arguments are fairly evenly balanced, but on the wholeI think that there would be advantage in helping the staff
associations to improve their efficiency and that we should beprepared to grant the facility. I therefore recommend that when the expected request from the Civil Service National Staff Side is made,we should agree that any constituent association which seeks thefacility (and any recognised industrial union or recognised union inthe National Health Service who may later ask for it) should begranted it on condition that:(i) the association will pay 2-i,- per cent to cover the costs ofthe deduction;(ii) where there is a political levy, there will be two rates ofdeduction, namely for those who do and those who do not wish to pay the levy;(iii) the deductions will be entirely voluntary and the unions willcontinue to collect subscriptions from those members who do not want them deducted from their pay.(iv) the administrative details should be negotiated through theappropriate machinery for reaching collective agreements in the non-industrial and industrial Civil Servicerespectively.L. J. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,25th February, 1965.
