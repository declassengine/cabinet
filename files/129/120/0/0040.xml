THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1965C. (65) 40 r10th Esbmetty, 1965CABINETRHODESIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations the Lord Chancellor and I have had 10 days&apos; intensivediscussions in Rhodesia and are satisfied that we have been able togauge opinion amongst almost all sections of the European, African,Coloured and Asian communities. The situation is, we consider,grave. It can, unless most carefully handled, blow up at almost anytime, with very serious consequences not only for Rhodesia herselfbut also for Britain and Zambia and many other commonwealth and foreign countries.2. We found on arrival almost a sense of desperation amongstthe European community: little but self-interestedness and naivete&apos;among the Chiefs; and a firm expectation among the AfricanNationalists that we would pull their irons out of the fire for them.3. There is still in Rhodesia a serious danger that the SmithGovernment may, at any time when they judge the moment ripe,make a unilateral declaration of independence. Mr. Smith spokefrankly to us of his Government^ calculations and of the preparations they had made to take this step. As a result ,of ourPrime Ministers warning statement of last October, there is somerealisation on the part of White Rhodesians about what theconsequences of unilateralism would be. Certainly a majority ofWhites are not at present in favour of it. But there is a widespreadbelief among them that, however difficult a time they might haveafter unilateralism, it could not be worse than the fate which wouldbefall them in the event of an early take-over of power by the AfricanNationalists.4. This European attitude springs mainly from three causes.First, there was, before we arrived, an intense, fear that the british labour Government intended to impose majority rule under mr. Nkomo or Mr. Sithole as soon as possible. Second, EuropeanRhodesians.have been much impressed by events in the.Congo, byreports, often in exaggerated terms, of the anxieties of the EuropeansCopy No.   fj gN.5485
remaining in Tanzania, Zambia and Kenya, and by the travellers&apos;tales of people leaving those countries. Third, White Rhodesians wereshocked by the widespread intimidation and violence on the partof rival factions of African Nationalists before most of their leaders were detained or restricted, and now associate African Nationalismwith arson, murder and brutality. For these reasons there has beena marked retreat from the high water-mark of European liberalismin 1961 when the predominantly White electorate approved by a two-thirds majority the present Constitution which provides for eventual majority rule in perhaps one or two decades.5. The Lord Chancellor and I therefore conceived our most urgent task to be to prevent the Rhodesia Government from makinga unilateral declaration of independence. To this end we first impressed upon the Cabinet and the Rhodesian Prime Minister that the BritishGovernment meant every word of the warning statement of last october; and we went further by saying that if Rhodesia imposedeconomic sanctions on Zambia (which Mr. Smith denied was intendedunless Zambia took the initiative against Rhodesia) even worseresults would follow, including perhaps a mandatory resolution inthe Security Council providing for armed intervention. We also setout to reassure White Rhodesians about the intentions of the BritishGovernment and particularly that we did not propose either toviolate the constitutional convention that the Parliament at westminster does not legislate on matters within the competence ofthe Legislative Assembly of Rhodesia except with the agreement ofthe Rhodesia Government or to impose immediate majority rule.We deemed it necessary to emphasise these points in the public statement we made upon our departure from Salisbury. That statementmay thus attract criticism from African Nationalists not only in rhodesia but also in certain independent Commonwealth countriesin Africa. But this is a risk we consider we had to take to lessen the dangers of unilateralism.6. There remains the problem of finding a long-term solution to the Rhodesian political problem. This is made extremely difficult by the current polarisation of European and African attitudes. Sofar as we can judge, not only the Rhodesian Cabinet but mostEuropeans are unwilling to make any further concessions to the african Nationalists who repudiated their initial acceptance of the1961 Constitution, boycotted it, and thus refused to take the first step towards political advancement which had been opened up forthem. The Rhodesia Government feel strongly that if they startnegotiating with us or with the African Nationalists they will be ona slippery slope and, therefore, their public attitude is one of complete intransigence.7. The Chiefs are being built up by the Smith Government butthey remain unimpressive. They are concerned primarily with theirown prestige; it was quite evident that they had been schooled bythe Government; they saw the only alternative as beingindependence now or the African Nationalists now; and though theChiefs opted for independence they seemed to have little realisation
of its significance. We are doubtful about their capability of starting&quot; a Chiefs&apos; Party &quot; with mass popular support such as has gainedpower in Northern Nigeria, Swaziland and Bechuanaland.8. Mr. Nkomo, Mr. Sithole&apos;s second-in-command,Mr. Takawira, and those of their followers whom we met were buoyedup by the expectation that Britain would call a constitutional conference and impose, if necessary by force, a new Constitution ona one-man one-vote basis. There is quite strong evidence that bothin repudiating the 1961 Constitution and in their subsequent actionsthey are jumping to the tune of their paymasters, who may includeGhana, the U.A.R., Algeria and possibly the Communists. Webelieve that, right up to the moment when they are completelyconvinced that no external pressure can give them what they want,they will go on making demands which there is no chance of white Rhodesians accepting. We believe we convinced them of our inability and unwillingness to solve their problems for them.9. I am circulating this report for my colleagues&apos; information at this stage. I am considering what we can now do to secure some improvement in what is undoubtedly a very difficult situation.A. G. B.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1,9th March, 1965.
