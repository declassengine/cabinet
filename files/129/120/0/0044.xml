COMFIDIKTfAt.230ANNEXMINISTERS STATEMENT IN parliament with your permission Mr. Speaker, and that of the House, Ishould like to make a statement on this yearrs Annual AgriculturalReview.One of the Governments aims in this Review has been topromote developments in agricultural policy which we believe mustbe made if the industry is to go on increasing productivity, and soimprove its income while reducing its need for Exchequer support.One of agriculture&apos;s main problems is the wide differences betweenfarms.    There are many farm businesses which already provide asatisfactory full-time livelihood.    But there are far too many others which, because they need better managernent or are too small in size,cannot do so at reasonable prices.    Our objective is to create conditionsin which such farmers can raise their standards.In this Review we are making a start on these longer termdevelopments by introducing a number of new production grants andrevising some of the existing ones.    We shall help the smaller farmerto improve his farm business by making better farm management theessential object and condition of a Small Farmer grant.    At the sametime we shall extend the upper limits of the schemes so as to make them available to many more farmers, particularly the smaller dairyfarmer and livestock rearer.We are also introducing wider agricultural credit facilities and providing grants for agricultural co-operative marketing.    In addition,we are concentrating more help on the hill and upland areas.    The hillsheep subsidy will be made an annual grant on a flat rate; the hill cowsubsidy rate will be raised;  and we are bringing in new winter keeparrangements.    There will also be an urgent review of the more funda-mental long-term problems in the hill and upland areas.These measures will give help to those in special need who are willing and able to help themselves.    But many of the smaller farmbusinesses, if they are to succeed, must also obtain the advantages which come from larger scale production or marketing.   We are,therefore, planning measures to encourage an increase in the size ofholdings on a voluntary basis and to extend further help to agriculturalco-operation over a wider field.Turning now to the present position of agriculture generally,actual farm income for this year is expected to be  472 million, a record figure and  63 million more than last year.    Adjusted for normal weather conditions the forecast for this year is  456-1 million - 30 million more than last year.    Output is up substantially, and thegrowth in productivity has continued.-1-

Coming to the commodities, let me deal first with milk.    Anumber of producers are still giving up dairying, but the fall in the dairy herd now seems to have been checked, and production has risenslightly.    Producers&apos; prices have gone up appreciably.    In view ofthe importance of the dairy herd not only for milk but also for beef, theGovernment have decided to increase the guaranteed price by Id. a gallon.    This change, together with increased distributive costs, willrequire the retail price to be raised by -f-d. per pint with effect from1 st August.After a temporary decline, the beef herd is now recovering.But, in view of future world prospects, we are encouraging expansionof home production by an increase in the guaranteed price of 4/- percwt.    At the same time we are widening the calf subsidy to bring inmore calves and increasing the rate by 10/-.    We are also increasingthe Hill Cow Subsidy by  1.    The sheep breeding flock continues to grow and no change will be made in the guaranteed price for fat sheepor for wool.    The new flat rate subsidy for hill sheep will be 18/-compared with an average of 9/6d. over the last five years.Pig numbers have considerably increased, and a further substantial rise is forecast.    For much of the last year however themarket for pigs has been reasonably strong, and, in view of this, theGovernment have decided to raise the middle band - in effect thestandard quantity - by 900,000 pigs.    We are also widening the middleband, and the steps on either side of it, so as to make changes in the guaranteed price less frequent.    The decision first announced twoyears ago to abolish separate stabilising limits and to reduce thequality premiums will now be implemented.    The combined effect ofall these steps would considerably increase profitability and so run the danger of encouraging too high a level of pig production.    As someoffset, the basic guaranteed price will therefore be reduced by l/7d.per score, but the immediate net effect will be that on average pigproducers will be getting lid. per score more than at present.This year egg production has outrun demand.    Although thereare signs that production next year may be somewhat less, technical efficiency is still increasing.    To try to avoid a return to surplus, the guaranteed price for eggs will be reduced by Id, per dozen.Cereals production has risen to a very high level this year.   Inconsequence v/e are obliged under the cereals agreements on minimum import prices made by the previous Administration to take remedial action with the purpose of restoring a fair and reasonable balancebetv/een home grown and imported cereals.    The standard quantitiesfor wheat and barley will be increased to take account of the growth in consumption, but the guaranteed prices will be cut by 1/ld. and l/4d.per cwt respectively.    The guaranteed price of potatoes and sugar beetwill be increased by 5/- and 2/6d. per ton respectively.    the fertiliser subsidy will be reduced by  2 million, and the lime subsidyby  750,000.The net effect of the Review decisions will increase the total value of the guarantees by over  10 million.   This will mean that in thepresent circumstances of the national economy, the agricultural industry will, like others, be expected to absorb this year through theirincreasing productivity a large part of their increased costs of some 29 million.    The present determinations will, however, give theindustry the opportunity to improve its income, and a start has beenmade on policy developments of great importance to the industry inthe longer term.

ANNUAL REVIEW AND determination of GUARANTEES, 1965I.  Developments in Agricultural policy. Agriculture is one of our biggest industries, and, as such, must take its proper place in the national economic development plan which is now being prepared. The Government will therefore be considering in this contextwhat contribution agriculture can best make to national economic growth.Nevertheless, the Government have reached conclusions on certain linesof agricultural development which they consider desirable, and the 1965Annual Review of the economic condition and prospects of the agricultural industry has been conducted against this background.2. The Government consider that the principles of the Agriculture acts of 1947 and 1957 provide a sound framework for agricultural policy. these principles recognise that a stable and efficient agricultural industry must bemaintained ; that such an industry should be capable of producing such partof the nation&apos;s food and other agricultural produce as in the national interestit is desirable to produce in the United Kingdom; and that such production should be at minimum prices consistent with proper remuneration and living conditions for farmers and workers in agriculture and an adequate return on capital invested in the industry.3. Stability for agriculture is provided in this, as in most other developed countries of the world, through a system of Government support. But thelevel of that support must be of crucial concern to any Government. If theindustry is to become less dependent upon Exchequer assistance, while at thesame time producing what is needed from home sources, the annual rate of growth in productivity, which has already been running at the high rate of5 per cent, in recent years, must be maintained and, if possible, increased.The Government consider therefore that a primary objective of futureagricultural policy must be to encourage this growth in productivitythrough:  (a) the maintenance of stability in the industry ;(b) the further progressive introduction of new technological improve-ments ; better farm management; and improved marketing ;(c) encouragement to farmers generally to obtain the benefits of scale in production and marketing ; and(d) the consequential further release of resources for use elsewhere inthe nation&apos;s economy.4. Agricultural research and advice and the application of their results are basic to a further increase in productivity. With the complexity and rapid development of technology the need for these services is increasing.The Government intend to maintain them and have already strengthened theagricultural advisory services. One of the most important aspects of thework of these services is advice on farm management. Proper farm recordkeeping is essential for this work, and the Government are, in this Review,
taking a first step by introducing a pilot scheme to encourage farmers to keepsuch records (paragraph 53).   They intend to develop this in future years.5. In addition, the Government are determined to secure better controlof animal diseases which still cost the industry many millions of poundsevery year. A number of major diseases such as bovine tuberculosis, sheepscab, foot and mouth disease and swine fever have been eradicated or arenow being brought progressively under control. We can now think ofredeploying our veterinary resources so as to concentrate more on preventivemedicine to reduce the incidence of disease in general. Regional and localStudy Groups with farmer and veterinary representation are in the processof being set up. The primary object of these groups is to make sure thatthe results of research into prevention and treatment of animal diseases are known to farmers and are applied to their animals. The incidence of diseasevaries between regions, and in areas within regions, and these Study Groupsshould result in a better overall application of veterinary preventive medicine.6. In deciding upon the best means of securing the objectives set out inparagraph 3, the Government have taken into account the complex andheterogeneous nature of our agriculture. Agriculture as a whole containsmany diverse elements. Most of the output of the industry is produced byabout a quarter of our 450,000 agricultural holdings. These holdings are,for the most part, those which, because they have taken advantage of technological progress, and because they have secured economies of scalethrough the size of their farm businesses, can be expected to have lowcosts of production. On the other hand half of our holdings produce onlya very small part of the industry&apos;s output. These for the most part consistof small acreages of land which cannot provide their occupiers with a full-time livelihood at prices which could be considered consistent with an efficient agriculture. Almost all these occupiers already have some interestin other trades and occupations, or other sources of income outside farm-ing. The remaining quarter of our holdings consist mostly of small and medium-sized farm businesses. Some of these provide a reasonable full-time livelihood to their occupiers. But many others, if they are to doso, need to be improved by better management, by the adoption of improvedtechnological methods, and by improved marketing.7. In addition, there are great differences in soil, climatic conditions,and accessibility to markets between holdings in different parts of thecountry. Geographical location must therefore be taken into account inthe formulation of agricultural policy.8. The Government consider that if farmers are to be able to earn properremuneration on the basis of prices consistent with an efficient industry,more must be done to help those occupying holdings capable of providing a reasonable full-time livelihood who at present find it difficult to earnsuch a livelihood owing to the character or situation of their farm businesses.This can be done through some reorientation of support.9. To this end the Government have in this Review extended the scopeof the Small Farmer Schemes by raising substantially the upper limits of
eligibility, while at the same time changing the character of the Schemesso as to relate them more directly to the improvement of farm businessmanagement (paragraph 50). In addition, steps are being taken to improveagricultural credit facilities (paragraph 51), and to encourage the develop-ment of agricultural co-operative marketing (paragraph 52). All these measures will be of particular benefit to smaller farmers who are able and willing to help themselves to earn a reasonable livelihood. TheGovernment also believe that consideration needs to be given to thepossibility of widening still further the arrangements to promote moreagricultural co-operative and group activity.10. The Government have also paid particular attention in this Reviewto the hill and upland areas. Special measures are required here to overcome the handicaps imposed by remoteness, altitude and climate.Present subsidies for hill areas have been reviewed. It has already been announced that action is being taken in England, Wales, and NorthernIreland to convert the winter keep acreage payments into headage pay-ments as supplements to the hill cow and hill sheep subsidies (para-graph 56). In addition, in this Review, greater stability is being givento hill sheep farming by converting the hill sheep subsidy from a payment which is uncertain and fluctuating into a flat rate which will be paid annually(paragraph 54). Lastly, the rate of the hill cow subsidy has been increased and some improvements have been made in the rate of stocking whichlimits eligibility for subsidy (paragraph 55).11. The Government also consider that there should be a review of themore fundamental problems which need to be tackled in these hill andupland areas. There have been many reports by different bodies on these problems. These have indicated that two of the most important are the size of farms, which are often too small to support a reasonable livelihood,and the need to co-ordinate the planning of land use requirements. TheGovernment will consider urgently what more should be done to makethe best use of agricultural resources in such areas, having regard tothe economic, social, and other factors involved.12. But although by these measures it is hoped that many will be encouraged to strengthen and improve their individual enterprises therewill be others who can never hope, even with this help, to secure a properremuneration from agriculture alone. These are mostly those who havefarm businesses which from their size and nature cannot yield a reasonablelivelihood on the basis of prices consistent with a stable and efficientindustry. The Government consider that there should be arrangements to encourage on a voluntary basis the amalgamation of such land intoviable and well equipped holdings. Arrangements to help improve the structural efficiency of British agriculture must clearly be long-term innature, but the Government intend to introduce them as quickly as possible.13. The Government are pressing on rapidly with the consideration ofthe three matters referred to in earlier paragraphs, namely the further extension of agricultural co-operative and group activity (paragraph 9);
the development of upland areas (paragraph 11); and structural improve-ment of agriculture (paragraph 12). As soon as sufficient progress hasbeen made with the working out of proposals, farming and other organisa-tions concerned will be consulted.14. The Government also believe that there is an urgent need to improve the marketing of home-grown produce, particularly for certain commodities.The encouragement of agricultural co-operative or group marketing is onestep. In the case of horticulture, the improvement and reorganisation of markets, together with the better grading of produce are being pushed ahead.Legislation to set up a Home-Grown Cereals Authority to operate in thenext cereal year starting on 1st July, should shortly be on the statute book. Urgent consideration is being given to proposals for the establish-ment of a Meat and Livestock Commission, which would be charged with responsibilities for the improvement of meat marketing. These proposals will be discussed with the main organisations concerned with the productionand marketing of meat.15. While, as stated in paragraph 1, agriculture^ place in the national economic development plan is being studied, the Government believe thatthe development of agricultural policy in the directions proposed will assistthe agricultural industry to maintain and increase productivity and so toimprove its remuneration while reducing its dependence upon government financial support.II.   Economic Condition of the Agricultural industry the Course of Production16. Agricultural net output increased substantially in 1964/65. With alarger acreage and good yields the production of cereals is estimated to beat the highest level ever attained. Sugar production from the 1964 crop isalso a record. The downward trend in the dairy herd and in the number of beef breeding cattle has been checked, and the long-term expansion ofthe sheep breeding flock has been resumed. Marketings of fat pigs areexpected to be nearly one million more than in 1963/64, and the productionof eggs some 8 per cent, higher. The index of agricultural net output(average of 1954/55 to 1956/57 = 100) is forecast at 137 for 1964/65, corn-pared with 127 for 1963/64 and 125 for 1962/63 (Appendix I, table K,page 31).Income17. Actual net income is estimated to have risen to  472 million- Thisis the highest figure so far recorded, and compares with the revised estimate for 1963/64 of  409 million. Part of this increase is due to the morefavourable weather ; when adjusted to normal weather conditions the fore-cast of net income for 1964/65 is  456  million compared with the revised estimate of  425^ million for 1963/64 (Appendix II, Table A,page 32).
Costs and Efficiency18. There have been further increases in the prices of goods and servicesused in agricultural production (Appendix III, page 36). It is reckonedthat these price changes would, at current levels of use, add in a full year a net total of about  29 million to the cost of Review commodities.The main item is a rise in agricultural wage rates. These increases in costs have been taken into account along with the continuing gain inefficiency which, as in previous years, has been taken at  25 million onReview commodities. This figure was last considered in 1960 and willbe reconsidered before the next Review.Cost of Agricultural Support19. The Exchequer cost in 1963/64 was  294 million. In 1964/65 itis expected to be  270 million. The chief causes of the reduction were thestrength of the meat market which resulted in higher market prices, andalso higher grain prices towards the end of the 1963 crop year ; these werepartly offset by a marked increase in the Exchequer payments for eggs.The Estimates presented to Parliament for the coming year (which do not take into account the determinations made at this Review) show an increase to a figure of  295 million.III.  Determination of GuaranteesLong-Term Assurances20. In accordance with the Agriculture Act 1957 the present deter-determinations must be such as to maintain the total value of the guarantees^at not less than 91 \ per cent, of their total value in 1964/65 after allowing for cost changes that have occurred on Review commodities since the1964 Annual Review. The value of the guarantees in 1964/65 is  1,519million. 91\ per cent, of this is  1,481 million. After taking accountof the cost increase of  29 million, the maximum permissible reduction inthe value of the guarantees would be about  9 million.Milk21. The dairy herd fell by over 4 per cent, between June 1962 and june 1964. But by December 1964 it was marginally higher than atDecember 1963, and the downward trend appears to have been checked.Production has increased and the output of milk for human consumptionis expected to be 2,513 million gallons in the year ending 31st May 1965.This is about 35 million gallons more than in 1963/64 but well belowthe level reached in the two previous years- About one-third of theincrease in output is expected to be absorbed by the rising demand forliquid milk (Appendix I, Table B, and Figure I, page 20). The amountof milk sold for manufacture is expected to rise but will be less thanin the period 1960/61 to 1962/63.* The total value of the guarantees is the sum of (i) the value of the price guarantees (cal-culated for each commodity by multiplying the guaranteed price by the quantity of outputqualifying for the guarantee) and (ii) the value of the relevant production grants.
22. The 1964 Annual Review White Paper (Cmnd. 2315) announced atotal increase of 2^-d. a gallon in the guaranteed price, of which was tohelp improve compositional quality. This, coupled with the significantdrop in sales of milk for manufacture in recent years, has led to an appreciable improvement in the average producer price (the pool price)which is estimated at 3s. l^d. for 1964/65 compared with a range of. 9d. to 2s. lO^d. in the three previous years. Nevertheless the numberof milk producers continues to fall and by March 1965 it is expectedthat there will be less than 125,000 registered milk producers comparedwith about 150,000 five years ago. This reduction is partly a reflectionof the general tendency to increased specialisation in agriculture- Butamong the other factors responsible is the increasing preference shown by farmers and workers for tasks not involving the long hours and week-end ties of milk production- The maintenance of the dairy herd isimportant not only for milk but also for beef (paragraph 25). Returnsfrom milk represent a very substantial proportion of farmers&apos; incomes.23. In these circumstances the Government have decided to raisethe guaranteed price by Id. per gallon. They consider that a larger increase is unnecessary, and undesirable in the interest of the consumer,and moreover would involve a risk of unduly stimulating production. Thearrangements for financing the Milk Boards&apos; schemes for improving corn-positional quality will continue unchanged. The standard quantities willbe increased to reflect the increases in sales for liquid consumption.Fat Cattle24. Home production of beef in 1964/65 has been running belowthe level in 1963/64. At the same time there has been some increasein imports, and total supplies have been only slightly below the previous year&apos;s level (Appendix I, Table D and Figure II, pages 22-24); but, withinthe total volume of imports, the proportion of chilled beef has declinedand that of frozen beef has risen. In 1964/65 demand has been excep-tionally strong and, while future world supply and demand cannot beforecast with certainty, this may continue.25. At home the beef breeding herd contracted between June 1963and June 1964 but is now recovering; and as already mentioned thedecline of the dairy herd, which is the source of some two-thirds of our home-fed beef, has been checked- But in view of world market prospects,the Government consider that some further encouragement should begiven to a moderate expansion of home production of beef- This isgiven in this Review by a combination of measures: first an increase inthe guaranteed price of fat cattle of 4s. Od. per live cwt.; second anextension of the calf subsidy together with an increase of 10s. Od. inthe subsidy rates (paragraphs 57 and 58); and third an increase of  1 inthe rate of the hill cow subsidy (paragraph 55).26. The extension of the calf subsidy will enable cattle hitherto excludedfrom the scheme, and in particular heifers of the dairy breeds, to qualify for the subsidy if they have in fact produced acceptable beef carcasessatisfying the requirements of the Fatstock Guarantee Scheme.  It should
give further encouragement to the retention of calves for beef and therebybenefit our home-fed beef supplies.27. The Government accept the view expressed in the 1963 annual review White Paper (Cmnd. 1968) that, while livestock producers shouldbe encouraged to seek further improvements in quality, the market andnot the Government should decide on quality, and reward it in the market price. As announced in the 1964 Annual Review White Paper, thequality differential between Grade I and Grade II cattle will thereforebe discontinued from 29th March 1965.28. As foreshadowed in the 1964 Annual Review White Paper, changes will be made from the same date in the seasonal scale of standard prices for cattle to bring it more closely in line with the pattern of market prices.The scale of abatements and supplements under the graduated deficiency round scheme will also be adjusted in the light of changed market con-ditions since the arrangements were introduced in 1964. Details of all these changes in the guarantee arrangements are given in Appendix VI, Part II,page 46.Fat Sheep and Wool29. Home-fed supplies of mutton and lamb in the fatstock year (April/March) 1964/65 have been a little above the level in 1963/64, while imported supplies have shown a small decrease due to rephasing of imports from new Zealand. Market prices in 1964/65 have been firm, reflecting thestrength of the meat market generally.30. After a check in 1963 due to weather conditions, the long-termexpansion of the breeding flock has been resumed. This reflects, in theGovernments view, the continuing profitability of home production, and nochange will be made in the guaranteed price of fat sheep.31. Adjustments will be made to the seasonal scale of standard prices (asforeshadowed in the 1964 Annual Review White Paper). Adjustments will alsobe made to the scale of abatements and supplements under the graduateddeficiency payments scheme. Details are given in Appendix VI, Part II,page 46.32. Market prices for the 1963 wool clip were relatively high, and withsome prospect of this situation continuing, the guaranteed price was raised at the 1964 Annual Review. Since then prices have fallen, but the Govern-ment have decided to leave the guaranteed price for wool unchanged.33. In addition, to provide greater stability for hill sheep farming, theGovernment have decided to place the hill sheep subsidy on a flat rate basisat a rate which compares favourably with the average of the variable payments in recent years (paragraph 54).Fat Pigs34. In the fatstock year 1964/65 rather more than 12-^- million pigs willhave been certified for guarantee. For much of the year the market has been reasonably strong, but it has recently weakened under pressure of heavy11
supplies. In 1965/66 certifications are expected to be considerably higherthan in 1964/65, and this is likely to lead to a weaker market over the year as a whole.35. The present level of the middle band in the flexible guarantee arrange-ments is 11^-1 If million pigs, and the Government have decided that itshould now be raised in order to reflect the piesent market situation. Theyhave also decided to increase the width of the middle band, together withthe steps either side of it at which price adjustments are made, and the adjustments themselves. These changes should lead to smoother working ofthe arrangements in that greater movements in forecast pig numbers may takeplace without automatic price adjustments. The new middle band will be at12-12-8 million pigs ; other details of the new arrangements are given inAppendix VI, Part II, page 47.36. The 1963 Annual Review White Paper stated that quality in fat pigsshould be determined and rewarded by the market, and that it was intendedto discontinue quality premiums for &quot; bacon pigs &quot;. It also foreshadowed the ending of the separate stabilising arrangements for &quot; bacon pigs &quot; and &quot; otherpigs &quot;, which had proved unsatisfactory in many respects. The distinctionwhich these arrangements have attempted to draw between different classesof pigs has become increasingly artificial and has led to growing inequitybetween different sectors of the industry and to misplaced expenditure ofpublic money.37. The 1964 Annual Review White Paper stated that, before this action was taken, there would be an examination with producers and the trade tosee whether provisions were necessary, either within or outside the pigsguarantee, to influence or regulate the production of bacon in order to keep it at the levels allocated to the United Kingdom by the bacon market sharingunderstanding. It was also agreed to discuss the practicability of a schemefor encouraging long-term contracts for the supply of pigs both to baconfactories and to other purchasers of pigs by deadweight. A comprehensiveexamination of these subjects has taken place since the last Review. TheGovernment are not convinced that, with adequate supplies of pigs in prospectand the greater market stability provided by the market sharing understanding,any special measures would be justified.38. The Government have therefore decided that, as a step towardselimination of the quality premiums, the payments for both Grade AA-f-and Grade AA pigs will be reduced by Is. Od. per score. They have also decided that the separate stabilising arrangements for &quot; bacon pigs &quot; and&quot; other pigs &quot; will he replaced hy a stabilising arrangement for all pigs. Butin order to limit fluctuations in producers&apos; returns and to facilitate contracting,the stabilising limits will be set at 3s. Od. above and 2s. Od. below thestandard price.39. These changes in the basis of the guarantee have a bearing on thelevel of producers&apos; returns, and have had to be taken into account in the government&apos;s determination of the guaranteed price. The combined effectof raising the middle band and reducing the value of the quality premiumswould be equivalent to a net increase in the guaranteed price for all pigs of
Is. 7d. per score. The Government consider that, with the high level ofproduction already in prospect, such an increase is not justifiable. In deciding,however, that the basic guaranteed price must therefore be reduced by Is. 7d.per score, the Government have taken into account that, at the current forecastlevel of production, the effect of the changes they have made will be animmediate improvement on average in producers&apos; returns of 1 Id. per score.Eggs40. An increase in the laying flock and higher yields per hen have ledto a considerable increase in production in 1964/65. Home productionfills nearly the whole of the market for shell eggs and egg productstaken together (Appendix I, Table E and Figure III, page 25). The over-supply of the market throughout the financial year 1964/65 means that theBritish Egg Marketing Board&apos;s average selling price will be lower than in1963/64 and again below the &quot;indicator price&quot; of 3s. 2d. per dozen. Thishas resulted in a fall in producers&apos; returns. At the same time the Exchequerbill in 1964/65 will be substantially higher.41. On the evidence of current returns of chick placings some fall inthe size of the national flock seems probable in 1965/66 (though yieldsper hen should continue to increase) and a closer balance between supplies and demand than in 1964/65 is in prospect. Nevertheless, the increase inyields and other improvements in method, occurring with most classes of eggproducers, should ensure a continuing reduction in costs of production, and accordingly there remains the risk of over-production in future. TheGovernment are therefore reducing the guaranteed price by Id. per dozen.Cereals42. The total area under cereals has continued to show a strong upward trend and in 1964 increased by over 400,000 acres to reach a level of nearly8-5 million acres. The wheat acreage recovered after a fall in 1963 and thebarley acreage showed a further considerable gain ; the acreage sown to oatscontinued to decline. Yields in 1964 were good. Total production in 1964/65is considerably above the previous highest level attained, in 1962/63, and the combined production of wheat and barley is estimated to be some 1-2 million tons in excess of the standard quantities. Market prices this year have beenlower than in 1963/64. The Exchequer cost of support in 1965/66, not-withstanding the operation of the standard quantities, is expected to rise to 76 million compared with  63 million in 1964/65.43. Despite the continued increase in the consumption of cereals bylivestock, imports of cereals will decline sharply in the current year. Underthe terms of the Agreements with overseas suppliers on minimum import prices, there is an obligation to ensure a proper balance between home production and imports, and to provide overseas suppliers as well as domestic producers with an opportunity to share in the growth of the market in afair and reasonable way. In particular an undertaking was given by theprevious Government that if there is, or threatens to be, a significant reduc-tion in imports below the level of the 3 year average up to 30th June 1964(9 million tons) effective remedial action would be taken. Imports are ex-pected to fall below this level by about 800,000 tons.13
44. In 1965/66 consumption of cereals is expected to increase further and,in accordance with the statement in the 1964 Annual Review White Paper,the Government have decided to increase the standard quantities for wheat from 3-3 to 3-4 million tons and for barley from 6-5 to 6-75 million tons. Atthe same time, having regard to the trend of production, the obligations underthe Agreements negotiated by the previous Government with the overseas suppliers, and the cost of the Exchequer subsidy, the guaranteed prices for wheat and barley will be reduced by Is. Id. and Is. 4d. respectively.45. There will be an increase in the target indicator price for wheat(Appendix VI, Part II, page 47). The increase takes account of the newHome-Grown Cereals Authority which will be in operation for the 1965/66crop year.Potatoes46. The United Kingdom acreage in 1964 was 778,000 acres which,assuming a reasonable distribution between early and main crop varieties, isabout the acreage needed to meet the current level of demand, given normalyields. There are, however, some indications of a slight fall in acreage forthe 1965 crop and the Government have decided to increase the guaranteed price by 5s. Od. per ton.47- The yield per acre from the 1964 crop was, in fact, somewhat abovenormal, and the crop seems likely to give rise to a surplus over and aboverequirements for human consumption. In view of the possibility that the guaranteed price might not be realised for the season as a whole, the Govern-ment have authorised the use of the joint Market Support Fund for supportbuying.Sugar Beet48. In view of the termination of the South African Sugar agreement on 31st December 1964 the contract acreage was reviewed in September1964 and the acreage to which the guarantee will apply in 1965 was increasedby 7,500 acres to 442,850. This followed an increase of 20,750 acres for1964. The increase in acreage, rounded up to 443,000 acres, will be con-tinued for the 1966 crop; and, in order to maintain production, the price for the 1965 crop for beet of 16 per cent, sugar content will be increased by2s. 6d. a ton.Production Grants49. The Government have reviewed the production grants. They havedecided to introduce a number of new ones and to make important changes in existing grants. The object is to give greater emphasis to the improvementof management and productivity. In particular, more help will be given to small farmers whose holdings are capable of providing a reasonable full-timelivelihood and to farmers in hill and upland areas.50. Small Farmer Schemes. As explained in paragraph 9 above, theGovernment wish to give further encouragement to improving the businessmanagement of small farms, and have therefore decided to revise the small farmer Schemes which have been basically unchanged since their inceptionin 1959.   The revised Schemes will come into operation in the early
2 3autumn. Farm Business Plans submitted ins the meantime willcontinue to be dealt with under the present Schemes. Payment of grant underthe revised Schemes will depend upon the farmer submitting and implementinga three-year farm management programme to increase the productivity andprofitability of the business. An essential part of the programme will be the keeping and using cf farm records as a basis for farm management decisions.Farmers will be eligible for grants at the end of each of the three years of theprogramme at rates varying with the acreage of crops and grass on the farm.The maximum total grant for any one farm business will be  1,000. Theupper limits of eligibility for farm businesses under the revised Schemes willbe increased to 125 acres of crops and grass (as compared with 100 acres atpresent) and a standard labour requirement of 600 standard man-days (ascompared with the present 500). The man-day figures, however, will be calculated on a more up-to-date basis to take account of the rise in labour productivity since the original Schemes were introduced. (On this basis 600standard man-days is roughly equivalent to 700 standard man-days on ihepresent basis of calculation.) As a result of these extensions the additionalnumber of farm businesses eligible in the United Kingdom is estimated to beabout 40,000. It is intended that the revised Schemes should be availablefor those farm businesses which have not already benefited under the presentSchemes.51. Agricultural Credit. The Government have decided to extend to agriculture the provision already made for horticulture under section 9 of the agriculture and Horticulture Act 1964. Certain financial institutions will be offered financial backing so that they may more readily give guarantees tothe banks for the repayment in due course of short and medium-term bankloans made to farmers and also to farmers&apos; co-operatives and groups to theextent that they are marketing primary farm produce. As a result of theseguarantees the banks would be likely to accept a larger number of applicantsof sound credit status who may lack the more tangible forms of security. Itis a feature of guarantee arrangements of this kind that a small grant-in-aidcan support a considerable volume of new lending.52. Agricultural Co-operation. The Government are extending to agri-culture the provision already available to horticulture under section 4 of the agriculture and Horticulture Act 1964 for one-third grants to co-operativesSand groups marketing primary farm produce to help them add to theirworking capital so as to expand their business. The creation of new marketingco-operatives and groups will also be aided in this way. It will be a condition that the members must subscribe at least an equal amount of new capital oftheir own. Under these arrangements and those in paiagraph 51 the groupseligible will be those with a co-operative type of constitution.53. Farm Business Recording Scheme. In order to extend encourage-ment for record-keeping to farmers who are not eligible for the revised small farmer Schemes the Government also propose to pay grants to farmers for aperiod of three years to encourage the keeping of farm business records. Therate proposed would be equivalent to 75 per cent, of the estimated cost of keeping records, subject however to a maximum grant of  100. It is intendedto introduce pilot schemes in certain limited areas during 1965 and to extendthem in the following year. Details will be announced as soon as possible.15
54. Hill Farming. The Government intend to give more aid to farmers inthe hill areas. Under present arrangements, a variable hill sheep subsidy is paid in some years and not in others, in accordance with assessments madeeach year of the economic circumstances of hill sheep farmers in the preceding year. The Government have decided to put the scheme on a flat rate basis.Subsidy will be paid each year, at a rate sufficient to cover the normalvariations in weather conditions from year to year. The rate will be 18s.per eligible ewe compared with an average of 9s. 6d. over the last 5 years.55. The hill cow subsidy will be increased to  13 per eligible hill cowand, as an incentive to hill farmers to continue to improve the stockingcapacity of their land, the maximum stocking ratio introduced in the 1964schemes for England, Wales and Northern Ireland is being raised from onecow per six acres to one cow per five acres of eligible land.56. As already announced, the present Winter Keep Scheme in England,Wales and Northern Ireland will be replaced by arrangements for payingwinter keep grants in the form of supplements to the hill cow and hill sheepsubsidies. These supplements will be at the rate of  5 for hill cows and 3s. 6d.for hill ewes. Scotland will retain the existing Winter Keep Scheme, whichis on an acreage basis, but in order to ensure comparability with other areas inthe United Kingdom the acreage payment will be supplemented by a grant of. Od. per hill ewe.57. Calf Subsidy. The existing Calf Subsidy Scheme will be replaced assoon as possible by new arrangements under which subsidy can be claimedeither as at present when the animal is still a calf (Stage A) or after the finished animal has been slaughtered for beef (Stage B). Subsidy at Stage Awill be subject to the same conditions of breed, sex and age as the presentcalf subsidy, but at Stage B any steer or heifer born in the United kingdom will be eligible provided it is certified on a deadweight basis as eligible for thefatstock guarantee, and provided that payment has not already been made on it at Stage A.58. The rates of calf subsidy (Stage A of the new arrangements) will beincreased by 10s. Od. a head in respect of calves born on or after 1st January&apos;1965. Payments at Stage B cannot begin until later this year, and anannouncement of the starting date will be made in due course. The intention is to pay the same rate per head whether the subsidy is claimed on a calf oron a beef carcase.59. Fertiliser Subsidy. The consumption of fertilisers has continued toincrease and at the present rates of subsidy the Exchequer cost is forecast torise in the financial year 1965/66 to about  32-3 million. The Governmenthave decided to abate the rates of subsidy from 1st June 1965 so as to reducethe total annual subsidy by an estimated  2 million.60. Lime Subsidy. The former percentage grant system was replaced lastAugust by the flat rates of contribution specified in the schedules to theAgricultural Lime Scheme 1964. The annual cost to the Exchequer underthe new Scheme has continued to be about  9 million (Appendix V, TableA, page 39). The Government have decided to amend the rates of contribution so as to reduce the total annual subsidy by an estimated  1 million.
61. Market Development Scheme. Subject to Parliamentary approval,this is to be extended for a further three years from 31st March 1965, witha view to making use of that part of the original allocation ( IV million)so far unallocated. There will be a new provision for payment of a higher rate of grant for certain projects initiated by the Agricultural MarketingDevelopment Executive Committee (which supervises the operation of theScheme).62. Other Grants. The qualifying age of grass for the higher rate ofploughing grant (i.e.  12 per acre) will in future remain constant at 12 years,but land on which this grant has previously been paid will be ineligible. the closing date for applications for grant under the Silo Subsidy Scheme willbe extended for one final year to 31st July 1966.63. Northern Ireland Special Assistance Grant. Since the decontrol ofthe marketing of agricultural produce in 1954 the Government of NorthernIreland have received an annual payment (special assistance grant) fromthe United Kingdom Exchequer to offset the financial disadvantage whichNorthern Ireland farmers suffer because of their remoteness from the mainmarkets in Great Britain. The special assistance grant was last reviewed in 1962 and fixed at  1  million a year. The Government propose to review the grant again during the coming year.64. The Ministry of Agriculture for Northern Ireland are giving furtherconsideration to ways of using the special assistance grant and will shortly beconsulting the Ulster Farmers&apos; Union on proposals for setting up an Agri-cultural Trust, to be financed from the special assistance grant, with theobject of promoting greater efficiency in marketing and of expanding thehome and export markets for Northern Ireland produce.IV.  Effect of Determinations65. The determinations now made will add rather more than  10 million tothe total value of the price guarantees and production grants.66. In reaching their conclusions the Government have had in mind the marked improvement in the industry&apos;s income since 1963/64, both actualand on a normal weather basis. It is recognised that this year cost increases have been substantial, but the Government consider that, in the presentcircumstances of the national economy, the industry should, like others, beexpected to absorb a large part of its increased costs through its increasing productivity. The net income of the industry depends on many other thingsbesides the level of the price guarantees and production grants, but, in the government&apos;s view, the present determinations will give the industry theopportunity of improving its income in the coming year.67. The Government have given careful consideration to the needsof the different commodities and in this connection have taken fully intoaccount their international obligations. They have also looked carefullyat the various sectors of the industry, and believe that their decisions will givehelp where it is most needed.
68. Finally, the contribution which agriculture can best make to national economic growth will be considered as part of the national economic develop-ment plan. But through their decisions, the Government have made a starton the longer-term agricultural developments described in Part I. they believe that these, together with the further measures which are to be con-sidered for improving the structural efficiency of agriculture, developing hilland upland areas, and widening agricultural co-operation are of great import-ance for the future. As these measures come into effect they should enablethe industry to improve still further its productivity and so its remuneration.

Net income can be defined asthe reward for the manual and managerial labour of the farmer and his wife, and fordie use of the occupier&apos;s investment.NOTE. The revised figures given in Tables A and C of this Appendix for the year1963/64 replace the forecasts which were published in last year&apos;s White Paper whenthe outcome for the latter part of that year was not known. In addition new statistical information which has become available affects the figures for 1963/64 and earlier years.   Forecasts for 1964/65 are as at mid-January, 1965.
Note (ii). These two series of aggregate farming net income are calculated in fundamentally different ways. The &quot; Departmental&quot; estimate is built up from the statistics of income and expenditure for the whole &quot; national&quot; farm, whereas the&quot; raised sample &quot; is based on some 3,700 actual farm accounts, which are expanded or &quot; raised &quot; to give an aggregate for all farms in the United Kingdom. There area number of reasons why the levels of aggregate net income shown in these two series should vary but it is difficult to make a quantitative assessment of the individualcauses.  Both series are of value in indicating the general trend in the level of income.Note (iii). The figures for aggregate net income in Table A include as profit inrecent years about  8 million on the production of food for consumption in the farmhousehold. In other industries the corresponding sums are not treated as profit andare relatively much smaller (in many cases non-existent).Note (iv). From the figures for aggregate net income in Table A certain sumsshould have been appropriated by farmers to cover the excess of replacement cost over original cost of certain assets (slaughter stock, cultivations, growing crops, etc.)used up in the course of the year&apos;s production and trade.

Note (/). The figures for years up to and including 1963/64 represent actual expenditure recorded in the Appropriation Accounts. The figures for 1964/65 are thelatest estimates (Hansard, 5th February, 1965, cols. 339-340) of cash expenditure inthe United Kingdom (Civil Estimates Class V, votes 3, 4, 5 and 6). The figures for1965/66 are based on the Civil Estimates now before the House of Commons and donot take account of the determinations in this White Paper (see however Note (viii)).Note iii). Payments in respect of cereals, potatoes and wool relate partly to the crops or clip of the year indicated and partly to the crops or clips of the preceding year or years.Note (iii). Figures for milk exclude expenditure on school and welfare milk.Following the 1962 Annual Review the retail price of milk was arranged so that neither a deficiency nor a surplus will arise, taking one year with another, from the implementation of the price guarantee.Note (iv). Expenditure on Tuberculosis Eradication relates to Bonus payments under the Attested Herds Scheme only and excludes compensation payments forslaughtered reactors.Note (v). The item &quot; other grants &quot; includes grants to producers in the ScottishIslands, rabbit clearance societies, improvement of livestock, bracken eradication and machinery syndicates.Note (vi). The following are relevant production grants for the purposes of the agriculture Act, 1957, and the Annual Review: Fertilisers subsidy.Lime subsidy.Ploughing grants.Grassland renovation.Winter keep.Field drainage grants for ditching and moling (estimated cost  0-6 million in1964/65; figure in the Table includes expenditure on tiling schemes).Marginal Production Assistance grants.Bonus payments under the Tuberculosis (Attested Herds) Scheme.Calf subsidy.Hill cattle and hill cow subsidies.Hill sheep subsidy (as from the 1965 Annual Review).Silo subsidies.Grants to small farmers.Grants to producers in the Scottish Islands.Grants to rabbit clearance societies.Arrangements for the benefit of agricultural producers in Northern Irelandfinanced from the U.K. Exchequer.Grants for agricultural marketing development (estimated cost in 1964/65  0-2 million).Note (vii). The Table excludes the grants for agricultural marketing development projects mentioned in Note (vi) above.  It also excludes grants to horticulturalists.Note (viii). On the basis of the original assumptions as to output and market prices the estimated effect of the determinations set out in this White Paper, togetherwith the proposed increase in the retail price of milk, is a net reduction of about l*m. in the total estimated cost ( 294+m.) of agricultural support by the exchequer in 1965/66. This net reduction is the result broadly of decreases of  lm. on wheat, 5m. on barley,  3m. on eggs and  14-m. on production grants and increases of  5m.on cattle and  4m. on pigs.The figures do not include the effect on deficiency payments of any changes in output during the year which may be ascribed to Review changes.The net effect of the determinations on the Estimates differs from the effect on thevalue of the guarantees for several reasons; the more important are that the priceguarantee arrangements for some commodities do not involve Exchequer payments and that the payment periods for some items do not correspond with the financialyear.

The figures for cereals arc in respect of grain taken into account in the Cereals Deficiency PaymentsSchemes and relate to crop years. For 1957/58 onward the market value for barley is related to all barleys; inthe previous year it related only to the lower priced barleys defined in the 1956 Scheme.Note (iii).

Because marketings and prices of fatstock and wheatmay vary from those forecast, producers&apos; average returns under the guarantees for those products in any year may differ slightly from the guaranteed prices.(b) The guaranteed price for pigs is subject to the flexible guarantee arrangement described in Part II of this Appendix.(c) The guaranteed price for milk includes 0-25d. per gallon special assistance forcompositional quality.id) The guaranteed price for barley is subject to arrangements whereby, to encourage amore even spread of marketings over the season, the deficiency payments are subject topremiums for barley delivered, after sale, in the later months of the cereal year and deductionsfor barley delivered in the early months of the year.
Part II.  Additional Details of guarantees. The guaranteed prices shov/n in Part I of this Appendix for livestock and livestock products in 1965/66 and for crops of the 1965 harvest will be on a similar basis tothose for the previous year except as stated in the following paragraphs.Milk2. The provisional standard quantity for each area in 1965/66 will be calculated as follows:Million gallonsEngland and WalesMain Scottish AreaAberdeen and DistrictNorth of ScotlandNorthern IrelandProvisional		ProvisionalStandard		standard quantity,		Quantity,1964165	Change	1965/661,772-3	plus 19-9	1,792-2186-9	plus 1 - 7	188-6200	plus 0-1	20-19-9	no change	9-999-3	plus 0-9	100-22,088-4	plus 22 - 6	2,111-03.

Ending of Quality Differential. The differential of 5s. Od. per live cwt. betweenthe rates of guarantee payment for Grade I and Grade II cattle will be discontinuedwith effect from 29th March, 1965.5. Adjustment of Seasonal Scale. With effect from 29th March, 1965 the seasonalscale of weekly standard prices will be adjusted so as to reduce the level of prices byup to 3s. Od. per live cwt. over the period December to early June. Compensatingincreases will be made over the rest of the year so as to maintain a guaranteed priceof 174s. Od. per live cwt.6. Graduated Deficiency Payments Scheme. With effect from 29th March, 1965,the scale of abatements and supplements will be adjusted. If the average market price for a week is below the standard price for the same week, and the deficiency is within the range 8s. 0d.-12s. Od. per live cwt., a guarantee payment of the amount ofthis deficiency will be paid in respect of the week: but if the deficiency in the weekexceeds 12s. Od. per cwt., or is less than 8s. Od. per cwt., the guarantee payment willbe subject to abatement or supplement in accordance with scales determined at the review, which are being published separately.Fat Sheep7. Adjustment of Seasonal Scale. With effect from 29th March, 1965, the seasonalscale of weekly standard prices will be adjusted so as to reduce the level of prices by-jd. per lb. over the period August to mid-November. Compensating increases willbe made over the rest of the year so as to maintain a guaranteed price of 3s. 2d. per lb.. estimated dressed carcase weight.8. Graduated Deficiency Payments Scheme. With effect from 29th March, 1965,the scale of abatements and supplements will be adjusted.   If the average market
price for a week is below the standard price for the same week, and the deficiency is within the range 2$d.-4d. per lb. estimated dressed carcase weight, a guaranteepayment of the amount of this deficiency will be paid in respect of the week: but ifthe deficiency in the week exceeds 4d. per lb. or is less than 2+d. per lb., the guaranteepayment will be subject to abatement or supplement in accordance with scalesdetermined at the Review, which are being published separately.Fat Pigs9. Flexible Guarantee Scale. The flexible guarantee scale (set out in paragraph 17of Appendix VI, Part II of the 1964 Annual Review White Paper) will be modifiedand with effect from 29th March, 1965, the scale will be as follows: Adjustment to the forecast level of certifications basic guaranteed price10-4 million or more but less than 10-8 million     ... -f 3s.   6d.4- 2s.   3d.-f Is.  6d.-h       9d.Basic guaranteed price9d.- Is.   6d.- 2s.   3d.- 3s.   6d.10-8 ,,     ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, 11-2 ,,11*2 ,,      ,, ,, ,, ,, ,,11-6 ,,11-6 ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, 120 ,,12-0 ,,      ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, 12-8P-8 13-213-2 ,, ,, ,, ,, 13-6 ,,13-6 ,,      ,, ,, ,, ,, 140 ,,14-0 ,,      ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, 14-4 ,,There will be a further adjustment of Is. 3d. for each complete 0-4 million or part thereof by which the forecast annual level of certifications falls below 10-4 million or exceeds 14-4 million.10. Stabilising Arrangements. With effect from 29th March, 1965, stabilisingarrangements for &quot; bacon pigs &quot; and &quot; other pigs &quot; will be discontinued and thestabilising limits which will apply in calculating the average return to producers forall pigs will be 3s. Od. per score above and 2s. Od. per score below the standard price.11. Quality Premiums. With effect from 29th March, 1965, the rates of qualitypremium will be reduced to 2s. Od. per score for pigs graded AA+ and Is. Od. perscore for pigs graded AA.Hen and Duck Eggs: Indicator Price System12. In 1965/66 the indicator prices provided for by Article 4 of the Eggs (guaranteed prices) Order, 1963 (1963 No. 569) as amended by the Eggs (Guaranteed Prices)(Amendment) Order, 1964 (1964 No. 462) will be 3s. 2d. per dozen for hen eggs and2s. 2d. per dozen for duck eggs. If, during 1965/66, the British Egg MarketingBoard&apos;s average selling price for hen or duck eggs is below the appropriate indicatorprice, the proportion of the difference to be met by the Exchequer will be reduced from 50 per cent, to 40 per cent, in accordance with the arrangements set out in theabove mentioned Orders.Cereals13. Standard quantities. The standard quantities for wheat and barley will be asfollows:thousand tonsStandard QuantityChange for 1965 HarvestWheat............ -f 100 3,400Barley............ + 250 6,75014. Target Indicator Prices. The target indicator prices for wheat and barley willbe as follows:per cwt.Target Indicator PriceChange for 1965 HarvestWheat............ 4- 6d. 20s.   6d.Barley............ No change 19s.   Od.
If a change should be made in the course of the cereal year in the relevant minimum import prices, an identical change would be made in the target indicator price, andan average target indicator price for the cereal year would be used throughout the calculations.15. Escalator arrangement. The escalator arrangement will operate within a range of production of 3-2 to 3-4 million tons for wheat and 6-3 to 6-75 million tons forbarley (subject to any adjustments consequent on the crop adjustment formula).Sugar Beet16. For the 1965 crop the maximum acreage to which the guarantee will applywill be 427,250 acres in England and Wales and 15,600 acres in Scotland. Themaximum acreage for the 1966 crop will be the same as in 1965 except that the acreage for England and Wales will be rounded up to 427,400 acres.(32565)   Wt. 1124-490   K11S   3/65   St.S.
