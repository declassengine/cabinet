SECRET169DRAFT PARLIAMENTARY STATEMENT ON THE&quot;VOTE ON ACCOUNT7lrith permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a statement about Supply expenditure in 1965-66.2.       The House will recall that in my Budget Statement of11th November last I said, with reference to public expenditure,that the Governments first objective was to get the deployment ofeconomic resources right.    The presentation of the Vote onAccount affords me an opportunity to report on progress.3.       The Vote on Account, covering the Civil Estimates and theDefence (Central) Estimate, is being published this afternoon;  theDefence Estimates and the Defence White Paper will be publishedtomorrow.    The total estimated Supply expenditure in 1965-66 is 7, 134 million, an increase of  585 million or 8.9 per cent overthe Budget Estimates for the current year.     Of this,   247 million or 3.8 per cent is attributable to increases in prices.    The figureof 8.9 per cent compares with increases in the three previous yearsof 6. 7 per cent. , 9.4 per cent and 8.2 per cent respectively,4.       The Defence Budget Estimates, at  2, 120 million v/ill chowan increase of  121 million.    Apart from pay and price increasesthis represents an increase of 2.3 per cent over 1964-65 as againsta comparable increase of 5.5 per cent, in the previous year.    we attach a high priority to tightening control of the Defence Budget;the Estimates will show that we have made a start.    Moreover,defence expenditure bears heavily upon the balance of payments,and this aspect is the subject of a special review.    The needs ofour forces must be met at a cost which the country can afford andthe Defence White Paper will explain the measures we are taking to achieve this.5.       The Estimates show an increase over last year although they have been severely pruned.    In large part, they are the outcome of a long series of decisions going back over a period of years duringthe time when right honourable Gentlemen opposite were in office.My colleagues and I are determined to cut out unnecessary spending;but because moot policy decisions imply a long-term programme of spending, Government expenditure cannot be re-shaped at short-1-SECRET

-4 f*r* t?m ---170notice.    As we made clear in the Statement on the Economic Situationwhich was issued on 26th October last, it is the Government^ viewthat the expenditure programmes which we inherited do not provideadequately for the nation!s economic or social needs and we intend to reshape them.6.      Moreover, my examination shows that the commitmentsenshrined in these Estimates were embarked upon by the previous administration without proper attention being paid to our capacity to finance them.    The Government intend to be more prudent inthese matters;  and we have accordingly been considering theproblem of planning the long-term course not only of CentralGovernment expenditure but of the total expenditure of the wholepublic sector.    This total must be viewed against the economicresourres likely to be available.    It is the Governmenfs task to plan the purposive use of our economic resources as a whole, inorder to secure, first, that total expenditure both public and privatematches the resources that can be made available, and, second,that within the total there is a proper balance between the require-ments of the public and private sectors.    This means that the public sector may need to absorb a larger share of our gross national product than it does today.    But the growth of public expendituremust be effectively controlled so that it can be accommodated,along with the other major elements, in the National economic development Plan which the Government are preparing.7.      A final decision on the details of this will be reached whenthe Plan has been drawn up.    Meanwhile, the Government havedecided that the growth of public sector expenditure betv/een 1964-65and 1969-70, excluding the investment of the nationalised industries,shall be related to the prospective increase in national production,which in our present judgment means limiting the average increasein public sector expenditure to 4^: per cent a year at constant prices.Taking one year with another, we intend to plan our policies in sucha way as to ensure that this rate of growth shall not be exceeded.8.       This plan for public expenditure marks a further development in our long-term programme.    It will provide a sound base for our policies for modernising and expanding the national resources.    Itwill also permit the progressive development of our economic and social policies, because expenditure will be realistically related toour capacity to embark upon new plans.
