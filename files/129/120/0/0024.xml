SECRET160THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJES TY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(65) 2417th February, 1965CABINETVOTE ON ACCOUNT, 1965-66Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Vote on Account will be presented and published on22nd February.    It will reveal that the 1965-66 Estimates to be presented to Parliament will total  7,134 million.    This is anincrease of 8. 9 per cent in money terms, or 5. 5 per cent in real terms.This is large, though not the largest increase on record.But for reasons which are known to my colleagues, the situation isparticularly sensitive this year; and I am accordingly anxious thatwe should do what we can to reduce the adverse impact which theincrease may have on home and overseas opinion.I therefore propose, exceptionally, to introduce this year!sVote on Account by making a statement in the House on the day it is published.    I attach a draft of the proposed statement.There is one point on the defence figures in the draft statement to which I would draw particular attention.    Allowing for the  13-14 million for service housing which will not appear on Votes,we shall in real terms be exceeding in 1965-66 the  2, 000 millionlimit by nearly  60 million or 3 per cent.    If we are to achieve the objective which we have agreed upon, this is not a trend which we can afford to allow to continue.I invite my colleagues to agree that I shall make a statement in the House on 22nd February on the lines of the attached draft.L.

2iS\C b161DRAFT PARLIAMENTARY STATEMENT ONTHE VOTE ON ACCOUNTWith permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a statement about Supply expenditure in 1965-66,The Vote on Account, covering the Civil Estimates and theDefence (Central) Estimate, was published earlier this afternoon;the Defence Estimates and the Defence White Paper will bepublished tomorrow.    The total estimated Supply expenditure in1965-66 is  7,134 million, an increase of  585 million or 8.9 percent over the Budget Estimates for the current year.    This figurecompares with increases in the three previous years of 6.7 percent, 9.4 per cent and 8.2 per cent respectively.    In real terms the increase is 5.5 per cent.The Defence Budget Estimates at  2, 120 million will showan increase of  121 million, which in real terms is an increase of2.3 per cent over 1964-65.    This compares with an increase of5.5 per cent in real terms in the previous year.    The needs of our forces must be met at a cost which the country can afford and theDefence White Paper will explain the measures we are taking to achieve this.The Estimates show an increase over last year although theyhave been severely pruned.  My colleagues and I are determined to cut out unnecessary spending, but Government expenditure is not susceptible to downward changes at short notice.    In large part,therefore, the Estimates for which I now take responsibility are the outcome of a long series of decisions going back over a period ofyears during the time when right honourable Gentlemen oppositewere in office.    As we made clear in the Statement on the EconomicSituation which was issued on 26th October last, it is theGovernments view that the expenditure programmes which weinherited do not provide adequately for the nation&apos;s economic or social needs and we intend to reshape them.Moreover, my examination shows that the policiesenshrined in these Estimates were embarked upon by the previous administration without proper attention being paid to our capacity to finance them.    I intend that we should be more prudent in these

g* 17&quot; j?* EESImatters.    The Government have accordingly been studying theproblem of controlling the long-term trend not only of CentralGovernment expenditure but of the total expenditure of the wholepublic sector.    This total must be viewed against the economic resources likely to be available.    It does not follow that the public sector should not be allowed to take a larger share of our gross national product than it does today.    I do say, however, that thegrowth of public expenditure must be consciously and effectivelyplanned and controlled as the major element in the national economic Development Plan which the Government are preparing.A final decision on the details of this will be reached whenthe Plan has been drawn up.    Meanwhile, the Government havedecided that total public expenditure, excluding the investment ofthe nationalised industries, shall be allowed to rise by 23 per centin real terms between 1964-65 and 1969-70.    This represents anaverage annual increase of about 4jf per cent.    We intend to planour policies in such a way as to ensure that, taking one year with another, this rate of growth shall not be exceeded.There is one category to which I must make particular reference, namely those items in the Government expenditure programme which bear heavily upon the balance of payments.    TheGovernment are subjecting these items, which involve overseas expenditure, to special examination.This plan for public expenditure marks a further develop-ment in our long-term programme.    It will provide a sound base for our policies of modernisation and redeployment of the national resources.    It will also permit the progressive development ofour economic and social policies, because expenditure will berealistically related to our capacity to embark upon new plans.
