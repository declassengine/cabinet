SECRET -     186HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY !3 GOVERNMENT)C.(65) 33 COPY NO.    3 323rd February.. 1965CABINETHOUSINGMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer have seen the three papers submitted by the Minister of housing and Local Government and the Minister of Public Building and Works onthe points which were raised at our previous discussion on 11th February(C. C.(65) 9th Conclusions, Minute 3).2.       The issue now seems to be a straightforward one.    The Ministerwanted to make 156, 000 approvals (local authority and New Towns) in1965.    I said that I was prepared to accept 144, 000,    The difference is12, 000 which at an average of  3, 000 a house represents an increasedpublic expenditure of  36 million (some in 1965-66 and some in 1966-67).3.      If we increase the public demand on resources in this way wemust simultaneously reduce the private demand by the same amount,except insofar as we can call into use regional pockets of unemployedman-power and other resources.    Unfortunately, the extent to which wecan rely on this is severly limited.    I recognise that there may becapacity for fabricating and setting up industrialised housing in areas where there is unemployment.    But the materials and components forthese houses are bound to be drawn from all over the country, thusadding to the pressure on the supplying industries - essentially building materials and engineering components - and in turn increasing these industries&apos;demands for man-power and for other resources.4.      Hence it would only be reasonable to accept the proposed increase in public housing if we could simultaneously curtail the demandfor private housing.    But this does not appear to be possible now: mycolleagues1 papers show that we cannot introduce building controls overprivate house-building without legislation and that it is doubtful whether we could apply an effective financial control to private housing.5.       To go ahead with more public housing in these conditions would,in my view, be v/rong.    The immediate effect would be to add to theoverload on the supplying industries and to intensify the Budget problem.6.      A shift from private to public house-building would make senseif a balanced set of measures to achieve this diversion could be found.It would then be necessary to consider this change in policy in the context of our public spending programmes and the rival claims ofdifferent departments.Jo C.Treasury Chambers, S. W, 1.23rd February, 1965
