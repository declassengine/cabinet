THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. March 1965C. (65) 39 Copy No.     5 915th March, 1965CABINETBRITISH IRON AND STEEL FEDERATIONMemorandum by the Attorney-GeneralThe Ministerial Committee on Iron and Steel Nationalisationinvited me to circulate a memorandum to the Cabinet on the british iron and Steel Federation and its associated trading companies, withparticular reference to the possibilities of making provision in theBill nationalising iron and steel for taking part of the Federation^activities into public ownership or for restricting the ability of theFederation and its associated trading companies to frustrate theoperations of the nationalised sector.2. The organisation of the B.I.S.F. is extremely complicated butfor the purposes of this memorandum the relevant facts are that theactivities of the Federation, which is not itself a legal entity, are inpractice controlled by an executive committee consisting of theleading steel masters acting in a personal, and not a representative,capacity; and that, acting through nominees and a holding company(the British Iron and Steel Corporation Limited), the Federationcontrols the operations of a number of companies which trade withthe iron and steel producers. The most important of these in thepresent context is B.I.S.C. (Ore) Limited, which is responsible for theimport and resale of iron and manganese ore.3. An anomalous situation will, of course, be created if thesetrading companies are left wholly in private ownership, and subjectto the control of the steel masters, when the bulk of the industry withwhich they trade has been nationalised; and the ministerial committee have expressed some concern at the prospect that the nationalised sector should be left at the mercy of the Federation inthis way. The Committee accordingly took the view that our objectiveshould be to ensure that the central trading activities of the Federationare transferred as soon as possible to the National Steel Corporation,subject to the important proviso that the services provided by thecompanies must continue without interruption for the benefit of thewhole industry.4. I assume that my colleagues will agree that there can be noquestion of the nationalisation Bill conferring power on the Ministerto provide by regulations for the transfer of the central trading5504
services to the National Steel Corporation. A transfer of this kind,and on this scale, involves matters of major principle which, in my view, must be dealt with in a Bill and not by subordinate legislation.On that assumption, two possibilities have to be considered. The first is that the Bill should contain provisions dealing specifically with theFederation or the trading companies or both; the second is that theBill should contain provisions in general terms applying to theFederation or the companies without making specific reference tothem.5. The inclusion in a Bill in this session of any provisions dealingspecifically with the Federation and its trading companies should, inmy view, be ruled out at once. Provisions of this kind would have tobe dealt with in accordance with the Standing Orders relating to private Bills, the procedure under which gives considerableopportunity for obstruction and can be extremely slow. In particular,it would give an opportunity to the steel companies with which theBill deals to claim a right to be heard by the Select Committee. Evenif the House of Commons could be persuaded to suspend theoperation of the relevant Standing Orders so as to avoid this result,there is, I understand, no possibility that the House of Lords would agree to do so.6. We must also rule out any provisions in general terms dealingsolely with the Federation. A provision which, without naming theFederation, applied to it and to no other trade association (and weshould not want to deal with any other trade association in the same way) would have to be dealt with under the Private Bill procedure inthe same way as if it expressly named the Federation.7. There remains, therefore, the possibility of dealing with thecentral trading companies by provisions drawn in general terms. such provisions would be extremely artificial (in that they would have to describe the activities of companies which could very easily be named)but, although this is not a matter upon which one can speak with any degree of confidence, I understand that it might be possible for themto be drawn in such a way as not to attract the Private Bill procedure.8. There are, however, substantial objections to dealing withthe problem in this way, largely because our knowledge of theramifications of the organisation of the Federation and its subsidiariesis far from complete. The nationalisation Bill will confer powers of acquiring information that will enable us to improve our knowledge,but as the law now stands we cannot be sure that, if the Corporationacquired the companies, it would not also be acquiring liabilitiesabout which we have at present no information. Even more to thepoint, we could not be sure that the acquisition of the tradingcompanies would not interrupt the operation of the central trading services or even that it would effectively frustrate the activities of theFederation if its executive committee were minded to obstruct theoperations of the nationalised sector. In short, we cannot be sure thata transfer of the central trading activities of the Federation at thisstage would be effective; and it might well do some harm.
9. In these circumstances, it seems to me clear that it would bea mistake to attempt to deal with the Federation in a Bill in this session. Although, like my colleagues on the Ministerial Committee,I have come to this conclusion with reluctance, it should be borne inmind that the failure to deal with the Federation now will notnecessarily lead to any harmful results. The Corporation will, after all,be the principal customer of the trading companies and it will havea strong position on the conferences which constitute the Federationitself; and, on the other hand, however suspicious we may be of the steel masters (and the events of 1951 give good grounds for suspicion)we have at this stage no positive evidence of any intention to use theFederation to frustrate the operations of the nationalised sector.F.
