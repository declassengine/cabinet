IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)59C.(65) 47 COPY NO.23rd March, 1965CABINETPRICES AND INCOMESNote by the First Secretary of State and secretary of State for Economic affairs my colleagues will wish to know of the progress that has beenmade with the third stage of the development of our policy for prices and incomes.2.      I have discussed with the T. U. C. and with the four nationalemployers&apos; organisations what should be the criteria governing the behaviour of prices and incomes and what should be regarded as the incomes &quot;norm&quot; - i.e. the average annual rate of increase in money incomes which is consistent with the aims of the Joint Statement of intent and which should be exceeded only in exceptional circumstances.After lengthy and at times quite difficult negotiations, I have reached agreement with the leaders on both sides on the memorandum attachedwhich I circulated to my colleagues on E. D. (p. I. ) last week /E. D. (P. I.)(65) 327,3.      This memorandum was discussed at a special meeting of theNational Economic Development Council on 22nd March when it was approved (without textual amendment) and the various interests under-took to recommend it for endorsement by their governing bodies,4.       The memorandum will now be submitted for approval by thegoverning bodies of the Trades Union Congress and the national association of British Manufacturers on 24th March, and of theFederation of British Industries, the British Employers&apos; Confederationand the Association of British Chambers of Commerce on 7th April.It will also come before a special conference of Trade Union Executiveson 30th April.5.      If, as I confidently expect, the memorandum is approved by thefive governing bodies, I propose to announce the fact in a statement inthe House of Commons on 8th April and to publish the text in a white paper.6.      It can fairly be said that the memorandum in its final form begssome questions and ignores others.    I think however that the important thing is to have reached agreement in a relatively short space of time on a document which:--1-

(a) sets out the main considerations which we believe to be relevant;(b) sets a strict limit on arguments which can be advanced in support of claims for exceptional treatment for either prices or incomes;(c) enunciates an agreed incomes &quot;norm&quot; at a level(3-3-1 per cent) which reflects current economicrealities.It is intended that the considerations set out in the document should help all concerned with determining prices and incomes to act in a manner consistent with the national interest and I hope that both sides of industry will give the widest publicity to the document when it is published.    I am sure it will also provide a useful starting point forthe work of the National Board for Prices and Incomes and will serve as a foundation on which a body of case-law can be built up.G.

CONFIDcN 1IALDRAFT&apos;17WMarch, 1965.PRICES AND INCOMES policy memorandum by the Department of Economic AffairsINTRODUCTIONIn the Joint Statement of Intent on Productivity, Prices and incomes, representatives of the T.U.C. and the employers&apos;organisations have accepted that major objectives of national policy must besto ensure that British industry is dynamic and that itsprices are competitive;to raise productivity and efficiency so that real national output can increase, and to keep increases in wages,salaries and other forms of incomes in line with this increase 5to keep the general level of prices stable.2.     They have also agreed with the Governmenfs proposals, setout in the White Paper on Machinery of Prices and Incomes Policy(Cmnd. 2577) that;(i) the National Economic Development Council should keep under review the general movement of prices and ofmoney incomes of all kinds;     and(ii) a National Board for Prices and Incomes should be setup to examine particular cases in order to advise whether;or not the behaviour of prices or of wages, salaries orother money incomes is in the national interest as defined by the Government after consultation withManagement and Unions.Trends in national. prjjducjtiyitv3.     The figure for the growth of the economy between 1964- and1970 which is being assumed in the preparation of the Government&apos;plan for economic development is 25%.    This gives an average annual rate of growth of rather less than 4%.    In calculating thelong-term annual rate of growth of national production per headof the working population allowance has to be made for the growth of the total national output due to increases in the numbers ofthe working population and for short-term variations in the rateof growth which result from fluctuations in the level of demand and the level of employment.    The most recent forecasts indicatethat between 1964 and 1970 the labour force may grow, as theresult of the natural increase in the population of working age1

and the continuance of rising trends in the proportions workingor seeking work, by no more than 1-g$ over the whole period.    some further increase in the numbers employed should result from themore vigorous regional policies to which the Government is committed.4.     These assumptions imply an average annual rate of growth in output per head of something approaching 3i%.    During the early-years of the Plan period the underlying rate of growth will inevitably be below the average for the period as a whole; inaddition the rate of increase may be slowed dovm by reductions in working hours and extension of holidays.    By comparison the underlying rate of growth per head in the nineteen-fiftiesaveraged about 2$ a year.    It is now probably about Y/o.Considerations of the national interest5.     Against this background the Government have now drawn up,after consultation with Management and Unions, a statement of considerations which should be taken into account if the pricing policy of individual enterprises and increases in money incomesare to conform to the national interest and in particular to achieve the objectives set out in paragraph 1 above.    these considerations are outlined below.    They will help all those concerned with determining prices and incomes to act in a mannerconsistent with the national interest.    They are also intendedto guide the National Board for Prices and Incomes in itsexamination of particular cases.Considerations affecting prices6,     The development of an effective policy for keeping thegeneral level of prices stable vail call for considerable efforts on the part of management generally to increase efficiency, avoidcost increases and wherever possible to stabilise or reduce prices.The rate of change of the average level of prices over any periodof time is determined by differing movements of a very largenumber of individual prices.    Even when the average level of price is rising, there are many prices which fall.    It would beimpossible to lay down detailed rules which would cover all thecircumstances which individual enterprises face when deciding theprices to ask for their products.    On the other hand, unless some general guidance is given on the circumstances in which it mightbe appropriate to raise or reduce prices, there will be no basis for deciding whether individual price decisions are consistent with the national objectives.    The considerations set out in para-graphs 9-10 are for the guidance of all concerned with the deter-mination of prices.2

7.     It is not intended that the considerations set out in para-graphs 9-10 should inhibit the structural changes that will benecessary in the interests of faster economic growth.    These take account of the fact that competition has an important part to play-in stimulating economic expansion, and are consistent with thesmooth working of a competitive system.    It should be a normalpart of enterprising business behaviour to increase efficiency,keep down costs and hold prices at a level compatible with its long-term growth.    This wo til d speed up the replacement of oldtechniques and out-of-date equipment by new techniques and modern equipment.    Moreover, the considerations recognise not only thatan enterprise must make sufficient profit to secure the capitalnecessary to meet home and overseas demand, but also that thevigorous and efficient enterprise can reasonably expect a higher level of profit than one that is not.-8.     These considerations apply equally to the prices of goods andof services whether provided by private or public enterprise.    TheGovernment regard the nationalised industries as being under thesame obligations as private enterprises to contribute to the generalobjective of price stability, while taking account of their financial and social obligations.Criteria for price behaviour9.     To keep the general level of prices stable, it is vital that price increases should be avoided where possible and that prices should be reduced wherever circumstances permit.    Enterprises willnot be expected to raise their prices except in the followingcircumstancesi-(i) if output per employee cannot be increased sufficiently to allow wages and salaries to increase at a rateconsistent with the criteria for incomes stated inparagraph 15 below without some increase in prices,and no offsetting reductions can be made in non-labour costs per unit of output or in the return sought on investment;(ii) if there are unavoidable increases in non-labour costssuch as materials, fuel services or marketing costs per unit of output which cannot be offset by reductions in labour or capital costs per unit of output or in thereturn sought on investment;(iii) if there are unavoidable increases in capital costs per unit of output Which cannot be offset by reductions in non--capital costs per unit of output or in the returnsought on investment;3

(iv) if, after every effort has been made to reduce costs,the enterprise is unable to secure the capital requiredto meet home and overseas demand.10.    Enterprises will he expected to reduce their prices in thefollowing circumstancess-(i) if output per employee is increasing faster than therate of increase in wages and salaries which is consistent with the criteria for incomes stated inparagraph 15 below, and there are no offsetting andunavoidable increases in non-labour costs per unit of output;(ii) if the costs of materials, fuel or services per unit of output are falling and there are no offsetting andunavoidable increases in labour or capital costs per unit of output;(iii) if capital costs per unit of output are falling andthere are no offsetting and unavoidable increases in non--capital costs per unit of output;(iv) if profits are based on excessive market power.Consji.derations affecting incomes policy11.    The development of an effective policy for keeping increases in money incomes in line with increases in real national output will call for considerable efforts on the part of unions and management and all others concerned with the determination of incomes.    The object must be to increase productivity and efficiency as rapidly as possible in order to raise real incomes and to avoid, wherever possible, increases in money incomes thatpush up costs and prices.    An important step will be to lay down a &quot;norm&quot; indicating the average rate of annual increase of money incomes per head which is consistent with stability in the general level of prices.    In present circumstances the appropriate figure for this purpose is 3-3ir per cent,    This would be subject tore-examination by the Government in the light of reviews to be conducted from time to time by N.S.D.C.Employment incomes12.   Wages and salaries are determined by many factors, includingchanges in the supply and demand for different kinds of labour,trends in productivity and profits, comparisons with levels ortrends of incomes in other employments and changes in the cost ofliving.    The weight given to these different factors varies withcircumstances.    They are also influenced by the policies which

the Government pursue in relation to the distribution of incomes.The Government in the Joint Statement of Intent on Productivity,Prices and Incomes have affirmed that their social objective isto ensure that the benefits of faster growth are distributed in away that satisfies the claims of social need and justice.      It isin that context that the following considerations are set out forthe guidance of all those concerned with the determination ofwages and salaries.13&apos;    If wages and salaries per head are to keep in step with thelong-term rate of increase in national productivity, less weightthan hitherto will have to be given to the factors mentioned inparagraph 12 and more weight will have to be given to the incomesnorm.   Moreover, in applying the norm to wages and salaries, itwill be necessary to take into account not only increases in wage and salary rates, but also increases in costs resulting fromreductions in working hours without loss of pay, from higher ratesof pay for overtime or shift work and from improvements in fringebenefits.14.    It would be impracticable and undesirable to lay down detailedrules so as to provide an indication of what changes in wages and salaries were warranted case by case.    Nor would it be desirableto inhibit the structural changes necessary in the interests Offaster growth.    However, experience has shown that in conditionsof full employment the normal processes of collective bargainingboth at national and local level can result in pay increases whichare inflationary in effect.    It is accordingly important to ensurethat increases in wages and salaries above the norm should be confined to cases in which exceptional treatment can be shown tobe required in the national interest.    These exceptional increases should be kept to a minimum, bearing in mind that they will need to be balanced by lower than average increases to other groups ifthe increase in wages and salaries over the economy as a whole isto be kept within the norm.15.    Exceptional pay increases should be confined to the followingcircumstances;-(i) where the employees concerned, for example by acceptingmore exacting work or a major change in working practices,make a direct contribution towards increasing productivity in the particular firm or industry.    Even in such casessome of the benefit should accrue to the community as awhole in the form cf lower prices;5

(ii) where it is essential in the national interest to secure a change in the distribution of manpower (or to prevent a change which would otherwise take place) and a pay increase would be both necessary and effective for thispurpose;(iii) where there is general recognition that existing wage and salary levels are too low to maintain a reasonable standard of living;(iv) where there is widespread recognition that the pay ofa certain group of workers has fallen seriously out of line with the level of remuneration for similar workand needs in the national interest to be improved.Non-employment incomes16.    Some types of non-employment incomes, for example those of farmers and landlords, are to a considerable extent determined by government policy.    The Government will,  in accordance with its general objective of price stability, have regard to the fact that increases in incomes of this type have a direct effect on theprices of goods and services.    The income of nationalised industries, local authorities, etc. accrues directly to thecommunity, but this does not mean that the prices charged by suchundertakings should not be susceptible to the general considora-tions outlined above.    The incomes of self-employed persons are animportant category of personal incomes.    They differ from those of employees in some respects, and allowance must be made for these differences.    Nevertheless, those who are responsible for dctor-mining or arc capable of influencing the incomes of self-employed persons should be guided by the considerations relating to thesettlement of incomes and, where appropriate,  to the criteria for price behaviour.    Increases in these incomes may therefore bereferred to the National Board.    The other main category of non-employment incomes is profits, a part of which is distributed inthe form of personal income to shareholders.    An effective policy for avoiding price increases and securing price reductionswherever possible should ensure that increases in profits arise from increased efficiency.    Where the growth of profits ordividends is based on excessive market power this could indicatescope for price reductions andsuch cases would be referred to theNational Board for Prices and Incomes for examination.General considerations17.    The requirement that total money incomes should rise in line with the growth of real national output does not mean that all6

forms of income should increase at the same rate.    It is necessarynot only to create the conditions in which essential structuralreadjustments can be carried out smoothly but also to promotesocial justice.    The general review of money incomes of all kindsto be carried out by the National Economic Development council will involve not only the assembly of the facts about the movementof the main categories of income - wages, salaries, income fromself-employment, profits (distributed and undistributed) andrent - but also an ^appraisal of the way the distribution of thenationo.1 income is developing under the impact of the prices and incomes policy.    The Government have pledged themselves to use their fiscal powers or other appropriate means to correct anyexcessive growth in aggregate profits as compared with the growth of total wages and salaries, after allowing for short-termfluctuations.Department of Economic Affairs,Storey&apos;s Gate,LONDON S.W.1.17th March,  1965.CONFIDENTIALN
