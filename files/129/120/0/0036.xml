THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1965C (65) 36 Copy No.       5 926th February, 1965CABINETTHE NATIONAL ARMY MUSEUMMemorandum by the Secretary of State for defence i seek the agreement of my colleagues that the National ArmyMuseum, now at Sandhurst, should be moved to a site at the RoyalHospital, Chelsea, and that the increased maintenance costs of thenew Museum should be borne by public funds.background. The National Army Museum was founded by Royal Charterin 1960 &quot; for the purpose of collecting, preserving and exhibitingobjects and records relating to the history of the Army&quot;. It is governed by a Council whose Chairman is the Minister of defence for the Army, and the cost of its administration is met from M.P.B.W.and Army Department votes. The Council includes both ex-officioand nominated Members, and the Museum itself is a registeredCharity.3. The Museum covers the period between the inauguration ofthe Militia in the 16th Century and 1914, spanning the gap betweenthe Tower of London collection and that of the Imperial WarMuseum. The collection has grown rapidly both from the generosityof private donors and by the accession of much of the formerR.U.S.I. Museum; it now contains many items of great value andsome that are unique: uniforms, trophies, pictures, documents andrelics. It has attained the status of a national collection, of interestand value well outside the Army itself: with the closing of theR.U.S.I. Museum there is indeed no comparable institution in thecountry.Present situation. When the Museum was set up, the Treasury stipulated thatit should not involve public funds in heavy building expenditure.The collection was therefore housed in the old riding school in thegrounds of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. For thisaccommodation it is now far too large; it has overflowed into the5454
corridors and cellars of the Academy itself. Even so, only considerably less than half of the collection can be put on show and it is stillgrowing rapidly. Moreover, its situation amidst the buildings of theRoyal Military Academy makes it difficult of access. It is not practicable to enlarge the present building and removal to anothersite is thus urgently necessary. The Commissioners of the RoyalHospital, Chelsea, have offered, on terms which are acceptable tothe Council of the Museum, the lease of a site in the Hospital grounds.The capital cost of the lease, and of the erection of a Museum, areexDected to be about  1 million, which the Council intend to raiseby public Appeal. Field-Marshal Sir Gerald Templer, who is amember of the Council, has campaigned tirelessly to this end, andhas already secured promises of over  300,000. For this purpose andto secure planning permission architectural drawings (and a model)of a building have been prepared. In order to secure an option on theChelsea site the sum of  500 a month has been paid since June 1964with the consent of Ministers from private funds offered for thispurpose.The ease for removal5. The removal of the Museum to London raises two questionsof policy. First there is the cost. The Museum in its present homehas incurred no significant capital expenditure, and its running costs(including a small annual grant for the purchase and maintenanceof exhibits) are about  40,000 a year. The capital cost of the move to London the purchase of the lease and the erection of thebuilding is to be met from private sources; the running costshowever will also rise. There will be the maintenance of the new building, and a larger staff to deal with the increased size of theMuseum. The amount might be another  100,000 a year. The chief secretary has agreed that this is not an overriding factor, nor is theexpenditure in immediate prospect; but before any public Appealcan be launched the Council of the Museum must be assured that public funds will meet the running costs of the new Museum.6. The second question concerns the policy for the dispersal ofcultural activities from London. This consideration was in the minds of the previous Administration; but that they did not regard it asoverriding is shown by the fact that they allowed Sir Gerald Templerto make preparations for the Appeal which have involvedapproaching (admittedly without commitment) a number of outside interests and to pay for an option on the site. It would create an unfortunate impression if at this late stage the project were disallowedbecause of policy objections which should have prevailed at the startif they were to be urged at all.7. I do not however consider that the argument here shouldturn merely on the interpretation of general policy. The case for moving the Museum to London depends on the availability now of auniquely appropriate site: it is Chelsea or nothing. Both the Museumand the Royal Hospital will benefit from the association, and withthe new Chelsea Barracks, will worthily display the history,
traditions and present life of the Army: it would be a matter foreverlasting regret if we were to let slip this opportunity to put the site to such an imaginative use.conclusion. June 18th is the 150th Anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo.The Army will be much in the public mind then, and it will be a most advantageous moment to launch a public Appeal for the Museum.But if this is to be done, a decision to proceed is urgently necessary.I therefore invite my colleagues to agree:(a) that there is no objection in principle to the move of theNational Army Museum to Chelsea;(b) that a public Appeal may now be launched to this end;(c) that the running costs of the new Museum should be met from public funds.D. W. H.Ministry of Defence, S.W.1,26th February, 1965.
