THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1965C. (65) 9 Copy No.    5 926th January, 1965CABINETCIGARETTE ADVERTISINGMemorandum by the Minister of HealthWith the agreement of Home Affairs Committee, I seek theapproval of my colleagues for the banning of cigarette advertising on television.2. Cigarette advertising was raised with the Prime Ministerduring a television interview last January, when he referred to itsvicious effect in causing young people to take up smoking. The PrimeMinister said he thought there were certain things a Governmentshould do right away: the advertisement of cigarettes should now be stopped, certainly on television; he did not see why all the newspaper proprietors should not be asked to cut out such advertisingin newspapers, and said he believed they would agree to this and no control or law would be needed.3. The health education campaign on the dangers to health ofcigarette smoking is being intensified. Among other measures, postersare on display in public transport and railway stations, and shorttelevision films have been prepared for early showing.4. The campaign would be immensely aided if anannouncement could now be made that the advertisement ofcigarettes on television is being brought to an end. The Postmaster-General has the power to do this by issuing a direction to theIndependent Television Authority.5. Consideration must also be given to other aspects such asadvertising of other tobacco goods and advertising in other media,and I am arranging for further discussions with the appropriateMinisters with a view to making further recommendations. But itis the general view of the Home Affairs Committee that anannouncement about television advertising of cigarettes should bemade as soon as possible. This would greatly increase the impact ofthe intensified health education campaign, even though there wouldbe a period of grace before the decision could become fully effective.5316
6. If this action is agreed by the Cabinet, the decision wouldbe conveyed to the Independent Television Authority by thePostmaster-General before it is announced. But he would be contentfor me to make the main statement in the House announcing theGovernments decision, and on the same day he would announce that he would be discussing with the Authority the operative dateof the ban. Notice of the decision would be given to the TobaccoAdvisory Board in confidence 24 hours before the announcement.7. I propose that my statement should be made orally inthe House, perhaps in reply to an arranged Question, for which1st February would be a convenient day. A draft statement to bemade by me and a draft Question and Answer by the Postmaster-General are attached for consideration.K. R.Ministry of Health, S.E.J,25th January, 1965.
