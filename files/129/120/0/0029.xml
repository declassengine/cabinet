THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1965C. (65) 29 Copy No.      522nd February, 1965CABINETCONTROL OF PRIVATE building memorandum by the Minister of Public building and works the Cabinet, at their meeting on 11th February (C.C. (65)9th Conclusions, Minute 3), asked for information about steps which might be taken to limit private house building and how faradditional resources might be freed by this means and perhaps byan intensification of the ban on the building of new offices, withlimitation on other non-essential building.2. This memorandum deals with the question of restrictinghouse building, office building and miscellaneous non-essentialbuilding by means of physical controls.Restriction on house building3. It would be necessary to define the category of houses to be restricted. This could be done either in terms of size of floor area or of money. The simplest method would be by floor area. It wouldtake considerable time before physical controls began to operate,since they would require legislation and the creation of machinery to deal with applications to build. An Interdepartmental working party of officials is making a technical study of possible systems ofcontrol.4. Although precise figures are not available for the private housing sector, in 1964 about 15,000-20,000 houses cost over  5,000per house to build (excluding the cost of land). This is by no means a high figure these days for a sizeable family house. The total ofsuch housing represents something over  100 million. If controlswere imposed so as to stop the more expensive houses being built,some purchasers would probably build cheaper houses and thenumber of houses below the cost limit would be increased. In orderto have an appreciable effect it would probably be necessary to forbid the construction of all houses costing more than about 5,500 to  6,000, excluding land. The approximate area of a houseof this value is between 1,200 and 1,500 square feet.5411
5. If control were confined to larger dwelling units it wouldbe relatively simple to impose. Units with a floor area below a givenfigure, say 1,500 square feet, would not be affected and permits wouldV\f  npertprl  for  anvtViina pyppfHino thic   Tf  wrmlH  hp  necfiSKnrv to prohibit additions to newly-built houses for a period aftercompletion in order to prevent evasion of the control. Moreover,whatever the technical problems there is the fundamental difficulty that physical controls would be seen by the building industry as a return to the &quot; stop-go &quot; policy of the past and would completelydestroy its confidence in the future, which I have been at pains tobuild up and which so largely determines its output and productivity.Office building6. Private sector offices account for nearly  150 million ofwork a year, or about 5 per cent of the total new construction work.The scope for increasing the degree of control on offices usingexisting powers is, however, limited. Well over half of all office building takes place in London, and a complete ban on office building in London is provided by the Control of Office andIndustrial Development Bill; under the terms of the Bill the bancannot be applied to the large volume of work for which contractswere let before the 5th November, 1964.7. The Board of Trade will have power to extend the ban toother areas of the country, though not in respect of buildings forwhich planning permission has already been granted. Outside london the two cities where congestion might justify restrictions on office building are Birmingham and Manchester. These account at present for about  7 million of such work annually, which is only a fraction of 1 per cent of the total demand for new construction work.Moreover, I have consistently told the building industry that theBill is a planning measure and not designed to restrict the total demand on the industry so as to reassure the industry that we arenot going back to &quot; stop-go &quot;.Other private building8. About  270 million a year is spent on work on garages,shops, entertainment buildings, private school and college buildings,etc., some of which might be regarded as non-essential. Here againlegislation would be needed and in this case, the administrative problems would be particularly complex.Manpower position9. The additional programme of 12,000 houses proposed by theMinister of Housing and Local Government would require about12,000 men if built by traditional methods but there would be aconsiderable saving if all the houses were built by industrialisedmethods. This saving cannot be quantified because of the wide rangein savings yielded by different systems. The massive switch toindustrialised house building referred to by the Minister of housing and Local Government in his memorandum C. (65) 17 could bringconsiderable savings in manpower.
Summary10. (1) Physical controls on private house building wouldrequire legislation and administrative machinery, take a long timeto become effective, and would cause great difficulty in our relationship with the building industry.(2) Under the Control of Office Bill the scope for furtherrestricting office building is limited.(3) Legislation v/ould be needed for restricting other private building.(4) A massive switch to industrialised methods in the public housing programme could bring considerable savings in manpower.C. P.Ministry of Public Building and Works, S.E.1,19th February, 1965.
