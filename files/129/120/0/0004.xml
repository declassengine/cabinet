THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1965C. (65) 4 Copy No.14th January, 1965CABINETCOMPREHENSIVE SECONDARY education memorandum by the Secretary of State for education and ScienceGeneral policy the Governments Election Manifesto stated &quot; Labour will get rid of the segregation of children caused by 11-plus selection;secondary education will be reorganised on comprehensive lines &quot;.The reasons for this policy, and for beginning to carry it out withoutdelay, can be summarised as follows:(i) The fallibility of all the methods used in the attempt to assess the potential capacities of children when they are \0\ years old.(ii) The wide local variations in the standard of attainmentrequired of children of this age as a condition of entry to a grammar school.(iii) Though some secondary modern schools have developedwell, others cannot offer the longer and more academiccourses of study for which many of their pupils are suited.(iv) The present separatist system tends to divide society bypreventing mutual understanding between those with greater and less academic attainment.(v) Primary schools in many areas are tempted to concentrate on getting pupils through the 11-plus tests where thesestill exist.(vi) In the last two or three years many local education authorities 68 out of 148 is the most recent figure have beenintroducing or devising schemes of reorganisation whichaim at getting rid of the 11-plus. Most of these schemesrelate to part only of an area and/or only to county (as opposed to voluntary Church) schools. Some of these schemes are admirable, some ill-advised. It is now timeto give a national lead, indicating the principles to be observed and the kind of problems likely to arise indifferent areas when reorganisation is planned.5288A
2. Possible methodsComprehensive education may be achieved by a variety of methods. Some of these have been tried, others are yet to beintroduced. To some extent different methods reflect genuinedifferences in objectives, but in the main they reflect the inescapablefact that any new organisation has got to fit into the existing stock of school buildings. This has been designed very largely for theseparatist system. The total number of secondary schools is 5,891.Since the war 3,383 new schools have been built or are in announcedprogrammes for two-thirds of the secondary population new placeshave been or are in process of being provided. The rate at which thestock of schools can be replaced is very slow and there is no prospectfor many years to come of establishing large numbers of comprehensive schools in purpose designed buildings.The main possible patterns of comprehensive organisation are:(i) Comprehensive schools which children enter at the age of 11,and in which they stay throughout their school life. Itwas previously argued that if such a school were to produce a Sixth Form of adequate size, its total size must be excessive. This argument has been weakened because ofthe growing proportion of children in all schools whostay on into the Sixth Form. In many areas a good school of this type need not contain more than about 1,000 pupils.Some comprehensive schools contain 1,500 or 2,000pupils, and there are some who take the view that thereare positive advantages in such a size. But, however this may be, there is no need to make the school as large as this in order to enable it to be a good comprehensiveschool..  (ii) The division of a school, such as that described in (i), intojunior and senior departments, in different buildings.- (iii) An arrangement whereby children, on leaving primaryschool, enter a &quot;junior high school&quot; which iscomprehensive in its range of studies. At the age of 13 or14 they either continue in that school or, if their parentswish, and are prepared to keep them at school till theyare at least 16, they go on to a &quot; grammar school &quot; for therest of their school life. This &quot; grammar school&quot; willprovide a wider range of studies than that name usuallyimplies, since it must meet the needs of all pupils whoseparents wish them to go. If, in time, a very largeproportion of parents do so wish, this system will become very like that described in (ii). This pattern and (iv) belowmust be regarded as temporary second best arrangementssince they involve some measure of segregation. while they exist it is essential that transfer to the &quot; grammar &quot;school should be on parents&apos; choice alone.(iv) Other two-tier systems. In these all the pupils, on leavingprimary school, transfer to a junior comprehensiveschool. At the age of 13 or 14 all the pupils have a choice
of senior school: one catering for those who expect to stay at school substantially beyond the compulsory age and the other catering for those who do not.(y) Comprehensive schools for the age-range 11-16, followed by&quot; junior colleges &quot; for pupils over 16.The common feature of all these methods is that they make it unnecessary to separate children into different schools on the basisof an &quot; 11 plus &quot; judgment. The main difference is that (i) can usuallyonly be adopted where new schools, planned as comprehensives fromthe start, are to be built; (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) make reorganisationpossible in existing buildings. To rely on (i) alone would be to postpone reorganisation for a very long time.3.   Objections of principleFour major objections will be raised by opponents of our policy:(i) That it means &quot; destroying the grammar schools &quot;. In my view, the essence of a grammar school is that it providesthat kind of academic education which we now call&quot; grammar &quot; education. It does not cease to do this whenit widens its range of studies to meet the needs of pupilsnow excluded by the &quot; 11 plus &quot;: indeed, since many ofthose pupils will in fact prove capable of following&quot; grammar &quot; courses of study, it will do its present jobfor a larger number of pupils. Our opponents appear totake the view that a grammar school cannot be a grammarschool unless it provides grammar education only, and provides it only for pupils selected by the 11 plus: theyare, in fact, defining a school, not by virtue of what it doesdo, but by virtue of what it does not do.(ii) That, whatever the merits of comprehensive secondary education, each local authority should be left to choosefor itself between comprehensive and separatist systems.The 1944 Education Act does not prescribe either system.Most of the country, after the war, developed on separatistlines without much consideration of merits, partly because it was administratively easiest, partly because it involved the least change from the past and partly because mucheducational opinion at the time favoured separatism.In theory, local authorities were legally free to &quot; gocomprehensive &quot;; in practice, this often involved steps(closure or enlargement of particular schools) which required Ministerial consent. There were also variousadministrative obstacles which the Ministry could erectin the path of a local authority which desired a comprehensive system. The Labour Government of1945-51 was not friendly to comprehensive reorganisation.Since then, the hostility of Conservative Governments,at first emphatic, has later been mitigated but notremoved: the Conservative Party cannot claim, on itsrecord, to have been champions of local autonomy in this field.   Nevertheless,   a  positive   decision   that   local5288
authorities ought to &quot; go comprehensive&quot; is a new departure. I believe it to be justified by the generalarguments in the first section of this paper. Further, peopletend to move from one part of the country to anothermore than they did in the past, and this tendency will increase: it is a duty of the central Government, in theinterests of the children, to see that local divergences in education are not too great. It would be neither possiblenor desirable to impose one method or one time-table onall authorities; but I believe it to be right to require themto commence the reorganisation, giving as much localflexibility as is consistent with carrying out the policyin our Manifesto. While many authorities will gocomprehensive willingly, others will not, and there willbe controversy about the principle of imposition of a central Government policy on local authorities. This maybe a contentious issue.(iii) The establishment of comprehensive schools can mean theestablishment of neighbourhood schools. It is inevitable that schools serving different kinds of areas will vary in quality and public esteem. Those in neighbourhoods wherea higher proportion of homes give children encouragement and a cultural background will normally be better schoolsthan those in neighbourhoods where social conditions arepoor. In theory it would be possible to compel parentsliving in Hampstead to send their children to school in,say, Hackney and vice versa. In practice this would involveso drastic an attack on the rights of parents to choose thebest and most accessible school which has room for their children that it is not practical politics. The best answersthat we can give to the neighbourhood school argumentare that the present system enables only the grammarschool child to escape from a poor background and thatthe fundamental job is to eliminate the poor social conditions altogether.(iv) Some educational  opinion  and some local educationauthorities continue to believe that separate grammar andmodern schools give a better education to all children.The academic child benefits by being in a school whichconcentrates on intellectual achievement, which sets high standards of work and attainment and in which the efforts of highly specialist academic teachers are devoted entirely to the kind of pupils they are best suited to deal with. Inthe modern schools the children of middling ability arenot discouraged by the presence of those of first classability. They have a chance to gain a sense of achievementand often blossom into success in various directions whichthey might never do in a school which included the mostable. Similarly in modern schools which Can be much smaller than comprehensive schools the least able and themost difficult children-those with very poor homebackgrounds can have the benefit of direct personalsupervision by teachers &quot;in a community which does not-    overwhelm them by its size. These are genuinely held
confh)entjalbeliefs, but they cannot be proved right. Our answer mustbe that the advantages of separate schools need not be lost in comprehensive schools provided these are properlystaffed and organised.There is a point about going comprehensive which is likely to beraised by some teachers rather than our opponents. The elimination of separate schools must mean a loss of headships and may seem to affect adversely the career prospects of non-graduate teachers whowill have to compete with graduates for posts of special responsibility.We shall have to watch this point in the context of the system of teachers&apos; pay.4.  Particular difficulties to judge from the tenor of the debate on 27th November andfrom Questions subsequently placed on the Order Paper, oppositionis now shifting from general principle to the particular difficulties and problems that will beset reorganisation, e.g. :(i) Consultation with teachers and explanation to parents areare essential to the preparation of any sound scheme of reorganisation.(ii) A comprehensive school can sometimes be located in a group of buildings which were previously separate schools: butthe soundness of this must depend on local geography,transport, mobility of staff, etc.(iii) Local authority building programmes up to the middle of1967-68 have already been authorised. Local authorities could not be required to go back on commitments theyhave already entered into for the building of particularschools in these programmes. This limits the extent towhich these programmes could be altered to make them more suitable to a policy of reorganisation.(iv) A number of local authorities provide for grammareducation, partly by paying for places in the 179 DirectGrant Schools. Some 100,000 pupils (forming 3 per cent of the total secondary school population) attend these schools, of whom 60 per cent have their fees paid by localeducation authorities. Some of these schools might be willing to broaden their basis of entry and no longerrestrict themselves to pupils competitively selected at theage of 10^-; others, perhaps notably the Roman Catholics,might be willing to give up Direct Grant status and enter the local authority system. The majority, however, wouldnot pursue either of these courses. In so far, therefore,as local authorities continued to take up Direct Grantplaces, some element of 11-plus selection would remain,, at any rate for some time to come. In so far as they cease to do so, many schools would need to seek my approval to an increase in fees, and this would be a question Iwould then need to consider, For the present, I should pursue a policy of not permitting any increase in thenumber of Direct Grant Schools: in longer term I believethese schools should either come within the local

In so far, therefore,as local authorities continued to take up Direct Grantplaces, some element of 11-plus selection would remain,. at any rate for some time to come.

For the present, I should pursue a policy of not permitting any. increase in thenumber of Direct Grant Schools: in longer term I believethese schools should either come within the local
authority system or be included in the proposals whichI shall later be making for dealing with independentschools.(v) Voluntary schools denominational. Some 245,000 pupils,representing about 9 per cent of the secondary school population in maintained schools, attend Church ofEngland and Roman Catholic schools: the numbers arenot evenly distributed over the country and in some areas the proportion of children in denominational schools isvery high. When a local authority, in addition to theother problems of reorganisation, has to ensure that theexisting rights of the Churches, and of parents, are notdisregarded, the problem is correspondingly more-complicated. From recent- conversation with leadingfigures in the Anglican, Non-conformist and roman catholic Churches, I learn that they have certainly nohostility to comprehensive reorganisation as such, butthat they would expect their claims to be given at least as much consideration as any of the other problemsbesetting reorganisation.(vi) Voluntary schools non-denominational. There are about250 voluntary secondary schools which are not of religiousfoundation. This category includes many of the best known and most highly esteemed grammar schools for example,in London there are among others:Camden  School for  Girls Frances  Mary BussFoundationColfes Grammar School for Boys-LeathersellersCompanyMary Datchelor Girls Clothworkers CompanyDame  Alice  Owen&apos;s  Girls  and Boys BrewersCompanyCentral   Foundation   Girls   and   Boys CentralFoundationWilliam Ellis BoysIt may prove impossible to persuade the Governors of schools of this kind to agree to absorption in a comprehensive system and there will be public protestswhenever we attempt to force the issue.These difficulties are considerable and it will be thetactic of the Opposition to magnify them in the hope ofpermanently obstructing comprehensive reorganisationwithout committing themselves to an out-and-out defenceof separatism and the 11 plus an attitude which is becoming increasingly unpopular. I cannot accept theview that these difficulties are insuperable: to do so would be to say that we are saddled for ever with the. 11 plus, whatever its demerits.It is of the nature of these difficulties that there is no one generalanswer to them. They have to be dealt with by scrutiny of each localauthority&apos;s plan for reorganisation. In some areas these difficulties are absent, or slight; in others we must accept that reorganisationconfidential^
can only proceed slowly. The complete establishment of comprehensive secondary organisation will take a considerable time.I believe, however, that in five years such progress could be made that the comprehensive system would be accepted as the normalpattern, towards which all local authorities were working, thoughnecessarily at different speeds. To take an analogy from the past: ithas been the law for 20 years past to conduct primary and secondary education in different schools, but the last of the &quot; all-age &quot; schoolshave not yet quite disappeared.5.  How to proceed in the light of all these considerations I believe that my nextstep should be to issue as soon as possible a circular to local educationauthorities; and that this should be followed by legislation in thenext Session. The circular would call on local authorities to submitplans for the reorganisation of their secondary schools oncomprehensive lines. It would draw their attention to the mattersmentioned in Sections 2 and 4 of this paper. It would lay equalemphasis on the Governments desire for genuine reorganisation andon the Governments recognition of the need for considerablevariation both in method and timing, and it would include guidance on general principles. Later on it may be possible to say that financial help will be given to help authorities surmount some of the particular difficulties: but I recognise that this cannot be said at present.I expect that the replies of local authorities would vary: there willbe enthusiasm; moderate enthusiasm; cautious acceptance; reluctantacceptance; delaying tactics; and, perhaps, in a few cases, outrightrefusal.In my view, legislation is needed both to prevent absoluterefusal by some local authorities and to satisfy all authorities thatthis is firmly and permanently national policy. I think that absoluterefusal would be rare; but if there were no mention of legislationmany authorities would delay action in the hope of a change ofpolicy and a few awkward authorities might be encouraged not onlyto refuse themselves, but to try to recruit supporters amongauthorities who would otherwise be willing to co-operate.The legislation should (1) make clear that the &quot; national policy &quot;referred to in the 1944 Act includes (as far as the secondary stage isconcerned) the comprehensive principle, (2) make such detailedalterations in that Act e.g., Section 13 as follow from (1). It wouldnot need to be a long Bill but it would unavoidably be controversial.Meanwhile, the Opposition have selected this subject for a Supplydebate on 21st January. I ask my colleagues to agree:(i) That, when speaking in this debate, I should present the argument set out in this paper.(ii) That I should issue a circular as described in paragraph 5.; M.  S.Department of Education and Science,14th January, 1965.
