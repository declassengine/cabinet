THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1965C.(65) 1129th January, 1965Copy No.   dCABINETTHE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGHER education memorandum by the Secretary of State for Education andScienceAt their meetings on 7th December and 14th January my predecessor put before the Ministerial Committee on Social Servicesproposals that he should be authorised to announce:(i) that, bearing in mind that the 10 colleges of advanced technology are on the threshold of university status, itwould not be necessary, with one possible exception, tocreate additional universities or to promote any furtherinstitutions to university status in the next 10 years;(ii) that the expansion and development of technological education at a high level will best be furthered by continuing the build-up of the three* specialisedinstitutions named by the Robbins Committee by giving them priority in the provision of finance, both capital and current, and by encouraging the many promisingdevelopments in the technological departments of otheruniversities;(iii) that we should therefore not follow the recommendation ofthe Robbins Committee that one of the colleges of advanced technology should be selected for designationas a special institution but that we would consider further the question of creating one completely new technologicalinstitution;(iv) that we should confirm that, like the previous Government,we accepted the objective of providing 390,000 places in higher education by 1973-74, of which 218,000 should bein universities;(v) that we now proposed to adopt the Robbins Committee&apos;sobjective of making up the total of 390,000 places inEngland, Wales and Scotland by providing 122,000 incolleges of education and 50,000 in technical colleges.* Imperial College, the Manchester College of Science and Technology,Strathclyde University.5343a
2. He said &quot; with one possible exception &quot; at (i) above because,while there does not appear to be a case purely on grounds of educational need for the creation of a new university institution,there may well be strong arguments for it in the interests of regional development. I should like to come back with further proposals onthis after I have had time to study it further and discuss it with theFirst Secretary. My colleagues will of course recognise that if we wereto decide to provide a major technological institution, say, onTees-side, it would involve substantial investment over and above ourpresent programme.3. My predecessor emphasised the importance of a statement on the lines of (i), (ii) and (iii) as a means of putting to an end thegreat state of uncertainty in the higher education world, and theCommittee approved these three proposals. He also urged that weshould make an announcement on the lines of (iv) and (v), partlywith the object of offsetting what might otherwise be regarded as a negative statement, and partly to allay the fears that (despite ourannouncement in The Queen&apos;s Speech that we were determined to giveparticular priority to increasing the supply of teachers) we have infact no intention of increasing the target for the number of teachers in training. This was set, for England and Wales, at 80,000 by 1970by the previous Government as long ago as January 1963, nearly ayear before the Robbins Committee reported.4. While my colleagues accepted that our statement mustcontain something positive, some of them demurred over ourcommitting ourselves to anything beyond the general objective of390,000 higher education places by 1973-74 accepted by the previous government, and proposed that we should defer any statement onthe expansion of the colleges of education until we had completedour study of public expenditure over the next five years.5. It is known that we have long had the advice of theUniversity Grants Committee and the Advisory Council on scientific policy on the points covered at (i), (ii) and (iii) above. Greatuncertainty prevails about the Governmenfs intentions. I do not feelthat I can wait three or four months before making a statement onthese points. But to make one in isolation would be undulynegative.6. 1 do not see how we can avoid confirming the previousGovernmenfs undertaking to provide by 1973-74 390,000 higher education places, with 218,000 in universities, in Great Britain as awhole. Once we have done this we have committed ourselves to additional investment and the only question is how it should be distributed between teacher training and further education.University places cost most, training college places rather less, andtechnical college places less still. I am not asking to put up theuniversity figure, but to allocate the 172,000 non-university places as Robbins proposed, with 122,000 to teacher training and 50,000to further education. This will involve comparatively little fresh
investment before 1970 on the expansion of the training colleges interms of work done, viz., at most:  million1967-68    ...............       2-01968-69    ...............       7-01969-70    ...............      10-5Additional recurrent expenditure is estimated at  2-6 million in1969-70.7. We shall be challenged to say what we are doing to reducethe size of classes and the Opposition know well that even the increaseI am proposing will not enable us to get classes down to a reasonablesize by 1970 let alone eliminate primary classes over 30. Moreover,the National Advisory Council for the Training and Supply of teachers are about to advise me publicly that the Robbins target of111,000 training college places in England and Wales by 1973-74 isquite inadequate, that it should be reached much earlier, and replaced by a new target of 120,000 in England and Wales alone by that date.I can hold the position only if I can show that we are not going to doworse than our predecessors and I repeat that I am suggesting wedo no more than fill out the outlines of the policy to which, togetherwith the investment involved, they had committed themselves.T therefore ask for authority to make a Statement after Questions interms of the draft annexed.8. There are problems also in Scotland, but I understand fromthe Secretary of State for Scotland that he would be content to seematters rest for the time being on the basis indicated in the Statement.A.

DRAFT STATEMENT ON HIGHER EDUCATIONQ. To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Sciencewhether he has any statement to make about the developmentof higher education.A.   Yes, Sir.The Government have now considered the recommendations ofthe Robbins Committee for the expansion of teacher training places,the creation of additional universities, and the designation of SpecialInstitutions for Scientific and Technological Education and Research.The Robbins Committee recommended a 10-year programmedesigned to provide by 1973-74 390,000 full-time higher educationplaces in universities, colleges of education and technical collegesin Great Britain.The last Government accepted this objective and promised toprovide the necessary resources.The Government confirm that they accept the objective of390,000 places in higher education by 1973-74, and that of this total218,000 places should be in universities.The Government now propose to adopt the RobbinsCommittee&apos;s further objective that 122,000 of the remaining placesshould be in colleges of education.This will double the number of students now in the colleges. Itwill also leave room for a large increase in the number of students in further education institutions.These measures will not only contribute significantly to the widening of educational opportunity which was promised in theGracious Speech; they will also secure a further large increase inthe output of teachers for our schools.I shall keep the whole subject of teacher-supply under closereview and I look forward to receiving shortly the next report ofmy National Advisory Council on the Training and Supply of teachers.On the question of new universities, the Government have considered the advice given by the University Grants Committee,and it is now clear that the target of 218,000 university places in1973-74 is well within the capacity of existing universities and other institutions of university status.As the House knows, the Colleges of Advanced Technology andthe Central Institutions in Scotland are all being given universitystatus and will be brought fully within the ambit of the university grants Committee on 1st April next.The Government have, therefore, decided that no additionaluniversities or accessions to university status will be needed for about10 years, with one exception. They are actively considering thepossibility of creating within that period a completely newtechnological university institution in the North-East.
The Government will of course examine well before the 10 years are up the possibility that more universities may be. neededthereafter.The Government have also considered, with the advice of theUniversity Grants Committee and the Advisory Council on scientific Policy, the important recommendation of the RobbinsCommittee that five institutions should be developed and designated as a category of superior institutions to be known as SpecialInstitutions for Scientific and Technological Education and Research.They wholly accept the principle of selective development and expansion of technological education at a high level. They consider,however, that this will be best achieved not by creating a separatecategory within institutions of university status, but by continuing the build-up of the three specialised institutions named by theRobbins Committee (Imperial College, London, the ManchesterCollege of Science and Technology, and Strathclyde University).These will be given priority in the provision of finance, both capital and current; and, as I have said, the creation of a new technologicaluniversity in the North-East is being urgently examined.But the Government do not accept the recommendation to selectone out of the 10 Colleges of Advanced Technology for special treatment; and they have decided, on balance, against giving anyinstitutions a special designation as &quot; S.I.S.T.E.Rs.&quot;The House will see that the Government accept the substance of the Robbins Committee&apos;s proposals on this matter. But, as tomethod, they prefer to encourage and expand the many promisingdevelopments in the technological departments of Other universities,including colleges of advanced technology and they wish to preventthe false impression arising that a first-class technological education is only available in a small handful of institutions.The Government will keep the whole development of higher education under review.
