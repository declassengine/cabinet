THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1965C. (65) 17 Copy No. 5 38th February, 1965CABINETHOUSING PROGRAMME-ENGLAND AND wales memorandum by the Minister of Housing andLocal government an increased public programme the purpose of this Paper is to ask for agreement to an increasein the public housing programme (local authorities and new towns)in England and Wales during the current year. The Secretary of Statefor Wales supports this.2. In the Cabinefs discussion on 28th January of long-termprogrammes of public expenditure (C.C. (64) 5th Meeting, Item 3) itwas accepted that a separate submission should be made to theCabinet on the size of the housing programme.3. The housing programme is worked on approvals given during the calendar year. During 1964, 144,000 approvals were given.The Secretary of State for Wales and I want to increase this for 1965to 156,000. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has so far felt unableto agree to more than 135,000, with the possibility of some additionwhen decisions are taken about long-term programmes of public expenditure in July. But that would mean that, at any rate during thefirst six months of the year, we should have to cut public authoritiesback, below last year&apos;s rate. In our opinion we must, on the contrary,do better than was done last year.The case for increase4. Need. Our pledge was to increase the building of new houses, both for rent and for sale. Under the previous Governmenthouses for rent lagged well behind houses for sale; and rented houses are now the great need. It is only the public authorities who can andwill build rented houses on any scale; in addition to which most ofthe many hundreds of thousands of families at present in wretchedhousing conditions can only afford a subsidised rent.5. Local authorities have been held down from building all thatthey wanted and knew that they needed to build. Last year&apos;programme was their biggest for some years, but given encouragementthey will do more; and I propose now to settle a four-year forwardprogramme with them. For years they have been concentrated onslum clearance, old people, overspill and relieving the worst squalorand over-crowding. Though households have been increasing fast,they have been allowed to build very little to meet general needs.They must now be allowed to do more.5368
6. Use of industrialised building systems. A rising publicprogramme is moreover necessary in order to promote greater use ofindustrialised building; we can only do this by organising big,forward orders. At the same time proper use of industrialised systemsmakes a rising public programme feasible.7. I am advised by the National Building Agency that there isnow productive capacity in certain well established systems of theorder of 50,000 dwellings a year four times the number built lastyear. Nothing could more effectively show our determination topromote efficiency in all sectors of the economy than a dramaticincrease in the use of labour-saving methods in house-building. Wecannot achieve this unless we can authorise bigger programmes wherethe authorities will use these methods.capacity of the industry8. The Minister of Public Building and Works agrees that whatthe Secretary of State and I are proposing should be well within the capacity of the building industry, provided that we make it acondition that at least all the additional dwellings approved are built by industrialised methods. Provided the public programme is increased as proposed I am confident we can secure that at least thewhole of the increase will be by way of industrialised systems. Ishall be disappointed if we do not do a good deal better than this.9. It is true that private builders were estimating earlier thisyear that they also would build more; but whether they will in factdo so we cannot yet tell. In any event we cannot accept that the people in the greatest need of houses are to be held down because people who can afford to buy are free to go ahead. If the private sector shows signs of getting out of hand we shall have to consider ways and meansof ensuring a properly balanced housing programme.Impact on the budget10. The impact on the budget of an increased programme ofthis kind will depend on the outcome of the review I amundertaking of housing subsidies, on which I hope to introduce legislation in the 1965-66 session. Payment of subsidy begins on average about two years after approval. On present subsidies the costof increasing the public housing programme by 12,000 a year wouldbe nothing for the first two years, and thereafter an addition of 400,000 each year.Conclusion11. I ask my colleagues to agree to a programme of156,000 approvals of local authority and new town housing in 1965,provided that the increase in industrialised house-building alreadyexpected for this year can be accelerated to cover at least theadditional 12,000 dwellings.as well.R.
