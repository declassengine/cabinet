THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1965C. (65) 49 Copy No.    5 924th March, 1965CABINETTHE MIDDLE east memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs am concerned in this paper with the area bounded by Libyain the west and Iran in the east, and Syria in the north and Sudanin the south.2. United Kingdom interests can be stated under the following headings:(a) The pursuit of peace and stability in the areaThis must be our overriding objective since it is the basic Condition for protecting our other interests. In theeastern part of the peninsula, our positions enable us tomake a direct contribution to stability, and our treaty obligations towards our CENTO partners and towardsthe Libyan Government are directed to the same end.Elsewhere in the Middle East our action must be mainlydiplomatic and economic and to be effective requiresclose co-operation with the United States Governmentand, where appropriate, with the United Nations. Thepossibility of an eruption of the Arab-Israel conflict is always the most serious danger in the situation.(b) The countering of Soviet penetration and the preservation of an East I West balanceSince the first Soviet bloc arms deal with Egypt in1955 we have had to reckon with the Soviet presence inthe area. From about 1958 onwards the chinese communists also began to show an interest and there arealready some indications of rivalry between the twoCommunist Powers, although the USSR is now and islikely to remain the dominant one. Although the U.A.R.and Syria, and at times Iraq, have been prepared to enterinto fairly close relations with Moscow and have equippedtheir forces for the most part with Soviet arms, there isconsiderable resistance to Communist penetration in the
Arab countries where Islam and Arab nationalism tendto be anti-Communist and where the Governments wishto remain non-aligned. By establishing a northern shieldin CENTO and by maintaining good relations with mostof the countries of the area, we and the other western powers have so far been able to hold the balance, withthe result that Soviet penetration, though a present andfuture danger, has not yet been able to make a reallysubstantial advance. Adverse factors in the situation forus are the whipping up of anti-Western emotions bypropaganda from Cairo and elsewhere, and the strainsproduced by the Arab-Israel situation.(c) The protection of United Kingdom material interests the Middle East has three-fifths of the proved oilreserves of the free world and produces nearly half thefree world output. Of the international oil companies which have developed these resources, those of the UnitedKingdom have roughly a 40 per cent interest and areconcerned in all the main Middle East oil-producingareas except Saudi Arabia. The United Kingdom also has a great interest in these resources as a consumer, sincetwo-thirds of total Middle East production comes to western Europe including the United Kingdom, and wedraw 60 per cent of our oil needs from the area. It is tobe hoped that the growth of other fields will graduallyreduce the relative importance of this source of fuel, butthe absolute size of our requirements from it is likely to grow steadily. Our Middle East supplies are also ofconsiderable balance of payments importance since as aresult of the operations of British companies, of whicha predominant part occur in the Middle East, the balanceof payments cost to us of our oil imports is very much less than their absolute value. (In 1964, we obtainedsome  470 million worth of oil for a foreign exchange cost of  200 million.) By our contribution to order andpolitical stability, particularly in the area around thePersian Gulf, and by maintaining so far as we can good relations with the producing and transit countries, weprovide the stable framework within which theinternational oil compaines are best able to secure intheir dealings with the host Governments the continuedflow of oil we need on favourable terms.The steadily increasing oil production in the middle east means that the countries in the area receive growingrevenues from the oil companies and in consequence theMiddle East is a rapidly increasing market for our exports.These are at present running at about  250 million a yearbut we have fallen back somewhat in recent years inrelation to our main competitors and there is plenty ofscope for an increase.
(d) Transit and overflyingThe U.A.R. Government has honoured its international obligations in regard to passage through the suez Canal (except towards Israel) and so long as this is so, no serious problems are likely to arise over our sea communications. The overflying and staging of military aircraft is of great importance, particularly at a time of active operations in Malaysia, and this is inevitablysubject to changing political conditions in the countriesthrough which our aircraft have to fly. The recent changeof regime in the Sudan has largely denied us the southernroute to the East through Libya and the Sudan andcorrespondingly increased the value of the route from cyprus over Turkey and Iran. But our use of thesouthern route may well be restored to a substantialdegree and it must be our aim to keep the maximumoptions open.3. It will be apparent from this brief rehearsal of our interests that, although from the material point of view they mostly reside in the eastern part of the area, and although it is there that any direct Soviet pressure, if it were exerted, would first be felt, their protection requires us to think about our relations with all thecountries of the area. This would in any case be forced upon us bythe fact that developments in one part of the Arab world invariablyand increasingly have repercussions in all the other Arab countries,a circumstance which we have to take particularly into account whenhandling the complexities of the Arab-Israel situation. The politicalinterdependence of the area is reinforced by the activities of president Nasser whose influence is at work not only in the affairs of the Levant but also, thanks at least in part to his involvement in.the Yemen, in increasing our difficulties in the South ArabianFederation; in the eastern part of the Arab world through hisapproach to a form of union between Iraq and the U.A.R.;potentially in the Gulf States; and throughout Arabia and north africa, if not further afield, through his propaganda and subversive activities. Inevitably President Nasser&apos;s name comes up in consideringmost of the problems facing us in the Middle East, of which the mainones are dealt with in the subsequent sections of this paper.United Kingdom relations with the U.A.R.4. These have recently been the subject of a paper which I circulated to the Defence and Overseas Policy Committee. I therebrought out that Nasser had as an objective to eliminate the Westerninfluence in the Middle East based on positions in the area, with ourown as the first target, and that as an immediate aim he wished to expel us from Southern Arabia and thus render untenable our positions in the Persian Gulf. His aim in South Arabia is made very clear by the campaign of intimidation and subversion which is being directed against the South Arabian Federation and against theColonial Secretary&apos;s programme for bringing a new South ArabianState to independence by 1968.1 pointed out however that the U.A.R.
had proved unable to achieve a success in the Yemen despite thepresence there of nearly 50,000 troops, and that it was passing through an acute balance of payments crisis. I concluded that althoughNasser&apos;s difficulties would not be likely to endanger his own positionnor cause him to give up his longer term aims, which are clearlyincompatible with our own positions, his policies were normallyheavily laced with pragmatism; I therefore thought it important tokeep our lines out to him, in order to see whether we could not atleast take some of the tension out of our relationship and if possiblepersuade him to give the South Arabian politicians a chance to bring their State to independence without the more direct kinds ofsubversion and intimidation to which they are at present subjected.I therefore proposed that we should continue the dialogue with theU.A.R. Government inaugurated by my predecessor, and that in due course we should arrange a Ministerial visit to Cairo. However, therecent increase in Egyptian-inspired terrorism in Aden, and theincrease in tension between the U.A.R. and the West resulting fromthe quarrel picked by Nasser with the German Federal Republic,mean that a visit during the Easter recess, which I had originallyhad in mind, would not be timely and we must await a morepropitious moment. I have so informed the U.A.R. Government.CENTO5. CENTO, despite the success of its economic programme, hasbeen a disappointment to the regional members (Iran, Turkey and pakistan) on the military side. Their complaints have been that theUnited States Government (who participate in all the organisation^activities but have always refused to become a full member) andwe ourselves are not prepared either to build up an effective militarystructure, with Supreme Commander, force commitments and otherfeatures of NATO, or to allow CENTO to become involved in thequarrels of the regional countries with their neighbours (Pakistanwith India, Iran with Nasser and Iraq, Turkey with Greece). Therehave recently been indications that Iran and Pakistan might wish tobring this matter to a head and I was therefore interested to havethe opportunity, during his recent visit to London, to learn at firsthand the views of the Shah of Iran. He voiced to me the abovereasons for his dissatisfaction with CENTO but I was able to put to him the arguments for not disturbing CENTO on its present basis.I said to him that, in the absence of a dangerous military threat fromthe north, it was not necessary to build up the kind of militarystructure which would be needed in order to deal with one, yet itsabsence did not signify that CENTO had failed in its purpose. Thiswas to make it clear to the Russians that they must leave the member countries alone or they would find themselves coming up against theWestern Powers, with all that that might imply. If CENTO were tobe liquidated, it would be seen as a political reverse for the west and would be so exploited in Soviet and Arab propaganda. Iranwould be exposed to increased Soviet pressure and neutralistpressures inside the region would be stimulated which might carry the different Governments all too far from their present pro-Western
alignment. I thought therefore that the regional members would be best advised to leave well alone, and to make the best of CENTOwithin its current limitations. The Shah disclaimed any desire tobring matters to a head and may well be content to let CENTOcontinue as at present, which is I think the best course. I shall beattending the forthcoming meeting of the CENTO Council in Tehranon 7th April and if I there hear an expression of the same kind ofdissatisfaction, I propose to speak on the same lines.Arab-Israel dispute6. There is regrettably no sign that any progress is possibletowards a settlement of this most serious of all problems in theMiddle East. The Arab countries remain unreconciled to Israel&apos;s veryexistence. No Arab leader however realistic would dare to advocateacceptance of Israel as a State and any advocacy of a settlement by outside Powers is invariably interpreted by the Arabs as a pro-Israelmove. Meanwhile the United Nations Truce SupervisoryOrganisation, with its headquarters in Jerusalem, continues to watch the armistice demarcation lines with Jordan, Syria and Lebanonand to try to prevent incidents escalating, and the United NationsEmergency Force is still deployed in the Gaza Strip and along theU.A.R. border. Although some small progress has been made in settling the Palestinian refugees, the United Nations Rehabilitationand Works Administration continues to be necessary to providerelief and an educational programme. President Kennedy triedthrough quiet contacts with both sides to see whether it was possibleto organise some solution of the refugee problem but this provedunsuccessful.7. The last year has seen certain developments which threaten to make the situation more acute, since under the leadership of president Nasser, the Arab Governments have agreed on a programme which in time may produce a more direct confrontationwith Israel. The occasion for this was the completion of the Israelipipeline to draw water from Lake Tiberias. The Arabs counteredwith proposals for diverting the northern headwaters of the Jordanbefore their entry into Lake Tiberias (two of the three main northerntributaries rise in Arab territory). Both Israeli and Arab works are capable of compatibility with the plan for the use of the Jordanwater system proposed by Dr. Eric Johnston of the United states in 1955, and the Israel Government maintains that it will draw fromLake Tiberias only the volume of water provided for in the JohnstonPlan. They fear however that the Arab diversions, on which work isonly in its initial stages and will take a long time to complete, will exceed the Johnston Plan allocations and cause a serious increase inthe level of salinity in Lake Tiberias with consequent harm to Israel.There is still ground for technical argument as to whether the amountof harm which the Arab action could do to Israel would be serious,but the Israelis are preoccupied also with the effects of an Arabpolitical success if the; Arab countries show themselves capable ofconcerted action. In addition the Arab countries have agreed that,since they saw a danger of Israel striking at them in order to
prevent their diverting the Jordan headwaters, they would form a unified military command to make defensive plans and dispositions.This command, under Egyptian leadership and financed by arab league (mainly Kuwaiti) funds, is making slow but steady progressin improving the defensive capabilities of the Arab countries..8. Our present assessment is that Israel would be the victor inany trial of military strength with the Arabs and that the U.A.R. and israel Governments are both well aware of this. The IsraelGovernment do not, therefore, feel immediately threatened by these developments but see them as evidence of a long-term Arab plan to weaken their position and improve the chances of Arab victory overthem. They were consequently particularly shocked by the decisionof the German Federal Government, following news of Nasser&apos;invitation of Ulbricht, to stop sending military supplies to her. Thisshock increased the Israeli feeling of isolation and gave some impetusto the activist school in the Israel Government who can be relied upon, in times of stress, to press for Israeli pre-emptive aggressive action against the Arabs, arguing on this occasion that U.A.R.involvement in the Yemen provided a favourable opportunity.9. Israeli anxiety will no doubt also encourage them to press on with putting themselves in the position to manufacture nuclear weapons (they have the technical means to do this within two orthree years, whereas there seems to be no comparable capacity onthe Arab side). If the Israelis did acquire a nuclear capability theArabs might well feel justified in aggressive pre-emptive action, andin any case would press the Soviet Union to ensure them a positionof parity. We believe that the Russians would give a guarantee against an Israel nuclear attack rather than weapons. This would at onceneutralise the deterrent force of the Israel bomb, and increase therisk of an East-West confrontation in the Middle East.10. The situation therefore contains dangerous elements andwill need to be handled by the Western Powers with great care. TheUnited States Government were sufficiently alarmed by the possibilityof Israeli aggressive action to send Mr. Harriman to Jerusalemrecently in an endeavour to secure an undertaking that such action would not be taken, in return for a promise of United States military supplies, The problem for us also is an acute one. Mr. Macmillan&apos;sstatement of May 1963 (which in effect superseded the tripartite declaration of 1950 and expressed our continuing opposition to theuse of force by either side) committed Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentto &quot; consult immediately with the United Nations and take whatever action we felt to be required &quot; in case of a threat to the peace. Wehave no formal commitment to Israel, but we have a clear moral obligation to support the United States in ensuring if necessary thatIsrael is not overwhelmed. It is moreover an obvious Westerninterest that the situation should not erupt into serious fighting, since this above all would be liable to produce a polarisation betweenIsrael and the Western countries on the one hand and the arab countries and the Soviet bloc on the other, a situation which couldonly work to harm Western interests in the Arab countries. We must,
therefore, in co-operation with the United States Government do all we can to prevent the situation becoming really acute. The support from the two Governments which enables Jordan to maintain herpolitical independence is one vital part of this policy, and recognised as such by Israel. They must also continue to play their part in seeing that Israel is able to secure the defensive arms she needs to preservean adequate balance with the Arab armies, notably that of the U.A.R.,while avoiding the encouragement of the arms race (we believe thereis no prospect of any kind of understanding on this point with theSoviet Government).11. However, because of our interests in the Arab world andthe need to preserve peace in the area which may be threatened byIsraeli pre-emptive action as well as by the Arabs, we must maintain our position of balance and non-partisanship in the dispute. TheUnited Nations is already heavily engaged in this problem and our best course is to encourage Israel to work through the United nations at every stage and not to take unilateral action. Above all we mustkeep in the closest contact with the United States Government whowould have to play the primary military role if it were necessary forthe West to come, in the last resort, to israels rescue. On accountof their wider Middle East interests, they too have avoided any formalcommitment to Israel but they have repeatedly assured the Israelisthat, if they were attacked, the United States 6th Fleet would be withthem. This is known to the Arab Governments and public and is a vital piece on the board.The Persian Gulf12. Our historical connection with the Persian Gulf enables usdirectly to maintain peace and stability in this otherwise potentiallyvery unstable area, the location of so much wealth and the scene of so many rivalries. In our absence there would be a security vacuumwhich would be likely to do grave harm to political stabilitythroughout the area and to the production and transportation of oil,as well as encourage a renewal of Soviet southward pressure. Wealone can play this stabilising role because of the positions we holdalong the eastern and southern shore of Arabia; it would not bepossible for the United States or any other Western Power to take these over from us. The support of our military effort in the Gulf isone of the main reasons why we need the base at Aden and why the continuing involvement of Nasser in the Yemen, with its consequentstepping up of subversion in the South Arabian Federation, has causedus so much concern. Our presence in the Gulf is something whichNasser, and the Iraqis with an eye on Kuwait, would like to remove,but it remains fully acceptable to the Governments of the Gulf Statesand is supported by Iran and Saudi Arabia, both of whom would be greatly disturbed by a further advance of Nasser&apos;s influence whichwould be one likely result of our withdrawal. With the object ofmaking our positions in the Gulf more secure and of anticipatingpressure from local nationalist movements, we are actively engagedin modernising our relationship with the Sheikdoms, and this
involves keeping up pressure on the Rulers to modernise their ownAdministrations. Progress.is steady and reasonably satisfactory inBahrain and Qatar; it is inevitably slower in the Trucial States withtheir small populations and rudimentary Administrations, anddepends on building up joint institutions, though this is difficultbecause of the local rivalries. We cannot however afford to standstill since Arab nationalist pressures from outside are already makingthemselves felt, using the channel of the Arab League. Our interestdictates that we should co-operate closely with Saudi Arabia, kuwait and, so far as possible, Iran in trying to keep these pressures under control; it is unfortunate that no solution has yet been found to thelong-standing dispute with Saudi Arabia over Buraimi since, althoughthe Saudis are not actively pressing it at present, it remains a bone ofcontention.13. I should add that the contribution which our forces makedirectly or indirectly to physical security along the southern shore of the Gulf (Trucial Oman Scouts and help to the Sultan of MuscafsArmed Forces), is of particular importance in the new oil-fields whichare now, or will shortly be, coming into production. Abu Dhabi, bothonshore and offshore, shows every sign of becoming a major producer,and the production of oil in Oman from 1967 is now being preparedfor.Overflying14. The need to maintain good political relations with thecountries along both the southern and northern routes is my primaryconcern. I would hope that as the new Government in the Sudansettles down, it may gradually be possible to resume flights through and over the Sudan to Aden and further east. Relations with KingIdris and the Government of Libya remain good and, provided thereis no radical upheaval, for instance on the King&apos;s death, we can look forward to a further period of using El Adem under our DefenceTreaty with Libya; our military arrangements are being adapted, inagreement with the King, to reduce the size of our military presence in the country and to concentrate it in the eastern part of his Kingdom.Meanwhile the northern route has increased in importance and givenhew emphasis to the need for watching our relations with turkey and Iran with especial care. One consequence of this re-orientationhas been to bring into greater prominence the staging post at MasirahIsland which we maintain by agreement with the Sultan of Muscatand Oman.United States policy15. In all important respects, United States interests in theMiddle East are similar to our own. In terms of defence installationsthey are less directly involved, for only in Libya do they still havean air base and this is required mainly for training and stagingpurposes. Although, in absolute size, their oil interests are larger than ours, they are not so significant for the United States economy
either in terms of supplies or the balance of payments, in view of thelarge domestic United States oil production. For these reasons theUnited States position in the Middle East is somewhat less vulnerablethan ours. On the other hand, they have been more directly involvedin the Arab-Israel problem and for broad political reasons are just as concerned as we are with promoting stability in the area. Forthis reason we find it easy to co-operate with them on most problems,and it is particularly necessary for us to do so in view of the considerable influence they can exert in the area, because of their military and economic strength (they have been meeting 30 per cent of the U.A.R.&apos;s grain requirements through their aid programme, andafter 1957 they took over from us responsibility for the larger partof the assistance which our two Governments provide for Jordan).We have the opportunity to make a special contribution to the jointeffort through our influence in South Arabia, the Persian Gulf andLibya, but in dealing with the Arab-Israel situation it is their military capability which in the last analysis provides israels ultimate security.Experience has shown that when the policies of the two countries inthe Middle East diverge radically, our interests are liable to suffer.In recent years this has happened rarely, and only over the Yemenand our respective attitudes towards President Nasser has it broughtus some embarrassment. Even here we have each been able to handleour separate policies in full understanding of the other. There is nolonger the degree of Anglo-American rivalry in the oil business which caused some friction in the 1950s.Conclusions16. I consider we should pursue the following policies in handling the complex Middle East problems that confront us:(a) Our aim should be to build up the best possible relationship with each of the countries of the area. We must make special efforts with those countries whose interests are particularly closely bound up with our own, but we shouldnot neglect the others though we clearly cannot set oursights very high in the case of the U.A.R. The broadspread of work performed by the Ministry of overseas development with its out station in Beirut, and by theBritish Council, are valuable in showing our disinterestedconcern for the area as a whole, irrespective of politicalups and downs.(b) We should avoid getting involved in the internal disputes and conflicts in the area, to the extent that this is possible.It is clear that where we have commitments, e.g., to Iran,Libya or the States of the Gulf and South Arabia, wemust fulfil them and this may on occasion, as happenedwhen Iraq threatened Kuwait, or when as now the U.A.R.is stirring up trouble in the South Arabian Federation,draw us into taking sides. We should, however, keep such occasions to the minimum in order to avoid creating theenmities which increase our difficulty in defending our interests.

(c) In the particular case of the Arab-Israel situation, we shouldcontinue in the handling of current questions to preserve the position of non-partisan balance between the two parties and should encourage the maximum reliance byIsrael on the United Nations as the channel through which she seeks outside help where necessary. We should at the same time, in conjunction with the United StatesGovernment, continue to help Israel obtain the defensivearms she needs; and should as necessary reaffirm to herour opposition to the use of force or threat of force inthe Middle East and our intention to take whatever action we feel may be required should the peace be broken by the Arabs, as also our acceptance of a moral obligation, together with the Americans, to ensure hersurvival; but make it clear that the corollary is that Israelmust not take any military initiatives either by openlypre-emptive attack or excessive retaliation to minorincidents for deterrent purposes.(d) We should continue to support CENTO broadly along itspresent lines, going as far as we can to satisfy Iran and pakistan without getting involved in an unnecessary and unacceptable development of its military organisation orthe diversion of its activities to meet the localpreoccupations of its regional members.(e) We should maintain our presence in the Gulf as a peace-keeping and stabilising force in an area where avacuum would create conflict and instability. We shouldcontinue the process of modernising our relationship withthe protected States in Arabia with the aim of meetinglegitimate nationalist aspirations and giving ourselves abetter chance to maintain our positions in the area on adurable basis. We must of course, here as elsewhere, be constantly on the watch for any means of lightening our defence burden without weakening unacceptably our capacity to carry out our commitments.(/) We should work in the closest possible co-operation with theUnited States Government, and should maintain close touch with other Western Governments with an interestin the Middle East, just as we do with friendlyGovernments in the region.M.
