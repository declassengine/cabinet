THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1965C. (65) 15 Copy No.     593rd February, 1965CABINETFARM PRICE review memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of LancasterAt their meeting on 28th January, 1965, the Cabinet invited meto arrange for the Farm Price Review Committee to consider the issues involved in this year&apos;s Farm Price Review and circulate a papermaking recommendations to the Cabinet on what total offer shouldinitially be made in the Review and what was the maximumdetermination that would be acceptable (C.C. (65) 5th Conclusions,Minute 4, Conclusion (1)).2. The Committee have been unable to reach agreement uponrecommendations to the Cabinet and my paper has therefore tooutline the main issues for decision and the differing points of view.The area of dispute3. The Cabinet know from the Agricultural Ministers&apos; earlier memorandum (C. (65) 8) that the maximum reduction in the valueof price guarantees which the Government can propose this year is 10 million. This is where the Treasury and Economic Ministerscontend that the negotiations should begin. The Treasury ministers are firmly of the opinion that the maximum reduction of  10 million should be insisted upon. The Department of Economic Affairs doesnot so firmly insist on the maximum reduction but is &quot; adamant&quot;that there should be no increase in the price of milk to consumers.4. The Agricultural Ministers will have none of this. they believe that such a proposal would be politically indefensible: they believe that, if the Government opened negotiations with such aproposal, the negotiations would break down forthwith and the farmers&apos; Unions would walk out and start a rumpus. They fear notonly the immediate political consequences but also the longer termeffect upon the willingness of the Farmers&apos; Unions to co-operate inthe long-term planning of Government agricultural support.The Agricultural Ministers&apos; main case5. The Agricultural Ministers consider that the Governmenfsopening proposal should be for an increase of  3 million in the value5351
of the guarantees. This would be regarded by the farmers as a&quot; break even &quot; offer, since an increase of  3 million in the value of guarantees plus the estimated value of increased efficiency ( 25million) would just cover the increases in costs. This would requirethe farmers to absorb virtually the whole of cost increases in greater efficiency and would provide no improvement in farmers&apos; incomes.The industry were assured by our predecessors that, taking one year with another, they would normally be left with a share of the gain from increasing efficiency. Nevertheless the Government reserved theright, in exceptional circumstances, to make the maximum cut of24- per cent, less net increase in costs (this year the maximum cutwould be  10 million). The Agricultural Ministers think that the farmers would quote our predecessors&apos; assurances against us, andreject an increase of  3 million out of hand, since it would mean thatthey would make no progress at all this year toward their aim ofincreasing their income by 25 per cent in the three years beginning1964-65. The Agricultural Ministers would therefore wish to be ableto offer increases totalling up to about  10 million in the value of guarantees. They doubt if even this would achieve an agreed Review,but they think that they could defend and justify imposing it.Milk a question of price increase6. The Agricultural Ministers would wish, either at the openingor during the course of negotiations, to be able to offer an increaseof Id. a gallon in the guaranteed price of milk. The value of thiswould be  8-8 million. It would mean increasing the price of milk to the consumer by a pint for four months during the next financial year. Since milk prices may in any case have to rise by %d.sl pint for four months next year to cover increases in distributioncosts, this would be likely to mean that the price of milk would go up by -\d. a pint for eight months next year. An increase of 4jd. a pintin the retail price of milk would mean an increase of 0-13 in theindex of retail prices (all items) and 0-43 in the index of food prices.It would also mean additional Exchequer expenditure of  11- million on welfare milk.7. The Agricultural Ministers fear that without such anincrease in the guaranteed price milk production may decline to apoint where seasonal local shortages develop. They point out that,though the size of the average herd has been increasing as smallproducers go out of business, the total number of dairy cows is nowlower than it was.in 1963-64 and the number of heifers in calf hasrecently been declining. The high price and the world shortage of beef increases the temptation to kill dairy cows for beef and to moveout of milk production into beef production. The agricultural ministers expect the Farmers&apos; Unions to seek an increase of 6d. a gallon in the guaranteed price; they fear that without an increaseof Id. a gallon there is a danger of an irreversible decline in production. If the choice is between an increase in price and ashortage of supplies of milk for liquid consumption, they think anincrease in price the smaller of two evils.
The rejoinder of the Treasury and Economic Ministers8. Economic Ministers Ministers from the Department ofEconomic Affairs, the Treasury and the Board of Trade considerthat the Government should start by proposing the maximum permissible reduction in the value of guarantees  10 million. this cannot be achieved unless there is no increase in the guaranteed priceof milk. These Ministers (especially the Treasury) also consider thata reduction of  10 million should be the ultimate determination(though the Department of Economic Affairs might be prepared to contemplate going up to an increase of  3 million (the &quot; break even &quot;point), provided that there was no increase in the consumer priceof milk).9. The Treasury and Economic Ministers point out that lastyear&apos;s determination was exceptionally generous: it increasedfarming incomes by 15 per cent and the average farmer&apos;s incomeby a little more, since the population of farmers has been falling atthe rate of two-thirds of 1 per cent a year. They consider that anincrease in farmers&apos; incomes of this order, even taken over two years,is inconsistent with Government policies. If it were permissible to propose a reduction of more than  10 million in the total value ofthe guarantees, they would wish to do so; since it is not permissible,they consider that the Government should propose the maximum permissible reduction and not budge from it.Milk from the economic point of view10. The Treasury and Economic Ministers accept that whatthey propose in total would mean no increase in the guaranteed priceof milk; but they believe such an increase to be unnecessary. they point out that the guaranteed price of milk was increased by 4-d.the year before last and 24-d. last year, and they consider that theeffect of these increases on production has not yet been by any meansfully felt. They therefore consider the risk of a fall in output to be small. They also point out that liquid consumption accounts for about70 per cent of farm sales of milk, the rest going into manufacture of milk products, including butter. Some margin between liquidconsumption and farm sales is necessary to ensure adequate suppliesof liquid milk all the year round in all parts of the country; but thepresent margin is historically fairly high, and the Economic Ministerssuggest that the risk of some erosion (which they believe would atworst be very slight) of the present margin can be accepted. Theywould be prepared to agree that negotiations should open on thebasis of no increase in the guaranteed price of milk, on theunderstanding that if it became clear beyond peradventure that tomake no increase would imperil supplies of liquid milk, thepossibility of increasing the guaranteed price by Id. per gallon couldbe reconsidered. The Agricultural Ministers think that it would be&quot; ridiculous &quot; even to start on this basis.A minor disagreement on beef11. Of the other unresolved disagreements the main is the guaranteed price of fat cattle. Agricultural Ministers wish to increase
the guaranteed price so as to stimulate production in view of theworld beef shortage. Their best assessment of future prospects is a continuing strong demand on the world market, with no sign of anyunexpected increase in supplies, and they see this state of affairscontinuing for up to five years. The Economic Ministers are scepticalof these forecasts: they point out that experience shows that whensupply and demand in this field get out of line they tend to comeback into line again, usually in ways which cannot be foreseen and often much more quickly than had originally been thought possible.They see no need to stimulate beef production this year, and therefore no need to increase the guaranteed price. An increase in the guaranteed price of fat cattle without an increase in the guaranteed price of milk would accentuate the risk of switches from milk tobeef production.Conclusion12. These and other less important issues can be pursuedfurther by the Farm Price Review Committee. But the main issues,upon which the Committee have been unable to reach agreement,remain those of the overall figures at which the Government should begin and end in negotiations, and the price of milk, which is the biggest single factor in deciding what the overall figures shall beand is really the clue to the major dispute between Ministers. these issues are closely inter-connected and there is a large political element in whatever decisions the Cabinet may make.13. To sum up, the issues which need to be settled before anyfurther progress can be made are:(1) Should the Governments opening proposal be for:(a) the maximum permissible reduction of  10 million inthe value of the guarantees;(b) a smaller reduction than this; or(c) an increase of  3 million (&quot; break even &quot;)?(2) Should the Governments sticking point be:(a) the maximum reduction of  10 million in the valueof the guarantees;(b) an increase of  3 million (&quot; break even &quot;); or(c) an increase of about  10 million?(3) Should the guaranteed price of milk be raised by Id. a gallon, bearing in mind that it would be virtually impossible to achieve a reduction in the total value of guarantees if the guaranteed price of milk were to beraised?D.
