THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1965C. (65)25 Copy No.    5318th February, 1965CABINETROYAL COMMISSION ON MEDICAL education memorandum by the Secretary of State for Education andScience1. Medical education is a matter requiring urgent, high-levelenquiry. Among problems requiring attention are the exceptionally high cost of producing doctors; the organisation of new medical schools; the future of the London medical schools; the relationship of medical education to the development of the National health service; and the whole field of post-graduate and post-experiencemedical training. A proposal for a high-level enquiry has been madeby the University Grants Committee. Soundings of the professionshow that the reaction will be favourable. The Social services committee considered, on 9th December, a memorandum which my predecessor submitted to them about this enquiry. They agreed with my proposals and considered that the subject warranted a RoyalCommission.2. The question has been raised whether the status of a RoyalCommission is needed for this enquiry. The Minister of Health andI have considered this carefully, and believe that the enquiry should carry the maximum weight with the medical profession and in the universities; any substantial recommendations are likely to be controversial and must command the fullest authority if they are tobe accepted by a profession very resistant to change. This is whywhen in Opposition we ourselves urged the appointment of a RoyalCommission. Moreover, the General Medical Council has announced the formation of its own Committee to undertake a detailed andtechnical review of the undergraduate medical curriculum (this isthe &quot; current review by the [General Medical] Council&quot; mentionedin the draft terms of reference in paragraph 3 below); and it isessential that the two enquiries should not be confused and that theGovernment enquiry should be seen to be indisputably the morewide-ranging and definitive. This again in our view points to RoyalCommission status.5399
3. The terms of reference of the enquiry might be on thefollowing lines:&quot; To review medical education, undergraduate andpostgraduate, in Great Britain, and in the light of national needs and resources to advise Her Majesty&apos;s Government on whatprinciples future development (including its planning andco-ordination) should be based. In particular, in the, light ofthose principles and having regard to the statutory functions ofthe General Medical Council and the current review by that council of recent changes in the undergraduate curriculum, toconsider what changes may be needed in the pattern, number,nature, or location of the institutions providing medical education or in its general content; and to report.&quot;These should be cleared formally with the General Medical Council,who have statutory responsibilities in this field; but contact withthem suggests this will present no difficulty. ,4. I seek the agreement of the Cabinet to the setting up of a royal Commission on medical education with terms of reference: onthe lines of those set out in paragraph 3 above.A. C.Department of Education and Science, W.1,17th February, 1965.
