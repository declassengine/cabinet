THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1965C. (65) 16 Copy No.     5 93rd February, 1965CABINETPRICES AND INCOMESMemorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretaryof State for Economic AffairsMachinery of Prices and Incomes policy the Cabinet will wish to review the progress that has been made towards establishing an effective policy for prices and incomes sincethe Joint Statement of Intent on Productivity, Prices and Incomeswas signed on 16th December. That statement recorded the agreementof the Government, trade unions and management on the need toset up machinery:(i) to keep under review the general movement of prices and of money incomes of all kinds;(ii) to examine particular cases in order to advise whether ornot the behaviour of prices or of wages, salaries or othermoney incomes is in the national interest as defined bythe Government after consultation with management and unions.2. Subsequent discussions have resulted in agreement that the review of general movements in prices and incomes (i.e., (i) above)could best be undertaken by the National Economic development council (N.E.D.C.) with the assistance of the N.E.D. Office. the examination of particular cases (i.e., (ii) above) v/ill require the setting up of new machinery and it is agreed that this could besttake the form of a Prices and Incomes Board, sub-divided for mostpurposes into separate Panels dealing with price and income casesrespectively. The proposed arrangements are set out in the documentannexed which I have been discussing with the Trade UnionCongress (T.U.C.) and the four employers&apos; organisations and whichI shall be reporting to the N.E.D.C. on 3rd February.3. The principal points to which I should draw attention inthese proposals are:(i) Subject to Her Majesty&apos;s approval, the Board will beappointed by Royal Warrant as a Royal Commission.It will thus depend for its effectiveness on voluntaryCONFIDENTIAL5352 A
co-operation rather than on statutory sanctions. Butparagraphs 6 and 18 record that the Government wouldhave to reconsider this if voluntary co-operation proveineffective.(ii) The Board will be primarily independent in its composition.But its membership will include representatives of management and unions.(hi) All  references  to  the  Board  will  be  made  by  theGovernment.(iv) The Prices Review panel will be capable of reviewing notonly cases in which prices have risen but also those inwhich there is no reason to suppose that prices oughtto have fallen but have not in fact done so.(v) The Incomes Review panel will be able to review claimsas well as settlements. In practice it will probably bedesirable as a rule to consult both sides at least informallybefore a current claim is referred for review.4. The General Council of the T.U.C. have already expressed their readiness to agree to the proposals in the annex, provided thatthe employers&apos; organisations do likewise. There is, I think, little doubt that the employers&apos; organisations will agree, but a formaldecision to this effect cannot be taken before the meetings of thegoverning bodies of the Federation of British Industries (F.B.I.),British Employers Confederation (B.E.C.) and National Associationof British Manufacturers (N.A.B.M.) on the morning of 10thFebruary. Barring only some unforeseen hitch, we should thereforebe in a position to announce on the afternoon of 10th February thesuccessful completion of the second stage of our discussions. I would propose, if the Cabinet agree, to make a brief oral statement after questions and to arrange for the annexed document to be publishedlater in the day as a White Paper. Thereafter we would proceed withthe necessary steps to set up the Prices and Incomes Board and arrange simultaneously to wind up the National IncomesCommission.Criteria of prices and incomes policy5. While the Prices and Incomes Board is being constitutedand the necessary staff brought together we shall be discussing first with trade union and employer representatives and later in N.E.D.C.the setting of a &quot; norm &quot; for incomes and the criteria according towhich individual movements in prices and incomes can most appropriately be assessed. This is a potentially difficult stage. It isa field in which views differ. We could easily get bogged down in long and unprofitable arguments. My aim will be to concentrate on securing agreement fairly rapidly on at least the main principlesby which the Prices and Incomes Board should be guided, so thatit can start its work without delay. These principles can be elaboratedlater on, if necessary, either by further discussion in N.E.D.C. orin the light of the experience gained by the Board itself.
Organisations not represented by the T.U.C. or employer bodies6. The application of policy and of the proposed machinery to the varying circumstances of individual sectors, industries or services will need a great deal of thought and will doubtless call for more detailed consultation with particular interests than wouldhave been appropriate in the main negotiations with which we havebeen concerned hitherto. We have in particular to remember thatthere are some very important employers (e.g., the local authoritiesand nationalised industries) which are not represented on theemployers&apos; organisations and large groups of workers (e.g., in theCivil Service and National Health Service, teachers, policy, etc.) whoare not members of bodies affiliated to the T.U.C. I have discussed with the Ministers most concerned how we can best ensure thatwe do not forfeit the co-operation of these groups by appearing tobe unmindful of their interests. Their existence makes it all the moreimportant that our policy for prices and incomes should be seen tobe a policy which is being fairly applied, in whatever manner maybe most appropriate, in all sectors and which has the full supportof the Government as a whole.The outlook for 1965Wages and salaries7. I must stress that we can only expect limited results fromthe new policy in the short term. The Minister of Labour has told us that over half of all manual workers are due under agreements which had already been negotiated before the end of 1964 to receiveimprovements representing an average increase in hourly rates of pay of over 5 per cent per annum in 1965. Over one-third of these workers are due to get both straight increases in pay and reductions in hours, and it is possible that at least some of the other two-thirdswill have secured both increases in pay and reductions in hoursbefore the end of the year. Bearing in mind existing commitments and expected new claims, and the rapid rise in the retail price indexover the past year, it is likely that the average rate of increase inhourly rates in 1965 as a whole will be well over 5 per cent perannum. This compares with an average rate of A\ per cent per annum in both 1963 and 1964. The rise in average hourly earnings, as opposed to negotiated wage rates, can be expected to be even greater.In 1963 average hourly earnings rose by 4  per cent and in 1964 byjust over 8 per cent, compared with an average rise in negotiatedhourly rates of A\ per cent.8. We have had a preliminary discussion in the economic development Sub-Committee on Prices and Incomes of the attitude which the Government should take to wage and salary claims to be presented in 1965, and of the relationship of the proposed new machinery for reviewing prices and incomes with the existing machinery of negotiation, arbitration and conciliation. We are clearthat any changes in the existing machinery can only be introducedvery gradually and by consent, if confidence in the new policy andconsequently its ultimate chances of success are not to be undermined.CONFIDENTIAL5352 a 2
A great deal will be dependent on the influence which the T.U.C.and the employers&apos; organisations are able to exercise behind thescenes.9. I propose that in the first few months after the proposed new machinery for prices and incomes has been set up we should try to select for reference to the body those cases of price increases which appear to conflict most flagrantly with the national interestand, in the wages and salaries field, certain cases which are widelythought to merit exceptional treatment. This will help to build uptrust in the new body in its early stages. This in turn will help toget the body&apos;s findings accepted when later on we refer morecontroversial cases in the wage and salary field. If the new policyworks as I hope it will, the criteria of the national interest laiddown and the findings of the review body on individual cases shouldhave a substantial influence on arbitrators, Wages Councils, and review bodies in the public services as well as on negotiators in theprivate and public sectors. We may in due course consider referringan arbitration or Wages Council award to the new body for advice on the bearing of the national interest but such action would clearly be unwise in the earliest stages.Profits and dividends10. The trend in aggregate profits has been consistently upwardssince 1962 following two years of stagnant experience. Over the past five years (up to the third quarter 1959) aggregate profits in fact roseby 344; per cent and gross trading profits by 33 per cent comparedwith an increase in aggregate wages and salaries over the same periodof 384j per cent. It is desirable to consider the trend of profits over aperiod of at least five years in order to put fluctuations due to thetrade cycle in perspective. The Government have undertaken, in theJoint Statement of Intent on Productivity, Prices and Incomes, to use their fiscal powers or other appropriate means to correct anyexcessive growth in aggregate profits as compared with the growth oftotal wages and salaries, after allowing for short-term fluctuations.11. Over the same period aggregate dividends paid on ordinaryand preference shares rose by 77 per cent. Dividends as a percentageof gross trading profits of companies rose rapidly in 1959 and 1960following the replacement of the differential rate of tax on distributedprofits by a flat rate profits tax in April 1958. Some companies may also have seen a more generous distribution policy as a defence against take-over bids which have become more frequent in recentyears. However, since 1960 dividends have risen slightly less rapidly than company profits.12. According to the most recent forecasts, gross trading profits of companies are expected to maintain their share of total money incomes in 1965. This implies an increase of 7 per cent over 1964.Since the stock of capital will be greater than in 1964, income/assetratios (or the return on capital employed) are likely to be aboutthe same as in 1964, and rather higher than the low point reached in 1962. The prospect of a corporation tax may encourage a
somewhat more conservative dividend distribution policy than inrecent years, so that the rise in dividend payments may prove tobe less than the rise in profits.Prices13. The retail price index rose by just under 5 per cent in 1964,compared with a rise of just under 2 per cent in 1963. This is thehighest increase in a year since 1955. It can be accounted for partly by the increases in indirect taxation and in food prices during thecourse of the year and partly by earlier increases in import prices and in wage and salary costs feeding through to selling prices.14. The rise in prices is expected to continue in 1965. InDecember it was forecast that retail prices will rise at an annual rate of about 34 per cent in the coming year. A new forecast is nowbeing prepared which allows for a rather faster growth of earnings and this may raise the forecast increase in retail prices above thefigure of 34 per cent.15. It is a misfortune that our attempts to secure an effectiveincomes policy should have been preceded by one of the most rapidincreases in the cost of living that we have seen in recent years. Thefact that the recent rise in prices is expected to continue as a resultof further rises in import prices of raw materials and in wage and salary costs will put the prices and incomes policy under severe strainin its first year. However this is the more reason for striving toestablish an effective policy as soon as we can.16. The machinery and the criteria for observing a prices and incomes policy to which I have already referred should help toestablish a climate in v/hich firms examine contemplated price increases more critically and in which it is less easy to pass increases in cost automatically on to the consumer. Our action in asking anumber of firms and trade associations to justify recent price increases will also help to establish such a climate. We must continueto take every opportunity of stressing in public that we simply cannot afford price increases on the recent scale and that every effort mustbe made to absorb increased costs through increased efficiency.Conclusion17. We must press ahead with setting up the machinery ofprices and incomes policy and establishing the &quot; norm &quot; and the criteria of the national interest as quickly as possible. But changesin our traditional attitudes to questions of pay and prices can onlybe achieved gradually if they are to be lasting. We cannot hope to stop the wage-price spiral at a single attempt. But we can aimprogressively to slow it down, so that the outlook for 1966 shouldbe distinctly better than that for 1965.G. B.Department of Economic Affairs, S.W.1,3rd February, 1965.

CONFIDENTIALRey_i.sed._D   a   t.....25.63Maohinery^of Prices and Inoones ?o1icy1;   In the Joint Statement of Intent on Productivity;, prices and Incomes signed on 16th December. 1961+, the representativesof the employers&apos;  organisations and the Trades Union Congressundertook on behalf of their members to co-operate with theGovernment in endeavouring, in the face of practical problems,to give effective shape vo the machinery that the government intend to establish for the following purposes:-(i)    to keep under review the general movemement of prices and of money incomes of all kinds;( ii)    to examine particular cases in order to advise whetheror not the behaviour of prices or cf wages,  salariesiv other money incomes is in the national interest at defined by the Government after consultation withmanagement and unions.Machinery for review2.    The first function involves ascertainment,  interpretationand assessment of the relevant facts about general price and income behaviour.    An agreed policy for prices and incomesrequires that representatives of the Government, Management and unions should be closely associated with the general review.    i will be appropriate, therefore, to invite the National economic development Council to carry out the review.3.    The ascertainment and interpretation of the relevant factswill require considerable statistical and economic expertise aswell as complete impartiality.    This work will be done &quot;by theNational Economic Development Office and Government Departments(since most of the factual and statistical material will beprovided from Government sources) and the results embodied inreports submitted by the National Economic Development Officeto the National Economic Development council-k*    The National Economic Development Council will review thereports submitted to it and consider their implications for thenational interest.    In the light of this review, Government,Management and Unions will be expected to take any action thatmay be required in their respective spheres of responsibility.Machinery to examine particular cases5.    The Government have discussed with Management and Unions- 1 -

the practical problems involved in establishing machinery to investigate particular cases of price and income &quot;behaviour andwith their agreement now propose the setting up under royal warrant of a National Board for Prices and Incomes working intwo separate panels, to be known as The Prices Review Paneland The Incomes Review Panel respectively.6,    The Government have been encouraged by the Statement of intent and in subsequent discussions to believe that all theparties concerned will give the Board their voluntary-operation in its investigations of particular cases.    TheGovernment would have to consider giving the Board statutory authority, however,  if experience showed this was necessary.Cojnpc^si^ion7.    The Board will consist of an independent Chairman,, a numberof independent members, a businessman and a trade unionist.Some of the members may be part-time.    Collectively, theindependent members will need to have expertise in law,accountancy, economics,  industrial relations and other relevantfields.    In addition to these permanent appointments to theBoard, panels of businessmen and trade unionists will beappointed to assist the Prices Review Panel and the IncomesReview Panel with the investigation of particular cases.G.    Two of the full-time independent members will share withthe Chairman of the Board the chairmanship of the Prices ReviewPanel and the Incomes Review Panel.   Each Panel will be enabled to sit in two or more divisions under an independent chairman,The Chairman of the Board will be responsible for allocatingwork to the Panels and between divisions of each Panel, as wellas for co-ordinating the wark of the two Panels.Staff9.    The Board will have its own staff, which will includeaccountants, experts on industrial relations, economists andstatisticians.The:. Prices Review PanelCases to-^be^Jjry^stij^ted10. The success of the prices policy will depend on the extentto which individual firms apply it in practice.    There willalso have to be a willingness tc accept investigation of individual cases referred to the Prices Review Panel.    Thenational employers&apos;  organisations and the T.U.C. will have a vital part to play in securing the support of their members for- 2 -CONFIDENTIAL

the policy.   It will also be helpful if the national employers&apos;organisations can advise their members on the application of thepolicy.11.    In principle,  the Prices Review Panel will be able to investigate any price or group of prices (manufacturing,wholesale or retail) of goods and services in private industryand in nationalised industry.    Both particular cases of price changes and cases in which there has been no change, althoughprima facie some reduction appears to be warranted will be covered.procedure for making references12,    The Government will retain direct responsibility for allreferences to the Prices Review Panel.   Some of these may result from complaints made to the Government by individuals,interested parties or independent bodiesj others will be directly selected by the Government as meriting detailed investigation.Procedure and s/peed^of^ investigation13.    The Panel will decide its own procedure, and in particularhow far,  if at all,  it will sit in public.    The Panel will nodoubt take evidence from the industry or firms whose prices are under examination, and from any other interested party (e.g.representatives of purchasers or consumers).   Any evidence ofa confidential nature, the publication of which would damage the legitimate business interests of the firm concerned, will betaken in private and will not be published.    Two to three months should be the maximum for the length of an inquiry.Incomes Review PanelCases to be invg^tjigajted1h.   The success of the policy will depend on the extent tov/hich unions and employers and others concerned with fixingincomes apply it in practice.    There will also have to be a willingness on the part of those directly concerned to acceptinvestigation of claims, settlements and other questions relating to incomes referred to the Incomes Review Panel.    TheT.U.C. and B.2S.C. (or N.I.O.) will have a vital part .to play in securing the support of their members for the policy.   It willalso be helpful if they-can advise their members on theapplication of the policy,,15.    In principle it will be desirable  of- the Panel to be able-D-

the policy.    It will also be helpful if the national employers&apos;organisations can advise their members on the application of thepolicy.11.    In principle, the Prices Review Panel will be able to investigate any price or group of prices (manufacturing,wholesale or retail) of goods and services in private industryand in nationalised industry.   Both particular cases of price changes and cases in which there has been no change, althoughprima facie some reduction appears to be warranted will be covered.P^ocedure^ for making references12.   The Government will retain direct responsibility for allreferences to the Prices Review Panel.    Some of these may result from complaints made to the Government&apos;by individuals,interested parties or independent bodies; others will be directly selected by the Government as meriting detailed investigation.Procedure and speed pf..J-iiye-sjy.^aJ^ion13.   The Panel will decide its own procedure, and in particularhow far, if at all, it will sit in public.    The Panel will nodoubt take evidence from the industry or firms whose prices are under examination, said from any other interested party (e.g.representatives of purchasers or consumers).   Any evidence ofa confidential nature, the publication of which would damage the legitimate business interests of the firm concerned, will betaken in private and will not be published.   Two to three months should be the maximum for the length of an inquiry.Incomes Review PanelCases to be investigated14.   The success of the policy will depend on the extent towhich unions and employers and others concerned with fixinginco.mes apply it in practice.    There will also have to be a willingness on the part of those directly concerned to acceptinvestigation of claims, settlements and other questions relating to incomes referred to the Incomes Review Panel.    TheT.U.C. and. B.3.C.  (&apos;or N.I.O.) will have a vital part .to play in securing the support of their members for the policy.    It willalso bo helpful if they-can advise their members on theapplication of the policy,15.    In principle it will be desirable for the Panel to be able&quot;D-

to investigate claims and settlements relating to wage and salary increases, reductions in hours and other improvements in conditions of service, whether in the private sector, the nationalised industries or the public services; cases in whicha revaluation of pay levels or an overhaul of the pay structureseems to be indicated for economic or social reasons; the levelof earnings in an industry or sector; and. where appropriate,cases of increases in money incomes other than wages and salaries.16.   As in the case of prices, the Government will retain direct responsibility for all references of claims, settlements andother questions to the Incomes Review Panel.    Some of these maybe at the request of one or both parties,  others may be directlyselected by the Government as meriting investigation..    It ishoped that in all cases the parties directly concerned will be willing to have claims brought before the Panel where theGovernment consider this is desirable in the national interest.ElLQo^dm^e^and^sneed^ of inves ti gat i on17.    The Incomes Review Panel, like the Prices Review Panel,will decide its own procedure,  including the extent to which itwill sit in public.    It will no doubt take evidence from theparties immediately concerned and from other interested parties.Reports should be available within two or three months of references being made, and if possible even more quickly in thecase of claims.Acceptance^ of Board&apos;s f^djmj^s^nd reccmmendations18.    The Government intend to give the voluntary method everychance of proving that it can be made to work.   Accordingly, inthe case of both prices and incomes, persuasion and the pressure of public opinion will be relied upon to ensure that the findingsand recommendations of the Board are accepted by the parties concerned.    The Government would resort to other methods only if they were convinced that the voluntary method had failed.Il^QQ-gdure for making references- k -
