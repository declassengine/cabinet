S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENT)C. (65) 32 COPY NO.    gg23rd February, 1965CABINETHOUSING PROGRAMME 1965Memorandum by the Secretary of State for ScotlandThere are important differences between the housing situationand outlook in Scotland and that in England and YTales. Two of theseare relevant to the consideration of C. (65) 26, C. (65) 28 and C. (65) 29.Industrialised Building in scotland .       Although the pressure on building resources in Scotland has notbeen nearly as heavy as it has been in parts of England, I am glad tosay that public authorities are already making considerable use ofindustrialised methods.    I estimate that in 1964 40 per cent of multi-storey and 10 per cent of other public sector houses were built bythese methods, and that in 1965 these percentages should reach atleast 55 and 15.    This represents in 1964 one-sixth, and in 1965one-fifth of the entire public sector programme.3.       The National Building Agency have recently completed asearching review of the industrialised systems available or in proapectin Scotland, which shows that there is the productive capacity for afurther increase in system -built houses.    This review is about to beconsidered by the consortium of local authorities and other publichousebuilding agencies which accounts for some 70 per cent of all ourpublic sector housing output.    In it the Agency commend a limited number of systems   each of which gives a considerable saving of sitelabour.4.       In the light of the review there is a good prospect that thehousing authorities in the consortium will build one-third of all their houses over the next five years by industrialised methods and I amurging them to extend their joint programming.The Role of the Private Sector5.       During the past seven years the private sector in Scotland hasbuilt 47, 000 out of 240, 000 houses - only one-fifth of total outputcompared with the three-fifths built by the private sector in Englandand Wales.    There is no sign of the private sector rapidly increasingits share:  at the end of 1964, only 16 per cent of the houses under construction were for private owners.

6.       It is important for economic development in Scotland thatthere should be a better supply of houses to purchase, because firmsesta.establish.ing themselves, or expanding, often need to bring in keymembers of staff - managerial, scientific and technical - many ofwhom wish to buy houses.    A number of firms have complained thattheir employees have difficulty in finding suitable houses.    Ourattempts to expand Scottish industry ought not to be hampered in thisway.7.       Nevertheless I would not hesitate to restrict private investment in housing if it looked like diverting scarce resources from the expanding public sector programme which we need.    But the resourcesof the Scottish building industry were not fully taxed in 1964, whentotal housing output rose to 37,000 from some 28,000 in 1963; indeed the average period of completion of public sector houses fell duringthe year.    Accordingly I would not wish to apply in Scotland any of the controls canvassed in C. (65) 26, C. (65) 28 and C. (65) 29.    For thetime being I am confident that we can achieve a sizeable increase inthe public sector without cutting back private housing.    (There is little luxury housebuilding in Scotland; most of the private housessell for between  3,000 and  5,000.)8.       We should allow fully for regional economic needs in anycontrol of private housebuilding as in our control of office building,I consider that it would be damaging to our growth prospects tointroduce restrictions in Scotland now.W.
