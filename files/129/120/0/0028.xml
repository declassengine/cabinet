THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1965C. (65) 2822nd February, 1965CABINETHOUSING programme memorandum by the Minister of Housing andLocal government at the meeting on 11th February I was invited (i) to define theareas in which it was proposed that additions to existing public housing programmes should be permitted and (ii) to explore means for ensuring that the additional allocations would be implementedby industrialised building methods (C.C. (65) 9th Conclusions,Minute 3). I have consulted the Secretary of State for Wales and theMinister of Public Building and Works.Location of additional housing2. The parts of the country in which the need for more public sector housing is greatest are:The North-east the North-WestThe West Riding of YorkshireSouth wales in addition, London and Birmingham and the overspill townsdirectly associated with them present special problems.3. Fortunately in all these areas there exists a considerableunused industrialised building potential, a large part of which thelocal authorities are already in a position to take up. Preliminarysurveys by my Department and by the National Building Agencyshow that two-thirds of the additional 12,000 houses I have proposedcould be built by industrialised methods in the three northern areas and South Wales. The surveys confirm, too, that provided that thelabour can be made available there would be no difficulty in buildingthe remaining one-third by the same means for London and birmingham. I have, of course, no intention of increasing theprogramme in other parts of the South-East and the Midlands.4. The 1965 estimates made by firms which have industrialisedsystems to offer in these areas amount in aggregate to more than could be achieved this year, since the systems will be in competitionCopy No.   5 95410
with one another for manpower and materials in short supply(especially cement and plasterboard). But even if the firms&apos; estimates are halved and the surveys I have mentioned suggest that this is an over-cautious adjustment they show a productive capacity morethan sufficient to match the increased programmes in the areas of need.5. The potential increase in industrialised building this year&apos;s  indeed much greater than the additional programme for which Iam asking. This surplus capacity will enable me, after allocating mostof the 12,000 extra houses to the northern areas and South Wales, toencourage system-building in other parts of the country where skilledmanpower is in short supply. In London and in Birmingham, forexample, and in the towns providing for their overspill, it v/ill bepossible to build by industrialised methods a sizeable number ofhouses which in the ordinary course of events would be built byconventional means. The Minister of Public Building and Works andI consider that, provided we make this systematic switch toindustrialised methods on a sufficiently ambitious scale, the additionalload on the construction industry can be borne.6. The concentration of the increased programme in these areas means that I must try to hold local authorities in the restof the country to the 1964 level. This restraint will not be easy, formany of the authorities (in the Midlands, for example) have severehousing problems; some have substantial slum clearance needs.Manpower implications of industrialised building7. It is impossible to generalise about the savings in manpoweron site from the use of industrialised methods. Systems vary greatly in their use of site labour and the savings in manpower comparedwith traditional building methods range from 50 per cent to10 per cent. In selecting the systems to be recommended for use,the National Building Agency and my Department will givepreference to those which effect the greatest savings in manpower.Means of promoting use of systems8. I have shown that the capacity for increased use ofindustrialised methods exists. There remains the task of getting thelocal authorities to give large orders for a few well-proven systems.This must be done in a way which will take up the unused capacity and encourage the development of those reliable systems which savesubstantial manpower and which because of the location of the factories can make the maximum early contribution to regionalbuilding requirements.9, This implies putting limits on the number of systems fromwhich local authorities in any area make their choice. The NationalBuilding Agency will help with the selection of systems and I shallencourage local authorities, by circular and by individual approaches,to make full use of the Agency&apos;s services and advice. In this work  the Economic Planning Councils in the regions will clearly havea valuable contribution to make. I shall also make it plain to the
authorities, in allocating additional approvals for this year, that theincrease must be matched by additional use of industrialised methodschosen from a list limited to the best available local systems. I shallapply the same rule when I ask for programmes covering the next four years. To direct and co-ordinate all these measures, I proposeto appoint someone from the building industry who will devote all his time during the next year to this task.R. H. S. C.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.W.1,19th February, 1965.
