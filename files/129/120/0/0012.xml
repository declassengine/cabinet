IIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPEPvTY OF HSR BPvITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)copy no.      5L929th January, 1965CABINETCOMMONWEALTH IMMIGRATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentCertain categories of Commonwealth citizen have a legal rightunder the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 to be admitted to theUnited Kingdom..(a) Dependants.    The v/ife of a Commonwealth citizen or a child of his under 16 years of age who comes here with or to join him maynot be refused admission.    We do not know how many people overseasalready have this right, but they cannot number less than half a million.(b) Students.   A Commonwealth citizen is entitled to admission ifhe satisfies the immigration officer that he wishes to enter the UnitedKingdom for the purpose of attending a course of study at a college,school, etc.(c) Visitors.    A Commonwealth citizen is entitled to admissionif he satisfies the immigration officer that he can support himselfwithout taking work.    This category includes tourists and othervisitors as well as a few people of independent means who come tosettle here.(d) Voucher-holders.    Commonwealth citizens who come here for employment should first get a voucher under a scheme administered bythe Minister of Labour.     The vouchers are issued at discretion, butthe holder of a valid voucher is legally entitled to admission.2.      Other Commonwealth citizens are admitted at discretion.   Forexample, at present we readily admit a child under 16 coming with orto join a close relative other than a parent, or a person between 16 and18 years of age coming v/ith or to join a parent.Evasion of the control3.       The demand for vouchers has greatly exceeded the supply,especially since the end of 1963 when the rate of issue began to bereduced, so there is increasing pressure to get round the control.Evasion takes different forms.    One is for the evader to pass himselfoff as a person with a legal right of entry.    He may pretend to be under16 when he is older, or the son of a Commonwealth citizen alreadyhere.    Many of these claims are made more difficult to counterbecause tlioy ira supported by officially issued paocpo-rtc giving falseparticulars, which can be arranged in some countries without much-1-CONFiDENTiAL

difficulty.    Immigration officers defect a number of such attemptsand refuse admission;  but some must succeed.    There is thereforean unknown number of importers among those officially classified as dependants.    /mother device is to pose as a student or a visitor;because of the terms of the statute, a well prepared claim toadmission as a student or a visitor is not easy to resist.    Inaddition, there are genuine students who stay on, whether or not they complete their studies, and genuine visitors who change their minds.    (There is nothing in law to prevent a Commonwealth citizenwho has been unconditionally admitted as a student or a visitor fromstaying on, and this is happening on a considerable scale.)    Thus thenet intake of coloured Commonwealth citizens^ in 1964 exceeded by9,000 the number deliberately admitted for settlement (i. e. asdependants, voucher-holders etc.)4.      The main defence against this type of evasion is for the immigration officer to admit the student or visitor about whom he issuspicious on condition that he leaves the country within a specified time.    There is power under the Act to do this;  but the power hasbeen little used because the means of enforcement are defective.First, there is no good way to keep track of individuals admittedunder conditions:   the Asians in particular melt into their respectivecommunities and the police have been able to find few of those whom they have been asked to look for.     Second, there is no simple powerto enforce the condition, i.e. to require the defaulter, if traced, toleave the country.    It is a criminal offence not to observe such acondition but the defaulter must be convicted of the offence and thecourt must recommend deportation before the Secretary of State can,by deportation, require him to leave the country.The scale of immigration5.       We now have figures for the first two full calendar years ofcontrol under the Act and I give the main statistics in Annex I.    Thenet intake of coloured Commonwealth immigrants during 1964 v/as62,000, nearly 9 per cent higher than in 1963 and about the same degree higher than in I960 when there v/as no immigration control.I think coloured Commonwealth citizens are coming faster than theycan be absorbed into the community and I believe that, despite theeconomic argument that favours more immigrant workers for essential industries and services, we ought to do v/hat we can to reduce therate of flow.6.      Apart from marginal adjustments to the categories of peoplewhom we admit at discretion, v/e can reduce the flow only by -(a) issuing fewer vouchers;  and(b) reducing the scale of evasion of the control.The first we have still to consider in the commonwealth immigration Committee;  the second is the subject of thismemorandum.*Thio expression is used as a term of art to mean thoseCommonv/ealth citizens who are not citizens of Canada, australia or New Zealand.    All the statistics in thin memorandum relate tocoloured Commonwealth citizens.-2-CONFiDENTIALS,

7.      It is my view that we shall not be able to deal effectively withthe main body of thoce who evade the control - those admitted asvisitor&apos;: and students who stay on - under the Act as it stands.    Ithink we should have a wider use of the power to impose time limits on them, and better means of enforcing the limits imposed.    we need power to require Commonwealth citizens to leave identifyingparticulars with immigration authorities and to register with thepolice;  and the Home Secretary should have power to repatriate,without criminal proceedings, a Commonwealth citizen who hasoutstayed the period for which he has been admitted.    But theCommonwealth Immigration Committee are of opinion that, for thepresent at least, we ought not to propose legislation, but should try to cope with evasion by making full use of the existing powers.    Iam proposing therefore to proceed on that basis.8.      Any change of policy ought to be announced in Parliament andin any case we are now being pressed to state what we propose to doin this matter.    A Question by an ex-Minister for 4th February (when shall be top of the list for oral answers) provides an occasion for anannouncement.    The Commonwealth Immigration Committee invited me to settle the terms of the statement in consultation v/ith the lord president, the Commonwealth Secretary and the Colonial Secretary,and the draft attached as Annex II has been prepared in consultationwith those Ministers, the Minister of Labour and the Minister of overseas Development.    I seek authority to make it.Home Office, S.W.I.29th January, 1965CONFIDENTIALN

ANNEX IIMr. FL3TCHE.R-GOOKS (Darwen):  To ask the Secretary of Statefor the Home Department, whether he will seek powers to repatriate Commonwealth immigrants who have entered theUnited Kingdom illegally.For oral answer, Thursday, 4th February, 1965DRAFT reply the Government has taken stepn to initiate Commonwealthdiscussions to review the whole question of Commonwealth immigration.In the meantime, there is evidence that under the existing control someevasion is taking place, and it is therefore necessary to make astricter use of the existing powers of control.    For this purpose freshinstructions are being issued to immigration officers.The fresh instructions will require immigration officers, beforeallowing entry, to subject to the fullest scrutiny, in -whatever cases they judge to be necessary, the intention and bona fides    of commonwealth citizens seeking entry as visitors or students, as wellas the authenticity of their travel documents;  and to make a fulleruse of their power to impose conditions specifying the period forwhich a Commonwealth citizen is admitted as a student or visitor.Secondly, there is evidence that evasion is taking place by those who claim to be entitled to enter as dependants under section 2of the Commonwealth Immigrants A.ct 1962 and immigration officers will examine with greater thoroughness than hitherto has been thought necessary the identity and the validity of the claims of persons whoseek entry under section 2.    Except where very special grounds exist,I am also reviewing the present practice of admitting as a matter of discretion children under 16 coming here to join close relativesresident in this country who are not their parents.Thirdly, we shall, where practicable, be reinforcing the staffsin posts overseas by assigning to them experienced immigration officers to assist in dealing with applications for entry certificates.When persons charged with having evaded the control, or havingfailed to comply with conditions of entry imposed upon thern areprosecuted and convicted and the court in consequence makes adeporta.tion recommendation, effect will of course be given to such recommendations unless there are very strong reasons for making aspecial exception.-5-CONFE DENTS AL

Y;re shall have to wait to see how effective these measures are when in operation before deciding whether any further steps are necessary, and we shall also be in touch with other commonwealth governments.CONFIDENTIAL
