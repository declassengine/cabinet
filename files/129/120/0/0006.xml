THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MA.TESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1965C. (65) 6 Copy No.    5 918th January, 1965CABINETHOSPITAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURE: 1965-66Memorandum by the Minister of HealthSince taking office, my impressions of the inadequacy of thepresent Hospital Plan have been confirmed. The standard of ourhospitals is abysmally low; we can only with difficulty claim to have any modern hospitals; and the present programme is making too little inroad into the problem. On the longer-term implications ofthis I may wish to consult my colleagues when I have completed myreview of the Hospital Plan, which will take several months.2. My immediate need, however, is to draw the Cabinetsattention to the extreme difficulty with which we shall be faced ifexpenditure on hospital building in 1965-66 is held at the figurefixed by our predecessors.3. The background is that the financial programme to whichHospital Boards have been working was settled in 1960 and has notbeen adjusted since except to take account of increases in priceindices. It was from the start seen as an expanding programme andan expansion of  6 million each year (at current prices) was thought to be about as much as was within the planning capacity of theHospital Boards in the early years of the programme.4. In order to achieve even this expansion it was necessary to plan more than was expected to start in order to avoid consistentunderspending. But it has recently become clear that Hospital boards have so improved their speed of planning that they are nowovershooting the targets they were given. They are certainly going tooverspend this year, and I estimate that they will need  68 million for 1965-66 against the  63 million of the programme.5. Because of the difficult financial position which faces us, theChancellor of the Exchequer has felt unable to accede to my request for this additional  5 million in 1965-66. I appreciate his reasons;but against them we have to weigh the political implications of notfinding this additional money. Because of the way in which theoriginal Hospital Plan was drawn up it has been seen by the public5298
and, indeed, by the hospital authorities as a plan for the erection of specific named hospital projects. Moreover, the Hospital boards have been urged to complete the planning of more schemes than could be undertaken within the  63 million. If the programme is limited to that  63 million, the result will be to halve expenditureon new work to be started in the year and to postpone several largeschemes which may have to include the new Cardiff TeachingHospital, the next phase of the Cambridge Teaching Hospital, thenew hospital at Greenwich for which my Ministry is directly responsible and the new Northwick Park Hospital which is so important to the future of medical research in this country. It maybe necessary to postpone some work which has gone to tender.6. Decisions about the particular schemes to be postponedcannot be taken until I have consulted Hospital Boards, but Ihave had to let the Chairmen know in confidence that furtherpostponements may have to be made and that no Region could be spared. They have expressed themselves forcefully and it is clearthat they foresee an outcry all over the country if this happens.Indeed, the impression created both in hospitals and among thepublic will undoubtedly be one of deliberate cuts and &quot; stop-go &quot;,no matter how much we might try to justify the decision by referenceto the expansion in real terms which is taking place, or to lack ofrealism in our predecessors&apos; planning.7. This is a situation which has developed because we havereached the watershed between regular underspending and the ability of Boards to spend in full what is available. We must clearly keepplanning and spending for the future as closely correlated as possible.But the immediate impact, in our first year of office, is that withoutthe additional  5 million I shall be the first Minister of Health to order the postponement of schemes which Boards have been encouraged to plan and which, but for my act, could be started. Atthe time of the earlier revisions of the Plan, the planning of schemeswas postponed, but never the start of those of which the planningwas completed. This would be a sad blow to the reputation of aGovernment which in The Queen&apos;s Speech promised action tomodernise and develop the health services. To the professional staff engaged in planning it would be a blow to morale, and hospital boards who have already lost staff as a result of changes in the plans are likely to lose more if the start of completely plannedschemes is delayed; to the public, it would be a denial of hospitalspromised and urgently required.8. I invite my colleagues to agree that the avoidance of such difficulties justifies, even in the present financial situation, an increasein hospital capital expenditure for 1965-66 of  5 million over the levelagreed for planning in 1960.K.
