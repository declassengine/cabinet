HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)19th February, 1965CABINETPRICES AND INCOMES IN 1965Memorandum by the First Secretary of Stateand Secretary of State for Economic affairs feel bound to bring to my colleagues&apos; attention once again theserious prospects that face us this year on prices and incomes,2.      In the memorandum which I circulated on 3rd February (C. (65) 16)I reported that the average rate of increase in hourly wage rates in 1965would be well over 5 per cent per annum.    This forecast was based onthe fact that over half of all manual workers were due under agreements which had already been negotiated to receive in 1965 improvements in pay and reductions of hours which would together represent an average increase in hourly rates of more than 5 per cent a year.3.      I also reported that the Retail Price Index was expected to riseat an annual rate of at least 3i per cent in 1965.    The latest forecastis for a rise of 4 per cent. ,4.       The Economic Development Committee&apos;s Sub-Committee on prices and Incomes has now received a further report from the Ministerof L.abour about the progress of the movement to a 40 hour week.    the key factor here is the agreement in the engineering industry to move to a40 hour week in July, 1965.    The shipbuilding and electricity supplyindustries also move to a 40 hour week in July.    The docks and the electrical contracting industry are among the industries which have hada 40 hour week for some time.    Claims are now in for hours reductionsfor a large number of workers in the private sector, the nationalised industries and the public services, including postmen, Post Officeengineers and Civil Service industrial workers.    Given the history oflinks with outside engineers for Post Office engineers and for manyCivil Service industrials, we cannot as employers hope to resistreductions to 40 hours for these people this year, however much wedeplore them as a Government trying to implement an incomes policy.We must expect similar developments elsewhere in the public services(notably for local authority manual workers and their counterparts inthe National Health Service) and in the nationalised and private sectors.5.       The effect of reducing the normal working week by two hourswithout reducing the amount of pay for a normal working week is toincrease hourly rates of pay by about 5 per cent.    Total earnings arelikely to rise-by more than this, since the reduction in the normal working week tends simply to result in an increase in the number of-1-

hours worked at overtime rates.    This year the peak of the round of hours reductions is likely to coincide with the normal round of pay increases.   This last happened in I960.    In that year the index ofhourlv wase rates rose bv over 6^r oe^ c^&quot;^ anrl svenup linurlvearnings by over 8 per cent.    This year the level of unemployment is somewhat lower than in I960.    We must expect a sharp rise inhourly wage rates and in earnings.6.      Some of the recently reported pay increases - for instance,the arbitration award of 15s. a week for municipal busmen and of the per cent increase proposed by a Wages Council for road haulageworkers - may well have an immediate effect on prices (bus fares and road haulage rates).    Other increases will work through costs ontoprices.7.       We have to think not only of 1965 but of later years.    Theunions in the printing industry are now seeking a new three1-year agreement.    The increases they are claiming would average over  per cent in each of the three years 1965, 1966 and 1967 (in additionto any cost of living increases) and if conceded could begin to set a pattern.8.      We still have to establish a &quot;norm&quot; for increases in incomes and criteria to guide the National Board for Prices and Incomes in assessing individual cases.   If the new Board is to become an effective element in the machinery for determining prices and incomes in the long-term, confidence in it will have to be establishedfrom the beginning.    As I have warned my colleagues before, we haveto accept that this sets limits to what we can expect of the new machinery by way of effect upon the rise in prices and in money incomes this year,9.      I do not suggest that the Cabinet should discuss these problemsfurther at this stage;  but we shall all need to have these prospects for prices and incomes in our minds as we develop our policies inthe coming months.G.B.Department of Economic Affairs, S, 17. 1.19th February, 1965-2-
