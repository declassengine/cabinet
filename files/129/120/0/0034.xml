THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1965C. (65) 3425th February, 1965CABINETLAND commission memorandum by the Lord President of the council the purpose of this paper is to bring before the Cabinet the major issues that have to be decided before the drafting of the land commission Bill can be completed. These issues have been studied by the Ministerial Committee on Legislation on Rent, land commission and Leasehold Enfranchisement, but they have not beenable to reach complete agreement. They concern principally thefunctions and powers of the Commission and the way in which its operation can be used to help local authorities buying land for socialpurposes and to reduce the cost of house ownership to owner-occupiers.The background.   Our Election Manifesto said:&quot; The first requirement is to end the competitive scramblefor building land. It will therefore set up a Land Commissionto buy, for the community, land on which building or rebuildingis to take place. Instead of paying the inflated market prices that have now reached exorbitant levels, the Crown Land commission will buy the land at a price based on its existing use value plusan amount sufficient to cover any contingent losses by the ownerand to encourage the willing sale of land. The Crown land commission will not, of course, acquire land which continuesto be used for agriculture, nor will it purchase the freehold ofexisting houses or other buildings so long as they remain in theirexisting use.As a result of public acquisition, building land can be madeavailable at cheaper prices; although the land will remain in public ownership, new owner-occupied houses built upon it willremain, under the new &apos; crown hold&apos; system, the absoluteproperty of their owners as long as the house stands.&quot;3. The Ministerial Committee are agreed that the literalimplementation of this programme is impossible. The land commission cannot from the start become the sole purchaser of landfor development. It will have to extend its operations graduallybecause of the administrative task involved, and mainly because it will depend heavily on the services of valuers who are very scarce.Copy No.59
4. If the Commission cannot be the monopoly purchaser, thepresent market will remain. In order to avoid the inequity of a two-price system a lower price paid by the Commission and a higher price paid on the open market it is agreed that there should be alevy on development value whether realised on the sale of land orresidually at the point of development. The Commission would collect the betterment levy on-private transactions and would itself purchaseat market value net of levy. The rate of such a levy is complicated by the prospect of a capital gains tax, as explained later.5. One consequence of the present market continuing is thatthe price of land for housing cannot be artificially reduced. It is the ability to charge scarcity prices for houses which enables developersto pay, and landowners to ask, high prices for land. The price ofland can be reduced effectively only by increasing the supply ofhouses relative to demand. (The cost of the land, as distinct fromthe market price, can, however, be reduced by some concession, suchas a grant to the purchaser. This is discussed later.) Moreover, anyattempt to recover for the community part of the betterment will tend to increase the price of land, because, even if the imposition ofa levy does not make land scarcer, the vendor will seek to pass the levy, or at least a part of it, on to the purchaser.The Commission^ functions and powers6. The scope of the Commission^ functions cannot beconsidered in isolation from the nature of its powers of compulsory purchase, the scale on which it will in practice be able in its early years to buy land, and the effect which the betterment levy (combined with capital gains tax) may be expected to have on the willingness oflandowners to put their land on the market.7. The definition of the Commission^ functions will also define the land which it will have authority to buy (whether by agreementor by compulsion). The provision conferring its compulsory powers will specify the grounds on which it will be open to the landownerto object. These might be that the purpose for which it is sought to buy the land is not within the Commission^ functions; that the landis not necessary or suitable for that purpose; that it is not desirableto develop it in the immediate future; or that the owner has plans and permission for immediate development and consequently. the intervention of the Commission is unnecessary. The less the Billallows room for specific objection the less difficulty there will be inexercising the power (and the less need there may be to do so becauselandowners, seeing little prospect of successful objection, may be content to sell by agreement); but the less the opportunity forobjection the more the provision will be open to attack (particularlyin Parliament) on the ground that it takes too little account of therights and interests of the individual. The Commission^ capacity to buy will in any event be severely restricted in its early years by theshortage of professional staff, who will be required to effect itspurchases, whether by negotiation or agreement. Indeed, if must be
emphasised! that the scarcity of valuers is likely to impose substantiallimitations on the scope of the Commission^ operations for aconsiderable time.O8. Betterment levy will be raised on development value and willbecome payable on sale, or residually at the date of development^2)The amount of the levy will be allowed as an expense in calculatinga particular taxpayer^ capital gains during a tax year for the purposeof the capital gains tax. The combined effect of the levy and thecapital gains tax cannot be determined until the rate of the tax hasbeen fixed; but any levy combined with the introduction of a capital gains tax is bound to be a disincentive to making land available for development. Although a capital gains tax (since it would be basedon the value in April 1965) will not in most cases have a substantialincidence in the early years, psychologically owners of land will be deterred by it as well as by the levy. The problem can perhaps best beconsidered in terms of how much development value the levy andthe tax together will leave in owners&apos; hands. It seems probable thatif landowners are left with less than half the development value, few of them will want to sell. On this basis, if, for example, the capital gains tax were fixed at about 40 per cent, the rate of levy which wouldbe practicable would probably lie between 25 per cent and 35 per cent.It could not be much more.9. In this situation two approaches have been advocated to theCommittee:(i) The Minister of Land and Natural Resources advocatesa comprehensive approach. He would give the land commission powers to acquire any land on which therehas been a planning decision that it is suitable for development (whether planning permission or allocationin a development plan); these powers would bepermissive, not mandatory. Priorities within this fieldwould be laid down by the Minister of Land by direction and could be described in a White Paper. They wouldbe:(1) to bring land forward for development when this isnecessary to serve the needs of national and regional planning; this would include cases wherethe levy is discouraging owners from offering their land for development;(2) to acquire in advance and to assemble land that isrequired to be dealt with comprehensively;(3) to purchase land for industrial and commercial usesthereby providing either for the collection of future betterment or for concessionary disposalif necessary to implement Government policy;i1) The present strength of about 2,000 valuers is some hundreds short of presentrequirements; and the introduction of the Land Commission will increase thedifficulty of recruiting ;more by increasing the demand for valuers in the private sector.(2) The proposed method of calculating development value is indicated in Annex Ito R.L.L. (65) 7.
(4) to purchase land so that it can be made available onconcessionary terms for housing associations andin other ways for private housing.Local authorities would continue to exercise their powersof compulsory purchase, and within these priorities land would be acquired for public authorities only with their agreement or, otherwise, with the consent of the Minister.The Minister of Land proposes that these comprehensivepov/ers should be matched by compulsory purchaseprocedure which would allow the landowner to objectto compulsory purchase only on the ground that the landin question ought not to be developed in the foreseeable future; and successful objection would lead to automaticrevocation of planning permission without compensation.(ii) The Minister of Housing and Local Government advocatesa limited approach. This would confine the Commission^functions initially to collecting the levy and to purchasingland where it was necessary to do so:(a) to    bring    it    forward    for    development    or redevelopment;(b) to     secure     comprehensive     development     or redevelopment;(c) to make it available for the functions of any public authority.It would be open to a landowner to object to a compulsory purchase on the ground that the acquisitionof the land by the Commission was not necessary for oneof these purposes-e.g., because it was about to be developed privately.10. In favour of the comprehensive approach it is argued thatif the combined effect of the levy and the capital gains tax is suchas to cause landowners to withhold land, it will be essential to havethe strong powers of compulsory purchase which this schemeenvisages. Faced with the revocation of planning permission if theyobjected successfully to compulsory purchase, landowners would prefer to sell voluntarily, either privately or to the Commission. the stronger powers would, it is argued, be more likely to deterlandowners from withholding their land, and owners would be lessinclined to challenge the compulsory purchase powers. On thisreasoning, compulsory powers would have to be invoked to a greater extent under the limited approach; and to offset this it would therefore be necessary under the limited approach to reduce thedisincentive to owners by reducing substantially the rate of levy.If the Commission had only limited powers there would be a real risk of a period during which the supply of land might be restricted,particularly affecting small builders who are responsible for asizeable part of private housing. If the effect of the levy in the earlier years were thus to disrupt the private building programme, theCommission would be discredited and there would never be asecond phase.
11. It is also argued in favour of the comprehensive approachthat the Land Commission ought to have, from the beginning of theoperations, a range of constructive purposes for which it wouldacquire land. It would only be able to pursue these objectives on asmall scale at first and would have to build up gradually. but without these purposes, it would be seen that in the first stage theCommission was only acquiring land in order to enforce the levy.12. In favour of the limited approach, it is said that theCommission will not in practice be able to buy land extensively inits early years because purchase, whether by compulsion or by negotiation, requires the services of valuers who will not be availablein sufficient numbers to support a widespread exercise of theCommission^ powers. Consequently, if the supply of land for housing and other social purposes is not to dry up, the levy must be fixed ata rate which, having regard to any capital gains tax, will not causeland to be withheld on a greater scale than the Commission, on a realistic assessment of its capabilities, can be expected to overcome.It is suggested that the major factor in causing land to be withheldor brought forward will be the landowners&apos; expectations about the likelihood of the levy being changed. If it starts high his only hopewill be that a change of Government will reduce (or remove) it andhe will be tempted to hold on to his land. If it starts low with thepossibility of an increase, he will be more willing to sell. It is suggestedthat the compulsory purchase powers proposed under the limitedapproach, would be sufficient to sustain a moderate rate of levy inaddition to any capital gains tax, and that the fear of an increaselater would counteract any tendency to hold off. It is further argued that, since the Commission will not in practice be able to purchaseland on a large scale, it is politically unwise to confer on it initiallythe wide functions necessary to enable it to do so, functions which arelikely to suggest widespread and arbitrary interference with the rightsof the individual.13. If the Bill were to contain all the Commission^ purposes and powers, the Commission would nevertheless have to expand its operations gradually, and the question remains whether the legislation should confer wide functions on it initially or proceed by stages.Should the Bill be framed(a) as proposed by the Minister of Land so as to give theCommission wide functions and drastic compulsory purchase powers from the outset, but make clear thatits functions would be limited by Ministerial direction,in accordance with the priorities mentioned inparagraph 9 (i); or(b) limit the functions at the outset to those set out inparagraph 9 (ii), but provide for the wide functionsadvocated by the Minister of Land to be conferred after asecond appointed day fixed by order subject to affirmative resolution?The Committee were agreed that there would be no advantage ingoing further and providing for a stage at which land coming intodevelopment would be vested automatically in the Commission.
Finance14. It is not easy to forecast what the proceeds of a bettermentlevy might be. But as a rough guide the gross proceeds of a levy at20 per cent of development value might be about  12 million^1) 25 millionC) and  40 million in 1967, 1968 and 1969, respectively.At a 35 per cent rate of levy the figures might be  20 million^1) 40 millionC) and  68 million. These gross figures take no accountof administrative and management costs.15. These estimates would not of course represent the net. cashposition of a Land Commission. On any likely assumptions aboutthe scale and terms of a Commission^ purchases and sales.of land and making no allowance for concessionary disposal, its overalloperations would be unlikely to show a significant return for anumber of years.Disposal of land by the Commission(a) Local authorities16. The Ministerial Committee contemplate that localauthorities will in the main continue to use their own powers of compulsory purchase to obtain the greater part of the land they need. It will not often be appropriate for the Commission to buyland simply to sell to a local authority, but when it does it should both buy and sell at market value. The question then arises how bestthe levy paid by the vendor of land purchased by or for a localauthority can be used either to reduce the cost of land to authorities or to give them financial help in other ways. Should there be anygrant specifically related to the cost of land as an element of the costof a particular service? If so, should the amount of the grant reflect the amount of levy paid by the vendor on a particular transaction, orthe total amount of levey collected, or should the grant be determinedby criteria applied in determining other forms of grant andparticularly take account of the needs of the poorer authorities?Should a grant, however determined, be paid separately by the land commission?17. Administratively it seems preferable to avoid a direct grantrelated either to the cost of, or the levy on, particular land purchasesor to the total receipts from the levy. The first would be haphazardin its operation and would tend to benefit the richer authorities ratherthan the poorer; the history of the Road Fund sufficiently illustrates the dangers of the second. On the other hand, it is importantpolitically that authorities should be able to see that they areobtaining additional help as a consequence of the operation of theLand Commission. At an assumed rate of levy between 30 per cent(x) The proceeds in the first years after the levy is introduced will be relatively small; a considerable amount of development value will have been taken: intransactions before the appointed day and this will mean a lower overall return fromany given rate of levy.
and 40 per cent, it is estimated that, when the levy is fully operative,the total amount of levy related to all local authority transactionswould be about  36 million gross. This would be a relatively small amount if it was distributed through the same channels as the 1,000 million a year at present paid out in grants to local authorities for their many different kinds of expenditure.18. The problem will have to be discussed with the localauthorities (who will not necessarily prefer a grant directly related to the levy); but discussions should take place in the context of thereviews now in progress of housing subsidies, of methods of helpinglocal authorities to undertake urban redevelopment and of central and local government finance generally, and of the legislation inwhich these reviews are likely to result next Session. It follows thatno decision can be reached before the introduction of the land commission Bill and that the Bill should leave the way open to thepayment of grants by the Land Commission in case that should seemappropriate in the light of the consultations.19.  The Ministerial Committee therefore recommend:(i) that the Bill should confer power on the Land Commissionto make grants towards local authority land purchases insuch circumstances and on such scale as the Minister ofLand may by regulations direct;(ii) that the White Paper on the Bill should explain that assistance derived from the levy would be channelled tothe local authorities in a manner to be discussed withthem in the light of the current reviews of localgovernment finance and of the consequent legislation;(iii) that in the meantime we should avoid any commitment on either the manner or the amount of assistance that willbe given to local authorities as a consequence of theestablishment of the Land Commission.(b) Private occupiers: crownhold20. Our objectives, as stated in the Manifesto, were to providefor private housing a form of tenure to be called &quot; crown hold &quot;, whichwould(i) ensure that land could be made available cheaper; and(ii) that the ownership of the land would remain with the Crownso that future development value would accrue to thecommunity.There are broadly two ways of doing this. One is to provide landeither on a long lease or on a covenanted freehold the interest inwhich would be non-assignable. A covenanted freehold might involvea new form of tenure; a long lease would not. The Land commission would have a right to repurchase on change of occupier, or if theland was required for redevelopment, on equitable terms, which wouldrequire further study but would probably include the payment to thecrownholder of not less than the amount the house would fetch
on the market without prospects of further development, but alsowithout threat of dispossession. The value&apos;of the original concession should be deducted from the compensation. The advantages of thisscheme would be(i) that it would enable the concession to be made to successiveoccupiers of the land; and(ii) that it would ensure that the concession could not be turnedinto cash profit by the recipient.It would have the disadvantage that it would be necessary for theCommission to repurchase on every change of occupier (because onlyso could the first occupier be prevented from obtaining the cashvalue of the concession from the private purchaser of the crown hold)and to select the next person to enjoy the concession. This wouldinvolve the Land Commission in considerable management functions,and would require the services of valuers and others who for someyears to come are unlikely to be available in sufficient numbers.21. The alternative would involve a new type of tenure, withfeatures of both freehold and leasehold. The freehold would belong to the Land Commission, but the crownholder would have an interest which would last for the duration of the life of the house and wouldthen come to an end. Meanwhile he would enjoy virtually all therights and independence of a freeholder. The crownholder coulddispose of the property in any way, but only subject to the ultimateright of the Land Commission to reacquire it for redevelopment.He would be entitled to call upon the Land Commission to reacquirethe property from him if he could not sell it. The amount paid tothe crownholder by the Land Commission on repurchase in either of these situations would be the value of the house for the remainder of its estimated natural life (that is, the estimated life of the buildingbefore it ceased to be habitable assuming there was no redevelopment).Owing to the limited and uncertain duration of the crownholder&apos;interest, its market value, except possibly in areas of acute shortage,would be less than that of the freehold. His interest would of coursedepreciate towards the end of the life of the house, but it would offer the advantage that he would obtain security for occupation at lesscost, he would have no landlord and pay no rent, and he would beable to dispose of his interest or borrow on it. The advantage tothe Land Commission would lie in this form of crown hold involvinglittle or no management functions and the minimum of expense.Moreover, a crown hold nearer to freehold than to leasehold wouldbe less inconsistent with the Government^ policy of leasehold enfranchisement.22. The second scheme would involve much less work for theCommission. Under either scheme it would be necessary forcrownhold to be made available direct to the occupier because therewould be no means of preventing a builder or developer fromconverting the concession into profit. The fact that the commission would be dealing direct with occupiers, however, might lead toawkward questions of Ministerial and Parliamentary responsibility.
The Commission itself could engage, certainly at first, in the provisionof houses only on a limited scale, because it would not have theresources to act both as a purchaser of land and as a large-scalemanager of house property. Consequently it would have to work through agencies, perhaps local authorities and housing associations,operating itself in areas where local authorities were unwilling to playthis part and no suitable housing association was available. The cashvalue of the concession the Commission would make would not be great in relation to the total cost of an owner-occupier house; perhaps 75- 150 depending on the price of the land. It is doubtful how manypurchasers would wish to take advantage of such a scheme, though itmight in time provide a useful percentage of private enterprisehousing. crown hold should be seen, however, as one of a number of measures adopted to help the owner-occupier and not as the solesolution to their problem.23. The Ministerial Committee consider that either of these schemes might be an acceptable basis for crown hold. they recommend that the Bill should empower the Commission to makeland available for owner-occupiers either through housing associations or local authorities or direct on crown hold terms, but thedetails of crown hold should be further considered before the Bill is introduced.Interim arrangements24. It is necessary to ensure that the Land Commissionbecomes effective as soon as possible with the minimum of disruptionto the orderly process of development. How soon it will be practicable for the Commission to operate depends partly on whether the Bill can be passed this Session and partly on the availability of valuers, who will be required to make valuations forthe purposes both of the levy and of purchases by the Commission.Valuers are still heavily engaged on appeals arising from the 1963rating revaluation. The 1968 revaluation will have to be abandoned,but even so January 1967 is the earliest date at which sufficientvaluers will be available to ensure that the initial stages of theCommission^ work are reasonably smooth. If the appointed day isearlier, we shall have to accept the risk of serious delays in thevaluers&apos; work both for the Commission and for other departments and local authorities. Even so, the earliest date which would beremotely possible would be July 1966.25. During the interval between the introduction of the bill and the appointed day fear of the Commission^ actions may causebuilders to be reluctant to buy land, and small builders, who holdlittle or no stock of land but account for a high proportion of privateenterprise housing, may switch to maintenance work, with a serious loss of houses. At the same time desire to reap development valuebefore the levy operates will cause builders who have stocks of land to start as much building as possible. This could disrupt theconstruction industries and further reduce the output of completedhouses.
26.  The Ministerial Committee recommend:(a) that land transactions during the period between theintroduction of the Bill and the appointed day shouldbe disregarded for assessing levy;(b) that builders should be allowed to develop free of levystocks of -land for which there is planning permissionwhich are in their possession or subject to a firm contractat the date of introduction. Further consideration will need to be given to the question whether this concession should be subject to a time limit.Summary27.  The questions for consideration are:(i) Is the Land Commission to be given(a) wide functions and powers of compulsory purchaseallowing little opportunity for objection (the comprehensive approach paragraph 9 (i)), or(b) initially limited functions and less drastic powers of compulsory purchase (the limited approach-paragraph 9 (ii))?(ii) If (b), should the wide functions and powers envisaged inthe comprehensive approach be conferred in the Billafter a second appointed day fixed by order subject to affirmative Resolution (paragraph 13)?(iii) Should the question of assistance to local authorities bedealt with as recommended in paragraph 19?(iv) Would either of the schemes proposed in paragraphs 20and 21 be acceptable in principle as a basis forcrownhold?(v) Are the interim arrangements recommended in paragraph26 acceptable?H.
