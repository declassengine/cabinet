rC.(65) 20 COPY NO.3 g10th February, 1965CABINETAID TO ZAMBIAJoint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations and the Minister of Overseas DevelopmentWe are confronted by the need to take an urgent decision aboutaid to Zambia.2.       The situation is analysed in the attached note which has beenprepared by officials.    Briefly the Zambians resent what they regard as the financial &quot;injustice&quot; of the settlement reached when the Federationof Rhodesia and Nyasaland was dissolved and claim that they onlyagreed to it on receiving from Her Majesty&apos;s Government what theyunderstood as a promise to give substantial aid.3.       There was in fact no such commitment by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment but there is no doubt they genuinely believe there was andwe consider that the Zambian resentment can only be removed by an offer of aid from Her Majesty,&apos;s Government.    Although, on a strictmeans test basis the case for financial aid to Zambia is not strong,at any rate at present, we believe that for both economic and political reasons it is necessary to make an offer now.    Our reasons are asfollows - /4.       President Kaunda is in a difficult political position in his own country.    He is a moderate African friendly to the West but many ofhis colleagues have leanings towards the East and would like to acceptthe offers of aid being pressed upon them by the Bloc.    He is keepinghis colleagxies at bay by a delicate balancing act.    In his foreignpolicy of strict non-alignment the United States is weighed in one scaleagainst the Soviet Union and China in the other.    But President Kaundabadly needs an unmistakable manifestation of British support in con-crete terms now.    If he has to give way to his colleagues our whole position in Central Africa will be rapidly eroded, the expatriates inthe civil service will be displaced and the Europeans will leave thecopper belt.    British industry might well be faced with an inter-ruption of our main source of copper and the large stake we have inthe Zambian copper industry might well be jeopardised.    We might also be confronted with a total collapse of the administration.5.       We cannot in our view afford to take these risks, and theproblem is therefore to find the solution which achieves our general political objective at minimum cost to us.    We believe that the best course to this end is alternative (b) of the officials&apos; paper - i. e. tooffer Zambia a comprehensive settlement of  10 million over fiveyears.    We do not think we should attempt at this stage to decide what it should be used for nor when it should be drawn.    We shall haveto consider President Kaunda?s request to us to help Zambia in her-1-CONRDENTiAL[S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)

contingency planning (particularly in stockpiling coal) against a denial of coal supplies by Southern Rhodesia in the event of a unilateral declaration of Independence.    Again it is in our own interests to giveZambia some defence aid to build up her own internal security.    Andlastly the most urgent problem affecting Zambia&apos;s development is to induce the expatriate officers in the Government to stay on for afurther two or three years, and this may mean some payments from her Majesty&apos;s Government.    All these, if they materialise, shouldbe a charge against the  10 million.    Although some payments mayhave to be made in the earlier part of the five year period, our aimv/ould be to defer the expenditure so far as possible to the later yearsof the period so as to minimise the burden to the economy in the early years.    As much as possible of the aid would be tied to British goods and services.6.       The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, while recognising thepolitical arguments, considers that it would be very difficult in ourpresent economic situation for the Government to announce in theimmediate future aid of this magnitude and duration.    He considersthat the furthest we should go is to offer no more than what is requiredto be spent in the next twelve months - perhaps  2 million on defence and public service aid - together with an undertaking to review theposition at this time next year47.       We do not agree with this view.    Not only would a sum of 2 million entirely fail to achieve the desired political effect but itwould not cover any contingency planning aid, which would have to be additional, and this combined with a commitment to review theposition next year might well prove to be more expensive to theUnited Kingdom taxpayer than the  10 million once-for -all settlementwe now propose.8.      We therefore ask our colleagues to agree that we should beauthorised to offer the Zambian Government a sum of  10 million in defence and economic aid over the next five years, the purposes and timing of this aid to be subsequently agreed between our Governments.A.

FINANCIAL AID,TALKS \VITH_ZAfjBIAFSg^UA^Y^J^5(Note &quot;by the jf&amp;jiistJSC of 0ver seas Development&apos;)A,    HISTORICAL background.     When arrangements for the Dissolution of the Federationof Rhodesia and Nyasaland were being made, the Government ofthe then Colony of Northern Rhodesia contended that duringFederation they had been mulcted of their high copper revenuesfor the benefit of the other two territories (they have sinceproduced figures alleging that over the nine years of federation the contributions of Northern Rhodesia to Federal revenueexceeded &quot;by about 575 million the benefits the territory receivedfrom Federal expenditure).    They therefore resisted the alloca-tion to them on a proportional basis of  18,37^ million of theex-Federal public debt in respect of Federal expenditure incurred on capital works in the territory,  and considered that its acceptance would amount to payment for the same things twice.They also objected to the allocation to Southern Rhodesia, with-cut financial readjustment, of defence assets worth  2,933 million.In all, therefore, they considered that the financial arrange-ments made on Dissolution operated to their disadvantage to theextent of about  21 million.    They also foresaw difficulty in meeting their liability of  10 million to redeem or refinancea railway debt (which they agreed, to share equally with SouthernRhodesia) since this will involve an exceptionally heavy prog-ramme of public debt repayment and refinancing in the years1970-72,3,    BRJ-TISH; PLEDGES2,      In order to break the impasse caused by these and other difficulties in November-December, 1963, H.M.6,  gave an under-taking to both Rhodesias that they (H.M.G.) would be ready toenter into discussions with botr Governments as soon as- mightbe conveniently possible with the specific object of establishingin the light of the nature and extent of the financial burdensassumed by Southern/Northern Rhodesia and the resources avail-able to meet them, the reasonable needs of the territory and themeans whereby the burdens might be lightened,  including Britishaid where necessary in accordance with paragraph 27 of the victoria Falls Report,3.     Paragraph 27 of the Victoria Falls Report (copy at Annex a)stated that the question whether the U.K. Government could andshould help would have to be considered in the light of their general policies on overseas aid towards countries which showedneed for assistance in the development of their economies.    Suchneed would have to be considered in the light of the territory&apos;economic position as a whole - including, of course, the debtburden (H.M.G.  subsequently agreed that this included theparticular problem of the phasing of the railway debt).4. The Zambians have always claimed (and this was repeated byDr. Kaunda to Mrs. Castle in November, 19&apos;6k) that they had onlyaccepted the apportionment of the - Federal public debt on receivingfrom H.M.G. what they interpreted as. a promise to give substan-tial aid, and chat they would not have agreed to the apportion-merit had the emphasis on need been clearly put to them.    We do/not1.

not accept this interpretation, hut the Zambians appear to besincere in their view of the matter.    This is a dilemma whichwas left unresolved at the end of Dr. Kaunda&apos;s visit to london in November, 1964.C.    AID SOUGHT, GIVEN AND PROMISED TO ZAMBIA IN 19645.     In April, 136k, encouraged by.the British pledges given inDecember, 1963, the Northern Rhodesia Government asked H.M.G. foraid totalling  20.5 million (almost entirely in respect of 1964/65)Details of their requests and of our interim response in July, 196mare as follows.Purpose J?0^   .        .,GiTfn  ,?al^ce*  ^million-        ^million        &quot;million for ex-FederaldebtTowal^ds Z amb i a&apos; shalf share ofcompensation toHMOCS officers for development for DefenceThese requests were associated with revenue predictions for:   1964/65 which have since turned out to be under-estimates bysome  20- 25 million.6.      In addition to zhe  5.75 million capital aid listed above,we also promised In November, 1964 to give  1 million to Zambia&apos;snew University.   We also undertook to pay  2 million to the chartered Company as our share towards compensation on therelinquishment of their mineral royalty rights.    This payment is classified by the Treasury as &quot;aid&quot; but would undoubtedly not beso regarded by the Zambia Government.    We are providing technical assistance under O.S.A.S.  (including compensation payments) andS.C.A.A.P to the value of about  2 million.    During 1964/65, there-fore, our total &quot;aid&quot; to Zambia, disbursed or committed, will amount to  10.75 million.7.     The situation as at November, 1964, therefore, was asfollows:-(a) Zambia:had complained that the Dissolutionfinancial arrangements had operated to theirdetriment to the extent of  21 million;(b) their: claim submitted in Spring, 1964 v/as for the very similar sum of  20.5 million;/(e)2.10	(grant)	2.75	7.25	(grant)4	(loan)	3	1-	(loan)2 2	(loan) (grant)	-	2 2	(loan) (grant)2.5			2.5 TXTfB&quot; 3	(grant) fgrant) (loan)20.5		5.75	14.75	

(c)   H.M.G. had paid or promised to Zambia atotal of  10.75 million in aid or other payments, of which  5.75 million relateddirectly to the  20.5 million claim,,8.     During the period March/December, 1964? however, Zambianrevenue prospects improved by about  20- 25 million.    There is thus at least a prima facie case for contending on economicg&apos;rounds; and on a strict interpretation of our Dissolution under-t airings in paras.  2 and 3 above, that Zambia has no case for aidon the basis of need, and that it is unreasonable for her to look to us for any further financial assistance in present circumstances.D.    ZAMBIA!S CUBHE3ST,.REQUEST FOR AID9.      Zambia!s case for aid rests substantially, although not entirely, on political grounds.    This is made clear in theapplication submitted in the Spring of 1964s and in the newapplication recently received.    It was also emphasised by Dr.Kaunda on his visit to London in November, 1964.    He and hisGovernment consider that H.M.G. are still under a strong moral obligation to afford Zambia some relief with her public debt.    Inthe Zambian view, the application to this request for aid of theusual criterion of need is irrelevant,  as this is a debt of honour(&quot;justice money&quot;) owed by us.    Zambia bitterly resents both thechannelling of her copper revenues to the Federal Treasury andthe Dissolution financial arrangements,  in which she acquiescedonly in the belief that we would in fact provide substantial assistance in pursuance of our Dissolution undertakings.    Sherepresents that she has particularly pressing needs in the fields of defence and technical assistance (including help in retaining the services of expatriate officials),  in both of which she would prefer to turn to Britain rather than to other countries;    alsothat she will need some form of long term guarantee for hereconomy in the early 1970&apos;s, by which time her capital development programme should have substantially increased, with a consequent increase in recurrent expenditure, and at which time railway debtsmature which may cost her up to an additional  10.million.10.   Whilst it is possible to say,  in general terms, that Zambiais seeking relief for the burden of Federal debt (&quot;justice&quot;money), assistance in refinancing the railway loans,  defence aid,and technical assistance,  it is less easy to see precisely whattotal amount they are asking for or- how they wish it to be made up.The Zambian application Is in fact a confusing document whichdoes not make clear what is being asked for and is not easilycomparable with previous Zambian claims and statistics.11.    On the basis, however, of all the information available tous we deduce that we are being asked for:-(a)  14.75 million to redress the injustice ofthe Dissolution settlement;    about  2.5- 2.9 m.to be spent on defence:(b) a guarantee to act as lender of last resortin the event of Zambia being unable to redeemor refinance the railway debt of  10 million in 1970-72;3.

(c)    technical assistance;    in particular, help inretaining expatriate officers (see Section Ibelow),E-    ECONOMIC MERITS OP CLAIM12.    Zambia does not need immediate financial assistance to meet its Transitional Development Plan, 1965-66.    This is admittedin the aid application.    Their case for aid rests mainly onhistorical grounds, as already explained.    But the Zambiansargue that in default of substantial assistance in the provisionof foreign exchange, the situation will arise in 1970 onwardswhere the demand for more external currencies (to acceleratedevelopment) will become intense just at the moment when theformer Federal debts become due for repayment;    and that therewould &quot;be serious social and political consequences if,  in anti-cipation of that situation, a &quot;brake had to be put on developmentnow in&quot;order to be able to meet those repayments.13.   Even if this argument were valid, it is questionable whether any financial aid is actually ^eeded now,  (or could be usedexcept perhaps for immediate defence expenditure),    foreign exchange reserves are high and climbing.    To supply furtherquantities of freely available currency would be likely toencourage the Zambian Government to undertake projects of doubt-ful or low economic value.    It is true that the reserves willstop climbing and start to decline in the years ahead.    By 1970or 1971 Zambia will probably need an inflow of capital.    Thishowever is perfectly normal for a developing country and at anyrate as far as new capital formation is concerned should not present insuperable difficulty provided that a sound developmentpolicy has been followed in the meantime.lh. The conclusion is that Zambia has no need on economic grounds for financial assistance at present.P.    CASE FOR AID TO ZAlffilA. .15.    The dilemma presented by the present Zambian.request is that,although no case for aid based on need can reasonably be made,and a refusal to make any further contribution could be justified by strict interpretation of the various undertakings given in the context of Dissolution, such a refusal would have serious political consequences.16.    The present Zambia Government is delicately balanced.    while there is no doubt that the President is by inclination friendly to the West and conscious of the damage which would be done to zambia if his Government were to adopt policies which produced a mass exodus of European administrators and technicians, thesame cannot be said of members of his Cabinet.    Many of them areprepared to be convinced that the British Government is in fo.ctanxious to befriend them but will look for a substantial counter-balance to the damage which they consider to have been done to zambia&apos;s development by the British-imposed Federation.    Theyare, moreover, keenly conscious of the pressures for more rapidAfricanisation which they will only be able to resist if theycan show that the present policies pay dividends.    In the view -of the C..R.-0. a rapid increase in the rate of Africanisationwould cause; Zambia&apos;s &quot;non-alignment&quot;; now a genuine neutralitywith, full and friendly relations with Britain and- the West, tobecome positively anti-British and anti-Western in the manner/which

which many of the President&apos;s Ministers would already prefer.This would mean the abandonment of the Zambia Government&apos;s presentrefusal to arm and train refugees from Rhodesia and the Portugueseterritories.    It would make the Rhodesian problem harder to solve17.   Rapid Africanisation would also produce a serious admin-istrative decline and a threat to the safety of those Europeanswho remained.    Such a decline, together with a weakening of resistance to communist penetration would set at risk the considerable British interest in the copper industry (in which total investment is roughly valued at  170 million, producing an annualreturn of about  10 million).    Repercussions for our own economycould be substantial;    and it is not too much to say that thefuture of the copper belt as a major supplier to British industrydepends on the maintenance of good political relations with theZambia Government.18.    Above all, the C.R.O. consider that it is important not tounderestimate the deep sense of bitterness which all the ZambianMinisters share at what they regard as the injustice of the dissolution settlement.    If.we do not offer substantial aid (andwe have an unusually free hand in deciding the form which thisshould take) the balance in the Zambia Government is likely totip decisively away from us.    Some of the consequence a. of sucha shift are: suggested above.19. The C.R. 0. regard it as vital, therefore, in preparing forthe next round of discussions with the Zambia Government, thatit should be appreciated how precarious is the current, potentialities-tially sound, political and economic structure and how helpful to the preservation of this structure would be a British offer of substantial aid.20.    The Ministry of Defence emphasise the desirability of preventing a breakdown of law and order so as to avoid the dangerof our being called upon to intervene militarily either in supportof the Zambia Government or to carry out a rescue operation forBritish subjects.    They also auppo-rt a grant of British aid asa means of preserving overflying and staging facilities.    Theseare important both in the context of reinforcement of the threeSouthern African Territories, arid of the need to keep openalternative.worldwide reinforcement routes.G.    BASIS OF OUR APPROACH TO THE AID TALKS21.    It is apparent from the foregoing that there is little or no economic case for giving further financial aid to Zambia atthe present time, and that they are able to meet their externalliabilities and to make reasonable provision for development fromtheir- own resources,    Nor would we wish, or think it right, to reopen the whole Dissolution settlement on which the Zambiansclaim for  1^.75 million is primarily based.   We regard the zambian approach and their claim for aid of this order asunrealistic and unacceptable.    On the other hand, the C.R.O.consider that there is a strong political case for giving someaid.    The remainder of this paper is therefore concerned withthe possible quantification of this case and with the selection of appropriate items on which to spend whatever aid we might decide to give.- /H.    DEFENCE AID5.

H.    DEPEgCE AID22.    The C.R.O.  consider that the Zambia Government could appropriately he authorised to apply up to  2 million of whatevertotal aid is finally agreed to defence projects.    Aid of this order would go a fair way towards meeting the Zarribian claim for financial readjustment in respect of the  2.933 million of defenceassets allocated to Southern Rhodesia, and their Spring 196Urequest for aid of  2.5 million for defence requirements.    Thereare objections to the provision of British funds for (as ori-ginally requested) the purchase of such things as Canadian air-craft and the construction of the Lusaka Air base which would include a large local cost element.    It is possible, however, that within the Zambian projected military expenditure for the periodof the interim development plan,  items to a total value of about.. 1 million might be identified which would involve expenditure&quot;on British goods and services.    If the period of expenditure could be extended,, this sum could probably be increased to  2 m.This might have the effect of laying a foundation for a continuingmarket in British goods and would also help to maintain law andorder without which sound economic development is impossible.Should it prove impracticable, within whatever period of time may be agreed,  to tie  2 million worth of defence aid to british goods and services,  it is suggested&quot; that further consideration should be given to the extent to which any defence aid might beused to meet local costs,  or even to switching part of this aid to economic development projects with a high import content(although this would be less satisfactory to the CR.0.  in viewof the importance attached to a substantial part of our aid beingidentified with defence)1 *    TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LAND ZAMBIA&apos; S.. MANPOWER PROBLEM23.    It has been emphasised by the Zambia Government, by theU.N./E.C.A./F.A.0. Economic Commission chaired by Mr. Dudley Seers,end by our High Commission in Lusaka that, during the next fewyears, Zambia&apos;s skilled manpower&quot;&apos; problem will be acute and that assistance in this field is a top priority.    There are two problems in this field on which we need to reach a decision.2h,.    At present we support under O.S.A.S.  about 1,900 designatedofficers in Zambia at a cost (apart from compensation) of about 750,000 per annum.    The Zambia Government have recently, without proper consultation with us, introduced new salary scales which affect both the relative position of designated officers and themethod of calculating the inducement allowance that we pay underO.S.A.S.    The Zambia Government maintain that through the applica-tion of these new scales at least  250,000 per annum more shouldbe paid to them under the principles of the O.S.A. S.   We do notat present accept this.    The Zambia Government, however, maintain their contention str:ngly and our case while strong, is not wholly supported by precedent.    If therefore Ministers considerthat there is a general political case for aid, the advantage inconceding this particular case should be weighed against other possible forms of aid.25.    The number of designated officers is declining because of theZambia compensation scheme end while recruitment for Zambia is fairly satisfactory,  it is insufficient to replace the full wastage.There are also serving the Zambia Government about 1,500 expatriatepensionable officers not acceptable to us for designation underO.S.A.S.    We are advised that under the scheme of retirementbenefits provided for them by the Zambia Government, a majority; /of

of these officers may leave prematurely in 1966, when the induce-ments to further service under this scheme cease to have effect.The Zambia Government wishes to retain, the officers, butexpresses itself politically unable to offer further inducementsand has therefore asked us to provide these inducements by ascheme for topping up the officers&apos; salaries, perhaps by about 500 per man per annum.    In principle it is desirable to encouragethese officers to remain in -Zambian service, but since the ZambiaGovernment&apos;s new salary scales already put the officers about ona par with the designated officers,  it is not clear what further-inducement, if any, should be provided.   Factors affecting adecision would be -(a) an estimate of &quot;the likely practical effect in retaining a proportion of these officersof even further financial inducement;    and(b) the effect on the Zambia Government in thegeneral context of aid talks of some offer to help them on this issue(c) the effect of such further inducement onO.S.A.S. salaries and on the remuneration of non-designated expatriates in other territories (Aden, Southern Rhodesia, Malawi,High Commission Territories).    If a form ofterminal benefit were suggested, the effecton the Federal Public Service settlement which excludes terminal compensation by H.M.G.would also have to be considered.26.    The Zambia Government do not consider that the increasedsalary which they are providing for the non-designated officers will provide sufficient inducement to these officers to stay,or that it overtakes President Kaunda&apos;s verbal request to theMinister of Overseas Development, that the British Governmentshould provide some further inducement for this purpose,27.    It is desirable to reach a conclusion on these Public Servicequestionsj and Ministers&apos;authority is therefore sought to ourinforming the Zambian Government that we are prepared if they wish to include these questions in the discussion of their application for aid.J.    DEVELOPMENT28,    The Zambia Government has recently published a new develop-ment plan envisaging expenditure of about  35 million during thetwo-year period mid-196li- to mid-1966.    They emphasise that theirpland aim at stimulus not merely of the public sector of Zambia&apos;economy, but of the private sector as well.    The Zambian Govern-ment admits it is able to finance both this development plan(which, incidentally, includes no provision for the much di-scussedTanzania/Zambia rail link), and also the earlier part of anysucce-ssor development plan, from its own resources, and our con-clusion is that we should not be justified on economic grounds in recommending any general development aid for Zambia at the presenttime.    If, however, British financial aid were being made availablefor political reasons, the fields of education, housing and agri-culture (where the aid could be identifiably British) offerpossibilities where our help might also be linked to british goods and services.    An example is the possible Zambian requirement for agricultural, tractors, in connection with a scheme for agri-cultural mechanisation which Dr. Kaunda mentioned to us last november. -, ^

K.    PUBLIC DEBT29.    The public debt position is analysed in Annex B.    The ZambiaGovernment Is concerned lest increased capital and recurrent expenditure;,  coupled with the maturity of railway debt in theearly 1970&apos;s,  should create grave financial difficulties at thattime.    They are anxious not to have to cut back their development plans now, in anticipation of a serious crisis in the 1970&apos;s,  and accordingly seek some guarantee of assistance at that stage should it prove necessary.   We are also asked to &quot;act as lender of last resort&quot; in respect of the  10 million railway debt if the ZambianGovernment are unable to make funds available in the 1970&apos;s with-out limiting its general development plans.30,    There is no immediate financial need in respect of debtredemption or refinancing and It may be doubted whether Zambiawill be capable of carrying out and expanding her development programme on the scale which seems to be implied in their applica-tion.    The financial burdens and needs of Zambia in the 1970&apos;scannot be foreseen with any precision, end we. do not consider thatwe can recommend,- even on political grounds, that H.M.G.  should enter into any detailed forward commitments at this stage.31.    There is the further objection to the granting of assistanceto Zambia for the Railway debt, that any such undertaking would at once raise Southern Rhodesia&apos;s hopes of similar treatment.32.   We feel that the proper course for the Zambia Government isto make provision in the normal way by sinking funds,  which ought ,at any rate in the earlier years, to be well within their capacity.33.    In communicating to the Zambians that we feel unable to give them direct assistance with their public debt problem, we could say that,  if in the event they run into difficulties in financingtheir development &quot;programme owing to the burden of public debtliabilities, we should be willing to examine the position in thelight of all the circumstances at the time.L.      CONCLUSIONS34.    There is no economic case for aid to Zambia at present.    TheC.R.0.  consider that there is a strong political case for givingaid.    If the political case is judged to be overriding, we shall need to quantify this in terms of the amount of aid to be offeredand the period to which it should relate...   Two possibilitiesare suggested:-(a) ^^tjberm:    we could try to negotiate a settlementrelated&quot;to&quot; Zambia&apos;s Transitional Development Plan which runs until mid-1966.    In this case the C.R.0.  considerthat a total of  5 million should be offered (to includeup to  2 million for defence aid),  coupled with anundertaking to examine Zambia&apos;s development needs inthe light of her full Five Year Development Plan, 1966-70.(b) Lonff ,/term :    we could offer  10 million over 5 years&quot;(to include up to  2 million for defence aid), andwould expect to be discharged from any furtherobligation arising from Dissolution.8.CONFIDENTIAL

35.    The amount of aid offered under course (a) would he regardedas unattractively small by the Zambians,,    They would expect toreceive a further instalment in 1966,  and it is possible that over a five year period we might find ourselves giving more aidthan under course (b).    In the first 18 months, the question of-local costs might cause difficulty.    Course (b) involves a long-term commitment to a country which is already comparatively well placed financially:    this could be embarrassing if during the fiveyear period we had to cut down on aid to poorer countries.

EXTRACT FROM REPORT OF THE CENTRAL AFRICA CONFERENCE,  1963(&quot;Victoria Falls Resort&quot;)i!Tlie Chairman made it clear that Her Majesty&apos;s Government&apos; transaction in dissolving the Federation was based on their assessment of the political realities of the situation.    It was true thatthe acceptance of Federal liabilities would impose a burden onthe territories but many valuable and indeed essential assetswould also pass to the territories and it would surely be wrong to divorce the question of assets from that of liabilities.Broadly speaking, liabilities were the counterpart of benefits which accrued to the territories individually or collectively.Difficulties might well arise in certain cases but the rightapproach to the whole question was to start from the connection between assets and liabilities.    This approach would not pre-judgeconsideration at a later stage of the capacity of the territories to carry the burden and the position of the Federation&apos;s creditorsin the new circumstances.    The post-Conference machinery should start their work on the basis of seeing where in consequence ofthe re-allocation of functions the assets were physically likelyto lie,   and apportioning the liabilities,  including the public debt among the three successor governments in such a way as broadlyto correspond with the division of assets and to deal equitablywith any anomalies which might arise.    It was then that there would emerge the question whether any territory would be saddled with  -too heavy a debt burden,  since it would be seen exactly whatresponsibilities would fall to it.    At that stage it would be forconsideration between governments what means might be adopted tolighten the burden.    The question whether the United KingdomGovernment could and should help would have to be considered inthe light of their general policies on overseas aid towardscountries which showed need for assistance in the development oftheir- economies.    It would be in accordance with these policies for the United Kingdom Gove rnment to consider the need of a commonwealth territory, within the limits of their resources andthe calls upon them in the light of such territory&apos;s economic position as a whole - including of course its debt burden.&quot;

C0NR:y:-:wv&apos;v.\::Annexe BNorthern Rhodesia&apos;s Public Debt after DissolutionAccording to a memorandum received from the Government of northern rhodesia in May 1964 the total public debt of the territory after dissolutionamountea to nearly  107 m,       No analysis was provided, either then or later,and our own information about its constituent items is incomplete;   but themain ones are as listed in the attached table.2.     The total Federal Public Debt to be apportioned on Dissolution was 269 m.     Allocation of many of the items was comparatively easy where theywere identifiable with assets of the country, or assets jointly owned with southern Rhodesia or where they were clearly debts applicable only to northern Rhodesia.     Debts of this nature, which Northern Rhodesia accepted without question, are shown in column 1 of the table attached herewith.Certain of the debts relating to money on loaned far specific projects (e,g, theKariba Dam and some, but not all, railway loans) are self financing.     other of the railway loans are not self financing as monsy was loaned on&quot;softer&quot; terms than these on which it was borrowed.     The table also&apos;indicates such information of this nature as is available,3.     One element of the Federal Public Debt, however, was not  -apportioned to the satisfaction of Northern Rhodesia.       According to theZambia Governmenfs request for aid, submitted in January 1?65, there remained on dissolution a debt of  59      in respect of a federal loan accountfrom which expenditure on federal capital projects such as roads and buildingshad been financed.     Federal capital expenditure of this nature had in factamounted to  91 m. during the lifetime of the Federation ( 27-7 nu inNorthex^ Rhodesia,  55*6 raa in Southern Rhodesia and  7.6 m. in Nyasaland).It was therefore proposed that the  59 m. should be apportioned between the territories as the  91 m, had been spent.4.     Northern Rhodesia, however, contended that during Federation theterritory had&apos; contributed to Federal revenue  75 m, more than the value of thefederal services she had received, that the Federal Government had accordinglytransferred some  26 m. to the Federal Loan Account in question, therebyaccounting for most of the  32 m. expended on federal capital works over and/above

above the  59 m. in respect of which a debt remained outstanding onDissolution.     Northern Rhodesia protested against the consequentialallocation to her of  18.374 m. of the  59 m, debt, contending that suchan allocation was unjust as it had the effect of requiring her to pay forthe same assets tvri.ce.     She further expressed a desire to take the issue to arbitration.     The items disputed are shown in a special column in theattached table,5,     All the other governments however supported the proposed apportionment.H.M.G. represented to the Northern Rhodesian Government that it would be embarrassing to us for the matter to go to arbitration and in order to resolve the impasse caused by this and other difficulties gave an undertaking to consider with both Rhodesian Governments as soon as conveniently feasiblethe possibility of financial aid in the light of the burdens assumed by eachand.of our general aid policies.       The Northern Rhodesian Government thenreluctantly acquiesced in the apportionment to their account of the offending 18.374 m. though forthwith registering their views particularly emphasisingtheir reliance on the above quoted undertaking.     Although this undertakingis extremely cautiously worded and, as far as we are concerned means what itsays, it was in fact interpreted by the Northern Rhodesian Government as a promise to give relief on account of the burden of public debt with whichthey had been &quot;unjustly&quot; saddled.Public Debt Repayments6.     The effect of the foregoing Zambian Public Debt commitment, taking intoaccount all reimbursements which will become available (from sinking funds andon lending repayments) , is that accordingto the Zambia Government they will have toprovide the following ne* amounts for debt servicing and redemption from now untilmid 1971:-1964/58,088,0731965/610,5^7,0021966/76,019,6081967/86,832,4061968/94,196,1631969/706,181,9161970/712,942,805/The Railway

7.     There is a further factor affecting Zambia^ publio debt liability.She shared with Southern Rhodesia responsibility for some  22,25m. of federal government debt on-lent to the railways for one-hundred years repayable tostockholders in 1 970/72.     This was apparently largely internally raised and Zambia makes no complaint about the allocation of this debt or aboutservicing or repayment difficulties.     In addition however some  20m. of loans raised by Southern Rhodesia and Northern Rhodesia before federationlargely on the London market are also due for repayment as to  14,5m. in1 970/71,  7.730m, in 1 971/72 and something under  2m. in 1 973.     Theliability is equally shared by Zamoia and Southern Rhodesia although the1 310 loan was raised by Seuthern Rhodesia and the other two by northern rhodesia in whose names respectively the loans still stand.8.     Zambia (and Southern Rhodesia) can meet these liabilities only bylomestio savings or further borrowing.     The possibility *f either countrybeing able to raise money on the London market between now and 1 972 is veryslight,     Zambia is too nev; to have acquired any standing and the uncertainty surrounding Seuthern Rhodesia affects both countries.     not even a very large ca.-sh bonus offered to existing stockholders who agreed to convert their holdings into loans of longer maturity and a higher interestrate will be l&amp;kely to improve the market prospects today, although suoh. acourse was proposed by Southern Rhodesia in 1 963 and considered viable atthat &amp;aX,e.9.      Zambia has asked in her present application that H.M.&amp;. will beoome&quot;&quot;lender of last resort&quot; in respect of the pre Federal railway debt repay-ment liabilities whioh will cost her  1 0m. in the period 1 970/72.Participation by us in Zambia&apos;s public debt problem should however be excluded on the following grounds:-(a)   Such action could not be limited to Zambia but would have to beextended to Southern Rhodesia and in all probability to EACS0which also has a rail debt maturing in 1 972,00It would reflect on the creditworthiness of the territory.It would involve discrimination in favour of particular groups of stockholders.

10,   H.M.G-. could not give any undertaking to give financial support in circumstances which cannot at present be foreseen, either as to our ownbalance of payments or more especially the situation in the countries at thatdate.     Moreover any assurance given now would inhibit the territories fromconsidering steps which they could themselves take.11,   In these conditions the proper course is for Zambia and SouthernRhodesia to make their own provisions by special sinking funds or reserves,to redeem the debts.     It is confidentially believed that Southern Rhodesiais already doing this.    We should encourage Zambia to ensure that the  :steps she is taking will be auequate.     For example although  1.5m. is set aside in the 1964/65 budget for the supplementary sinking fund (paragraph 35and table DIl) no provision is made in subsequent years.
