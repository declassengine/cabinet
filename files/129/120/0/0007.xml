THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1965C. (65) 7 Copy No. 5 919th January, 1965CABINETTRADE DISPUTES BILL: QUESTION OF RETROSPECTIONMemorandum by Minister of labour I was invited by the Cabinet (C.C. (64) 16th Conclusions,Minute No. 3) to consider, in consultation with the Lord chancellor and the Attorney-General, the degree of retrospection for which provision should be made in the proposed Trade Disputes Bill andthe extent to which, as a result, the Bill might be a hybrid measure.2. The problem is how the Bill should deal with causes ofaction arising before it becomes law. Unless the Bill is explicit onthis point, all legal proceedings which depend upon such causes ofaction will be settled in accordance with the law as it is now. such proceedings may be started up to six years after a cause of actionaccrues and the situation could therefore arise in which an action is settled under the present law many years after the Bill comes intooperation. This would be unsatisfactory and I think that the Billshould have some measure of retrospective effect.3. The maximum degree of retrospection would be to makethe Bill apply to all proceedings which are in train when it comes into operation. This seems objectionable because it means that persons who had started litigation before the Bill was published andits contents known (though we have declared our general intention),might find their cause of action removed or drastically altered beforethe action was settled. This objection would not apply if the bill were to cover proceedings started after it has been published becausesuch proceedings will be started in the knowledge, at least, that thelaw might be changed before they are completed. Nevertheless, itis not entirely satisfactory that it should be a matter of chance underwhich dispensation an action is finally settled.4. My view is that the Bill should apply to proceedings startedafter it becomes law. It will then be clear at the time proceedingsstart whether they will be settled under the old law or the new law.I think that this degree of retrospection is unlikely to be strongly criticised and will not cause unnecessary difficulties in Parliament.As regards the practical effects the issue will be a marginal one.There may be two or three cases in the next few months but it is unlikely that there will be more.5302
5. The Bill will not be a hybrid measure whether it applies to proceedings started after publication or after it becomes law.6. I recommend that it should apply to proceedings startedafter it becomes law. The Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-Generalagree with this.R. J. G.Ministry of Labour,18th January, 1965.
