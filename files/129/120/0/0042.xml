THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1965C. (65) 42 Copy No.        515th March, 1965CABINETSTEEL NATIONALISATIONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of power at their meeting on 22nd October, 1964 (CC. (64) 2nd Meeting,Item 3), the Cabinet took note that the Prime Minister would make arrangements for the preparation of a measure to nationalise theiron and steel industry. By direction of the Prime Minister, a ministerial Committee on Iron and Steel Nationalisation was subsequently constituted under the Chancellor of the Exchequer.This Committee has worked out proposals for the nationalisationmeasure and a summary of the main features of these is at Annex I.Compensation is being dealt with separately.2. The proposals follow the general lines of those in C. (64) 5considered by the Cabinet on 22nd October last, except that they donot cover the British Iron and Steel Federation (B.I.S.F.) and itstrading subsidiaries. The Committee&apos;s objectives have been to draw up proposals which would:(a) Allow us to keep the Nationalisation Bill relatively short and simple and to avoid hybridity.(b) Enable the National Steel Corporation to secure effective and speedy control of the main part of the industrywithout a difficult transition and without having to diverteffort to the acquisition and direction of a large numberof small companies outside the main core of the industry.3.  We invite attention to the following points:(a) ScopeNationalisation will embrace the 13 major groups(including Richard Thomas and Baldwins) which dominatethe industry and own all 22 integrated steelworks in theUnited Kingdom. The nationalised sector will account for over 90 per cent of production of iron ore, pig iron,crude carbon steel, heavy products, sheet and tinplate,and will occupy a strong position in the other mainproducts. An extension of nationalisation beyond the 13major groups would cause disproportionate difficultieswithout significantly strengthening the position of theSECRET5507 A\
nationalised sector. Necessary rationalisation of theremaining private sector should be brought about bycompetition among the private firms and between themand the nationalised sector, and by the expansion of the nationalised sector on a normal comercial basis.\b) Engineering groupsThe Chairman of G.K.N., Tube Investments andVickers have proposed that their iron and steel interests,other than Tube Investments&apos; Park Gate company,should be exempted from nationalisation. The ministerial committee rejected this proposal. The exclusion ofthese major units, which sell substantial quantities ofsteel on the open market, would prejudice rationalisationand orderly development of the main part of theindustry and would weaken substantially the position ofthe nationalised sector in the alloy steels which are becoming increasingly important. These considerationsoutweigh the disadvantages which these Groups mayexperience by the breaking up of the intimate association between their steel and engineering interests: and wewould take steps to ensure that the National steel corporation gives attention to the special requirementsof these engineering concerns.(c) DiversificationThe National Steel Corporation will have wide powers to diversify its activities. As a result of nationalisation by the transfer of shares, it will acquireall the diversified interests of the main steel companiesas a base for further diversification. To retain animportant element in this base, the ministerial committee propose the rejection of requests fromDorman Long and Lancashire Steel that nationalisationshould be confined to their steel companies. There may,however, be a case for allowing these groups to hiveoff one or two of their bridge-building or general engineering subsidiaries which are remote from the steelindustry. This case can be considered on merits if it is put forward.(d) OrganisationInitially, the company organisation will be preservedand this should ease transitional problems. the nationalisation measure, however, will leave open thelong-term organisation of the nationalised sector but willrequire the National Steel Corporation to submit proposals about this to the Minister within 12 months ofVesting Day. We are sure that this is the only practicablecourse and that we should not be diverted from it by avain search for a form of organisation which would renderdenationalisation impossible. The safeguard againstdenationalisation lies not in statutory provisions, which
can be reversed, but in the fact that the main part of the steel industry now consists of very large units and it isvery doubtful whether another denationalisation effortcould be mounted, in view of the amounts of moneyinvolved and the experience on the last occasion.The British Iron and Steel Federation4. The Cabinet were told in C. (64) 5 that the B.I.S.F. set-upwas extremely complicated. It has, in fact, proved even more complicated than we had feared and appears to have been deliberatelydesigned to make unravelling difficult. (Annex II describes theorganisation of the B.I.S.F. and its trading subsidiaries.) We clearlycannot tolerate any longer than we must a situation in which the nationalised companies continue as members of the B.I.S.F., and b.I.S.F. trading companies control the import of essential rawmaterials required as to more than 90 per cent for the nationalised industry. A satisfactory solution would, however, almost certainly involve a hybrid Bill and at present we lack the information on which to frame such a measure with confidence. At the request of the ministerial Committee, the Law Officers are examining this matterurgently and are submitting a separate report to Cabinet. Subjectto any suggestions they may be able to make, we are, however, facedwith a choice between deferring the introduction of the Bill, probablyuntil next session, with no certainty that we could frame satisfactoryprovisions even at the cost of hybridity, or leaving the readjustmentof functions between the B.I.S.F. and the Corporation to be dealtwith in the first place by negotiation. If we choose the latter alternative,we could strengthen the negotiating position of the Corporation by making it clear during the parliamentary passage of the nationalisation Bill that, if a satisfactory settlement is not agreed, we will introduce further legislation. This further legislation, which would almost certainly be hybrid, could be firmly based on informationacquired by the Corporation through their ownership of the nationalised companies.The Bill5. Drafting of the Bill has made good progress on the basis ofthe decisions of the Ministerial Committee. Parliamentary Counselis, wherever possible, reviving provisions of the Iron and Steel Act,1949. This should enable him to keep the Bill to about 40 pagescompared with 97 pages of the 1949 Act. A formula has been devised to include the companies mentioned in paragraph 3 (a) and to avoidhybridity. The House authorities are satisfied about this but a rulingwill be sought from the Speaker before the Bill is submitted to legislation Committee.conclusions. These proposals provide a basis for proceeding quickly withthe nationalisation of the main part of the steel industry and werecommend to the Cabinet the general shape of the proposals as explained above, subject to the question of the British Iron and SteelSECRET5507 A 2
Federation. This last question will need to be considered by Cabinetin the light of such suggestions as the Law Officers can make(paragraph 4 above) and in relation to the question of timing andtactics. The alternatives before us seem to be to:(i) Proceed with the introduction of the Bill in its present shape,probably this month, and leave the problem of the B.I.S.F.to be dealt with on the lines indicated at the end ofparagraph 4, recognising that this may mean a second Bill.(ii) Defer the introduction of the Bill in an attempt to deal withthe B.I.S.F. question in the knowledge that this will almost certainly involve hybridity with consequentdifficulty and delay in the passage of the Bill.L.

Annex I summary OF PROPOSALS OF MINISTERIAL COMMITTEEON IRON AND STEEL NATIONALISATIONScope and method of nationalisation1. Nationalisation should be effected by the transfer to aNational Steel Corporation of all the shares and securities ofRichard Thomas and Baldwins, the holding companies of theDorman Long and Lancashire Steel groups, the other seven majorprivate steel companiesO) and the iron and steel subsidiaries ofGuest, Keen and Nettlefolds, Tube Investments and Vickers.(2)Vesting Day should be nine months after the Royal Assent to the nationalisation measure or such earlier date as the Minister of Powermay fix by an order not subject to Parliamentary procedure.Organisation of the nationalised sector2. The Corporation should consist of a chairman and from 10to 16 other members appointed by the Minister of Power. TheCorporation^ relationship to the Minister would be broadly similarto that between parent Ministers and the Boards which direct theother main nationalised industries. The Corporation^ relationship to its subordinate units would initially be that of a holding companybut, as sole shareholder, it would be in a position either to undertakesubstantial regrouping of the assets of its subsidiaries while retaininga company structure or to draw in the assets of its subsidiaries to itself and establish a unitary organisation like that of the national coal Board. The nationalisation measure should not lay down thesubstructure of organisation below the Corporation; but it should require the Corporation to submit a report on organisation to theMinister within 12 months of Vesting Day (or a longer periodallowed by the Minister) and should empower the Minister to givethe Corporation specific directions on organisation.Powers and duties of National Steel corporation . The Corporation should have the power to carry on ironand steel activities and any other activities which the nationalisedcompanies are empowered to carry on by their memoranda of association. Diversification outside the iron and steel field shouldbe subject to the Ministers consent. The Corporation should also have (i) a power, subject to the Ministers approval, to purchaseland compulsorily and (ii) a power to obtain information from thecentral trade associations and trading companies of the industry.4. The main duties of the Corporation specified in the nationalisation measure should be to promote the efficient andeconomic supply of iron and steel products; to avoid undue(&apos;) Colvilles Ltd.; Consett Iron Co. Ltd.; John Summers &amp; Sons Ltd.; SouthDurham Steel and Iron Co. Ltd.; Steel Company of Wales Ltd.; Stewarts andLloyds Ltd.; United Steel Companies Ltd.(2) G.K.N. Steel Co. Ltd.; Park Gate Iron and Steel Co. Ltd. and Round OakSteel Works Ltd.; English Steel Corporation Ltd.
discrimination between customers; to promote the safety, health and welfare of employees and to set up machinery for negotiation and joint consultation; to promote exports and to promote research and development.The Iron and Steel Board and the private sector5. The Iron and Steel Board should be dissolved. Specialstatutory controls over the private sector should in general be abolished, but the Minister should have a reserve power to controlmajor development projects in the basic fields of iron and steel-making. Relations between the nationalised and private sectors shouldbe allowed to develop on a non-statutory basis. There should bea &quot; little Neddy&quot; or similar arrangement to provide for the participation of the whole industry in national economic planning.Advisory bodies6. (a) The nationalisation measure should provide for theestablishment of a Consumer Council appointed by the Minister.(b) The Minister should set up a non-statutory advisory councilon research and development covering both the nationalised and private sectors.Other points7. (a) Imports. There should be no special provisions for the regulation of iron and steel imports. Such provisions would be contrary to the EFTA Convention and would give rise to difficultiesunder the GATT. There would be a danger of retaliation against oursteel exports, the value of which is several times the value of oursteel imports.(b) Iron ore in the ground. It is not proposed to nationaliseiron ore in the ground. An attempt to do this would involve extremelycomplicated provisions. The Bill for the Coal Act, 1938, whichnationalised all coal in the ground, took about three years to prepare,ran to 97 pages and had to be preceded by the Coal (registration of Ownership) Act, 1937. The omission of provisions to nationaliseiron ore in the ground is not of practical importance. The companies to be nationalised account for 95 per cent of the United kingdom production of iron ore and control 60 per cent of proved workablereserves. Most of the practical results to be gained from nationalisingiron ore rights can be achieved through the Corporation^ power topurchase land compulsorily which could be used against owners of either surface or mining rights.4th March, 1965.
Annex IITHE B.I.S.F. AND ITS TRADING SUBSIDIARIESThe Organisation of the B.I.S.F.1. The British Iron and Steel Federation (B.I.S.F.) is the centraltrade association of the steel industry. It is not a legal entity, beingregistered neither as a company nor a friendly society. It is composedof 10 &quot; conferences &quot; representing sections of the industry on aproduct basis. Some of the conferences are composed of associationsrepresenting smaller sections. The steel-producing companies belong to the appropriate conferences or associations and not directly tothe B.I.S.F. A company producing a wide range of products willbelong to several conferences. The B.I.S.F. has not felt able to providethe Ministry with details of the constitutions of the conferences andlocal associations.2. The governing body of the B.I.S.F. is its Council whichconsists of some 50 members elected by the conferences and fourco-opted members. The centre of power, however, is the ExecutiveCommittee composed of about 30 members appointed by the Councilon a personal, not a representative, basis. In practice, the ExecutiveCommittee consists of the leading steel masters. Of 59 Councilmembers for 1965, 16 come from companies which will remain in private ownership and 2 from companies in which there will be a50 per cent private interest. Of 32 Executive Committee members,7 come from companies which will remain in private ownership andone from a company in which there will be a 50 per cent privateinterest.3. The constitution of the B.I.S.F. can be amended and theB.I.S.F. can be dissolved by a special resolution of the Councilrequiring a three-quarters majority of those present and voting. Onthe basis of the 1965 composition of the Council, the nationalisedsector would fall just short of controlling a three-quarters majority.In the event of dissolution by a special resolution, the surplus funds and property would be distributed among conferences in proportion to the respective values of their outputs and any deficit would bemade good by a levy in the same proportions. On the other hand, aconference which withdraws voluntarily from the B.I.S.F. is not entitled to any share of the assets of the B.I.S.F.04. The B.I.S.F. performs the normal tasks of a trade association(representing the views of the industry to the Government,international organisations, other industries, etc.) but it also providescertain central services including imported iron-ore supplies. they include a central statistical service, operated in collaboration withthe Iron and Steel Board; central arrangements for reviewing the short and long-term outlook for steel and the proposals of the(&apos;) The assets of the B.I.S.F. appear to consist of its directly-owned assetsplus the assets of the British Iron and Steel Corporation Ltd., other than thoseheld on Industry Fund account (see paragraph 11 below).
companies for major capital expenditure; central trainingarrangements and the making of grants to the British Iron andSteel Research Association.Trading subsidiaries5. The central services cover certain trading operations carriedout for the industry as a whole through the British Iron and steel corporation Ltd. (B.I.S.C.) and its subsidiaries. B.I.S.C. Ltd. is a holding company, all the shares of which are held for the B.I.S.F.through nominees. It carries on some operations itself (though thesedirect operations are now on a small scale only) and controls theoperations of its subsidiaries, which are described in paragraph 6.These trading operations are closely bound up with the IndustryFund, which is described in paragraphs 7-11.6.   The subsidiaries of B.I.S.C. are:(a) B.I.S.C. (Ore) Ltd. (wholly owned) which is responsible forthe central import of iron and manganese ore and itsresale in the United Kingdom. B.I.S.C. (Ore) Ltd., acting as agents for B.I.S.C. Ltd. under an agreement which canbe terminated at three months&apos; notice on either side, hasentered into long-term contracts for the purchase of overseas ore and long-term charters for the use of ore-carrying ships. The main United Kingdom users of foreignore have given undertakings, subject to 12 months&apos; notice on either side, to obtain all their requirements of importedore from B.I.S.C. (Ore) Ltd. There are seven companies which have signed these undertakings which are not onthe list for nationalisation. We have no figures of theextent of B.I.S.C. (Ore) Ltd.&apos;s operations on behalf ofthese companies, but their total production of iron in1963-64 was less than 700,000 tons and one of them is a fairly substantial producer of home ore. These figuresmay be compared with B.I.S.C. (Ore) imports of 14 million tons of ore in 1963 and the total United kingdom production of iron of 16,100,000 tons in 1963-64.(b) B.I.S.C. (Salvage) Ltd. (wholly owned) which is responsiblefor the purchase of scrap, mainly from ship-breaking,which is only available at a price above that agreed forscrap generally between the B.I.S.F. and the NationalFederation of Scrap Iron, Steel and Metal Merchants. Theactivities of this subsidiary are being run down, but at theend of 1963 it held stocks of scrap worth about 14- million and owed its parent company  1-6 million.(c) British Steel Corporation Ltd. (wholly owned) owns theindustry&apos;s investments in six ore shipping companies witha total fleet of 28 ships and the 20 per cent central interestin British Ore Investment Corporation Ltd. which investsin overseas ore fields. The remaining 80 per cent interest
in this concern is held by nine of the thirteen majorgroups.0(d) British Magnesite Corporation Ltd. B.I.S.C. owns shares tothe nominal value of  600 out of a total share capital of 1,000. The largest outside interest is that of Steetley&apos;s,the producers of refractory materials. The Corporation is responsible for the central import of magnesite andmagnesite bricks for use as furnace lining.The Industry Fund7. The &quot; Industry Fund &quot; is a fund created to finance the centralactivities of the industry in respect of training and research, and alsoto provide the financial backing for B.I.S.C.&apos;s trading operations. TheFund has no constitution as such, and is defined solely by the termsof separate but identical agreements entered into between individualsteel producers and B.I.S.C. The current agreement &quot; terminates &quot;,in the sense described in paragraph 10(6) below, on 31st March,1965, and a new but substantially similar one is being negotiated forthe three years to 31st March, 1968. The agreement provides forcertain points to be settled by Producers&apos; Meetings, composed ofrepresentatives of the steel producers who are party to the agreement.Decisions at Producers&apos; Meetings have to be approved both by 80 percent of the producers represented and by producers who produce80 per cent of total crude steel production by members.8. There are currently 33 producer signatories to the agreement,responsible for all the country&apos;s crude steel production, apart from asmall tonnage of high-speed steels. Of the 33 signatories to theIndustry Fund Agreement, 24 are companies, or subsidiaries of companies, which are to be nationalised. The Corporation would thuscontrol the votes of producers accounting for 80 per cent of crudesteel production but not the votes of 80 per cent of producers entitledto be represented at Producers&apos; Meetings. It would be able to blockresolutions it did not favour but not to force through resolutionsopposed by the private companies.9. Under the Industry Fund Agreement, steel producers paylevies to B.I.S.C. based on their steel production (the ingot levy) andon their usage of bought-in scrap (the scrap levy). The levies arereflected in the prices charged by the producers for their steel, and are thus ultimately borne by the consumer. The scrap levy, which in 1962and 1963 produced about  12 million a year, is used to finance a self-balancing scheme known as the scrap levy/pig iron remissionscheme which is designed to encourage development of iron-making capacity and to offset the advantage to scrap users of the artificiallylow prices maintained for United Kingdom scrap. The ingot levy,which in 1962 and 1963 produced about  2 million a year, is used tocover the following classes of expenditure:(a) Routine Central Expenditure. This includes the administra-tive expenses of Industry Fund operations; expenditure(l) Colvilles, Consett, Dorman Long, G.K.N. Steel, John Summers, SouthDurham, Steel Company of Wales, Richard Thomas and Baldwins, United Steel.SECRET5507 BS
on research (mainly contributions to the British Iron andSteel Research Association) totalling  870,000 in 1963;and expenditure on training totalling  140,000 in 1963.(b) The Raw Materials Supplies Development Fund.   This is used to repay the short-term borrowing by which theBritish Steel Corporation Ltd. finances its investments inore shipping companies and overseas ore fields. Theannual amounts set aside to the Fund are calculated at separately which will repay each individual investment over aperiod of 10 years.(c) Imports of iron and manganese ore.   Up to 1958, substantiallosses were incurred on the importation of iron andmanganese ore, and these were paid for out of theIndustry Fund. From 1958 to 1.963, operations were carried out on the principle that they should involveneither a profit nor a loss in total, though there wascross-subsidisation in favour of the importers who had totake ores from more distant sources. Since 1st January,1964, most ores have been sold at cost, but there is asurcharge to cover losses arising from past shippingcharters, and to cover continuing subsidies on a few ores.In addition, under its agency agreement with B.I.S.C.(Ore) Ltd. (paragraph 6 (a) above), B.I.S.C. is liable tomeet any financial deficiencies arising on B.I.S.C. (Ore)Ltd.&apos;s operations and to repay all that company&apos;s costs and administrative expenses. Such costs are met byB.I.S.C. out of the Industry Fund.(d) Losses on other trading operations.   Until the late 1950s,the Industry Fund carried heavy losses on the import of pig iron, scrap and semi-finished steel, so as to spreadtheir costs over the industry and thus over consumers asa whole. Loss-spreading operations through the IndustryFund have now been restricted to operations in high-costscrap, which are now also being discontinued. As a result,expenditure under this heading fell from  60 million inthe year ending March 1953 to  0-1 million in the calendar year 1963.10. The following further points about the Industry FundAgreement are important:(a) The level of the levies is determined by the ExecutiveCommittee of the B.I.S.F.(b) The new agreement, like the old, is drawn on the assumptionthat no new commitments will be entered into after a set date (31st March, 1968, in the new agreement) unless a Producers&apos; Meeting decides on the proposal of theExecutive Committee of the B.I.S.F. to prolong theagreement. The Corporation would be in a position to block a resolution to prolong the agreement. Even if theagreement is not prolonged, producers&apos; obligations tomeet possible deficits arising continue until all the
SECRET11liabilities of the Fund have been discharged. In view ofthe long period for which some shipping charters havebeen entered into, some of these liabilities might not be discharged for 10 years or more.(c) Producers can only be released from their obligations underthe agreement by a decision of the other producers whoare parties to it. Such a decision requires the double80 per cent majority (see paragraph 7 above).(d) Producers are bound to require any purchaser of theirsteelworks to observe the terms of the agreement. this obligation would continue to rest on the nationalisedcompanies.(e) If the agreement is terminated, any assets remaining after all the liabilities have been discharged are to be dividedamong the producers &quot; in such fair and reasonableproportions as the Executive Committee of the B.I.S.F.may decide &quot;.11. The relationship between B.I.S.C. and the Industry fund is difficult to define, but B.I.S.C. regards certain of its assets and liabilities as being held or incurred by it on Industry Fund account.Among the assets so held are the Shares of the British steel corporation (and, hence, B.S.C.&apos;s investments in shipping companies and overseas ore fields) and the loans made to B.I.S.C. (Ore) and b.I.S.C. (Salvage) to enable those companies to carry on theircentral trading operations. While B.I.S.C. owns these assets as a principal, it owns them subject to the Industry Fund Agreement;the assets do not therefore contribute to the net value of B.I.S.C.to its shareholders, i.e., the B.I.S.F. The net book value of the assets of the Industry Fund at the end of 1963 were, according to itsbalance sheet,  5-1 million against a total net book value for B.I.S.C.and its subsidiaries as a whole, including Industry Fund assets, of 6-3 million; but the latter included  0-7 million reserves of B.S.C.(Ltd.) which related to the Industry Fund but were not shown inthe Industry Fund Balance Sheet. Not all the remainder of B.I.S.C.&apos;sassets are the property of B.I.S.C.&apos;s shareholders since a part ofthem relates to the British Steel Exporters&apos; Association and other minor funds.Other financial arrangements12. The general administrative expenses of the B.I.S.F.,including publicity and propaganda expenditure, are covered bylevies on the conferences in proportions fixed by the ExecutiveCommittee or, in default of a decision, related to the value of their output. If a conference defaults on its obligations to pay levies, the member companies become liable.
