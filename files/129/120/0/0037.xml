Cabinet Office,London, S.W.1 .26th February, 1965Review Body on doctors and Dentists&apos; RemunerationWe have been asked to state our intentisns with respect to theeffect of our Fifth Report, in the event of the medical profession being unable to agree to the schemes for direct reimbursement of certain praftti&amp;eexpenses,2.     In that Report we recommended inter alia thatj(l)   in 1965-66 and subsequent years payments to general medical practitioners by hospital authorities, local authorities and government departments should be excluded from the pool andaverage net income for purposes of the pool calculation shouldrelate to all the services for which payments are made to general practitioners by Executive Councils;(2)   from 1 B&apos;b April 1965 the average net income for Executive Councilservices credited to the pool for every principal under theage of seventy providing unrestricted general medical services should be  2,775;(3)   the additional money which these recommendations would make available in the pool should be drawn upon so far as necessary tomake possible the introduction of schemes for the partial directreimbursement to individual doctors of expenditure on ancillaryhelp and on practice premises.3.    When we took the evidence on which our Fifth Report was based, wewere informed that:a scheme had been agreed in principle between the Health department and the profession&apos;s representatives for reimbursement direct to individual doctors of about two-thirds of their expenditure onancillary help, anda fairer distribution of total reimbursements of expenditure onpractice premises was agreed to be desirable and consideration wasbeing given to a scheme for contributing direct to the expenses of individual doctors who incurred relatively heavy costs on practicepremises.The Rt. Hon. Harold Wilson, O.B.E., M.P.,10, Downing Street,S.W.1. &apos; -1-     NCONFIDENTIAL

4.     The third of the recommendations set out in paragraph 2 was madeon the assumption - indeed in the hope - that schemes would be agreed bythe profession for introduction en 1st April 196&quot;5.     If the schemes werenot introduced, that recommendation could not take effect.     All the other recommendations contained in our Fifth Report would stand.5.     We should, however, deplore it if the schemes for partial directreimbursement were not introduced.     We consider that these schemes would encourage doctors to employ more ancillary staff and would help those whouse good practice premises, by adding to the gross remuneration of thosewho do so.     Thus the schemes would be in the best interest of the prefessionand of patients.     We see no practicable method, other than the one we proposed, of introducing these schemes without either overdrawing the poolor asking doctors to forgo the final distribution of earlier pool balanoesand committing future pools or reducing capitation fees.(Signed) KENDERSLEY-2-S
