S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENTSITUATION IN GENERAL, PRACTICEMemorandum by the Minister of health on 24th March, 1965, a Conference of Doctors&apos; representatives will decide whether the undated resignations which have been sent in tothe British Medical Guild (according to the British Medical Associationby upwards of 60 per cent of general practitioners) should be sent in totake effect on 1st July.    Unless the Conference takes a specific decision that the resignations should be v/ithheld, they will be sent in.      Thedecision will turn in large part on the terms of the letter which I shallbe sending to the profession with comments on their &quot;Family DoctorsCharter&quot; and I should like to have my colleagues approval to the contents of this letter.    A draft is annexed.2.      The call for resignations was provoked by the recent report ondoctors&apos; pay by the Review Body on doctors ana Dentists&apos; Remuneration.The profession also called for immediate discussions with theGovernment on a new contract and new methods of remuneration and asan essential preliminary to these negotiations they stipulated that the 5^ million pay increase recommended by the Review Body (which they regarded as totally inadequate) should be added unconditionally to the pool of doctors&apos; remuneration.3.      The Review Body&apos;s clarification of their report left us no option but to do as the profession wished in regard to the S.5j million(C. C..(65) 13th Conclusions, Minute 1).    The profession then submitted on 8th March their &quot;Charter&quot; for family doctor services, and I havehad a series of meetings with their representatives about it.    The Chartemakes a number of suggestions of which advantage can be taken tosecure a whole range of much needed improvements in general practice,and I have told the profession that it seems to me to provide a frame-work for negotiation on the terms of the doctor&apos;s contract and methodsof remuneration.    But it also contains specific proposals for a very bigincrease in the amount of remuneration and the method of assessing this and the demand that these matters should be negotiated direct with theGovernment and not referred to the Review Body.    This part of the charter is clearly quite unacceptable, but I saw some prospect of achieving a reasonable settlement by concentrating on the matters onwhich agreement seemed likely and going as far as possible, even atthis early stage, in responding positively on these matters.    Thiswas in the belief that the leaders of the profession would then find themselves able to advise the rank and file not to resign, even though their proposals on amount of remuneration had not been accepted.    in only one of these matters would it have been necessary to enter into a firm financial commitment at this stage.    I followed this course because it was my view that, if the meeting on 24th March did not result in the submission of resignation, the doctors&apos; position would becomeprogressively weaker.C.(65) 43COPY NO. 5 915th March, 1965CABINET1-

4.Discussion with those of my colleagues chiefly concerned,however, has revealed that not all of them see the matter in this light.They would wish me to be less forthcoming at this stage, beforenegotiations begin, and the annexed draft is therefore briefer and lessspecific than I should have wished.    I am far from confident that theterms of this letter are such as to fortify the leaders of the professionsufficiently to advise the Conference on 24th March against resignation,or indeed to enable them to carry the day with the rank and file ofthe profession even if they did.    I have made it clear that, if massresignations are submitted by the British Medical Guild, I cannot continue to negotiate.    If the resignations became effective, it wouldnot, of course, be possible to continue to provide a comprehensivegeneral medical service under the National Health Service.K. R.Ministry of Health, 3.E.I.15th March, 1965

annex draft Letter from the Minister of Health to theChairman of the General Practitioners1 Negotiating committee we have agreed that the  5-1 million increase in remunerationrecommended by the Review Body should be added unconditionally to the pool for 1965-66 and in accordance with your wishes it is to be distributed by increasing the capitation fee (at present 20s. 6d. ) and thetemporary resident fee (at present 21s. ) to 22s. 6d.    I am now writing,on behalf of the Secretary of State for Scotland and myself, in the lightof our discussions in the last few days, to put on record my preliminarygeneral reactions to the very far-reaching proposals in the &quot;FamilyDoctors&apos; Charter&quot; which you presented to me only on 8th March.It has been repeatedly stated that what is now needed in general practice more than anything else is a revision of general practitioners1terms of service and methods of remuneration.    I have told you that your proposals for a new type of contract and flexibility in methods of remuneration seem to me to provide a perfectly possible framework for negotiation.    During the course of negotiation I shall want to injectideas of my own, but I believe that the Charter offers an opportunity,which we should all do well to seize, to improve the general practitionerservice for doctor and patient alike.I was at first concerned lest the proposal for limited liability forthe individual doctor and a review of the Allocation Scheme implied arepudiation of the liability of the profession as a whole for the general medical care of the population as a wholee with continuous cover, but you have assured me that this is not so, subject to reasonable protectionof the individual doctor against unreasonable demands on his services.On this basis I am prepared to discuss limitation of individual liability.Perhaps I should deal first with the question of remuneration for services rendered under the new contract.    I am prepared in principle to envisage alternative methods of remuneration according to circumstances, provided that suitable safeguards can be devised.    Asto the amount to be paid, by whatever method is applicable, we have anindependent Review Body to advise on remuneration, and while I amcontent that the Government should discuss methods of remunerationdirect with the profession, I am sure that we must continue to look tothe Review Body for advice on levels of remuneration.     The Review-3-confidential

Body was set up because the Royal Commission which reported in I960thought it &quot;highly desirable in the interests of efficiency, good relations and mutual confidence to introduce some new machinery in place of direct negotiations for dealing with important financial changes&quot;, anda change on the introduction of a new form of contract is certainlyimportant.    I have suggested that the negotiation of the new contractwill produce an entirely new situation for the Review Body to consider.In considering this situation, it will be open to the Review 3ody to take account of any method or combination of methods of assessing levels of remuneration which is put before them by the profession.    We have so far been unable to reach a conclusion between us on how this matterof pricing a new contract should be handled.Leaving this one matter aside, I think we can perfectly wellnegotiate on the matters covered by the Charter and I believe that itwould be in everyone1 s interest that we should do so.One of the suggestions in the Charter, for example, is that public finance should be made available for the provision of practicepremises.    I am interested in any idea likely to improve general practice and I should be very ready to consider with the profession howpremises for practice can be provided in a manner most likely to bringmaximum benefit to doctors and patients alike.    I accept the need tohelp doctors with the provision of finance for practice premises, and Iam prepared to discuss with you your particular suggestion for aseparate publicly financed corporation, though, as I have explained toyou, this would require legislation.I entirely agree of course that family doctors should have access to proper diagnostic services and to hospital beds where appropriate, also that they should be able to work in concert withsocial and preventive services.    I see all this as part of the develop-ment of general practice along lines that accord best with local needs.For the rest also I think the Charter provides a framework for negotiation, for example on direct reimbursement of expenses onancillary help and rent of premises, measures to try to bring about a significant reduction in certification, and revision on the Terms ofService and the disciplinary machinery.-4-

To sum up:  I hope we can reach agreement on a new type of contract and new methods of remuneration; we are ready to proceedwith discussions on the provision of practice premises, and on theother matters covered by the Charter apart from the pricing of thenew contract; and the negotiation of a new type of contract must precedeits pricing.    I have therefore suggested that we should now get down to detailed discussions on these matters.These discussions are bound to take time, notwithstandingeveryone&apos;s best endeavours, and I do not see how new arrangements can be brought into effect before 1st April, 1966.     With good will on both sides I should hope we could have a new and priced contractready to introduce then.    Our joint aim must be to secure for thegeneral practitioner the conditions he requires to give the best care tohis patients and the greatest satisfaction to himself.-5-CONRDENT8AL
