THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1965C. (65) 23 Copy No.   5 917th February, 1965CABINETRACIAL DISCRIMINATION AND INCITEMENT TORACIAL HATREDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome DepartmentIt was stated in The Queen&apos;s Speech on the opening ofParliament that the Government would &quot; take action against racial discrimination and promote full integration into the community of immigrants who have come here from the Commonwealth &quot;. Duringthe Committee Stage of the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill Iindicated that it was our firm intention to introduce as soon aspossible legislation dealing with discrimination against colouredpersons in public places; and that if, as I hoped, we could overcome the formidable difficulties of definition, we would couple with itlegislation against incitement. (Official Report, 17th November, 1964,cols. 287-8.)2. I have since given much thought to the form which legislation might take and, following discussions with the LordChancellor and the Law Officers, I submitted a memorandum to theHome Affairs Committee. At their meeting on 12th February theCommittee expressed general agreement with my proposals, but inview of their political importance and inevitably controversial naturethey invited ;me to bring them before the Cabinet. This I now do.Racial discrimination3. If we are to make discrimination a criminal offence we must,I think, define fairly narrowly the area in which that offence may be committed and avoid interference with the rights of the individualwhere their exercise is not contrary to the public interest. We must also be sure that any provision creating an offence of discriminationcan be enforced. These are difficult problems.4. My proposal is that discrimination on grounds of race orcolour should be penalised if it is practised in places to which thepublic have access in particular in hotels, restaurants, public houses,places of entertainment or recreation and public transport vehicles.There is not much evidence of discrimination in such places now;but it is indefensible if it should occur and I think it is right to prohibit it. We cannot, I feel, go further and deal (for example)CONFIDENTIAL5394 a
with the refusal of landladies to take coloured lodgers which leads to a lot of complaint without interfering unjustifiably with the rightsof the individual.5. We must recognise that even in places to which the public have access, services may be refused to a coloured person for reasons which have nothing to do with discrimination of this kind. persons are commonly refused services where, for example, they are the worse for drink or unkempt or their dress is unsuitable for theparticular place; and if these grounds of refusal are to continue tobe available, they must apply to coloured as to white persons. Inthe nature of things it would, I think, be impossible to place on theprosecutor the responsibility of proving in every case that the refusal of services was due to discrimination on grounds of race or colour.I propose therefore to make it an offence to refuse to colouredpersons or to persons of a particular race services which areavailable at the place in question to other members of the public ingeneral, unless the accused can show that the substantial ground ofthe refusal was not race or colour.6. The offence would be a summary one with a maximumpenalty of  50 on first conviction and  100 on any subsequentconviction. I propose also to limit the right to prosecute to theDirector of Public Prosecutions for two reasons. First, the police,who are worried about the effect of new legislation on their relationswith the coloured population, are most unwilling to undertake the difficult and invidious task of prosecution. Secondly, it seems to meright, in principle, to include the additional safeguard of prosecutionby the Director against the bringing of proceedings on grounds otherthan the public interest. The creation of the new offence represents a considerable interference with the rights of the individual; and while I think this is fully justified it is, in my view, desirable to demonstrate that the circumstances of each case will be fully andimpartially considered before action is taken and that the law willbe consistently administered.7. I have set out in Appendix A a rough outline of theprovisions I have in mind. It will no doubt need alteration by parliamentary Counsel.Incitement to racial hatred8. Amendment of the law to make incitement to racial hatredan offence has been frequently proposed during the last 30 years.The case for it has been strengthened by developments since thewar-the growth in the coloured population; the immediate andnation-wide publicity given by television to any disorders; theindignation caused by propaganda of the &quot; Hitler was Right&quot; typeafter the years of Nazi persecution of the Jews. The problemremains, as it always has been, to frame a provision which willpenalise indefensibly scurrilous and inflammatory speeches orpublications without curtailing legitimate freedom of comment andcontroversy.
9. Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1936 provides that &quot; Any person who in any public place or at any public meetinguses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to provoke a breach of the peace or whereby a breach ofthe peace is likely to be occasioned, shall be guilty of an offence.&quot;After the disturbances caused in 1962 by minor Fascist leaders, suchas Colin Jordan, and their opponents, at public meetings, the public order Act 1963 increased the penalties under Section 5 of the act of 1936 from a maximum of three months&apos; imprisonment or a fineof  50 or both to a maximum of three months&apos; imprisonment and/ora  100 fine on summary conviction and 12 months&apos; imprisonmentand/or a  500 fine on conviction on indictment. During the passageof both Bills amendments were proposed which would have widenedtheir scope to penalise incitement to racial or religious prejudice,or to hatred on grounds of race, colour or creed. The view prevailed,however, that to make such incitement an offence would encroachunacceptably on the right of free expression and was too close to political censorship.10. There have been no recent troubles on the 1962 scale, andthere is at present less general concern about public meetings. the representations which I receive refer to written matter anti-Semiticarticles in Fascist news-sheets, swastika-daubing and the fly-postingof stickers of the &quot; nigger neighbour &quot; variety.11. The existing law is defective in dealing with writtenincitement. The common law offence of seditious libel (endeavouringto stir up hatred or hostility between different groups of The Queen&apos;ssubjects with the intention of promoting violence) has beenvariously interpreted, and, as the Caunt case showed, a conviction isnot easy to secure. At present offensive remarks can be disseminatedin writing provided that they are not obscene or blasphemous, orseditious in the comparatively narrow sense indicated above; and ascurrilous campaign could be mounted, e.g., against colouredimmigrants, on a sufficient scale to produce a considerable effectwithout falling foul of the law, in view of the difficulty of proving that publication took place &quot; with the intention of promoting violenceby stirring up hatred or hostility between different classes of the queen&apos;s subjects &quot;.12.   My present proposals, while they are designed to closethis gap in the law dealing with written incitement, would alsobroaden and strengthen the law on incitement to racial hatredgenerally. I am satisfied that the time has come when it is right and necessary to penalise deliberate incitement to racial hatred,oral or written, whether or not it can be shown that it was intendedor likely to cause a breach of the peace. My proposals are therefore^____r-i j .IWU1U1U .(a) The scope of Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1936 (seeparagraph 9 above) should be extended to include the dissemination of written matter which is threatening,abusive or insulting, with intent to provoke a breach ofCONFIDENTIAL5394 a 2
the peace or whereby a breach of the peace may beoccasioned. The penalties (as increased by the Act of1963) would be the same.(b) It should be made an offence for a person, with intent to stir up hatred against an ethnic or racial group, todisseminate written matter, or in a public place or at apublic meeting to use speech, which is threatening,abusive or insulting and likely to stir up hatred against that group on grounds of race or colour. It would thus be necessary to prove both thai the matter complained of was likely to stir up hatred on grounds of race orcolour and that the accused intended to stir up hatred;but, if it were shown that the matter was likely to stirup such hatred, it would be for the accused to satisfy the court that he did not intend to bring about thenatural consequence of his action. In my view a provision on these lines would strike a reasonable balance betweenthe preservation of freedom of speech and the protectionof racial groups from vicious attacks. I propose thatproceedings for this offence should not be institutedexcept by or with the consent of the Attorney-General:this should afford a further safeguard against proceedingsbeing taken in circumstances which would penalise orinhibit legitimate controversy.The provisions I have in mind would be broadly on the lines shownin Annexes B and C.Discrimination and incitement to hatred on grounds of religiousbelief13. The Home Affairs Committee invited me, in putting my proposals to the Cabinet, to refer to a difference of opinion in theCommittee on the question whether the proposed measures shouldbe applied to discrimination or to incitement to hatred onreligious grounds. Some members feared that a charge of racial discrimination might be met by the suggestion that the person inquestion was refused services, not on grounds of race, but because he was, for example, a Muslim; and that, in view of the attitude which the Labour Party had adopted in the past, it would be expectedthat the provisions against incitement would protect religious as wellas racial minorities. I doubt whether in practice the/e is a need for legislation to deal with discrimination or incitement on religiousgrounds; and I am anxious not to have to face a charge of preventingreligious or political controversy except where a clear case for doing so can be made out. Further, as regards incitement, Section 5of the Public Order Act already prohibits the use of offensivelanguage in a public place, irrespective of the persons attacked, ifthe result is intended or likely to be a breach of the peace. It would thus apply to abuse on religious grounds. So therefore wouldAnnex B. Annex C would only apply to race or colour origin; thatis something one cannot help.
Conclusion14. I seek my colleagues&apos; approval of my proposals and ofmy announcing to Parliament the Governments intention tointroduce legislation on these lines. Before making any announcementI propose to consult the Opposition informally with a view to reducing controversy in the House of Commons, and I will raise thequestion of timing again with my colleagues when I have done so,and I shall of course consult the Leader of the House and the chief whip about timing.F.
