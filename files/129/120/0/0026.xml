THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1965C. (65) 26 Copy No.      5 919th February, 1965-    CABINETCONTROL OF PRIVATE HOUSE-BUILDING by financial MEANSMemorandum by the Minister of Housing andLocal government at their meeting on 11th February about the housing programme (C.C. (65) 9th Conclusions, Minute 3) the Cabinet askedfor information about the steps which might be taken to limitprivate house-building if necessary. The Minister of public building and Works is submitting a paper on control by means ofbuilding licensing. A possible alternative approach to limitationof private house-building would be by controlling advances.2. Building societies dominate the market; it is estimated thatthey advance money on about 70 per cent of new houses. In 1964their advances came to about  1,050 million on existing as well as new houses compared with about  125 million each from localsauthorities and insurance companies. The amount of bank advancesis not known but is thought to be fairly small.3. Only a small proportion of building society advances are for the dearer sort of house. Recent returns suggest that in 1964about a quarter of building society mortgages were for housescosting over  4,000 including land: probably less than one-tenthwere for housing costing more than  5,000.4. We might be able to limit private house-building, whilestepping up the number built by public authorities and housing associations, if we could induce the lending bodies to accept a formof restraint which would reduce the overall scale of their lending for new house-building, especially in those areas where the buildingindustry is most overloaded. If it was thought worth while we might also get them to withhold advances for more expensive housesaltogether.5. Whether the building societies would co-operate voluntarilyin this if asked to do so we cannot tell without discussing with them.No scheme of voluntary restraint agreed with their representatives5402
could, however,.; be wholly ; effective, for it, would hardly be practicable to reach agreement with all the societies (of which thereare over 600); and policies on which the biggest might be persuaded to co-operate would not necessarily be accepted by some of thesmaller ones. The latter might partly frustrate the objective byattracting business which would otherwise be handled by those who did co-operate. We might therefore have to consider taking powersif it were thought that this is the right way to go.6. It is to be remembered here that we are pledged to make matters easier for house purchasers by providing purchase money at a preferential rate of interest. I shall shortly be bringing proposalsforward for this purpose. Negotiation will be needed with thebuilding societies, who would have to be the main agents forpassing on cheap money; and it will be necessary to agree withthem some limitation on the, amount of new house-building to bethus assisted. That would provide the opportunity for discussing with them the limitations we want in the interests of securing a bigger public programme.7. As regards lending by the banks and insurance companiesit is for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to advise whether theycould be asked to limit what they lend for new building.. I will be discussing this with him in the context of preferential rates ofinterest for house purchasers.8. If it is agreed that we should aim at a bigger publicprogramme there will, of course, be no need to make any specificannouncement about its intended size or about means of holdingthe private sector in check. All that would be announced, in theform of a circular to local authorities, would be that theGovernment wished to encourage building to let for general needs,especially in the areas where housing conditions are worst, and forthat reason, and in order to develop the use of industrialised methods,proposed to establish with the authorities programmes covering the next four years.R. H. S. C.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, SWA,18th February, 1965.
