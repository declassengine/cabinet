DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (65) 3 COPY NO.11th January, 1965CABINETCHILDREN^ SERVICE IN GREATER london memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Home department in accordance with the decision of the Cabinet on1st December (C. C. (64) 12th Conclusions, Minute 3) I have consulted the local authorities concerned, and the Associations of municipal corporations and County Councils, about proposals to confer on theGreater London Council certain functions relating to children in theGreater London Area.    The proposals are that the day-to-dayresponsibility for children1 s services should go to the boroughs as provided in the London Government Act 1963; but that the greater london Council should be given responsibility for approved schools and remand homes now run by the London and Middlesex CountyCouncils; for large children&apos;s homes and establishments which willhave to be shared among a number of boroughs; for keeping underreview the amount of accommodation available in the children&apos;service in London as a whole, with concurrent power to provide accommodation for use by more than one borough:  and for stafftraining, statistics and research, and the prescription of parentalcontributions and boarding-out allowances.2. The Greater London Council agree with the proposed changes.In their view they would enrich rather than detract from the duties ofthe boroughs, and would not create any bar to the localisation of thechildren&apos;s service.     The central management of certain establishmentswould leave the boroughs free to concentrate on essential localprovision of the kind that should in the long run replace the largerhomes and reception centres, and would ensure that specialisedestablishments are available for categories of children who mightnever be numerous enough to justify separate provision in eachborough.     The Council consider that in staff training it would be an advantage to develop for the whole area the schemes already initiated by the London County Council, with the boroughs taking the initiative in in-service training, and that the maintenance of records and statistics centrally would facilitate investigation into changing trendsand needs in the London area, and be a valuable background for localresearch.3. The minority party of the Greater London Council considerthat the proposals would be gravely detrimental to the children&apos;service.    They say that;the boroughs are fully competent to carryout the services (as county boroughs of varying size do elsewhere);that it would be wrong to have a two-tier service in addition to the supervision of the Home Office; and that the children&apos;s services arean integral part of the personal health services, which are being transferred to the boroughs.COMFSOENT3AL fa u

4.       The London boroughs were consulted collectively, and theGeneral Purposes Sub-Committee of their Standing Committeeaccepted the proposals in principle by 13 votes to 11.    The representa-tives of seven Labour-controlled boroughs and one Ccnservative-controlled borough were not present when voting took place (Barking,Brent, Croydon, Ealing, Greenwich, Haringey, Lambeth and TowerHamlets).    The Sub-Committee emphasise the sincerely helddifference of opinion which exists between members on principlesunderlying the changes proposed, and their general concern as to theeffect on the staff of the children&apos;s service if the uncertainty is pro-longed by delay before any amending legislation comes into force.In informing me of their decision in principle, they reserved the rightof each borough to make representations on detail during the passageof any Bill.5.       Representations strongly opposing the proposals have beenreceived from the boroughs of Barnet, Bromley, Croydon, Harrow,Merton, Redbridge and Westminster;  and Mr. Prentice and Mr. Gramhave written tome as the result of similar representations from theNewham Labour Party Co-ordinating Committee and the Labour group of the Ne.wh.am Council.    Wands worth concede that there may be some justification for transferring remand homes and approved schools butthey strongly oppose the rest of the proposals.6.       The Association of Municipal Corporations say that, havingcarefully considered the proposals in the light of the existingresponsibilities of county borough councils throughout the country,they would strongly oppose them..7.       The County Councils of Kent and Surrey have not yet decidedbut are likely to dissent from the proposals.    Essex appear to accept that there are grounds for treating London exceptionally.     The CountyCouncils Association believe strongly that the child care services?nould be a unified service, and tha.t Londonls problem should be capable of being met by joint action among the boroughs.     They arenot, however, likely to offer strong opposition to the Bill, wxcept perhaps as regards the approved schools.8.       Thus we must expect that any legislation would be opposed bythe minority party of the Greater London Council, the Association of municipal Corporations and a number of London boroughs, andpossibly by the County Councils Association.     The opposition islikely to be on the grounds that :-(a) a two-tier system is undesirable a.nd contraryto the principles of the Children Act 1943, which,in setting up the children&apos;s service, vestedresponsibility for all work relating to deprived children in a single committee in each localgovernment area;(b) residential provision o-aght to be an integral part   of the children&apos;s service, and should be managed by the authority which has the care of the children;

(c) the present borough plan to have a jointtraining organisation serving the health and welfare services, as well as thechildren!s service, is preferable to havingtraining done by the Greater London Council,which would not itself employ many of the grades of staff involved;(d) most of the headquarters staff requiredfor the Greater London Councils functions in respect of children could be found only by retaining staff at present due to go tothe boroughs; the boroughs would be hampered not only by the loss of staff butalso by the uncertainty which would existalmost until the appointed day.9.       There is substance in these objections, particularly, perhaps in those mentioned at (a) and (b) above, which are based on advicegiven by a group of the senior professional advisers to the London boroughs.    They would attract support from professional and other organisations who would no doubt provide opponents of a Bill withcogent arguments.    Our case for legislation rests on the specialcircumstances of London;  but our opponents would point out thatjoint arrangements have been made by the boroughs to meet thesecircumstances.     The situation will offer good opportunities fordelaying tactics.10.      We must also remember that individual boroughs who do not oppose the Bill as a whole may raise troublesome points of detailwhere their own interests are affected.    This applies particularly to the allocation of London County Council and Middlesex CountyCouncil children&apos;s service property.    After some 18 months1negotiations, schemes have been prepared to allocate this propertyamong the boroughs on an equitable basis.    The diversion of asubstantial proportion of the accommodation to the Greater london council as proposed would upset the balance of these schemes, and since there would not be enough time to re-negotiate the allocation of the remaining properties it might be necessary to allocate byMinisterial order, without the agreement of the authorities affected.11.      A draft Bill - which runs to 8 cla.uses and one schedule - is ready for consideration by the Legislation Committee immediatelyif we decide to adopt these proposals.    It would have to reach thestatute book by the end of February or the beginning of March inorder to leave time for the making of the necessary statutory instruments and other final steps by 31st March 1965.    Even so,staffing and other practical arrangements would be exceedingly difficult to make in the time available.F. S.Home Office, S. W. 1.11th January, 1965
