DOCUMENT IS THE PROPER.TY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(76) 137 COPY NO17 December 1976CABINETSESSION 1976-77:  LEGISLATIVE PROGRESS AND PROSPECTSMemorandum by the Lord President of the council. At our discussion in the Cabinet on 11 November I was asked to makeregular reports on the progress of the legislative programme.    My minuteto the Prime Minister of 24 November set out the order of priority which I proposed for the Bills with firm places in the programme.    Thismemorandum summarises Parliamentary progress so far, and looks aheadto the position which will face us after the Christmas Recess.PROGRESS SO FAR2.        We have surmounted those hurdles which had to be cleared before christmas, though in one or two cases with not much to spare.    The Scotlandand Wales Bill has secured its Second Reading.    The Aircraft and shipbuilding Industries Bill has been passed by the Commons, with the speaker&apos;s certificate that it complies with the requirements of the parliament act, and is now before the Examiners in the Lords;  their conclusion on whether the Bill is hybrid is expected by the end of the Recess, possiblybefore Christmas.    The Fisheries Limits and National Insurance SurchargeBills have been passed by the Commons, and Royal Assent is expected byChristmas.    The Social Security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is now inStanding Committee in the Commons.    The two major Lords Bills of the session (Criminal Law and Patents) h*ve been launched; the former hasreceived its Second Reading, and the latter has Opposition agreement to theuse of the Second Reading Committee procedure in the Commons. .POSITION AFTER CHRISTMAS:  GENERAL3.        The greater part of the Parliamentary time on the floor of the commons between Christmas and Easter will be taken up by the Scotlandand Wales Bill, on which we aim to make progress in Committee at the rateof two days a week; by Supply at Hie rate of one day a week; by PrivateMembers1 Bills on Fridays; and possibly by the Budget.    The rest of theavailable time will be devoted principally to making progress on the remaining1
Bills in Part L and th3 Bills in Part II, of the list attached to my minute of 24 November; but there will also be other unavoidable calls on this time,some of which might arise urgently, eg Rhodesia,    This it. a very heavyprogramme, and I remind colleagues of the limits imposed, both on the floor and in Standing Committee, by our voting strength.    The Chief Whipand I will do our best, but we cannot guarantee that all Bills will reachRoyal Assent by the date desired.    I shall adhere to the priorities set outin my minute of 24 November, on which I had few comments fromcolleagues, but will take account of the points made to me about the priority of the Transport (Finance) and Job Release Bills.AFTER CHRISTMAS:  INDIVIDUAL BILLS4.        Scotland and Wales.    The biggest single issue which faces us inmanaging the Parliamentary programme after the christmas recess is the handling of the Scotland and Wales Bill, and inparticular whether to seek an early timetable Motion.    Thisquestion will requira fine judgment, and I am still considering withthe other Ministers most concerned how we can best proceed.    i hope to put forward recommendations shortly.Water Charges Equalisation.    The opposition to this Bill which has developed made it imprudent to take Second Reading on a Friday, theonly time available before Christmas.    I will do what I can, but unless there is  some way of cutting down very considerably the time required between the Royal Assent and implementation of the newcharges(, it now seems unlikely that these charges could come intooperation next April,Food. Subsldie s.    Asa consequence of our recent decisions on public expenditure this Bill is no longer required.    The saving in parliamentary time, like the Bill, will be small, but nonethelesswelcome.Direct Labour Organisations.    This Bill is not yet ready for intro-ductlon, but the existing powers must be renewed by the end of March,while the proposed extensions of those pcwers will be highlycontentious,    I am in touch with the Secretary of State for. the environment about the handling of this Bill,It would be feasible, at the cost of some inconvenience, to combinethe Bills on the ECGD Liability limit, the IMF and OverseasRecources Development and Overseas Aid.    Doubts have been raisedby the Ministers responsible for these Bills whether the eaving in parliamentary time would be woi*th while and this question is to bediscussed by the Legislation Committee on 21 December,2
Homelesaneus.    This Bill would have the first call on any spareParliamentary time available, but Mr Stephen Ross MP who camefourth in the ballot for Private Members1 Bills he8 said that he wishes to promote a Bill on this subject.    The Ministers concerned are considering whether it would be practicable and desirable to lethim have the Government-drafted Bill.conclusions.        Colleagues will wish to take note of the position described above,    Ibelieve that the only issue on which collective discussion is required atpresent is the handling of the Scotland and Wales Bill.   At some point afterthe Recess we shall need to consider once more the Bill on Direct elections to the European Assembly, and to give some thought to the likely timing ofthe legislation on Price Control and Counter-Inflation.   Our next general review of progress on the legislative programme might usefully take place a ffvw weeks after Parliament has returned.M FPrivy Council Office17 December 19763
