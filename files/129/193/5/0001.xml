fSS DOCUMENT  5 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAjESTVS government cp(76)115 .COPY NO   0 126 November 1976CABINETBRITISH PETROUS UM SHARESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome DepartmentBACKGROUND1.        As part of the support operation for Burmah Oil, the Bank ofEngland at the beginning of 1975 bought for  179 million the 20 per cent of British Petroleum (BP) shares which were previously held by Burmah.The Sank undertook not to use the voting rights which these shares gave them and the Government undertook that there would be no change in theirexisting relationship with BP.2.        In February Ministers agreed that 2. 8 per cent of the BP sharesshould be transferred from the Bank to the Government to increase theGovernment&apos;6 existing shareholding of 48. 2 per cent to 51 per cent, andthat the remaining 17.2 per cent of BP shares held by fee Bank should be sold.    At current market prices, 17 per cent of BP shares are worth over 500 million.3.        There is, however, a major snag.    Burmah have started legal proceedings against the Bank far restitution of the BP shares sold at thebeginning of 1975.    Their claim is being resisted and legal advisers to both the Government and the Bank are confident that it will fail and thatit has only a nuisance value; but the mere existence of the claim createsa sufficient shade of doubt about the legal title to the shares to make itimpossible to mount a successful marketing operation.   An attempt will bemade by the Bank to persuade the Burmah Oil Company to substitute a purelyfinancial claim for their claim for restitution, if only for BP&apos;a sake; but theodds are against this succeeding.    The restitution claim will take 18 months to 2 years to go through the Courts.4.        If fee Government want to secure  450 -  500 million from the saleof BP shares in order to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement(PSBR) in 1977-78, the alternative to selling fee former Burmah shareholdingin BP would be to seJT an equivalent number of the shares now owned by theGovernment - fee legal title to which is not in doubt - and to replace them infee Governmentis portfolio by a transfer of shares from the Bank.    Burmah&apos;claim for restitution would then He against fee Government.    The danger -and the legal advice is that it is very slight indeed - is that if Burmah&apos;s claimsucceeded, the Government&apos;8 shareholding in BP would be reduced to31 per cent. ^
ISSUES5, The Ministerial Committee on Energy (ENM) under my chairmanshipconsidered the sale of BP shares on 24 November.    They were agreed that,if it proved possible to sell the former Burxnah shareholding in BP, therewould be no objection to doing so.    They also reached agreement on anumber of subsidiary questions arising from a possible sale.    But theywere unable to reach agreement on two questions:-a. whether in the last resort the Government Bhould be preparedto sell shares from their own portfolio on the basis described inparagraph 4 above;b, whether BP shares from either the Bank or Governmentportfolios could be sold to a foreign government, or to an organisation controlled by a foreign government (eg Deminex inGermany) if this seemed likely to yield the best price.6.        These are the two questions on which a Cabinet decision is now sought.SALE OF GOVERNMENTS SHARES7.        The arguments relevant to selling 17 per cent from the Governmentsholding are;-i. The over-riding need to get the reduction of c.  500 million in the PSBR *n 1977-78, and the fact that alternative measuresto achieve it - eg public expenditure cuts - would certainly bemore painful and probably also more difficult politically.ii. Until the Burmah claim is determined there must be somepossibility, however slight, that, having sold 17 per cent fromtheir own shares, the Government will subsequently have toreturn the former Burmah Bhares to Burmah, leaving her majesty&apos;s Government with only a 31 per cent holding.    But -a. all the legal advice is that Burmah^s claim will fail;b. under the arrangement Her Majesty&apos;s Government have with BP, our relations with the firm would be unchangedwhether the Government holding was 31 p*r cent, 48 per cent,51 per cent, or more.    (Anything over 25 per cent would still enable the two Government directors to retain their rightto a veto, which the Government have undertaken to exerciseonly where the national interest is at stake )2
riii.    Nevertheless, a 51 per cent shareholding does have asymbolic significance; and the latest version of the social contract, &quot;The Next Three Years&quot;, attaches great importance(in paragraph 20) to &quot;a clear expression of the Government&apos;amajority stake in British Petroleum Ltd .., &quot;.(iv)   The shares have been in the Government&apos;b ownership since1914, and were not sold even at the height of the Second world war, when many assets were liquidated.    Such an asset shouldnot be sold now - particularly when a possible rise in the priceof oil and the prospect of BP&apos;s Alaska operation becoming activeis likely to increase the value of the shares.(v)   It would be politically unattractive in Scotland for the westminster Government to be seen to be selling off a&quot;Scottish&quot; asset - BP has an interest in the Forties field.SALE TO FOREIGN government. This question arises whether it is Bank or Government ownedshares which are to be sold.    The relevant arguments are;-a. If sold overseas, the proceeds benefit not only the PSBRbut also the overseas balance - an important consideration in1977-76.b. It might be possible to obtain a better price from a privateplacing with, eg Deminex, than from mounting a market operation to disseminate the shares among a large number of smaller buyers.c. While the Government directors would still be in the positionindicated in paragraph 7 (U)b. above, the relationship between aforeign Government (Germany, Iran, another OPEC country?)and BP would seem bound to have some effect on the relationship between Her Majesty&apos;s Government and BP, and some conflict ofinterest could arise.conclusion.        There is no agreed recommendation on these two issues to put to cabinet from ENM.    In the context of the measures to reach an agreementwith the International Monetary Fund, the Government will need to knowwhether they can count on the receipt of up to  500 million from this sourceto reduce the PSBR in 1977-78,    It is therefore necessary to decide now inprinciple whether if it proves impossible to make arrangements which will permit early sale of the Bank-held, shares the Government would be readyto sell 17 per cent of the total of BP shares from its own holding and replace them by a corresponding number of shares from the Bank holding.3
10.      A decision is also needed on the further question; should the sale ofBP shares (whether from the portfolio of the Government or the Bank) to aforeign government or government-controlled body, be contemplated if thatwould maximise the price and benefit to the balance of payments ?M RHome Office36 November 19764
