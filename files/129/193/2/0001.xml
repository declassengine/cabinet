The Cabinet on 11 June endorsed proposals by the then Minister ofAgriculture Fisheries and Food (CP(76) 31) on procedures for agriculturalprice fixing in the European Economic Community.    The Prime minister in summing up the discussion said that Cabinet would wish to considerbefore the end of the year a further memorandum on our strategy towardsthe Common Agricultural Policy.    This subject has accordingly engagedthe attention of the Ministerial Committee on European Questions, whohave invited me, as their Chairman, to bring their conclusions beforeCabinet.    They are set out in the attached report.2.        Briefly we recommend as our main long-term aim the reduction in real terms of the support prices of those commodities where present policies produce structural surpluses.    At the same time we want tosecure continuing subsidies for our consumers from the Community^financial arrangements.    In present circumstances these benefits derivelargely from the effects of the Green Pound and this leads us to theconclusion that in the application of our strategy at the present time weshould not provoke a confrontation on the Common Agricultural Policy but should concentrate primarily on the short-term effects on British food prices of any Common Agricultural Policy decisions, in the interests ofour immediate economic policy.    We should be prepared, if necessary, totrade off a modest change in the Green Pound in order to obtain asatisfactory settlement on common prices.    But the recent increases inthe Monetary Compensation Amounts from 17 per cent to over 40 per centhas so altered the balance in our favour that our prime objective should beto hold the Green Pound, rather man to go for longer-term changes in theCommon Agricultural Policy at the expense of the Green Pound.A foreign and Commonwealth Office22 November 1976
CONFIDENTIALA STRATEGY FOR THE COMMON AGRICULTRUAL POLICYReport by the Ministerial Committee on European QuestionsOur Aims1.     Our basic aims on the CAP remain what they have always been: to minimiseits cost ot our balance of payments; to try to hold agricultural commodity prices in this country at the lowest levels consistent with the satisfactoryexpension of our own agriculture in accordance with the objectives set out inthe Government&apos;s White Paper &quot;Pood Prom Our Own Resources&quot;, and to reduceExchequer cost to acceptable levels; we must also continue to make satisfactory^provision&apos; for New Zealand and the Commonwealth sugar producers and to obtain   ,a more liberal policy of food imports from outside the Community,2.     Against this background, the detailed changes required by the UK can benarrowed down to four essential points;(a) Support prices.    Our aim should be to reduce tha level of prices in real terms, thus not only providing that &quot;supplies reach consumersat reasonable prices&quot; (as envisaged by Article 59(0 (e) of the Treatyof ^ome) but also eliminating the structural surpluses of food created by the present policy.(b) Consumer subsidies.    Our aim should be to secure continuing PEOGAsubsidies to UK consumers, whether as monetary compensatory amountsor in other forms, to the maximum extent consistent consistent with thelong-term continuation of such subsidies and with our own plans foragricultural expansion in the UK,    This could be the most effective meansof securing a satisfactory balance of advantage between ourselves andmember countries whose economies are stronger than ours or who gain fromthe CAP as net exporters.
(c) World trade. Our aim should be to achieve a better management ofiexport subsidies under the CAP, although the achievement of a low-ering of support prices would inevitably help in this.   But the sub-committee felt that the present system was both inept and inequitable:inept in that it creates absurdities such as cut-price sale of butter toRussia, and inequitable in that by subsidised dumping in third countrymarkets it is restrictive of world trade.  On imports . we should continueito press for more liberalisation of trade with third countries(d) Different financing of rehabilitation of poor farmers .  Our ai m shouldbe to make this wholly desirable social change a charge upon social &apos;ipolicy, rather than a charge upon consumer prices.   It should be theduty of national exchequers to take a bigger share of the social costs of farm support.Objectives (a) and (b) arise directly in the price-fixing and would contribute to all the basic aims set out in paragraph 2, provided always that we leave roomto expand our own agriculture.   The objectives set out in (c) and (d) however donot arise directly in the price fixing and-could not by their nature be finallysecured as part of it.   Their main significance is financial and more work is needed to establish more precisely what changes would be to our advantage.Our first priority should therefore be to secure the best balance betweenobjectives (a) and (b).4.    Of the points detailed above, each has its difficulties from tne political point of view, since rightly or wrongly the other eight member governments are convinced that they require the farmers&apos; votes to preserve them in office.But the greatest difficulty arises in considering the support prices, since the eight member states would look at the commodities item by item.   Thesituation can be summarised as follows!Milk  A large, daunting and very costly surplus - much the worst andmost difficult problem.a
Cereals   The e.c. normally has a costly surplus of milling wheat, but a netimport requirement of feed grains.Beef   The recent surplus will be followed, according to the normal beef production cycle, by a requirement for imports      over the next two years.Suffar   The e.c. is in surplus after taking account of its annual imports ofACP sugar, but the sugar price is regarded as too low by Commonwealth sugarproducers.Olive Oil   A costly and inefficient system, which isoperated for Italy1sbenefit,   Greek accession will mean a big surplus.Wine   There is a surplus, and a big one in years of high yield, but theproblem is mainly limited to France and Italy,Attitude of other member states5,     Clearly the major question of support prices concerns milk products, and this in turn is confirmed by cur own experience in the UK.   We stated in &quot;Food from our Own Resources&quot; that &quot;most benefit is likely to come from higher output of milk&quot; in relation to the long-term prospects for British agriculture (and, we might have added, for the British consumer).   But the aims of France, Belguim,Luxembourg and Ireland are to protect their milk producers by high prices, whilewhittling down the amount of milk produced in the Community by paying for adecrease in the number of cows.   This will, therefore, be a sticking point forthem.   On the other hand, Germany opposes milk price increases but is preparedto accept themfif she can get bigger increases in cereal prices,6.     The continuance of consumer subsidies implies the indefinite retention also of something akin to the MRCA system at whatever level both accords with ourposition as the biggest importer of foodstuffs and our need to expand our ownagriculture to cut down on imports.   All the other member states would oppose afcmally permanent system, but some would be prepared to agree that we should determine the pace of change.
9,     It would seem that we could get allies in each of the four changes w*seek, especially if we were to have bilateral discussions with the other member states - a tactic mode easier by our Chairmanship of the Council ofMinisters from January to June next year, since bilaterols are part of thenormal price-fixing prooess.   The difficulty is, however, to arrive at *package which all the other eight could accept.   It will take tine to achi^lour aims and we should not therefore provoke a confrontation at the nextfixing.7,     The countries most interested in maintaining export subsidies as a regular mechanism are France, Denmark and the Netherlands, all of whom have     -!a traditional export trade with third countries.   But since export restitutionare a more cost-effective instrument thati intervention, most of the eightwould doubtless fight for them, though they might be prepared to look at the ;question.   On liberalisation of imports we hope to make some progress on agriculture in the multilateral trade negotiations (MTN) which should startmoving again next year.   The strongest opposition to concessions on agriculutre^.has come from France and Ireland, who argue that the principles and mechanis&apos;1of the CAP cannot be altered to suit non-Community countries.   But Germany,Italy and the Netherlands all have a big interest in getting a success on th*&apos;industrial side end will not let the MTN fail because of a too rigid stanceon agriculture.   Apart from the MTN, we can pursue various ad hoc improvementparticularly for the developing countries (through the Generalised PreferenceScheme of the ACP agreement) which can be accepted by the other members forgeneral foreign policy reasons.8. Different financing of rehabilitation of poor farmers would mean refluentthe percentage contribution by FEOGA to various existing schemes and to fut^schemes. The Italisans and Irish would be against any re-opening of decision that have already been taken in this field. The French might be willing toaccept it, provided they got greater freedom in the manner of paying suchaids at the national level, but this latter concession would be opposed by ^Danes and Dutch,
-11 Itf     t t**the Green Pound10.   We had intended &quot;to consider CAP strategy separately^ froitt.matters that arise on the ^reen pound.     Bit as the-points in-paragraphs(b) and 6 above show, it is not possible to disentangle tlic two questions;and it is widely believed that the green pound itself could be used as a ncg-otiatiny factor in obtaining changes in the CAP,11.     In tho short term, it is clearly the green pound that has the biggestimpact Jn keeping food prices in Britain at a rcasonablc level; the gap between the green pound and the market rote has widened so greatly (theMCA increased from 17.4 per cent to 40.6 per cent in the six months bclweon1 May ond 1 November this year) that it has far more influence on our food prices than any annual change in the common support prices.  On the otherhand, any increase in the common prices docs directly affect the level ofprico support in Britain both now and at the end of the transitional period;it affects us indirectly thrcu gh its influence on tho level of European surplusesand therefore our contribution to expenditure from the farm budget; and if inthe long term we eventually do align the green pound with the market rate,then only tho common prices will matter anyway.&apos;12..    Therefore, whether it would be in the national interest for us to trade  short term disadvantage on food prices (fixing the groen pound at a lower level than we want) for a long term benefit (keeping the common prices below what they would otherwise have been) would depend on the orders of magnitude-tude involved and on the priorities of our own economic management.   Adevaluation of the green pound of x per cent, in return for avoiding an increaseof y per cent in the common prices,could in tliu long tcr-:i lv &quot;-ortiuwiilefalternatively an increase in the common prices could he a price- worth p.-yi:for the short t.*rm maintenance of the green pound at near its present r:&quot;.: .In the absence of detailed analysis,   we were not in a positionto put figures on such a trade-off.
13.    There has been strong pressure on us from the Commission and the other (*member states to accept a devaluation of the green pound, if only by a ^okeBamount.    The Commission has launched a proposal for an automatic mechanismfor changes in green currencies and reductions in the size of MCAs; bothand the Germans opposed this suggestion at the joint meeting of Agricultureand ^finance Ministers in Luxembourg on 26 October, and the Minister ofAgriculture, fisheries and Food will be submitting a separate paper on it *fl^.CQM shortly.    The view has been expressed - for example, by the Member of ^Commission responsible for agriculture, Mr Lardinois - that if the UK refuse^to devalue the green pound in any circumstances, or blocks any attempt tohave an automatic system for reducing MCAs, this means the end of the CAP.   vthought that this vi*w was greatlyexaffjerated, and that it -was net currentshared by other member governments.    If such a view did become generally accepted by other members, Cabinet would olearly have to decide whether toaccept this possibility and its consequences.Conclusions on Strategy1U,    We should not provoke a confrontation on the CAP but should concentra*flprimarily on the short-term effects on British food prices of any CAP deoi91&apos;in the interest of our immediate eoonumic policy.   We should be prepared, 1neoessary, to trade-off a modest change in the green pound in order to obt^a satisfactory settlement on oommon prices*.    But the recent increase   in iVMCA from 17 per cent to over 40 per cent has so altered the balance in our favour that our prime objective should be to hold the green pound, rather **fto go for longer-term changes in the CAP at the expense of the green poufl3.*Kote:   For the purposes of assessing a settlement on common prices, Anne*to this paper shows what the effect of price increases would be on the G0^[budget and on the UK&apos;a contribution to it.

A STRATEGY FOR THE CCITOIT AGRICULTURAL POLICYBUDGET COST OF&quot;CAP PRICE increases the attached table illustrated the possible consequences for theCommunity Budget and UK. contribution of various levels of price increases for the main CAT products.   It is based on the bestassumptions which can be made about market prospects for individualproducts and it assumes no change from current exchange rates andgreen currency levels and no change in CAP support mechanisms.   Theestimates are based on an average e.c. rate of inflation of 8%.For the purpose of the table it has also been assumed that the effect        /on the. budget represents the situation once the full consumption and production response to a price increase has worked through.   It wouldbe meaningless to assume otherwise, but this introduces a high degree of artificiality into the calculations.   Por those commoditieswith a long production cycle it could take 18 months or longer forthe production response to be felt; and over such a time scale itis difficult to foresee clearly what would be the effect of normalmarket trends.   The time scale also affects directly the cost ofsurpluses to the Community budget; for example in the short-term, asassumed here, milk products can be stored relatively cheaply, butonce they have to be disposed of the cost is higher.In order to estimate effects on the Community budget it has alsobeen necessary to make assumptions about the size of budgetaryexpenditure and of the UK contribution.   The table is needed inthe context of price increases in the next CAP price-fixing and theeffects of those increases would apply partly in 1977 but also in1978 and succeeding years.   The table takes as the best working basis the Commission forecasts for the 1977 budget and assumes that the UKcontribution will be subject to the 1977 *cey of 19.2^% - though, ofcourse this is unrealistic to the extent that the effect we are dis-cussing will be felt in 1978 and later when we shall be paying a biggercontribution.   The first column in the table gives expenditure fromdeflated to take account of the effect 01 the assumed&amp;ed      fall in
real prices.   The budget key is not applied to each individualcommodityt but it is fairly simple to do this by taking roughlyone-fifth of the figure given.Finally, this table only purports to show a budgetary effect.   Itdoes not deal with consumer price effects, or with costs acrossthe exchanges which would give some indication of resource costs.Miriictry of Agricitlture, Fisheries. &amp; Food16 Eovcnber 19762.

Annex B* A devaluation of the Representative Bate (Green Found) would automatically increase in sterling terms the various institutionalCAP prices applicable in the UK; reduce   the level of MCAs paid on imports; and raise   the maximum guaranteed price for milkpermitted by e.c. Regulations.   If market prices already exceedintervention prices, the increase in Wholesale and so retail pricesmight be less.   In addition, the price of liquid milk is set by theGovernment, and does not automatically rise on a devaluation.Assuming an increase in the liquid milk retail price sufficient to     /fund the maximum permitted rise in the price guaranteed to fanners,devaluations of the representative rate by 5* 10 or 15 per centmight have the following effects on the BPI and Pood Index	5%	10%	15%Retail Price Index	*		1Pood Index	1*	2*	4These effects assume that the reduction of MCAs is generallyreflected in market prices.   The figures for the Food Index wouldbe smaller by up to one-third if the price of milk were not increased.It is not realistic to attempt estimates of the effect of greaterdevaluations because they would require alternative assumptions onthe milk guarantee and because it is impossible to predict how marketsmight react in the face of such large changes in institutional supportprices and MRCA levels.
