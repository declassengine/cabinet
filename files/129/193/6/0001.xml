DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAjESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT0 iCP(76)116 COPY NO30 November 1976CABINETTHE CASE FOR AND AGAINST IMPORT CONTROLSNote by the Central Policy Review staff. In response to a remit from the Ministerial Committee on economic strategy, the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS) circulated to that committee on 14 October 1976, two papers: the first of these provided thecase for general protection and the second the case against it.    The twopapers were put forward as &quot;lawyer^ briefs&quot; and no attempt was made todraw conclusions as to which was the most persuasive.    These papersare now circulated to Cabinet as background to the discussions on theInternational Monetary Fund loan.2.        No changes have been made to the papers as they were originallycirculated but, if revisions were to be made, the CPRS would wish toemphasise in the second paper, The Case Against, tho necessity for legislation.Cabinet Office30 November 1976
c(secret)THE ALTERNATIVE STRATEGYTHE CASE FOR IMPORT CONTROLSINTRODUCTIONThe Problem - Britain&apos;s Secular Economic Decline1.        There is no dispute as to the basic long term problem.   It isthe need to reverse Britain&apos;s secular economic decline.   In comparisonwith that of its main competitors, Britain&apos;s economic performancesince the war has been, in almost every sense, poor;  a low rate of growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP);  a low rate of growth of investment;  a low share of investment in GDP, and a low level of investment per worker;   slow export growth;  increasing importpenetration and a falling share of world trade;  falling employment;a deteriorating trade balance and low productivity growth in manu-facturing.   A story of relative decline.2.       If Britain is to have a future as a high wage, high output economy,the relative decline of the past 30 years must be reversed.   Yet sincethe 1960s this relative decline appears to have accelerated.   over recent cycles unemployment and inflation have risen to progressivelyhigher levels, the balance of payments has gone deeper and deeper in deficit.   It will be argued in this note that under present policies theprospects for reversing this decline during the remainder of the 1970sare equally poor.    In 1980-81 North Sea oil and gas will ease our balance of payments problems;  but for the next four years any attemptto reduce the current unprecedentedly high rate of unemployment byreflating the home market is ruled out for balance of payments reasons.Even if exports did expand as planned, the weakness of the home market would inhibit the major turn-round we need.1(secret)
(secret)THE GOVERNMENTS CURRENT STRATEGYIndiistrJaJ^Regejiera^n3.Without a substantial improvement in the performance of manufacturing there is little prospect of breaking out of thevicious cycle of low growth, low investment, falling employment and high inflation.   The Government is rightly committed to securing a major improvement in the industry&apos;s performance.4.       The industrial strategy was launched with this aim in mind.By identifying high priority growth sectors and by finding ways of improving their performance - through planning agreements,restructuring, financial aid under the Industry Act and throughthe National Enterprise Board and so on - it is hoped to bringabout a significant change in industrial performance.5.       But this initiative will not be sufficient on its own.   TheGovernment has recognised that it will need to be reinforced bymacro-economic policies designed to create conditions that will encourage investment, growth and the rebuilding of the industrialbase.    Continuity of Government policy on taxation, investment incentives, etc, the expectation of a high and sustained rate of growth of output, little or no growth in public expenditure overthe next five years, a competitive exchange rate and an increasedshare of profits in national income are all essential for creatingthe sort of climate within which industry can invest with confidence.6. The basic doubts about this policy over the long term arewhether the Government can and will set the necessary macro-policy framework for the industrial strategy to work.    In the 1980sour balance of payments problems will have been eased by Northoil and gas and the old &quot;stop-go&quot; fears of changes in government policy for balance of payments reasons may, in time, fade from 
(secret)manufacturers&apos; minds.     But the worries on import penetrationwill still remain.    Indeed, to the extent that North Sea oil and gas lead to a strengthening of the exchange rate they could becomestronger.The Immedi^te^JP Pj?iH^i^ HIS, the sjrategy    the balance ofpayments and inflation7.       The regeneration of industry is a long term objective.   the fruits of the Governments initiative in industrial policy will not beachieved overnight.   But while waiting for an underlying improve-ment in Britain&apos;s economic performance, improving the balanceof payments and reducing the rate of inflation still have to beachieved.    The Governmenfs strategy in these fields involves -i. relying on the social contract with the Trades UnionCongress (TUC) to reduce still further the rate of inflationboth during and beyond the current pay round;ii. establishing a level for the exchange rate that will bothenable the current account to reach balance by 1979 (giventhe prospects for inflation in the United Kingdom relative tothat of our competitors) and will allow the maximum feasiblegrowth of manufacturing output in the process;iii. covering the current account deficits and any outflowson the capital account between now and 1979 by furtherborrowing, from abroad   -  the IMF, the Eurodollar markets,the Group of 10;iv. controlling the domestic economy through tight fiscal policy and through control on public expenditure to enableresources to be switched into the balance of payments asworld trade grows over the next three years;(secret)
(secret)fitv.      reinforcing the whole strategy by tight monetary policyand a steady reduction in the PSBR,8.       By sticking to these policies the economy should be in a position by the end of the decade to take the fullest possible benefit from north sea oil.     Debts accumulated since the oil crisis of 1973-74 can thenbe repaid and the remaining benefits of North Sea oil used to reinforce the industrial strategy.9.       There are several doubts about this policy.   First, the exchange rate depreciation necessary to achieve balance and a fast rate of growth of manufacturing output may be so large (or unobtainable inan orderly way) that it puts at risk the social contract and theprospect of a falling rate of inflation.   Secondly, the social contractmay not hold anyway in the face of continued unemployment.   Thirdlyiwith a weak home market and very high interest rates, investment m. manufacturing may not increase adequately.  &apos; And lastly workersmay be unwilling to accept revised manning standards and raiseproductivity when unemployment is high.AN ALiTE^NA-T^VE-STRATEGY10.     Britain&apos;s relative economic decline since the war must be seen in the context of a worldwide trend towards trade liberalisation.First, there was the dismantling of physical controls during the tenyears after 1945.     That was followed in the 1950s and 1960s by successive rounds of reductions in tariffs.   And the European Econo^1&apos;Community (e.c.) and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA)hastened the process towards total free trade in Europe.    Withhindsight, Britain did not benefit as much from this movement towards free trade as did other countries.   Some of them - germany in particular - benefited greatly from the rebuilding of their industries(secret)
(secret)with modern equipment after extensive devastation during the war.Others - Japan is a good example - were able to develop new industries, in particular, and their economies, in general, behindtrade barriers which were only removed when they were in aposition to compete effectively in world markets.   Britain, onthe other hand, was left with her capital stock run-down, an economycompletely open to foreign competition and with debt repayment,exports and rearmament taking priority over industrial re-equipment.11,      With this competitive advantage and increasingly liberal world trade, Britain&apos;s main competitors were able to increase their shares of world trade in the 1950s.    For these other countries, the balanceof payments, far from being a constraint on domestic expansion, wasa cause of relatively fast output growth.    They built up a momentumof fast output growth, fast investment growth, fast productivity growth and so on.12.      The reverse occurred in Britain.   Without the benefit of a moderncapital stock, without the ability to compete in an increasinglycompetitive world, the balance of payments, especially with a fixedexchange rate, became the major constraint on growth.   &quot;Stop-go&quot;cycles, induced by domestic demand management policies to protect the balance of payments, created uncertainty and had adverse effects on the rate of investment.   Output grew slowly and was expected to grow slowly, there was little incentive to invest, capacity constraintsappeared in each successive boom and import penetration increased.The process became one of cumulative decline - a process that seemsto have accelerated in the 1970s.13.     On this analysis the solution lies basically in raising the rate of growth of industrial capacity, modernising plants and products, and improving the utilisation of labour with a higher level of capital per5(secret)----   ........ &apos;--......--... -....., n     i   ywlf
worker. This will involve major reorganisation (includingchanges in shopfloor attitudes and practice) and investmentacross manufacturing industries.   But attempting to do this withan open economy in the context of increasing world competitionmuch of British industry, in the face of competition both fr&quot;mmore advanced high productivity industries (especially in japan and some of the countries of the e.c.) and from cheap labourcountries elsewhere, is now so great that free trade is ceasingto be of benefit to the United Kingdom.     It is essential to havea period during which industry can expand and invest without thefears (i) that balance of payments constraints will require theGovernment to deflate;  and (ii) that increasing foreign competitionwill lead to the continued loss of export markets and higher levels of import penetration will steal the home market.    The historicalrecord shows that no country has ever made a major industrialleap forward while, at the same time, leaving its economic frontierscontinually open to penetration by its more advanced competitors.The Form of Protection14. There are, broadly, four main ways of &quot;protecting&quot; our home industry.    They are -and a slow-growing home market suffering severe importpenetration, would be extremely difficult.    The weakness of1.subsidies;ii.dropping the exchange rate;iii.tariffs;iv.quota s.6
(secret)Subsidies are in principle flexible in that one can adapt the subsidy to the needs of the industry, but the public expenditure/taxationimplications rule them out as a major general instrument acrossall manufacturing industry.   Dropping the exchange rate isinflexible in that it affects all industries equally but, above all,is uncertain.   The Government cannot be at all sure how far theexchange rate would have to fall to achieve the desired effect andindustry has no way of knowing how far the Government would allowor want it to fall.   Tariffs are flexible in that they can be tailoredto the industry but uncertain in their effect in that their degree ofprotection depends on movements in the exchange rate.   Onlyquotas are both flexible and certain.   The degree of protection isindependent of the exchange rate and of the price mechanism.15.     Quotas to limit the total value of imports would therefore givethe most certain and effective protection to industry.   They would need -a. wide coverageb. to be kept on for long enough for the necessary industrial reorganisation and investment to go ahead with confidence;c. to be operated as flexibly as possible in order to minimise the risk of shortages of components, etc: provision for allowingat least part of the quotas to be bought and sold on an open market could help here.The International Implications16.     Unilateral action to introduce general import restrictions would beregarded by our e.c. partners, our NATO allies, and the IMF, as a grossbreach of our international undertakings.   Their immediate reactionwould be to try and dissuade us from going ahead with any such scheme.iL(secret)
(secret)This discussion would initially take the form of extreme diplomaticpressure, and refusal to lend,17.      Whether we could effectively stand up to such pressures is amatter of political judgement.   We would have to persuade our alliesthat Britain&apos;s problem is a structural one which short term measures will not solve - it may be possible to insist to our allies that a long period of protection is the only answer.   Past experience shows noconvincing reason why if present policies are continued Britain wouldnot otherwise find herself with the same fundamental disequilibriumon the balance of payments in ten years&apos; time as she does now.   Alsothe traditional method of closing balance of payments deficits   -devaluation and deflation   -  would damage their exporting industriesjust as protection would.   If quotas lead to a prosperous Britain, agood market and a good ally, they are better for the trading worldthan a continuing sickly free trade partner.     If we cannot persuade them of this, we shall have to go it alone.18.      In trying to convince our allies of the seriousness of our positionwe should seek to demonstrate that Britain&apos;s situation is so adversethat international economic law justifies the use of import controls -a. Article XII of the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT) allows the, use of general import restrictions to protect the balance of payments if they are necessary (theIMF determines whether they are necessary) to protect a country&apos;s foreign exchange reserves.   This exactly meets thecurrent problem;b. Article 108 of the e.c. Treaty of Accession allows a country(with the authorisation of the e.c. Commission) to take measuresto protect its balance of payments where, in the absence of such measures, the operation of the Common Market or the gradualachievement of the common commercial policy would be jeOpa*dl8(secret)
Balance of Payments^21.     An interdepartmental groujj has studied the effects of a schemeof import controls,  introduced at the beginning of 1977 to last forthree years?    The scheme would involve quotas on just Over 90 percent of imports of consumer goods, 72 per cent of capital goods,26 per cent of semi-manufactures,  5 per cent of basic materials and19 per cent of food, beverages and tobacco   -  overall on about 25 percent of all imports.    Cuts of either 20 per cent or 50 per cent below1975 volumes would be imposed on those imports covered.*EY(76)48(secret)-19.      The risks of actual retaliation are difficult to assess.   some major trading countries, at least, would probably be reluctant totake any significant retaliatory action until other means of dissuadingus had failed,  because they would not want to start a trade war whichmight spread, and because they would not want other deficit countries to follow our example.      (It has to be remembered that UK importquotas would affect only some 3 per cent of world trade.)       the longer we maintained the restrictions,  the more likely we are to provoke retaliation.   On the other hand,  if the alternative strategy were seen to be working, our competitors might be induced to hold atheir hands. IThje^U^rnajjvejt^^20.     A policy of protection by quotas is mainly aimed at reversingover the decade ahead the long term decline in British manufacturing.But it would also have advantages in the short term.    These advantagesare considered under four heads:   balance of payments;   employment;inflation;   living standards.
22,      The objective of this scheme is to close the gap on the current balance as soon as possible and thus reduce to a minimum the needfor further borrowing abroad.    They would have little effect in thefirst year but would, by about the second half of 1978, have built upsufficiently to turn the current account into surplus,   A certainamount of borrowing to cover the intervening current account deficitand any shortfall on capital account would still be required.    The size of this external borrowing requirement would depend greatly on howforeign official and market opinion reacted to our change of strategy-With a favourable reaction (i.e. they accepted it as a necessary andwise change) then we could borrow adequately from the IMF and theGroup of 10, and the sterling balances would probably not be withdraw11&apos;If they reacted unfavourably, then we would have to consider measuresadditional to quotas to protect our balance of payments.   These could include import deposits (which would have to remain until quotas hadrestored our balance of payments and would probably not provide adequate foreign exchange);   stricter exchange controls on current and capital transactions;   guaranteeing (or freezing) the sterling balances.   But by 1979 the annual current balance would haveimproved (assuming no retaliation and no change in fiscal poll, y)by some  5 billion compared to present policies.   And if the controlslasted for longer and we achieved a surplus they would obviouslycontribute greatly to the repayment of the external debt accumulatedsince the oil crisis of 1973-74.23.     Under present policies, unless we achieve major medium termloans from both the IMF and the Group of 10, the exchange rate is bound to remain vulnerable for the next three years.     If it slidesunpredictably, import prices will rise very sharply again and the10(secret)
(secret)social contract could break down.    In the short term the fall in sterling would make the balance of payments worse and the external borrowing requirement still larger and more difficult to meet.   Under thealternative strategy the period before sterling becomes a strongcurrency again (with a balance of payments surplus) is halved.   Thisprospect alone should make it easier to get through the next 18 months.But if need be the alternative strategy on imports will have to be accompanied by a companion alternative strategy on exchange control.Era pi oyment24.       The forecast used by the Inter-departmental Group for theiranalysis of an import restriction scheme (EY(76)48) shows that on thebasis of the Government^ current strategy (relying on the growth of world trade to increase exports and output) there is little prospect of reducing unemployment significantly below its current level by the endof the 1970s if, at the same time, balance on the current account is tobe achieved by 1979.   In other words, the current strategy will notgenerate the demand to allow manugacturing output to expand fastenough to take up all the existing spare capacity in industry either because the exchange rate is still not sufficiently competitive or becauseof the need to maintain overtight monetary or fiscal demand managementpolicies for external reasons.25.        The interdepartmental exercise on a possible quota scheme(described above) shows how beneficial protection could be (alwaysassuming that there is no retaliation by other countries).   By raising the rate of growth of manufacturing output over the next 3 years to itsfeasible maximum, unemployment would be some 300, 000 lower at theend of 1979 than it would otherwise be.   Given the impossibility ofreflating with our present balance of payments prospects, it is clearthat import controls are the only way to reduce unemployment by any significant amount within the lifetime of this Parliament.11(secret)
Lnfla t ion26.      Forecasting the rate of inflation,  especially that of wages,under the alternative strategy,  is a particularly hazardous procedure.There is no .way of knowing how wages and prices would behavewhether or not protection is introduced.      But the achievement ofa satisfactory agreement with the TUC on wages would be made that much easier if unemployment had some prospect of being significantly reduced in the short term (and import controls would provide thatopportunity).27.     As for the non-wage pressures on prices, there is little reasonto believe that import prices would rise under a system of importquotas.   And the Cambridge Economic Planning Group believe thatthere would be virtually no effect on the price of domestically-produced import substitutes, despite the fact that they would nolonger be subject to foreign competition.   Price control would, inany case, prevent a major increase in domestic prices.Living Standards28.     The difficulties of estimating the relative inflation rates underthe.two strategies carry over into, and form part of, the difficultyof estimating the effect on living standards.    It is clear that underthe alternative strategy output would be higher but more would need to go into the balance of payments (because the gap is closing faster).What is not clear is how much more.       This is because we have toallow for any effect of the alternative strategy on the UK terms of trad*A plunge in sterling would mean worse terms of trado, a slightly lowerreal national income and a redistribution of income in favour of profit9(mainly in the exporting industries).    If the alternative strategyreduced the deterioration in the terms of trade and the shift to profitt12(secret)
(secret)living standards would be that much higher than under present policies.Possibly the best assumption is that the effect on average living standards in the United Kingdom over the three years is likely to bepositive but small.    But 300, 000 people will be at work rather thanunemployed and the prospects for higher living standards in the years ahead after that much more secure because the manufacturing basewill be expanding faster.Implications for Fiscal Policy (Public Expenditure and Taxation)29-       It is sometimes assumed that one unpleasant aspect of the&quot;alternative strategy&quot; would be the need for a still tighter fiscal policy.   That is to say for yet more public expenditure cuts or increased taxation.     In March 1976 the Cambridge Group argued that in order to limit the rise in total demand under protectionthere &quot;may&quot; have to be an increase in the tax burden.     This risein the tax burden - if it proved necessary - could either come fromexplicit tax increases, or fromfailure to increase tax allowances in line with inflation.    (An alternative, of course, would be public expenditure reductions.)30.        The issue is a complicated one - as is the question of thealternative strategy and living standards.   The conclusion, as withliving standards,  is that there is unlikely to be much effect but if anything the fiscal problem would probably be a little easier underthe alternative strategy rather than more difficult.31.        This is because the alternative strategy means an automaticreduction in the public sector deficit.    Higher output and lowerunemployment (both absolutely and in relation to present policies)mean less payments for social security and industrial assistance,13(secret)
(secret)more receipts from taxation (PAYE, and taxes on expenditure),possibly more receipts from sales of import licences.     against this there is the need to ensure adequate resources for the higherindustrial investment which the strategy will stimulate and forthe faster closing of the balance of payments gap-     Both these requirements mean that consumption must not increase too fast.On balance, the automatic reduction of the PSBR should be enough,probably more than enough, to provide the necessary restraint.Whether this would be so depends crucially on the Uehaviour of thecurrent balance of payments under the alternative strategy.     If itfailed to improve as fast as was needed because exports were being diverted to the home market (quotas will prevent increased imports),then the Government would have to consider deflating.    But theywould be more likely to consider increasing the tax on exportablegoods rather than cutting public expenditure.       But if the productionof exportable goods is expanded at the rate set out in the inter-departmental study, the alternative strategy would require neitherpublic expenditure cuts nor increased taxation to achieve its objectives-CONCLUSIONS32.        The first and crucial argument for the adoption of an-alternativestrategy is that the present strategy is clearly not working now, thatit will not work over the crucial years 1977-80, nor yet again overthe longer term.33.       At present balance of payments pressures (both current accountdeficits and capital outflows) are requiring monetary and fiscalpolicies which inhibit investment and the essential industrial regenerate011Even the present tough measures to protect sterling are no guarantee that over the next two years sterling will not fall sharply and far.14(secret)
(sec r e t)We do not have in sight sufficient medium term loans to supportthe currency if current and capital account pressures come heavily on the rate.     The danger then is that over the next two yearsfailure on industrial regeneration will be accompanied by failure on inflation as the falling pound,  rising import prices, highermortgage rates, high unemployment lead to a non-renewal of thesocial contract and a return to wage settlements of 20 per certor more.34.        Protection by quotas is thus the only viable way of attacking /)the cause of Britain&apos;s long run economic decline and of laying the foundations for fast economic growth in the future.      It would help jclose the balance of payments gap faster, help (possibly buttressedby capital controls) avoid the potentially destabilising effects offurther runs on sterling.    It is the only way of reducing unemployment to any significant extent within the lifetime of this Parliament.15(secret)
f secret&quot;)THE ALTERNATIVE STRATEGYTHE CASE against. The case for a strategy based on import restrictions (QRs) set out inEY(76) 49 looks strong.    But, in fact, it is a theoretical case, which willnot stand up in practice.    It does not offer a real alternative because:-a. it ignores the practical implications of the immediate situation; ^b. it disguises, or assumes away, a number of fundamentalindustrial and economic difficulties, which will in practice prevent it from achieving the results claimed for it.I - THE EXTERNAL SCENEThe Immediate situation. The events of the past few weeks have shown that we cannot afford toallow sterling to find its own level in the foreign exchange markets.     with confidence so weak, no-one knoWs at what rate we might end up.    A freelyfloating rate could have damaging effects on import prices - and  hence thesocial contract and domestic inflation.3, To control the  rate, we need more reserves.     Hence we have no alternative but to  proceed with our application to  the IMF and  get all thesupport we can.     We could not introduce QRs now.    To do so would make itimpossible to continue with the applications for the further tranches of IMFborrowing.    Without the knowledge that IMF support is in prospect, and thatour policies would be agreed with the IMF, confidence would collapse and weshould be faced with an uncontrollable slide in sterling.    We have therefore no alternative but to continue with present policies for some months.Q SECRET )
!      -^i\tz sv------stCould we introduce QRs later on?4. Whenever they are introduced, QRs take time to bite.     They will0!1produce very significant effects for the first six months or so, and wouldanother six to nine months to achieve their full effects.    In the meantimewho would lend us money to  finance the deficit?    Certainly not our EECpartners, or the  United States, who would regard the imposition of QR* *a gross infringement of our international obligations.    Certainly not the B&apos;?who may very well only release our remaining credits by instalments.Again, we should be unable to support the rate while QRs take time to bit6&apos; J5. Holders of sterling (on both official and  private account) would       1expect (probably rightly) that any QR regime would have to be reinforced Wpmuch tighter exchange control on both official and private transactions.They would take the first opportunity to try and get out of sterling, henceexacerbating the pressures on the rate.of)6. The  protectionist Btrategy can only work behind a tight ring fencecontrols on imports of goods and foreign exchange transactions - both c&amp;P^t-and current.    In the likely circumstances of 1976 or 1977, are we sure th^1can get all the fences up fast enough to prevent a collapse of sterling?    ^ Mthe QR option, whether implemented now or later on, would never get off&quot;ground.The EEC7. The legal position is that introduction of QRs is contrary to community Law: and, under the Treaties, Community Law overrides   .United Kingdom Law.    It is doubtful whether we could repeal the relevantsections of the Treaty of Accession, in order to legalise our position, an**the same time remain a member of the e.c..
8. More important is the political impact.    QRs are so contrary to the basic principles of the Community that we should be under every kind ofpolitical and economic pressure to change our minds, including, mostimmediately, refusal to help with, our foreign exchange difficulties.Retaliation and Emulation9. Whatever the precise- form of e.c. reaction, we would certainly be exposed to retaliation by other countries, under the provisions of the GATT.It seems  inconceivable that, under pressure from their industrialists, the        JUSA and Japan would not use the threat of legal retaliation under GATT to try  (*to force us to change our minds.    If they did not succeed other countries inweak balance of payments situations - Ireland and Denmark, for instance -would tend to follow our example and impose QRs themselves.     This wouldbe bad for our exports and it is by no means certain that we would be betteroff at the end of the day with QRs than without them.    And we would earn theinternational odium of having started a trade war.Our place in the Atlantic Community10.        The whole philosophy behind our international policies - both political and economic - has been based on the assumption that our future lies in membership of the Atlantic Community.    This takes the form of membership of the e.c. and the free trade and political co-operation which that implies;  co-operation in trade and payments policies in OECD;  and a major commitment to NATO.    A decision to introduce QRs implies going back on this whole philosophy.    It would be damaging to the e.c., damaging to international co-operation in trade and.payments policy, and damaging to NATO.    Once this damage had been done, it would be extremely difficult tore-establish ourselves in the Atlantic Community,    Our  former partnerswould be reluctant to trust so unreliable an ally again, and we would be liable to find ourselves left economically protectionist, and politicallyisolated.[: SECRET
r*w I tL.10II - THE INDUSTRIAL AND ECONOMIC CASEU. The  protectionist strategy assumes  that QRs can be imposedwithout interfering very much  with the smooth flow of industrial component&quot;and that manufacturing output could! rise rapidJy and without dislocation,practice, this assumption is most unlikely to be fulfilled in practice.12.        International trade in manufactures is now so complicated andspecialised that any quota scheme will be seriously disruptive.    Multi-nationals make components in one country and assemble in another.    &quot;With1&quot;a single commodity group - eg bearings - we are ourselves an exportersome kind of bearings and an importer of others.    Any quota scheme is bound to run counter to this pattern of specialisation and will lead toshortages of individual components and spare parts, bottlenecks and hold-11^iin production.

And thereversal of the  process of international specialisation is likely to damaScan important source of increasing productivity in the longer term.otIndustrial Regeneration or Industrial Ossification*****,-eig1113.        British industry has failed to  compete effectively in export m-&amp;and failed to maintain its shares of domestic markets in the face of  orcompetition.    This failure to compete is not simply due to lack of invest- ^ment.    It has a whole variety of causes: price, poor marketing, infcri0*obsolete design, poor after-sales service, etc.    British industry can onlyreverse these weaknesses by facing up to the competition.    Protectionwould only succeed if industry organised itself to  develop new andinternationally competitive products and to launch new and major markedcampaigns to sell them.    There is no reason to think that protection - cin the  absence of retaliation - would  produce anything of the kind.    lr 1more likely that under protection, management and labour would be able tavoid the changes which are necessary to face up to their  competitors-Behind a wall of quotas they would become still more home-market on*&quot;   :and the home market would have ntf choice but&apos;to  accept whatever qua^-Vservice they offered.    When the QRs were eventually relaxed we vouWourselves still as ui^prrTpe^tjjfe as e ver^i
( secret )14.       Moreover, it is worth noting the views of industry itself.    Variousgroups have asked for selective import restrictions, to protect particular industries or products which were suffering special difficulties from foreigncompetition.    But industry is heavily against any measures of general importrestriction, and they are against them for the arguments set out above.    Theview that general import restrictions would be more likely to produceindustrial ossification than regeneration is reinforced by tiie views of industry itself.Taxes and Public Expenditure15.       The case for the alternative strategy argues (EY(76) 49,paragraphs 29-31) that, while tax increases or public expenditure cuts may benecessary with QRs, the probability is that fiscal policy will be somewhat less difficult with QRs than under the present strategy.16.       This view rests on the major assumption that there would be a rapid increase in output under protection, which would result in higher tax receipts,and reductions in expenditure or unemployment and other social security benefits, and less assistance to industry in difficulties.  Given the  short-rundislocation which QRs are likely to cause to industrial production, and the doubts about the incentive to modernise and expand in the longer term, this assumption will almost certainly prove optimistic.    If output does not rise as fast as the alternative strategy assumes, then there will be excess domestic demand, which will suck back potential exports on to the home market, and     jtax increases or public expenditure cuts on a substantial scale will proveunavoidable.Will the consumer accept the implications?17.       The restrictions would fall most heavily on imports of consumerdurables and would have to last for several years.    Unless and until british manufacturers set up new production lines, there would be at least only veryrestricted supplies of a wide range of consumer goods includingf^ECRE^
( secret&quot;)refrigerators, washing machines, motorcycles, colour television.    Ratand *hi-fi equipment would be limited to the more expensive and inferiorBritish products.    If motorcar exports are not to be frustrated by highdomestic demand, restrictions on the  supply of cars to the home marketalmost certainly be necessary.    The forced changes in consumption, and physical shortages resulting from QRs, would be unacceptable to consume18.       There is, moreover, a prospect of widespread price inflation -would be difficult to control - black markets, profiteering, hoarding, briland evasion.QRs cannot provide a basis for confidence19.       Finally, and perhaps most important, there is a political factor totaken into account.20.      If a scheme of QRs is to provide a basis for the regeneration ofindustry, it would have to be kept on for about five years in order to giveindustry time to carry out the necessary reorganisation and new investmeThey will need to have an assurance of five years&apos; protection if they are to plan ahead with any confidence.   Even if we used QRs to get the balance ofpayments back into balance, we would need to be prepared to keep them on for three years.21. In fact, the Government can give no such assurance. In practice,everyone knows, the most it can do is to guarantee to keep them on for the lifetime of the present Parliament - and that is not long enough to createconfidence required. Indeed a statement by the Opposition that it intendeddismantle the scheme as soon as it took office would be sufficient to nullifyany confidence effects. Given the uncertainties, firms will sit tight, andno risks.
