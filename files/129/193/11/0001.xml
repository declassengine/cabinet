DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(76)121 COPY NO      gl30 November 1976CABINETSOCIA.L SECURITY BENEFITS, PUBLIC SERVICE PENSIONSAND TAXATIONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer, I should like to indicate briefly why. quite apart from theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), there are powerful reasons why weshould now review the existing arrangements for uprating social security benefits and public service pensions.2.        At present we are committed by the existing legislation to upratesocial security benefits at least once a year and to raise pensions andother long-term benefits in line with earnings (or with prices if they risefaster) and the main short-term benefits in line with prices.   As a result,at the time of the last Budget, we had to decide on an uprating which,because of the administrative time-lags involved, has come into effectonly this month, and adds approximately  l  billion to this expenditure,raising it to a total level of over  11 billion a year.   As matters stand,at around the time of the next Budget we will be compelled by law to takea similar decision entailing an even greater injection of purchasing powerinto the economy.    Unless we secure some discretion about theseupratings, a number of existing problems will rsmain with us and arelikely to become progressively more acute.CONTROL OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURE3.        Social security accounts for over one-fifth (in fact about 22 per cent)of all public expenditure.    Most of this is at present removed from thescope of our decisions on public expenditure so that any reductions mustfall all the more heavily on the remaining programmes.1
HIGH LEVELS OF INCOME TAX4.        The large sums required for uprating benefits under the presentlegislation will have to be found out of taxable capacity and reduce thescope for reductions in the income tax burden.    Yet there 1b growingevidence that the level of income tax has become a real obstacle toimproved industrial performance at all levels, particularly at the top andbottom of the earnings ladder.AN INCREASE IN OVERLAP BETWEEN THE INCOME OF THOSE ONBENEFIT AND THOSE AT WORK5.        The standard of living of those on benefit has been improved, insome cases very substantially, at a time when the real wages of those in work has been squeezed and are likely to fall severely in the period ahead.For example, in the period since the last Tory uprating in 1973 whenaverage real take-home pay per employee rose only 1 per cent (and fellfor anyone on average gross earnings), both married and single pensionsincreased by 15 per cent in real terms; and pensions and short term benefits, including unemployment benefit, have improved substantiallyas a percentage of net average earnings.    (46 per cent compared with37^ per cent for a married pensioner couple; and 50 per cent compared,with 46 per cent for a couple with two children on flat rate unemploymentbenefit).    There has been a compelling case for improving the relative position of those on benefit compared with what it was in 1973.    But tocontinue that relative improvement indefinitely will worsen the problemof incentives which ic already severe.    Many on benefit are better offthan they would be at work and to earn substantially more in work than inbenefit requires a relatively high gross income.    (See paragraph 8 below).PUBLIC SERVICE PENSIONS6.        So long as social security pensions and other benefits are inflationproofed, it is difficult to make a case against inflation-proofing publicservice pensions.7.        This does not mean that we should go to the opposite extreme andfreeze benefits or cancel the next uprating.   But there is clearly a case for amending the existing provisions, or legislating to put them in suspensefor a stated period, in such a way as to give us a degree of discretion touprate with regard to the economic situation and what we can afford.The adjustments to be made need not be the same for both short-term benefits and for pensions, but it is only if we secure some room for manoeuvre on pensions (which, with other long-term benefits account for over half of the social security bill) that we could in equity amend orsuspend the Pensions (Increase) Act also so as to have a similardiscretion about public service pensions, including but by no meansconfined to those of retired civil servants.2
8.        The case is particularly strong for tackling the problem of theoverlap between wages and benefits.    For example, to get  5 more in work than out of work a married man needs to earn more than  65 grossa week if he has two children, and more than   70 a week if he has fourchildren.    Even  5, of course, is hardly a strong work incentive.Thus family men need to get very nearly average earnings to give thema worthwhile advantage over what they would get when out of work.Some 45 per cent of married men with two children in 1975 were on average earnings or less.    If present uprating policy continues in 1977,this situation can only get worse.    Besides the disincentive effect of thisoverlap, it is fuelling a backlash among the low paid against the wholeconcept of the welfare state and creates the impression that people onbenefit are in some sense &quot;scroungers&quot;.    The social and political implications of this backlash are a real cause for concern - not least asit affects the immigrant population.9.        In principle this problem can be tackled by raising tax thresholdsor introducing tax on short term benefits or a combination of the two.    Iwould certainly wish to include the raising of tax thresholds in mypreferred solution to this complex of issues.    But this will be possibleonly if we succeed in reducing total public expenditure and the totalrequirement from direct taxation.   As regards taxing short term benefits, there are arguments in principle in favour of this course andit could potentially produce considerable tax revenue.    For instance,there would be a yield of up to  150 million a year from taxing sickness benefit if that proved possible.    But, whether or not these arguments onthe merits of the case were accepted, there are first immense practical problems to be overcome.    We have already said that we are lookingagain at this, but that it has been examined more than once under previousGovernments when the administrative difficulties were found to be verygreat.    Officials are now looking at the problem again but, even if theadministrative difficulties could be overcome, there could not be any yield from this source before 1979-80,    Taxation of short term benefits could therefore be no substitute for early action on the levels of benefits.CONCLUSION10.       For these reasons there would in any case be strong grounds for seeking powers to give us an element of discretion over the next upratingsof social security benefits and public service pensions.    The need toconsider this would arise irrespective of the negotiations with theInternational Monetary Fund, but because of these negotiations this is an option which we must now bring into the reckoning as a matter of urgency.I understand very well the difficulties involved in tackling this problem butwe will also be in considerable difficulty, political and social as well as financial, if we fail to tackle it,D W treasury Chambers30 November 19763
