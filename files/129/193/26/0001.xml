THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAjESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSOCIAL SECURITY (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) bill memorandum by the Secretary of State forthe Home department.      As invited by the Cabinet at their meeting on 9 December(CM(76) 40th Conclusions, Minute 1), the Home and Social Affairs (HS)Committee today considered the handling of the Committee Stage of theSocial Security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.2.      The two most contentious provisions in the Bill are Clause 4, whichrestricts occupational pensioners&apos; unemployment benefit, the Clause 13which withdraws students1 access to Supplementary Benefit in the shortvacations.    The Standing Committee on the Bill had its first meeting on tuesday 14 December.    Government backbenchers on the StandingCommittee include Mr George Cunningham, who has declared hisopposition to Clauoe 4 but did not vote against the Bill at Second Reading.Conservative and Liberal Members on the Standing Committee will beunited in opposing the Clause.    Clause 4 is expected to be reached on tuesday 21 December; Clause 13 seems nnlikely to be reached before themiddle of January at the earliest.CLAUSE 43.      The decision to restrict payment of unemployment benefit tooccupational pensioners was taken and announced as part of the Julypackage.    On the basis of the present provision, savings would be 9 million in 1977-78 and  14 million in a full year.    In the light of theSecond Reading Debase, HS Committee considered two possible concessions:a. To raise from  25 to  30 the weekly level of occupational pensions above which unemployment benefit begins to be reduced.This would exempt some 3, 000 out of the 16, 000 or so occupational pensioners who would be affected at the present  25 level.    Itwould reduce the full year saving by  3 million,b. To make the provision a temporary one, by allowing it tolapse automatically or making it subject to renewal by affirmative resolution after a period of some years.CP(76) 136COPY NO15 December 1976CABINET1
4.      The Committee were unable to reach any clear view on whether these concessions would carry the provision through Committee Stage or whether,oven if they succeeded in that, the provision would then survive report stage.    The attitude of those who oppose the principle of the provision maybe altered by the consultations with the Post Office Engineering Union, the confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress which have still to be completed and by the Chancellor of the Exchequers statement onthe IMF negotiations.    So far as the Committee Stage is concerned, a gooddeal may also hinge on the responsiveness cr otherwise of Mr  GeorgeCunningham to the concession proposed at a. above.5.      In the circumstances the Committee felt that it would be reasonable to give the Secretary of State for Social Services and the Minister of social security discretion, in the light of their continuing consultations -i.    to raise the weekly limit from  25 to  30 either by Governmentamendment or by accepting an amendment from Mr Cunningham if he agreed to put it down;ii,    to offer, but only as a toot resort in the Committee Stage itself,the concession of making the provision temporary (thus preserving the principle of the National Insurance benefit).6.      The Committee did not consider that if the first of these concessionsseemed likely to fail, there would be any point in raising the proposed limit to  35 (which would reduce the full year&apos;s savings from  14 million to 9 million),CLAUSE 137.       This Clause, when conj oined with regulations to abolish studentaccess to unemployment benefit in the short vacations, would secure savings of some  13 million a year.    The provisional view of the Secretary of Statefor Social Services and the Minister for Social Security is that some concession will be required at Committee Stage.    But since this will not bereached until mid-January at the earliest and further consultations arerequired with the Department of Education and Science, the supplementary benefits Commission and other Departments concerned, HS committee agreed to defer their consideration of possible concessions until an early meeting after the Recess.M RHomo Office15 December 1976 j2 I
