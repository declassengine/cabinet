(confidential)THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTEY(76)59 copy NQ .11 November 1976CABINETMINISTERIAL COMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC STRATEGYEXPORT CREDIT policy note by the Chancellor of the ExchequerMedium and long-term export credit is now presenting acute problems over a range ^1of policy fronts.   The issues are examined in detail in the annex to this paper.*In brief, we are effectively lending very large amounts overseas, at heavily subsided rates of interest, while having ourselves to borrow to finance our .balance of payments deficits - and to repay the amounts so borrowed.   On present policies we are likely to be lending the overseas buyers of the exports concernedsome  2 billion in 1977-78 and increasing amounts thereafter.   Because theGovernment refinances a major part of the increases in net export credit advanced by the banks, the result is a very large, uncontrolled and unpredictable claim on public expenditure, and consequently on the PSBR.   Problems are also created for monetary policy given the existence of specific targets for both the PSBR and money supply.SS.     I have secured some alleviation of the latter problems, for 1977-78, bypersuading the clearing banks to revise the refinancing formula.   This will mean that the refinancing which the Government has to do will be about  200 million less than it otherwise would be, in that year only.   Nevertheless, the latestforecasts suggest that expenditure on refinancing will still amount to almostand nearly  670m in 1978-79. 500 million in 1977-78/   This implies    &quot; additional bids of nearly  150 million in each of these years, an unacceptable situation when significant reductions arebeing made in other areas of public expenditure.   It is unrealistic to suppose that the banks would agree to, shoulder all this additional burden.   Even if theywould, shifts in the internal financing of export credit do not get to the rootof the problem.   The basic problem is that because almost all our export creditis at present financed in sterling, we are lending abroad on a massive scale,often to customers in countries whose currencies and balance of payments are much stronger than our own;   and especially in circumstances of sterling depreciation,the consequence is a free gift of part of the value of our exports to overseasbuyers.confidential

This cost could riseto  400 Billion or more in 1978-79* if the subsidy continues to be iothe region of      per annum.   These costs represent additional burden&apos;on the PSBR.   Thus by 1978-79 the total impact on the PSBE of bothexpenditure on refinancing and the cost of the interest rate subsidycould well exceed  1,000 million.4-.     Ve need to take urgent steps to change this situation.   Ky propo*is that we should provide substantial incentives for exporters to ma**use of foreign currency financing rather than sterling credit.   Forthis purpose the key requirement is to increase the rates of interestcharged for guaranteed sterling finance.   My proposal is that therates should be increased by a minimum of 2% across the board to giv*a new mininua of $i%  This increase in nominal interest rates will still maintain sterling export credit interest rates at their reallevel of two years ago: in this sense the increase would only be a partial reversal of the unintended increqse in the subsidy that hasrecently taken place.5.     In order to encourage the use pf foreign currency finance, I woU^propose that those exporters who do so should be allowed to quoteinterest rates at the minimum level compatible with international agreements: in some cases this would mean in practice a lower, rateof interest than under present arrangements.   Officials are alsourgently examining other ways of making the use of foreign currencyfinancing more attractive to exporters, eg ways of enabling them toincrease their sterling profits by selling forward prospective foreign currency receipts.   A switch to foreign currency financing would inevitably create the need to re-examine practices currently geared t0the use of sterling financing and sterling invoicing.6.    A switch to foreign currency financing will have substantial2

There is similarly a direct benefit to public expenditure since there would be no question of having to^finance export credit financed in foreign currency.

In present circumstances*ne present open ended arrangements for refinancing abd subsidising^erling export credit impose too great a burden on the PSBfi.3
10.   I therefore recommend the following measures:-a. An increase in the minimum fixed rate of interest on sterlingexport credit of at least 2% for all classes of business on these terms, with the possible but only exception of shipbuilding becauseof its long recognised special treatment for these purposes.b. A more rigorous approach in considering those cases where ECGDare unable to support a transaction on a commercial basis but do so&quot;in the national interest&quot;, and also the adoption of tougher limits on the amount of credit we are prepared to extend to individualmarkets - in several cases there is already mounting anxiety aboutthe ability of the countries in question to repay the accumulatingdebts.c. No increase to be made in the present minimum fixed rates ofinterest when the credit is financed in foreign currency - ie the dollar or possibly the Deutschmarfc - with the lowest possible ratesbeing charged in these cases and ECGD to make no extra charge wheninsuring such contracts.D W HHM Treasury11 November 1976
ANNEXEXPORT CHEDITIntroductionMedium and long term export credit is now presenting acute problems over a range of policy fronts.   The amount of overseas lending involved creates a very largecharge on the balance of payments capital account.   Because the Governmentrefinances a major part of export credit advanced by the banks there is anuncontrolled and unpredictable claim on public expenditure, and consequently onthe PSHR.   Current ;problems also arise for monetary policy.   And finally theallocation of national resources is being distorted by selling goods abroad to foreigners at prices below the value we put on the use of the same resources athome.   This note sets out these problems in more detail and makes specific recommendations designed to curb the extension of fixed rate sterling credit and topromote the financing of such credit in foreign currency.background.     The UK, in common with most other industrialised countries, provides credit atfixed rates of interest for those exports which are sold on repayment terms of twoyears or longer.   The credit terms vary from contract to contract, subject since junly 1976 to internationally agreed guidelines on minimum interest rates and maximumcredit lengths for different categories of markets.   In 1975-76 the rate of interestof most contracts fell within the range of 7% to SJilS.   The length of credit varies^..between 2 and 10 years or even longer on occasions.   Exports sold on these termsare mainly the larger capital goods and they represent about 8% or less of the total value of UK exports.3.    For this class of exports we are therefore providing a big effective subsidysince the cost of obtaining such credit on commercial terms in the domestic market would be in the region of 15* or more.   The implicit subsidy on these credits riseswith the length of credit, but on a credit length of eight years (a not unusualperiod in a buyer credit case) the effective subsidy is of the order of 25-;50*.For all business on fixed interest terms, the average subsidy amounts to some 15*to 20*.   The subsidy element is even higher if   a   Test Discount Rate in real terms is used instead of the monetary cost of government borrowing.   This subsidy
is far greater than was envisaged four years ago, when the present fixed ratescheme was introduced, as a result of UK domestic interest rates rising to and remaining at higher levels than those in other major exporting countries.    (most other countriee provide a subsidy in some form - except Germany - but the effective subsidy is much less than the UK because of our higher domestic interest rates).The Balance of Payments problemif.    Export credit represents an outflow of capital abroad.   These outflows, inaddition to our continuing current account deficits, are a major factor in our external borrowing requirements.   It is now clear that even on the moat optimisticassumptions about our borrowing prospects there is going to be a critical probl** :in raising external finance over the period ahead.5.    We are lending very large sums overseas the repayment of which is deferred 0*long periods whereas our overriding need is for foreign exchange now and in theimmediate future.   It is particularly inappropriate for the UK to be offering sue&amp;large sums - involving gross advances which are likely to reach some  2 billionnext year - over a period when we are seeking to borrow and repay comparable su**abroad.   Repayments due on the longer term credits will be making no contributionto meeting the repayments due on our own, shorter term borrowings.   Moreover, outborrowings will have to be repaid in &quot;hard&quot; currencies, whereas the repayments ofthese export credits are at the moment in depreciating sterling.   Figures for tn*forecast increases in both gross and net fixed rate credit outstanding are given below.  million at current prices1976-77   1977-78   1978-79   1979-80   1980-811.

They assume that the share of exports covered bythis type of credit will decline from the present historically, high levels. Inpractice, if foreign importers respond to the increased real level of subsidiseinvolved, the share of exports covered might be expected to rise. M
jfrfr Public Expenditure problem and the PSBR6.    Under present arrangements, the clearing banks lend on demand to exportersif the business is insured by ECGD.   Because the scale of such lending is so large, the banks will not provide all the finance from their own resources.Inder an agreement between HMO and the banks, the latter carry on their ownbooks an amount of export credit lending equal to 18SK of their non-interestbearing sterling sight deposits (roughly speaking, their current account deposits)-.The balance is refinanced by ECGD.   This refinancing represents public expenditure and an addition to the Public Sector borrowing requirement.   This expenditure isimpossible to forecast with any precision since it depends on both the forecast for export values and a forecast of bank deposits and a snail error in either ofthese has a major impact on the estimate of refinancing.7.     Subject to these forecasting uncertainties, refinancing could give rise to asubstantial &quot;additional bid&quot; this year and a similar claim on the contingency reserve was in prospect for 1977-78.   For this reason the Chancellor of the^chequer saw Lord Armstrong and other representatives of the clearing banks inJuly with the result that the banks have agreed to raise the refinancing &quot;threshold&quot;in 1977 from l8jU to 2096.   Provided the banks agree to maintain the threshold atthis level, this increase will avoid much of the prospective increase in public expenditure in 1977-78.   Nevertheless, the latest forecasts suggest that there willbe substantial additional bids for expenditure on refinancing in every year of the survey period - at a time when the room for manoeuvre in holding public expenditure limits is virtually zero.EXPENDITURE ON REFINANCING EXPORT CREDITCm at 1976 Survey Prices1976-77 1977-78 1978-79 1979-80 1980-811- EstimatedRefinancing 5^7 **97.* 669.6 551.8 557-0Requirement2. &quot;Additionalbids&quot; implied 160      1V9.2      148.V       29-7       42.by 1.
7ft.   These figures represent expenditure on refinancing only.   They do not include the cost of subsidising the interest rates charged on these loans.   Thiscost   (broadly speaking, the difference between the fixed rate charged on theseexport credits and the government borrowing rate as a percentage of the netamounts of credit outstanding) imposes an additional burden on the PSBR.   although this cannot be forecast, since it depends on interest rate levels, it is likelyto amount to some  200 million this year.   If the subsidy continues at around8*pa, by 1978-79 this subsidy will be adding some &amp;00 million to the PSBR.7b.   Thus the total effect of the subsidy coat plus expenditure on refinancingbe to add some  1.000 million or more to the PSBR in 1978-79 and similar increasesthereafter.8-     If the problem were only one of reducing public expenditure on refinancingone obvious solution would be to try and induce the clearing banks to carry astill larger proportion of export credit without refinancing and to introduceother private sector lenders into the scheme - eg banks other than clearing banW*such as the Coop, some foreign banks, and insurance companies.   However, there is unlikely to be much scope for securing yet a further increase in the thresholdby the clearers, because there is a limit on prudential grounds to theproportion of their funds they are prepared to tie up in this form of medium and long term lending.   Thus any significant rise in the proportion of fundsallocated to export credit ia likely to be at the expense of other medium termlending.   More importantly, such shifts in source of financing from the public sector to the private sector do not help with the other problems and the monetary impact ia not relieved.Monetary Policj aspects9. The extension of export credit whether by the banks or by the Governmentadds to money supply and d.s.c. When the banks extend the credit, bank lendingis increased; when the Government extends the credit (through refinancing) it
the PSBR.   Both the PSBfl and the money supply have been subject, since July, to specific targets and it will continue to be necessary to maintain stringent targets in this area to preserve the UK*a credit worthiness.   The monetary consequences ofthe present growth of sterling export credit must therefore give cause for serious concern.   If export credit on the scale at present projected is to be providedwithin the constraint of a tight monetary target other demands for bank credit willhave to be cut back.   In present circumstances, with relatively low demand foradvances from &apos; non-essential&apos; borrowers a substantial part of any cut-back onlending would be likely to fall on other areas of UK industry.Resource allocation10.   Medium and long terra sterling export credit is currently being provided atrates of anything up to B% below the cost of market borrowing.   A subsidy of thepresent order must, over time, seriously distort the allocation of national resources.   We are selling goods to the foreigner at prices far below the value we put on the use of the same resources at home.   On domestic grounds such a policy could be justified only if the resources could be used in no other way except toproduce these particular exports.   On anything but an extremely short-terra view,it is difficult to believe that there are many cases that could satisfy this condition.   Moreover, both in theory and in practice the PSBR places severe restric-tions on subsidies to employ &quot;unusable&quot; resources.   An approximate measure of the realresource cost is 15* to 20% of the gross outflows (paragraph 3 and 5 above) amountingto  230-2310 million this year, rising to CaSOra to ShGOm in 1978-79.11.   In terms of objectives related to the overall balance of payments position,public expenditure control and monetary policy, and to the optimum use of resources,there are therefore strong arguments for reducing the rapidly growing amount of sterling credit being advanced.general Economic Strategy12.   However, the real costs of fixed rate export credit are not readily apparentto industry and the general public.   The Qovernmenfs strategy places greatreliance on export led growth.   Popular attention is focussed on the current accountof the balance of payments.   This reflects the value of exports as they leave thecountry, irrespective of when they are paid for.   The message to be got across isthat our strategy must be to increase those exports which bring a full and earlybenefit to the balance of payments.   (Well over 90* of our exports by value are soldon cash or short-term credit.)   We cannot afford to subsidise without   limit those
exports for which payment is delayed so far in to the future, paymont3 wi&apos;ir.:i areliable to be in depreciated sterling.Industrial Considerations13.   Fixed rate export credit is particularly important for specific areas of engineering industry - shipbuilding, process plant, electrical generating machinery!ordnance and small arms, &quot;miscellaneous machinery&quot; and aerospace, all of whichhave more than 10?$ of their output covered by the current scheme.   These ir.;luatrieSileaving aside ordnance and small arms-and possibly aerospace as special cacss, aregenerally working far below capacity at present with relatively poor prospects forrecovery.1^.   The Government is closely concerned with the future of all these industries,either directly (shipbuilding and aerospace), through planning agreementc (process which is now the subject of a CPRS Report)plant/ or through sector working parties who would regard a  substantial increase i&quot;the interest rate on export credits as contrary to the industrial strategy.15.   The theme of increasing export volume is central (along with importsubstitution) to the second round of the strategy, and it is also a main clementin the Government response to industries such as process plant which are facing a drop in UK (mainly public sector) orders.16.   Given the market conditions facing them, these sectors - many of whoso firwsare in development areas - may not be able to shorten the credit terms they   ofSf-twith ECGD help or to charge higher interest rates without losses of a substantial number of orders.Time Lag17.   A further complication is that any action to restrain the extension of cjvtlUwill takfii some considerable time to affect the balance of payments and public expenditure figures.   This is because there is a variable lag between the brv,^undertaking commitments to make advances and thoso advances actually bein^ (!v*twndown by exporters:   On very large contracts, when shipment is made in insLnljijeiitennd tho credit drawn down correspondingly, it can take several years for the cre-H1to be drawn down completely.   In general, E03D estimate that of commitment-;-6-
OOMTIDSKTIALundertaken now some will begin to be called within the first year and the bull; all be drawn by the end of the second year.   This does not fully represent the time-scale for the.effects of &quot;policy changes, however, because there will also bo aperiod preceding the commitment by a bank to provide finance during which the contract is being negotiated on the basis of current credit terms.   Because theproblem related to our balanoe of payments, public expenditure and monetary policyobjectives are going to remain aoute for the next three to four years, this meanswe have to take action urgently to achieve results within this time scale...Policy Options18.   As matters stand, priority is being given to the open-ended expansion of export&quot;credit with the result that we are faced with serious problems over the whole raneeof policy fronts as discussed above.   The scale of these problems means that wecannot afford to go on as we are and that some reatraint must be imposed on the prospective growth of subsidised export credit.   It Is not realistic to suppose thatwe could get significant help from an early nejrf international agreement on creditterms which would significantly tighten the recently agreed guidelines,   (seeparagraph 2).   This is partly because so little progress has been made over the past two years with each country being jealous of its national independence in this area(especially the French) and partly because such an agreement would only affectofficially supported credit and not bear on exporters who could raise financecommercially in those oountries with much lower interest rate structures than the UK.We clearly oould not expect other oountries to agree to higher fixed rates on export credit if this would mesa their charging rates higher than those prevailingon their domestic market.19.   In the absence of significant relief from international action we need toconsider domestic measures to restrain the growth of subsidised export crorfit.   V,mmoat draafcio course of action would be to eliminate the interest subsidy complete *by raising fixed rates of interest up -to the region of market levels.   Thin,however, would involve bo large an increase (of &amp; or so) as to involve aconsiderable risk to a wide rang, of capital goods so long as other exporting countries either continue to subsidise their rates or to enjoy much lower domesticinterest rates.   *&quot; &quot;* - *&apos; &apos;OONFIDSNTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL20.   We could impost.&apos; a ceiling on the amount of sterling credit we were prepared i:oapprove or refinance ie fix a limit to the amount of new business which i-&apos;CQD could,   , . a    M   J   is that this wouldguarantee in a particular period.   The danger/ in practico/involve first come firstserved treatment till the limit was reached, with arbitrary consequences for particular industries.   For example, if a tough annual limit were imposed, this could be reaohed within a matter of months and we would then face the choice of either turning away applications for the rest of the year (which may reprecentbusinoss on better terms than some of that already accepted) or immediatelybreaching the ceiling.   This course of action may have to be taken if no other canbe found, but it is not recommended at this-stage.. &quot;. .i-.53-21.   A third possibility is to change the basis of a refinancing schema with the banks so as to relieve them of the collective obligation to finance all the suitablebusiness which presents itself.   This by itself would do nothing to reduce thedemand for sterling credit in the short run since the volume of business financed bythe banks depends upon the number and type of projects which ECGD io prepared to guarantee.   Changes in bank/iiCGD relationships depend essentially upon arenegotiation of the fixed rate arrangements for the period after October 1977.22.   Various steps could and should be taken to tighten up the terms on which fixedrate export credit is provided.   There is always room for discretion about the criteria adopted for giving credit guarantees.   In present circumstances it wouldbe sensible to do such things as have stricter limits for those markets whore theprospects of the countries concerned meeting their repayment obligations are weakerthan others.   The percentage of cover offered for individual projects could insome cases be cut back.   And the encouragement to look for business could bereduced by cutting back the number of countries where active export prdmotiofi tak.-.-,place.25.   This policy would amount to setting clear limits to the amount of bnr.li.irvjwhich can be accepted in particular markets, and in   some cases would mcn,i notaccepting any further business beyond the present allocation.   The adventa,;o of tVusapproach is that it can be explained in clear torras to exporters and ovcrac-ocustomers and it is sensible because there axe already anxieties about thestanding of a number of raarkots.   In order to bo effeotive, however, this approach&apos;    -8-COKFIDENTIAL
would need to be accepted by all the Departments concerned, in order to a-&apos;old thepresent tendency to undermine market limits by pleading special cases wheneverthese limits are retched.2k.   By themselves, howijyor, these changes cannot be relied upon to achieve asufficient impact on the growth of credit nor will they provide any inducement toexporters and their overseas buyers to arrange- sources of finance other thansterling (see para 28-51 below). Some increase in       4tho minimum&apos; interest rates on sterling export credit is now needed.   Theunavoidable problem in that we cannot quantify with any precision the size ofinterest rate increase which could be secured without unacceptable   damage tocertain industries bocausc of the lose of orders which might result and the limitedscope for the firms concerned to diversify into exporting on cash or non-subsidisedterms antf into import substitution.   However come increase in interest rates is now necessary to curb the demand for sterling credit.Foreign Currency Financing .25.   Many of the problems associated with fixed rate export credit would b*j reduced if Buch credit were financed in foreign currency.   This would bring an earlybenefit to the balmice of payments as exporters draw down foreign currency loan&apos;;.The size of subsidy needed to enable fixed rates to be charged to overseas buyerswould be substantially reduced since Eurocurrency borrowing rates arc so for belowUK domestic interest rates.   Public expenditure on refinancing would be reduceilsince foreign currency loans would not bo automatically refinanced - though scontingent refinancing liability would arise if ever the foreign currency loanscould not be renewed,   Moreover, exporters would bo able to sell forward their lorn,drawings (or progress payments) and thus obtain additional sterling, for so Ion,: n...sterling stands at a discount in the forward market, which can either bo taken asprofit or used to make their prices more competitive.26.   Although only rough estimates can be mnAo of the amount of funds which witjhfcbe available from tha Euro markets, market condiiions for such borrowing to finance export credit at the moment *uid in the near future seem favourable.   a proportion of this borrowing could be expected to be additional to the ex Ulan,;programme of UK borrc--:iu  since although it would be UK guaranteed the repayments-9-CORPIDKNTXAL

But with duereservation for the lwc? uncertainties involved, and assuming that sufficientinducement can be found, it would seem reasonable to envisage total borrowingthrough this channel of perhaps  1 billion in a full year.   The extent to which suchborrowing would be additional to thb ongoing programme of foreign currency borrowingby public sector bodies is still nore difficult to estimate, but it seems reasonable to expect that a quarter or perhaps as much as a half might be additional.   And both the amount potentially available and the degree ofadditionally wight be expected to improve over time aa the form of finance beaniefirmly established and recognised.27-   It is also impossible to estimate the demand for ouch foreign currency finance.Until now, there have been no cases of such financing of fixed rate credittransactions of which we are aware.   In part this has been due to the absence of miyarrangements for enabling a fixed rate of interest to be charged on such credit tv*dbecause ECGCs guarantee against default by the buyer did not afford fullprotection in the event of exchange rate changer: after the guarantee wok issuedsince claims were valued on        basis of the exchange rate ruling at the time theguarantee was signed.   ttXto are now introducing new arrangements to itmkrforeign currency financing a much more realistic option - these include jh-oU-ctin,;the exporter of his bank again at exchange rate changes in tha event of a buyerdefaulting and also the provision of ouch intertut rate adjustments as i,t*.y b-:-necessary to enable the exporter to quote an interest rate on a foreijn;, oi.rrc.icycontract comparable to that on d sterling contract Cat the present nu^ndLnoclrates).

28.   There are bound to be practical problems, only some of which can be indentified in the absence of any experience with foreign currency financing, that will have tobe dealt with as they arise and because some buyers may be reluctant to acceptarrangements entailing quotations in currencies harder than sterling.   The changeswe have already made, if coupled with an increase in the fixed rates on sterlingcredit, should produce a reasonably strong incentive to foreign currencyfinancing.New steps to assist exporters with foreign currency financing. &apos;29.   However in order to provide further positive assistance to exporters - manyof whom will be unfamiliar with foreign currency financing - the following measures could be considered when credits are financed in foreign currency:a. ECGD to stipulate the lowest interest rates possible under international guidelines.   This would mean that in a number of casesexporters could charge rates lower than the present rates which ECGDwould require for certain markets.b. If an exporter who is using a buyer credit facility financed bya-foreign currency loan wishes to sell forward his loan drawings overa longer period than the market can accommodate, the authorities couldif necessary make such forward purchases at market related rates.c. If exporters face additional costs or risks because of the need to know such forward prices at the time they are tendering - whereas the prices may have changed by the time they win the contract - ECGDcould consider whether ways could be found to alleviate this risk.d. The cost of insuring foreign currency financed contracts wouldhave carried an extra premium in addition to B00Dr8 basic insurancecharge.   Arrangements could be made so that this extra cost wasabsorbed in  000&apos;s overall premium structure.Consequences ^      increa*** in sterling interest rates50,   In principle, an increase in the rate of interest charged on export credit is equivalent to an increase in the overall;prices of those exports sold on such credit.
The amount of business which might be lost as a result of any given increasetherefore depends on how sensitive the demand for these exports is to price -the price elasticity of demand.     In order to justify a subsidy of the presentsize, the elasticity would need to be much highertoan that of 2% which is normallytaken to characterise the demand for exported manufactured goods generally.The Department of Industry believe that because of intense international competitionamong exporting countries, most of whom subsidise their export credit interest rates to some degree, the elasticity in respect of these particular exports maybe much higher than 2^.     If it were twice as high - 5 - and if there were no possibility of foreign currency financing, then DOI tentatively estimate thatan increase of 3% in interest rates might result in an overall loss of about 1/5in value terms of the exports sold on medium and long term export credit.     SincetheBe goods account for 8* or less of the total value of UK exports this would imply a loss equal to about l * or less of the total of UK exports.31.     However, there are obvious grounds for concluding that this calculation,based on pessimistic assumptions, may considerably overstate the loss of orders.If the elasticity were this high, or even higher, then we would have expected tosee a surge in demand for these UK exports, as a result of the recent sustaineddepreciation of sterling, of an order which does not seem to have materialised sofar.    Moreover, these calculations may overstate the risk to reports for two further reasons.    First, non-price factors such as technology and reliability,etc can be equally important in determining whether an exporter wins a contract.Secondly, and most important in the present context, we are proposing an increasein sterling interest rates but not for rates charged on credit financed in foreign currency.    Thus, the risk to business will depend less on the strict question of price sensitivity but more on toe extent to which exporters can arrange foreign currency loans and the extent to which buyers are prepared to accept such loanswhich involve their repaying in a currency harder than sterling.    There is some evidence that buyers, particularly in COHECON had OPEC markets, are more concernedwith nominal interest rates than with the currency of the loan.     In these cases,therefore, the UK exporter would be no less competitive than he is now if he could arrange foreign currency financing.    Thirdly, this increase in nominal interest rates will still not restore sterling export credit interest rates to their reallevel of two years ago - in this sense the increase is only the partial reversal ofthe unintended increase in the subsidy that has recently taken place.- 12 -CONFIDENTIAL
Conclusions and Recommendations32.    The problems posed by export credit are now so acute that we cannot afford togo on as we are in subsidising the open-ended growth of export credit.    Actton istherefore required to curb the growth of sterling credit and to secure a substantialshift into foreign currency financing.    Because of the time lags involved(para 17 above) such  action needs to be decided as soon as possible.33.    The following measures are recommended to achieve these objectives!- *a. a substantial increase in the minimum fixed rates of interest on allsterling credit over 2 years to apply to all export business with the possible exception of ships which have always been treated separately both domesticallyand internationally.    Any further exemptions would seriously undermine the effect of the increase.    There is a strong case for increasing interest rates by around 3-^i which would reflect the discount on sterling in the forward currency market.    At the very least, an increase of not less than2% is required.b. no increase in fixed rates on credit financed in foreign currency andsuch rates to be set at the minimum possible internationally so that the nominal rates would be lower than those now charged in some cases.c. further positive steps to assist foreign currency financing as outlined in paragraph 29 above.d. agreement on firm limits in the amount of credit we are prepared toextend to particular markets.CONFIDENTIALH H Treasury11 November 1976
