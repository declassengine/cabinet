I   The devolution background. The Government have just published a BUH.1) to give effect to their devolutionproposals for Scotland and Wales. The Bill provides for the creation of newbodies which will be directly elected by and answerable to people in Scotlandand Wales.2. The proposals for Scotland and Wales are complex. The Government havealready been working on them for over two years. They will now be closelyscrutinised by Parliament over a period of several months.3. The Government have always intended that their review of governmentarrangements in Great Britain should cover England also. But consultationsundertaken in the summer of 1974 showed not only much greater desire forchange in Scotland and Wales than in England but also a clearer view as to what form such change should take.4. The Government announced their preliminary conclusions for Scotland andWales in September 1974(a) but made it clear that it would be premature toreach any conclusions about change in England until further consultations hadbeen carried out. They decided subsequently to defer these further consultationsuntil they could be conducted against a background of firm proposals forScotland and Wales.5. The purpose of the present document is to describe very briefly the main features of the proposals for Scotland and Wales, to discuss the main implications-tions of these proposals for England and to set out the factors to be taken intoaccount in assessing the case for and against various possible changes in England.6. Constitutional arrangement in the United Kingdom have developed overthe years in a flexible way. Northern Ireland had a separate Parliament from1920 to 1973. Scotland has had its own Minister in the Government for manyyears with an increasing range of functions administered under his direction by officials operating from Edinburgh and working in close contact with represent-ative Scottish bodies. Wales has had a similar though newer and less extensivesystem. English arrangements have been different again, with a series of specialist Ministers directing functional departments, some of which haveregional offices maintaining contact with the interests concerned with a particularfunction in different parts of the country. The Scotland and Wales Bill does notrelate in any way to the system of administration in England and leaves theexisting arrangements untouched.7. This variety of constitutional arrangements has contributed to the flexibilityand responsiveness of government since it has been possible to devise machinerysuited to the requirements of a particular function in a particular part of theUnited Kingdom at a particular time, without having to apply identical arrange-ments everywhere. Requirements will continue to vary after devolution. TheGovernment see great advantage in avoiding the harmful effects of unnecessarystandardisation.(i) The Scotland and Wales Bill, published on 30 November 1976.(&apos;) Democracy and Devolution: Proposals for Scotland and Wales: Cmnd. 5732.
8. At this stage the Government do not themselves advocate any specificcourse of action in England. The factors affecting England arc singularlycomplex. It is important that they should be generally understood so that public discussion can be informed and illuminating. In the light of such discussion andany consensus which may result as to desirable change the Government will decide what proposals, if any, they ought to promote.9. Subsequent sections of this document deal with the constitutional impli-cations for England of the proposals for Scotland and Wales; their industrial and economic implications; the possibilities for change in England; and the factors which have to be weighed in assessing such possibilities. The final seciiondeals with the consultative process and contains a list of questions on whichviews are invited.II   England after devolution to Scotland and Wales:constitutional implications10. The English dimension of devolution has to be judged against the back-ground not only of the continuing supreme authority of Parliament but also ofthe form of the Governmenfs proposals for Scotland and Wales. It is clear,however, from comments made on the Governmenfs devolution policy thatwidespread misunderstanding still exists about its purposes and effects. before considering the constitutional implications for England, therefore, this sectionbriefly recapitulates the main features of the devolution policy.11. The Government see devolution to Scotland and Wales as a means of enabling the domestic affairs of these two parts of the United Kingdom, withtheir distinctive national traditions, to be administered in closer accordancewith the wishes of the people living there. Many of these matters are alreadyadministered by the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales. Devolution willcomplement this administrative decentralisation with separate political account-ability direct to the Scottish and Welsh electorates and will also reduce thepresent pressures on parliamentary time. The Government believe that the unified structure of the United Kingdom can accommodate these new institutions.12. In devising their devolution schemes the Government have sought to identify the areas of activity where decisions affect primarily people living inScotland or Wales. They consider it important not to devolve to either Assemblypowers over activities which substantially affect people living elsewhere or thewell-being of the United Kingdom generally.13. In relation to the matters to be devolved the new administrations willinherit the executive powers that Ministers now exercise. In addition, havingregard to the separate system of law in Scotland and the existence of separateinstitutions and policies in many of the activity areas concerned, the scottish assembly will have powers to legislate on most of the devolved matters.
14. Devolution will not, however, affect the supreme authority of parliament and its ability to make taws on any subject for the whole of the United kingdom or any part of it. Apart from this the Government and Parliament will continueto be directly concerned with a wide range of important matters in Scotlandand Wales for example, general industrial and economic policies (discussed inSection III), social security, the major nationalised industries, the regulation ofcommerce, the preservation of law and order. The Government win also havea general power to intervene, subject to parliamentary approval, where action by a devolved administration, or a failure to act, threatens to prejudice an interest for which the Government and Parliament have retained responsibility.15. It might be argued that in the interests of equal treatment between Englandand Scotland there should be an English Assembly, separate from Parliament,for business (including legislation) corresponding with that to be devolved inScotland. The Government firmly believe, however, that establishing such an assembly for England could damage the structure of the United Kingdom inways which the creation of a Scottish Assembly would not.16. Thus, it would not be appropriate for Parliament to act both as the legis-lature for the United Kingdom as a whole and also as the domestic legislaturefor Wales and, for the present, Northern Ireland but not for England or Scotland.In practice, if an English Assembly were established. Parliament^ role wouldhave to be restricted to a limited range of matters. Four separate assemblieswould be required in the four countries of the United Kingdom, each with itsown Executive.17. This would amount in practice to a form of federation a system whichwas rejected by the Kilbrandon Commission(a). The Government believe thata federal system would not fit the essential character of the United Kingdom asa union of four distinctive national components of very different sizes; and thatit would not be compatible, in the particular circumstances of the UnitedKingdom, with the close economic unity required to meet national needs andpublic expectations of social parity. England contains almost 85 per cent of thepopulation with a correspondingly overwhelming proportion of resources.No existing federation contains a partner of anything like this preponderance.An English Assembly representing such a large population could hardly avoidbecoming a rival to Parliament, particularly if the two bodies were under thecontrol of opposing parties. And because the expenditure needs of the EnglishAssembly would represent such a large part of total programmes, particularlyawkward relationships would exist in relation to taxation, resource allocation,regional planning and comparable issues. These difficulties would affect therelationships between Parliament and the three other asemblies also.18. The setting up of an English Assembly on the lines proposed for scotland would, compared with the consequences of a Scottish Assembly, involve an enormous diminution of the role of Parliament and its Members. This might bereduced to industrial, economic and financial matters, defence and foreignaffairs. The role of central government would be similarly truncated, althoughreserve powers in the devolved fields would &quot;be needed to carry out our inter-national obligations and to deal with e.c. matters generally.19.  For these reasons, the establishment of an English Assembly would carry(*) Report of the Royal Commission on the Constitution 1969-73; Cmnd. 5460 and 5460-1.
grave risks to the continuing political and economic unity of the United King-dom,the preservation of which the Government have regarded as a firm principle which should govern any proposals for devolution.20. Some people have accordingly proposed a series of regional assembliesfor England. But if each of these were to be given legislative powers the cum-ulative constitutional and parliamentary effect would be similar to that whichwoujd result from a, single English Assembly. Moreover, setting up regional assemblies with legislative powers would mean that, the legislative framework for such matters as, education, health, housing, local government and land use would be largely determined at regional level, leading to possibly marked differen-ces over short&quot; distances within England. The Government therefore rule out from further consideration not only the creation of an English Assembly butalso a series of regional assemblies wkh legislative powers.21.  Other possible regional arrangements are considered in Sections IV and V.Ill   England after devolution to Scotland and Wales:industrial and economic implications22. Much public comment in England has been concerned with the industrial and economic implications of the Governments proposals for&quot; Scotland andWales. Fears have been expressed that devolution will lead to an accretionof powers and influence to the devolved adrninistrations of a kind likely to prejudice the interests of England and, more particularly, the less prosperousregions of England. These fears are, in fact, groundless.23. The devolution which is being proposed for Scotland and Wales relates to matters which primarily affect people living, in Scotland and Wales andwhich can be administered separately in either country without side-effects for those&quot; living In the rest of the United Kingdom. The Government have made clear(4) that their proposals are designed not td infringe the economic unity of the United Kingdom. This economic unity has many.important aspects.They&apos;include not only external economic relations, the management of demand in the United Kingdom at a whole and the framework &apos;of trade, but also thetask of devising national policies to benefit particular parts of the UnitedKingdom and of distributing resources among them according to relative need.Regional pottdei24. , The main.purpose of regional policies is to promote investment andemployment.in-those parts of the wuntry which experience persistently above-average levels of unemployment. Such policies cannot be dealt within isolationfrom other national economic policies. They must be formulated andimplemented for Great Britain as a whole so that priorities can be judged fairlyafid the resources of the whole country deployed to help solve problems as(*) Part II of Our Changing Democracy: DevoJutkm to Scotland and Wilts: CnuuL 6348.
they arise anywhere within it. Accordingly the Government will continue afterdevolution to Scotland and Wales to determine in which parts of Great Britaineconomic conditions and prospects justify assisted area status and what formsof relief or incentive are to be available to established or incoming employers.And the Government will remain responsible for industrial developmentcertificate policy, which assists the steering of new industrial development tothe assisted areas.25. At present the three main regional incentives to industry are regional development Grants and Regional Selective Assistance (both of which areincentives to capital investment) and Regional Employment Premium.(whichassists with labour costs and is a continuing ajd available to established firms).In addition, much of the selective assistance provided under section 8 of theIndustry Act, for example under the Accelerated Projects Scheme and SpecialIndustry Schemes, on a national basis is in fact given to investment projects inthe assisted areas. All these systems of aid are administered by departments of central government; and responsibility for their administration will remain with central government after devolution to Scotland and Wales.26. But regional policies are concerned not only with the provision of regionalfinancial aids to employers but also with public investment designed to eliminatedeficiencies in the infrastructure and the amenities of the less prosperous areas.27. Infrastructure development is for the main part in the hands not of thecentral government itself but of local authorities and public corporations.However, the Government influence priorities, firstly in the settling of thepublic expenditure programmes for the various services and secondly inthe granting of capital expenditure authorisations or approvals to borrow.28. The Government will retain responsibility after devolution to Scotlandand Wales for a number of important forms of infrastructure which form partof a national network such as railways and ports. Other forms which are more closely related to local needs-for example, housing, roads, water supplyand sewerage-will come under the aegis of the devolved administrations but will normally be provided by local authorities or public corporations, in somecases with financial assistance from the block funds paid to the devolvedadministrations. Certain types of environmental improvement notablyredevelopment and clearance of derelict land may be carried out by the recently created Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies using resourcesput at their disposal by the devolved administrations from the wider, resourcesprovided for all devolved purposes.Finance29. The arrangements for financing devolved services were explained in theWhite Paper of November 1975(V-they have since been modified by thewithdrawal of the proposal for an optional surcharge on local rates(*).The essential feature is that there will be a block fund for each administration which will take account both of local needs and of the desirability of com-parability of standards in all parts of the United Kingdom. These funds will bevoted by Parliament. At the same tune a limit will be laid down for the totalamounts to be authorised by the devolved administrations for developmentsOur Changing Democracy: Devoratien to Scotland and Walw: Cmnd. 6348.Devolution to Scotland and Wales: Supplementary Statement: Cmnd. 65&amp;V&apos;
financed by long-term borrowing (eg most capital investment by localauthorities). Once these two totals have been settled it will be for the devolvedadministrations to determine the detailed distribution between the services for which they are responsible. The Government will continue to determineexpenditure on the services which remain their own responsibility whetherthroughout the United Kingdom, for the whole of Great Britain, for Englandand Wales or in England alone.30. The settlement of the block funds and the borrowing limits will be closely linked with the annual public expenditure review carried out by the Government.This settles spending programmes for the coming year and outline programmes for three further years ahead. The devolved administrations will be involvedin this process. The Mock&apos; funds will be settled bythe Government, subject tothe approval of Parliament, and normally, it is expected, with the agreementof the devolved administrations.31. No neat formula is capable of producing fair shares of public expenditure for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in varying circumstancesfrom year to year; this requires both sensitive political judgment and information about relative heeds and standards.32. The Government have already begun work on the scope for improving the base of objective information relevant to the devolved services; and they intend to discuss with the devolved administrations, once they are established,ways and meahs of achieving this. The objective is to ensure justice to theclaims of all parts of the United Kingdom and to make it easier to demonstrate that Justice has been done.33. Once fixed, the block funds will not necessarily remain unchanged.IT national economic factors make it desirable in any year to supplement agreedpubKc expenditure programmes, the Mock funds will be supplemented in thesame-way as the votes of the central government departments responsiblefor the services concerned. Similarly, If forecast public expenditure has to bereduced for national economic reasons the block funds will bear their fair shareof the cuts. The limits on capital&apos;expenditure to be financed by borrowingwill also be subject to adjustment as necessary,tDevelopment Ageadei34. As well as engaging m environmental improvements the Scottish and welsh Development Agencies provide factories and industrial estates and have powers of industrial investment similar to those which are exercisable by theNational Enterprise Board throughout the United Kingdom. The Agenciesare not responsible for regional selective assistance unless the Secretary of Statespecifically directs them to handle a particular application, in which case helays down in detail the basis on which assistance is to be offered and provides the necessary funds.35. After devolution both Agencies will be financed from the resources available for the devolved administrations and win operate subject to directionby them. As far as industrial investment functions are concerned, however, theadministrations will be required to ensure compliance with guidelines laid downby the territorial Secretary of State concerned. These guidelines will be incorporated in statutory instruments which can be annulled by Parliament.
As a result of the guidelines the Agencies will continue to operate on acommercial basis and their powers will not be used to provide &quot;soft&quot; loans orother forms of subsidy (except for the schemes for small grants to ruralindustries previously administered by the Small Industries Council for rural areas of Scotland or, in Wales, by the Council for Small Industries in rural areas). Similarly the Agencies will not be empowered to dispose of factoriesor industrial sites on terms more favourable than those on which the EnglishIndustrial Estates Corporation has to operate. Consultation and collaboration between the Agencies and the National Enterprise Board will continue.36. The Agencies will continue to have no powers to deal with applicationsfor regional selective assistance unless directed to do so by the Secretary ofState in a particular case. When a direction is given the Secretary of state will lay down the basis for any offer of assistance and will provide the necessary funds.37. The Agencies will have to present annual reports to Parliament, covering the functions which are subject to guidelines and any cases where they havebeen directed to handle applications for regional selective assistance. No doubtthese reports will be carefully scrutinised by Members representing other partsof the United Kingdom.38. Some people believe that English interests would benefit if there were an english Development Agency with a remit similar to that of the Scottish and welsh Agencies or, alternatively, that there should be a series of regional development Agencies in England with similar powers. Some of the main factors, for and against, are set out below to assist the discussion.39. The case which is made for development agencies is that they bringtogether in a single cohesive organisation various forms of developmentalsupport which would otherwise be channelled through a number of separateorganisations. A comprehensive approach to industrial development andpromotion is therefore greatly facilitated and, when necessary, action can betaken speedily and flexibly.40. On the other hand, the functions of the Scottish and Welsh DevelopmentAgencies are already carried out in England by different means. For example,factories and industrial estates are made available on a similar basis in theEnglish assisted areas by the English Industrial Estates Corporation, whilethe Development Commission helps rural areas whether within the assisted areas or not. The industrial development functions of the Agencies are carriedout in England by the National Enterprise Board; to develop its awarenessof regional needs the Board has established offices in Liverpool and Newcastle.And the environmental improvement powers of the Agencies are exercisableby local authorities. There is no clear evidence that these various functions would be more effectively carried out in England if merged, or that local authorities would welcome a change in the present arrangements in relation to such matters as derelict land clearance.41. Furthermore, it is doubtful whether a single English Agency, having toco-ordinate a range of environmental and industrial functions in the differingcircumstances of assisted areas which are spread from Cornwall to Northumbria,would be accepted as having the close familiarity with the problems of particular
areas which is looked, for from the Scottish and Welsh Agencies. On the otherhand, if a number of regional Development Agencies were established it wouldbe necessary to avoid the risk of wasteful competition between them to attractindustrial investment and employment.42. These factors have so far been judged to tip the balance of advantageagainst an English Agency or Agencies. But the Government do not rule out these suggestions and, indeed, would welcome further views on them.Summing np43. In brief, the position&apos; concerning industrial and economic powers, afterdevolution to Scotland and Wales, will be that:-(a) the Government will retain direct control over economic management and over regional policy, industrial policy and commercial policy;(b) the Government and Parliament will retain direct control over theamount of the block funds to be allocated to the devolved administrationsand over the total of capital expenditure financed by borrowing whichthey may authorise;(c) the Government will lay down statutory guidelines to control theindustrial investment operations of the Scottish and Welsh DevelopmentAgencies.44. These powers will be exercised by the Government with a view to ensuring that industrial investment is &quot;steered&quot; to the assisted areas and that resourcescontinue to be allocated to the different countries of the United Kingdom inaccordance with needs. Both England and Northern Ireland will continueto receive their fair shares of resources after devolution; and, in exercising their responsibilities within England, the Government intend to secure fairness forall the different parts. There is, in their view, no reason to suppose that the devolution, proposed for Scotland and Wales will in any way prejudice theeconomic prospects of any part of England.45. The Government will keep their regional policies under review, havingregard to the changing circumstances of the national economy. They willcontinue to give a high priority to stimulating industrial investment andemployment in the assisted areas, whether in England, Scotland, Wales orNorthern Ireland. They are prepared to consider an English DevelopmentAgency or Agencies, or any other innovation if it can be shown to offer goodprofpects of success in achieving these objectives.IV  Possibilities for change in England46. Change in England could take various forms, not all of which amountto &quot;devolution&quot;. As used in the Scottish and Welsh context &quot;devolution means the transfer of powers from a central authority. Changes in the structure ofgovernment in England would constitute devolution only if they involved some
transfer of powers from central government to a lower level.47. Discussion of the scope for change in the structure of English governmenthas, however, extended more widely than this. It has embraced also the wholequestion of the relationship between Whitehall and the local authorities; the structure and financing of local government; the allocation of functions between different levels of local government; the role of nominated bodies; and thearguments for and against an enhanced role for government at the regional level.48. In considering the implications for England of the proposals for Scotlandand Wales it is useful to have these issues in mind, although not all of them havedirect relevance to devolution. For example, the case for change in the structure and functions of local government in England-essentially the present counties and districts-has no necessary connection with devolution. It is an issue inits own right.49. Possible changes that have been suggested in the structure of governmentin England can be considered in two groups, described below as &quot;radical&quot;change and &quot;limited&quot; change. The factors to be weighed in any assessment of these proposals are discussed in Section V.Radical change50. Into this group fall various forms of new regional elected authorities with executive powers. Their nature and their relationship to existing authorities could vary very widely, depending on, among other things, the source of their powers; their system of finance; their range of functions; and their number,size and boundaries. The particular forms described in the following paragraphsare no more than illustrations drawn from a spectrum of possibilities.51. The overriding constitutional and parliamentary objections to a seriesof elected regional assemblies with powers to legislate on the Scottish patternhave already been considered in paragraph 20.52. There remains, however; the possibility of creating a series of electedregional assemblies with the ability to exercise functions in specified fields atpresent carried out by the central government. If these bodies followed the pattern proposed for the Welsh Assembly the administrative policy in suchmatters&apos;as education, health, housing, highways, water supply, local governmentand land use would be largely determined at regional level. Appropriate financial provision would have to be made, possibly by way of some form of block fund;and a substantial number of staff would be needed to enable the assemblies tocarry out their decisions. Devolution to bodies of this kind would enabledomestic affairs and priorities to be decided and administered at regional level.53. A second major possibility would involve not so much the devolution of central government powers but rather the creation of elected regional bodiesdrawing their powers from local government and nominated bodies, such asthe water authorities and health service authorities. It has been argued thatthere should be about a dozen directly elected regional authorities which mightbe responsible for planning, infrastructure development, and community land,water and sewerage, health and economic planning functions; these might be accompanied by &quot;multi-purpose&quot; district authorities whose responsibilitiesmight include housing, education, social services and other major functionsbelow the regional tier.
54. The establishment of elected regional authorities of this type would thus in practice directly involve a comprehensive reorganisation of local government.The present two-tier structure could not sensibly be combined with a thirdelected &quot;local&quot; tier. Many functions of the counties would therefore need to beraised to the new regional authorities and others would be transferred to the districts. This would require a substantial reorganisation of the districtauthorities, most of which would have to be enlarged in order to handle their new responsibilities. The regional authorities would require major sources offinance and staff.Limited rhwy55. Limited changes in governmental arrangements in the regions couldinvolve alterations to existing regional bodies or some adjustments to localgovernment, or both.56. At the regional level, proposals have been advanced for more effectiveregional advisory bodies. The present non-elected Regional Economic planning councils already bring together a wide range of interests within each region,including local government and industry. But it is argued that the regionsshould somehow be given a clearer voice, without involving substantial changesin the structure of government in England.57. Strengthened regional advisory bodies would exist primarily to representregional interests to central government and advise on regional needs. Theymight be based on the Economic Planning Councils, whose role could been larged to encompass a wider range of central and local government interests.Members might continue all to be appointed; or some might be appointed andothers elected indirectly by members of local authorities in the region. bodies of this kind, without executive powers, would not be large spenders and could operate with small staffs.58. The development of advisory machinery on these lines might be accompanied by increasing the representation of central departments in the regions and by improving interdepartmental liaison machinery there so thatthe regional advisory body could work in close co-operation with the officialscarrying out executive duties. In this way central departments would be moreaccessible to regional interests and better informed about local circumstances.This could result in better decision making without altering the responsibilities of Ministers or their accountability to Parliament.59. There are also options for limited change at the local government level.Wholesale reorganisation of the present structure may not be the only approach.An afternative might be to examine the present framework to identify itsstrengths and weaknesses, and to see what improvements could be made without tearing up local government by its roots: to embark, in short, ona process of local government reform.60. The elements which could be considered under this approach include thefollowing: (a) Functions. There has been a good deal of criticism of the distributionof functions within the present two-tier system, including for example the functional relationship between districts and counties in the
metropolitan areas, the division of planning powers between counties and districts generally and the extent of the various powers heldconcurrently by both tiers. The problems which have arisen under the1974 structure do not affect all areas in the same way. A reform approachcould start with a review of the tiers at which local authority functionsare performed; desirable changes could take place selectively and ifnecessary with different patterns in different parts of the country.(b) Boundaries. Changes in functions may call for changes hi boundaries.In addition, there will be a case in some areas for adjusting boundarieseither because they were unsatisfactorily set by the 1974 reorganisatioifor because developments since then have made change desirable.(c) Ad hoc combinations of local authorities to tackle particular problemswhere there is a clear need; wide-ranging powers for joint workingalready exist under the Local Government Act 1972.(d) The scope for democratising nominated bodies, such as water authorities,could also be examined.61. It would first be necessary to identify and evaluate the deficiencies in the1974 structure. This consultative process may form the starting point for suchan evaluation, leading to consideration of the scope for making improvements and the proper time-scale for change of this kind.V  The factors to be weighed62. Many factors, both of general public acceptability and of administrativefeasibility, are involved in consideration of the various forms of change outlined in Section IV.63. Before coming to their own conclusions the Government consider it essential to obtain as broadly based an impression as possible of the views of thepublic on these matters. They wish to establish whether existing institutions are regarded as deficient and, if so, how far and in what ways. To assist publicconsideration of possible changes this Section sets out the case for change anddraws attention to some of the main factors which have to be taken into account in assessing what changes may be practicable.The case for change64. The case for change in the structure of government in England has beenargued on a number of different grounds, the main features of which can besummarised as follows: (a) That the central machinery of government Parliament, Ministers andWhitehall departments-would be more efficient if it could concentrate on matters of genuinely national importance. Ministers and departments are at present overloaded by concern with too much administrative detail and with matters which could with more efficiency and sensitivity be
handled locally. The establishment of assemblies in Scotland and wales should accordingly be followed up by some corresponding lighteningof the pressures on the central government machine in relationto England.(6) That the decisions and processes of central government are too remotefrom the ordinary citizen. Taking more decisions at a level nearer to theindividual would ensure that local knowledge and interests were more fully taken into account and would stimulate participation in localaffairs.(c) That important nominated bodies, such as water and health authoritieswhose operations affect daily living conditions and bear closely on services provided by elected local authorities, should be subject to localdemocratic control. Either the functions of such bodies should betransferred to elected authorities or, if the bodies are to be retained,their members should be elected locally and not appointed by Ministers.(d) That there is a need for a layer of government to handle functions whichwould be better dealt with in a context smaller than the whole countrybut larger than the existing local authorities. Even after the 1974reorganisation of local government the new local authorities cover too small an area for the exercise of strategic planning responsibilities andtheir boundaries are too tightly drawn to facilitate the rehousing andredevelopment programmes needed in some of the larger cities. Thepresent division of responsibilities between the county and district levelsis not seen as the best available.The framework for change65. All these arguments for change place varying degrees of emphasis on theextent to which the over-riding criterion should be that of more efficient administration or more locally responsive government-two desiderata whichmay not always be reconcilable. In considering what changes may be practicable,and in balancing the benefits gained by each with additional problems whichmight be created at the same time, it is necessary to take account of theconstitutional, financial and other constraints that form the framework withinwhich any restructuring of government in England must take place. These are considered in the following paragraphs.Constitutional implications66. The framework in which any restructuring of government in England hasto be considered must clearly take account of the limits.imposed both by theneed to preserve the political and economic unity of the United Kingdom,which the overwhelming majority of people plainly desire, and by theimpracticability of federalism in the circumstances of the United Kingdom.67. But even while remaining within these constraints, some institutionalchanges would still create major problems. In particular, a system of regional assemblies with executive powers derived from central government would havefar-reaching effects on the present structure of ministerial, and parliamentaryresponsibilities, under which Ministers have responsibility for the developmentof policies and determination of priorities but are accountable to parliament for their decisions and actions.
68. The transfer to elected English regional bodies of powers at presentexercised by Ministers (whether at a departmental headquarters or in a regionaloffice) would have far-reaching constitutional implications; In particular itcould directly reduce their ability to maintain national policies on devolvedsubjects, limit the role of Parliament and restrict the scope of the work of its members. If regional authorities were able to determine the allocation of resources to particular programmes within their regions (and without thisability the exercise of their powers would in practice be severely restricted) thiswould fundamentally affect the ability of Ministers to account separately andcollectively to Parliament for the policies, standards and priorities of the servicesthey administer.69. Major organisational change, whether involving devolution of centralgovernment functions or the reorganisation of local government, would produceserious administrative problems. It would involve the creation of major newunits of administration and an inevitable need for substantial numbers of extrastaff. While it is not practicable to put specific costs to the changes, the creationof, say, a dozen regional authorities with powers similar to those of the, welsh assembly would involve thousands of additional staff and additional costsprobably running into hundreds of millions of pounds. **70. The more limited forms of change would not carry the major constitutionalimplications associated with regional assemblies or authorities, and they wouldnot involve the disruption and cost associated with major comprehensivereorganisation.&apos; Limited reform of local government might therefore be the mostpracticable approach to the shortcomings of local government structure.  &apos;71. However, such an approach carries its own dangers. It would be desirableto define as clearly as possible in advance the extent of the changes to be aimed at and the circumstances in which particular changes would be contemplated.Without this, a great deal of the existing organisation below the level of centralgovernment could be affected by uncertainties and this might hinder forward planning and efficient administration.Financial implications72. Regional assemblies would call for entirely new financial relationships.These bodies would be free, subject to statutory obligations, to allocateresources amongst the services for which they were responsible and developdistinctive policies based on their own view of regional priorities. Some wouldargue that this power to allocate resources should also extend to all services provided by the local authorities within the region.73. It would in theory be possible to pay each regional assembly a block fundas is proposed for Scotland and Wales. It is inherent in such a system that theGovernment^ influence over priorities between services and the ability ofMinisters to determine national policies and expenditure programmes wouldbe reduced. Indeed some would argue that this would be desirable. In relationto their own- directly administered services the regions themselves would settleprogrammes for large populations and wide areas; and in relation to servicesadministered by local authorities they would ensure that regional prioritieswere followed (as distinct from national ones, where these differed).74.  Such block funds would make the Governments task of economic
management more difficult. The composition of expenditure is importantbecause different types of expenditure have different effects on importanteconomic aggregates such as the balance of payments, the public sectorborrowing requirement and unemployment as well as different effects on thevarious sectors of the economy. It is true that the Government will not control the composition of expenditure on devolved services in Scotland and Wales.But to extend this relaxation of control to every region in England would have much larger effects and would make it vastly more difficult for the Governmentto exercise their essential functions in managing the economy of the UnitedKingdom as a whole.Boundaries75. Any study of possible regional institutions of government in England must take account of the problem of defining the areas over which they would operate. The number of the regions, and their boundaries, would need to reflecta balance between administrative efficiency, in terms of the functions for whichthey would be responsible; the facts of geography; and historical loyalties andtraditions. In some places-at Newcastle or Manchester, for example there isclearly a sense of regional awareness, but in other places not far away this maybe difficult to trace.76. If regional bodies were established with a wide range of executive powers the demarcation lines of regional boundaries would be of increasing practical importance to individuals because the nature and level of government services,and the spending priorities, might differ significantly between neighbouringregions. An important issue for consideration, therefore, is how far-againsta historical tradition of common standards new regional authorities in Englandcould be expected to command, especially in boundary areas, the public supportnecessary for the acceptance of potentially differing policies and standards,going far beyond the differences encountered in adjoining local authority areastoday.77. Moreover, boundaries suitable for one function are not necessarily suitablefor another. This may not be an insuperable problem but nobody can doubt thatthere are substantial difficulties involved. A clear example is water supply,since the areas covered by the regional water authorities have to be drawn up onthe basis of undivided river basins: regions suitable for water supply would makelittle sense for most other purposes. In the consultative document on the reviewof the water industry^7), the Government made it clear that they remainedcommitted to the principle of unified river basin management as the basis of theindustry^ regional structure, although they were well aware of the problems of reconciling the adequate democratic control of water authorities with the largesize of some of the river basins.78. Another example is health, where the boundaries of the regional health authorities must have regard to established patterns of delivery of health care,which are themselves largely determined by the location of major facilities suchas the large hospitals associated with universities and their medical schools.79. Yet another is transport, where the natural basis for control tends eitherto be national (railways) or local, as with bug operation, though the boundariesO Review of the Water Industry in England and Wales (Department of the Environment,Welsh Office and Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food-1976).
a national one in which the Secretary of State, with his Ministerial colleagues,sets national policies and objectives and has, in the last resort, power to issueformal directions to the regional and area authorities as to how they should exercise the functions delegated to them. Control of the health service by electedauthorities would require a complete redefinition of the central governmenfsrole in relation to it and would inevitably diminish its national character.86. Radical reorganisation of this kind would raise major questions as to how the health service should be financed and&apos; what the lines of accountability shouldbe. Major changes of organisation would be expensive both in the administrative costs of planning and carrying them through and also in the effects whichorganisational upheaval would have on morale and in the conflicts and uncertainty that would-accompany it.87. The Government have appointed the Royal Commission on the national health Service to consider the best use and management of the financial and manpower resources of the Service. The memorandum that the commission has issued on its task makes clear that it will be examining the structure of theService and its relationship to central and local government. It will need to take into account the development of thinking on devolution in England and its ownconclusions will make an important contribution to that thinking. A finaldecision on the structure of the National Health Service must await receiptand consideration of the Commission^ Report.Summing op88.  To sum up, the case for change is seen to lie in: (a) lightening the burden on central government, enabling it to concentrate on matters of genuinely national importance;(b). bringing government closer to the people;(c) rendering the work of major nominated bodies subject to local democraticcontrol; and(d) providing a layer of government to deal with such matters as may bebetter dealt with at a level intermediate between central and localgovernment as they now exist.89. But the case for any particular form of change has to be examined withina framework of practical constraints and implications. On this basis, the viability of possible new forms of government in England depends on the view taken of: (a) the constitutional implications, including the effect on the powers ofMinisters to maintain national policies and oh the role of Parliament;(b) the financial implications, including the arrangements for funding any new institutions;(c) the problems of drawing new boundaries; and(d) other implications, including the effects on existing institutions, bothduring the transitional period and in the longer term, and the extent towhich the problems that are seen can be tackled without radical change.
do not in some cases accord with those of any one local authority.80. Again, regional areas suitable for strategic land use planning purposesmight prove too large for other services often proposed for a regional level, suchas police and the fire service. If county authorities were to disappear, mostexisting districts outside the main conurbations would probably be too small interms of population either for education and personal social services or asequivalents of (or replacements for) area health authorities (now based on non-metropolitan counties, metropolitan districts and London boroughs).81. It would be desirable to achieve a reasonable balance between regions interms of size and economic potential, but London and the South East presenta special problem from this point of view. The population of the area coveredby the South East Economic Planning Region is 17 million people over one-third that of England, three times that of Scotland and almost six times thatof Wales. This problem could not be solved by breaking up the area intoartificial sub-units. Any proposals for a regional structure would have to take account of the dominance of the South East in relation to the rest of England,and of London over the rest of the South East.Other implications82. The present structures of local government, the National Health Service,the regional water authorities and the police service have been in existence forless than three years. These new structures are still in the process of settlingdown. The Government are fully aware of the widespread criticism of certain aspects, but any further major redistribution of local government functions would be bound to take a good many years to plan and carry out. And toattempt radical change affecting London and the rest of the country simul-taneously would be unprecedented; previous reorganisations affecting Londonseparately were major tasks in their own right. The expected long-term benefits of any change have to be measured against the disruptive effects in themeantime. And if one set of changes follows another the point may come atwhich the penalties of the process of change outweigh the advantages whichit is hoped ultimately to achieve.83. There is also the effect on the individual citizen. A further reorganisationso soon after the last one would be bound to create confusion in the mind ofthe average elector. It is also probable that he would feel more remote from the affairs of a local government body administering services over a much widerarea-as would certainly be the case with regional authorities.84. There is at present a direct relationship between local authority boundariesand the boundaries of health regions and areas. Unless the benefits of thisrelationship were to be set aside any major reorganisation of local governmentwould have to be accompanied by changes in the National Health Service.85. A reorganisation of local government which involved the assumption of responsibilities for the health service would require a fundamental reorganisation of the National Health Service. This is an Exchequer-financed service with twolevels of management accountable to the Secretary of State for Social Services.Virtually all the statutory functions are vested in him and he in turn makes themexercisable by the 14 regional and 90 area health authorities. The service is
a national one in which the Secretary of State, with his Ministerial colleagues,sets national policies and objectives and has, in the last resort, power to issueformal directions to the regional and area authorities as to how they should exercise the functions delegated to them. Control of the health service by electedauthorities would require a complete redefinition of the central governmentsrole in relation to it and would inevitably diminish its national character.86. Radical reorganisation of this kind would raise major questions as to how the health service should be financed and what the tines of accountability shouldbe.

VI  The consultative process90. As explained in Section I, this consultative document does not put forward proposals for changes in the structure of government in England. The Govern-ment wish to hear and consider views and to carry out their own further studiesbefore deciding what, if any, changes to recommend1.91. The main purpose of this consultative document has accordingly-been toset out in general terms the broad issues which the Government consider shouldbe before members of the public when they. fom. their, own conclusions on whether or not there is a need for change and, if so, what forms such, changemight take,92. There can clearly be a variety of replies to the central question which, this document poses: are there any specific ways in which the structure of govern-rhent in England might be altered so as to rnalte it niofe democraticallyaccountable, responsive and efficient, reduce the burdens on Whitehall andWestminster and develop its full potential for improving the quality of life?93. There are, on the one hand, those who feel that: the predoniihant require-ment at present is for a period of stability and that efforts should be concentrated on making the present system work better. Oh the&apos; other hand, there ait people who feel that what is needed is the establishment of directly-elected regionalasaeunbOev taking functions from central government,-local^gwerarhent andnominated bodies. Between these two positions lies a whole-series of intermediate.options which shade into each other......    ...  ......94. These are manifestly difficult matters and need thorough consideration and-debate. Behind them lie two questions of great importance to the efficiency ofgovernment and to all citizens and taxpayers, namely:  -  &apos;(a) Whether government would be more acceptable, accessible andaccountable if there were a new regional layer of democratically electedgovernment exercising functions at present exercised centrally or locally 7(b) Whether, if ways could be found of bringing this about, governmentwould be more efficient?95. What the Government now want is to find out in which ways people inEngland would like to see our institutions develop. To preserve its vitalitya parliamentary democracy must be capable of adapting to changing needs andpressures, external and internal hence the proposals for Scottish and Welshdevolution and the need for thought and debate about English institutions.It is the purpose of this consultative document to encourage that thought andstimulate that debate.96. Government departments will be writing direct to bodies with which theyare regularly in contact seeking their views on the matters raised in thisconsultative document. Among the issues on which views are invited are: (i) In what fields of government responsibility in England, if any, is itconsidered that the present level at which decisions are taken (Whitehall/nominated bodies/counties/districts) is wrong?(ii) Is there a case for an English Development Agency or for English
regional Development Agencies (see Section 111)?(iii) What are the advantages and disadvantages (see Section IV) of-(a) no change;(to) some form of radical change;(c) some form of limited change;(iv) Do people in England have a sense of regional identity strong enoughto support regional units of government?(v) What principles should determine the size of regional areas? How shouldthe boundaries be drawn? How many regions should there be? what should be done about London and the South East?(vi) If regional units were set up, should their functions be only advisoryand co-ordinating or should they have executive powers ?(vii) How should any such units be financed?(viii) Would the development of regional institutions solve or reduce anynational problems? If so, which?(jx) Would substantial variations between regions in the standard of public services, and the choice of spending priorities, be acceptable?(x) What are the deficiencies in the present structure, boundaries and&apos; distribution of functions within local government? How might they be remedied, broadly within the present structure?. (xi) What is the degree of urgency of any changes in English arrangements which may be desired ?97. Members of the public wishing to express their views on these issues orany other aspect of the matters discussed in this consultative document areinvited to write to the Constitution Unit, Cabinet Office, Great George Street,London SW1P3AQ.
