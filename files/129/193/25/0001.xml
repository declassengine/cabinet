(confidential^ANNEX to cp(76)I35.DEVOLUTION TO SCOTLAND AND WALES :POST-ASSENT REFERENDAA.   SUMMARY AND conclusions.     This paper surveys the general considerations about referenda ondevolution after Parliament has passed the Scotland and Wales Bill.   It offersno judgment on the main issue of principle.   It concludes, however, that ifthere are to be referenda the form that would be simplest, most convenient andmost likely to meet the requirements of Ministers would be:-a. Simultaneous but separate referenda in Scotland and Wales (paragraph 9).b. Decision by simple majority of those voting (paragraph 10).c. Once-for-all, not repeatable (paragraph 11).d. The outcome to be a direct trigger for action, not just advisory toParliament (paragraph 13).e. Voting to be confined to those resident in Scotland or Wales, as appropriate (paragraphs 15-20).f. Voters to be asked in substance simply whether or not they wanted theprovisions of the devolution Act to be implemented in Scotland/Wales(paragraphs 21-22).The biggest potential difficulty seems likely to relate to the question of who shouldbe asked (paras 15-20).   A case can be made for extending the questions to theEnglish (and Northern Irish).   This could lead to a very awkward outcome.   Therewould accordingly be grave risks in embarking on the referendum route unlessMinisters were satisfied that it will prove practicable to limit the referenda tothose resident in Scotland or Wales.The Concept2.   Referenda before Parliament^ detailed consideration of the Bill would delaydevolution a full year.   A separate referendum Act would be needed, and by thetime this was passed and the referenda conducted there would be too little timeB.   GENERAL CONSIDERATIONSleft for the main Bill in the 1976/77 Session.   There is the further point that suchJ
(confidential)referenda would relate to devolution proposals which Parliament might laterchange significantly.3.    No similar objections arise if the implementation of devolution, afterParliament has passed the Bill, requires popular approval by referendum.   TheAssemblies cannot reasonably come into existence before the spring of 1978 inany event.   The referenda could fit (though tightly) into the autumn of 1977.   Theirholding, by prolonging the period in which commitments on practicalimplementation (eg buildings and staff recruitment) were formally at risk,would certainly be an inconvenience to planning, but hardly enough to imperil thegeneral timetable, provided a robust view were taken on what work could continue. *4.    It would be simplest, and would save Parliamentary time, to provide forreferenda in the Scotland and Wales Bill itself rather than separately.5.    It would be a constitutional novelty to make the force of an Act of Parliamenteffectively  conditional upon a plebiscite.   The result could be a temporary legaloddity - if the Scottish scheme were approved and the Welsh one rejected, living and dead elements would be intermingled in the Act.   There is however nothingunworkable about this, and it would in any event be possible (perhaps undercontingency provision in the Bill) to tidy matters up fairly promptly by consolidationprocedures. wMerits6.    The background to the general case for and against referenda is thata. The passage of the Scotland and Wales Bill seems of the first importanceto the Government and the Union.b. On current evidence, the Parliamentary risks to this passage areuncomfortably high.c. Considerable value should therefore be attached to any measures likelyto reduce these risks.-2-*For example, by not halting work already in hand on buildings, and by allowingat least internal Civil Service &quot;trawls&quot; for staff to proceed.^Whether this would also be the formal position is considered in paragraph 13below.[confidential)4(
(confidential)7.    The case for referenda is that there is widespread and still growingpressure for them, notably from the Press, Opposition figures and some ofthose Government supporters in Parliament whose hostility endangers the Bill.There are many signatures to pro-referendum motions on the House of CommonsOrder Paper.   In both Scotland and Wales the public seem increasingly ready totake for granted, and to welcome, the prospect of a referendum.   The pressurereflects inter alia a belief that it is, at best, unproven that the people of Scotlandand Wales want devolution.   Conceding post-Assent referenda:a. woold meet this widespread demand, which is becoming almost anexpectation;b. would be a conciliatory gesture by the Government to those who areuneasy or sceptical;c. would destroy or weaken one of the weapons in the hands of some ofthose determined to be hostile;d. might make it easier for those Conservatives who are not totallyhostile to soft-pedal outright opposition (on the grounds that popular votecan be left to settle the main question) and adopt a constructive approach to the detail;e. would offer the Conservative Party, whose opposition to Welshdevolution runs deep, &apos;at least the possibility that popular vote wouldkill this scheme for them, thus rendering it less necessary for them touse Parliamentary obstruction.These are the main advantages in relation to the Bill&apos;s passage.   There couldbe important advantages in the longer term - assuming that referenda had the outcome for which the Government would hope - in underpinning the operation of devolution by demonstrating that it was welcomed by the people, and not foistedupon them.   The more close-run the Bill&apos;3 passage in Parliament, the greater thecase for wider legitimation.8.    The main counter-arguments are these:-a. Referenda on devolution would extend a device to which there is muchconstitutional objection. Its adoption soon after the European Communityreferendum might heighten risks^of addiction.   The formal constitutional(confidential)
confidential)objections might be greater than in the European case.   The devolutionreferenda would in effect decide whether an Act of Parliament should come into operation, and this moreover in a strictly domestic subject.b. Government supporters in Wales have made clear that they would greatly dislike the idea.   (But they would presumably dislike still more theBiTPs loss, which is what referenda would be designed to avoid.   In any event, it seems unlikely that their displeasure could worsen the votingposition in Parliament. )c. While there seems little risk that Scotland would say No, the possibilityis less remote in Wales.   (If it materialised, the Governments prestigewould suffer a set-back, but perhaps not a disastrous one;  the people would have spoken, on an opportunity specially created by the Government,and the Government might feel able to accept the outcome with calm.)d. Any outcome, even if formally favourable to devolution, which restedon materially less than half the total electorate might be politically awkward,especially if nationalist parties had campaigned for abstentions;  it could be argued that the settlement lacked full-hearted consent.e. Referendum provisions would add to the Bill&apos;s controversial substanceand the tightness of the time allocation (given that the Prime Minister has promised scope for their full discussion).   Even if referenda diminishedgeneral objections to the Bill, they would not meet them all.   The provisions would moreover open new areas for argument (paragraphs 24-26 below).t.   It is not clear how much extra support, in terms of specific votes, couldbe bought by proposing referenda.   Relatively few anti-devolution MPsappear to rest their case primarily on doubts about whether the people ofScotland or Wales want devolution.   Some anti-devolution MPs might findcertain features (eg. not asking England - paragraphs 16-20 below) moreobjectionable than having no referenda at all.g.   Referenda could expose divergences within the prospectively devolvedterritories - for example, within a Scottish Yes, Shetland might voice astrong No. * (But it is not easy to see what Shetland could then do to harm-4.* After the European referendum precedent, it would seem impossible to avoidsome breakdown of the results.(confidential)
(confidential)the devolution settlement. It would seem both politically and administrativelyout of the question to let Shetland opt out of Scotland for devolution purposes,)j.   Once the principle were conceded, it might not be easy to ensure inParliament that the referenda took the form desired, and in particular thatEngland was excluded from voting.k.   The outcome could mean that Parliament had wasted much scarce legisl-ative time.   The possibility of this would not help constructive discussionduring an arduous Committee stage.C.   THE FEATURES OF POST-ASSENT REFERENDA9.    There would be two separate referenda - one about Scotland, one about Wales.They would be simultaneous.   (A Scottish one held first and producing an over-whelming Yes might increase the chance of Yes in Wales;  but this is conjectural,and different timing would be hard to justify.)10.   The outcome should depend on simple majority of votes.   Regrettable thoughit might be if a result were decided 51 : 49 on a low poll, it seems impossible to lay down minima for majority or turn-out (especially as nationalist parties mighturge abstention).11.    The referenda should be once-for-all affairs, to be held within a set time.Though there is a case for repeatability in the event of a No answer, this wouldrisk making the subject a running sore;  in addition the &quot;dormant&quot; provisions mightprogressively become outdated in detail.12.   Presumably in any referenda members of the Government would campaignunitedly;  the special considerations which led to a different arrangement for theEuropean referendum do not apply.13.   It seems inevitable that the outcome of the referenda should itself be decisive -a direct trigger to the Act &apos;s implementation, not just a finding advisory toParliament.   While it would be technically possible to make it advisory*, thiswould be an empty concept if a result was clearcut and could pose a very awkwardParliamentary situation if a result was not.   It would also import another Btage of delay. .5.&quot;For example, the fixing of appointed days tor the Act &apos;s coming into force might require Order in Council following affirmative resolution, which in turn would need debate and vote by Parliament after and in the light of the referenda results.(confidential)
(confidential)14. The most difficult problems concern who should be asked, and what theyshould be asked.Who Should be Asked15,   All Parliamentary voters^ in Scottish and Welsh constituencies should clearly be eligible to vote in the respective referenda.   For reasons of definition andpracticability it would not be possible (even if, which is debatable, it werelogically appropriate) to give any special voice to others who regard themselves as Scottish or Welsh but who currently live elsewhere, though their exclusion will &apos;no doubt give rise to complaint.16,   The difficult issue is whether votes in England and Northern Ireland - andlogically also, in each case, the voters of the &quot;other&quot; devolved territory - shouldtake part.   Some MPs - primarily perhaps anti-devolution!sts - must be expectedto argue that they should, on the basis that devolution is a new form of partnershipand that all partners should have a say.   (Sir Harold Wilson, when Prime Minister,virtually said as much^ when indicating difficulties about devolution referenda.)17.   There are however serious drawbacks about letting all parts vote.   &quot;Outside&quot;voters, standing to be less affected, will naturally know much less and care much less about the problem than Scottish/Welsh ones.   Yet because of their numbersthey could easily produce, even on a low poll plainly reflecting comparativeindifference, an overall result contrary to the overwhelming vote of those most directly affected.   This would seem both unfair and a sure recipe for majorconflict, with anti-Union parties the political beneficiaries.18.   The exclusion of outside voters could be justified in debate both on these grounds and on the grounds that the United Kingdom interest and views will havebeen looked after by the United Kingdom Parliament;  that England, with over80% o  the membership of that Parliament, will have had its say amply there;and that the case for ascertaining Scottish and Welsh opinion by some specialdevice is precisely that they are heavily outnumbered in Parliament (Scotland8 : 1, Wales 17 : 1) and have no other instrument to speak for them on something of 3uch special and lasting importance and of far greater concern to them than to the rest.   These points are of considerable presentational value, but it could still be argued that they do net go to the heart of the matter;  in the last resorti _-6-____*And probably peers, as in the Kuropean referendum.i Hansard col.(confidential)
(confidential)the argument that changes in the terms affecting some members of a partnershipshould be put to all its members, rather than just those more immediately affected,is a telling one.19.   Ministers could however also draw attention to the fact that the repeatableNorthern Ireland border plebiscite, although concerned with the territoriallimits of the United Kingdom, is confined to voters resident in Northern Ireland.20.  The case of those who criticise the exclusion of England and Northern Irelandvoters will be at its most formidable if they can reasonably allege that the devolution settlement gives Scotland and Wales special privileges - &quot;having theircake and eating it&quot; - and that England/Northern Ireland should be asked whetherthey are prepared to tolerate this favoured treatment.   The most likely ground for such a claim would be unchanged numbers and role for Scottish and Welsh MPaat Westminster.   Any concession the Government were to make in this respect(eg an agreement to refer the question of numbers to the Speaker&apos;s Conference ifthe Scotland and Wales Bill became law) would thus ease indirectly the task of defending the exclusion of English and Northern Ireland voters from referenda.But it would also mean that the package the Scots were being invited to approve was less clearly defined;  it might subsequently turn out to have involved a relativereduction in their representation at Westminster - a factor which some Scots might feel would make the devolution package significantly less advantageous, or even,overall, disadvantageou s.What Question(s)?21.   The referenda would have to ask whether or not the voters wanted theschemes set out in the Act to be put into practice.   The precise wording would need careful thought (though in general it would seem desirable to seek wordingwhich set devolution plainly within the context of continued union),22,  Any form of the question offering more than two options ought to be ruled out.   Two options only should tend to maximise the Yes vote and (by much thesame token) the difficulties posed for separatists.   Three or more options wouldheighten the risk of a politically if aot formally indecisive result, with no absolutemajority for any one option.   Options like &quot;more devolution&quot; or &quot;less devolution&quot;,as some opinion has suggested, would wholly lack precision.   They might imply,- 7-
(confidential)quite wrongly, that the Government believed technically workable devolutioncould provoke endless argument during and after the Bill&apos;s passage,23. There remains the issue of whether any further questions beyond the basicones should be put. The main candidate would be a question about separation -does Scotland/Wales want to remain part of the United Kingdom?24.  The main attractionsof this are:a. It would meet a widely-expressed view.b. Big majorities in favour of staying in the United Kingdom - say four or five to one in Scotland and ten or more to one in Wales, as seems withinthe range of reasonable possibility - would be a heavy blow to the nationalistparties and indirectly an aid to the practical and constructive working ofthe devolution settlement, as weakening any claim that devolution was merelya staging post on the road to the goal that the people really wanted.25.  The main considerations on the other side are these :-a. Having a question on separation would be widely interpreted as meaning that the Government accepted this as a serious and realistic issueon the United kingdom&apos;s political agenda.b. The precision of the question would be illusory.   On what terms would it be assumed that independence would come?  In Scotland, the SNP mightsecure an inflated vote for separation by putting across a glamorisedhaving-it-both ways picture of what it entailed - eg. all the oil revenue,little or none of the United Kingdom&apos;s international debt, and continuing&quot;UK&quot; privileges on the Eire model or better.   At best posing such a question would raise much argument about terms;  and the Government might find ituncomfortable to enter this debate, since it could amount to the appearance of a &quot;shadow&quot; negotiation about independence in public.  However the argument went, it might mean giving the SNP the limelight and the chance tomake the running, swinging the focus of the referendum campaign away fromthe Governments devolution scheme.schemes of radically different kinds to exist, and their formulation and meaning-8-
(confidential)6.  There are various further considerations against having a question onseparation:a. The device works as the Government would want only if there is an overwhelming dismissal of separatism.   This may be judged probable;but opinion polls have in the past shown figures as high as 30% in scotland in favour of &quot;dominion&quot; status. *  A 70 : 30 result (given that the Scottishsituation is widely seen as a developing and not a static one) might not amount to a conclusive defeat of separatism.b. The ostensibly separatist vote might be inflated by non-separatistvoters using their answers tactically to express discontent with theGovernment, or with particular limitations of the devolution scheme, or with the general condition of Scotland/Wales.c. Against the background that the prospect of North Sea oil as a UKasset is a vital element in the UK&apos;s creditworthiness abroad, the veryposing of the separatist question could have undesirable effects, especially if the matter hit the headlines at an economically critical time - foreignobservers might conclude that separatism was a serious possibility.These effects could be deepened if the referendum campaign highlighted,however hypothetic ally, the terms of separation (paragraph 25b above), and still further if the eventual result in Scotland were less than overwhelminglyin favour of the Union.d. The result on the separatism question might weaken the force of aYes vote on the &quot;devolution&quot; question.   It might be argued (particularly ifthe nationalists had campaigned for Yes on devolution) that the &quot;separatist&quot;vote on the second question ought in logic to be deducted from the &quot;pro-devolution&quot; vote on the first;  and that devolution as a stable settlement didnot therefore have the full-hearted consent of the Scottish/Welsh people.   Ineffect, the addition of the second question could be claimed to produce a&quot;multi-option&quot; result, and so could prolong controversy and uncertainty andundermine readiness to concentrate on making devolution work.*A recent poll in the Scottish &quot;Daily Record&quot; gave a figure as high as 44% infavour of independence;  but there is room for doubt about its soundness.-9-
(confidential)e. There is much less clear logical justification for a question onseparatism than for the first question.   The first question is the triggerfor action;  the second one would not be.   Its inclusion would widen andlengthen debate on the Bill, to no precise operational end.f. Once one adds to the first and &quot;operational&quot; question, it may be progressively less easy to resist adding yet further ones (eg. about moreor less devolution; or the Conservative scheme;  or Liberal ideas onfederalism),f.   It might be less easy to justify the exclusion of English and NorthernIrish voters in relation to a new question of such fundamental constitutionalimportance,h.   It might also be less easy to justify excluding &quot;non-resident&quot; Scots and welsh, yet the practical difficulties of bringing them in would be, at best,very formidable.27.  On balance, the arguments in paragraphs 24-26 point against having afurther question on whether or not Scotland/Wales should remain part of theUnited Kingdom.Subsidiary Aspects28.  &quot;Various subsidiary aspects would need to be considered if referenda were tobe held - matters like the organisation of the count, the circulation of information,and expenses of any campaigning groups.   The precedent of the Europeanreferendum is available, and there is no reason to foresee in these respects anyproblem so acute as to weigh heavily in the main decision.Cost29.  No detailed costing is feasible in advance of detailed planning.   But on the analogy of the European referendum it seems unlikely that the cost, for Scotlandand Wales combined, could exceed      S.3M      A sum of this order, though in itselfan unwelcome new charge on the contingency reserve, does not seem to rank as a major factor,-10-Cabinet Office Constitution Unit14    December 1.976   /^TZZTTZTTZ^TTZTTT^.(^confidential )
