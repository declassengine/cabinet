DOCUMENT ZS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(76) 1276 December 1976PUBLIC EXPENDITURE; PENSIONS increases in THE PUBLIC SECTORMemorandum     the Lord Privy SealINTRODUCTION1.        The Chancellor of the Exchequer has circulated proposals for savings in public expenditure (CP(76) 126).    This paper sets out what would be involved in modifying the arrangements for pensions increase in the public sector if it was agreed that this should form part of those savings.SAVINGS2.        The various groups of workers and the savings at issue are described in Annex 12 to CP(76) 126.    So far as the public services aloneare concerned, savings in the financial year 1977-78 could only be made from december 1977.   A postponement of the December 1977 uprating untilbeyond the end of 1977-78 would reduce the estimated level of public service pension payments (on the assumptions of CP(76) 126 about earnings and prices) by  43 million in that year and  166 million in 1978-79.    A limitationof the 1977 and 1978 upratinga to net earnings would reduce the payments by 13 million in 1977-78 and  91 million in 1978-79.    The savings in the restof the public sector might be up to half as much again.COVERAGE3.        There are over 1 million public service pensioners and over half as many again from the rest of the public sector.    Many of these receive verysmall pensions.    Neither they nor the unions concerned and their members will lightly accept the loss of full price indexation.    It is in my viewessential, in order both to maximise the savings and to minimise theopposition of those affected, that the coverage of any restriction should be aswide as possible.    At the very minimum, the whole of the public sector,including the nationalised industries, should be covered.    If this is done,and especially if the restrictions are matched by corresponding action on social security benefits, the reaction of the public service unions is unlikely to be extreme,copy NO       31CABINET
4.        In equity, and more particularly to avoid charges of die criminationagainst the public sector, whatever restrictions are applied there should beapplied also to the private sector.    While this possibility should be considered,&apos;I recognise that there may be considerable practical problems.5.        There is a particular problem which could be troublesome.    UnderInland Revenue rules tax relief is given to permit the uplift of an out-of-datesalary for pension purposes by the increase in the cost of living from any ofthe preceding five years up to the date of retirement (the so-called pre-award dynamisation).    There is no such pre. -award dynamisation in the mainpublic services.    But in a recent nationalised industry case, a man with an actual salary of  17, 000 (compared with  22, 000 recommended by the TopSajftriep Review Body but not yet implemented) has, through the operation ofthis arrangement, been pensioned on the basis of a notional final salary of 30, 000.    He had relatively short service but the cost of this arrangement,ever the period since its introduction was the equivalent of a tax freeaddition to salary of some  15, 000 a year.    Had the man had a full 40 yearspension, this figure would have been over  50, 000 a year.    Tax incentiveswhich have this effect aro themselves highly questionable.    And there isclearly a strong case for stopping thorn if inflation-proofed pensions are to stop.    It would o  course be particularly difficult to let this practice eontinuefor high pensions in the nationalised industries at the same time as we restrictpensions increase for the low average pensions of the public services.6.        There is also a question whether any change would be needed in the taxreliefs affecting tne provision for or payments of post-award pensionsincreases in private occupational schemes.    I realise that action on either ofthese problems raiseb difficult issues and that an immediate decision is notpossible, but officials should be asked to report urgently on the facte, of thematter and the most effective way of imposing necessary restraints.EXTENT AND PRESENTATION OF THE CHANGES7.        We have said many times that we believe in the principle of preserving the purchasing power of all pensions, and indeed inflation-proofingwas the cornerstone of the new State pension scheme.    We ought therefore toplace the necessary restrictions firmly within the context of the currentabnormal economic circumstances.    The best course would be to suspend theexisting automatic links with prices for a limited period of no more than threeyears on the basis that at the end of that period they should return unless itwas otherwise decided.    During the period we would decide each year whatdegree of restriction was necessary in the light of the economic and other circumstances at the time.    In the meantime we should also consider whether in the schemes we control we wanted to go over to some other regular basis for fixing increases.2
LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS8.        Public service pensioners (those from the Civil Service, localgovernment, the National Health Service, the teaching profession, thepolice and fire services, Ministers, Members of Parliament and othersmaller groups) have a statutory right to price indexation under the Pensions(Increase) Act 1971.    The Act would need to be amended to give theGovernment freedom to decide well before 1 December the annual increases to be given under each annual Order.    For the Armed Forces, who follow the Act by analogy by Prerogative Instrument, similar arrangements couldbe made.    The precise form of the amendments requires further study butthey should not be complicated or difficult.9.        In the rest of the public sector (mainly the nationalised industries),the basis of awarding pension increases is of 3 kinds:-a. By direct application of the 1971 Act.   Any amendment to that Act would therefore apply here also.b. By discretion.    A Ministerial directive might serve to restrict increases should this be necessary,c. By contractual right, eg where pensions increase isbuilt into schemes.    Wider ranging, but still quite simple,legislation would be required involving the suspension of thecontractual obligations of these schemes and of any under b.above not covered by a Ministerial directive.10.       The necessary legislative steps should be taken ao soon as possiblein the new Session but would in any case have to be completed well before1 December 1977 in order to affect the 1977 increases under the Pensions(Increase) Act.CONCLUSIONS11.       If we wish to modify the arrangement for Pensions Increase in thepublic sector we should take the following steps:-i. The Pensions (Increase) Act 1971 should be amended so as togive the Government discretion to vary the amount of annual pensions increase for a period of three years on the basis described inparagraph 7 above.il. The necessary steps should be taken to ensure uniformity of treatment throughout the public sector.iii. Officials should submit early and detailed proposalssetting out the legislative and other steps necessary to giveeffect to the above recommendations.3
iv. Officials should report urgently on pensions increase in theprivate sector and pre-award dynamisation generally and on the most effective way of imposing necessary restraints.PCivil Service Dapartment6 December 19764
