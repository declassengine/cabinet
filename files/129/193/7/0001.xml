THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTTS GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of........................................TOP secret copy No. 28CP(76) 11729 November 1976CABINETTHE REAL CHOICES FACING THE cabinet memorandum by the Secretary of State for EnergyINTRODUCTION1. In his paper to the Cabinet of 22 November (CP(76) 111) theChancellor advised us of the grave economic dangers facing the countrydue to the run down of our reserves and the need to fund them by anInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) loan, later to be supplemented by amore general funding of the sterling balances which we were told cannot beachieved without accepting the loan.2.        The Chancellor also advised us that the conditions the IMF would belikely to impose would involve a cut in the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) of at least  if billion, including  1 billion in straightcuts in public expenditure in 1977-78 with differing arrangements to be phased in for 1973-79 aQ as to provide a two year cover for our externalposition,3.        During the Cabinet discussion an alternative proposal was discussedcomprising a  1 billion reduction in the PSBR of which nearly a half wouldderive from the sale of public holdings in British Petroleum (BP), leaving the other  ^ billion to be covered by a mixture of tax increases and cuts.4.        It was agreed that further discussions should be held with the IMFat the highest level to sound them out on this approach and on a generalrelaxation of their original terms.THE DANGERS DERIVING FROM IMF CONDITIONS5.        It became clear at the Cabinet that certain dangers to theGovernments economic, industrial and political strategy might flow fromthe Chancellors proposals.
6.        These can be summarised as follows:i. They would be very deflationary when unemployment is so high and rising, investment is slow and sluggish, interest rates are high already, and living standards are falling and due to fallmore sharply.ii. They would involve cuts into public services so deep as to endanger their basic function and cuts in social benefits that would put at risk the Social Contract.iii. They would put at risk our Parliamentary majority bycreating circumstances that might make it difficult for labour members to carry through the necessary legislation.7,        There are other dangers that we did not discuss, but which theCabinet must consider while awaiting the outcome of the further discussions with, the Fund,a. Any agreement with the Fund which controls the DomesticCredit Expansion (DCE) if accepted might carry policy Implicationsnot immediately apparent.The Letters of Intent already sent to the IMF in association withour earlier drawings and borrowing under the oil facility did commitus to DCE targets which, since they have not been met, haveprecipitated much of the lack of confidence which has led to thepresent sterling crisis and driven us back to the Fund with the expiry of the standby credit.b. DCE targets at or below our present expectation might not immediately impact upon the PSBR, but if exceeded could commitus now to future cuts in the PSBR of an unpredictable magnitudeat an unspecified date which could be quite soon,c. Further cuts or tax increases designed to bring the DCEback into line with targets we had agreed would then follow on a scale and in a form that might commit us to further deflation,higher unemployment and lower benefits or public expenditure from which the Cabinet cannot escape within the terms of a newLetter of hitent.d. The Chancellor has told us repeatedly in the past that a loan from the IMF would not be available to us unless we were preparedto give a categorical assurance that we would forgo completely our right to impose import controls or exchange controls during thetwo year period which the IMF loan will cover.
e.        Some references were made by colleagues to the possibilityof a wage/price freeze as an alternative or addition to ourpresent policies which it seemed to be suggested we might offerin return for easier conditions.    The Cabinet has not discussed this, but with inflation now forecast to rise to 16 per cent in thecoming year, a wage freese - whether sought voluntarily orimposed statutorily, would terminate the Social Contract andshould therefore not be mentioned in any talks with the Fund.THE REAL CHOICE8.        i. The IMF RoadThe Cabinet is therefore faced with a real choice,   we might accept that a loan is inescapable and unavoidable ia which case we are bound in the end to accept the very best conditions that wecan negotiate, even if they fall far short of what we think right and involve us in all the dangers set out above, including a commitment to abandon an option to introduce the alternativestrategy during the duration of the loan.Indeed if we allow ourselves to be persuaded mat there is no alternative to the loan we surrender from that moment to anydemands that may be made upon us whatever their consequence for the British people and whether or not we were able to carrythem through as a Government.ii.       The Alternative StrategyThe case for the alternative strategy has been argued in theCabinet before.    It is based on a plain recognition that the strategywe have followed since March 1974 has failed, and in recommending that we accept the IMF conditions the Chancellor too has nowrecognised that the existing policy as failed.The alternative strategy is based upon the belief that the price wemust pay for borrowing to finance a free trade policy is too highbecause it involves unacceptable levels of unemployment,unacceptably low levels of investment and a progressivedeterioration of our manufacturing capacity.   All these tendenciescan be observed to be at work now and our forecasts imply that theywill be accelerated by the conditions the IMF might require us toaccept.9.        Since we are starting afresh the Cabinet should now look at a fivepoint plan for national recovery, which if adopted will be the basis for a vigorous public campaign for oupport and would extend up to, during and beyond the next General Election,3
10.       A national recovery plan of this kind should be based on thefollowing:a. A decision now to introduce overall import quotas formanufactured goods to be set at levels that permitted us tosurvive without the loan if we had to do so.b. The immediate introduction of import deposits to cover the interim period between the enforcement of the import quotasand their full implementation.c. The immediate enforcement of exchange controls to check speculative outflows, to be buttressed by special arrangementsnegotiated for the official holders of sterling to guarantee themagainst loss.d. The reintroduction of a Capital Issues Committee togetherwith arrangements for the control of tank advances to guarantee that investment did not take place in areas that did not rate as anational priority, thus helping to channel funds into projects thatwould have become attractive because import controls would providea secure home market.e. A lower interest rate for all but the official holders of sterling, to give a secondary incentive to investment and employment which would cut the PSBR by lowering debt interest payments,reduce unemployment and underpin our industrial strategy.f. Strengthen our industrial legislation by taking reserve powers to introduce planning agreements and by providing morefunds for the National Enterprise Board and the Scottish and WelshDevelopment Agencies.THE PROBLEMS OF IMPLEMENTATION11.       Given the abandonment of our existing economic strategy the change to a new one would be difficult whichever of the two roads above weadopted.    To that extent the alternative strategy could be presented as having been adopted only after all other policies had been tried.12.       Given the degree of international interdependence that exists ourclear objective should be to persuade the IMF, the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade (GATT) and tne European Economic Community (e.c.)that this is the right course for Britain and one that they should support forthe four or five year period necessary to allow us to re-industrialise somat we can emerge strong again at the end.4
13.       Wo should therefore boldly tell them that this is the policy we intend to adopt and seek a loan to assist its success and reduce the severity of the measures which would otherwise be necessary which wouldreflect themselves in internal sacrifice and an even tougher importrestriction.    We could explain that our level of import penetration would depend upon their readiness to give such assistance, and that such assistance would benefit them to the extent that it allows us higher levels of imports from their countries than would otherwise be possible.14.       Similarly at home we should present the strategy boldly as astrategy for national recovery upon the basis of which we would feelentitled to seek co-operation and to invite the acceptance of theconsequences that would flow from it.15.       I would not suggest that we hammered the term &quot;sacrifice&quot; norurge people to &quot;face the harsh truth&quot;, because there are many of our people for whom the sacr?flces are already real and the &quot;harsh truths&quot;have become commonplace in the leading articles of Conservativenewspapers.16.       Our approach should be based upon the belief that the interests ofthis country, short term, mid term and long term, require us to findthrough economic, industrial and political reforms, a way of using ourenormous skill and ability more constructively and productively than ourpresent inadequate political industrial and economic structures allow.It is a reform programme too and unless that element is introduced into it it would appear that it involves another hackneyed appeal for people tobuckle down in order to prop up an unfair and undemocratic economic system from which they did not benefit fully when it worked, which has caused suffering for them when it failed, and which even if it could bemade to work again would involve further sacrifice b without any guaranteeat the end that these sacrifices would pay off in a fairly shared distributionof benefit or power.17.       Such an appeal to the British people would have certain clear merits.First it would be based upon an industrial strategy that we left to ourselvesbelieve is right, and would only be abandoning under pressure from theinternational financial community.    Secondly it is a strategy for whichthere is already great support in the Labour and trade union movementwhich we ourselves created before, during and after the 1974 GeneralElection.    Thirdly it would be built upon values and ideas that the labour movement has developed and cherished over a much longer period than that.Fourthly it would appeal to all those who are not of our political persuasion,but who already sense that Britain&apos;s basic interests are being sacrificedunder international pressure which also is being used to humiliate us bylending money in return for the surrender of basic rights of national self-determination.5
18,       It is a programme that does not require us to adopt a posture orstance of confrontation against anybody, since it invites all to work together - managers as well as unions, industrialists as well asprofessional people.    It is an invitation for a new consensus without which no modem industrial society can work.CONCLUSION19.       I do not wish to underestimate the difficulties of making the choiceset out in paragraphs 8-10 above, but colleagues who dissent from this viewshould not underestimate either the difficulties of adopting a line enforcedupon us by the Fund,20.      Either way we shall have to confront obstacles and face someerosion of support until it la seen that the policy choice we have made is working, and as a Government so finely balanced in Parliamentary termswe cannot be certain how we will fare,21.       At least the alternative strategy can be seen to be firmly based ona belief in our own people&apos;s capacity to use their skill if the structurespermit them to do so.   At least the long road might be seen to be ending.At least we would be counting those who create the wealth as assets, not as human units to be dispensed with as a by-product of imposed cuts on social services or necessary sacrifices as a flood of imports engulf us,22,      The alternative strategy is already accepted by many in ourmovement and can touch and stir those who have never thought of us beforeas defenders of the British people,23.       But if we are not seen to be defending our interests we cannot aspireto the national leadership which two General Elections have placed in our hands to exercise for the benefit of al2,24,      Since the choice we are being asked to make is of such magnitudeI recommend to my colleagues that no decision be made until we have hadthe opportunity of discussing the alternatives, in conditions of confidentiality,including the ones set out in this paper, with the responsible leaders of theTrades Union Congress and the Labour Party.a w bDepartment of Energy29 November 19766
