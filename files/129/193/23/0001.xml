DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT81CP(76) 133 COPY NO14 December 1976CABINETWINDSCALE:  NUCLEAR WASTE PROPOSALMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment, I have before me a planning application submitted by British NuclearFuels Limited (BNFL) for the development of nuclear reprocessingfacilities at Wind scale.    The application has been considered by theCumbria County Council who have resolved that they are &quot;minded to approve the application&quot; but have referred it to me as a major departure from theCounty development plan.    This is because the application raises major issues of national importance which the Council have rightly decided theyare not competent to resolve.    I now have to decide whether or not to callin the application for a formal inquiry.2. The question was considered at the Ministerial Committee on Energyon 24 November, but the main question was not resolved and I was invitedto consider it further, including different possible ways in which an inquirycould be held, and the likelihood of delays involved.    My colleagues majorconcern was that delay might put at risk the contract for the reprocessing of japanese uranium oxide fuel and damage our international reputation inthis field.    The attached paper sets out the results of my caonsiderations and my views on the type of inquiry that would be most suitable,3. I have given this matter full and careful coneideration.    In my view it would be inconceivable for an issue of this importance not to be thesubject of a planning inquiry.    Xa all conscience I do not see how we could proceed otherwise,4.        There is legitimate and growing public concern over thereprocessing of uranium oxide fuel; the recent unfortunate leakage ofradioactive material at Wind scale has inevitably added to this concern.In my view it is essential to make an early announcement that the Wind scaleapplication will be the subject of an inquiry.    This will enable theenvironmental and safety issues at stake to be properly and responsiblyconsidered.1
5, I therefore seek my colleagues&apos; agreement to the making of suchan announcement.p department of the Environment14 December 19762
(confidential)wind scale - NUCLEAR WASTE PROPOSALSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment.    On 24 November the Ministerial Committee on Energy (ENM)considered a memorandum from me in which I proposedthat the planning application from British Nuclear Fuel Ltd(BNFL) in respect of certain nuclear waste reprocessingfacilities at&quot; wind scale should be called in.   The Committeewere divided and I was therefore asked to consider again thedesirability of calling in the application and, if so, alternative means by which a decision on the application itself might bereached . .2.    Background.Earlier this year BNFL made application to the Cumbria CountyCouncil for planning permission for the development of nuclearreprocessing facilities at wind scale.   This was a single application(a point to which I return later) but the proposed developmentseffectively fall into three parts:i. improved arrangements for handling and reprocessingirradiated Magnox fuel;ii. development of a pilot demonstration plant forvitrifying long-lived radioactive waste;iii. new facilities for reprocessing uranium oxide fuelboth from the current generation of UK Advanced GasCooled Reacters (AGR&apos;s), and from overseas.3.   When the County Planning Committee considered the applicationon 2 November they resolved that they were &quot;minded to approve theapplication&quot; but decided to refer it to me as a major departure from their development plan.    In doing so they have in effect,placed responsibility for the final decision on me.4.   ENM have already agreed that there is every advantage in allowing the first two parts of the application to proceed.   this can be done by inviting BNFL to withdraw their single application and to resubmit it in separate parts.   Where there wasdisagreement in ENM was as to whether the application foruranium oxide plant should be called in, and be subject to an inquiry.(confidential)1
(confidential)5.    I have given -the matter considerable further thought, andI remain firmly of the view that some form of public inquiry-is essential before the construction of the uranium oxide plantcan be permitted.6     There is increasing public anxiety about the safety and possiblyenvironmental effects of the technology involved in the reprocess!^of uranium oxide fuel on the scale proposed.    The recently discover6leakage of radio-active material from one of the existing magnoatsilos installations at wind scale can only add to this concern.Sir Brian Flowers, until recently Chairman of the Royal Commissionon Environmental Pollution, has urged that the planning application should be called in.7     Unless the public can be provided with some real reassuranceabout the nature and safety of the proposed development at V/indsca*e&apos;opposition to nuclear programmes will increase to a point wherethere may be strong political pressure against further developments of any kind.    I am therefore convinced that some form of public inquiry should be undertaken.    I realise that there is a risk that the establishment of an inquiry would cause the loss of the 400m Japanese contract for the reprocessing of nuclear fuel, so the more speedily the inquiry can be undertaken the better.Form of inquiry8     1 have examined a number of different means of holding an inquiry, and I have concluded that I have two basic options fromwhich to choose - a non-statutory committee of investigation or a normal planning inquiry,A non-statutory committee, of investigation9     If BNFL in submitting fresh planning applications were to offli*the proposal for the uranium oxide plant, and ad hoc committee of investigation could be established, conducted by some knowledgeable ^and respected figures, into the safety and environmental implicateof the proposed operations,    if the report were sufficiently       ,reassuring and BNFL then submitted their application for the urani^oxide plant, I would feel justified in not calling it in,10   The advantage of operating by way of a non-statutory investingwould be that the terms of reference could be directed to the issUfc;which cause most public concern (and which transcend the local       eplanning consideration) and the procedure might be more rapid, sinit would not be necessary to comply with statutory requirements for planning inquiries.11    I would instruct the investigating panel to have its report      eready in about 6 months.   However, the disadvantage with this coursis that if the report were equivocal I would be in much the same position 6 months hence that I am in now, and I would have no alternative but to call in the application for a statutoryenquiry.    I might also be criticised for attempting to&apos;&quot;short ci^cthe statutory procedures.(confidential)
(confidential)Statutory enquiry12   The other option is to arrange for BNFL to withdraw the presentapplication, resubmit 3 separate ones for the 3 components of thepresent application, and then call in for a public enquiry theone which relates to the facilities for reprocessing uraniumoxide.    I estimate that it would take 9-12 months before a decision could be announced.   A variant of this option v/ould be to establish a Planning Inquiry Commission (PIC) which might be more appropriate to the particular issues which the wind scale case raises.   many people have asked for this on the grounds that it would be amuch better method of considering the wide range of issues givingcause for public concern.    But a PIC is an untried procedure andby its very nature would be likely to prolong things still further.Conclusion13   In my view there is no question that some form of enquiry mustbe held.    Of the two main options described above, I favour thesecond - immediate call in, followed by as rapid a public local inquiry(rather than a PIC) as can be arranged.    I realise that this may&apos;risk the loss of the Japanese contract - although the extent ofthis risk is difficult to determine - hut I nevertheless believe it the right course.(confidential)
