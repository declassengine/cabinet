US DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY !S government cp(76)120 COPY NO    8129 November 1976CABINETDEVOLUTION: THE ENGLISH DIMENSIONMemorandum by the Lord President of the council. I attach, for the consideration of colleagues, the draft of a consultative document an devolution and England,    We are committed to publish this document before the Second Reading of the Scotland and WalesBill,2.        In accordance with instructions of the Ministerial Committee onDevolution Strategy (DVY) the draft document follows an analytical, non-committal approach.    It aims at avoiding unnecessary offence to any ofthe various groups of English opinion on whose support we shall have to rely in order to secure the passage of the Scotland and Wales Bill.    Forthe present this must be our primary objective,    whatever view we may take at a later stage about the need for changes in the structure ofgovernment in England, the present document is not the occasion forexpressing opinions or attempting to steer opinion in one direction ratherthan another.3.        The structure of the present draft was approved by DVY on26 November.    Beyond ruling out an English Assembly and regional assemblies with legislative powers - to both of which there are clear andpersuasive objections - the draft expresses no preference between anumber of forms of change which are described (Section IV),    These are presented as illustrations of the very wide range of possibilities which exists, depending on the particular combinations of powers and functions which new bodies would exorcise.   And in setting out factors which haveto be weighed when the practicability and acceptability of particularpossibilities of change is considered, the draft (Section V) deliberatelyavoids balancing the factors in relation to any particular possibility.4.        This form of presentation seems to me preferable in this particulardocument at this particular time to the possible alternative of taking three or four specific formulations of change and setting out the factorsreferable to each.    Such an approach can no doubt produce a more clear cut1
impression, but mat is what., on this occasion, it is better to avoid.Moreover, it lends to the particular formulations selected for discussionan immediacy and a plausibility which is not produced if the discussion ofthe factors to be weighed is kept on a general basis.5.        I believe that the approach in the draft will allow us the maximumfreedom of manoeuvre in the light of developments on the Scotland andWales Bill and in the course of the consultative process itself, includingthe possibility of a further more specific document should that becomee xpedient.6.        I invite my colleagues to approve the attached draft, subject onlyto any minor drafting amendments or corrections of errors which may befound desirable.    The intention is to publish it next week, probably on9 December.M FPrivy Council Office29 November 19762
(confidential)DEVOLUTION&apos;: THE ENGLISH DIMENSION - A CONSULTATIVE DOCUMENTfI       THE DEVOLUTION BACKGROUND j1.1   The Government have just published a Bill^ to give effect to theirdevolution proposals for Scotland and Wales.   The Bill provides for the creationof new bodies which will be directly elected by and answerable to people inScotland and Wales.1.2   The proposals for Scotland and Wales are complex.   The Government havealready been working on them for over two years.   They will now be closelyscrutinised by Parliament over a period of several months.1.3   The Government have always intended that their review of government arrange-ments in Great Britain should cover England also.   But consultations undertaken in the summer of 1974 showed not only much greater desire for change in Scotlandand Wales than in England but also a clearer view as to what form such change should take.1.4   The Government announced their preliminary conclusions for Scotland and wales in September 1974v 1 but made it clear that it would be premature to reach any conclusions about change in England until further consultations had been carriedout.   They decided subsequently to defer these further consultations until theycould be conducted against a background of firm proposals for Scotland and Wales.1.5   The purpose of the present document is to describe the main features of theproposals for Scotland and Wales, to discuss the main implications of theseproposals for England and to set out the factors to he taken into account in assess-ing the case for and against various possible changes in England.^The Scotland and Wales Bill, published on 30 November 1976^Democracy and Devolution: Proposals for Scotland and Wales: Cmnd 5732(confidential)
(confidential)1.6    Constitutional arrangements in the UK have developed over the years in a flexible way.   Northern Ireland had a separate Parliament from1920 to 1973.   Scotland has had its own Minister in the Government for manyyears with an increasing range of functions administered under his direc-tion by officials operating from Edinburgh and working in close contact with representative Scottish bodies.   Wales has had a similar though newerand less extensive system,   English arrangements have been different again,with a series of specialist Ministers directing functional departments,some of which have regional offices maintaining contact with the interests concerned with a particular   function in different parts of the country.The Scotland and Wales Bill does not relate in any way to the arrangementsfor administration in England and leaves the existing arrangements com-pletely untouched.1.7 This variety of constitutional arrangenents has contributed to the flexibility and responsiveness of government since it has been possible to devise machinery suited to the requirements of a particular function in aparticular part of the United Kingdom at a particular time, without having-to apply identical arrangements everywhere. Requirements will continue to vary after devolution. The Government see great advantage in avoiding theharmful effects of unnecessary standardisation.1.8    At this stage the Government do not themselves advocate any specificcourse of action in England.   The factors affecting England are singularly complex.   1It is important that they should be generally understood so that public discussion can be informed end illuminating.   In the light of such dis-cussion and any consensus which may result as to desirable change theGovernment will decide what proposals, if any, they ought to promote.(confidential)
(confidential)1.9     Subsequent sections of this paper deal with the constitutionalimplications for England of the proposals for Scotland and Wales; theirindustrial and economic    implications for England; the possibilities forchange in England; and the factors which have to be weighed in assessingsuch possibilities.   The final section deals with the consultative processand contains a list of questions on which views are invited.(confidential)
(confidential)II  -   ENGLAND AFTER DEVOLUTION - CONSTITUTIONAL IMPLICATIONS2.1  The English dimension of devolution has to be judged against the backgroundnot only of the continuing supreme authority of Parliament, but also of the formof the Government1 s proposals for Scotland and Wales.   It is clear, however,from comments made on the Governments devolution policy that widespreadmisunderstanding still exist about its purposes and effects.   Before consideringthe constitutional implications for England, therefore, this section brieflyrecapitulates the main features of the devolution policy.2. 2 The Government see devolution to Scotland and Wales as a means of enabling   ^the domestic affairs of these two parts of the United Kingdom, with theirdistinctive national traditions, to be administered in closer accordance with thewishes of the people living there.   Many of these matters are alreadyadministered by the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales.   Devolution willcomplement this administrative decentralisation with separate politicalaccountability direct to the Scottish and Welsh electorates, and will also reduce faepresent pressures on parliamentary time. The Government believe that the unifiedstructure of the United Kingdom can accommodate these new institutions.2. 3 In devising their devolution schemes the Government have sought to identify the areas of activity where decisions affect primarily people living in scotland or Wales.   They consider it important not to devolve to either Assembly powers over activities which substantially affect people living elsewhere or the well-being of the United Kingdom generally.2.4 In relation to the matters to be devolved the new administrations will inheritthe executive powers that Ministers now exercise.   In addition, having regardto the separate system of law in Scotland and the existence of separateinstitutions and policies in many of the activity areas concerned, the scottish assembly will have powers to legislate on most of the devolved matters.2. 5 Devolution will not, however, aXlect the supreme authority of parliament and its ability to make laws on any subpct for the whole of the United kingdom or any part of it.   Apart from this the Government and Parliament will continue(confidential)
(confidential)to be directly concerned with a wide range of important matters in Scotlandand Wales - for example, general industrial and economic policies (discussed insection 111^ social security, the major nationalised industries, the regiation of ccmmsrce,the preservation of law and order.   The Government will also have a general power to intervene, subject to parliamentary approval, where action by adevolved administration or a failure to act, threatens to prejudice an interest for which the Government and Parliament have retained responsibility.2. 6 It might be argued that in the interests of equal treatment between Englandand Scotland there should be an English Assembly, separate from Parliament,       ^for business (including legislation) corresponding with that to be devolved inScotland.   The Government firmly believe, however, that establishing such an assembly for England could damage the structure of the United Kingdom inways which the creatior. of a Scottish Assembly would not.2. 7 It would not be appropriate for Parliament to act both as the legislaturefor the United Kingdom as a whole and also as the domestic legislature for ).Wales and Northern Ireland but not for England or Scotland.   In practice, if ian English Assembly was established, Parliaments role would have to be jjrestricted to a limited range of matters.   Four separate Assemblies would be rrequired in the four countries of the United Kingdom, each with its own Executive,   ii2, 8 This would amount in practice to a form of federation - a system which was rejected by the Kilbrandon Commission^.   The Government believe that a ;federal system would not fit the essential character of the United Kingdom as a union of four distinctive national components of very different sizes;  and thatit would not be compatible, in the particular circumstances of the United Kingdom,   &apos;:.with the close economio unity required to meet national needs and publicexpectations of social parity.   England contains almost 85 per cent of thepopulation with a correspondingly overwhelming proportion of resources.   No existing federation contains a partner of anything like thispreponderance.   An English Assembly representing such a large population could hardly avoid becoming a rival to Parliament, particularly if the two bodies were^  Report of the Royal Commission on the Constitution (1969-73) Cmnd 5460(confidential)
(confidential)under the control of opposing parties.   And because the expenditure needs ofthe English Assembly would represent such a large part of total programmes,particularly awkward relationships would exist in relation to taxation, resourceallocation, regional planning and comparable issues.   These difficulties would affect the relationships between Parliament and the three other Assemblies also.2. 9 The setting up of an English Assembly on the lines proposed for scotland would, compared with the consequences of a Scottish Assembly, involve an enormous diminution of the role of Parliament and its Members.   This might bereduced to industrial, economic and financial matters, defence and foreign ^affairs.   The role of central government would be similarly truncated, althoughreserve powers in the devolved fields would be needed to carry out our international obligations and to deal with e.c. matters generally.2.10 For these reasons, the establishment of an English Assembly would carrygrave risks to the continuing political and economic unity of the United Kingdom,the preservation of which the Government have regarded as a firm principle which should govern the proposals for Scotland and Wales. tSome  people  have  proposed  a  series  of regional  assemblies  instead.    . - fBut regional assemblies with legislative powers would mean that the legislativeframework for such matters as education, health, housing, local government and land use would be largely determined at regional level leading to possibly ,marked differences over short distances within England.   The Government there-     ^fore rule out from further consideration not only the creation of an EnglishAssembly but also a series of regional assemblies with legislative powers.2,11 Other possible regional arrangements are considered in Sections IV and V,(confidential)
(confidential)III.  ENGLAND AFTER DEVOLUTION TO SCOTLAND AND WALES -INDUSTRIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS3, 1 Much public comment in England has been concerned with the industrial and economic implications of the Governments proposals for Scotland andWales.   Fears have been expressed that devolution will lead to an accretionof powers and influence to the devolved administrations of a kind likelyto prejudice the interests of England and, more particularly, the leasprosperous regions of England. These fears are, in fact, groundless. &apos;3. 2 The devolution which is being proposed for Scotland and Wales relates 1to matters which primarily affect people living in Scotland and Wales and &apos;which can be administered separately in either country without side-effectsfor those living in the rest of the United Kingdom.   The Government have made J(4) Iclearv &apos; that their proposals are designed not to infringe the economic unity [jof the United Kingdom.   This economic unity has many important aspects. they include not only external economic relations, the management of demand jiiin the United Kingdom as a whole and the framework of trade, but also thetask of devising national policies to benefit particular parts of the UnitedKingdom and of distributing resources among them according to relative need.Regional policies3, 3 The main purpose of regional policies is to promote investment andemployment in those parts of the country which experience persistently above-average levels of unemployment.   Such policies cannot be dealt with inI (4)   Part II of our Changing Democracy:   Devolution to Scotland andI Wales (Cmnd 6348)^ (confidential)
(confidential)isolation from other national economic policies.   They must be formulatedand implemented for Britain as a whole so that priorities can be judgedfairly and the resources of the whole country deployed to help solveproblems as they arise anywhere within it.   Accordingly the Government willcontinue after devolution to Scotland and Wales to determine in which partsof Great Britain economic conditions and prospects justify assisted areastatus and what forms of relief or incentive are to be available to establishedor incoming employers.   And the Government will remain responsible for &apos;industrial development certificate policy which assists the steering of new industrial development to the assisted areas.3. 4 Regional policies are concerned both with the provision of regionalfinancial aids to employers and with public investment designed to eliminate j.jdeficiencies in the infrastructure and the amenities of the less prosperousareas.ii 5 At present the three main regional incentives to industry are regional development Grants and Regional Selective Assistance (both of which areincentives to capital investment) and Regional Employment Premium (whichassists with labour costs and is a continuing aid available to establishedfirms). In addition, much of the selective assistance provided under Section 8of the Industry Act, for example under the Accelerated Projects Scheme and special Industry Schemes, on a national basis is in fact given to investment projects in the assisted areas.   All these systems of aid are administered by departments of central government; and responsibility for their administration will remain with central government after devolution to Scotland and Wales.(confidential)
(confidential)3. 6 Infrastructure development is for the main part in the hands nut of thecentral government itself but of local authorities and public corporations.However, the Government influences priorities, firstly in the settling of thepublic expenditure programmes for the various services and secondly in the granting of capital expenditure authorisations or approvals to borrow.3. 7 The Government will retain responsibility after devolution to Scotlandand Wales for a number of important forms of infrastructure which form partof a national network - such as railways and ports.   Other forms which are more closely related to local needs - for example, housing, roads, watersupply and sewerage - will come under the aegis of the devolved administrationsbut will normally be provided by local authorities or public corporations,in some cases with financial assistance from the block funds paid to the devolved administrations.   Certain types of environmental improvement   -notably redevelopment and clearance of derelict land - may be carried outby the recently created Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies usingresources put at their disposal by the devolved administrations from the wider resources provided for all devolved purposes.Pimance3. 8 The arrangements for financing devolved services were explained in the White Paper of November 1975    .   (They have since been modified by withdrawal of the proposal for an optional surcharge on local rates^. )^ Our Changing Democracy: Devolution to Scotland and Wales (Cmnd 6348)^  Devolution to Scotland and Wales: Supplementary Statement (Cmnd 6585)(confidential)
(confidential)The essential feature is that there will be a block fund for each administration which will take account both of local needs and of the desirability of someuniformity of standards in all parts of the United Kingdom.   These funds will bevoted by Parliament.   At the same time a limit will be laid down for the totalamounts to be authorised by the devolved administrations for developmentsfinanced by long term borrowing (eg most capital investment by localauthorities).   Once these two totals have been settled it will be for the devolvedadministrations to determine the detailed distribution between the services for which they are responsible.   The Government will continue to determineexpenditure on the services which remain their own responsibility - whetherthroughout the United Kingdom, for the whole of Great Britain, for Englandand Wales or in England alone.3. 9 The settlement of the block funds and the borrowing limits will be closely linked with the annual public expenditure review carried out by the Government.This settles spending programmes for the coming year and outline programmes for three further years ahead.   The devolved administrations will be involvedin this process.  The block funds will be settled by the Government subject to theapproval of Parliament, and normally, it is expected with the agreement of the devolved administrations.3. 10  No neat formula is capable of producing fair shares of public expenditure for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in varying circumstancesfrom year to year; this requires both sensitive political judgment and information about relative ne^ds and standards.(confidential)
(confidential)The Government have already begun work on the scope for improving the base o  objective information relevant to the devolved services; and they intend to discuss with the devolved administrations, once they are established,ways and means of achieving this.   The objective is to ensure justice to theclaims of all parts of the United Kingdom and to make it easier to demonstrate that justice has been done.3. 11  Once fixed, the block funds will not necessarily remain unchanged, /If national economic factors make it desirable in any year to supplementagreed public expenditure programmes, the block funds will be supplementedin the same way as the votes of the central government departments responsiblefor the services concerned.   Similarly, if forecast public expenditure has tobe reduced for national economic reasons the block funds will bear theirfair share of the cuts.   The limits on capital expenditure to be financed by borrowing will also be subject to adjustment as necessary.Development Agencies3. 12  As well as engaging in environmental improvements the scottish and Welsh Development Agencies provide factories and industrial estatesand have powers of industrial investment similar to those which areexercisable by the National Enterprise Board throughout the  United Kingdom.The Agencies are not responsible for regional selective assistance unlessthe Secretary of State specifically directs them to handle a particularapplication, in which case he lays down in detail the basis on which assistance is to be offered and provides the necessary funds.(confidential)
(confidential)3. 13  After devolution both Agencies will be financed from the resources available for the devolved administrations and will operate subject to directionby them.   As far as industrial investment functions are concerned, however,the administrations will be required to ensure compliance with guidelineslaid down by the territorial Sec retary of State concerned.   These guidelineswill be incorporated in statutory instruments which can be annulled byParliament.   As a result of the guidelines the Agencies will continue to operate on a commercial basis and their powers will not be used to provide&quot;soft&quot; loans or other forms of subsidy   (except for the schemes for smallgrants to rural industries previously administered by the Small IndustriesCouncil for Rural Areas of Scotland or, in Wales, by the Council for SmallIndustries in Rural Areas).   Similarly the Agencies will not be empowered to dispose of factories or industrial sites on terms more favourable than thosewhich the English Industrial Estates Corporation   has to operate.   consultation and collaboration between the Agencies and the National Enterprise board will continue.3, 14  The Agencies will continue to have no powers to deal with applicationsfor regional selective assistance unless directed to do so by the Secretary ofState in a particular case.   When a direction is given the Secretary of state will lay down the basis for any offer of assistance and will provide the necessary funds.(confidential)
(confidential)3.15     The Agencies will have to present annual reports to Parliament,covering the functions which are subject to guidelines and any cases where theyhave been directed to handle applications for regional selective assistance.No doubt these reports will be carefully scrutinised by Members representingother parts of the United Kingdom.3.16     Some people believe that English interests would benefit if there were an English Development Agency with a remit similar to that of the Scottish and welsh Agencies or, alternatively, that there should be a series of regional development Agencies in England with similar powers.   Some of the main factors, for and against, are set out below to assist the discussion.3.17      The case which is made for development agencies is that they bringtogether in a single cohesive organisation various forms of developmentalsupport which would otherwise be channelled through a number of separateorganisations.   A comprehensive approach to industrial development andpromotion is therefore greatly facilitated and, when necessary, action canbe taken speedily and flexibly.3.18     On the other hand, the functions of the Scottish and Welsh DevelopmentAgencies are already carried out in England, by different means.   Forexample, factories and industrial estates are made available on a similar basis in the English assisted areas by the English Industrial Estates Corporation,while the Development Commission helps rural areas whether within or withoutthe assisted areas.   The industrial development functions of the Agencies are carried out in England by the N ational Enterprise Board;   to develop itsawareness of regional needs the Board has established offices in Liverpool andNewcastle.   And the environmental improvement powers of the Agencies areexerciseable by local authorities.   There is no clear evidence that these variousfunctions would be more effectively carried out if merged together, or that local authorities would welcome a change in the present arrangements inrelation to such matters as derelict land clearance.i(confidential)
(confidential)3,19     Furthermore, it is doubtful whether a single English Agency,having to co-ordinate a range of environmental and industrial functions in the differing circumstances of assisted areas which are spread fromCornwall to Northumbria, would be accepted as having the closefamiliarity with the problems of particular areas which is looked for from the Scottish and Welsh Agencies.   On the other hand, if a number of regional development agencies were established it would be necessary toavoid the risk of wasteful competition between them in order to attractindustrial investment and employment, /3. 20     These factors have so far been judged to tip the balance ofadvantage against an English Agency or Agencies,   But the government do not rule out these suggestions and, indeed, would welcome furtherviews on them.Summing up3,21     In brief, the position concerning industrial and economic powers,after devolution to Scotland and Wales, will be that:-a.   the Government will retain direct control over economicmanagement and over regional policy, industrial policy and commercial policy;
(confidential)b. the Government and Parliament will retain direct control overthe allocation of block funds to the devolved administrations and ov erthe total of capital expenditure financed by borrowing which theymay authorise;c. the Government will lay down statutory guidelines to control theindustrial investment operations of the Scottish and Welsh DevelopmentAgencies.3. 22  These powers will be exercised by the Government with a view to ensuring that industrial investment is &quot;steered&quot; to the assisted areas and thatresources continue to be allocated to the different countries of the United kingdom in accordance with needs.   Both England and Northern Ireland will continueto receive their fair shares of resources after devolution; and, in exercising their responsibilities within England, the Government intend to secure fairnessfor all the different parts.   There is, in their view, no reason to suppose thatthe devolution proposed for Scotland and Wales will in any way prejudice theeconomic prospects of any part of England.3.2 3 The Government will keep their regional policies under review, havingregard to the changing circumstances of the national economy.   They willcontinue to give a high priority to stimulating industrial investment andemployment in the assisted areas, whether in England, Scotland, Wales oror Agencies, or any other innovation if it can be shown to offer good prospectsNorthern Ireland.   They are prepared to consider an English Development agency of success in achieving these objectives.
(confidential)IV    POSSIBILITIES FOR CHANGE BT ENGLAND4.1     Change in England could take various forms, not all of which amountto &quot;devolution&quot;.   As used in the Scottish and Welsh context devolutionmeans the transfer of powers from a central authority.   Changes in the structure of government in England would constitute &quot;devolution&quot; only ifthey involved some transfer of powers from central government to a lower level.4.2    Discussion of the scope for change in the structure of EnglishGovernment has, however, extended more widely than this.   It has embracedalso the whole question of the relationship between Wftteha.il and the localauthorities! the structure and financing of local government; the alloca-tion of functions between different levels of local government; the role ofnominated bodies; and the arguments for and against an enhanced role forgovernment at the regional level.4*3     In considering the implications for England of the proposals forScotland and Wales it is useful to have these issues in mind, but not all ofthem have direct relevance to devolution.   For example, the case for changein the structure and functions of local government in England - essentially the present counties   and districts - has no necessary connection withdevolution.   It is an issue in its own right.4*4    Possible changes that have been suggested in the structure of govern-ment in England can be considered in two groups, described below as &quot;radical1change and &quot;limited&quot; change.   The factors to be weighed in any assessment of these proposals are discussed in Section V.
(confidential)Radical change4.5    Into this group fall various forms of new regional elected authorities with executive powers.   Their nature, and their relationship to existing authorities, could vary very widely, depending on, among&apos; other things, the source of their powers; their system of finance; their range of functions;and their number, size and boundaries.    The particular forms described inthe following paragraphs are no more than illustrations drawn from aspectrum of possibilities.4.6 The overriding constitutional and parliamentary objections to aseries of elected regional assemblies with powers to legislate on theScottish pattern have already been considered in paragraph 2.10.4*7    There remains however the possibility of creating a series of electedregional assemblies, with the ability to exercise functions in specifiedfields at present carried out by the central government.   If these bodiesfollowed the pattern proposed for the Welsh Assembly, the administrativepolicy in such matters as education, health, housing, highways, watersupply, local government and land use would be largely determined atregional level.   Appropriate financial provision would have to be made,possibly by way of some form of block fund; and a substantial number ofstaff would be needed to enable the assemblies to carry out their decisions.Devolution to bodies of this kind would enable domestic affairs and priori-ties to be decided and administered at regional level.4*8    A second major possibility would involve not so much the devolution of central government powers, but rather the creation of elected regionalbodies drawing their powers from local government and nominated bodies suchas the water authorities and health service authorities.   It has beenargued,that there should be about a dozen directly elected regional
(rnwFinPMTiAi ^authorities which might he responsible for planning, infrastructuredevelopment, and community land, water :md ceverage, health and economic planning functions; these might be accompanied by V-sulti-purpose1 districtauthorities whose responsibilities might include housing, education,social services and other major functions below the regional tier.4*9     The establishment of elected regional authorities would thus amount in practice to a comprehensive reorganisation of local government.   Thepresent two-tier structure could not sensibly be combined with a thirdelected &quot;local&quot; tier.   Many functions of the counties would therefore need      &apos;to be raised to the new regional authorities and others would be transferredto the districts.   This would require a substantial reorganisation of thedistrict authorities most of which would have to be enlarged in order to handletheir new responsibilities.   The regional authorities would require majorsources of finance and staff.
(confidential)Limited change4.10     Limited changes in governmental arrangements in the regionscould involve alterations to existing regional bodies or some adjustments to local government, or both.4.11      At the regional level, proposals have been advanced for more effective regional advisory bodies.   The present non-elected Regional economic planning Councils already bring together a wide range of interests within eachregion, including local government and industry.   But it is argued that the regions should somehow be given a clearer voice, without involving substantial ^changes in the structure of government in England.4,12     Strengthened regional advisory bodies would exist primarily torepresent regional interests to central government and advise on regional needs.They might be based on the Economic Planning Councils, whose role could been larged to encompass a wider range of central and local government interests.Members might continue all to be appointed;   or some might be appointed andothers elected indirectly by members of local authorities in the region.   bodies of this kind, without executive powers, would not be large spenders and could operate with small staffs.4,13     The development of advisory machinery on these lines might be accompanied by increasing the representation of central departments in the regions and by improving interdepartmental liaison machinery there so that the regional advisory body could work in close co-operation with the officialscarrying out executive duties.   In this way central departments would be moreaccessible to regional interests and better informed about local circumstances.This could result in better decision making without altering the responsibilities of Ministers or their accountability to Parliament.4.14     There are also options for limited change at the local government level.Wholesale reorganisation of the present structure may not be the only approach.
(confidential)An alternative might be to examine the present framework lo identifyits strengths and weaknesses, and to see what improvements could be made without tearing up local government by its roots.   To embark, in short,on a process of local government reform.4.15     The elements which could be considered under this approach includethe following:a. Functions.   There has been a good deal of criticism of thedistribution of functions within the present two-tier system,including for example the functional relationship between districts ^and counties in the metropolitan areas, the division of planningpowers between counties and districts generally and the extentof the various powers held concurrently by both tiers.   The problems which have arisen under the 1974 structure do not affect all areasin the same way.   A reform approach could start with a review ofthe tiers at which local authority functions are performed;desirable changes could take place selectively and if necessary with different patterns in different parts of the country.b. Boundaries.   Changes in functions may call for changes inboundaries.   In addition, there will be a case in some areas foradjusting boundaries either because they were unsatisfactorily set by the 1974 reorganisation, or because developments since then havemade change desirable,c*    Ad hoc combinations of local authorities to tackle particular problems, where there is a clear need;  wide-ranging powers for joint working already exist under the Local Government Act 1972.d.   The scope for democratising nominated bodies, such aswater authorities, could also be examined.4.16     It would first be necessary to identify and evaluate the deficiencies in the 1974 structure.   This consultative process may form the starting point forsuch an evaluation; leading to consideration of the scope for makingimprovements and the proper timescale for change of this kind.(confidential)
(confidential)V      THE FACTORS TO EE WEIGHS5.1   Many factors, both of general public acceptability and of administrativefeasibility, are involved in consideration of the various forms of change outlined in Section IV .5.2   Before coming to their own conclusions the Government consider it essentialto obtain as broadly based as possible an impression of the views of the publicon these matters.   They wish to establish whether existing institutions are regarded as deficient, and if so, how far and in what ways.   To assist publicconsideration of possible changes this Section sets out the case for change anddraws attention io some of the main factors which have to be taken into account in .assessing what changes may be practicable.The Case for Change5.3   The case for change in the structure of government in England has been arguedon a number of different grounds, the main features of which can be summarised asfollows:-a. That the central machinery of government - Parliament, Ministers and 0Whitehall Departments - would be more efficient if it could concentrate on matters of genuinely national importance.   Ministers and Departments   areat present overloaded by concern with too much administrative detail andwith matters which could with more efficiency and sensitivity be handledlocally.   The establishment of assemblies in Scotland and Wales should accordingly be followed up by some corresponding lightening of the pressures on the central government machine in relation to England.b. That the decisions and processes of central government are too remotefrom the ordinary citizen.   Taking more decisions at a level nearer to theindividual would ensure that local knowledge and interests were more fully J:taken into account and would stimulate participation in local affairs.(confidenxial)
(confidential)c. That important nominate &amp; bcdies, such as water and health authorities whose operations affect daily living conditions and bearclosely on services provided by elected local authorities, should besubject to local democratic control.     Either the functions of such bodies should be transferred to elected authorities or. if the bodies are to be retained, their members should be elected locally and notappointed by Ministers.d. That there is a need for a layer of government to handle functions which would be better dealt with in a context smaller than the whole        &apos;country but larger than the existing local authorities.   Even after the1974 reorganisation of local government the new local authorities covertoo small an area for the exercise of strategic planning responsibilities and -their boundaries are too tightly drawn to facilitate the rehousingand redevelopment programmes needed in some of the larger cities.   Thepresent division of responsibilities between the county and districtlevels is not seen as the best available.7The Framework for Change5.4    All these arguments for change place varying degrees of emphais on theextent to which the over-riding criterion should be that of more efficient administration or more locally responsive government - two desiderata whichmay not always be reconcilable.   In considering what changes may be practic-able, and in balancing the benefits gained by each with additional problems which might be created at the same time, it is necessary to take account ofthe constitutional, financial and other constraints that form the framework within which any restructuring of government in England must take place.   Theseare considered in the following paragraphs. 3;
^TSiKIPini^MTBAI ^V   V^^M^ I       I    I tm&quot; Ik. I  *    I    fit   -\Umrn jConstitutional imuli cat ions5.5     Thp framework in which any re-structuring of government in England hasto he considered must clearly take account of tho limits imposed both &quot;bythe need to preserve the political and economic unity of the united Kingdom,which the overwhelming majority of people plainly desire, and by the imprac-practicability of federalism in the circumstances of the United Kingdom.5.6    But even while remaining within these constraints, some institutionalchanges would still creats major problems.   In particular, a system of regional assemblies with executive powers derived from central governmentwould have far-reaching effects on the present structure of ministerial and parliamentary responsibilities, under which Ministers have responsibilityfor the development of policies and determination of priorities but areaccountable to Parliament for their decisions and actions.5.7     The transfer to elected English regional bodies of powers at presentexercised by Ministers (whether at a departmental headquarters or in a regional office) would have far-reaching constitutional implications.   Inparticular it could directly reduce their ability to maintain national policies on devolved subjects and the role of Parliament and the scope ofits Members.   If regional authorities were able to determine the allocation of resources to particular programmes within their regions (and without thisability the exercise of their powers would in practice be severely restricted)this would fundamentally affect the ability of Ministers to accountseparately and collectively to Parliament for the policies, standards andpriarities of the services they administer.it-t,(confidential)
(confidential)5.8       Major organisational change, whether involving devolution of central government functions or the reorganisation of local governmentwould produce serious administrative problems.   It would involve thecreation of major new units of administration and an inevitable need for substantial numbers of extra staff.   While it is not practicable to putspecific costs to the changes the creation of, say, a dozen regional authorities with powers similar to those of the Welsh Assembly wouldinvolve thousands of additional staff and additional costs, probably runninginto hundreds of millions of pounds.5. 9       The more limited forms of change would not carry the majorconstitutional implications associated with regional assemblies or authorities, and they would not involve the disruption and cost associatedwith major comprehensive reorganisation.   Limited reform of localgovernment might therefore be the most practicable approach to the short-comings of local government structure.5.10     However, such an approach carries its own dangers.   It would bedesirable to define as clearly as possible in advance the extent of the changes to be aimed at and the circumstances in which particular changes would becontemplated.   Without this, a great deal of the existing organisation belowthe level of central government could be affected by uncertainties, and this might hinder forward planning and efficient administration.Financial Implications5.11      Regional assemblies would call for entirely new financial relationships.These bodies would be free, subject to statutory obligations, to allocateresources amongst the services for which they were responsible and developdistinctive policies based on their own view of regional priorities.   Some wouldargue that this power to allocate resources should also extend to all services provided by the local authorities within the region.(confidential)
(confidential)5.12     It would in theory be possible to pay each regional assembly a block fund as is proposed for Scotland and Wales.   It is inherent in such asystem that the Government&apos;s influence over priorities between servicesand the ability of Ministers to determine national policies and expenditure programmes would be reduced.   Indeed some would argue that this would bedesirable.   In relation to their own directly administered services the regionsthemselves would settle programmes for large populations and wide areas;and in relation to services administered by local authorities they would ensure that regional priorities were followed (as distinct from national ones,where these differed).5.13     Such block funds would make the Government1 s task of economicmanagement more difficult.   The composition of expenditure is importantbecause different types of expenditure have different effects on importanteconomic aggregates such as the balance of payments, the public sectorborrowing requirement and unemployment as well as different effects on thevarious sectors of the economy.   It is true that the Government will notcontrol the composition of expenditure on devolved services in Scotland andWales.   But to extend this relaxation of control to every region in Englandwould have much larger effects, and would make it vastly more difficult forthe Government tc exercise its essential functions in managing the economy ofthe United Kingdom as a whole.(confidential)
(confidential)fioundari es5&apos;14 Any study of possible regional institutions of government in England must take account of the problem of defining the areas over which they would opprate.The number of the regions, and their boundaries, would need to reflect a balance between administrative efficiency, in terms of the functions for which theywould be responsible; the facts of geography; and historical loyalties andtraditions.   In some places - at Newcastle or Manchester, for example - there i3clearly a sense of regional awareness, but in other places not far away this maybe difficult to trace.5.15 If regional bodies were established with a wide range of executive powers    &apos;the demarcation lines of regional boundaries would be of increasing practical importance to individuals because the nature and level of government services,and the spending priorities, might differ significantly between neighbouringregions.   An important issue for consideration, therefore, is how far - againsta historical tradition of common standards - new regional authorities in Englandcould be expected to command, especially in boundary areas, the public supportnecessary for the acceptance of potentially differing policies and standards,going far beyond the differences encountered in adjoining local authority areas todaj-5.16 Moreover, boundaries suitable for one function are not necessarily suitablefor another.   This may not be an insuperable problem but nobody can doubt thatthere are substantial difficulties involved.   A clear example is water supply,since the areas covered by the regional water authorities have to be drawn up onthe basis of undivided river basins: regions suitable for water supply would makelittle sense for most other purposes.    In the consultative document on the review(7)of the water industry     , the Government made it clear that they remained committed to the principle of unified river basin management, as the basis of the industry&apos;sregional structure; although they were well aware of the problems of reconciling tht-adequate democratic control of water au thorities with the large size of some of the river &quot;k-s:-, .......------------- &apos; &apos;-^ &apos;Review of the Water Industry in England and I/ales (Department of the Environment,Welsh Office and Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food - 1976).(confidential)
(confidential)5,17 Another example is health, where the boundaries of the rational health authorities must have regard to established pattern of delivery of health care,which are themselves largely determined by the location of major facilities suchas the ls.rge hospitals associated with universities and their medical schools.5.18 Yot another is transport, where the natural basis for control tends eitherto be national (motorways, trunk roads and railways), or local, as with busoperation, though the boundaries do not in some cases accord with those of anyone local authority.5.19 Again, regional areas suitable for strategic land use planning purposesmight prove too large for other services often proposed for a regional level, suchas police and the fire service.   If county   authorities were to disappear mostexisting districts outside the main conurbations would probably be too small interms of population either for education and personal social services, or asequivalents of (or replacements for) area health authorities (now based on non-metropolitan counties, metropolitan districts and London boroughs).5.20 It would be desirable to achieve a reasonable balance between regions interms of size and economic potential, but London and the South East present aspecial problem from this point of view.   The population of the area coveredby the South East Economic Planning Region is 17 million people - over   thatof England, three times that of Scotland and almost six times that of Wales.This problem could not be solved by breaking up the area into artificial sub-units.Any proposals for a regional structure would have to take account of the dominanceof the South East in relation to the rest of England, and of London over the restof the South East.(confidential)
Other vmrilications5.21     The present structures of local government, the National health service, the regional water authorities, end the police service, have beenin existence for less than three years.   These new structures are still inthe process of settling down.    The Government are fully aware of the widespreadcriticism of certain aspects but any further major redistribution of localgovernment functions would be hound to take a good many years to plan and carry out.   And to attempt radical change Effecting London and the rest of thecountry simultaneously would be unprecedented; previous reorganisationsaffecting London separately were major tasks in their own right.   The expectedlong term benefits of any change have to be measured against the disruptiveeffects in the meantime.   And if one set of changes follows another, the pointmay come at which the penalties of the recurrent process of change outweigh the advantages which it is hoped ultimately to achieve.5.22     There is also the effect on the individual   citizen.   A further reorganisation so soon after the last one would be &quot;bound to create confusion in the mind of the average elector.   It is also probable that he would feel more remote :from the affairs of a local government body administering services over a much wider area - as would certainly be the case with regional authorities.5.23     There is at present a direct relationship between local authorityboundaries and the boundaries of health regions and areas.   Unless the benefits of -fits relationship were to be set aside any major reorganisation of localgovernment would have to be accompanied by changes in the&apos; National health service.
l vVi^s EB-^B-fiNi a ink-J5&apos;24 A reorganisation of local government which involved the assumption of responsibilities for the health service would require a fundamental reorganisation of the National Health Service.   This is an Exchequer financed service v^ith twolevels of management accountable to the Secretary of State for Social Services.Virtually all the statutory functions are vested in him and he in turn makes themexerciseable by the 14 regional and 90 area health authorities.    The service isa national one in which the Secretary of State, with his Ministerial colleagues,sets national policies and objectives and has, in the last resort, power to issueformal directions to the regional and area authorities as to how they should exercise the functions delegated to them.   Control of the health, service by /elected authorities would require a complete redefinition of the central governmentsrole in relation to it and would inevitably diminish its national character.5*25 Radical reorganisation of this kind would raise major questions as to how the Service should be financed and what the lines of accountability should be-Major changes of organization would be expensive both in the administrative costs of planning and carrying them through and also in the effects whichorganisational upheaval would have on morale and in the conflicts and uncertaintythat would accompany it.5^6 The Government have appointed the Royal Commission on the National health service to consider the best use and management of the financial and manpowerresources of the Service.   The memorandum that the Commission has issued on itstask makes clear that it will be examining the structure of the Service and itsrelationship to central and local government.    It will need to take into account the development of thinking on devolution in England and its own conclusions willmake an important contribution to that thinking.   A final decision on the structure of the National Health Service must await receipt and consideration of theCommission^ Report.(confide confidential )
(confidential)Surjninrr Uo5.27 To sum up, the case for change is seen to lie in -a. lightening the burden on central government, enabling it to concentrate on matters of genuinely national importance;b. bringing government closer to the people;c. rendering the work of major nominated bodies subject to local democraticcontrol; and d. providing a layer of government to deal with such matters as may be       ^better dealt with at a level intermediate between central and local government as they now exist.5.28 But the case for any particular form of change hag to be examined within a framework of practical constraints and implications.   On this basis, the viabilityof possible new forms of government in England depends on the view taken of -a. the constitutional implications, including the effect on the powers ofMinisters to maintain national policies and on the role of Parliament;b. the financial implications, including the arrangements for fundingany new institutions;c. the problems of drawing new boundaries; and d. other implications, including the effects on existing institutions, bothduring the transitional period and in the longer term and the extent to whichthe problems that are seen can be tackled without radical change.(confidential)
(confidential)vi the CONSULTATIVE PROCESS6.1 As explained   in   Section   I,this consultative document does not put forward proposals for changes in the structure of government in England.The Government wish to hear and consider    views     and to carry out their ownfurther studies before deciding what, if any, changes to recommend.6.2 The main purpose of this consultative document has accordingly been to setout in general terras the broad issues which the Government consider should bebefore members of the public when they form their own conclusions on whetheror not there is a need for change and, if so, what forms such change might take. /6-3   There can clearly be a variety of replies to the central question whichthis paper poses: are there any specific ways in which the structure of governmentin England might be altered so as to make it more democratically accountable,responsive and efficient, reduce the burdens on Whitehall and Westminster, and develop its full potential for improving the quality of life?6.4   There are, on the one hand, those who feel that the predominant requirementat present is for a period of stability   and that efforts should be concentrated on making the present system work better.   On the other   hand    there are people who feel that what is needed is the establishment of directly-elected regional assemblies taking functions from central government, local governmentand nominated bodies.   Between these two positions lies a whole series of inter-mediate options which shade into each other.6-5   These are manifestly difficult matters and need thorough consideration anddebate.   Behind them lie two questions of great importance to the efficiency ofgovernment and to all citizens and taxpayers, namelyJ-a.   whether government would be more acceptable, accessible and accountableif there were a new regional layer of democratically elected governmentexercising functions at present exercised centrally or locally?E
(confidential)b.     whether, if ways could be found of bringing this about, governmentwould he more efficient?6.6   What the Government now want is to find out in which ways people inEngland would like to see our institutions develop.   To preserve its vitalitya Parliamentary democracy must he capable of adapting to changing needs andpressures, external and internal - hence the proposals for Scottish and Welshdevolution; and the need for thought and debate about English institutions.It is the purpose of this consultative paper to encourage that thought andstimulate that debate.6.7   Government Departments will be writing direct to bodies with whom theyare regularly in contact seeking their views on the matters raised in thisconsultation document.   Among the issues on which views are invited are:-i.     In what fields of government responsibility in England, if any, is itii.   Is there a case for an English Development Agency or for English1considered that the present level at which decisions are taken (Whitehall/nominated bodies/counties/districts) is wrong?regional development agencies (see Section III)?iii. What are the advantages and disadvantages (see Section IV) of -no changeb.some form of radical changesome form of limited change?
(confidential)iv. Do people in England have a sense of regional identity strong enoughto support regional units of government?v. What principles should determine the size of regional areas?   hew should (the boundaries be drawn?   How many regions should there be?   What should hedone about London and the South East?vi. If regional units were set up, should their functions be only advisoryand co-ordinating or. should they have executive powers?/vii. How should any such units be financed? ^viii.Would the development of regional institutions solve or reduce anynational problems?   If so, which?ix. Would substantial variations between regions in the standard of public services, and the choice of spending priorities, be acceptable?x. What are the deficiencies in the present structure, boundaries anddistribution of functions within local government?   How might they be remedied, broadly within the present structure?xi. What is the degree of urgency of any changes in English arrangementswhioh may be desired?6.8  Members of the public wishing to express their views on these issues orany other aspect of the matters discussed in this consultative document areinvited to write to the Constitution Unit, Cabinet Office, Great George Street,London SW1P 3AQ.
