DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S government cp(76) 126 COPY NO   g 130 November 1976CABINETPUBUC EXPENDITURE - CONTINGENCY measures memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. In my paper on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) negotiations(CP(76) 111) I said that, as agreed earlier on, work has been carried outby officials of the Treasury and Departments concerned on public expenditure reductions which might be technically possible; and that myofficials had also done some work on illustrative packages of differentmagnitudes.    I now enclose the paper by Treasury officials; Appendix Ato the paper summarises the illustrative packages.   Appendix B gives afull list of the technically possible reductions from which these packageshave been constructed, and is accompanied by Annexes on the individualitems listed.2,        This paper is not circulated as a basis for specific decisions a tour meeting on 1 December, but so that Cabinet can form a preliminaryimpression of the kind of measures which might be involved in packagesof the order of magnitude which I indicated in CF(76) 111,    For thispurpose, my colleagues need initially to look at no more than Appendix A.3.        I also referred in CP(76) 111 to my proposals to encourage a shiftto foreign currency Jinancing of export credit.    Further consideration will have to be given to the amount of expenditure savings which can be claimed as a result of action in this area.    The present fixed rate schemeis open-ended and as matters stand we are faced with a potentially largeaddition to the previous forecasts of this expenditure.    But if the proposals  have made are approved, or if we can find alternative ways of achievingsavings in the export credit field, this would help to counter the prospectivehigher demand for fixed rate credit, and make some contribution to the required savings for 1978-79.    Meanwhile, no allowance for thesepotential savings has been made in the illustrative packages.4,        I should also point out that, if it is proposed to allocate additional funds in the year ahead to schemes of support for employment or industry -other than the Selective Investment Scheme about which the Chief Secretary1
is in touch with the Secretary of State for Industry on the basis already agreed in Cabinet - allowance for these would have to be made from the outset.    The total expenditure reductions would thus have to be large enough to cover any such extra funds and still achieve the requiredobjectives.D W treasury Chambers30 November 19762
SECRETPublic Expenditure - Contingency PlanningNote by the treasury.     The Cabinet agreed on 26 October that officials should undertakean exercise to identify areas in which reductions in public expenditure in 1977-78 might technically be possible, on the basis that Ministers would be in no way committed by the exercise.   the appreciation of technically possible reductions set but below andin the enclosures to this paper has now been prepared in the light ofurgent discussions between the Treasury and the Departments concerned,but the text has not been agreed interdepartmentally and some of theestimates are still provisional.General Approach2.     Two broad approaches can be adopted in seeking expenditurereductions.   One is to impose across-the-board percentage cute on general categories of expenditure, as was done, for example, in the1975 Budget.   The other is to take a number of specific policy decisions which would.reduce expenditure on particular programmes.3.     The first approach is a way of distributing the burden of the cuts but does not itself identify the action required to achieve the savings.   This method may have to be considered if &quot;equality of misery&quot;is considered necessary;   hut it has no regard to relative priorities and cannot take account of the relative damage to objectives and thepractical difficulties involved in achieving the cuts.   Also thereare large areas of public expenditure, especially social security,where the across-the-board technique is particularly difficult toapply.   Even over the remainder of the field, while across-the-boardcuts have been used in the past, they can rarely be imposed withoutat least some exemptions, and without encountering unforeseen snagswhich erode the planned savings.   The recent exercise to identify thestaff savings for which credit was taken in Cmnd 6393 shows the risks of announcing cuts before it has been clearly established how theywould be achieved.   Given the extent to which expenditure has been1SECRET
squeezed already, there is a real risk that such cuts, if announcednow, would not be fully realised in practice, or carry convictionwith outside observers.4.     The moratorium technique represents in a sense an in-betweenapproach.   It involves a policy decision to postpone for a givenperiod all capital projects not already committed over a wide range of programmes.   This is in itself a method of securing the savings;the incidence on each programme depends not on any pre-determinedpercentage but on the capital projects in the programme and theextent to which they are committed.   The Annexes to this paper which deal with individual areas of expenditure include, in appropriate cases, an estimate of the effect of a moratorium on new capital projects and some other capital expenditure.5.     Apart from this, the exercise has concentrated on specificpossible measures affecting particular programmes.   The approach hasbeen to identify measures which would start to produce savings in1977-78 and between them have a substantial effect on expenditure inthat year, but not to exclude measures which, while contributing tosavings in 1977-78, would produce their full-year effect in 1978-79.All the options which have been identified are summarised in the tableat Appendix B to this paper, which is supported by more detailedannexes on the individual items.   Annex 16 discusses briefly thequestion of economy in expenditure on the civil service.General appraisal6,     It will be seen that if all of these possible measures were adopted (taking the higher options where there are alternatives) theycould between them produce gross expenditure savings of the order of 3 billion in 1977-78, at 1976 Survey prices.   This does not howevermake allowance for any additional expenditure on employment-creatingmeasures of a kind which have been suggested for possible inclusion in any package of savings (see Annex 17).   Any such measures would need to be decided at the same time, so that they could be broughtinto account in settling the total amount of savings that were required.1SECRET
7.     A package of this magnitude would involve substantial further action in the fields of housing, health and education, a significant contribution from the aid programme; additional defencecuts which could raise the question of a further defence review;and savings in general schemes of regional support to industrywithout re-allocating any of the savings to the National EnterpriseBoard and selective assistance to industry.     It would mean nouprating of social security benefits or public service pensions in1977-78; and a complete stoppage of all new public sector construction,including housing, for at least twelve months.     This last measure would account for about a third of a  3 billion package, as the        Ifollowing rough estimates show.  million (1976 Survey Prices)1977-78 1978-79Savings from moratorium of:-6 months 700 50013 months 1,200 1,250(These amounts are already included in the appropriate sections ofthe Table at Appendix B and are not additional to the figures shown in it.)    A note on the effect of these savings on theconstruction industry is at Annex 15-Illustrative packages8.     Any substantial additional savings in public expendituremust involve both further action on programmes which have alreadybeen reduced from their previously planned levels, and also on other programmes which have hitherto been much less affected.It is also difficult to frame such a package without employingboth policy changes and the moratorium method.     However, to enable ministers to consider possible decisions which wo.J.d involvesomewhat less drastic recourse to either, but with correspondingly3SECRET
less relief to the borrowing requirement, Treasury officials havebeen asked to present different illustrative packages of possible measures.   Those which are discussed below, and which are summarised in Appendix A, are not advanced as proposals by the Treasury ateither Ministerial or official level, but as illustrations of how,if Ministers decided on levels of savings falling short of the 3 billion discussed above, these levels could be secured.9.     In this presentation, options have been set out in three categories, ie. measures not involving legislation;   measuresinvolving subordinate legislation or a Finance Bill clause;   and measures involving main legislation - ie. in increasing order of difficulty from the legislative point of view.   Within eachcategory alternative amounts are listed as components of either a smaller or a larger package, ie. in increasing order of difficultyfrom the point of view of the amount involved.10.   The first category, not involving legislation, assumesroughly a six months moratorium (not applicable to housing) onprogrammes other than roads;   the road programme would not be affectedby a moratorium of limited duration, and is therefore assumed tomake an ad hoc contribution to the smaller package and a largercontribution, arising from a twelve months moratorium on roads only,to the larger package.   The housing programme is assumed to findoffsets to the increases which will otherwise arise in this programme in 1977-78, but to make a net contribution only to thelarger package.11.   While the first category is a mixture of measures directlyaffecting employment and others consisting of transfer payments,the second category - still not involving main legislation -consists almost wholly of subsidies and transfer charges.   But the option which consists of a new policy for limiting the subsidy to school meals could also indirectly lead to a reduction in thevery large.staff numbers engaged in the school meals service;4SECRET
it would thus be the one measure which could supplement the rate support grant settlement in influencing the numbers working for local authorities.12.   The only main legislation for consideration arises in the fields of social security and public service pensions.   Thus there are twosalient questions for consideration here - are the Governmentprepared to legislate at all in this field?   And if so, are theyprepared to repeal, modify or suspend the commitment, to mandatoryupratings in line with prices for certain benefits, or for others     /in line with prices or earnings (hitherto interpreted as gross earnings) whichever of these is the more favourable?15.   If the answer to both these questions were yes, a wide range of options would become open and, up to a point, the decision asbetween the options would depend on the size of the savings whichthe Government were prepared to secure in this field.   Theprovisional figures which have been shown assume, for the sake ofillustration, that in either package earnings-related supplementwould be discontinued and that, in addition, in the smallerpackage benefits would he uprated in line with net earnings, while in the larger package the uprating would fall short of net earnings.An important feature of a change in upratings is that it oould givebigger full-year savings in 1978-79 than in 1977-78, which could beof great help in dealing with the continuing problem of the borrowing requirement in the later year.    (The implications of the revised national income forecasts for the unemployment provision inthe social security programme are discussed in Annex 11).Northern Ireland14.   None of the figures cover Northern Ireland programmes.   When savings havebeen determined in Qreat Britain programmes, it would be necessary to consideradditional savings in the corresponding Northern Ireland programmes equivalent to2   of the amount saved in Great Britain.   Some programmes, such as defence, are on a UK basis and there is no separate Northern Ireland programme.5SECRET
The base-line for expenditure reductions15.   The UK&apos;s performance in controlling public expenditure is nowmonitored by reference to the last White Paper figures, updated totake account of price changes and announced policy changes, includingthe measures announced in July affecting 1977-79*     The positiondisclosed in July left a much reduced contingency reserve for that year,and since then there are increased estimates for the cost in 1977-78of a number of open-ended programmes.     These include an additionalrequirement for e.c. contributions of about  40 million; an increase of 75 million in the estimated cost of the temporary employment subsidyand job creation programme under the schemes already announced; and,in spite of the new terms negotiated for refinance of fixed ratecredit for exports and shipbuilding, an extra  55 million for that scheme.     Thus, in relation to the White Paper plan, these extrarequirements will have to be set against any savings now secured.Moreover, though the higher interest charges which affect the housing programme have already been the subject of decisions for 1978-79 and later years, the corresponding excess in 1977-78 has not been tackledpending the present round of discussions.     For that reason the need to find savings of about  220 million on this programme before any netsavings in it can be scored has been noted in Appendix A.16.   As regards 1978-79* Ministers have more recently taken decisionsdesigned to get back to the White Paper levels, but even here thereare problems arising from the open-ended programmes.    Apart from thespecial case of provision for the unemployed, which is explained in annex 11, these programmes include, once again, contributions to the eec and a further large potential requirement of about  160 million for fixed rate refinance.     Proposals are being put separately to cabinet for policy changes on export credit which would reduce theGovernment refinancing requirement, but the forecast excess would represent a first charge on any such savings.    A very provisional estimate of the net public expenditure saving on export credit ifthese proposals are implemented is  30 million in 1977-78 and 50 million in 1978-79t compared with the White Paper projections.SECRET6HM Treasury30 November 1976

u    -t annex 1DefenceAs a result of the 1974- Defence Review the Defence Budget wassharply reduced, in line with the decision to concentrate on our contribution to NATO and to end other commitments wherever possible.Further cuts were announced in Cmnd 6395 and in July 1976.   the ceiling for 1977/78 is now more than  300m below the Defence Reviewlevel.   These further savings have been presented as not directlyaffecting the front line, as they will he achieved by a severesqueeze in the support area and deferments of equipment and worksexpenditure.   The Americans and Germans in particular have doubts      /about the effect on the front line and have noted the cuts withconcern.   Finally Cabinet have now decided that defence should,contribute savings of  30m a year from 1978/79 to help offset theadditional housing bids.2.    Substantial further savings cannot he achieved by paring at the margin.   MOD say that not more than  50m could be saved in this way in 1977/78;   a cut of even this amount which would be impossible if we failed to get German offset would add to the political and militarydamage, flowing from the latest cuts.   They consider that there isno scope for paring in subsequent years.   The Treasury believe thatparing of rather more than  50m a year might be achieved in 1977/78and rather less in subsequent years.3*     Anything more than this would require major changes in defence policy.   An urgent study would be needed:(i) to relate our commitments to what we could afford;(ii) to identify feasible means of reducing our capabilities;   and(iii) to assess the implications of particular measures for thedefence of the West, for our political and militarystanding! and for industry and employment.4.     To limit the political and military damage consultation withNATO would be essential on the form of the cuts.   The study and consultation would have to be completed quickly to enable the cutsto take effect in 1977/78; and account would have to be taken of redundancy and cancellation charges.   Further major defence cuts would seriously damage our credibility with Allies and the morale ofour own forces.   Moreover our chances of obtaining offset payments from Germany in respect of the foreign exchange costs.of our forces/there
S E C E E there would be much, reduced,   At home there would be opposition to theprospect of reduced employment, both directly in the armed forces and indirectly in supplying industries.5.     It is difficult in advance of a study to be precise about what measures would have to be taken to secure a given saving and whatthe consequences might be.   Provided the study was undertaken quickly and pur Allies were persuaded both of the inevitability of furtherdefence cuts and the acceptability of the measures proposed some savingsshould in the treasury s view be possible in 1977/78, of the order of 100m below the baseline figure.   We should aim to secure savings ofsome  200* a year in 1978/79 and subsequent years.6.    Purely for illustration, to achieve savings of this size mightinvolvet-(i) A choice between maintaining the Navy with its presentfleet and role and keeping substantial forces in Germany,in line with Treaty obligations, to defend our sector of theCentral Front.   Withdrawal of forces from Germany could saveup to  500m a year in foreign exchange at current pricesalthough public expenditure would be substantially increased in the short-term to meet redeployment costs.   Evendisbandment of these forces would not save money in the shortterm, because of redundancy payments *(ii) A, quicker withdrawal from Cyprus and Gibraltar despite the political difficulties. Complete withdrawal would yieldsavings rising to  50m a year by 1979/80.(iii) Scrapping our nuclear deterrent or letting itseffectiveness deteriorate.   This could ultimately save 40m-140a a year.
OVERSEAS AID PROGRAMMECmnd 6J93 programme  million at 1976 Survey prices1976-775161977-7854A-1978-79579The size of the Aid Programme is not determined, as some other programmes are, by the need to maintain a given level of service,to meet statutory commitments.   The constraints upon reducing theprogramme are - political considerations apart - (i) the extent towhich it is already contractually committed (ii) foreign policyconsiderations.orCONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS2.     For 1977-78 we estimate that some  350 million is firmly andcontractually committed.   Another  100 million or so is, although notsigned sealed and delivered, pretty firmly morally committed:   in this category, for example, come projects and programmes which ODM have discussed with recipient governments or international organisations,avowedly with a view to signing agreements, but where the agreements are not yet signed.   This leaves about  .100 million which is notmorally or contractually committed for 1977-78 and about the samefigure for 1978-79-   Provision will need to be made out of these sumsfor such contingencies as an ODM contribution to a Rhodesian TrustFund and to a Common Fund, or to other new commitments which may arise from the North/South Dialogue.   But the Treasury think that areduction of  50-100 million in both years would be feasible (after taking account of the reduction of  5 million for 1978-79 agreed in cabinet on 11 November).FOREIGN POLICY CONSIDERATIONS3.     These cut both ways.   On the one hand cuts in the aid programmemight be well received by our creditors as a sign of realism and ofthe government&apos;s wholehearted commitment to the control of public expenditure.   Against this cuts would put at risk the policy ofincreasing the proportion of the aid programme which goes to the poorest (although this is already high by international standards);they would also mean no improvement and, depending on their size,perhaps a decline in our performance against the 0.7% target.   Vehave taken credit internationally for not cutting aid so far.   Lastly,it may be argued that cuts will make still more difficult the attainment]of our damage-limitation objective in the North/South dialogue,particularly in the Conference on International Economic Co-operation(CIEC), whose final Ministerial session will be in December.
defterFood SubsidiesThe removal of all provision for food subsidies in 1977/78(currently  200m at 1976 prices) would raisethe food index, overthe year as a whole, by about 1.396 and the all-items index by about .3%.   It would mean bringing forward the abolition of the bread and flour subsidies by 3-4 weeks and that of the butter and cheesesubsidies by 8 months (from November to March 1977 - which is roughly when butter and cheese prices will in any case go up as aresult of the next move towards e.c. prices). It would also takeaway the possibility of a reduction in the milk price for next summer; instead an increase might be needed, perhaps as early asMay.2.     Details of possible effects of total removal of subsidies andof less extreme courses are annexed.

ANNEX 4INDUSTRY AND REGIONAL SUPPORTThe Cabinet decided on 4 November that expenditure figures for theNational Enterprise Board and other selective assistance should beleft in the next White Paper at their present level pending the outcome of a further review of the scope for savings in other areasof industrial support.   Provision for a successor to the accelerated Capital Projects (ACP) scheme was to be treated as a potential charge to the Contingency Reserve.Abolition of REP taking effect from the next financial year would be possible by statutory order: withdrawal from development areas alone would require a clause in the Finance Bill.   The invest-ment effects are not thought likely to be significant.   Withdrawalof REP from Development Areas might involve the loss of 4,000 jobs in the first full year: withdrawal from Special Development Areascould involve the loss of a further 6,000 jobs in the same period.In broad terms, withdrawal of REP from Development Areas in thesecond half of next year would save some  20m in 1977-78: savings of some  l^Om would be secured by total abolition.   Savings in later years from total abolition would amount to  170m.   Such savings would correspondingly reduce the room for manoeuvre in the widerreview of industrial support.A 25% cut in regional development grants to Development areas would save  50m in a full year.   A similar cut applied to grants in special Development Areas would yield a further  40m.   But even ifapplied forthwith to new applications, savings in 1977-78 would beouch less.   Such a measure,without notice and in present conditions,would be damaging to confidence although the effects would be laggedand national investment levels would probably be little reduced inthe short term.
EMPLOYMENT(a) Reduce loan sanction for capital spending at colleges ofFurther Education for industrial training purposes.Little has been used this year and the allocation of 13.2 million could well be reduced by at least 10 million this year and half that for following years.(b) Postpone MSCs dispersal move to Sheffield by a year.       &apos;This will cost  2 million in 1977-78 and  20rtin total.SECRET

On the twelve-month moratorium, D/Tp consider that the feasiblesavings on trunk roads in 1977-78 would be only  15 million. That is the saving that would be achieved by letting no new contracts after15 November other than those that have already been put out to tender.To obtain the further  25 million it would be necessary to withdrawinvitations to tender that have already been leeued.3*   The scope for further savings on local authority road a is limited by the facts, first, that substantial savings on capital will berequired to offset the prospective excess on current expenditure and,aecondly, that about  20 million a year for new road a is linked toprojects for new housing and new Industry.SECRET

Legislation wouldbe required to prevent authorities continuing to lend out of repay-ments of existing loans; much of the lower end of the housing market would seize up completely; and co-operation with the building society-ties, who would fear that they would be pressed to make good thereduction in mortgage funds, would be jeopardised.1977-78     1978-79SUBSIDIES 60 90The figures assume average increases in rents of  1 a week in both1977-78 and 1978-79.

Subject to the qualifications in the following sentences,each additional 10p a week on average rents would yield  15 million(net of rebates) in the year in which it was imposed and in subse-quent years.   But if there were a serious economic crisis, earnings and employment would be depressed, so that the basic level ofexpenditure on rebates and supplementary benefits would be higher,and the net savings from rent increases would be lower.Because of the statutory rule against &quot;profits&quot; on local authority housing revenue accounts, legislation would be needed to allow the generality of authorities to raise rents by more than about 80p aweek.   The Government has no power to require local authorities toraise rents.   Very large increases (say, much above  1 a week)might well require legislation conferring such power.

/eating packedEDUCATIONSCHOOL MEAL service this year net expenditure on the school meal service (after deductingreceipts from the charge) ie expected to he about  U00 million(Great Britain).   Of that sum, about  115 million Is the cost ofproviding free school meals for pupils and staff who qualify for them.The other  285 million is the subsidy for those who pay for theirmeals ae the present charge of 15p covers only about one-third of     ^the average cost.   Existing policy (stated in Cmnd 6393) is to raisethe charge progressively, beginning with an increase of lOp inSeptember 1977, so that by 1980 the subsidy is halved and net expenditure on the school meal service is reduced to about  250 million.2.     In estimating whether further savings could be made, it is assumed that in 1977-73 it would be possible to increase the schoolmeal charge by 5p in April 1977 and 5p in September 1977 instead of having a single increase of lOp in September,   But it la also assumed that in later years it would not be possible to increase the chargeby more than about lOp a year (as assumed in Cnmd 6393).   To makesavings on existing figures it would therefore be necessary to reducethe unit cost of a meal or the entitlement of staff to free meals, asindicated below.    (Some of the savings that could be made in this wayhave already been used to offset part of the additional expenditureon housing.)3.     If the present hot meal service were replaced by a pre-packedcold meal with milk, it should be possible to reduce the unit costby about one-fifth.   The food coBts would be a little higher than atpresent but the staff costs would he much lower.   On the aasumptionthat local authorities accepted the new service   and began toIntroduce it in 1977-78, savings might be up to  35 million in thatyear and to  75 million in a full year.4.     It should also be possible to cut down the number of free mealsProvided for staff.   Part of the saving would be obtained as a resultof reducing the number of kitchen staff.   Moreover, if pupils were
SBCSETeating packed, cold meals, it might he possible to reduce the amount of supervision by teaching staff; then, after negotiation with the teachers&apos; unions, the entitlement of free meals might be limited to staff who were genuinely supervising the service.   Depending on the outcome, the savings might be  5 million- 15 million in 1977-78 and 15 million- 30 million in a full year.5.

HEALTH AND PKRdONAL SOCIAL SERVICES (HPSS)The table below lists available options for reducing expenditure onthe HPSS programme. The savings shown assume that, except whereindicated, any necessary legislation could be enacted and otherpreparatory measures taken in time for savings to take effect from thebeginning of the financial year 1977-78. The savings fall into twobroad categories - increases in yield from charges and reductions inforecast expenditure on the health services. No savings on localauthority personal social services current expenditure are identifiedsince it is assumed that, even with the help of virement from the /capital programme, the local authorities will as it is be hard pressed to contain this expenditure within the Cmnd 6393 figures.2.    Although all the options listed are technically and administratively-ively feasible, a realistic total saving on charges might be in the region of  40 to  45 million in 1977-78. This might comprise increases inprescription charges and bringing forward by a year the additionalincreases in dental service charges.   Charging for hospital meals is afeasible option but is operationally more complex and should perhaps be regarded as a desirable measure for the longer term. Together with current and capital savings of  60 to  70 million, a realistic totalsaving in 197?-?8 on the HPSS programme would be in the region of  100to  115 million.3.     In 1978-79 on-going savings from increasing the yield from charges would be slightly less in view of the decisions now taken for that year.!t would, however, be possible to make a larger capital saving in1978-79 - some  50 million on health - if the moratorium on new startsWere extended for a further year.   On current costs, if expenditurecontinued to be held to the 1976-77 level, the savings in 1978-79compared with present Survey figures would be some  65 to  70 million.SHSS believe this would involve an actual cutback in the level of services provided for an increasingly elderly population as well ascurtailing the spread of new medical techniques.

SOCIAL security the table below lists available options for reducing expenditureon the social security programme.   All would require main legislationexcept where stated, and it is assumed that the necessary legislation would be enacted in time for savings to take effect from April 197?.Savings are shown for 1977-78 and for 1978-79 where appropriate.   Theestimates represent very broad orders of magnitude, using Surveyassumptions for unemployment and the future movement of prices and earnings.   The feasibility of some of the savings- might alsodepend on the willingness of the staff to carry out the necessaryoperations and there is no certainty about this.2.     Apart from the option on child benefit, the savings fall into two broad categories - changes in the statutory method of upratingbenefits, and abolition or restriction of existing benefits.   On the uprating it is assumed that the present legislation would be amended so as to substitute a discretionary power to uprate at such time by such method or amounts as the Secretary of State determines are appropriate.   Whatever the actual method of uprating chosen, therewould be no point in replacing it with another specific provision.3.

4.     It should be noted that in practice the above savings would apply to a different social security programme base line from that so far displayed in the Survey.   This is because the figures arenow being revised to take account of the higher unemploymentprojections in the October National Income Forecast.   In completing the programme for the purposes of the Public Expenditure White Paperwe propose to make some upward adjustment in the appropriate benefitlines and to make additional provision by way of a margin of toleranceto be combined with the existing real improvement line at the bottom of the social security programme table.   The precise details willbe brought forward in the White Paper context later, and the changes should not significantly affect the broad estimates of possible savingsitemised above.
Occupational pensionsOn the assumption that legislation is taken to put the upratingof all Social Security benefits on to a discretionary basis, equitywould demand that corresponding action should be taken in respect of occupational pensions.   This would mean action on the following lines:-(i) Public Services (the Civil Service, Local Authority staffs,National Health Service, teachers, police and fire servicesand other smaller groups including the Judiciary and MPs).For these pensioners the Pensions (Increase) Act 1971 wouldhave to be amended to suspend the statutory right to priceindexation in favour of discretionary increases,, for so longas has been specified in the general social security field.Armed Forces pensions receive analogous treatment and couldbe covered by Prerogative Instrument.(ii) Rest of the Public Sector.     This is mainly the nationalised industries field which breaks down into 3 maingroups:-(a) Those whose scheme is linked to the 1971 Act andwould thus follow any amendment of that Act, e.g. PostOffice and Atomic Energy Authority pensioners.(b) Those who might be covered by Ministerial directive,e.g, miners and gas and electricity pensioners.(c) Those who would need to be covered by wider-ranginglegislation to suspend the contractual obligations oftheir pension funds, e.g. steel and airways pensioners and, failing ability to control by Ministerial directive,any under (b).(iii) Private Sector.     Wider-ranging legislation would equallybe needed to interfere with the contractual obligations ofprivate pension funds.   Even if the difficulties of such legislation were considered to be overriding, it would in any
event be essential in the interests of equity to restrictincentives by way of tax reliefsfwhere these result ininitial pension awards which would then conflict with levelswhich the Government believed appropriate (in particular thearrangement whereby an out-of-date salary may be uplifted for pension purposes by the increase in the cost of living up tothe date of retirement).   Any discrimination against thepublic sector would be strongly opposed by the public sectorunions.2.     The regular date for uprating public service pensions is1 December each year.   The Order determining the increase in December1976 has already been made.   The estimated cost was as follows:-Estimated costScheme ( million)Civil service 31Local government 22National health service 13Police and fire 10Teachers 12Armed forces 22Total 1103.     Any savings in the financial year 1977-78 could only be made from December 1977.   Using the same assumptions about future movements in earnings and prices as for the social- security options in Annex ll*a postponement of the December 1977 uprating until beyond the end of1977-78 would reduce the estimated level of public service pension^   L ,,,,      , and  166 million in 1978-79.payments by  43 million in that year   A limitation of the 1977 and1978 upratings to net earnings would reduce the payments by 13 million in 1977-78 and  91 million in 1978-79.4.     Although detailed estimates can only be provided for the majorpublic services, the savings in the rest of the public sector mightbe up to half as much again.   (In very round terms, it can beestimated that each 1% deducted from the RPI statutory increase next
year would save about  11 million; for the rest of the public sector the absolute maximum would be  6 million, but it is unlikelyin practice to be as much as that.)5.     These are all cash figures.   Public service pensions arehandled in the Survey in broadly the same way as pay, so that achange in the uprating would not automatically score as a public expenditure saving at constant 1976 Survey prices, but it should bepossible to take credit for the saving as part of a larger package.Depending on the precise arrangements made in the various pension schemes, there should be a saving on the public sector borrowing requirement of an order approaching that indicated in paragraph above,
SICRBTCOMMON SERVICES AND SOME OTHER CIVIL WORKS PROGRAMMESMoratorium on PSA Capital Expenditure (for oivil departments)  Billion1977-78      1978-796 months 10 1512 months 30 1*5The estimates are of a moratorium on all building work under-taken by the Property Services Agency (PSA) - ie not OnlyGanaral Office Accommodation for Civil Servants (Common Services)but also Diplomatic accommodation, and work In Prisons, Courts,etc   - except for Defence works which are considered as part ofthe Defence Budget in Annex 1.A moratorium would delay the Census 1981, the provision of a building for the Velah Assembly and the timetable for dispersal of Civil Servants, to all of which the Government are at presentcommitted.The estimated savings would be substantially redueed if exemptions&quot;ere Bade on economic grounds, eg for proceeding with neeessarywork on properties acquired but standing empty, and on grounds of operational priority.
Nationalised Industry PricesIt would be possible to oaks a reduction in public expenditure, under thenew presentation, by causing the nationalised industries to reduce theirnet borrowing requirement from the NLF, which they could do if they wereto increase their prices beyond what they are now planning.2.    The industries which present the greatest scope for such increases,because of the Market conditions they face, are electricity, gas and tele-communications.   Increases in their prices would have the following effectsin a full year.Each 1ft on He venue RPIpresent prices of  ejn&quot;T&quot;^ &quot;5T&quot;Electricity.........45..........   0.04Gas......................       13      ..........   0.004-Telecommunications.......      30      ..........   0.0123.    On present plans the electricity industry nay not want to take full advantage of the Price Code for &quot;their April 1977 price increase (because theyare worried about the impact which a maximum increase would have on demand)and neither gas nor telecommunications can make any further increases withoutbreaching the Code.   If the fuel industries generally increase their prices instep*they might lose some sales to oil, unless the tax on oil went up at thesame time.   There would also be pressure to increase the electricity discountscheme, and this could mean offsetting public expenditure increases.4.    The scope for price Increases, beyond those already planned, in otherindustries is limited.   Both Coal (1% yields  20m) and Posts (-Jp yields tMjm)could make increases but with some risk to their markets. &quot; Ball could well losebusiness to the extent that it is doubtful whether further price increases would reduce their net borrowing requirement at all.   Steel and Airways are con-strained by the International markets In which they operate.3.    The msnagements of the nationalised industries could be expected to reactstrongly against further intervention in their businesses, in the interestsof reducing public expenditure, coming on top of the cuts In their investment programmes for 1977/78 imposed in July.  Moreover, there is no direct methodby which Ministers could force industries to increase their prices beyond whatthey judged to be commercially necessary; pressure would have to be appliedIndirectly by reducing NLF finance.   Finally, forced price increases would makethe handling of NED0&apos;s report on the industries much more difficult, and wouldbe at odds with the Prime Minister&apos;s wish to toughen up prices policy.
ANNEX 15IMPLICATIONS FOB THE CONSTRUCTION   INDUSTRYProposals for moratoria in public sector construction starts should be seen in the context that the construction industry is expected to generate lessoutput in 1977 and 1978 than the depressed level of the current year, falling to an activity rate last met in 1965.   About 250,000 jobs have nowdisappeared since 1975* and some 100,000 more are likely to go by the end of1978.   The July 1976 cuts will be responsible for some 50,000 of these.2.     The reduction in construction employment (not cumulative) would veryroughly come to:1977-8 1978-96 month moratorium 90,000 80,00012 month moratorium 1^0,000 165,000These figures include indirect effects, for example on materials suppliers,assuming that for most programmes a  100 million cut means 13,000 fewer jobs in all,3.     Other types of cut would also have their impact on the construction industry.For example,  100 million of housing improvements in a given year would remove18,000 jobs.   Demand far private housing in any case is highly sensitive to building Society inflows.   In 1977 these could well fall more than currentlyforecast if the rate paid on their deposits (and as a consequence mortgage rates)cannot be raised sufficiently to ensure a marked improvement in Building Societycompetitiveness.   If these rates remain unchanged.and as a consequence the currentlow rate of inflow into the Societies were to continue during 1977, then private housing activity could be substantially lower than currently being forecast.k.    Morale in the construction industry was badly shaken by the July cuts.   InOctober the 2 construcj gjJ0^u)[?sl,jPu&apos;t * PaP91&quot; to raa)C on taa future role of theindustry which Mr Cuckney/as a plan for survival.   It drew attention to the risk that if capacity were run down any further a later upturn in demand for essentialindustrial building might be hard to meet.   The danger from the government&apos;s
1point of view is that this would lead to unacceptable delays in industrial investment (and already UK performance is worse than that of our competitors)or rapid price escalation such as we saw in 1972-3.   The industry would like tosee any new cuts at least balanced by counter measures such as an IPG holiday,the abandonment of legislation to extend local authority direct labour activities and better fiscal incentives for industrial buildings.   They also point to therisk that the Government might again have to bail out construction companies in financial difficulty to secure the completion of existing public sector projects.
ECONOMY IN CIVIL SERVICE expenditure the general positionIn the February Public Expenditure Whits Paper, Ministers announced their intention to find savings in Civil Service manpower costs of  140 million in1978-79 ( 174 million at 1976 Survey prices).   So far, they have agreed savings fromthe civil departments amounting to  118 million in l978-79t at 1976 Survey prices.They were unable to agree measures to save the remaining  56 million.   In the Surveyfigures as they now stand credit has not been taken for the remaining  56 million,but savings have been found in other areas, and the National Staff Side have beengiven the impression that the line has been drawn under this exercise.   Nor hascredit been taken for a contribution by the FCO pending the CPRS study.2.   The Civil Service manpower figures underlying the present Survey expenditureprojections are 772,000 at 1 April 1977 and 746,000 at 1 April 1978.   However, the size of the civil service on 1 October 1976 was in fact just over 746,000 (it may nowbe slightly higher).   This ia some 15,000 lower than provided for, and is the outcome of an intense squeeze on manpower during 1976.3.   If substantial savings were made from among the options described in the otherannexes to this paper, this would probably produce marginal reductions in CivilService manpower.   In view of this, and of the current position, it should be possibleto hold the strength of the civil service below 750,000 during 1977-78, end to reduceit below 740,000 during 1978-79-^.   This would result in an outturn (at 1976 Survey prices) for.1976-77 some  50million below the provision in the Survey, and a saving of  30 million in 1977-78;5.   On the assumption that the Survey figures should now be reduced to reflect the shadow target for the FC0&apos;s contribution to the savings in paragraph 1 above, thereshould be a further saving of about  1 million in 1977-78 and  8  million in 1978-79,Object to the reservation about timing mentioned in CP(?6)9.6-   To achieve this outcome will not be easy.    It leaves no provision for unforeseenchanges in economic assumptions, or for new Ministerial initiatives.   The reducedfinancial provision should be sufficient to cover present policies, but the achievement0? savings of this order will depend on Ministers keeping and holding the staff levels
1secretin their departments at an absolute minimum.A ban on recruitment7.   The suggestion has been made that further savings might be found by a ban on recruitment.   The latest annual wastage rate for non-industrial civil servants is 46,000, and a 12-month ban on recruitmentwould thus at most leave empty about 46,000 poets with a maximumpotential saving of about  75 million in the first year.      Inpractice it is difficult to estimate the saving, but it would bemuch less than this because departments would require the remainingstaff to work extra overtime and (most important) would retain staffotherwise due to retire.8.   Such a ban is open to the following objections:-a. It would be a wholly arbitrary cut, hitting hardest thedepartments with the highest wastage rates and those which mustexpand next year to cover essential new work.   All departments wouldbe damaged.   For example the combined effect of absorbing wastageand cancelling expansion would leave the Inland Revenue short ofabout 16,000 and DHSS of about 12,500 staff, quite apart from the seriousinconvenience of not being able to recruit casual staff to meet peaksof work.   The incidence of the ban on local offices wOuld varyunpredictably from small to crippling (clerical labour is not mobile).b. It could only be absorbed by dropping work, and the  140millionexercise has demonstrated the extreme difficulty of going further inthat direction.   If it were not accompanied by dropping work it wouldbe flatly counter to the Government&apos;s undertaking that the CivilService will be staffed to do the work required of it, and would arouse furious opposition from the unions.c. Because older staff at the top of their incremental scales wouldbe retained beyond retiring age, we should be employing the old,the sick and the expensive in substitution for those who are youngerfitter and cheaper.2
secretd.   It would worsen employment prospects for school-leaverswhile improving them for the over-60s - the exact reverse of present social policy.9.   Industrial Civil Service wastage is about 15$ a year.   Tohalt recruitment here might   well be to stop production at some government factories with a loss of export orders.10. For these reasons, a ban on recruitment is not a viable methodof achieving savings.   Departments will, however, automaticallyadjust their recruitment to achieve any reduction in their expenditure provision, eg on the lines of paragraph 4- above.
EMPLOYMENT MEASURESThis note examines the scope for possible action if Ministersfelt that, as part of a package to reduce public expenditure overall,some increase in the selective employment and training measures should be added back so as to mitigate the level of unemploymentnext year.2.     At present, these measures are assumed to come to an end overthe next 6 months, achieving a peak reduction in unemploymentestimated at 200.000 in March 1977 but tailing off to 35,000 by theend of the year.   The cost in 1977-78 on this basis is put at 240 million.3.     Until now, extensions have been decided and announced ad hoc,and charged against the contingency reserve.   But as a substantial part of the contingency reserve for 1977-78 is already committed,there is likely to be little or no room for charging such extensions to the contingency reserve in that year.   Hence the need to decidenow how much room should be made for any such expenditure, so thatthe reductions on other programmes can be set at a level which will produce the required net saving.4.     Some of the measures (job release, work experience) are only just coming into effect, and are experimental.   Hence a detailedprogramme of measures cannot be determined now over the whole year.In the &quot;ordinary way, DE and MSC would prefer to extend for 3 months the measures expiring at end-December - temporary employment subsidy(TES) and job creation (c.p.) - and reach firm decisions on the 1977programme in about March.   But the following broad options show theorders of magnitude involved.5.     Options(i) To continue special training measures onlyThis would cost  40 million gross and would reduce unemploymentby about 15,000 over the latter part of 1977.(li) As above plus c.p. to end-1977Cost  120 million gross, reducing unemployment by about 35,000
over the last half of 1977.    (c.p. could if necessary becontinued on a reduced level, giving intermediate figuresbetween (i) and (ii),)(iii) To extend or replace measures to retain peak (March) impactthrough rest of 1977Cost about  250 million gross, reducing unemployment at end-1977 by about 165,000.   Not all the present measures would need to continue, but TES would almost certainly continue atleast in a reduced form (full continuation would cost some 200 million gross), and the option is costed on this basis(with TES giving a favourable cost per job).(iv) To continue all the present measures through 1977Cost about  380 million gross, reducing unemployment at end-1977 by about 190,000 - higher than impact of existing set of measures, because some are now tailing off before others take full effect.6. Any further extension would require new measures, or increased expenditure on existing measures beyond present levels; it would belikely to yield diminishing returns in reduced unemployment.7.     It must be emphasised- that these are illustrative options, andthat intermediate positions are possible.   The estimates are alsorough, depending partly on what specific measures were adopted.   some part of the expenditure would fall in the following financial year,but the proportion is likely to be small.48.     The expenditure estimates are the gross costs.   The net cost tothe PSBR, after allowing for offsets, would be considerably less: forthe four options quoted above it C/ould be about  15 million, 50 million,  60 million and  90 million respectively.   The scale ofthe offsets is however uncertain (being dependent on an uncertainassumed effect on unemployment), and the gross cost measures theimmediate effect on public expenditure before allowing for suchoffsets.
9.     Moreover, while most of these measures yield more employment for a given sum than other public expenditure, the savingsillustrated elsewhere in this paper would themselves lead to anoffsetting increase in unemployment of a size depending on thenature of the saving.   The beneficial effect of the savings on thePSBR would thus likewise be less than the gross amounts shown in the annexes.   In the public expenditure context, both additions andsavings have to be scored gross.
