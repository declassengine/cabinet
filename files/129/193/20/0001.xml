DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(76) 130 copy NO   817 December 1976CABINETSCOTLAND AND WALES BILL - POST ^ASSENT REFERENDAMemorandum by the Lord Pre sident of the CouncilINTRODUCTION1. Second Reading of the Scotland and Wales Bill will take place on13-16 December inclusive.    The Ministerial Committee on DevolutionStrategy has already given some consideration to the Bill&apos;s Parliamentaryhandling at their meeting on 16 November (DVY(76) 5th Meeting); theyrejected the possibility of referenda before Parliament considered theBill but deferred a decision about the desirability of referenda after theBill had completed its passage until a more up to date assessment ofParliamentary opinion had been made,2.        There is now a fairly widespread expectation among the Press andgeneral public that there should and will be some form of referenda onthe devolution question and Ministers have already promised that ifproposals are made during the BiLUe passage for referenda at a later stage, the Government will consider them.   An Early Day motion calling for referenda before the Bill is introduced has been signed by 76 Governmentbackbenchers.3.        I believe that we should offer referenda in Scotland and Wales,post-Assent to the Bill; and that we should announce this on Second Reading.Reasoned amendments have already appeared on the Order Paper with more than 30 signatures, declining to give a Second Reading to the Bill&quot;unless a referendum is held before the Bill comes into effect to ascertain the wishes of the people of Scotland and Wales&quot;.    It is clear therefore thatthe issue is going to be raised again and again during Second Reading, andfor a substantial number of MPc may become the criterion by which theydecide whether or not to vote for the Bill.    For a constitutional Bill ofthis nature it is important to have a substantial majority at Second Reading, *$and I believe the offer of referenda will significantly increase thatmajority.1
4.        I alao believe that the decision to offer referenda will be widelywelcomed in Scotland and Wales, and that the referenda themselves will show that mere is substantial support for our devolution package,TIMING OF ANY CONCESSION5.        If the promise of referenda is to be used as a bargaining counter,it should be deployed at the stage in the Bill&apos;s passage where it is likelyto be of most value.6.        To announce post ^Assent referenda during the Second reading debate would have the advantage that the Government would be making a generous, not a grudging, concession;  an announcement in the opening speech would have a certain dramatic quality, or in the winding-up speechit could be seen to be taking account of the views expressed during the debate.7.        On balance, I believe we might get the most benefit by indicating,at Hie opening of Second Reading, that we saw a great deal of weight in thecase for referenda;  and then, subject to views expressed in the debate,by announcing firmly during the winding up that we would table proposalsfor post-Assent referenda, in Scotland and Wales only, on the proposals as &quot;they emerge in the Bill.    (We need not, at that stage, commit ourselves on whether there might be a further question on separation or on any otherdetails about how the referenda might be conducted).8.        Restricting the referenda to Scotland and Wales will be of crucial importance.    The inclusion of England might well lead to a hostile overallvote, dominated by the large English majority,    Jh proposing referenda wemust therefore be satisfied that we shall be able to put through the proposal in a form that limits tho voting to Scotland and Wales.   Amendments thatcommitted us to United Kingdom-wide referenda would, in my view, be worse than no referenda at all.conclusion. I invite my colleagues to agree:a. that referenda on devolution are now inevitable;b. that it would be helpful if it were made clear at the beginningof the Second Reading debate that the Government were sympathetic to the idea of post-Assent referenda;2
c.        that an announcement should then be made at the end of theSecond Reading debate that the Government would table proposalsfor referenda in Scotland and Wales, to be held after Royal Assent,on the proposals approved by Parliament.M FPrivy Council office December 19763
