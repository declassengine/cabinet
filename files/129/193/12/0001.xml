The Treasury were authorised last week to explore with the teamfrom the International Monetary Fund (IMF) the financial and economiceffects of three illustrative packages of economic measures.    It was made very clear that the discussions were strictly without commitment.2. The discussions focussed on a two-year prospect, up to the end ofthe financial year 1978-79.    The uncertainties beyond that are such that neither the Fund nor we would wish to commit ourselves to any kind of quantitative targets for the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR)or Domestic Credit Expansion (DCE) for 1979-80 or any later period.That did not in any way override our wish - with which the Fund would notquarrel - to present the measures we are now contemplating in the context of a three-year stabilisation programme.3, The context of these discussions was provided by economic&quot;simulations&quot;, using the Treasury&apos;s forecasting model.    But before Isummarise the outcome of these simulations - some more detailed figures are given in the Annex - I should emphasise five points which do notjuBt reflect official caution, but are genuinely important for our policy decisions.4, First, all the simulations assume that confidence is successfullyrestored and the internal and external deficits are successfully financed.That is a necessary assumption for forecasting purposes; the simulationsare designed to illustrate the problems likely to arise for decision by ministers - not to prejudge the policy decisions.    However, to the extent that those assumptions are unreal, the estimates suffer from an internalcontradiction, and would in practice be falsified.    The smaller the package,the greater this risk must be.1
5,        Second, it follows that the four simulations are not strictlycomparablen    For example, the financing prospects in the national income Forecast (NIF) and &quot;package one&quot; are such that, if other policiesremained unchanged, the markets would in practice compel a sharpadjustment in interest rates - above the present level which is(conventiooelly) assumed for the purpose of the simulations,    inconsequence, growth would be less, and unemployment, prices and thePSBR would all be higher than the simulations indicate.    By contrast,it is thought that packages &quot;two&quot; and &quot;three&quot; would make it possible toreduce interest rates below their present levels;  and the simulationbsuggest that the beneficial effects of this would go a long way to offset the ex ante deflationary effects of the packages themselves,6*        Third, the simulations have been worked out on the basis ofassumptions about the detailed composition of the packages which, at thisstage, can only be arbitrary.   A different mix of measures could produce a significantly different effect both on the real economy and on the monetary aggregates.7.        More generally, for illustrative purposes, and for the sake ofsimplicity, the three packages have been calculated very largely in termsof reduction in public expenditure.   A similar reduction in the PSBRcould, of course, be achieved by increases in taxation; and it is clear fromthe discussions which the Treasury have had with the IMF team, that they accept the possibility that tax increases could form some part of the totalpackage,8.        Fourth, the simulations take no account of any effects the packagesmight have on the rate of increase of earnings, or on the movement of theexchange rate.9*        Finally, the estimates, while they are the best that can be provided in the time available, are still subject to a very wide margin of error;and the margins of error are especially great when they look forwardtwo yearB to 1978-79.   Above all, projections of the monetary aggregatesdepend on assumptions on interest rates, capital flows, sales of gilt-edged,bank lending, and so forth which,   for a period of two years ahead, canonly be speculative.10.       All the estimates take credit for receipts from the sale at home ofa      billion parcel of British Petroleum (BP) shares in addition to public expenditure cuts,PACKAGE. ONE11,        This assumes public expenditure cuts of;-1977-78     billion1978-79   2 billion2
(In both years  5 billion of these cuts are assumed to have little or no effect on demand or activity).As one would expect, this suggests very much the same economic prospectas the basic NIF (which takes the same conventional financing assumptionsreferred to in paragraph 4. )a. The economy grows rattier slowly next financial year, butpicks up to an annual rate of between 3^ per cent and 3j per centin 1978-79.b. Unemployment increases to a level in the region ofif million,c. The current balance of payments remains in substantialdeficit during 1977, but moves into substantial surplus in the courseof 1978.d. The PSBR is about  9  billion in 1977-78, but increasesagain in 1978-79; and this is paralleled by the movement in DCE,12.        The IMF team showed no interest in this package.    They were quickto make the point that the monetary and financing problems implicit in thesimulation of this package would frustrate the &quot;simulated&quot; improvement inthe current balance, and thence the prospect of economic recovery.    Theyclearly believe that a package of this kind would represent a failure ofpolicy to respond to the prospect before us.PACKAGE TWO13.       This assumed public expenditure cuts of:-1977-78  0.8 billion1978-79  1,4 billion(In this simulation and package three a mixture of measures havebeen assumed, none of them being particularly &quot;demand light&quot;),14.       The simulations suggest that under this package:-a. The economy would grow a little more slowly during1977-78, but again pick up to an annual rate of between 3  per cent and 3f per cent in 1978-79,b. Unemployment is little changed by the end of 1977 butincreases to a level about 100, 000 higher by the end of 1978 thanthe national level under package one.3
c. The current balance is in slightly smaller deficit in 1977and slightly larger surplus in 1978.d. The PSBR is reduced to  9 billion in 1977-78 but risesa little again in 1978-79.    DCE is brought steadily down.15.       It was not possible last week to interest the IMF team in thispackage.    One point which they made was that there was a strong risk thata package of this ordar might not be sufficient to restore confidence in the markets, and we could therefore face further pressure in a few months1time to go through ohct again all the agony of a yet further policy review.PACKAGE THREE16.       This package aseumes:-Public expenditure cuts: 1977-78  1.2 billion1978-79  1,7 billionTax increases worth about S.\ billion in 1978-79 (as comparedwith the NIF assumptions).16.       The simulations suggest that on this package:-a. The economy would grow a little more slowly than underpackage two, both in 1977-78 and in 1976-79.b. Unemployment would develop in much the same way as inpackage two,c. The current balance would be marginally better than under&quot;Two&quot;.d. The PSBR would be reduced to  8j billion in 1977-78 andwould fall further in 1978-79. This would be reflected in a firmdownward trend in DCE.17.       This is the largest package which the Treasury explored with theIMF team.    The IMF regarded it as a basis for negotiation.    However, itstill fell considerably short of what they thought was required.   Focussing(as I have said) on the two-year prospect to 1978-79, they believed that weshould be aiming for a PSBR in that year of around   6^ billion.    Theyargued that a &quot;step change&quot; in policy, of the kind implied by such a PSBR,would create a wholly new climate in the country, leading to higherinvestment, higher exports and a better all-round economic performance.However, it was clear that this figure of  6^ billion (and almost certainly the figure of  7 billion which was also mentioned in discussions)turned on a rate of economic growth which we think improbably4
high and therefore dirt not represent their last word.    There would be reasonable prospects of securing their agreement to a somewhat higherPSBR than  7 billion; or alternatively the figure would be revised upwardsif we did not achieve this higher rate of growth.Z8e I have set out in a separate note (CP(76) 223) the conclusions whichI draw from the discussions, and the measures which I propose we should now take.d w treasury Chambers30 November 19765
