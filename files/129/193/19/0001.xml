DEVELOPMENTS IN THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIESMAY - NOVEMBER 1976Section L introduction. This is a report in the series presented to Parliament by the Governmenton Developments in the European Communities, It covers the period from1 May 1976 to 30 November 1976. The aim is to describe major decisions reached during this period and to refer to major work in progress. It dealswith developments in the three European Communities-the European economic community, the European Coal and Steel Community and the European atomic energy Community. Major developments in the process of political co-operation between the Governments of the Nine are described and an account is given of Community business in Parliament. The next report will cover theUnited Kingdom Presidency of the Council of Ministers which runs from january to June 1977.Section IL  Political Co-operation2. Consultation continues on a wide range of foreign policy issues amongthe Nine Member States of the European Communities, At the 30th general assembly, the Nine voted together on over 80 per cent of all occasions. the nine continue to support the United Nations Secretary General in his efforts to promote a peaceful solution in Cyprus.3. One of the recent areas of active co-operation among the Nine has beenSouthern Africa. On 18 September (designated as &quot;Namibia Day&quot; by (heUnited Nations) the Nine in a message to the United Nations Secretary Generalreaffirmed their suppprt for the right of the people of Namibia to self-determination-ation and independence. They have also made clear their decision not torecognise the Transkei. On 18 October the Foreign Ministers of the Nineissued a statement on Rhodesia welcoming Her Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;!convening of a conference to discuss the formation of an interim governmentin Rhodesia and urging the parties concerned to take advantage of this opportunityto bring about an orderly and peaceful transfer of power to the majority.4. A highly developed area of political co-operation is the Euro/ArabDialogue. The Nine attach importance to this means of deepening and strengthening their relations with the Arab world. The first meeting of theGeneral Committee held in Luxembourg from 18 to 20 May emphasised thepolitical as well as the economic significance of the Dialogue. Discussionsamong experts are continuing in a number of economic, technical and culturalfields.5. The first conference of Community Ministers of the Interior and ministers with similar responsibilities took place in Luxembourg at the end of June todiscuss matters of common interest, in particular with regard to law and order.Ministers expressed their common resolution to strengthen their co-operation in the fight against organised international crime, particularly terrorism, and agreed upon a programme of specific areas in which existing co-operationbetween the competent authorities in the Member States could usefully be
extended. This programme coven the exchange of experience of past terroristincidents and mutual assistance in specific cases; the exchange of technical knowledge related to police work and research; the exchange of police personnel and greater co-operation in police training; and co-operation in aviation security,nuclear safety and the tackling of disasters, including fire. Proposals for giving effect to this programme will be submitted to a second conference of ministers that is expected to take place in May 1977 during the United KingdomPresidency of the Community.Section ID.  External Relations; Trade and AidGreece: Application for Membership of the EEC6. Negotiations on Greece&apos;s application for membership of the Communityopened formally in Brussels on 27 July. The first substantive meeting betweenthe Community and Greece at Ministerial level took place in Luxembourgon 18-19 October. This meeting was devoted largely to a discussion of the procedures to be adopted in the accession negotiations.GATT Trade Negotiations7. The conference of Heads of State and Governments held in Puerto Ricoin June 1976 reaffirmed that the aim should be to conclude the current round ofGATT Trade Negotiations by the end of 1977. These are ambitious and complex negotiations and progress has been relatively slow, but much usefulground work has been carried out both on tariffs and on a variety of non-tariff barriers to trade. The Commission represents the Community on the basis ofthe mandate adopted by the Council of Ministers in February 1975 and in thelight of regular co-ordination meetings with Member States.8. Particular attention is being paid in the negotiations to the problemsfacing the developing countries. On 5 April the Foreign Ministers&apos; Counciladopted a broadly based Community offer containing significant improvements in access for tropical products of interest to these countries. The concessions in the offer will be implemented from 1 January 1977.Maghreb9. Interim Agreements between the Community and Algeria, Morocco andTunisia took effect on 1 July, implementing the trade provisions of the Co-operation. Agreements signed in April. Other provisions, which include in-dustrial co-operation and financial aid from the Community, will enter intoforce when the co-operation Agreements have been ratified.Mashraq Countries10. Negotiations with Egypt, Syria and Jordan under the Community&apos;s&quot; overall approach &quot; to relations with countries of the Mediterranean Basinwere successfully completed in October. (Parallel negotiations with the Lebanonhave been held up because of the civil war). The new co-operation agreementswill comprise trade and aid provisions broadly similar to those in the Maghrebagreements, and it is hoped that signature will take place before the end of thisyear.%
brad11. Negotiations for financial and economic protocols to the 197S agreementwith Israel were completed in October. It is hoped that signature will takeplace before the end of the year.Spain12. The Community is considering a mandate for the resumption of negotia-tions on a revised trade agreement between Spain and the enlarged Community.Portugal13. An additional protocol to the e.c./Portugal free trade agreement and a five-year financial protocol were signed by Foreign Ministers in Brussels on20 September. The additional protocol supplements and expands the 1972trade agreement and extends the agreement to cover certain aspects of employ-ment, social security and financial, industrial and technological co-operation.An interim agreement was also signed at the same time to implement thecommercial provisions of the additional protocol by 1 November, in advanceof full ratification of the protocol. Portuguese Ministers have made clear their intention to apply for full membership of the Community in due course.Pakistan and Bangladesh14. A commercial co-operation agreement with Pakistan was signed inJune and entered into force on 1 July; a similar agreement was signed withBangladesh on 19 October. The provisions of both agreements are similar tothose already in force with India and Sri Lanka.IranIS. The Council of Ministers has endorsed the main lines of the Comnris-sion&apos;s proposals for a commercial and economic co-operation agreement withIran. Work continues in the Community on the preparation of a mandate forthe opening of negotiations.Canada16. The Framework Agreement for commercial and economic co-operationbetween the e.c. and Canada entered into force on 1 October.Japan17. The European Commission on behalf of Member States has been engagedin a number of consultations with Japan on a range of issues arising from thecontinued growth in the imbalance of visible trade between the community and Japan. The European Council on 29-30 November discussed these problems and issued a statement inviting the Community institutions to give urgent consideration to working ont solutions in co-operation with Japan.State Trading Countries- IS. In November 1974, the Community offered to engage in trade negotia-tions with each of the state trading countries for the conclusion of agreements to replace the previous bilateral trade agreements with individual e.c..countries.
In response, the Council for Mutual Economic Aid put forward the draft ofa possible agreement earlier this year, on behalf of its nine Member States.The Community replied on 17 November by putting forward its draft of anagreement and reaffirming its willingness to enter into negotiations at an early opportunity on the basis of the draft.Textiles19. The Community has concluded further agreements under the GATTMultifibre Arrangement with Egypt, Yugoslavia and Romania. negotiations are continuing with Mexico, and it is hoped to open negotiations shortly withHungary and Poland.Geaerattaed Scheme or Preferences20. The Commission^ proposals for the Community&apos;s Scheme of GeneralisedPreferences, which provides preferential access for developing countries toEEC markets were approved by the Council of Ministers in November 1976.The proposals provide for improved concessions, including increased quotasand ceiling limits for industrial products, except for the most sensitive items,eg footwear, and substantial extensions of the Scheme in the agriculturalsector, as foreshadowed in the EECa offer on Tropical Products in the GATTMultilateral Trade Negotiations. Many of these improvements will be ofparticular interest to the very poorest developing countries.21. For textiles the Council agreed that new arrangements will be introducedgiving more generous treatment to the lets competitive developing countries with some reduction of concessions for the most advanced of the developing countries.CDEC/UNCTAD22. After four meetings of the Commissions of the Conference on international Economic Co-operation during the first half of the year discussions on their work programmes for the remainder of the year continued during the summer until an agreement was reached which enabled the Commissions to resume their meetings in September. In pursuance of the resolution adoptedby consensus at UNCTAD IV on debt the Community has tabled proposals on the indebtedness of developing countries which are being discussed in theCIEC.23. The fourth meeting ofTJNCTAD was held in Nairobi in May. member states of the Community took part individually, but preparations andnegotiating positions were cloudy co-ordinated. One of the main areas ofdebate was Commodities, on which the conference adopted a resolution calling for preparatory meetings leading up to a negotiating conference by march 1977 on a Common Fund, and preparatory meetings for international legislation on individual products to be completed not later than February1978. Work is currently in progress to establish common positions withinthe Community in these areas. The first individual canmodhy meetings-oncopper and jute-have already been held in Geneva. The Trade and Devdop-ment Board, the regular continuing UNCTAD mechanism betweenConferences, met in Geneva in October.
The Lome Convention24. The first meeting of the ACP/e.c. Council of Ministers was held in brussels in July. A further meeting between the Presidents of the e.c. Counciland the Council of ACP Ministers to discuss a number of issues raised by theACP countries at the July meeting was held in October. During the latter halfof 1976 negotiations for accession to the Convention took place with Sao Tomeand Principe, Cape Verde and Papua New Guinea. The Comoros State, theSeychelles and Surinam, formally associated with the Community underPart IV of the Treaty of Rome, became parties to the Convention during thelatter half of 1976.25. Examination of the requests for transfers under the Community^Export Earnings Stabilisation Scheme (STABEX) has been completed and thefirst transfers were made in July: the payments covered falls in import earningson nine products from seventeen ACP States. The Commission also madeprogress in drawing up indicative aid programmes for each of the original 46signatory ACP States, and projects are now being brought forward forconsideration and implementation.26. The Centre for Industrial Development provided for under the chapterof the Convention dealing with industrial co-operation should becomeoperational during the first half of 1977.Food Aid27. The United Kingdom put forward suggestions for &quot; A New strategy for Community Food Aid to Developing Countries &quot; with a view to improving the developmental impact of food aid. The paper was taken into account bythe Council of Development Ministers on 8 November in discussing Commissionproposals for a three-year forward plan for food aid.Aid for Non-Associated Countries28. The Council of Ministers (Development) agreed on 8 November to spend the 20 mua inserted by the Assembly into the 1976 Budget. The moneywill probably be spent on projects in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lankaand Bolivia and a grant to the Asian Development Bank for technical assistance.29. For 1977 the Council has agreed to include a provision of 30 mua inthe draft budget, but the use of this money as the first stage in a continuingprogramme will require a further decision by the Council.Section IV.  Agriculture and FisheriesMonetary Arrangements30. During this period there have been further marked changes in therelative market rates of Community currencies thus increasing the differencebetween these rates and the green rates used for converting the support pricesunder the Common Agricultural Policy. The Commission proposed at themeeting of the Council on 4-5 October that the sterling green rate of exchangeshould be devalued by 4-5 per cent and that the Irish green rale should be
devalued by 7-6 per cent, but only the proposal relating to the Irish greenrate was accepted. These proposals were debated by the House of commons on 22 October. At the Council on 25-26 October, a proposal to devalue the green krone by 4 per cent was accepted.31. The Commission also suggested that from I January 1977 an automaticmechanism for the adjustment of green currencies should be applied. Underthis proposal, ceilings would be introduced, at different levels for revaluingand devaluing countries, setting the maximum divergence between the greenand market rates. In addition, green rates would be periodically adjusted tobring them into line with market rates over a previous 18 month period. Theoperation of both these mechanisms would be subject to an overriding maximumpercentage adjustment, although the Council could decide to waive this rule in particular cases. The United Kingdom has maintained that adjustmentsis green currencies should be primarily a matter for the country most directly concerned.Diougfat32. In discussion of the problems arising from the drought the Councilagreed, in the interest of consumers, to suspend or reduce the common customstariff on imports of potatoes and a number of other vegetables and. in theinterest of farmers, to introduce a limited extension of intervention for cowsand to increase the subsidy on skim milk used for animal feed in the drought-affected areas. The Council also noted national measures taken by member states to alleviate the effects of the drought. These included an increase in theUnited Kingdom guaranteed prices for milk and for sheep and extra help tofanners to build reservoirs.MfflcProdocts33. The Commission put forward during the summer proposals for improving the balance in the Community market for milk products. These include alevy on producers, which would be collected on milk supplies to dairies and on direct sales of dairy products from farms; a corresponding tax on vegetableand marine oils and fats; grants for dairy farmers who undertake to stopmarketing milk or to convert to beef and sheep production; the suspension ofnational and Community aids to investment in the milk sector except in certainstrictly defined circumstances; Community aid for accelerated programmes forthe eradication of brucellosis, tuberculosis and bovine leukosis; Communityaid for milk in schools; and other measures to promote increased consumptionof milk and milk products. These proposals which were debated by theHouse of Commons on 22 October are under consideration in the Council.34. The Council has adopted a regulation providing aid for the privatestorage of certain protein products, and has brought to an end the schemefor the payment of deposits on imported and Conmumty-produced proteinsinvolving the incorporation of skimmed milk powder in animal feed.New Zealand Butter35. At its meeting in June the Council agreed upon arrangements for imports of New Zealand butter for 1978 to 1980 which had been debated by theHouse of Commons on 18 May. Tbe-quantities which may be imported in
1978, 1979 and 1980 under these arrangements are 125, 120 and 115 thousandtonnes respectively. Within these quantitites, imports in excess of 25 per cent of the United Kingdom market for direct consumption in the preceding yearmay be diverted, if necessary, to other uses. The Council also confirmed that Protocol 18 of the Treaty of Accession remains the basis for continuingimports of New Zealand butter after 1980.Cereals36. At its meeting in June the Council agreed upon a test for distinguishingbreadmaking and feed wheat to be used in the two tier system of interventionfor wheat which has been introduced in 1976-77 so as to achieve a betterrelationship between support prices for different feed grains.Sugar37. At its meeting in June the Council endorsed the agreement negotiatedwith the ACP countries for imports of sugar in 1976-77.Mutton asd Lamb38. The Council has continued its examination of the Commission^proposals on sheepmeat and in particular has considered an interim measure to improve conditions of intra-Community trade.Animal Health39. The Council agreed at its November meeting to modify the Community&apos;slegislation on trade in fresh meat and livestock so as to afford continued animal health protection for the three new Member States.40. The Council agreed at its November meeting a proposal to protectconsumers by setting maximum permissible limits for the extraneous watercontent of frozen chicken. This will come into force by the end of 1977.Hops41. The Council has agreed that the Commission should re-examine themarket situation for hops and make any necessary proposals for improving the balance of the market. These are under consideration.Processed Tomatoes42. The Council agreed in May upon the minimum price for imports oftomato concentrate from third countries in 1976-77. A special lower price stillapplies to imports into the new Member States. In July the Council extended tocanned peeled tomatoes the accession compensatory amounts payable on exports to the three new Member States; this is to the benefit of UnitedKingdom consumers.Agricultural Structure43. The Council continued its examination of Commission proposals onaid to improve the marketing and processing of agricultural products, onproducer groups, on aid to young fanners and on forestry.
Ftsbarks44. On 27 July the Council agreed a declaration of intent on the extensionof Member States&apos; fisheries limits. In this declaration, the Council endorsed the principle of concerted action on extension, and agreed that a decision onthe ways of implementing such action should be taken in the light of the outcome of the next session of the UN Law of the Sea Conference. On 30 October,a meeting of Community Foreign Ministers in The Hague agreed that fisherieslimits would be extended to 200 miles in the North Atlantic and North Sea from1 January 1977. Agreement was also reached on general negotiating directivesfor the conclusion of fisheries agreements with third countries, and theQtptmgskffl subsequently entered into negotiations with a number of third countries, including Iceland and Norway. A Fishery Limits Bill was published by the Government at the end of November.45. The Commissions proposals for the revision of the Community&apos;internal fisheries regime provide for an extension both in time and geographicalscope of the derogations in Articles 100 awl 101 of the Act of Accession so as toestablish a uniform 12 mile exclusive band around the coasts of Member States,within which the historic rights of other Member States would be preBewed.Catches in the remaining waters under the fisheries jurisdiction of member states would be regulated primarily by means of quotas. The proposals are under consideration by the Council.Section V.  Economic and Monetary questions the 1976* Budget46. A supplementary budget was adopted in June to provide for Communityassistance towards the costs of reconstruction in Italy following the earthquakein the Friuli region in May.

It was returned to the Council with the Assembly*s observationsand proposals on 29 October.   The Assembly adopted amendments and
modifications which would increase the total budget by 584 mua to 9,299 mua.The Council of Ministers on 23 November agreed to 72 mua of the increases proposed by the Assembly; the draft budget has been returned to the Assemblyfor further consideration before it is finally adopted by 19 December.Economic awl Monetary Co-operation50. At their regular meetings Community Finance Ministers have continuedto discuss the economic and financial situation within the Community; and thissubject was also discussed by the European Council on 29/30 November. TheFinance Ministers have also exchanged views on the North-South dialogue,particularly the problem of indebtedness. In July they adopted a decision onthe preparation of public budgets for 1977 which laid down economic andbudgetary guidelines to be followed by Member States. In September they agreed on a Community position for the annual meeting of the international monetary Fund m Manila. They also approved the consolidation of$100 million, borrowed by the Community at a floating rate under the JointCommunity Borrowing scheme, into fixed interest notes. In November theyadopted the annual report on the economic situation in the Community, con-taining economic policy guidelines for 1977.51. There has been extensive discussion of proposals launched by theNetherlands Minister of Finance, for greater convergence of economic and monetary policies. These include relating the economic policies of member states to the Fourth Medium-Term Economic Policy programme, with Com-munity credit facilities being used in support of this objective, and the develop-ment of a Community framework for consultation and surveillance of exchange rate policies, based on the IMF &quot; guidelines for Floating &quot; and the concept ofagreed &quot; target zones&quot;. After considering the advice of the MonetaryCommittee and the Economic Policy Committee on these proposals, the finance ministers agreed on 8 November that further work should be done in developingcertain of Dr. Duisenberg^ ideas.52.

In October a Council of Fiscal Ministers agreedthat the proposed Directive should allow Member States to retain particularfeatures which are important in their national VAT systems. Further dis-cussion will be needed on the draft Directive (and subsequently on the detailedmechanisms of the &quot; own resources &quot; system) before final agreement can bereached.55. The Commission has proposed to extend from 30 June 1977 to31 December 1977 the first stage in the harmonisation of excise duty oncigarettes, because agreement on the second stage has not yet been reached.The United Kingdom has a derogation until the end of 1977 in respect ofharmonisation of tobacco duties.Section vi.

Foreign Ministers continued their work on the draft Community agree-ment providing for direct elections to the European Assembly. At the Julymeeting of the European Council, the major decision on the distribution of seats between the Member States was taken. The United Kingdom will have81 seats in an Assembly of 410. Subsequent meetings of Foreign Ministerssettled the remaining questions thus paving the way for signature of the agree-ment on 20 September. The full text of the Decision and Act was published in a White Paper (Command 6623) in the European Communities series on11 October.81. Meanwhile the Select Committee on Direct Elections in their second and third reports (published on 3 August and 25 November) made a number of recommendations concerning the implementing legislation, the electoralsystem for the first elections, the procedure to be used for the definition ofconstituency boundaries and the allocation of seats between the constituent parts of the United Kingdom. The Government are considering these re-commendations. The Oueen&apos;s Speech delivered on 24 November referred tothe Governments intention to introduce legislation during the current sessionof Parliament to make provision for direct elections.BffhtofEataUlabment82. Work has continued on the mutual recognition of qualifications andthe co-ordination of other measures to enable professional people to be employed and to practice anywhere within the Community. Proposals concerning lawyers,nurses, midwives and architects are under consideration.Passport Union83. Progress has been made towards the adoption of a uniform style for thenational passports of Member States. There are still detailed matters oon-cerning the design and layout to be settled by further discussion. MostMember States expect to be in a position to introduce the uniform style ofpassport in 1978, although the date of introduction in the United Kingdomremains open.Special Rfgfaoi84. In accordance with the Communique of the Heads of Governmentmeeting in Paris in December 1974, a study has been undertaken of the poss-responsibility of granting e.c. nationals residing in other Member States certain specialrights. It has been decided to concentrate first on the right to vote in localgovernment elections. Other matters, such as freedom of expression and freedom of association, may also be considered,
European Court of Justice85. The Government have continued to examine cases coming before theEuropean Court with a view to identifying those which raise questions ofinterest to the United Kingdom. During the period under review, the UnitedKingdom has intervened, for the first time, in a direct action. Observationswere submitted in a farther five cases, two of which were the first references tothe European Court under the Interpretation Protocol to the e.c. JudgementsConvention. The Court accepted submissions by the United Kingdom to theeffect that, although not yet parties to the Convention or the Protocol, the new member States were entitled to submit observations.86. On 15 June 1976 the Court gave its ruling in the case of EMI Records vCBS, a case referred to it by a Court in the United Kingdom. On the substance of the case the Courfs ruling upheld the view advanced by the Government that community law does not prohibit the proprietor of the same trade-mark in allthe Member States of the Community from exercising his rights so as to preventinfringements from third countries. Among the cases on which the Courtgave a ruling during the period under review, Defrerme v Sabeiia (concerningequal pay), Watson and Belmann (relating to the rights and duties of EECnationals visiting other member countries) and three linked cases concerningnational catch quota arrangements for fisheries all raised issues of considerable importance to the United Kingdom. The Court&apos;s rulings in these cases may beregarded as generally satisfactory from the point of view of the United Kingdomand as justifying the Governments decision to intervene in them.Economic and Social Committee87. In October Mr. B. de Ferranti was elected President of the Committeefor the next two years.Section XIII. Partiament and the European Community88. On 19 May 1976, the House of Commons debated the procedures forscrutiny of e.c. documents and for debate of those recommended by the scrutiny Committee. The Lord President of the Council undertook in thatdebate to make a further statement of the Goveramenfs views. In a writtenanswer given on 4 August, the Lord President outlined the government&apos;s proposals for changes in procedures. The Government has acknowledgedthe need for the backlog of outstanding items for debate to be reduced as faras Parliamentary time permits, and for proposals for e.c. legislation to be debated at an early stage. Arrangements are being made for the House to beinformed of changes in the substance of proposals involving major policydevelopments so that the Scrutiny Committee may have the opportunity toexamine them further.89. From 1 May to 30 November 1976, the House of Commons ScrutinyCommittee examined and reported on 410 Community documents, and theHouse of Lords Scrutiny Committee on 398. Of these, the House of CommonsCommittee recommended that 88 documents were sufficiently important to warrant further consideration by the House. The House of Lords madesimilar recommendations so far as 24 documents were concerned. debates on 58 documents recommended by the Scrutiny Committee were held in theHouse of Commons during the period in question, and debates on 14 documentssimilarly recommended took place in the Lords. Reference to some of thesedebates has been made in the preceding paragraphs.30 November 1976
