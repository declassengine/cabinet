THjg DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government cp(76) 13213 December 1976CABINETMARATHON (UK) LIMITEDNote by the Secretary of State for scotland i attach for consideration, a note about the very difficult situation whichhas arisen at the Marathon Oil Rig Yard at Clydebank.    I am bringingthis matter to Cabinet now because of the urgency: other currentMinisterial commitments preclude prior discussion of my proposals byEl Committee.COPY NO     8J[B MScottish Office13 December 1976
CONFIDENTIALCABINETMARATHON (UK) LTDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland-    Marathon (UK) Ltd are now within days of completing their last order, aJack-up rig for Abu Dhabi which left their yard at Clydebank on 8 December for final fitting out on the lower reaches of the Clyde.     They have no immediate prospect of further work and although a recovery in the market for explorationdrilling rigs ia expected before long, they therefore propose to pay oXT theouik of the labour force of 1,*tOO and mothball the yard.     The issue for Governmentis whether v;e wish to keep this company in existence in the UK to build drillingrigs.     If so it will need Government support to stimulate orders until the marketrevives.     The management have issued redundancy notices affecting 1370 employees^th 1,050 to take effect on 1? December.2.     The company claim that, early in 1976* before the redundancy provisions ofthe Employment Protection Act came into force, they gave notice of redundancy toftil their employees because of a shortage of work.    They have taken the view thatthis notice still stands, and so they are not subject to the requirement of atleast 90 day period for consultation with unions and notification of theGovernment.     The Department oi Bnployment, however, has doubts whether thecompany has satisfied the notification requirements, at least for the koo^loyeea until recently supported by the temporary employment subsidy;    it doesftot know whether the unions would take a similar view with regard to the periodof consultation, and whether they would then seek to enforce their rights to90 days pay.     If the company felt itself constrained to continue the employment0* its whole labour force for the full 90 days, this would cost about  im and could conceivably result in liquidation without even such preservation of facilities as would be achieved by mothballing.
3.     The Marathon Company of Houston, an established rig building company inthe United States, took over the Clydebank yard in July 1972 from Upper ClydeShipbuilders following the bankruptcy.     The company have concentrated on building oil exploration rigs of the jack-up type which is the standard instru-inent for exploration in water depths up to 300 feet.    They have designs also for mini-eemi-subraersible rigs which they have not yet built but which would be suitable for drilling in deeper water.     They are the only company in theUnited Kingdom manufacturing this type of equipment and their product is suitablefor exploration drilling in the southern part of the North Sea, the Moray Firth,Cardigan Bay, the Celtic Sea and the South Western approaches.     It has animportant market overseas and all of the rigs made in Clydebank so far nave beenexported.4.     The company has, apart from Clydebank, two yards in the United States andone in Singapore.     They have a high reputation for their equipment and theirdrilling rig is one of the leading designs on the world market.     When they took over the Clydebank yard they were given substantial assistance by the lastGovernment amounting to  6 million in loans and preference ehares.5.     Despite losses in the early years which were aggravated in 1974 through theeffects of the three day week, the company has made remarkable progress in improving their productivity and efficiency.     At the outset a large rig took820,000 man hours to build but by the end of 1975 this had been reduced to690,000 - striking distance ox the figure achieved by Marathon Singapore.    Withthe exception of its first rig and a drillehip conversion with which theystarted operations each of company&apos;s rigs has been built at a profit anddelivered on time.     A net trading profit of  134.000 was achieved in 1975 andthe unaudited profit for the first six months of 1976 was  55,000 despite ashortage 01 work during part of that time.     Despite the Clyde&apos;s reputation for labour difficulties the company managed to slim its labour force from 2,000 tothe current level of 1,400 vdth only one total stoppage - h days in 1974 - since
the company began operations.   This labour force is sufficient to build tworigs simultaneously in the yard and has therefore been substantially surplus to requirements in the last six months when the yards final order, theAbu Dhabi rig, was being completed.6.     The reason for the present difficulty is the world wide shortage oforders for all types of exploration drilling equipment.   All of the company^yards are affected, not only Clydebank.   When this situation became apparentin the early part of this year we provided a Government indemnity to assistthe company in securing an order from Abu Dhabi.   This order which is thefinal one now being completed has been ahead of schedule and productivityhas remained good.   Despite the uncertainty with no further work on the orderbook good industrial relations have been maintained and the Governmentindemnity will only be called upon to meet the cost of laying off labour inthe event of no further work following on.7.     The company*s main prospect of new work is an order for a rig on whichit is negotiating with Petro Baltic, a Russian, East German and Polishconsortium.   The only competition is from Finland.   Marathon rates itschances of success at 50*50, but does not expect a decision in less than three months.   If in the meantime the yard were mothballed through lack ofwork its chances of securing the Petro Baltic order, or indeed any other,would be greatly reduced.   Another possibility is a repeat order from theNational Drilling Company of Abu Dhabi who have said that they will beplacing an order for a specialist rig in 1977 worth 020 million and have indicated their hope to continue business with the Clydebank yard.8.     In the longer term there is a general agreement confirmed by Departmentof Energy assessments that the market for offshore drilling equipment willrecover.   As the world price of oil rises many countries are likely to intensify their exploration effort offshore and the offshore supplies officeexpect that the market for jack-up rigs, which are cheaper and less seriously3*
over-subscribed than semi-submersibles or drillships, will be the first to recover.It is hard to predict with any accuracy when this recovery will take place but a continued shortage of orders through the first half of 1977 seems inevitable.9.     If Marathon are to be kept in being at Clydebank and to have any chance ofsecuring these valuable orders for our own offshore or for export when the recovery comes, some sort of bridging operation by Government would be required.The cost of placing an order would be approximately  12 million, hut there wouldbe a fair chance that the full cost of the order could in due course be trans-ferred to Petro Baltic or some other customer.   At worst there would be a com-pleted rig available for charter and for eventual sale through which a substantial proportion of the cost if not the whole of it would be recovered.   If on theother hand the yard is closed, in the present climate of high unemployment therewill be a certain cost in unemployment pay and loss of tax revenue of  3-4 million a year without considering the secondary effects on suppliers of equipment.There could also be a claim of  jm on the Government indemnity to meet 503* of thecost of 90 days&apos; wages due under the Bnployment Protection Act; and if the companygoes into liquidation inctead of meeting its share of the liability there wouldbe a claim of about  1m on the redundancy fund.10.   I recognise the danger that our treatment of this yard may be thought to seta precedent for the shipbuilding industry which is beset by equally grim prospects.On the other hand our failure to act at Clydebank would have widespread political repercussions and would certainly greatly intensify pressure to avoid shipyardclosures on the Clyde notably at Scotetoun whose record is in every respect muchinferior to Clydebank.11.   I believe that Marathon is a special case which should be treated separately from general shipbuilding problems, both because the company is not included inour nationalisation plans and because it produces specialist equipment for the oil industry which is not made elsewhere in the UK.   As the major oil producing
country in Western Europe it is a cause for criticiom that our industry has notproduced far more of the large number of rigs and drillships now used on ourown waters.   Quite apart from the important export opportunities there willplainly be further requirements for this equipment in support of our owndeveloping oil and gas industries which will be a burden on our balance ofpayments if it all has to be imported.   For this reason there are energy policyconsiderations as well as industrial grounds for ensuring the continued existence of the OK&apos;a only major producer of exploration rigs.   For these reasons I propose that we maintain it on a minimum basis co that it will bethere to take orders in the future.   A condition of supporting it would be thatthe labour force be further cut from 1,400 to 800, the number that would berequired for construction of a single rig instead of two simultaneously.   If wecould keep it going for nine months on this basis, there would be a good chance that it would survive to benefit from the market recovery.12.     In view of the energy considerations I suggest that the best way of ensuringcontinued work at Marathon is by asking BNOC to place an immediate order.   BNOChas not developed exploration capacity as yet and would not readily place anorder unless financed by Government to do so but they have a substantial stakehow in a number of oil fields and will play an increasingly important part in development of the continental shelf in the years ahead.   BNOC would be free touse the rig or to charter it in the event of it remaining unsold by the time of completion and their involvement would help to avoid setting an awkward precedent for the shipbuilding industry in general.13.    The financing of such an order could be undertaken through Industry Actassistance.   Of the total production cost of some  12m (say  13m allowingprofit for Marathon) about 509* represents the cost of imported materials whichcould not be provided by UK ocs&amp;itfacturors.   The expenditure would fall fairlyevenly over the building period of 9 months with the signing of a contractinvolving a 10  deposit.   Subject to Treasury borrowing consent, BNOC (and Marathon)
appear to qualify under section 10 of the Industry Act 1972 for credit arrange-mettts at lower than commercial interest rates through the banks.   The normal rateof credit of 809S of the total cost would in this case be reduced to 50^ to take account of the inadmissible cost of imported materials.   The remaining  6m couldqualify for loan assistance under section 7 of the 1972 Act but this is inexcess of the sum remaining available within my Department&apos;s estimates.   Thereis, in any case, no provision for major rescue cases in this vote and, as is normal,I therefore propose that a sum of  6.5m should be made available from the con-contingency fund, to be loaned through my Department on terms to he agreed with theTreasury, with the normal section 10 facilities being extended for theremaining  6.5m.i
