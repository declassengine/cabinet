Throughout the lifetime of this Government our central objective hasbeen to avoid massive deflation while at the same time to close our appallingtrade deficit, to stimulate growth, and to reduce the rate of inflation.    Theyremain our objectives, but it is now clear that the existing strategy designedto achieve these objectives as near collapse, as all our expectations aboutthe success of that strategy have been falsified.2.        This unpalatable fact has become irrefutably clear from eventsfollowing the July measures.    The objective of those measures was to secure a package &quot;which will re-establish confidence in our economic policies to a degree which enables us to build our reserves and avoid being forced to theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) to repay our drawings on $5.3 billionstandby11.    (CP(76)52, paragraph 4).    But as we now know, the package whichwas agreed has not satisfied the market.    Confidence, far from reviving,has further collapsed and we are now in the hands of the IMF.  At the sametime, the hoped for revival of manufacturing output is no longer expected.On the present strategy the October National Income Forecast (NIF) suggeststhat unemployment will not fall, but rise to if million by the end of next year,and remain there throughout 1978: that inflation will not fall to single digitsbut rise to 16 per cent up to mid-1977; gross domestic product (GDP) will grow at only just over half the rate forecast in July; the public sectorborrowing requirement (PSBR) will increase from an expected  9 billion in1977-78 to  10.5 -  11 billion.3.        The difficulties of entering an election period on such a scenario do not need spelling out: the disillusion of our own supporters, already strong, will grow apace.    Worst of all, still more than in 1969i the ability of union leaders to restrain the growth of wages in the wider interests of economic growth and social justice could disappear.    Without a new departure in policy whatprospect is there that the present pattern of the social contract can bemaintained ?4.        We are now faced with the need to change our policy.    There are ineffect two alternative strategies.1
A. DEFLATION5.        This is the course being urged upon us by the IMF, the opposition and a substantial majority of City, industrial and media opinion.    Our present negotiations with the Fund are simply about the quantum of deflation and itsloading as between 1977-78 and 1978-79.    The effect and consequences of themoftt   severe package of cuts which has been considered were discussed in cp(76) 112 and in Cabinet on 23 November (CM(76) 33rd Conclusions,Minute 2 refers) and do not need repeating here.    But even if we achievedthe much more modest figure of  1 billion off the PSBR (50 per cent of whichwould come from sales of Burmah Oil) three major objections would remain:i.       f j billion extra deflation could on a broad approximationbe assumed to lead to 25, 000 to 40, 000 unemployed at the beginningof 1978 in addition to the 1. 75 million predicted in the current NTF;    ^ii.       the associated non-PSBR conditions would entail a. tighterDomestic Credit Expansion (DCE) targets that would force us intoadditional deflation if net exports go lesB well than foreseen, forinstance, because of a large OPEC price increase; b. a formal andexplicit renunciation of any resort to import controls;ill.       there is a serious risk that a modest package, even ifacceptable to the IMF and the principal governments concerned would not satisfy the market and would lead us to the same conditions of currency instability as followed last summer&apos;8 5 billion standby and  2 billion package to reduce the PSBR.If this were to happen it would not then be open to us to adoptthe import control alternative.    The only option would befurther and more savage deflation.Further the timescale involved gives little prospect of reducing unemploymentin the lifetime of this Parliament.B. PLANNED EXPANSION6.        The crux of a more successful alternative must be a rapid andassured achievement of surplus in our balance of payments.    This will necessitate a resort to direct control over imports.    This is the only wayof escapting the necessity of further borrowing in order to finance our balance of payments deficit in the 18 months or so before North Sea oil andan export revival close the gap.7.        Officials   estimated in October that a scheme of general quotas would,on the assumptions of no retaliation and no tax increases, be likely to lead toa current surplus next year of  0. 8 billion (compared with the new NTFforecast of a deficit oi SLl. 5 billion), and of  4. 2 billion in 1978 (comparedwith new NTF forecast of  1 billion) unemployment reducing by 80, 000 in1977 and 190, 000 in 1978: faster growth of GDP and manufacturing output.(These figures may require some downward revision in the light of more recent developments; but their scale remains broadly correct.)
8.        Four serious arguments have been advanced against such controls:-i.      that they would be inflationary;ii.       that tbey would provoke retaliation;iii. that they would not overcome short term difficultiesin financing our trade;iv. that, if introduced, we Bhould lose the $3. 9 billionIMF loan and the possible Sterling safety net.9.        When we last discussed this matter in depth a majority of colleaguesfelt that the disadvantages of import controls outweighed their possiblebenefits,    I believe that recent events and the new NIF significantly alter thebalance of this argument.i.       Demand and Inflation.   It was suggested that a quotascheme would generate substantial excess demand for manufacturingoutput which could not be met by extra production: and one of thearguments advanced against their introduction was that drasticimport controls would be of no help to the employment situationif the economy was already growing at the maximum rate compatible with capacity restraint, and that a reduction in domestic demand would be essential.    But the new NIF now suggests a rate of growth2 per cent less than the assumptions on which the figures inparagraph 7 above were based.    The risks of a quota schemegenerating excess demand can therefore be discounted.ii.       Retaliation.   We are now in a situation which, under international economic law, justifies the use of import restraint -without the legal right of other countries to retaliate against us.The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Article XEexactly meets our present problem of an unmanageable deficit onthe balance of payments with inadequate and falling reserves.Of course, we should need the acquiescence of the european economic Community (e.c.) but, quite apart from recent Italianprecedents, the provisions of Articles 108, 109 and 104 are directly relevant.    We would of course have to promise to get rid of controls as soon as there was a significant turn-round in thebalance of payments and in our reserves - a promise that wouldmake extensive retaliation seem even more pointless.iii.       Short Term Financing of Trade.     The point is correctly made that it would be some nine months before import quotas made aserious impact on the trade balance.    To cover the intervening period I would propose the introduction of a severe scheme of import deposits of the kind already discussed in the ministerial committee on Economic Strategy, for a 9-12 month period, as an interim measure before the benefits of a quota scheme flow through.3
iv.      IMF Loan,   We clearly have to face the fact that such astrategy would involve a serious risk mat we would not be ablesuccessfully to negotiate the current IMF loan.    But this is ahigh risk situation in any event; and the IMF and its majorcontributors will understand the options which would presentthemselves to us if no help is forthcoming.    Whatever thereforemay be the negotiating posture which the IMF is presently adoptingwe should certainly not rule out the possibility of concludingarrangements for financial support including an extension of the$5. 3 billion credit and the establishment of a sterling safety net.Nevertheless we must be ready and be known to be ready to takeother direct measures including bilateral negotiations with majorofficial holders of sterling on the lines of the guarantees agreed in 1968, and the reintreduction of tight exchange controls.10.       We are agreed that there is no economic case for cutting the PSBRin terms of resources but we have of course to bear in mind the need to mitigate the effect on confidence, and to improve the international accepta-bility, of import controls.    We have also to consider the effect of reducingthe PSBR on the present high level of interest rates which are themselvesdamaging to employment.    Providing that such measures were linked withimport controls with their beneficial effect upon employment I would supportincreases in excise duty on tobacco, liquor, oil and in car tax.    We shouldalso consider whether to increase VAT generally.    Apart from the increases in revenue which would flow from these measures they would help in thereduction of imports.CONCLUSION11.       The outcome of the final negotiations with the IMF will criticallyaffect the fortunes of this Government during its life, and perhaps of theLabour Party over the next decade.    I believe that we should go to the IMFto seek their general agreement for an approach to GATT under Article XII,and to the European Economic Community for their support under Article 108.Such a strategy as I have outlined, incorporating import controls with theirbeneficial effects on unemployment and manufacturing output should be used as the basis for seeking early agreement of the TUC for a policy of incomerestraint up to July 1978, and I would propose that negotiations on this shouldbe set in hand immediately.    What is also essential is that the measureswhich we decide to take should he i. taken together and ii. should be implemented without delay.PSDepartment of the Environment30 November 19764
TREATY OF ROMECHAPTER 2-BALANCE OF PAYMENTSArticle 104Each Member Stale shall pursue the economic policy needed to ensure the equilibrium of its overall balance of payments and to maintain confidence inits currency, while taking care to ensure a high level of employment and a stable level of prices.Article 1051. In order to facilitate attainment of the objectives set out in Article 104,Member States shall coordinate their economic policies. They shall for thispurpose provide for cooperation between their appropriate administrativedepartments and between their central banks.The Commission shall submit to the Council recommendations on how to achieve such cooperation.2. In order to promote coordination of the policies of Member States in the monetary field to the full extent needed for the functioning of the common market, a Monetary Committee with advisory status is hereby set up. It shallhave the following tasks: to keep under review the monetary and financial situation of ihe member states and of the Community and the general payments system of the member Slates and to report regularly thereon to the Council and to theCommission; to deliver opinions at the request of the Council or of the commissioner on its own initiative, for submission to these institutions.The Member Stales and the Commission shall each appoint two members ofthe Monetary Committee.Article 1061. Each Member State undertakes to authorise, in the currency of the member State in which the creditor or the beneficiary resides, any paymentsconnected with the movement of goods, services or capital, and any transfers ofcapital and earnings, to the extent that the movement of goods, services, capital and persons between Member Stales has been liberalised pursuant to tliisTrcaty.The Member States declare their readiness to undertake the liberalisation ofpayments beyond the extent provided in the preceding subparagraph, in so faras their economic situation in general and the slate of their balance of payments in particular so permit.2. In so far as movements of goods, services, and capital are limited only byrestrictions on payments connected therewith, these restrictions shall be progres-sively abolished by applying, mutatis mutandis, the provisions of the Chaptersrelating to the abolition of quantitative restrictions, to the liberalisation of services and to the free movement of capital. .3. McmK-r States undertake not to introduce between themselves any newrestriction cm transfers connected with the invisible transactions listed in annex II! &apos;.&apos; ihis Treaty.
The progressive abolition of existing restrictions shall be effected in accord-ance with the provisions of Articles 63 to 65, in so far as such abolition is not.governed by the provisions contained in paragraphs 1 and 2 or by the Chapterrelating to the free movement of capital.4. If need be, Member States shall consult each other on the measures to betaken to enable the payments and transfers mentioned in this Article to beeffected; such measures shall not prejudice the attainment of the objectives setout in this Chapter.Article 107I. Each Member State shall treat its policy with regard to rates of exchangeas a matter of common concern.2. If a Member State makes an alteration in its rate of exchange which is inconsistent with the objectives set out in Article 104 and which seriouslydistorts conditions of competition, the Commission may, after consulting the monetary Committee, authorise other Member States to take for a strictly limited period (he necessary measures, the conditions and details of which itshall determine, in order to counter the consequences of such alteration.Article 1081. Where a Member State is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with difficulties as regards its balance of payments cither as a result of an overalldisequilibrium in its balance of payments, or as a result of the type of currencyat its disposal, and where such difficulties are liable in particular to jeopardise the functioning of the common market or the progressive implementation of thecommon commercial policy, the Commission shall immediately investigate theposition of the State in question and the action which, making use of all themeans at its disposal, that State has taken or may take in accordance with theprovisions of Article 104. The Commission shall state what measures it recom-mends the State concerned to take.If the action taken by a Member State and the measures suggested by theCommission do not prove sufficient to overcome the difficulties which have arisen or which threaten, the Commission shall, after consulting the MonetaryCommittee, recommend to the Council the granting of mutual assistance and appropriate methods therefor.The Commission shall keep the Council regularly informed of the situationand of how it is developing.2. The Council, acting by a qualified majority, shall grant such mutual assistance; it shall adopt directives or decisions laying down the conditions anddetails of such assistance, which may take such forms as;(a) a conceited approach to or within any other international organisations to which Member Slates may have recourse;(b) measures needed to avoid deflection of trade where the Slate which isin difficulties maintains or reintroduces quantitative restriction sagainstthird countries;(c) the granting of limited credits by other Member States, subject to their agreement.
During tlic transitional period, mutual assistance may also take the form ofspecial reductions in customs duties or enlargements of quotas in order to facili-tate an increase in imports from (lie Slate which is in difficulties, subject to theagreement of the States by which such measures would have to be taken.3. If the mutual assistance recommended by the Commission is not granted by the Council or if the mutual assistance granted and the measures taken are insufficient, the Commission shall authorise the State which is in difficulties totake protective measures, the conditions and details of which the commission shall determine.Such authorisation may be revoked and such conditions and details may be changed by the Council acting by a qualified majority. .Article 1091. Where a sudden crisis in the balance of payments occurs and a decisionwithin the meaning of Article 108 (2) is not immediately taken, the member state concerned may, as a precaution, take the necessary protective measures.Such measures must cause the least possible disturbance in the functioning ofthe common market and must not be wider in scope than is strictly necessary to remedy the sudden difficulties which have arisen.2. The Commission and the other Member States shall be informed of suchprotective measures not later than when they enter into force. The commission may recommend to the Council the granting of mutual assistance under Article108.3. After the Commission has delivered an opinion and the Monetary Com-mittee lias been consulted, the Council may, acting by a qualified majority,decide that the Stale concerned shall amend, suspend or abolish the protectivemeasures referred to above.CHAPTER 3-COMMERCIAL POLICYArticle 110By establishing a customs union between themselves Member States aim tocontribute, in the common interest, to the harmonious development of world trade, the progressive abolition of restrictions on international trade and thelowering of customs barriers.The common commercial policy shall take into account the favourable effect which the abolition of customs duties between Member States may have on theincrease in the competitive strength of undertakings in those States.Article 111The following provisions shall, without prejudice to Articles 115 and 116,apply during the transitional period:1. Member States shall coordinate their trade relations with third countriesso as to bring about, by the end of the transitional period, the conditions needed-for implementing a common policy in the field of external trade.
GATT TREATY18 ARTICLES XI AND Xllto certain groups of domestic consumers free of charge or at prices below the current market level; or&apos;(iii) to restrict the quantities permitted to be produced of anyanimal product the production of which is directly dependent,wholly or mainly, on the imported commodity, if the domestic production of thai commodity is relatively negligible.Any contracting party applying restrictions on the importation of anyproduct pursuant to sub-paragraph (c) of this paragraph shall give publicnotice of the total quantity or value of the product permitted to be importedduring a specified future period and of any change in such quantity orvalue. Moreover, any restrictions applied under (i) above shall not be such as will reduce the total of imports relative to the total of domestic production, as compared with the proportion which might reasonably beexpected to rub between the two in the absence of restrictions. In dcter-rnining this proportion, the contracting party shall pay due regard to theproportion prevailing during a previous representative period and to anyspecial factors&quot; which may have affected or may be affecting the trade inthe product concerned.Article XII *Restrictions to Safeguard the Balance of Payments -i1. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article XI, anycontracting party, injsrder to safeguard jls^externgljlnancial position andits balance of payments, may restrict the quantity or value of merchandisepermitted lo be imported, subject to the provisions of the following para-graphs of this Article.2. (a) Import restrictions instituted, maintained or intensified by a contracting party under this Article shall not exceed those necessary:(i) to forestall the imminent threat of, or to stop, a serious declinein its monetary reserves, or(ii) in the case.of a contracting party with very low monetaryreserves, to achieve a reasonable rate of increase in its reserves.Due regard shall be paid in either case to any special factors which maybe affecting the reserves of such contracting party or its need for reserves,including, where special external credits or other resources are availableto it, the need to provide for the appropriate use of such credits or resources,(fc) Contracting parties applying restrictions under sub-para-graph (a) of this paragraph shall progressively relax them as such condi-
article xii19tions improve, maintaining them only to the extent that the conditionsspecified in that sub-paragraph still justify their application. They shalleliminate the restrictions when conditions would no longer justify theirinstitution or maintenance under that sub-paragraph.3. (a) Contracting parties undertake, in carrying out their domesticpolicies, to pay due regard to the need for maintaining or restoring equi-librium in their balance of payments on a sound and lasting basis and tothe desirability of avoiding an uneconomic employment of productive resources. They recognize that, in order to achieve these ends, it is desir-able so far as possible to adopt measures which expand rather than contractinternational trade.(b) Contracting parties applying restrictions under this Article may determine the incidence of the restrictions on imports of different productsor classes of products in such a way as to give priority to the importationof those products which arc more essential.(c) Contracting parties applying restrictions under this Articleundertake:(i) to avoid unnecessary damage to the commercial or economic interests of any other contracting party;?(ii) not to apply restrictions so as to prevent unreasonably theimportation of any description of goods in minimum commer-cial quantities the exclusion of which would impair regularchannels of trade; and(iii) not to apply restrictions which would prevent the importationof commercial samples or prevent compliance with patent,trade mark, copyright, or similar procedures.(rf) The contracting parties recognize that, as a result of domesticpolicies directed towards the achievement and maintenance of full and productive employment or towards the development of economic resources,a contracting party may experience a high level of demand for importsinvolving a threat to its monetary reserves of the sort referred to in para-graph 2 (a) of this Article. Accordingly, a contracting party otherwisecomplying with the provisions of this Article shall not be required to with-draw or modify restrictions on the ground that a change in those policieswould render unnecessary restrictions which it is applying under thisArticle.4. (a) Any contracting party applying new restrictions or raising thegeneral level of its existing restrictions by a substantial intensification ofthe measures applied under this Article shall immediately after institutingor intensifying such restrictions (or, in circumstances in which prior con-sultation is practicable, before doing so) consult with tbe Contracting
20article xiiParties as to the nature of its balance of payments difficulties, alternativecorrective measures which may be available, and the possible effect of therestrictions on the economics of other conlraciing parties.(b) On a date to be determined by them,&apos; the ContractingParties shall review all restrictions still applied under this Article on thatdate. Bcginnjne; one year after tha^datc, contracting parties applyingimport restrictions under this Article shall enter into consultations of the type provided for in sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph with the Con-tbacting Parties annually.(c) (i) If, in the course of consultations with a contracting partyunder sub-paragraph (a) or (6) above, the Contracting Parties find thatthe restrictions are not consistent with the provisions of this Article or with those of Article XIII (subject to the provisions of Article XIV), they shall indicate the nature of the inconsistency and may advise that the rcstric-tions be suitablv modified.(ii) If, however, as a result of the consultations, the Contrac-ting Parties determine that the restrictions are being applied in a mannerinvolving an inconsistency of a serious nature with the provisions of thisArticle or with those of Article XIII (subject to the provisions of Article XIV)and that damage to the trade of any contracting party is caused or threatenedthereby, they shall so inform the contracting party applying the restrictions and shall make appropriate recommendations for securing- conformitywith such provisions within a specified period of time. If such contracting party docs not comply with these recommendations within the specified period, the Contracting Parties may release any contracting party thetrade of which is adversely affected by the restrictions from such obliga-tions under this Agreement towards the contracting party applying therestrictions as they determine to be appropriate in the circumstances.(d) The Contracting Parties shall invite any contracting party which is applying restrictions under this Article to enter into consultations with them at the request of any contracting party which can establish a prima facie case that the restrictions are inconsistent with the provisions of thisArticle or with those of Article XIII (subject to the provisions of ArticleXIV) and that its trade is adversely affected thereby. However, no suchinvitation shall be issued unless the Contracting Parties have ascertained that direct discussions between the contracting parties concerned have notbeen successful. If, as a result of the consultations vith the ContractingParties, no agreement is reached and they determine thai the restrictionsare being applied inconsistently with such provisions, and tlrat damage to the trade of the contracting party initiatin&quot; tin- procedure is caused or threatened thereby, they shall reconjiiw-^ witndrawal m Ja^inu.:/sf^,of the restrictions.  If the re&quot;-&apos;    -i* aie not withdrawn or modilied
articles xii and xiii21within such time as the Contracting Parties may prescribe, they mayrelease the contracting party initiating the procedure from such obligations under this Agreement towards the contracting party applying the rcslric-tions as they determine to be appropriate in the circumstances.(e) In proceeding under this paragraph, the Contracting parties shall have due regard to any special external factors adversely affectingthe export trade of the contracting party applying restriclions.*(J) Determinations under this paragraph shall be rendered expedi-tiously and, if possible, within sixty days of the initiation of the consulta-tions.5. If there is a persistent and widespread application of import rcstric-tions under this Article, indicating the existence of a general disequilibriumwhich is restricting international trade, the Contracting Parties shallinitiate discussions to consider whether other measures might be takeneither by those contracting parties the balances of payments of which are under pressure or by those the balances of payments of which are tending to be exceptionally favourable, or by any appropriate intergovernmentalorganization, to remove the underlying causes of the disequilibrium. Onthe invitation of the Contracting Parties, contracting parties shall partici-pate in such discussions.Article XIII *Non-discriminatory Administration of Quantitative RestrictionsI. No prohibition or restriction shall be applied by any contracting party on the importation of any product of the territory of any other contracting party or on the exportation of any product destined for theterritory of any other contracting party, unless the importation of the likeproduct of all third countries or the exportation of the like product to allthird countries is similarly prohibited or restricted.2. In applying import restrictions to any product, contracting parties shall aim at a distribution of trade in such product approaching as closely as possible the shares which the various contracting parties might be expectedto obtain in the absence of such restrictions, and to this end shall observe the following provisions:(a) Wherever practicable, quotas representing the total amount ofpermitted imports (whether allocated among supplying countries ornot) shall be fixed, and notice given of their amount in accordancewith paragraph 3 (b) of this Article;(i) In cases in which quotas are not practicable, the restrictions maybe applied by means of import licences or permits without a quota;
