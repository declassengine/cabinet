DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S government cp(76) 134 COPY NO     SI15 December 1976CABINETDEVOLUTION TO SCOTLAND AND WALES: POST-ASSENTREFERENDA /Memorandum by the Lord President of the council. On 9 December the Cabinet agreed that the details and implications of post-Assent referenda on devolution to Scotland and Wales should be examined by the Ministerial Committee on Devolution Strategy, with a viewto decisions by the Cabinet early in the New Year02.        Parliamentary developments now make it highly desirable for us tobe ready to move more rapidly.3. There are 130 signatures to a Second Reading Motion by Mr Leo Abseand others in the following terms :*&quot;That this House cannot approve the Scotland and Wales Bill unless a referendum is held before the BUI comes into effect to ascertain the wishes of the people of Scotland and Wales&quot;,Because of the support for this Motion, the Speaker was at one stage veryinclined to call it; and although it is defective in form, the Houseauthorities ruled that the effect of its carriage would have been to defeat theBill as it now stands.    In that event the Bill could have proceeded only bystarting again with referendum provisions included.4.        Following extended discussions with the Speaker, it now seemsalmost certain that the Motion will not be called.    But in view of the decreeof support for it - and there are indications that a lot of further names maybe added - its not being called will create wide-ranging resentment In theHouse, which, in my view, cannot but react unfavourably on the extent of support for the Bill at Second Reading.     I believe that referenda ondevolution are, in fact, now inevitable; and that, to ensure a sound position on Second Reading, we need to give a firm commitment to them, inprinciple, during Thursday,
5. I suggest that the terms of a statement might be on the followingline 8: -&quot;The Government have given further careful thought to the questionof referenda on the devolution schemes as they emerge from consideration by Parliament. &apos; My rt hon Friend the PrimeMinister promised the House, when he opened this debate onMonday, that the House would be given a full and early opportunityto consider this important Issue in the light of clear proposals by theGovernment.    I can now say that these proposals will be based uponacceptance of the principle that referenda should be held in Scotlandand Wales before the respective schemes can be put into effect.We shall bring forward new clauses accordingly, at committee stage, for the consideration of the House,At that stage the House will need to discuss carefully the detailedfeatures of referenda.    We shall have to address such issues as the precise question or questions to be put, the arrangements forcounting, and other aspects such as those the Houbo will recall from our discussions on the referendum on the European Communityrenegotiation.    These are complex matters, which cannot safely bedecided now.    The Government will cover them in thoroughlyworked-out proposals at Committee Stage&quot;,6.        As the Annex to CP(76) 135 indicates, there will be many detailedaspects of the referenda on which we shall need to reach conclusions before putting our proposals to the House.    But at this stage only the decision inprinciple Is needed.7.        I invite the Cabinet to agree that at a suitable stage tomorrowafternoon we should announce, in the terms set out in paragraph 5 above,that the Government will introduce at Committee Stage proposals for post-Assent referenda in Scotland and WaleB.M FPrivy Council Office15 December 1976
