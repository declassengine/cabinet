DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAjESTY&apos;S government cp(76) 13113 December 1976CABINETECONOMIC MEASURES AND THE IMFNote by the Chancellor of the exchequer. I attach a draft of the Statement to the House which I wish tomake on Wednesday 15 December.2.        The Statement in its present form is subject to minor alterationof language and of presentation, and in particular it does not include figuresof the individual savings.    These are to be listed in a table to appear in theOfficial Report, a copy of which is attached.    I am BtiU considering how bestfigures or details could be added to the Statement itself.COPY NO       23D W treasury Chambers13 December 1976
1.      With permission Mr. Speaker, I shall make astatement about the further measures which the Governmentare taking to promote the Nation&apos;s economic recovery andto achieve the fastest possible return to a high andsustainable level of employment.2.      The measures I announced .to the House on July 22ndaimed to ensure that the essential increase of output,exports and investment in our manufacturing indusrty was not threatened by excessive borrowing in the public sector.      Their objective was to get the   PSBR      downto  9 billion in 1977/78 or about 6% of GDP as thenforecast at current market prices.3.      Since then the economic outlook, both of Britainand the world as a whole,has darkened considerably.Nearly all industrial countries suffered a check in their economic recovery during the summer; and, although recoveryhas resumed they foresee a lower growth next year bothin their trade and output than they expected a few month&apos;sago.      Since Britain*s growth must be based primarily on exports the lower increase in world trade must by itself reduce the prospects for growth in the British economy.     In addition, sterling has had a very troubledyear, and since July has depreciated again.    During OctoberSECRET J this
this further depreciation was as much as 12 per cent,though recently sterling has improved and this figure iscack to 6 per cent.    Even at this level, the depreciationworsened the outlook for inflation and will tend to reducedomestic der.and in real terms.    Moreover, the difficultywe faced during&quot; the Ipst summer in financing &apos;the public sector borrowing requirement by means which did not refuelinflation has required us to increase interest rates tolevels which, if they had to be maintained without anyclear prospect of relaxation, could have serious consequences for industrial activity and investment.*t - These developments have undermined businessconfidence and damaged the prospects for inflation andemployment.      The combination of lower growth and higherinterest rates now make it likely that without further action the PSBR next year would be about  103, billionas against the  9 billion we expected following the july measures.      Moreover, this increase in the moneyvalue of the PSBR represents a bigger increase in the share it takes of GDP, since GDP is likely to be lower.We therefore nead to r-ake adjustments in our plans whichwill keep our economic recovery on course and restore confidence both at home and abroad.    We must be able toavoid the sort of pressure on the exchange rate we have seen this year and re-establish control over domesticmonetary conditions while looking forward to aSECRETJ gradual
gradual but steady decline in interest rates. Bothof these objectives require us to reduce the size ofthe PSBR as now foreseen.5.      Meanwhile we need to replenish our reserves afterrepaying our drawings of $1.5^5 billion on the swapfacility set up in June.      We must also finance the external deficit still to be expected next year beforethe increase in oil production from the North Sea andour increasingly effective competition with foreignproducts, both in domestic and international markets)move our balance of payments into substantial surplusby 1978.      It   is   for these reasons that the Governmenthave applied for a standby credit from the international monetary Fund and begun talks about the sterling balances.      A successful outcome of these discussionswill in itself give us much more stability in theexchange markets and help to restore both internal and external confidence.6. If, on the other hand, we were to fail in makingthe necessary adjustments to our plans, then we would/fail...
fail to satisfy our financing requirement at homeand abroad.      Such a failure would destroy all ourhopes of achieving our objectives for economic recovery and a return to higher employment.      Inthat case all the sacrifices we have made in thelast few years would have been in vain, all thegains we have already achieved in the social andeconomic fields would have gone to waste.The Government is determined that the necessary adjustments shall be made - and that they shall besufficient to guarantee success.      But it is determinedalso that in making these adjustments it does notjeopardise either the Social Contract on which the fight against inflation must depend or put at risk theindustrial strategy which is the foundation of ourhopes for reversing the decline in the relativeperformance of our manufacturing industries.      For thisreason, though painful   reductions in expenditure mustbe sought in many areas, the Government will be increasingfurther measures to helpexpenditure on/employment and on industry.      And ithas decided to spread the adjustment needed over twoyears not one, so that the reductions in public expenditure are greater in the second year when output is/likely..
likely to be rising faster.    We are thereforeconcerned to see that resources freed by reductions in lower priority expenditure shouldbe absorbed as fast as possible in productiveindustry.    The measures I shall now describewill cover the next two years.    But we need a medium programme for national recovery toensure that we enter the 1980&apos;s with the prospectof an economy fully restored to balance, with high levels of output, employment and real wagesand an industry which is vigorous, expanding andprofitable.SECRET
Reduction in the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement9-      The immediate objective of the measures which I amannouncing this afternoon is to reduce the public sectorborrowing requirement to about  8.7 billion in 1977/78 andsomewhat  &apos;lower in money terms in the following year.Expressed as a percentage of GDP it will fall steadily,from       9% in the current year to       6% in 1977/78 and51% in 1978/79.      On this basis we can look forward to a steady reduction in the rate of domestic creditexpansion, accompanying and reinforcing the reduction inthe rate of inflation, from a figure now put at  9billion in the current year to some   7.7 billion nextyear and   6 billion in 1978/79.10.    These objectives are calculated on the basis of theeconomic prospect as I now see it.      If the forecasts atthe time show the economy growing from the beginning of1978 to the end of 1979 at a rate of more than 3h% a year,I intend to make a further fiscal adjustment in the 1978Budget - of between  j billion and  1 billion, depending on the buoyancy of demand at that time - to ensure thatdomestic conditions do not obstruct the shift of resourcesinto exports and investment.
Expenditure or Taxation11.    The fiscal adjustment in both years will come mostlyfrom savings in public expenditure rather than increases in taxation.      This is for two reasons.      First, althoughthe level of our public expenditure, as a proportion ofGPD, is no higher than in some other industrialised countries,it has grown much more rapidly in recent years than our industrial output, and our industrial output itself is relatively low.      Second, and perhaps this is not unconnected with our low level of industrial output, people at work arealready highly taxed on their incomes, and face a furtherdrop in their living standards in the coming year.      I donot believe it would be right to burden them with the lion&apos;s share of the fiscal adjustment which is now necessary.;and inadequate financial incentives to work and to investco^ld put our economic recovery at risk.12.    Savings in public expenditure must therefore produceby far the greater part of the adjustment needed.     On theother hand, the savings needed are on nothing like thedraconic scale suggested by some outside commentators.      Ithink that there has been a growing consensus among responsible]economists that savage and indiscriminate cuts of that order
15.    In order to achieve the PSBR and DCE targets-to whichi have referred, we have now decided to reduce public expenditure programmee further by 11 billion in 1977/78 andSX\ billion in 1978/79 at 1976 Survey prices.     The details are being circulated in the Official Report and areavailable in the Vote Office, but I will now describe themain changes.would do irreparable damage both to the structure of oursocial services and to the prospects for employment.      Theywould imply a massive and immediate contraction of demandwhich is the last thing British industry wants to see atpresent.Public Expenditure13.    The White Paper which we published in February thisyear set our medium-term strategy for public expenditure.1*1.    Pursuing this strategy, we have held expenditure inthis financial year within the planned level by the rigorousapplication of cash limits, new arrangements for regularconsultation with the local authorities, and our determination to keep within the contingency-reserve.      We have alsocarried out the 1976 public expenditure Survey on the basisof keeping within the White Paper plan for each year, taking account of our July measures as far as 1977/78 is concerned.
716.    Once again we have avoided mechanical cuts acrossthe board and have not reduced the main social security benefits, although we are concerned about the narrowinggap between them and the income of those in work.      Publicservice pensions will, however, produce a cash saving,by uprating at less than full indexation in line with-prices as is at present required by the L9-71 Act.Further economies will be made in expenditure on theCivil Service both this year and next-^J^Loeal Authoritycurrent expenditure is now more strictly influenced by thecentral government through the recent reduction of the mainRSG from 65% to 61% in 1977/78. We are not re-openingthat settlement.Local Authority Capital Expenditure17.    But there will be a reduction in housing capital investment by local authorities, housing associations andnew towns.     This programme has grown rapidly, and without these adjustments there would have been a substantialoverspend both in 1977/78 and in 1978/79.18.    New construction will be suspended or curtailed in several other central and local government programmes,including roads, other environmental services, school building, Government accommodation, and capital spendingby the Water Authorities..
Community Land Act19- Borrowing approvals will be reduced to achieve a slowerbuild-up of land acquisitions under the Community Land Act.Food Subsidies20.    The planned programme for phasing out the Governmentsfood subsidies will be accelerated and will be completed in1977/78. -    The effect of this acceleration on the index of retail Prices will be 1 of 1 %.The Defence Budget21.    In an exercise of this magnitude, spending in supportof our external policies must inevitably play its part.Despite the big cuts which we have already made in defence expenditure, we cannot achieve the necessary reductions in public expenditure and the PSER without a major contribution from the Defence Budget.      The Secretary of State for Defencwill make a further statement in due course.Overseas Aid22.    There will be reductions in the provision for overseas aid which, until now, has been almost entirelyprotected from expenditure savings.    The Government havetaken this decision with great reluctance.    But the aid programme will continue to increase substantially in cashterms, and we do not expect any reduction next year inthe proportion of GNP devoted to aid.SECRET
Nationalised Industries23.    Under the new treatment of the nationalised industries on which we have consulted the Expenditure Committee, weshall in future be including in public expenditure theGovernment finance for these industries, rather than their investment programmes as such.     We intend to agree withthe industries action which will reduce this Governmentfinancing through increases in revenue as well as economies in spending.Regional Employment Premium2k.    As I told the House in July, the Government wants tomove progressively towards a more selective approachtowards assistance for industry.It is doubtful whether REP now fulfils the original purpose of attracting employment to the regions.     Wetherefore believe that it    should    now give wayto more selective measures and it willbe withdrawn by Statutory Order early in the New Year.I shall be describing in a moment other measures in theindustrial field designed to assist employment and investment.
Export Credit25.    The refinancing by the Government of fixed rateexport and shipbuilding credit imposes a major charge on public expenditure and the PSBR.   This has been growingrapidly, and is now forecast to exceed the figures in cmnd. 6393.    Partly to deal with this, I have asked the clearing banks to finance from their own resources anadditional  100 million of fixed rate sterling business in each of the next two years and I am glad to say theyhave agreed in principle to do so.    It remains a vitalpart of our economic strategy to encourage exports;   butwe believe that a lot can be done to reduce the burden of medium and long-term export credit on public expenditure,the PSBR and the balance of payments by financing inforeign currency instead of sterling.    We are thereforetaking steps to facilitate the use of foreign currencyfinancing and to control the rate at which new offers offixed rate sterling finance will be approved by ECGDwith the aim of reducing expenditure onrefinancing by  100 million in 1977/78 and  200 millionbelow that shown in Cmnd. 6393.in 1978/79,/ While on the subject of exports I should add that the Government are aware of the concern of industryabout the future of the cost escalation scheme which, asmatters stand, is due to end in March 1977.   We now propose that it should be continued for a further year./ The
SECRET7 7 &apos;The necessary draft order will be laid before the House indue course.    Our intention is to maintain the presentterms of the scheme for eligible contracts financed inforeign currency or sold for cash.    However, as anencouragement to financing in foreign currency the minimumthresholds of cover applicable to contracts financed bysterling credit will be increased by 2 per cent.26.    Revised expenditure programmes for 1977/78 and1978/79, taking account of these measures and of otheradjustments made during the public expenditure&apos;Survey,will be set out in the public expenditure White Paper indue course. - These decisions will reduce planned expenditure by a little over  1 and S,l\ billion in the next twofinancial years.
Measures to Help Employment and Investment27.    On the other hand, we have decided to add to expenditurein two areas which we believe should have the highest priority- incentives to increase industrial investment and expansion,and measures to reduce unemployment.28.    There will be a big increase in the resources of theNational Enterprise Board and the Scottish and WelshDevelopment Agencies.      A new selective investment scheme will be introduced to follow the very successfulAccelerated Projects Scheme.      It will give help to manufacturing companies for major projects designed toimprove capacity and performance.      I will allocate  100million to this scheme in the first instance;   the rate atwhich this is spent will depend on how many good schemescome forward for support.     The money will be spent over aperiod of years.     Further money will also be made availablefor additional sectoral schemes in support of the industrialstrategy, and for other measures to help industry.     taken together, I have allocated  80. million in each of the next2 years for these purposes.29.   There will be an increase of  120 million in 1977/78 inspending on measures to reduce unemployment.   New application;for the Temporary Employment Subsidy are due to closeat the end of this month and for the Job Creation Programmeshortly after.       We have decided to extend these two schemes to the end of April, and then to review their future along with the other new schemes which the GovernmentSECRET
has recently introduced.    This additional expenditure will fully offset the impact on unemployment during 1977of the other measures which I have announced and will mean that the net effect of the whole package willbe to reduce unemployment next year.Indirect Taxation30.    To finance the additional expenditure on investment and employment, I must look for some contribution from the specific Revenue duties, which are fixed in money terms and are therefore continually eroded by inflation.powers31.    I have decided to use my Regulator/ to increase byall10 per cent/the revenue duties charged on tobacco andthe Customs dutiesalcoholic drinks.    The increases will come into force for /on imported     tobacco at midnight tonight, and for theduties on tobacco products and drinks on 1 January.    Theywill have no effect on prices during the Christmas andNew Year holidays.32.    If fully passed on, these duty increases, taking into account the consequential increase in VAT, will addrather over J per cent to the RPI.   They will raise the taxcharge on a pint of beer of average strength by a littleunder lp, and on a standard bottle of spirits by about 31p*
Provisional:    see Mr.  Lord&apos;s submission of 10 DecemberThey will increase the charge on a standard bottle of tablewine by about 5p, and on a bottle of fortified wine such assherry by about 7p.      The tax on a packet of 20 filtercigarettes of average size will bo increased by about 4p.The additional revenue raised will be 150 million in theremainder of this financial year and  280 million in1977/78.33-    I believe the British people will accept these increases in the cost of less essential goods areunjustified at this time, particularly when the proceedsftre intended &apos; to create    more jobs and moreinvestment.Sale of BP Shares *Jik.      There is one further step which we proposed to take to reduce the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement in 1977/78.Two years ago the Government rescued the Burmah Oil company from severe financial difficulties, and as part of a packageof support the Bank of England bought&quot; Burmah1 s holding of shares in the British Petroleum Company.      These sharesamounted to just over 20% of BP&apos;s issued ordinary stock;taken together with the Governments existing holdingthere is now 68% of this stock in public hands.
35.    We now propose to sell enough of Burmah&apos;s formershareholding in BP to reduce this total holding to 51$.The acquisition of the ex Burmah BP shares counted as public expenditure at the time and it is reasonable thatwe should take credit for the sale as part of our presentmeasures.      As the House will be aware, the Burmah oil company have instituted proceedings against the Bank ofEngland for the return of the BP shares which theyformerly held.      Although we are advised in the firmestterms that    Burmah&apos;s claim is without merit, so long asit is being pursued it may prove an impediment to a successful sale.      We therefore hope that the Company canbe persuaded to withdraw the claim or to change its formso that it becomes a suit for damages rather than forrestitution.      But if the impediment is not removed,the Government will sell an equivalent number of BP sharesfrom their original holding, and in due course will make goodtheir holding by transferring to the Treasury an equivalentamount of the BP stock acquired from the Burmah Oil company and now held by the Bank of England.
1Incomes Policy36&quot; Thetwin pillars of the Government1s economic strategyarethe Social Contract with the trade union movement and the industrial strategy.    It has been, andcontinues to be, a common objective of the Governmentand the TUC to continue the attack on inflation.      Bythe middle of 1977 most of the effects on our price level of the sharp depreciation of sterling betweenMarch and October of this year will be behind us, andinflation should once more start falling.      To maintain a continued fall in inflation through 1978 we shall need agreement between the TUC and the Government on how to pursue the attack on inflation while permittinggreater flexibility in pay negotiation in the period after July 1977-      I hope it will be possible for us toreach agreement on this in time for me to take accountof the outcome in settling the levels of income tax inthe next Budget.
37-    If, at the time I settle ray Budget for 1977&quot;78I judge that we have over-estimated the size of the adjustment needed to reduce the PSBR to   8.7       billionand if, as I expect, a satisfactory agreement hasandbeen reached with the TUC /the CBI on the next pay round,then I propose to use the available margin to reducethe present burden of income tax which I believe to be too heavy, especially at the higher and lower earnings levels.38.    In this context there are also important questions, ,which I shall want to consider with the TUC and other interested bodies, concerning the interlocking effects of changes in earnings, social security benefits and ratesof direct and indirect taxation.Taxation of Export Earnings39.    There is one aspect of taxation      which I would liketo start considering at once.    I believe it is important to find ways of improving the tax treatment of employeeson increasing our export:who live in this country but who work abroad/   The peopleI want to encourage are those at the sharp end ofexporting - the business of selling British goods overseas -as well as those who contribute to our overseas earningsby working for a period overseas, for example inconstruction projects.    I have therefore asked the InlandRevenue to issue a Consultative Paper which will outlineproposals to give the reliefs which are at present allowed/ to those
to those with separate jobs abroad to anyone who works for a period abroad, and which will also modify the rules governing the allowance of expenses incurred abroad.    Ihave authorised them to seek the views of interested bodies, with a view to legislation being included innext year&apos;s Finance Bill.Domestic Monetary Effects40.    I have already described the targets for the PSBR. . which we have set for1977-78 and 1978-79 in order to create monetary conditionswhich will encourage investment and growth and will helpalsoto control inflation. We are^setting monetary targets expressein terms of Domestic Credit Expansion &quot;nther than money supplyperiod when we shall be seeking to put our balance ofpayments right, this will be more appropriate than a target for M3.    The IMF agree with this view.41. . - DCE will be kept to  [     9     ]billion20thin the year up to/April 1977 and  [7.7     Jbillion in the19thyear ending^ftpril 1978, and I expect a further reduction in the following year to  [  6.0      ]billion.The growth of M3 which will accompany DCE at these rates will depend on a number of factors, especially progress on the balance of payments.   For 1376/77 again on a bankingbasismonth, j the growth of sterling M3 is likely to be between B% and 13$. *t is too early to give an/ estimate
estimate for 1977/78.     But our targets will now be interms of DCE.1(2.    The major reduction in the PSBR between this year andnext means that the financing needs of the public sectorwill make a smaller demand on the available savings of thecommunity.     These targets for DCE should, therefore,provide sufficient room for the essential needs of industry for investment and industrial expansion.     I have made itclear in the Letter of Intent that I will review the targets in 6 months time to ensure that that is so.     It will,however, continue to be necessary to ensure that monetaryconditions do not imperil our other policies.     the supplementary Special Deposits scheme which I recentlyre-activated   will contribute substantially to this.Technical adjustments in either direction may be needed inthe Special Deposits field, depending on our success withgilt sales.     Their aim will be to preserve orderlyconditions in the money markets without relaxing controlover liquidity and the monetary aggregates.     I also hopethat our success with the IMF application and the measuresI am now announcing will make it possible to maintaincontrol of the monetary aggregates while reducing interest rates from present exceptional levels.     The reduction may need to be limited in the first instance but should gatherforce as our policies are seen to succeed in turning round the balance of payments and securing a further restorationin the rate of inflation.
Summary43-    To sum up, the Governmenfs measures amount to atotal fiscal adjustment of  1J billion in 1977-78.    Inaddition, the PSBR will benefit from the reduced cost of debt interest resulting not only from the lower borrowing requirement, but also from the lower level of interest rates to which I am confident that these measures will lead.    On this basis, taking account of the change in our prospects since last summer, I forecast that the PSBRwill be within the target of  8.7 billion described in theLetter of Intent./ M. For 1978-79SECRET
kk.    For 1978-79 the fiscal measures I have described takeus most, but not all of the way, towards the PSBR target of that year. A further fiscal adjustment of about  J billion will be needed to achieve the-target.        It is far too^ soon to say .whether that adjustment would be most appropriately puttaxation of on/public expenditure.    That will not be considered tillwell over a year from now.The Economic Prospect45.    I now turn to the economic effects of the measures.Taken by themselves without regard for their consequenceson the behavior of the economy as a whole, the reductions in public expenditure and increases in Revenue duties would tend to reduce growth and employment; on the otherhand the further measures which we are taking to reduce unemployment and   encourage investment will have anopposite effect.     The conventional economic arithmeticwould show an increase in unemployment next year ofabout [40,000] from the first set of measures and areduction in unemployment of about [60,000] from thesecond.     So on balance the net effect of the packagecould be to reduce unemployment next year by up to [20,000]The same conventional arithmetic would produce a figureof a net increase in unemployment of [100,000] by theend of 1978, if no further measures were taken meanwhile./But,
a,  /Z,But, as I have said, we shall be reviewing thefuture of Job Creation and temporary employmentsubsidy next April together with the possibilitiesof other schemes for reducing unemployment.Moreover the gradual fall in the interest rates which can be expected to follow the measures willin itself in due course generate more investment and more demand for goods like houses and consumerdurables which are critically affected by the rateof interest.46.    However, it will be clear from what I have already said to the House, that this kind ofarithmetic is seriously misleading in our presentcircumstances.     If we are to make a true comparison,we have to consider what would have happened if theGovernment had failed to take the measures which theeconomic prospect requires.     On that basis, theannouncedcomparison is clear and unambiguous.     The measures I have /will enable us to regain control of our currency andto open up a firm path towards overseas balance,greater stability of prices, and fuller employment.These cannot be achieved overnight.      But without/the measures
the measures they could not be achieved at all.47.    Dr. Witteveen, the Managing Director of theInternational Monetary Fund, has told me that hesupports both the economic strategy I have describedand the measures the Government are taking.      Hewill recommend the Executive Directors of the fund to accept my request for a stand-by credit of$3.9 billion.     I am circulating in the official report the text of my Letter of Intent to him.47a.    Before the Fund Board meets there will bea meeting of the so-called Group of Ten countries,who stand ready, under the General arrangements to Borrow, to provide the Fund with the useable currenciesit needs for large drawings if its own availablecurrencies are inadequate.    I am confident that,in a matter of days after the end of the year,the operation will be complete and the reservesreplenished.47b.    The standby arrangements this time cover a two year period, so that we can have a steadierpace of adjustment.    In total we shall be able todraw up to nearly $4 billion, of which about $1 billionimmediately and about $1J billion more before the endof 1977 or over $1J billion more during the financialyear 1977/78.   This, I am confident, will transformthe external financing position in 1977*SECRRT
.BE DRAFTED48. ^Safety netaand I believe that thisendorsement of our policies by the world&apos;s oTficialmonetary authority and by representativesJthe world&apos;sstrongest economies will relieve the pressures on sterling which have damaged our economic prospectsin the last 12 months while the prospectivearrangement for the sterling balances will help to relieve the risk of such pressures in future years.That alone should do much to restore the confidenceon which all aspects of/economic performancecritically depend.^j^The Government are releasingtoday the first economic forecast published under theour/provisionsSECRET
provisions of the Industry Act 1975s and thiseconomicwill give the House a picture of the/prospectsfollowing the measures I have announced.      Over the next 12 months I expect a growth of total output of about 2%^ more or less ^depending primarily on our export performance.I do not see a prospect of a fall in unemployment;indeed I fear there is likely to be some furtherrise.But if so this will be the consequence, not of todays measures, but of the lower growth now and of the other factors I have already mentionedexpected all over the world1.     The current accountdeficit, which has totalled  1.7billion in thefirst 11 months of this year is likely to fallnext year and there is good hope of reaching a.substantial surplus in 1978/79 - this could amount toJE2-3billion. &apos; &quot;    &apos; &quot;y^Qiveh &quot; &quot; continuing moderation in the increase in wage costs, &apos;  the rateenterof price inflation should    /      once again on toa downward path after the middle of next year, and inthe second half of the year may be running at an annual rate of     16](.*I9.    Next year will be a difficult year of transition.I believe that the policies we are pursuing will ensure that it is a transition to a much more firmly/based
based prosperity.    We owe this opportunity in part tothe development of North Sea oil production, but our economic strength depends also on the use we make of thatitopportunity.    We must use/not only to resume the growth in our living standards but also - and in the long runthis is more important - to rebuild the capital base ofour manufacturing industry.    I believe the late seventiesand early eighties should be a period when a steady increaseof output, employment and living standards is combined withthe repayment of our external debt during the process of recovery.   We shall at last be standing on our own feet,with an economy more healthy and efficient than we have seen at any time since the war.50.    It is in that belief that the Government have decidedthese measures, and that I commend them to the House.
