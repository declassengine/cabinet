DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC 1/IAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(69) 10928th July, 1969CABINETPAY OF GRADES REPRESENTED 3Y THE POST office engineering union memorandum by the Postmaster GeneralThe Post Office is faced with a claim by the Post office engineering Union (POEU) for a 10 per cent increase effective from 1st July, 1969, in the pay of its members employed in the engineering,motor transport, supplies, factories and cableship divisions of the PostOffice,2,      This claim is based in part on wage movements in outsideindustry and in part on productivity savings.    The union are alsoclaiming an improvement of the pay of its women members in relationto that of men, a revision of incremental scales and improved annualleave for two grades.3.      The total number of staff involved is about 109, 000.    If theclaims were met in full, wages would rise by about  19- 20 million a year,4,      The Post Office has negotiated three settlements with the union,in recent years.    An increase of 5 per cent from 1st January, 1966,increases averaging 10^ per cent from 1st July, 1967, following a pay research survey, and 6 per cent from 1st July, 1968.    Linked withthese settlements were agreements involving changes in workingpractices and procedures and other measures designed to improveproductivity which have led to savings over the period covered bythe settlements equivalent to over 23, 000 men.5,      Of the 6 per cent increase which the POEU received last year-,3 per cent was judged to be for outside wage movements (the same asthe Central Pay Increase for that year) and 3 per cent represented40 per cent of the net savings to be achieved from productivitymeasures agreed with the union.    Treatment of the current claim on a similar basis this year would have justified a further increaseof 6 per cent from 1st July, 1969. and I sought the agreement of mycolleagues to offer the union this amount last May,COPY NO.      66
6.      In proposing this response to the claim I recognised thedifficulties of reconciling with the incomes policy a combination of comparability and productivity elements in a single offer.    Butthe element included for comparability v/as no more than the 3^ percent central pay increase awarded to many other civil servants from 1st July, 1969, and only about half of the movement in the Departmentof Employment and Productivity (DEP) Wages Index for all manual workers during I960; and I proposed to limit the element for productivityto a 40 per cent share of the net savings, as in the previous year.    Thiswould I believe have minimised the danger of double counting and at thesame time have maintained a clear financial incentive to the staff to achieve further productivity savings,7,      My colleagues, however, found an offer of 6 per cent on this basis irreconcilable with incomes policy and after an abortive proposalto the union that the case should be referred to the National Board for prices and Incomes (NBPI), I was authorised to offer, without prejudice,a maximum.of 5 per cent based solely on productivity.    The offer1 v/as onthe understanding that the union would co-operate in achieving a reductionin overtime of one hour per man per week as a part of the means ofsecuring the savings envisaged.    The offer v/as equivalent to almost the whole of the net productivity savings foreseeable in the current financial year,8,      I made an offer within the terms of the authority given to mejust before the union&apos;s annual conference in the third week of June,The conference completely rejected it, even as a basis for discussion,and pending a settlement on the basis of a 10 per cent increase and stepsto be taken to end alleged discrimination in the pay of women, resolved to discontinue productivity co-operation and to support the union&apos; executive in further measures to prosecute this claim,    A striketook place on 14th July and secured virtually 100 per cent support.There is no doubt that our refusal to concede a combination of comparability and productivity elements, as v/e had done before,is a dominant factor in the unionrs reaction,9,      Both I and my officials have held several meetings with theunion since their conference and at the First Secretary&apos;s suggestionrepresentatives of the DEP have been associated with these.    Withthe agreement of my colleagues I offered to increase pay by 7 percent and to drop the specific provision about a reduction in overtimeif in return the union would enter into a three-year productivityagreement with us along the broad lines suggested by the DEP(see Annex),    The union told me however that this proposal did not provide a basis for a settlement.    They objected both to the amountoffered and to the idea of a three-year productivity agreement.    Ina further endeavour to resolve the dispute I was authorised to go upto 82 per cent without a long-term pay agreement so long as there wasa clear understanding with the union about co-operation on productivity.
10.      At the most recent meeting with the union, on 17th July, theytold us that the continuance of productivity bargaining and unionco-operation in productivity improvement is entirely dependentupon Post Office acceptance of the following propositions.(i)  Take positive steps to reduce discrimination in certainwomen*s pay scales,(ii) Review arrangements for implementing productivity claims,(iii) Agree to a general pay increase of 10 per cent from 1st July, 1969.Cn-(iv) Make an agreement (taking account of productivity and of recentagreements on Treasury technical classes and certain other civil Service grades) providing for phased increases totalling about 30 per cent over a short period - the first instalment tobe 8-10 per cent on 1st July, 1969.At the same time, emphasising the gravity of the situation, the unionindicated that the 14th July strike was only a beginnings   The executive had had great difficulty in persuading members to strike for only one day.    Branch committees were being asked to make plans for selectivestrikes at short notice and to be prepared for a levy to provide a fund to compensate strikers.11.       I think it should be possible to work out concessions on (i) aboveacceptable both to ourselves and to the union.    Nor is there any real difficulty about (ii).    However, in face of the hardening of the union&apos;position on the main part of their claim, I suggested to my colleagues that it might help a solution if I were given some further flexibility inmy negotiating position before acting on my authority to go to 8f percent.    It had been understood - indeed formally recognised in thedraft heads of the long-term agreement which I put to the union -that the grades concerned would have a comprehensive pay review in 1970 with an operative date of 1st January.    I have little doubt thatthe review will lead to a further increase in pay for POEU grades and,as a means of easing the unions position, I suggested I might offer upto 8^ per cent from 1st July and the balance of 10 per cent from 1st January, 1970, pending the outcome of the pay review.    Mycolleagues have, however, feltunabile   to accept this suggestion.12,      The following possible courses are open to us and I also setout the likely consequences in each case.(a)    To maintain the offer of 7 per cent as from 1st July, 1969.Consequences; Further strikes by the union with effects asset out in my paper C(69) 110.
(b) To offer 7 per cent from 1st July, 1969* with a further 3 per centon 1st January, 1970.Consequences: A less than even chance of being accepted by theunion. If this offer is rejected the strike action which ensues would beless widely supported but still serious in its effects.(c) To offer 8f per cent from 1st July, 1969 (as approved byPI(69) 16th Meeting).Consequences:   The union is more likely to accept this offerbut acceptance cannot be guaranteed as the union annual conference^ound1 the negotiators to obtain 10 per cent as from 1st July, 1969.(d) To offer 10 per cent.Consequences: Acceptance by the union and continuance of productivity measures but serious repercussive effects on attitudesof other Post Office grades (particularly Union of Post Office &quot;Workers)and the rest of the Civil Service leading to expensive wage claims,(e) To drop productivity bargaining altogether, offer an increasebased on comparability only and allow this offer, almost certain to be rejected initially by the union-, to go to Civil Service arbitration.Consequences: Severe loss of efficiency in the Post Officefollowed by revision of tariffs and/or financial objectives,(f) To call in an independent arbitrator on the union&apos;s 10 per centcomparability plus productivity claim associated with an agreement to make the pay research comparability study as soon as possible -this year rather than in 1970,Consequences:   The union would not accept reference to the nbpi but might accept a mutually approved arbitrator.    Strike action would be averted but the eventual cost in wage movement is unknown,J. T.S.General Post Office, E. C. 1,28th July, 1969
