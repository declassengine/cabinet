NOTES77JThe reduction in the Defence Budget is subject to confirma-tion by the Secretary of State for Defence of the practi-ability of achieving a small part of the reduction.(Id)    5 million of the  12 million reduction for England relates to local authority current expenditure on roads which isnot subject to direct central Government control.     Whiletherefore it may not bepossible to ensure that this reduction is secured, it is included in the total reductionfor roads, as agreed, on the understanding that every possible pressure will be applied to persuade localauthorities to make it.(c) The Secretary of State for Scotland has authority to change,in agreement with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, thedistribution between these various programmes of thetotal reductions agreed for Scotland.(d) The Secretary of State for Wales has authority to change,in agreement with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, thedistribution between these various programmes of thetotal reductions agreed for Wales.(e) Within the total reductions of  23.6 million net in health and welfare expenditure,   10.5 million isattributed to charges for hospital treatment in all caraccident cases;    this is open to further consideration if desired.(f) A saving of about  0.5 million would be secured if school mealcharges were raised to 2s. and a saving of about  0.3 millionif a school transport charge were introduced.(g) The range shown is due to the decision that savings in the investment programmes for 1970-71 of the air corporations and the British Airports Authority shouldbe between  2.55 million and  3.3 million,(h) The Cabinet have invited the Minister of Power, withother Ministers concerned, to consider whether this reduction might be made without deferring the start of a power station in 1970.
