C(69) 10328th July, 1969BR PAD CASTINGMemorandum by the Lord President of the council the purpose of this memorandum is to report to my colleagues on the discussions which have taken place     the Ministerial Committeeon Broadcasting and the conclusions which v/e have reached.    the papers considered by the Committee have been circulated to the Cabinetunder cover of C(69) 101,2,      The matters which we have considered are -(i) The future of the national radio services.(ii) Local sound radio,(iii) Hours of television broadcasting,(iv) Finance,The point on which a decision is most urgently required is (ii); if real progress is to be made in building up a local sound radio service beforethe Election, every month is vital.    But the issues are all inter-relatedand must to some extent be considered together; the problem of financedominates the whole field.    We have not merely to decide what v/e wantbut also to show how it is to be paid for,3,      The BBCs plan &quot;Broadcasting in the Seventies&quot; was published on 10th July and debated in the House of Commons last Tuesday,    Wehave taken the Corporation^ proposals as the starting point for our consideration of (i) and (ii) above,(i)   National radio services4,      The main features of the BBCs plan are -(a)    Programme networks would specialise in different types of programme, with Radio 1 concentrating on pop music, Radio 2 on lightmusic and Radio 3 on serious music with some drama of minority appeal,while Radio 4 would become a wholly speech programme.    The newCOPY NO.CABINETDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)
pattern could only be introduced gradually and might involve restrictingRadio 3 to VHF and transmitting Radio 4 on medium wave only during theday while educational programmes were being broadcast on VHF.(b) The three present English regions would be replaced by eightsmaller new-style regions, producing daily news features and weeklygeneral programmes,(c) The Corporation propose to discontinue the Scottish SymphonyOrchestra, the Northern Dance Orchestra, the London Studio Playersand the Training Orchestra and say that they cannot fully support theConcert Orchestra, the Welsh Orchestra and the Northern IrelandOrchestra, the future of which is being discussed with the ArtsCouncils.    There would also be economies in other programmesexpensive to produce,5.      The BBC put forward their plan as designed primarily to meet a changing v/orld with changing tastes and needs.    But they also face the problem of living within an income which, is not rising as fast ascosts.    They estimate that by 1974 national sound radio will be running at an annual loss of  4-1 million, with a cumulative deficit of 12 million without taking account of local radio.    They expectproductivity improvements to yield over  5 million in the fouryears to 1974 and the rearrangement of networks and regionalchanges, about  1 million.    But of the remaining savings! thegreat part -  5 million - would come from disbandment of theorchestras.6,      The Postmaster General has no formal control over theprogramme structure of the BBC and the Ministerial Committeehave reached no conclusion on this aspect of the proposals.     Butthere was general agreement that a reduction in the number oforchestras was undesirable.    This however leaves the problemof where to find the  5 million which the BBC expected this cutto produce.    The Postmaster Generalls memorandum (C(69) 99)shows that there is no prospect of further major administrative economies and to find the money from programme cats elsewheremight be even more damaging,(ii)   Local sound radio7,      The BBC propose to provide a local radio service with 40stations in England (covering 90 per cent of the population), 20 ofwhich would be in service by late 1970; Scotland, Wales and NorthernIreland would receive a lower priority.    They would operate on VHF,with some medium wave back-up.    Each station would have associatedwith it a local broadcasting council to guide and assist the stationmanager.    The running cost of the service when in full operation would be over  5 million a year, which the BBC are in no positionto find,
8.       The basis of the proposals is, of course, the limited experimentannounced in paragraphs 32-42 of the White Paper on Broadcastingpublished in December, 1966 (Cmnd, 3169).    The BBC have made an assessment of the experiment, based on extensive enquiries intothe impact of local broadcasting, including sample surveys by interview with about a thousand persons in each of the eight areas covered.    Theyconclude that the stations are attracting a substantial local audienceand enriching local life and regard the experiment as an undoubtedsuccess.    The Postmaster General has made his own evaluation and reached similar conclusions.    The Ministerial Committee generally are of opinion that the evidence available suggests that the experimenthas been a success and that there is a strong case for giving it permanentform.    In particular it was felt that local radio could make an important contribution to revitalising local democracy,9,      If it is accepted that there should be a permanent sound radioservice, on what basis should it be provided?    If one rejects the concept of commercial companies financed by advertising, there seems no alternative to a national corporation of some sort, sinceexisting local authorities could not be used as a basis for local radioauthorities.    It would be possible to set up a new national corporation to function alongside the BBC, but the balance of advantage is againstdoing so; it would involve difficult legislation and would be likely to prove more expensive, since the BBCs technical and editorial expertiseand resources of recorded material would not be available to it.    the experiment has shown that the appointment of local broadcasting councilsis effective in maintaining the local character of the stations.10.      The Ministerial Committee therefore endorsed the PostmasterGeneraPs proposal to approve the BBCs scheme, subject to three ofthe 40 stations being located in Scotland and three in Wales.    they also agreed that he should appoint the members of local broadcasting councils, though they thought that he would be unwise to restricthimself (as he proposed) to names put forward by the BBC after consulting specified local government bodies and local interests,given the degree of nationalist penetration of the Scottish and Welshregions of the 3BC.    But some members of the Committee expressed doubts as to whether this was the best way of spending  5 million a year,assuming such a sum to be available; an alternative might be to improve the coverage of BBC 2.(iii)   Hours of television broadcasting11.       The question is whether the Government should relax or removepresent restrictions on the hours of television broadcasting.    At presentBBC 1 and stations of the ITA are limited to 53^ hours a week and 8-g- hours a day - for BBC 2 the weekly limit is 32 hours - but certain types ofbroadcast do not count against the limits.    These include religiousprogrammes, Ministerial and Party political broadcasts, outsidebroadcasts (within limits), school broadcasts and repeats thereof,some adult education broadcasts and broadcasts in Welsh.    In effectthese form a protected group.
12.      In the 1966 White Paper we said (paragraph 47) -&quot;In the Governments view, the amount of broadcasting time willremain a matter of sufficient social importance to require thatthe Postmaster General should continue to hold and exercise his present powers of control.    Nor do the Government consider thatany general increase in broadcasting hours will be justified forthe present.    They do not, however, rule out the possibility ofmore time for educational programmes&quot;.Nevertheless a majority of the Committee agrees with the PostmasterGeneral that some relaxation of present restrictions is desirable;  thiswould enable programmes, including repeats of peak hour programmes,to be transmitted for the benefit of those at home during the daytime(who are estimated to number more than 30 per cent of the adultpopulation, including housewives, shift-worker s and the retired).The Postmaster General would prefer to abolish the restrictions-altogether, as being outmoded and inconsistent with the general principle that the broadcasting authorities are responsible for theday-to-day conduct of their affairs.    The majority of the Committee,however, thought that there should be a ban on transmission from say12. 30 a. m. to 9. 15 a. m., though an exception might be made for newstransmissions, and an annual maximum of 4,732 hours.130 The cost to the BBC of this limited extension of hours is put bythe Postmaster General at about  1 million per annum, though a greatdeal must depend on the use made of the increased time available.(iy)   Finance14.       This is the element common to all the proposals and the headunder which we can best assess our priorities,15,      The BBC has an income at present of around  95 million a year^,There are about Z\ million holders of sound radio licences paying 25s, Od.a year and about 15-1 million holders of combined television and radiolicences paying  6 a year (of whom 105,000 pay an extra  5 for colour television).    The BBC receives the product of the licences less the costof collection and certain other services.    An increase of 5s, Od, in the combined licence fee v/ould produce almost  4 million a year and anincrease of 10s, Od. twice that.16.      It will be seen that the sound radio licence is unimportant asa source of revenue.    It is proportionately very expensive to collectand evasion is impossible to combat effectively; transistor sets are almost undetectable and it is estimated that two-thirds of car radiosare not licensed.CO N FIDE NTS AL
17.      As I have already mentioned, the BBC estimate that by 1974 soundradio, even without local radio, will be running an annual deficit of 4f- million, with an accumulated deficit of nearly  12 million; thisgap they propose to close in the main by productivity improvements and by economies on orchestras.    If we wish to save the orchestrasv/e have to indicate an alternative source of income.    And if we want to go ahead with local sound broadcasting on the lines proposed v/e haveto find about  151&quot; million for the four years to 1974, to v/hich must beadded about  4 million for a limited extension of television hours.18.      In theory no doubt we could seek to pay for local radio by a locallicence fee, but this would have to be limited to those within effectivereception radius and would be a nightmare to collect.    A mandatoryrate contribution seems out of the question while the present localauthority structure lasts and voluntary contributions have provedof little value.    Effectively the choice here, as in the case of theBBCls finances generally, lies between accepting advertising insome form and increasing the licence fee.    If we dismiss both these courses we must either hat the orchestras go and do withouta BBC system of local sound radio, or find compensating economieselsewhere, which I would judge an impossible task.19.      In this situation the majority of the Ministerial Committee agreewith the Postmaster General that the best course would be to increasethe combined licence by 10s, Od. from the beginning of next year (i. e.to  6 10s, &amp;d,),    At the same time, the sound radio licence would be abolished, thus saving about  if million in administration costs andrelieving the poorest section of the population, and an intensifiedcampaign would be launched against evasion among owners of televisionsets.   This would provide the BBC with sufficient extra resources tomake it unnecessary for them to disband the orchestras,20.      One or two members of the Ministerial Committee think that before deciding to increase the licence fee v/e should give more thought to possibility of accepting advertisements, at least on BBC 1.    But mostof us think that this would be fatal to the concept of broadcasting as apublic service.Conclusions21,      The points on v/hich an early decision is needed concern the bbc^ proposals for a local sound radio service and the means of financing it,    I invite my colleagues to endorse the recommendationsof the Committee that -(i) There should be a local sound radio service provided by the bbc on the lines discussed in paragraphs 7-10.(ii) That the sound radio licence be abolished and the combinedlicence fee be increased by 10s, Od, a year to pay for this, reprievethe orchestras and provide for a limited increase in the hours of television transmission.
22,      If this is agreed, I recommend that the Postmaster General beauthorised to inform the BBC in confidence of our decision on these two points in advance of any public announcement, so that the planning of thelocal radio service may go ahead.    Given the line taken in the supplydebate the announcement should be left until later in the summer, ifnot until Parliament reassembles.t.f.:Privy Council Office, S. W.1,28th July, 1969
