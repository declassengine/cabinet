The Home Secretary noted two measures already taken as being of particular importance in the restoration of confidence: the establish-ment in pursuance of Resolutions by the Northern Ireland Parliament ofa tribunal of inquiry under the chairmanship of Mr0 Justice Scarman to enquire into the recent grave disordersj and by the Northern ireland government of an Advisory Board, under the chairmanship of --Lord Hunt,to examine the recruitment, organisation, structure and composition ofthe Royal Ulster Constabulary and Ulster Special Constabulary and theirrespective functions;  and to recommend, as necessary, what changes are required to provide for the efficient enforcement of lav/ and orderin Northern Ireland,    The necessity for an early report was emphasised on both sides,4,       The Northern Ireland Ministers reported to the HomeSecretary on the progress being made with the reforms already announced,,    They informed him that in addition to legislation alreadypassed to establish a Parliamentary Commissioner in Northern Ireland,they intend to introduce legislation to establish machinery for the investigation of citizens&apos; grievances against local authorities or other public authorities.

They explained thatthe points scheme for the allocation of local authority houses was nowin operation in all local authority areas pending consideration by theMinister of Development of the comments of particular authorities onthe application of such schemes in their areas.    Thereafter the minister would approve permanent schemes only if they were based on thisprincipleAttention was drawn to the Northern Ireland GovernmentsWhite Paper on Reshaping of Local Government Reform published in July which embodied firm proposals for the designation by anindependent body of the electoral divisions within the new localgovernment areas.

The Home Secretary also noted the Northern Ireland Government^decision to introduce legislation to set up a Community Relations Board topromote good relations between all sections of the community,,    Half themembers of the Board would be Protestant and half Roman Catholic.5.

The Northern Ireland Ministers informed the Home secretary that apart from four persons who were being charged with criminal offences all detainees had been released.The Home Secretary informed the Northern Ireland Cabinetthat the United Kingdom Government had agreed to make a grant of 250,000 in order to relieve the present distress in Northern Ireland,It will be used:-(a) To relieve the immediate distress of individuals by providingclothing, food, medical care and essential furniture (e, gabeds, bedding and cooking utensils).(b) To spread the money as far as possible to satisfy the most urgent needs.(c) To provide a small cash grant where provision in kind is not appropriate.The grant will take the form of a contribution to the UlsterInnocent Victims Appeal Fund.7.      In their discussions Ministers had very much in mind theaffirmation in paragraph 6 of the joint Declaration made at downing street on 19th August,, of the entitlement of every citizen of NorthernIreland to the same equality of treatment and freedom from discrimina-tion as obtains in the rest of the United Kingdom, irrespective ofpolitical views or religion^80      It has been agreed that effective action in the following fieldsis fundamental to the creation of confidences&quot;(i) Equality of opportunity for all in public employment, without regard to religious or political considerationsc(ii) Protection against the incitement of hatred against any citizenon the grounds of religious belief0

The Government of Northern Ireland have accordingly sought theco-operation of the Home Secretary in setting up joint working parties of officials of the two Governments to examine the extent to which theGovernment of Northern Ireland&apos;s present practice or pledged commit-ments adequately ensure(i) the fair allocation of houses by public authorities;(ii) the avoidance of any discrimination in any form of publicemployment;  and(iii) the promotion of good community relations by methods includingthe prohibition of incitement to religious hatredand to report to the Government of Northern Ireland within a matter of weeks.10.
