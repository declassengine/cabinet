DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT)LOCAL GOVERNMENT REORGANISATION IN WALES -IMPLICATIONS FOR ENGLANDMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local government it is necessary for the Cabinet to consider the implications for england of local government reorganisation in Wales.20      An announcement in The Gueen*s Speech that the government intended to introduce a Bill to reorganise local government in Waleson the lines of the 1967 White Paper would come in the middle of discussions with the associations about reorganisation in England,,It would help those critics of the Commission^ proposals who advocate the retention of two tiers of authority, either in England generally or inthose parts where the demography is similar to that in Wales,    It wouldalso help those who believe that the Commission^ minimum population of around 250,000 for an authority responsible for education and the personal services was pitched too high, and consequently advocate having a larger number of units, either in one tier or in two tiers.    The county boroughsof Swansea and Newport, for instance, have populations 171,000 and112,000, and the county of Powys 116,000 (though geography limits thealternative arrangements so far as Powys is concerned).    Moreoverwe must be concerned about the effect of the proposal to retain county boroughs as such, both in principle and in relation to any publicpronouncement.    The principle of joining town and country is sowidely accepted elsewhere that its non-observance in Wales maybe embarrassing,3,      The announcement might be particularly unfortunate in its effect on the Association of Municipal Corporations,    They are likelyto be the only association favouring the unitary principle in England,and they have opposed the proposals for &quot;Wales since 1967 in favour ofa unitary organisation.    They are not, however, wholly united; but theannouncement about Wales might further weaken their stance,4,      I suggest that The Gueen*s Speech should say merely that studies are being pressed forward on the reorganisation of local government inall three parts of Great Britaino    We should review the matter at the endC(69ft 125COPY NO.3rd October, 1969CABINET
of the discussions about reorganisation in England, with a view to astatement about reorganisation in Wales being made at the same time asthe White Paper is issued,, or perhaps rather later,,5.      This would not be inconsistent with the drafting of a Welsh bill being put in hand but the Secretary of State might even now be Invited to reconsider the proposals for South Wales and to provide either for the bill itself to end the separation of town and country or for the BUI to containmachinery enabling him to do this at some later stage.A.G.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.W.1.2nd October, 1969-2-
