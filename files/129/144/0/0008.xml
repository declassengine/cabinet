C(69) 108 COPY NO,28th July, 1969CABINETNORTHERN Ireland memorandum by foe Secretary of Stats for the Home department the purpose of this memorandum is to take stock, before the recess, of the situation in Northern Ireland.    Following the meeting of theCabinet on 7th May (CC(69) 21st Conclusions, Minute 2) when foe situation was last comprehensively considered, I arranged for regular summariesto be issued of the main political events in Northern Ireland.    The PrimeMinister and I met Major Chichester-Clark and other Northern ireland ministers in London on 21st May and I reported the discussions to theCabinet on 22nd May (CC(69) 24th Conclusions, Minute 2).    the developments in the situation since Major Chichester-Clark took officeour outlined in the Annex.2.      There is serious concern among a number of people in NorthernIreland over what may happen in Londonderry on 12th August, when theApprentice Boys of Londonderry^ hold their annual parade to commemoratethe relief of foe City in 1689.    Mr. John Hume, an Independent Memberof the Northern Ireland House of Commons, has expressed to the Ministerof State at the Home Office the gravest apprehension over the prospects for 12th August.    He spoke of the loss by the Roman Catholic inhabitants of the city of respect for law and order in general and for the Royal ulster constabulary (RUC) and the Spocial Constabulary in particular.    Hisopinion is echoed by Miss Bernadette Devlin, MP, who came to see theMinister of State on the same day.    It is as yet too soon for the NorthernIreland Government to make an authoritative appreciation of what is likelyto happen on 12fo August (or at other Protestant and Civil Rightsdemonstrations expected to follow)! but if Mr. Hume&apos;s fears for12th August are realised, and rioting does break out again in Londonderryand becomes more serious than before, there is a danger that the policewill lose control of the situation, and that the Northern Ireland Governmentwill then have to ask for military assistance to restore order.-1-*The Apprentice Boys are a Protestant Order similar to the Orange Order.They are named after the thirteen apprentice boys who locked foe gatesof Londonderry against the Earl of Antrim in 1688 and so begaa thesiege.    Several thousand members of the Order gather for the paradeevery year.j^jg DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYtS GOVERNMENT)
3,      On the other hand,*lespite the setbacks on 12th&quot;15th July, there are some signs which are encouraging.    The issues are no longer generallyseen as the legitimate political grievances of a minority against anunheeding, repressive government.    The Northern Ireland Government isnow for the first time firmly committed to the removal of the maingrievances and is taking steps to do so.    This fact is recognised byopinion on all sides, and leaders of all groups are showing an increasingreadiness to join together in preventing the kind of violence whichLondonderry and other towns have just experienced.    Whether the more extreme factions will also co-operate remains to be seen, and neither thePeopleTs Democracy nor Mr. Paisley have so far committed&quot; themselves.Both have shown signs of militancy during recent weeksa bul there aregrounds for hope that, if they do resort to organised violence in thepresent climate, they will become increasingly isolated and that theordinary forces of law and order will more easily be able to contain them.It is possible therefore that the danger of organised violence on a large scale has to some extent receded, and that the greatest risk at the presenttime is of further outbreaks of hooliganism, which will be widely accepted as such.    It is to be hoped that the police will be able to control suchoutbreaks, but the danger that they will not, and that the NorthernIreland Government will have to ask for military assistance, must notbe underestimated.4.      A Parliamentary Motion put down by Mr. Paul Rose and a numberof other Members on the Government side calls among other things for&quot;Home Office&quot; observers in Northern Ireland, and for the withdrawal ofthe Ulster Special Constabulary from Londonderry and its environs.These suggestions derive from discussions between Mr. Hume andMr. Rose and his colleagues following Mr. Humefs visit to the Minister ofState at the Home Office on 22nd July, when he made a number of proposalsdesigned to reduce the temperature in Londonderry.    Among other things,he thought that a visit to the City by the Prime Minister or myself before12th August would have a calming effect.    He suggested that United Nationsobservers might be stationed in Londonderry or, alternatively, that asmall contingent of Metropolitan Police might be sent as observers toadvise the RUC in methods of crowd control.    Miss Devlin suggested tothe Minister of State that English police officers should be brought over totake charge of the RUC and that the Ulster Special Constabulary shouldbe disbanded, a suggestion made also by Mr. Hume.    For the reasons give when the Cabinet discussed these matters on 7th May I do not recommend these courses.Matters for decision5,      Replacement of the 1st Battalion, the Prince of Wales*s Own.    Inaddition to the service units normally stationed in Northern Ireland, the1st Battalion, the Prince of Wales*s Own was sent to the province in april to assist in guarding vulnerable points against sabotage.    The military were originally responsible for guarding about 40 such points.    The number hasnow been reduced to five, and these will be handed over to the civil authorities on 2nd August.    I understand that the extra battalion must be withdrawn in August and the question arises whether it should be replaced.This question is dealt with in a separate memorandum by the Minister ofDefence for Administration.       -
Use of helicopters by the RUC6,      The Northern Ireland Government has raised informally with theHome Office the possibility of using the Ministry of Defence flight ofWessex helicopters at present stationed in Northern Ireland for theemergency transport of members of the RUC in conditions where the rapid movement of, say, 30 men to a trouble spot is essential in theinterests of keeping the peace.    It has also been suggested thathelicopters could be used to observe and report on crowd movements tothe police.    These suggestions are also dealt with in the paper by theMinister of Defence for Administration.7.      I invite my colleagues to agrees(a) that the present is not the right moment for the Prime minister or me to visiii Northern Ireland, and that Home Office or otherobservers should not be sent to Northern Ireland;(b) that the Prime Minister, the Defence Secretary and I should have authority to decide any questions on which urgent decisions arerequired when it is not practicable to call a meeting of Ministers.L. J. C0Home Office, 5.17.1.28th July, 1969
annexReview of the Situation in Northern Ireland sinceMajor Chichester-Clarlc took  office .After Major Chichester-Clark took  office there were no furtherriots in Northern Ireland until 1 2th July, and in many ways thesituation seemed promising.     Fears that any successor toCaptain 0&apos;Neill would lead a repressive administration were not realised and the new Government has continued Captain 0&apos;Neill&apos;programme of reform.     The model scheme for the allocation oflocal authority houses has been completed and was sent to localauthorities on 1 2th June.     Housing authorities have been askedto adopt the scheme, or a satisfactory modification of it, as soonas possible and to report to the Northern Ireland Government whatthey have done.     The Act to establish a Parliamentary Commissionerfor Administration has been passed and Sir Edmund Compton took up his duties on 1st July,     The White Paper on the reorganisation oflocal government was published on 2nd July, although originally itwas not expected until the Autumn.     Bills to provide foruniversal adult suffrage in local authority elections, to establish an independent commission on wards and electoral divisions withinthe new local authorities, and to provide new machinery for investigating complaints against local authorities, are all being prepared and are due to be introduced in the Northern ireland parliament before the end of the year.      There is no reason to doubt this timetable.     Northern Ireland Ministers have repeated the pledge to review the Special Powers Acts as soon as circumstances permit.2.    In general the Ulster Unionist Party appears to be uniteubehind Major Chichester-Clark and its divisions, if not healed, are for the most part covered.     The proposed scheme for allocatinglocal authority houses had a favourable reception, and the morecontroversial proposals for the reorganisation of local governmentwere accepted in the Parliamentary party by 30 voten to eight.Mr. Faulkner has given Major Chichester-Clark his full co-operation.The former Minister of Home Affairs, Mr. Crajg, has attacked boththe White Paper on the reorganisation of local government and theadministration as a whole, but there is so far no evidence that hehas any wide-spread support.3.    Opposition Members at Stormont have continued their attacks on the Public Order Bill (which was passed by the House of commons on 3rd July) but have accepted, with some qualifications, that theGovernment1 s timetable for reform is reasonable.     They have givencautious support to the scheme for allocating local authorityhouses, but so far little comment on the reorganisation of localgovernment.
U,    The Civil Rights Association decided in May that it wouldsuspend its programme of demonstrations for six weeks in order toallow Major Chich.ester-Clark, s administration time to proveitself.     Demonstrations were resumed on 28th June on the grounds that the Government had not promised a satisfactory timetable for reform (the agreement of Opposition Members that the timetablewas reasonable has been attacked by the more extreme members ofthe Association);   since they coincided with the preparations ofthe Orange Order for its celebration on 1 2th July the royal ulster Constabulary foresaw a difficult period between 28th june and 12th July, but that period passed without serious incident,too civil rights rallies in Strabane and Newry were entirelypeaceful;   a march in Armagh led to scuffles but no seriousviolence.     A number of Orange processions were, more or lessunmolested.     There were high hopes that serious violence wouldhe avoided on 1 2th July itself.5.    It is disappointing that the progress and comparative harmonyof the previous weeks should   have been set back by the   outbreaks of violence on 1 2th-1 5th July.     The main centres of violencewere Londonderry and Dungiven, but incidents also took place in belfast, Lurgan and Limavady,     The riots appear to have been largely acts of hooliganism and to have arisen spontaneously asa result of the tensions caused by the Orango processions on12th July,     There is little or no evidence that they were deliberatelyorganised or stimulated.     In some places they followed the traditional pattern, with Nationalist and Unionist mobs facingeach other and being kept apart by the police.     In all,154 policemen were injured, 116 of them in Londonderry;5k civilians were injured, 46 of them in Londonderry;   and therewill be 30 prosecutions, 53 of them in Londonderry.     in londonderry the c ost of the damage is estimated to have beengreater than the c ost of damage caused in all the previousdemonstrations since the present campaign started in October 1968.To what extent it will have an effect on the tourist trade andon industrial investment in Northern Ireland cannot be measured.
6.    A march from Newtowributler to Enniskillen was organised bythe People&apos;s Democracy for Saturday, 26th July, but was bannedby the Northern Ireland Government,   Meetings were staged inprotest against the ban and 52 arrests were made.   There was evidence of public hostility and some scuffles took place, butthere was no serious violence,7,    The recent violence in Londonderry was unequivocallydenounced by priests of the Roman Catholic Church and by theDeny Citizens&apos; Action Committee (the leading civil rightsorganisation in Londonderry), and civil rights workers played a valuable part in restraining the opposing crowds.   There is growing recognition in Northern Ireland that the ultimate causeis the chronic unemployment and poor housing in Londonderry, andthe bitterness and frustration to which they lead.   Traditionalsectarian and political differences are recognised as relevant,but mainly as providing a natural and almost instinctive outlet for feeling.   The situation is particularly disturbing because nocomplete or permanent solution is likely to be found untilunemployment has been relieved and housing improved:    this willtake a number of years, and further violence must be expected tobreak out periodically in the meantime.   I referred to these aspects of the Northern Ireland Governments policies when reported on the talks with the Prime Minister of Northern Irelandand his colleagues on 22nd May (CC(69/20th Conclusions item)2).I am having prepared a detailed study of the economic and housing policies, which will be circulated in the HONIP Scries,-3-
