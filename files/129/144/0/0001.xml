(THIS DOCUMENTJE.SJIHE-raOPERTY-OFJgSRJBRITANNIC^MAJE^TY^S^G^YE^MENT)1.     This paper summarises the main issues for sonsideration bythe Committee.    The arguments on each issue are developed at greater length in separate papers.Local Radio2.     The White Paper on Broadcasting (Cmnd. 3169 of December 1966)authorised the BBC to undertake an experimental service of local radio,.    Sight stations (Leicester, Sheffield, Merseyside,Nottingham, Brighton, Stoke-on-Trent, Leeds and Durham) were opened   accordingly between November 1967 to July 1968.3.     The experiment was to be reviewed, &quot;after a year or so of operation&quot; and the Government reserved &quot;until the conclusion ofthe experiment any decision on the question whether a general and permanent service should be authorised,and, if so, how it shouldbe constituted, organised and by whom provided, as well as how itshould be financed&quot;.k*     A decision on these questions is becoming urgent because:-(a) the time set for the experiment is now running out;(b) the BBC staffs- concerned are naturally anxious about their future;(c) the future of local radio is closely related (bothfinancially and structurally) to the plans which the BBChave submitted to me for&apos;reshaping their national radioservices (see paragraph 6 below);(d) the opposition having announced that their policy willbe to authorise commercial local radio, our own policy nowneeds to be announced and brought into effect as rapidly aspossible.B(69)220th June, 3.969.COPY NO,cabinet ministerial COMMITTEE ON BROADCASTINGSUMMARY OF MAIN ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATIONMemorandum by the Postmaster General- 1 -
.5o     I have accordingly canvassed a wide range of opinion on thelocal radio experiment: from the BBC, from the local broadcasting councils, from national and local organisations of all kinds, andfrom the general public.    The results are outlined in Paper B(69)k*National Radio60     Lord Hill and his colleagues on the Board of BBC Governorshave put to me their plans for the future structure of thenational radio services.    The two purposes behind their plans are: to rationalise and modernise the service to take account ofchanged listening habits; and to effect economies because the bbc is living beyond its means.7.     Each of the four national services would specialise on atype of programme; Radio 1 - much as now - on pop and news;Radio 2 on light music and news; Radio 3 - transmitted on VHPonly - on classical music and minority drama; while Radio k wouldin time become wholly a speech programmee   This classificationis developed and its implications considered in B(69)6.   As partof the cbange to Radio k,  &quot;opt-out&quot; programmes in the three english regions (but not in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) would be dropped.   Besides this, another economy, and one likely to cause trouble, is the reduction in the number of BBC orchestras.    Theseeconomies would help to keep national radio out of the red; theywould necessarily enable the BBC to finance, from current licence revenue,a local radio service.Finance8.     Broadly speaking the maintenance of the existing BBC nationalradio services would require an increase of 5s. in the currentlicence fees ( 6 - combined television and radio and 25s. - radioonly) bringing in some  km. p.a. extra revenue.9.     To finance local radio on the basis of say kO stations(covering 88% of the population) would cost, when in full operation after,  say,  two years,  another  km. involving another5s. on the licence fee.10.   These figures are based on various assumptions, e.g.(a) that there is no major scope for further economies inBBC costs.   A thorough review by Mc^inseys is now in itsconcluding stages and, in so far   as sources of economy havebeen revealed, they have already, according to the BBC, beentaken into account;(b) that we must continue to accept a substantial, thoughreducing, loss from licence evasion.    The present loss (oncombined television and radio licence fees) is estimated ataround  7jbi* P*a.    The BBC are assuming that over the nextfew years we can reduce this by  3im. p.a., (producing some fm. p.a. for sound radio).    I am circulating a separate memorandum on this problem Paper, B(69)5,but I. am bound to sayI think the BBC are being optimistic;- 2 -
(c) that local sources of finance for local radio can make no more than a marginal contribution to its cost.    This,unfortunately, seems to be true.    Seven of the existing eightexperimental Stations receive contributions ranging from 7*500 p.a. to  63*000 p.a. from the local authorities concerned. (and&apos; practically nothing from anyone else),.   but these local authorities though in. favour of continuing these stations on their present basis have urged that the &quot;financial burden&quot; on them &quot;must be very materially reduced&quot; *   and clearly the chance of any further authorities providing money for this purpose against a background of pressure for economy and of the opposition&apos;s advocacy of commercial local radio(which it. is claimed can make a sizeable contribution to local rates) is extremely remote.(d) that the BBC should not accept advertising revenue.The BBC, after some thought, have set their faces firmlyagainst this.   I wholly agree with them.11.   As an alternative to, or in reduction of, the possibleincreases in licence fees discussed above various proposals forsubsidies are known to have been considered by the BBC and some.at least, of these may be further pursued.    They include:(i)   Relief from S.E.T.(ii)    A Government grant for educational broadcasting(iii)   A Government grant equivalent to the estimatedrevenue lost by licence evasion(iv)   An Arts Council grant for BBC orchestrasTelevision12.   Another question on which a decision is expected urgently is whether we should relax, or drop altogether, our present controlover the number of hours of television broadcasting - a control which I personally consider unnecessary and outmoded.   Since the bbc and ITA are given full   independence in organising their services within available resources, it seems unduly restrictivethat Government should prescribe for how long they should be on theair.   An extension of broadcasting hours would be welcome to theIndependent programme companies as affording some relief from the recently announced  3m. p.a. increase in the levy on theiradvertising receipts.    On the other hand it would add to thefinancial pressure on the BBC.    I have commissioned anindependent study into this problem and have gust received theresults.   They will shortly be available for consideration by theCommittee.13.   Also, in the White Paper of December 1966 we recorded our decision that no allocation of frequencies to a fourth television service would be authorised for the next three years at any rate.This period is now running out.   A second service of independent- 3 -
television might, I think, in principle be the best way ofwidening the choice of programme available.     But here too thereis a financial problem - this time for independent television.The ITA&apos;s views, which I have sought on this matter, should beavailable shortly after the end of this month.Ik.   conclusion the Committee is invited to take note of this paper,J.

3..      IntroductionProm the BB0&apos;s point of view, a number of considerations, irioX^dixts financial provisions, negotiation af leases, and most important, staff uncertainty,require that a decision on the long-term future of Local Radio should be reached in the summer of 1969.     The period of station operation covered by this reviewis necessarily brief, especially so in the case of the later stations.     But inthe view of the BBC it is an adequate period on which to base decisions for thefuture.2.      Selection of StationsThe readiness of lacal authorities and other local interests to contributefinancially was obviously an impertant factor in the selection of towns forlacal radio stations.     The BBC decided, sinae speed was vital, to work in thefirst instance through local authorities.     In response to a general invitation,eighty of them were represented at a large conference at Broadcasting House inJanuary 1967 where the scheme was explained by officials of the BBC, the PestOffice, and the Association of Municipal Corporations.     This conferenceprompted enquiries from a large number of towns interested in participating inthe experiment.     Many withdrew, finding the easts toa great, but enough wereprepared to meet them, or a substantial enough part af them., for the experimentto proceed.    Nine towns were selected.     One, Manchester, withdrew after achange of control at the local elections, leaving eight stations which begantransmitting on the dates shown.Leicester 8.II.I967; Sheffield 15.11.1967;Merseyside 22.11.1967; Nattingham 31.I.1968;Brighton I4.2.I9685 Stoke-on-Trent 14.3.1968;Leeds 24.6.I968; Durham 3.7.1968.The White Paper expected that the first stations would become operational withinabout a year.     Considerable work was involved in selecting and training staff,finding suitable premises, adapting them and installing technical equipment;nevertheless, the first three stations became aperational well within the year.3.      finance the Government, in the White Paper, laid it down that so far as possible the experiment should be financed from local sources, and not from the generallicence fee.     Local authorities and ather bodies were mentioned as possiblesaurces of income, although any income by way af direct subvention on the rateswas ruled out.All the capital expenditure involved in the experiment has been Borne by the BBC.The original estimate of  35,000 of capital per station proved to be accurate.A little over 50$ of the local radio operating expenditure for 1968/69 wascontributed locally.     Most of it came from the local authorities.     The figures were:Brighton  25,000 p.a.Durham (County)  10,000 p.a.Leeds  25,000 p.a.Leicester  52,000 p.a.Merseyside  63,000 p.a.Nottingham  32,000 p.a.Sheffield  50,000 p.a.(Rotherham  7,500 p.a.Stokeron-Trent  52,000 p.a.
The Borough of Hove contributed  1,000 to Radio Brighton as a once-only payment.The Leeds figure of  25,000 was less than was originally anticipated, becausethe City Coimo.il considered the transmission range to he less than it had expected.     These grantc apply only to the period of the experiment.     In thecase of the first group of stations, they expire in November 19^9.At Merseyside and Stoke-on-Trent, where the obligation undertaken by the lopalauthorities was &quot;by way of a guarantee, the local authorities have received off-setting contributions from local industry and commerce to a substantial extent.The BBC was not involved in.these arrangements.Apart from these subscriptions from industrial and eommercial interests atMerseyside and Stoke-on-Trent, contributions from local sources other than localauthorities have not been large, although relatively small sums (up to  500)have come from a variety of local sourees including, at one station or another,all the possible contributors mentioned in the White Paper with the exception ofthe Open University.     Some contributors, including, for example, groups ofChurches, have preferred to buy additional equipment for their l*cal station, tothe value of perhaps  200 or  300.Experience has shown that there were unfortunate disincentives in the localsubscription scheme.     In deciding on the level of its contribution, a localauthority already under severe financial pressure was not unaware of the factH that the BBC would underwrite the local station and in the last resort wouldP make good the margin between what the local authority offered and the actualj8 operating cost.     Equally, once a local authority had announced the amount of its guarantee, other local interests tended to regard offsetting contributionsH  from themselves as payments to help relieve the rate-payers of a burden, ratherm  than as positive additional support for the station.nThe BBC found its own local staff fully extended in actually running the stations.It did not itself initiate fund-raising activities.     The Local Radio Councilsdid not prove to be effective fund-raisers.     It was not that they tried andfailed, but rather that they did not see this function clearly as part of theirbrief.In 1966 the BBCs estimate of the cost of running a local station was  52,000 perannum.   For their first twelve months on the air, the local operating costs ofthe three stations which led the experiment were;Leicester  .54,000Sheffield  55,000Merseyside       65,000In addition there were central costs, of which the heaviest item was a substantialsum for audience research.It is clear that the corresponding figures for the second year will be considerably higher.     Some rising costs, e.g. extra S.E.T., could not be foreseen or avoided.Limited additions to staff became necessary, where experience in practice showed the work-load to have boon underestimated.     Other additional charges resulted from the success of local radio.     Audience reaction proved to be on a scale which led to substantial overspending on the provision made for postage and telephone expenditure.     The demand for more local programmes expressed by local radio Councils reinforced by the evidence of every audience research survey, andthe continuing and growing availability of good local material on a scale well beyond expectations, resulted in a level of local output considerably higher than had been foreseen.    An anticipated 4 to 5 hours per day has now grown to anaverage      hours daily, at an all-in average cost of nearly  33 per hour.During the experiment some stations have become a little too ambitious, and have over-extended themselves.     In those cases some cutting back of the presentoutput might well be necessary.     Nevertheless, taking into account the undoubtedneed for some further limited staff strengthening and the likelihood of increasedprogramme expenditure, particularly on fees to professional contributors, it seems certain that on todayrs rates budgets of up to  80,000, and perhaps in the case of stations with large editorial areas up to  100,000, must be expected.
4-       Oono hiiuti.on and Oqnlj-^lPouring the period of the experiment the Local Radio Councils b?we i?c?en feelingtheir way, with .a considerable degree of success.     They have well dischargedtheir primary function of standing sponsor for the station to the community andthey have had a real influence on programmes and on station policy.The BBCs relations with the Councils have been cordial, constructive andfruitful.     Occasionally a member, here or there, has shown signs of wanting tohave more authority.     But, almost universally, the BBCs claim to editorialcontrol has been respected and understood, and the station managers given a free hand.     At some centres Council members have organised themselves intogroups, each taking a special interest in a certain section of the station&apos;output and even going so far as to participate in programme-making under thestation manager&apos;s editorial guidance, and in helping to seek out talent andcontacts.Links with BBC Headquarters have been well maintained.     The Chairmen have met in London every two months at least, to discuss experiences and problems and toput their views and their questions to the central Local Radio DevelopmentManager and to Managing Director, Radio, both of whom have invariably attendedthese meetings.     The Director-General has also been present frequently.The Councils had no say in the choice of staff at the local stations.     Thiswas because in every case the Council was only named a very short time beforethe station opened.     The right of a Council, perhaps through its Chairman,to participate alongside the BBC in the selection of the Station Manager needs to be considered in connection with any permanent local radio arrangement.   Sucha right would do much to meet the wishes of those Council members who would liketo see the Councils enjoying a stronger constitutional position.The independence of the local stations is of a degree hitherto not experiencedwithin the BBC.     After the launching of the stations, the central unit inLondon wa.s reduced to one senior official.     The output of the stations cannotbe heard in London, and there is no formal day-to-day programme supervision.The local character and distinctiveness of the stations is assured first by their freedom to meet the needs of their widely differing communities in their own way,and second by the influence of their Local Radio Councils and of lacal publicopinion generally.     At the same time, the station managers know that thecentral organisation of the BBC is there to support them.     They have shown goodsense in knowing when, and to whom, to refer when they were in need of assistance.5-      ProgrammesPreliminary audience research showed that the local listener&apos;s first requirementwas a good and independent source of local news.     A high proportion of eachstation&apos;s budget is spent in meeting this requirement.     Bulletins at fixed timesthroughout the day are a universal feature, but the informality of its generalpresentation allows a station to interrupt its programmes at any time withflashes of important news.     The radio car, permitting almost instant broadcastsat any time from any location of interest, gives immense flexibility to thiscoverage.Breakfast time, mid-day and high-tea time have been found te be the peaklistening periods, and this is where the main emphasis is placed on providingnews and topical magazine programmes.     Outside these peak hours, regular spacesare provided for programmes of particular interest to women, with local market prices, advice from local consumer groups,and much other local information of value;   to the elderly and housebound;    to the sick;   to youth:    to young children to parents;   to group after group of local people sharing special interests.Extensive coverage is given to matters of local controversy;   many consider thegreatest value of this form of local radio to be the opportunity it provides ofairing local issues thoroughly and with complete impartiality.     Many of these arguments arise on local government matters.     Local government in one form or another is constantly being dealt with in the programmes, hour by hour.     Onestation, Radio Leicester, broadcasts Council debates as they happen.     The otherstations give running reports on Council meetings.
Local M.P.S are frequent contributors to local radio programmes.     Frequentlythey speak direct from Westminster, reporting on Parliamentary activities.     at other times, when they are in their constituencies, they give talks, and take part in discussions, from the local studios.The stations have paid great attention to topics touching on the local economy and local prosperity.     Local industry and commerce have yielded a constantstream of valuable and informative programme material.All the stations are strong on sports coverage, and this is an ingredient whichpulls in very large audiences.     Gramophone record time is in short supply.The copyright owners, because of Union policies, permit only one hour of recordsto each station per day.    Most of these records are used in request programmes which enable listeners to send broadcast greetings to neighbours at times of family celebration, to sick friends in hospital, and so on.Already the local stations have made participation in broadcasting an everydayexperience to thousands of people who never expected to speak on the air in their lives.     Each station has become in a real sense a community forum, availableto citizens who care to call in at the studios, or to face an encounter with the radio car or with a local reporter&apos;s tape-recorder, or even just to telphone in and speak on the air direct from home&apos;,   or to write a letter which can be readat the local microphone.     Radio is making local democracy articulate.Two years ago, many people believed that local broadcasting could never be a sustained operation, and that the supply of local material would rapidly be exhausted.     This theory has been totally exploded.     Practical experience hasshown the local community to be a continually replenished reservoir for theBroadcaster.    The supply of local topics crying out for programme treatment is virtually inexhaustible.     The limiting factor is not the supply of material, but rather of resources to handle it.6.      Local Music and DramaThe inability of local stations to meet the national fee scale required by theMusicians&apos; Union has meant that little employment has been offered to professionalmusicians.     Equity, too, has insisted on national rates with a similar result.The offer to consider a lower rate in this case was unfortunately accompanied byrestrictions which, in the view of the BBC, it would have been impossible to operate.Local amateur music-making, at many levels of music, has however found a readyplace in local programmes.     Much of it has been of a high standard.     The sameis true of amateur entertainment generally.     Already a number of artists whobegan as amateurs in local radio have moved on to professional performance beforelarger audiences.     It seems that the local station could well have a valuabletalent-spotting and launching role in the spectrum of the entertainment mediagenerally, giving promising newcomers some first experience in broadcasting and enabling them to become known.The local stations give great help every day to Music, Drama and the Arts.     Inthe way of preview, descriptive talks, interviews and discussions, localcriticism, and &quot;Whafs On&quot; announcements, they draw attention to local culturalactivities and give them the build-iip they need.     There is encouraging evidenceof the favourable effect of such broadcasts.7.      Educational programmes single educational specialist on the staff of each station has been anexceedingly busy person.     He has worked in close consultation with the educationalsub-committee of the Local Radio Council, and on the average his output has reached four hours a week.     Such productivity has only been possible becauseof generous cooperation by L.E.A.S, Extra-Mural Departments, the W.E.A., andothers, at the programme-making as well as at the advisory level.
Programmes for schools, always devised in consultation with the local ChiefEducation Officer and his staff, have divided into two categories.     Onecategory was that of looal topics, and out of a wide range perhaps the programmesadvising leavers on local career opportunities, including interviews withpersonnel managers and prospective employers, should be singled out for specialmention.     The second category was of programmes on general topics, providedbecause the teaching resources of the community needed special help in these subjects.     There have also been educational projects for groups of children in need of special help - for example Radio Durham has undertaken a specialeducational service designed by the L.E.A., for seventy handicapped childrenunable to leave their homes.     The L.E.A. has supplied the children with VHPreceivers.Further Education programmes have covered an equally extensive field. Many ofthese series have been accompanied by well-produced booklets. Sales of 500 ofsuch booklets are a common-place.At both levels, Schools and Further Education, there is a general feeling atalmost every centre that the exploitation of local radio has hardly started yet.Enough has been done to show great potential.     The Department of Education and science has made a study of the work undertaken so far which gives encouragement to this opinion.8&quot;      Religious BroadcastingEach Local Radio Council has formed a Religious Broadcasting sub-committee, and almost everywhere this has proved to be a most active and effective body.     the churches generally have been quick to see the possibilities of local radio andhave taken the lead in making arrangements to prepare good programmes themselvesan a regular, frequent and continuing basis.     In some centres they pay the costs of live broadcasts from places of wot ship on Sundays and included in therota by general local consent are religious groups (e.g. the Jews) who do not normally participate in the &quot;main stream&quot; broadcasts on the networks.9 *      Listening FiguresThe BBCs Audience Research Department has conducted extensive and costlyenquiries into the impact of local broadcasting, culminating in sample surveysby interview with approximately a thousand persons in each of the eight areasafter one year&apos;s operation.These have concerned the availability of VHF  receivers, the extent of listeningto the local station and public opinion about the role and achievements of local radio.     The Post Office has been fully informed about the methods used and will,ef course, receive the final report - about all eight stations - when it is complete in mid-summer.Interim studies in Leicester, Sheffield, Meiseyside and Nottingham indicated that these areas together contained about one million adults who had VHF  setsand/or radio relay, that about 800,000 had heard &quot;Choir local radio of whom over half-a-million were listening to it at least one or two days a week.     Some 80per cent of those who had listened thought their local radio had already made&quot;a very good start&quot; and was something the local people could be proud of.The findings after a foil year&apos;s operations are now becoming available.     to judge by the interim studies, those for the first (Leicester) are likely to beparalleled by the resl-.     These show there to have been a growth in the incidence of VtIF and/or radio relay from 40 to 44$ over the year.     About a thirdof the population were currently local radio listeners, most of them at leastane or two days a week.     To cite two examples;   the station&apos;s breakfastprogramme &quot;Good Morning Leicester&quot; had recently been heard by 15$ of the totaladult population and its midday &quot;Leicester Scene&quot; by 18$.
Most of the local population regard their station as &quot;interesting&quot;, &quot;entertaining&quot;and &quot;free and ea,sy&quot;, few consider it &quot;dull&quot; or &quot;too serious&quot;.     There is widespread support for the view that it has made a good start, providing a valuable service to the community and constituting a legitimate source of localpride.At the same time substantial majorities reject propositions that the supply ofsuitable local material was inadequate, that local affairs were not importantenough to justify a local radio station or that local radio was superfluouseither because &quot;there were enough radio stations already&quot; er because &quot;we havealready got all the local news and information we needed&quot;.10.     conclusion the style and comprehensive range of service evolved by the eight local stationsduring this experiment has no parallel.     British local radio adds somethingnew and significant to the spectrum af broadcasting.In its evidence to the Pilkington Committee in 19^1, the BBC argued that community-service local radio on these lines was both practicable and desirable in Britain.     The BBC now considers that the experiment just undertaken amplyconfirms that view.     The stations have come fully up to expectations in theirperformance, and in many respects have exceeded it.      In the BBCs view, local radio on these lines has proved itself.     It provides a service of real value to local democracy, and one which gives enrichment to l&amp;cal life.     The BBChopes that it will be empowered to provide a permanent service on these lines,based on satisfactory financial arrangements.NMS14.5.69.
THIS-CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE EROPERTC^^HE^ro^MN^^^nl^^Y^^^B(69)U ..- copy N0&quot;-iii-23rd June, 1969.cabinet ministerial COMMITTEE ON BROADCASTINGLOCAL RADIO;    EVALUATION OF THE EXPERIMENTAL service memorandum by the Postmaster General-1.     In December 1966, we asked the BBC to conduct an experiment in local radio.    Our purpose was to establish, before deciding whether a general and permanent service should be authorised:(i)    that there was sufficient programme material of aspecifically local character to maintain it month-in,month-out;(ii)   whether there was a sufficient continuing demandfor it;(iii)   how far local financial support for the stationscould be relied upon.More generally, we envisaged that &quot;properly organised local radiowould provide a valuable service to the community;  and by giving a new means of expression to its particular interests and aspirations, serve to reinforce its distinctive character andsense of identity ......... and would, at its best, prove anintegrating and educative force in the life of the local community&quot; (White Paper on Broadcasting, December 1966,Cmnd. 3169).2..     Before assessing the experiment, which began inNovember, 1967 with the opening of the station at Leicester, Iconsulted a wide range of opinion: MPs whose constituencies are served by the eight local stations (their views are summarised at Appendix A), local authorities in those areas, nationalassociations representing local authorities, commerce andindustry, and the press, trades unions, hational organisations concerned with social, cultural and educational questions andthe Churches.    I understand H.M. Inspectorate had prepared areport on the educational programmes from the stations.    Iinvited the public in the areas with local stations to send meviews.    I have received a number of deputations (their views are summarised at Appendix B).    I have also had full reports fromthe BBC (circulated in B(69) 3      ) and from the Chairmen of the eight Local Broadcasting Councils.    Officials from myDepartment have visited all the stations and attended meetingsof all the Councils.   During my review, I hope to fit in oneor two visits myself,3.     Each local station is broadcasting locally produced material for about forty-eight hours each week.    Of this, local news andcommentary programmes, particularly the treatment in depth of local controversies is perhaps of first importance; but it includes many educational programmes with a local slant e.g.local history, geology, as well as entertainment programmes -ranging from record requests to satire.    I am satisfied thatthere is ample local material to provide informative,interesting and entertaining programmes for a general service.
h.     I am satisfied, too,  that there is a real demand for local radio.    Ideally, the experimental period would have been longer,so as to give the stations more time to establish themselves andto win audiences.   The first station has been operating foreighteen months, the last - Durham - for less than a year.Also the fact that they transmit only on VHF , while mostlisteners have only medium and long wave sets, has of courselimited their impact.   However,  the following table shows thatwell over half of those able to listen to the station do so,and nearly a third do so frequently.Average over the eight stationsAdult population Proportion of adult Proportion of adultequipped to population who                 population who receive listen to local                listen to locallocal radio radio radio   frequently43 per cent 26 per cent 1U per centIn numerical terms, nearly a million people are listening andover half a million are listening frequently.

For the experiment itself the method of finance propoundedin the White Paper may be judged a moderate success.    Of thetotal annual running costs of the eight stations,  just over one half ( 316,000) has been provided from local sources,almost entirely by local authorities.    Since the BBC were,implicitly, bound to underwrite the experiment, the result is better than might have been expected.   But it is now plain that local voluntary contributions cannot be relied upon as a source of substantial financial support.   I am circulating a separate &quot;memorandum on methods of financing local radio. -..T ,6,     The question whether the experimental service has helped^to^realise the general social objectives we prescribed in the .White Paper (see paragraph 1 above) cannot be appraised solely by the quantitative results.   Here a qualitative appraisalis equally important.   The general consensus of opinion of thoseI have consulted or who have written to me is that these &apos;Lexpectations have been realised.   Local authorities and individuals have commented on the helpful information given bythe local station, especially during emergencies e.g. about roadconditions, escaped prisoners, transport services.   They havealso appreciated local news, especially the extended coverage of council meetings and local sport.   The Arts Council of GreatBritain and local cultural organisations have commentedfavourably on the coverage given to news of local concerts,theatres, etc. and there is some evidence that attendances at.
7.     During the recent debate on the Greater London RadioAuthority Bill,  there was general agreement on both sides ofthe House that the local radio experiment had been a success andthat there was a demand for local radio.    My consultationsconfirm this;  local radio has enhanced the sense of community and created a feeling of public participation, not only inthe station itself but in local affairs.    One of the realproblems we have to face is apathy and discontent becausepeople feel that they are out of touch with the processes ofgovernment and decision making.    To redress this, a majorcommunication gap must be bridged.    I think local radio couldplay a major part in achieving this purpose.    I believe that,provided tho financial requirement can be satisfactorily met,we should authorise a general service of local radio.    I amsetting out my proposals for such a service in a separate memorandum.J.

It is clear that listeners already regard the localstation as their own, and the station staff as friends; I havehad many letters imploring me not to close down &quot;our localstation&quot;.

They made itclear to me that they were not prepared to contribute on this scale in future; some of them appeared to envisage a tokencontribution of  5,000 a year.    Most of them thought local radio should be financed by the BBC from the licence fee.They wanted to be able to nominate representatives to theLocal Broadcasting Councils.APPENDIX BDEPUTATIONS1 -     Organisations concerned with the provincial press the Newspaper SocietyThe Printing and Kindred Trades federation the National Union of JournalistsAll of these organisations are concerned that local radio shouldnot be financed by advertising, which they consider would causemany provincial papers to close down.    In the last resort,  the newspaper Society would accept commercial local radio if thelocal press could share the profits, but the NUJ and the printing and Kindred Trades Federation reject this solution,which they consider will not safeguard their members&apos;  employment and which would lead to an undesirable monopoly in the controlof local news media.
(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^S GOVERNMENT)........ j/TB(69)520th June 1969COPY NO.cabinet ministerial COMMITTEE ON BROADCASTINGBROADCAST RECEIVING LICENCE EVASION1.      My earlier memorandum (B(69)2)  mentions  the problem of  theloss of revenue  to  the BBC through evasion of  the broadcastreceiving licence requirements.    The present memorandum appraisesthe extent of  the problem,   the progress made during recent yearsand suggests action for  the future.    My colleagues will wish  tokeep the appraisal and suggestions  in view in considering  thefinancial  implications of plans for  local radio.2.      There are at present nearly 18 million broadcast receivinglicences in force  (15^ million combined sound and  televisionlicences of which 105,000 are for colour  television;  and2.4 million sound licences).    These licences bring in a revenue of about  95 million annually for the BBC.     In September 1966,the number of  television licence evaders was estimated at over two million or 13.4 per cent of  the homes with  television.    InMarch 1968,   the estimated number of   television licence evaders was1,2 million or 7,4 per cent.    The number of  sound licenceevaders is not known but we suspect  there may be  some 2 million people who have radio sets installed in cars but have no licence.There is nothing to be ashamed of in our efforts  to reduce evasion,We have done much better  than we hoped.    It is  a success story.However,   the loss of revenue  through television licence evasion,at an estimated S.7^mt  a year,  remains  far  too high.    Clearly,   ifwe could reduce it  still further  the BBCs financial positionwould be easier,3.      Progress  in reducing evasion during  the last  two years hasbeen due  to:(a) The Wireless Telegraphy Act 1967      The objective wastwo-fold:   to make detection much more  likely and deterrencemuch more effective -  the first by requiring all dealersto notify my Department of  all   sales and rentals of  tele-vision sets since January 1968,   the  second by sharplyincreasing the permitted level  of fines on detectedevaders.    The first objective is being pursued with- 1   -
considerable  success.    In the first year of   the  scheme&apos;soperation,  nearly 300,000  television licences were  taken out following notifications by dealers  and some  30,000sound licences were surrendered for  television licences;and over 13,000 people were prosecuted for unlicensed use.Some of  these people would have been induced to  take outlicences,  or detected,  without  the dealers1   information;I  cannot  say how many.    However,   the scheme,  while creating a lot of work for  the Post Office,  has enabled us  to concentrate our efforts on known targets.    The additional revenue attributable  to  the scheme in the first year of operation was  estimated at about  1,7m.  and  the  total estimated staff costs  in that period were  just under 200,000.    The  second objective has not been realised.Though the Act increased the maximum penalty for  evasionfrom  10  to  50 for the  first offence and from  50  to  100for  the second and subsequent offences,   in general,Magistrates are not using  the power.    There are few finesof over  20 even for  several  years&apos;  evasion,   and themajority are in the  5  to  10 range.(b) The existing fleet of nine detector cars will havebeen increased to  twenty by the  early autumn.(c) Publici ty      The passage of  the Wireless TelegraphyBill  in the  summer of 1967  got wide news coverage andat the  same  time  there was a campaign of pa-id advertise-ments in the press.    During  this period,   there was a mostnoticeable increase in the number  of  licences which rosesharply from 13.9 million in January 1967  to 14.7 million in September  1967.    In the summer of  1968,  a series of short filler  films was  shown on BBC and ITV and  the BBCmade announcements about licence requirements,   e.g.  onBBC2 about  the need for colour licences.    It  is difficultto  judge whether  this had any significant effect on licencefigures which,   though  they increased overall by half  amillion during  1968,   fluctuated from month  to month.    Inthe winter  and autumn of  1968-69,   local  publicity campaignswere held in seven areas.    These involved the use ofposters,  detector cars,   letters  to members of  the public and advertisements  and news items  in local newspapers.These campaigns have been very effective;   the  total  costwas of  the order of  16,500 and the additional  revenueproduced was  154,000.4.      It is clear from the press comment which has accompanied the speculation about  the BBCs plans for restructuring  theirradio services,   that both the BBC and the public will expect the Government to make a determined effort to reduce  the licenceevasion still  further and recover some of  the  7^m. now beinglost.    I have been considering how best   this could be done.The increased activity against licence evasion during the lasttwo years has put  a heavy burden on the  staff  in local  postoffices.    The basic grade doing  licence enforcement work is- 2 -
4 per cent under establishment   throughout  the country as a whole and the situation is worse in many of the largest  towns whereevasion is highest.    This  shortage is long standing,   and evenif we were prepared to increase the number of posts assigned to this work,   it  is unlikely that they  could be  filled.    any measures which involve work in local  offices will have  to beconsidered against  this background.    It is  therefore a questionof deploying  the existing staff resources to the best advantagerather than increasing  the  total  amount of work  to be done.50      For  this reason,   I  have ruled out any special  attempt toreduce sound licence evasion.    Sound licence evasion is far moredifficult  to detect.    We have no detector cars for sound radio and the modern set is easily concealed.    Also,   the return in revenue for  the effort involved is considerably less.    Similarly,I  do not  think it would be helpful  at present  if  the TransportDepartments were  to use the powers given in Section 8 of  the wireless Telegraphy Act 1967  to include questions  about car radioson the Vehicle Excise Licence  form.    Neither  the Post Office northe local  authorities could process  this information and I   see no point in obtaining information which we cannot handle.    Thebluff would quickly be blown and the whole  system brought into disrepute.    However,  when  the records for both vehicle licences andbroadcast:receiving licences have been computerised.in the next fewyears,   it would be possible  to use this power and stop  this parti-cular &quot;kind of  evasion.6.      The BBC have  suggested that I   should activate Section 3(2)of the Wireless Telegraphy Act  1967,  under which I may requiretelevision dealers  to notify me of rental   and hire purchaseagreements entered into before January 1968 or even before  the1967 Act was passed.    Under the  terms of  the Section,  I  haveto give  the dealers at least twelve months&apos;  notice in writing of such a request.    Because of  the progress being made  in reducing evasion and in order to keep  the dealers&apos;  goodwill,we did not use this power immediately.    I  see objections  tousing it now;  again,   the Post Office would find it difficultto process  this additional   information as well  as &quot;the currentnotifications,  running at 2 million a year.    The request wouldbe greatly resented by the  trade,  which has  so  far proved co-operative in operating the principal notification scheme; butthis additional burden could put  co-operation at risk.    I  am advised moreover  that  the average length of a rental  agreement is  three years.    If  this  is so,  more  than half the  rentals will soon have been picked up under  the normal  arrangements.    It is unlikely that a large proportion of  the  I5 million evaders arethose with long-term rental  or hire purchase agreements.    invite my colleagues to agree that  there would be little pointin activating Section 3(2) of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1967.7.      The most likely way to make further significant  inroadsinto the number of evaders  is by increased publicity.     In viewof the public interest  already created in the BBCs proposals,I   think we should aim for a major publicity exercise in thelate summer and early autumn of  this year.    I  suggest  thisshould take  the form of  a new series of filler  films  to be -
shown nationally by  the BBC and on independent  television andthat  this  should be followed up by a further series  of  localcampaigns early in the New Year.    I  am advised that  this wouldbe more  effective  than a national press advertising campaign.8.      There is obviously a hard core of  evaders whom it wouldbe uneconomic  to pursue relentlessly,  but I  consider  that a sustained attempt  should be made to reduce  the number of evadersto 0.75 million by  this  time next year,   and to hold it  thereagainst a rising total  of  television households.     In my view,this is  the very most that will be practicable;   and it wouldbe undesirable to publish a figure  as a target.    Even if wehit  it,   the extra revenue  in a full year would be only  3m.This will not  therefore solve the BECs immediate need forfurther  finance for its radio services nor would it  pay for ageneral   service of  forty local  radio stations at  100,000 eachyear.9.      When the Pop&apos;1 Office becomes a public  corporation later this year,   there will  have  to be changes in the present organisation of  licence work.    While  the Minister of posts and Telecommunications will  remain responsible  for  licensingthe uses of wireless  telegraphy generally,   and so  for broadcastreceiving licence policy including  the  level  of  the  licence fee,   the Post Office Corporation will continue  to issue broad-cast receiving licences on the Minister&apos;s behalf and to enforce the licence system.    The Ministry will not  have  the  localinfrastructure on which both issue and enforcement depend.There will  be a contract,   the  terms of which remain  to be worked out between  the Minister and the Post Office Corporation,to cover  these arrangements;   it will  of  course be  essential   thatthe  terms of  this contract should ensure that  the Minister1spolicy will be carried out effectively and efficiently by thePost Office.    The method of payment will be a major factor in achieving this objective.     I  have  three possibilities  in mind:(i)  a fixed price for  each  transaction,   to encouragecost stability;(ii)  payment by results,   though this might present difficulties of definition;(iii)  costs plus a flat rate profit charge.As anti-evasion measures had more and more effect,  we oughtto see a decline  in their costs  in real   terms.10.    Plans are well  advanced for  transferring  licence records and much of  the enforcement work to  a computerised system.    Thefirst trials of  the  system are  taking place at Croydon and willbe assessed shortly;   the results so far  are encouraging.    Itis planned to extend the  system to several more offices aroundLondon this year and then to  spread  through  the country.    Thisis a considerable task;   it is  too early yet  to estimate when itcan be accomplished -  this depends partly on the  staff recources4 -
which can be made available,  but I  hope  it can be done withina couple of years from now.    It is unlikely that  the  computerisedsystem will  lead to any dramatic decrease in costs but  rather that it will  enable.the work to be done more effectively.However,  in the last resort,  enforcement depends on havingstaff available  to knock on people&apos;s doors and  to ask  to see their licence or obtain evidence of unlicensed use on whicha prosecution can be based.    Without   this  sanction,   the mostelaborate system is unlikely to be effective.11.    In summary therefore I  propose:(i)   to make a major effort  to reduce  the number of television licence evaders  to 0.75 million by August 1970;(ii)  in order  to do  this,   to launch a major nationalpublicity exercise later  this  year,   to be  followed upearly next year by a series of local campaigns,  butnot at  this  stage to implement Sections  3(2)  or 8 ofthe Wireless Telegraphy Act 1967.I think this is the right order of additional effort to devote to this problem. But I should welcome my colleagues&apos;vi ews.J.T. S.General Post Office,St. Martin&apos; s-le-Grand,London,  E.C.120th  June 19695
ItHIS-DOCUMENTb(69)6 copy no.20th June. 1969.cabinet ministerial committee on broadcasting the FUTURE OF THE NATIONAL RADIO services memorandum by the Postmaster GeneralThe BBC&apos;s plan1.     The BBC have now informed us of their draft plan for thefuture structure of national sound broadcasting.    It is described below and its main implications considered.   The BBC&apos;s plan for local radio is considered in paper B(69)h   and is not includedhere.2.     The BBC&apos;s objectives are twofold: to restructure theprogramme pattern in the light of changes in listening habitscaused by television and the demand for pop; and to effecteconomies sufficient to contain the cost of national sound broadcasting within existing sound radio licence revenue.The future structure3.     They see the first objective as being best achieved byclassifying programme networks by type (pop, light music, speech,serious music, education) rather than, as is   partly the case atpresent, by level of &quot;brow&quot;.   Briefly, by the mid-1970&apos;s the bbc aim to provide:(a) Radio 1 much as at present, concentrating on pop musicbut including news summaries at each clock hour.(b) Radio 2, completely separated (except in the evening)from Radio 1, putting out continuous light music (other thanpop) and short news bulletins every hour at the half hour,with occasional news flashes.(c) Radio 3 with more classical  music, keeping serioustwentieth century music and some drama of minority appeal,but excluding news and documentary matter.    The musicalcontent would rise from 50 per cent to 75 per cent.    Stereowould be extended.   The title &quot;Third Programme&quot; would be dropped.- 1 -
(d)   Radio hi evolving into a wholly speech programmeincluding drama and general entertainment features (someof them taken from Radio 2 and Radio 3) hut with the emphasis on providing wide cover for news and other factual anddocumentary programmes.h.     These reforms could not be brought into effect at once:(a) at present, Radio 1 and 2 run in double harness for much of the day.    Separating them means playing more records and re-negotiating the BBC&apos;s &quot;needle time&quot; agreement withPhonographic     Performance Ltd, who own the rights and withthe Musicians&apos; Union.   Negotiations with the Union could take a long time;(b) there would not be enough programme time on Radio hto enable it to take over programme items from Radios 2 and3 and at the same time accommodate the schools and further education programmes.   The BBC will shortly be formulatingproposals for re-arranging educational broadcasting.    Theyhave in mind that from late 1971, of the duplicatetransmissions of Radio h - one on medium wave, the other onVHP - the VHF  transmission should carry all educationalprogrammes.   When not in use for that purpose, it would continue to duplicate Radio k.gsonomies - the need5.     These measures are aimed at modernising and rationalisingthe service and are not, of themselves, primarily directed towardseffecting economies.    However, the BBC consider that, the cost oflocal radio apart, either economies must be made in addition tothose emerging from McKinsey&apos;s recommendations, or else the revenues of the BBC must be increased.    Otherwise their deficit on nationalsound radio will have built up to  6.5m. by 1974.6.     The most obvious sources of additional finance would be:(a) revenue from advertising on radio.   This the BBC rejectnot only on the familiar grounds of principle, which I support,but because a decision to create a commercial system financed from advertising should not be taken merely to overcome animmediate economic difficulty;(b) a subvention from the television element in the licencefees.   A possibility would be to rationalise the presentlicensing system by abolishing the need for separate soundlicences with a compensating addition of, say, 5s. Od. on the combined sound and television licence fee.    (At present, itcosts over 5s. Od. per licence to run the licensing system.At a licence fee level of 25s. Od.  it would not be profitablegreatly to increase expenditure on enforcement and the licensing of sound receivers is, in any case, not completelyenforceable);- 2 -
(c) an increase in the sound licence fee of 5s. Od. has &quot;beensuggested (in a later paper, I will consider as a separateissue a possible 5s. Od. increase to pay for local radio -and additional service).(d) the Government to pay for schools and furthereducational broadcasts as well as for Open Universitybroadcasts (See paragraph U(b) above).    The corporation have in mind an amount of  2m. over the whole period till197^ and about  0.65m. per annum when the scheme is in full operation.   The BBC&apos;s calculations assume that we will accept this proposal; but the survival of their plan forrestructuring radio does not depend upon it.The economies proposed - their implications7. The BBC&apos;s main proposals for additional economies (which they regard as highly desirable also on their merits) are:(a) to eliminate regional &apos;opt-outs&apos; for the three english regions outside London: North (at Newcastle and Manchester)Midlands (Birmingham) and South and West (Bristol).    Thiswould save about  2m. over the years 1970-7U.   Regionalopt-out programmes would continue to be available forScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.    English regionalproduction for the national network would also continue;(b) to economise in those programmes which are mostexpensive to produce, through greater efficiency in dramaproduction and a considerable reduction of live orchestralmusic.The financial effects are tabulated in the Annex.8.     Though the loss of regional opt-outs implies at first sighta degradation of service, the weekly amount of opt-out materialper region is - at a characteristic 1U hours - small.    Given the size of the regions, much of it is irrelevant anyway.    It is toa service of local radio that the BBC would look for a meaningful?community-orientated, component in their total service.    If we donot authorise local radio the BBC would fall back on area radio,v/ith opt-outs, from eight centres in England.   This, very much asecond best, would in their view be the least they could do tocomplete the provision of a comprehensive radio service suited tothe current needs of listeners.9*     Programme content apart, the BBC plan would imply changes inthe extent of reception of their national radio services, asfollows:(a)    an improvement in the coverage attained by, and thequality of the reception of, Radios 1 and k; Radio 1coverage would improve by 10 per cent by day; and bothRadio 1 and Radio h coverage by about one third at night;- 3 -
(b) Radio 3, restricted to VHF , would not be receivable onmedium wave only sets.    I have considerable reservations about this proposal which would reduce the potential audience forRadio 3 by over 60 per cent.   There are only about six millionVHP sets out of a total of possibily twenty million sets ofall kinds.   There are particular implications for car radiolisteners. Of perhaps 3 million car radios, the number withVHP is extremely small and there are technical problems inobtaining good reception of VHF  in moving motor vehicles;(c) listeners who have bought VHF  sets to get the bestreception of Radio k would not be able to hear Radio 1+ onVHP at times when educational programmes are being transmitted,,Conversely,(d) educational programmes would be receivable only on VHF .Individuals and institutions (including schools) wanting toreceive the programmes, would need to have VHF  sets;(e) stereo transmissions, now confined to the VHF  versionsof Radio 3 in London, Dover, the Midlands and the North,would be further extended on VHF .Industry would welcome a decision to broadcast some nationalservices (i.e. Radio 3 and educational broadcasts) in VHF  only;but would no doubt prefer it if more popular national service had been selected.    There would be a similarly muted welcome by industry for the extension of stereo.   My advisers have yet toreceive a detailed exposition of the BBC&apos;s technical proposals and they must be subject to further examination.10,   But perhaps the most difficult consequence of the BBC&apos;s planflows from the proposed reduction of output of expensive programmes(paragraph 7(b) above).    The main brunt would fall on theorchestras employed by the BBC.    The argument is that the BBC have more orchestras than they need; and that the licence payer shouldnot be called upon to support them beyond the specific broadcastingneed.   The BBC estimates that an aggregate saving of  5.0m. can be :achieved over the years 1970-7^4- by increasing needle time anddisbanding orchestras.   Of the thirteen orchestras at presentemployed by the BBC, the following, which the BBC regard as thebest would be retained:The BBC Symphony OrchestraThe BBC Radio OrchestraThe Midland Light OrchestraThe BBC Northern Symphony OrchestraThe Scottish Radio OrchestraThose disbanded virould be:The London Studio PlayersThe BBC Training OrchestraThe BBC Scottish Symphony OrchestraThe Northern Dance OrchestraThe BBC Chorus
Three others would he kept on only if supplementary financialcontributions from other sources were available.    These are:The BBC Concert OrchestraThe Welsh OrchestraThe Northern Ireland OrchestraIf all these disbandments were put into effect the result wouldbe that, of the 608 orchestral musicians now employed by the bbc, 329 would become redundant.   Lord Hill has promisedLord Goodman to consult him before final decisions are taken.11.   No doubt it will be represented that the BBC have a general responsibility for patronising the arts.    The Corporation^ answerwould be that their responsibility to the arts is only incidental to their duty to provide broadcasting services.    I do not share the BBC&apos;s view that the licence payer does not expect it to engage in patronage for its own sake.   There is no point in having a national broadcasting institution in such a privileged positionunless it is prepared to do so.   But, obviously, a line has to bedrawn somewhere and that is the issue to be determined^,Public reaction12.   Likely to prompt the strongest public reaction are the elimination of regional opt-outs   and the disbandment oforchestras.   But most listeners stand to gain if local stations,or even area stations, replace the present irrelevant system of english regional opt-outs.   Presentationally,  it would benecessary to stress that English regional production for thenational services would continue.13.   The disbandment of orchestras, particularly the proposal to disband a Scottish and, possibly, a Welsh and Northern Irelandorchestra, would certainly prompt strong reactions.   The BBC&apos;sargument is that performances on gramophone records would bean improvement on the live performances of the orchestras inquestion.   The BBC also say that, given the present number oforchestras, they are not fully utilised even now.    It might bewor-th&apos;- &apos;--iJ:c&apos;;le for the BBC to consider whether additional uses fororchestras could not be found in other ways e.g. by givingperformances in schools, municipal parks, at seaside resorts,etc.   There might also be a special case for considering anArts Council subvention for the BBC Training Orchestra.- 5 -
15.   My colleagues will, no doubt, wish to reserve final judgmentuntil we have had time to gauge reaction after publication of theplan early next month.    My own initial reaction is that giventhe need to economise many of the proposals are eminentlysensible, but I have strong reservations on some of the BBCsuggestions.J. T.

(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)..... .....     - . .B(69)7 COPY NO.    1 vqth July. 1969.cabinet ministerial COMMITTEE ON broadcasting hours OF broadcasting memorandum by the Postmaster general.     In my view, control by Government of the amouht of broadcastingtime is now wrong in principle, and unduly restrictive in practice:and I have announced that I am reviewing it.   It would be convenient to announce the outcome at the same time as we announce a decisionon local radio.The present system.     In a typical week, BBC 1 broadcasts for some 83 hours a week,ITV 77 hours and BBC 2 37 hours.   These totals are composed asfollows:(i)    the so called weekly &quot;maximum&quot; -BBC 1 &amp; ITV 53i hours a weekBBC 2 32 hours a week; plus(ii)    the additional allowance for outside broadcasts -BBC 1 &amp; ITV k50 hours a yearBBC 2 225 hours a year; plus(iii)    the exempted classes - i.e. classes of programme the transmission time of which does not count towards the weeklymaximum, e.g.  schools broadcasts and adult education broadcasts;religious, ministerial and party political broadcasts; andbroadcasts in the Welsh language.   For radio, I prescribe clockAflnex l       hours.   The current rules are annexed.Review bg Prof. Wedell and Mr. Blake3.     In March of this year I decided to commission an independents 2 x2 review by Prof. George Wedell and Mr. Brian Blake.    I annex thereport I have received from them.   In brief, their analysis of theposition is as follows:(i)    the broadcasting authorities should in principle be given full responsibility for deciding for themselves the amount oftime required for their servioes.   They should assume the duty- 1 -
of ensuring that sufficient time is given to minority-programmes (notably schools broadcasts and adult educationprogrammes) at present protected by the exempt categories;(ii)   programmes of the latter kind would, they judge, surviveif restrictions were dropped;(iii)   in practice dropping the restrictions would mean an extra I2 hours a day in term-time.   Cheaper types of programmes would be used at a cost of about  lm a year per network,, I see no reason to challenge this assessment, though I think it quite possible that the cost could build up to  1^-rn to  2m a yearper network (i.e. up to 2s. 6d. per licence-holder met either as part of an increase in licence fees or by cutting other expenditure) in time;(iv)   BBC television income, principally licence revenue,,will grow slightly over the next few years.   They seem to foreseea slightly greater increase in independent television1 s income.,.(v)    the, ^authorisation, of.a fourth television channel would makelittle difference to the issue;(vi)   a relaxation of the rules would provide a useful test ofthe strength of the structure of the two broadcasting organisations in resisting pressures against minoritypro gramme s.I do not of course follow Professor Wedell and Mr. Blake in all the particulars of their report.   They are wrong on some secondarypoints of fact; and some of their opinions - e*g. their strictures(paragraph 17) on our 1966 White Paper and their assertions(paragraph 32) on the nature of the relationship between theprogramme planners and the two governing bodies - are gratuitous.However, in total their report provides an interesting and usefulanalysis of the problem.Alternative decisions open to usAbolition of the controlsk*     Although I understand the considerations which led mycolleagues to conclude in 1966 that the present controls shouldcontinue, it seems to me that the time has come for a change.    Mypreference is for complete abolition of the controls.    This wouldhave the following effects-:(i)   it would remove the conflict with the principle of theindependence, in the day-to-day conduct of their affairs, ofthe broadcasting authorities from intervention by Government.Within their available resources, we should leave broadcastingtime to them;(ii)   abolition would be well received on all sides inParliament, and might be quite popular with the public;(iii)   abolition would make possible greater flexibility, moreexperimental programmes which might encourage programme exportsmore use of independent television&apos;s surplus production capacity resulting from the new contract structure established under Lord Hill&apos;&apos;s chairmanship;- 2 -
(iv)    it would be welcomed by the leading independent television companies and regarded by them as a slightcompensation for the recent three per cent increase in the incidence of the television levy.    They might see it asbalancing a decision favourable to the BBC on local radio.It would remove a minor complication from programme planning and might produce a marginal saving.    It would give thecompanies a little more advertising time, but not much of itat near peak hours so  that it would be no great money-spinner.My powers of control under the Television Act and the BBC Licenceand Agreement would in&apos;any case remain, but I would in futuretreat them as reserve powers in the strictest sense.    Control havingbeen relinquished, it could not be reimposed save in an extremesituation.A ma,jor relaxation and simplification of the rules, but withoxitoutright abolition5.     As my colleagues will have noted, Prof. We dell and Mr. Blake,recommend a major relaxation and simplification of the rules, but without outright abolition.    They propose that I should amend theexisting rules to read as follows:provided that the total number of hours of transmission of any oneof these programme services shall not exceed k.732 hours a year&quot;(i.e. 91 hours a week on average).   A relaxation on this scale wouldhave much the same consequences as outright abolition.    Its &apos;.practical differences from outright abolition would be:(i)    the general prohibition of breakfast-time broadcastingsThis is the development which the BBC regard as having in the longer run the most serious implications for programming.    Isympathise with the BBC&apos;s views, but I do not think theyshould be allowed to prevail;(ii)    the general prohibition of broadcasting between 12.30 aoffi.and 9.15 a.m., apparently designed to protect people trying toget to sleep against noise from their neighbours&apos; televisionreceivers.    This restriction would,  I suspect, be popular, butI see little justification for using my powers for this kindof purpose.   The prevention of nuisance is not one of myfunctions.The status quo6.     The major considerations which can be argued in favour of thestatus quo are the financial implications for the BBC, the effecton minority programmes of the kind in the present exempt categories,and the prospective effect on consumer spending-:&quot;BBC 1 )ITV )BBC 2 )15 a.m. to 12.30 a.m. daily3 -
(i)   With Prof, Wedell and Mr. Blake, I do not think that itwould he significant if bbc were to broadcast up to 2 houraa day less than ITV, but this need not necessarily be thecase.(ii)   it can, I know, be argued that provision for exemptedcategories provides the best guarantee, in a competitivesituation, that enough time will be given to these particularminority programmes.    But I believe that these programmes arenow firmly established.   The Broadcasting authorities would be unwilling to take short-term advantage from de-restriction Inview of the impending major review of broadcasting..(iii) I recognise that any increase in television advertisingunless it totally fails in its purpose, is bound to increaseexpenditure on comsumer goods, and so go against our immediateeconomic strategy, but I would expect its effect to be trivialcompared to the relaxation which the two broadcasting organisations and receiver manufacturers are at present urgingin credit restrictions on colour television sets.,Radio7,    There is very little demand for any increase in radio hours,However, if I were abolishing control of television hours, it wouldbe anomalous to maintain control of radio hours, and so I wouldabolish that also.Oonclus ion8.     I invite my colleagues to decide between(i)    maintenance of the status quo;or      (ii)    complete abolition of the controls;or     (iii)    the proposal for partial abolition containedin the Wedell Report (paragraph 106),9.    I would propose to announce the decision to Parliament beforethe summer recess, if possible at the same time as announcing other decisions on broadcasting, including local radio.J . T.

In Strictest ConfidenceHours of Television Broadcastingreport of a stud3rundertaken at the request ofthe Right Honourable John Stonehouse, M.P.,Postmaster GeneralbyProfessor E.G, Wedelland Brian BlakeJune, 1969.
uuinIn Strictest ConfidenceHours of Television BroadcastingIntroductionWe were asked &quot;to advise&apos;the Postmaster General, in the light of relevant social and economic considerations, on the advisability of extending the present limits on hours of television broadcasting forthe TIA Programme Companies and the BBC, either by a limited amount,by a series of extensions phased over a limited time, or by removingexisting limits altogether.&quot;Two wishes expressed by the Postmaster General have of necessitylimited the scope of this enquiry:   its confidential nature and itsurgency,   v/e have therefore had to proceed on the basis of the repliesreceived by the General Post Office to the letter sent by Mr. Wood tothe broadcasting organisations on 18th March;   on such informal conversations as ire v/e re able to arrange without disclosing our objective;   on such published material on the subject as is available;and on our own experience, knowledge and opinions.   There have beenneither time nor resources for extensive research.V/e divide our report into sections:A. AssumptionsB. The present situation and the backgroundC. Social considerations0. Economic considerationsE, Structural considerationsF. RecommendationsA.   ASSIMPIIOHSOur approach to the possibility of relaxing or abolishing the rulegoverning television broadcasting is based on certain assumptions aboutthe limits within which the Postmaster General and the Government feelfree to act at the present time.   These assumptions are:i.   That there should be no general increase in the televisionlicence fee in the near future.ii.   That the Government will, for some time to come, be anxious not to encourage consumer spending.iii.   That the Government will be anxious to avoid increases in capital investment in the public sector, of which the broad-casting organisations form part,iv.   That our recommendations must be related to the present range of three television services with near-national coverage,   (weconsider briefly in paragraph 84 the extent to which theintroduction of a fourth television channel would cause us tomodify our recommendations).v. That our recommendations should relate in the first instance tothe period between now and the expiry of the Television Act andthe BBC Charter in the middle of 1976.
We were informed by the broadcasting organisations that their current hours of broadcasting are as indicated in the sample weeks below:BBC-1	London and South East	82	hours	49 minutes	North Region	83	hours	3 minutesBBC-2	London and South East	37	hours	30 minutes	North Region	37	hours	30 minutesrrv	London	77	hours	appropriate.	Central Scotland	74	hours	appropriate.The BBC figures relate to the week 22nd-28th March 1969;   those forirV are said to be typical for current output.   In both cases thefigures refer to transmissions during school terms.   In the holidaysITV London programmes run for about three hours less;   those in central Scotland for five hours less.   Since BBC educational output is in volume about twice that of ITV, there are correspondinglylarger reductions in programme hours on BBC-1.It is useful to compare the actual transmission hours shown inthe previous paragraph with the maximum permitted hours of generalbroadcasting under   rule 1  of the Rules on Hours of Broadcastingissued by the Postmaster General on 18th February, 1969.BBC-1       53jjr hours a weekBBC-2        32      &quot;     &quot;     11ITV 53l     &quot;     &quot;     &quot;The balance of almost 30 hours on BBC 1 and 24 hours on ITV is accountedfor by programmes exempted from the restriction on hours under rule 2 ofthe Rules on Hours:   religious programmes, ministerial or party political broadcasts, outside broadcasts up to a maximum of 450 hours      a year(BBC-1 and ITV) and 225 hours (in the case of BBC-2);   school broad-casts;   adult education broadcasts;   broadcasts in Welsh, etc.The bulk of the additional hours, on all channels, is taken up byschool   and adult education programmes.   In the week May 10th-16th, forinstance, BBC-1 North carried 14.25 hours of school programmes and 5,30hours of adult education programmes, a total of 19.55 hours.It will be noted that the proportion of additional hours on BBC 2is smaller than that on the other two services.   During our discussionsit was made clear to us by the representatives of the BBC that theCorporation^ concern over parity of hours relates primarily to paritybetween BBC-1 and ITV.The history of the television hours rules differs from those forsound radio because the former were developed in a competitive situation.The sound radio rules merely prescribe the clock times during which thevarious BBC services may broadcast.   In the case of the experimentallocal sound broadcasting stations not even this restriction was thought necessary;   financial stringency lias tended to limit transmission times to well within the national sound services.   It is, however, open toany local service to transmit outside these hours.   The fact that none of the stations have done so also reflects the listening habits of theiraudiences.   This suggests that patterns of demand, as well as financialpressures, are significant determinants of broadcasting output.
We were informed by Mr. Lawrence that the television hours ruleswere introduced initially to protect Independent Television againstcompetition from the BBC service, which was already well established.In more recent years they have been regarded as serving the reversepurpose&apos;,   to protect the BBC from ITV competition.Chapter IE of the Report of the Committee on Broadcasting 1960describes the position regarding hours of broadcasting as it then was,and sets out the expression of views made to the Committee both by thebroadcasters and by other organisations.   In the light of these theCommittee considered the current prescriptions and decided to recommendonly one minor change:   the revocation of the rule requiring that pro-grammes between 2.0 and 4o0 p.mc on Sundays should be designed for adults.Although we were not asked to take the Pilkington Committee&apos;views as our point of departure, it is useful to ask what changes havetaken place since the Committee&apos;s consideration of the matter in 1961.There appear to us to be at least four significant respects in whichthe situation today differs from that eight years ago.In the first place the Television Act 1964 places the HA in amuch more commanding position in the determination of the programmecontent of the Independent Television system.   Thus the Authority itselfcan now be held responsible for the programme content of its service,including those elements which the categories at present exempt underthe Hours Rules are designed to encourageSecondly, the volume of television output by the BBC has grown agood deal faster than the Corporation envisaged when giving evidence tothe Pilkington Committee.   At that time it thought that the combinedoutput of two television services might increase to about IOC hours inthe six year period 1964-70,1)   In fact, as is indicated in paragraph 1,the output of the two television services is already about 120 hours perweek after only five years.Again, the financial position of Independent Television is nolonger such as to enable the system to overwhelm the BBC in terms ofquantity of output,,   The recent increase in the rate of incidence of the television levy has further reduced the system&apos;s capacity in this respect.Moreover, the regulatory mechanism provided by the levy enables theGovernment further to reduce any excessive competitive capacity of TfVif this should prove necessary.There has, lastly, developed during the last few years a recognitionon the part of the two broadcasting organisations of their commonresponsibilities which did not obtain when the Pilkington Committee wassitting.   Reference was made to this recognition in the 1966 White paper on Broadcasting:   &quot;Though Parliament has placed them (the broadcasting organisations) in competition with each other, they have a commonobjective of public service.&quot;   The Government also affirmed that &quot;Sincefull responsibility is required of them, they must be afforded full authority to secure that their services are conducted in the general interest.&quot;3&apos;&apos;The practical implications of this affirmation for the control of hours were given little attention in the White Paper.   The governingbodies, to whose sense of responsibility such weight was attached inparagraph 48, were entirely ignored in paragraph 45 which dealt withhours.   Paragraph 47 merely claimed that &quot;the amount of broadcastingtime would remain a matter of sufficient social importance to require that the Postmaster General should continue to hold and exercise his present powers of control,&quot;   This seems to us an inadequate treatmentof the subject.   We therefore propose now to consider the arrangementsfor the control of hours in the context of the developments described in paragraphs 13-16 above.
C,   SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS18. The social considerations relevant to decision-making in thefield of broadcasting hours reay conveniently be expressed in theform of propositions:a. Viewers should be given the widest range of choicescompatible with the technical and financial limitations of a television output of high quality.b. It should be recognised that viewers in an increasinglyeducated society are able to regulate the inflow of television into their homes themselves by discriminatinguse of the switch.c. Citizens should be protected from exposure to noise nuisancefrom other people&apos;s television receivers (as from their radioreceivers) during normal hours of sleep.Evidence of Demand for Additional Hours19. When these general propositions are applied to the determination of broadcasting hours, they support in principle the extension of the broadcasting day to all reasonable waking hours.   There is, inprinciple, no reason why television services should not extend overthe same range of hours (roughly 5.30 a.m, to   2,02 a.m.) as thoseduring which sound broadcasting is permitted.   During all these hourssome viewers no doubt would be glad to watch television.20. In practice, the pattern of life of most people precludes theirviewing during most of the hours at present not covered by television.Ibe BBC survey &quot;The People&apos;s Activities&quot; &apos; showed, for instance, that between 30 and 40% of the adult population (15 years of age and over)are at home in the daytime, but that most of these are occupied withhousehold duties in the mornings and v/ith miscellaneous activities(other than viewing and listening) in the afternoons.   Viewing figuresfor daytime television confirm this.21. Another BBC survey carried out in January 1967 into radio listeninghabits after midnight5) found that about two out of three people in thesample never listened after midnight.   Although about one third of thesample did listen between midnight and 12.30 a.m., only 5% of the samplewere found to listen frequently after that time.22. The TTA submitted as evidence in support of a demand for additionalhours figures derived from one of the Authority&apos;s regular surveys carriedout in November 1963.   The salient figures are set out below:Would like to see more television	Percentage			Total	Women	Housewives 16-34Mcsrairgs - Monday to Friday Saturday Mornings	21 3-7.5 24.5	20 43 21	25 54			25Sunday Mornings	37.6	34	34These figures were, in fact, submitted to the Post Office in a more extensive form some years ago.6) At that time the ITA interpreted themain percentages derived from the survey in terms of adult viewers who
would like to see more television as follows:Monday   -  Friday mornings 7,350,000Monday   -  Friday afternoons 13,250,000Saturday mornings 8,6C0,0003 unday mornings 13,2 50,COOWe were informed that the Post Office&apos;s Chief Statistician, to whomthe ITA figures were referred, took the view that, &quot;in the absenceof any information about the sampling arrangements the ITA had adopted, it was not practicable to assess the validity of theirresults from a statistical standpoint.   The mere statement that theywere based on a &apos;weighted sample of 3511&apos;  conveyed nothing of any value.&quot;   We are surprised that no steps were taken then, nor appearto have been taken since, to ascertain the adequacy or otherwise ofthe Authority&apos;s sampling arrangements.   Prima facie, from our knowledge of sampling techniques and of the fact that the ITA eaploysreputable outside market research organisations, we see no reason to regard these figures as more or less reliable than those deriving fromany similar sociometric survey.23. It is, of course, relevant to question the usefulness of this type of survey to ascertain intended, as distinct from actual,viewing habits.   As the Chief Statistician observed in the minute fromwhich we have already quoted   &quot;It was for consideration how far they(the results) were pertinent indicators of the demand&apos;1 for extendedviewing hours.   As framed, the questions had offered to intervieweesthe prospect of an additional facility without placing them under any obligation to make use of it, and without any implication of extra cost.   The fact that a material proportion were in favour was,therefore, hardly surprising;   but it threw no light on the crucialissue - to what extent the interviewees would make use of the newfacilities if they were available.   The best that could be said of   sthe enquiry was that it placed some sort of upper limit on demand.&quot; &apos;24, The sum total of these various pieces of evidence suggests thefollowing conclusions:(a) The filling of the present gaps in transmission on weekdaysat midday and in the afternoons     is likely to be welcomed,particularly by younger housewives, retired people and shiftworkers.(b) There may well also be some welcome for the extension of television  to about 12.30 a.m,(c) There is little indication that breakfast time televisionis high on the list of viewers1 priorities.(d) The extension of television in any of these three ways will serve quite small audiences only.25. V/e emphasise the tentative nature of these conclusions about thenature of the demand for additional hours.   As has been the case inthe past, we would expect demand for viewing during additional hours to be stimulated by supply.   But since broadcasters are at present free(with few restrictions) to position their transmissions at times thought to be most convenient to most of their viewers, and since audiencefigures during many of the hours at present in use are quite small, wewould not expect a rush by the broadcasters to use such additional hoursas may become available.   V/e return to the economic aspects of this consideration below. 8^
The Qualitative Arguments26. If it is true that the broadcasters cannot, owing to thelimitation of hours, provide as varied a service as they would like,the extension of the range of choices, both in terms of time, and ofsubject matter, made possible by extended hours would constitute avalid social argument for extended hours.   We therefore asked the broadcasting organisations what use they would seek to make of any additional hours that might become available.27. The BBC did not provide information on this point.   We were told that &quot;an extension of hours would be an opportunity for the BBC tofind new programme forms - but only if we had the resources to developthem,&quot;   Our attention was drawn to the fact that &quot;in the past, Ti/hennew hours have become available, the BBC has extended the range of television to use them to the best advantage.   The &apos;Tonight&apos; programme,in what was formerly the &quot;toddlers1 truce1 space, is only the mostmemorable example of this.&quot;28. In oral evidence, the BBC representatives took the view that inthe use of additional resources the BBC would be likely to give priority to the provision of &apos;area television&apos; and on the further improvement ofthe existing general services by the allocation of adequate finance to major projects such as the &apos;Great War1 series and the commissioning offilms by film makers of the first rank.29. The BBC also pointed out that they already provide programmes forminority groups and have undertaken commitments to Immigrant programmes,Farming and the Welsh language.   The placing of these, as well as of school and adult education programmes, &quot;at the best available timesduring the day and in the evenings adjacent to the general programmeschedule (would mean that) without a change of policy ... the BBCwould find itself unable to compete with ITV in programmes of generalappeal for a number of hours in the week, of which many would be at times when an important audience could be attracted.&quot;30. Without prejudging our discussion of the economic aspects v/eregard it as axiomatic that broadcasters, like everyone else, have tomate choices. Given the high cost nature of the television industry,v/e cannot foresee a time when the need for the making of choices will disappear. We note that the provision of additional programmes is lowon the list of the BBCs list of priorities at present. We considerthat the BBC should be free to make this choice; it does not follow,however, that this choice, even if 1right1 for the BBC, or for one ofthe BBC services is therefore &quot;right1 for all other services,31. In response to our question about the use of additional hours, theITA listed seven minority groups of viewers for whom programmes in thedaytime gaps might be provided:A.	housewives;ii.	children of pre-school age and children of all	ages during the holidays;iii.	shift workers and night workers;iv.	retired people;v.	the sick in hospital and at home;vi.	people on holiday or having a day off;vii.those unemployed or between jobs.
The ITA expressed the opinion that, given the snail audienceslikely to be available during any additional broadcasting hours,&quot;few of the programmes now normally shown in peak hours would receive firstin additional daytime transmissions;   first showings would be mainly confined to experimental prograi.imes.11   The Authority would, however,expect repeats of evening programmes, &quot;news bulletins, information and fiction programmes with some eye on the predominantly femaleaudience, programmes of an instructional nature, and programmes forthe younger child during the week and for older children at weekends.There might well be some use of feature films within the overall limitsimposed by the Authority.&quot;9)   At lunchtime there might, in addition,&quot;be some items of light entertainment to suit the mood of those at home or viewing communal sets during the lunch break.&quot;Here then we have two different sets of priorities.   In the caseof the ITAIs evidence it is, of course, important to bear in mind thefederal character of the system.   This tends to find expression inprogramme terms more extensively during the off-peak programme hours,when regional companies transmit programmes related to the interestsof their own audiences.   It appears to us likely that individualprogramme companies would use any additional daytime hours in widelydiffering ways in so far as their financial resources permitted.   Wethink they should be given the freedom to do so.On balance, therefore, we would expect the availability ofadditional hours to provide opportunities for the broadcasters to enhance the quality of the television services as a whole.The Protection of 1Parity1 of Hours.&apos;We now turn to the most difficult aspect of the socialconsiderations which must be borne in mind in any discussion of thehours rules.   This is the question whether, and if so to what extent,the Postmaster General should continue to intervene to ensure parity of transmission time between the broadcasting organisations.The Pilkington Committee asserted that it &quot;thought it right toconsider restriction (of hours) from the standpoint that the need for control must be proved, rather than   from the opposite standpoint thatthe need for relaxation of control must be proved.11^&apos;   But having made this important point it did not, in fact, indicate what proofs led it to&quot;recognise that, for television, competition in good broadcasting betweenthe BBC and the ITA cannot exist unless there is someone to &quot;hold thering1 in the matter of hours.   That person can only be the PostmasterGeneral.11&quot;&apos;We have identified in paragraphs 13-16 four respects in which theconditions in which the two organisations compete have changed since1961.   Indeed it could be argued that the pendulum has swung too far the other way, and that the facilities for complementary schedulingcreated by the opening of the BBC-2 service and the striking use made ofthe Corporations sound and vision services for cross-channel and cross-medium promotion of programmes gives it an inviolable advantage over theITV service.   These place the BBC and the ITA on a much more evenly balanced footing.   In addition, the BBC has proved in the intervening years that it can at least hold its own in the general programme field and that there is no reason why a service financed from licence revenueshould not share the audience equally with a service financed from advertising revenue.In view of these developments we find it difficult to understand why the Corporation appears to cling to a protectionist policy which was created to meet quite different circumstances. We were told &quot;that it isnecessary for the BBC broadly to match, on at least one of its networks,the transmission patterns of the commercial companies ... Although thereare some periods when transmissions are not totally matched anysubstantial category of transmission on one network has its counterpart
on the other.   If, therefore, commercial television is permitted tohave and decides to put on breakfast time transmissions,afternoon repeats, women&apos;s programmes, programmes for shift workersor late shows, the BBC would feel compelled to match them.   Theprincipal reason for this is that the BBC has to be a complete service.The BBCs audience is entitled to the whole range of television available at any given time;   their loyalty must not be undermined by the feeling that the BBC offers in any respect less than what is available from its competitors.&quot;39, We appreciate that both organisations have, in view of their duty to provide balanced national services containing education, information and entertainment, a large area ever which their programme patternsshould be similar.   In the words of the White Paper which we havealready quoted, they have &quot;a common objective of public service.&quot;   Theservice of this objective must be the constant preoccupation of thegoverning bodies of the two organisations.   But to argue from this thatall programme categories on one service should be matched on the otherseems to us to be fallacious, particularly when applied to the categories mentioned in the BBC&apos;s evidence.   Such total matching is notthe practice at present and we do not regard it as being in the viewers&apos;interests that it should be.   Within the broad limits of a general service, the more variety there is in the composition of the programmes,the greater the choice for the viewer,40. We are disturbed, moreover, by the suggestion that viewer &quot;loyalty1to a particular channel should be protected as a matter of public policy.   If there is social purpose in the provision of severaltelevision channels it is the provision of choice for the viewer, ofenhanced opportunity for him to exercise his discrimination, and the chance to broaden his horizon.   The competitive spirit of those incharge of different television channels very properly causes them tokeep a ulose eye on the output of their competitors.   But it is vital that they should at all times see their viewers as responsible peopleable to make their own choice rather than as captive audiences, whichmust at all costs be prevented from switching to another channel.Accordingly we reject this argument in favour of public protection ofparity,41, V/e believe that the broad principle of parity is now securedsufficiently by the common objectives set for the two organisationsby Parliament.   If nonetheless circumstances should arise which putin doubt the ability of the BBC to compete on equal terms with theindependent service, we think the proper means of restoring a measureof equilibrium would be the fiscal regulator referred to in paragraph15.   We do not think that elaborate   protection of general services is any longer required.42, One possible exception to this is a major departure which might bemade possible by an extension of hoursi   breakfast time news-magazineprogrammes.   We were told by the ITA that there is no sign that any ofthe companies wish to introduce such programmes, since they wouldinvolve additional shift working arrangements.   The BBC told us that theywould feel bound to match the introduction of breakfast time programmes.Current affairs programmes in the earlier part of the day could, moreover,affect the   impact and standing of similar programmes at main viewingtimes.   If it were thought that the BBC should be protected from the eventuality of breakfast time current affairs programmes on television,it would be possible so to formulate a prescription as to precludetelevision broadcasting at that time.   (It should, however, be noted thatthere is no such prescription at present).   Any arrangement of this kind would have to ensure that the BBC would remain free, as at present, to begin school programmes at 9.15 a,m. on occasion.
43, The Postmaster General&apos;s most positive means of intervention in the content of the broadcasting services is the exemption ofcertain classes of broadcast from the limitation on broadcasting hours.The fact that these exemptions are couched in negative terms does notdisguise the fact that, by them, successive governments have givenpositive encouragement to the promotion of certain types of programme.To this extent affirmations that &quot;Both the BBC and the ITA are public corporations, wholly responsible for the content of their programmes and for the day-to-day conduct of their affairs&quot;-^2&apos; are at present of limited validity.44. In the historical perspective this intervention by the PostmasterGeneral in the pattern of programmes can be seen to have been justified,even though it has constituted a contradictory element in the attitudeof government to the broadcasting organisations.   It is arguable that without such positive help from the Postmaster General the organisationsmight not have identified the implications of their statutoryresponsibilities.   There is no doubt that the existence of the exemptedcategories has relieved the governing bodies from the need to identifyfor themselves the implications of their public responsibilities inrelation to the minority programme categories concerned.   V/e were concerned to discover the extent to which, in oral evidence, the BSCrepresentatives claimed to rely on the &quot;closed period&quot; as a protection against the claiias of the programme controllers.   V/e were told, forinstance, that not even the governors themselves would be able tomaintain the religious &quot;slot&quot; against such pressure if this were nolonger protected by a government ruling, even without competition.45. V/e cannot believe that this would or should be the case.   If itwere, it would constitute a serious indictment of the whole system ofgovernment of the broadcasting services by responsible boards of governors.   V/e go further and argue that the governing bodies cannotbe expected to be fully responsible in the sense required by the charter of the BBC and the Television Act 1964 until they are given full responsibility for the whole range of the programme output without exception.46. The Postmaster General1s position in regard to the exempt categoriesis rendered doubly inconsistent by the fact that the coniaittees advisingon these categories of programme are accredited not to the PostmasterGeneral but to the broadcasting organisations.   In relation to religiousprogrammes the organisations are advised by the Central ReligiousAdvisory Council, appointed by the 3BC, which advises both theCorporation and the ITA.   In our enquiries on behalf of the PostmasterGeneral vie were unable to obtain the views of this Committee since itschairman, quite properly, took the view that it exists to advise the broadcasting organisations, not the Postmaster General.   similar considerations apply to the advice which the broadcasting organisationsobtain on school and further education programmes and, on the welsh language content of programmes, from the BBC&apos;s Broadcasting Council for wales and the ITA&apos;s Welsh Committee.   It cannot, in our view, make for good broadcasting for the Postmaster General to intervene in aspectsof the programme output on which the broadcasting organisations obtain their advice from third parties.Religious programmes evidence provided for us by the broadcasters indicates thatthe creation and maintenance of a strong body of religious programmesraises a number of conflicting considerations.   Understandably the churches appear to be anxious to maintain the present output which isquite substantial.   The broadcasters themselves are divided ,   In theviewer&apos;s interest most programme controllers take the view that the concentration of the bulk of religious programming into a single
70 minute block is undesirable.   The HA told us that 40-50 minutesmight, in terms of good religious programming, well be a betterlength at that time on Sunday.   From the point of view of thoseproducers responsible for securing adequate resources for religiousprogrammes on the other hand a 70 minute period stakes a larger claim for men and money than a shorter period.   Fortunately the recentdebate in the House of Lords provided an opportunity for the Bishopof Bristol, chairman of the Central Religious Advisory Committee, to disclose some of the grounds on which the Committee inclines to theview that the &quot;closed period&quot; defined in rule 3 of the Rules on Hoursshould be retained:   &quot;The production of adequate programmes in this or any other field depends upon competent producers being encouraged to develop their gifts with adequate resources of budget and adequatepromise of broadcasting hours.   So the provision of 70 minutes at agood time each Sunda^r has contributed substantially to ensuring thatreligious broadcasting attracts and retains trained and qualifiedproducers,&quot;-&quot;&apos;&apos;Again, in the battle for the allocation of good transmissiontimes for minority programmes, the BBC told us that the present fixed period was helpful.   If this control were lifted they thought thatcompetitive considerations would come into play and inevitablyreligion would be less well served than at present, and that &quot;religiousprogrammes could hardly hold their position if the restrictions were removed.&quot;   The existence of the closed period has clearly induced an element of inertia which relieves programme controllers of thenecessity of making decisions about this difficult area of broadcasting.There are, of course, also religious programmes outside theclosed period.   Both BBC-1 and Independent Television transmit areligious service or a similar devotional programme on Sunday mornings.There are late evening religious programmes on all channels.   The ITAtold us that the Sunday service ought not to be affected even ifSunday mornings were to be used for general programmes.   We hope thiswould be the case and that the Authority would stand by its duty inthis matter.We appreciate that it may be convenient for the broadcasters touse the Postmaster General as a shield, but we think that it is nowappropriate for the broadcasting organisations to grapple with these issues themselves,   A decision about the ways and means of securingadequate treatment of religious themes in the total programme patternbelongs firmly on the shoulders of the governing bodies of the broad-casting organisations.   The Postmaster General would therefore be fully justified in transferring this responsibility to them, making it clear that the co-ordination of the policies of the two broadcasting organisations would be a proper subject matter for discussion at themeeting of chairmen to which reference is made in paragraph 5C of the december 1966 White Paper.Educational programmes place of school broadcasting on both BBC-1 and ITV is by now so well established that we do not think that their position wouldbe endangered by a relaxation in the Hours Rules.   The TTA told us thatthe contracts of the programme contractors imposed on these an obligation to transmit in term time a minimum of 9 hours a week(including repeats) of school programmes.   This obligation is enforce-able by means of the Authority&apos;s statutory power to approve theprogramme schedules of individual companies.   The BBCs schoolprogrammes are provided under the aegis of the School BroadcastingCouncil of the United Kingdom.   This Council is unique among theCorporation^ councils and committees in having control of generalpolicy iii this area and responsibility for determining the scope and purpose of each programme series.   Having regard to these structuralsafeguards and noting that the use of school television programmes by
both primary and secondary schools has grown substantially in thelast few years, we would not expect either broadcasting organisation to neglect its responsibilities in this field.52, The position of further and adult education programmes is more complex, for three reasons.   In the first place, few of these programmes are transmitted into clearly-defined classroom situations.   They tendto be addressed to the viewer at home and their impact is accordinglymore difficult to measure.   Secondly, it is much harder in this category of programme to draw the border-line between programmes thatare clearly educational and those of a more generally educative type.Lastly, there has to be considered the possible effect on this areaof broadcasting of the contract recently entered into by the BBC withthe Open University for the production and transmission of theUniversity&apos;s broadcast programmes.   The Corporation^ commitment isfor eight 25-minute programmes a week in 1971 working up to nearly30 hours a week by 1975.   Initially the bulk of these programmes willbe transmitted on BBC-2.   The BBC assures us that it intends tocontinue its separate service in the field of further education,though there would naturally be close liaison to avoid duplication.53. The ITA recognises that there is an obligation on companies toprovide adult education programmes, although the contracts do notstipulate a minimum time for these as for school programmes.   TheAuthority takes the view that much of the existing adult educationmaterial would find its place in general programming if there were no restrictions.   It recognises, however, that it might be necessaryto prescribe the production of a certain number of programmes clearlyconforming to the formula in rule 3 (vii) of the Rules on Hours.   here again we would expect social considerations to cause both governingbodies to give particular attention to the maintenance and developmentof this sector of their responsibilities.Outside Broadcasts54. Neither broadcasting organisation objects in principle to theaggregation of the allowance for outside broadcasts with the general programme allowance^ assuming that the combined allowance were expressed in flexible terms.   The BBC fears, however, that if this were done, it &quot;would have the effect of opening the door to a wholesalereadjustment of transmission times.   Our competitors might think itprofitable to broadcast more at times when most viewers were concentrated,for instance at weekends rather than on weekdays, and in the winter ratherthan in the summer months.   If they did, the BBC might feel compelled, inorder to maintain its own relationship with its viewers, also to adjustits transmission times.&quot;   The ITA sees no such difficulty.   We are told that the present system requires cumbersome accounting machinery costing about  15,000 a year.   More important, the distinction between OB&apos;s andgeneral programmes induces unnecessary rigidity into programme planning.The combination of the two allowances would permit greater flexibility,for example on Saturday afternoons, when the present system effectivelylimits transmissions to outside broadcasts.Ministerial and Party Political Broadcasts55, Ministerial and party political broadcasts are also exempted from the Hours Rules at present.   We cannot conceive that the broadcast-ing organisations would neglect their duty to afford adequate air-timefor such broadcasts if the present restrictions were relaxed.   Clause14(3) of the Licence and Agreement made between the Postmaster Generaland the BBC, moreover, gives the Government of this day adequate powersto secure the transmission of ministerial announcements.   The PostmasterGeneral has similar powers under the Television Act 1964.
uui\irii)d\i t IAI12.Other Exempt Categories56, There remain broadcasts in the Welsh language and one or two other minor categories of exempted broadcast.   We would assume thatthe interest of viewers in Wales would be adequately represented tothe broadcasting organisations by their Welsh representative bodies.There should be little difficulty in ensuring adequate air time forthe other minor exempted groups of transmissions.57. A general point may be made in conclusion.   There appear to usto be strong arguments from the point of view of the professionalbroadcaster for giving the system greater flexibility in the allocation of their air times.   There would be more scope for experimentation;   wewould expect enhanced opportunities for the provision of more localtelevision broadcasting;   and with this the opportunity for the wideruse of available talent.   It might also be possible for the broadcasting organisations gradually to encourage more participation and discussion by the audience.   There is little doubt that the medium itself lias notbeen used to examine its own problems as much as might have been expected.D.     ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS58. We were also asked by the Postmaster General to take into accountrelevant economic considerations in the formulation of our advice onthe modification of the hours rules.   Here again the limitations placedon us have meant that we have had to rely on extant material, whethersubmitted to us by the General Post Office and the broadcasting organisations, or otherwise easily available.   In particular we have hadto &quot;take as read1 the cost effectiveness of the operations of the broadcasting organisations.   We have left out of account considerations of any internal improvement of procedure or economies of working whichmight free a portion of present resources although, clearly, thesecannot be ignored.59. In the case of the broadcasting organisations the use of any additional hours made available is conditional upon the necessaryadditional financial resources being available.   We asked the ITAwhether there was any scope for adding to the present hours oftransmission without a commensurate increase in advertising income.We were told that &quot;The Authority would not regard an extension of hoursas calling for any change in the existing rules about advertising.   Ifa change of the kind implied in the question were made a condition of grant of extra hours, the result would be that the progranane companies were precluded from earning advertising revenue to meet the costs incurred in providing additional programmes.&quot;   The 3BC told us   &quot;we accept in principle that broadcasters should have the right to broadcastat times and for durations of their own choosing.   The problems arethose of present practicability and finance ....   We then come up against the crucial fact that the BBC is not in a financial position toextend its transmissions.   We have said that it is our intention to makethe present licence fee last until well into the 1970*s.   On that basisour revenue is fully allocated to existing projects... Neither is itany solution that extra money might be forthcoming e.g, from intensifieddrives against licence fee evaders or even from an increased licence fee.There are other uses for any such revenue which can claim priority.&quot;   Wehave comnented on the relevance of this latter argument in paragraphs28-30 above.
What additional hours are at issue?60. In order to enable us to assess the financial disequilibriumwhich might result from the availability of additional hours, itis necessary to look more closely at the actual disposition of thehours at present available.   We have quoted in paragraph 5 theinformation about the actual hours of transmission supplied to us by the BBC and the ITA.   In Appendix A we show, for the weekKay 31st - June 6th the programme times as shown in the programmejournals and the internal gaps, in each case for both BBC-1 (North)and ITV (North-West).   The figures indicate that BBC-1 transmittedfor over 88 hours during the week, i,e. five hours or so longer thanthe March week quoted by the BBC;   ITV was on the air 78 hours, i.e.one hour longer than the figure for Central Scotland quoted by the HA.The disparity in these figures appears to be due mainly to the highincidence of long outside broadcasts during the summer, for cricket,tennis and similar events.   It serves to emphasise the importance inany proposed modification of the hours rules, of preserving the flexibility at present afforded by the expression of the outsidebroadcast allowance in terms of an annual figure,61. Appendix A also demonstrates the variations in the transmissiontimes of the two services.   BBC-1 on weekdays in term time regularlyopens about i5 hours before those of ITV.   BBC-1, again on weekdays,transmits between noon and 13.53, during most of which time 3TV isoff the air.   ITV tends to be on the air slightly longer than BBC-1in the late evening.   There are more short breaks of between 5 and12 minutes on BBC-1 than on ITV.   If these gaps are included, theinternal gaps in the BBC programme add up to 11.40 hours;   those inthe TIV schedule to 10,06 hours.   Excluding the short gaps, thefigures are much closers   10^20 hours for the BBC compared with 9.54hours for ITV.62. Patterns are not sufficiently regular to make it possible to identify substantial internal gaps regularly, except the ITV close-down between noon and about 13,40,   We would expect this space tobe one of the first to be filled, if opportunity occurred.   The BBC-1gaps during the week in question were concentrated on Thursday andFriday.   On each of these days there was a substantial gap betweenabout 11.30 and 13.00 and between 14.25 and 16.20.   If these gapsare averaged out over the week, it seems that something of the orderof another % hours per day might well enable both channels to dosome worthwhile programming in addition to what is already done inthe period between 13.00 - 16.30 hours.   Such a figure, i,e, 10.30hours weekly, corresponds in some measure to the more sizeable gapsadded up in the preceding paragraph.63. We know that such an addition constitutes only one half of the three dailyadditional hours which, the ITA told us, the programme companiesmight in the next 3-4 years want to use.   It does, however, emergethat if restrictions are to be lifted the closing of obvious gapswould be the logical beginning.The cost of additional hours.64. We asked the broadcasting organisations whether their capital equipment was likely to be adequate for the production of such additional programmes as they would like to produce.   The ITA told us that they would not expect it to &quot;be necessary to expand resourcesmore than marginally, if at all.   At present, Independent Televisionhas some surplus of productive capacity.   This is largely due to the changes in the contract pattern introduced last year, which have introduced a major centre of production in Leeds without a correspond-ing reduction in the previously existing studio centres.   There is also
GONFIDttUIAL14.some surplus production capacity in the regional companies.   Thegeneral surplus capacity is not confined to material resources;   itcomprises also creative resources.&quot;   It is likely that, since thisevidence was prepared, the surplus capacity has increased owing tothe rationalisation plans undertaken by the programme companies asa result of the increase in the rate of levy.   The BBC did not refer to this question in their replies.   Whatever- the situation may be atthe London Television Centre, it is reasonable to suppose, however,that there is some spare capacity at some of the regional BBCtelevision studioss65. But even though there may be spare capacity, it costs money to- use it.   Kow much, we have not been able to find out in any detail.The only figures which were supplied to us were those quoted by the bbc for the cost of repeats.   The Corporation^ views on the use ofrepeats were pessimistic.   &quot;It is tempting to assume&quot;, so they told us, &quot;that the solution would lie in repeats, but there are variouscomplications.   In the first place our programmes are not necessarilyavailable for repeat because of, for example, Union restrictions.Secondly, while some repeat programmes are cheap, others can be expensive - for example, if we were to repeat the 26 Forsyte Saga1programmes again, they would cost us  5,CCO per episode, a total of 130,000 ....   One hour a day of repeats which included a proportionof drama and entertainment would cost something like  500,000 to 750,000 a year.&quot;66. The ITA was less pessiEjistic, although it recognised that&quot;Repeats of drama involve very substantial additional payments underthe present agreements with the writers1 and artists&apos; unions, andthe companies would hope to be able to negotiate more favourablerates for day-time repeats.   If this proves possible, perhaps one half of an additional daily three hours of programmes would consistof repeats.&quot;   The exploration of the possibility of reduced ratesfor day-time repeats is one of the useful suggestions which has emerged from our enquiries.   We think that the broadcasters mightwell be encouraged to pursue this since it would benefit not onlythem, but also the performers and the viewers.67. Bearing in mind that, as the ITA told us, few of the presentpeak-time programmes (which tend to be especially expensive) wouldbe likely to receive first showings during additional day-time hours,we think it reasonable to apply the range of figures quoted by the bbc for repeats not only to these but to the possible on-cost of day-time programmes generally.   Taking an average on-cost of between 1500 and  2000 per hour, the annual cost of an hour a day would bearound  650,000.   We would therefore estimate an additional 1% hours a day to require about  1 million a year, assuming that a reasonable balance were kept between high and low cost programmes.68. An important point made to us by the ITA, which is relevant alsoto the BBC, is that additional hours would provide greater opportunitythan exists at present to give a wider showing to programmes produced .in the regions.   The Welsh programmes at present shown on BBC-1 atlunchtime are a good example of what can be done;   and it serves topoint one of the inconsistent consequences of the present rules thata regional programme in Welsh can be shown in London because it isexempt from the restriction on hours whereas a programme from scotland which happens to be in English cannot.   Given the opportunity,we have little doubt that the broadcasting organisations would findmuch regional material of interest which could, at little extra cost,be given a second showing on the network.
j  million increase  million1961	340	1962	349	91963	370	211964	412	421965	429	171966	439	101967	447	81968 (est)	482	35The share of these totals accounted for by television was  124 m. in1967 and is estimated at  133 in 1968.   This certainly does not suggestthat ITV would not be able to sustain the financial burden of additionalhours, even though the estimated growth rate shown for advertising as awhole in 1968 is thought, by the Advertising Association, to mask a slightly lower growth rate in television than in the press.The BBC is in a more difficult position.   Its revenue is, we areinformed, fully allocated to existing and potential projects.   We are assured that there is no room whatever for manoeuvre.   It seemsnecessary to examine these assertions in greater detail, in so far asthe material available to us permits.The first factor to be borne in mind is the increase of  1 in the combined radio and television licence from 1st January last.   This will bring in an additional  15 million or more each year.   The increase inthe colour licence from  10 to  11 will have a slower impact (see para-graph 76 below).The financial resources for additional hoursAs indicated in paragraph 59, the BBCs income is not proportionalto transmission time.   This makes it difficult for the Corporation to welcome additional hours.   It is generally assumed that independent television, on the other hand, would be happy to go all out to use all available additional hours because of the conmensurate increase in revenue.   But we have not found this to be the case.   Among the smallercompanies in particular, rising costs combined with the heavierincidence of the advertising levy, have recently caused policies whichwere already cautious to be reinforced.   The ITV regions, as indicated by the example of Central Scotland in paragraph 5, have always tended to transmit less.   The two shortest broadcasting weeks in ITV are thoseof Border (69 hours) and Channel (66 hours).   Although we were informed by the Authority that, in general, the programme companies would expect to earn sufficient additional advertising revenue after the first yearto cover the cost of three hours a day of additional programmes, these views are not shared by the smaller companies.   A spot check with oneof these suggests that this company would be unlikely to take advantageof any additional hours at the present time, since the cost involvedmight well not be recouped by advertising revenue.The evidence on this point suggests that although the fiscalregulator has been applied, its effect may have been uneven in so faras it appears to have weakened the weak and yet left the strongercompanies in a position where they can envisage expansion withoutqualms.     However, the estimated increase of 8% in advertisingexpenditure during 1968,14) if confirmed, shows an appreciable increase over the previous three years!Total Advertising Expenditure-^
Other increases in income are likely to accrue to the BBC from atleast four sources:   the increase in the number of sound and of combined sound and television licences, the growth in the number ofcolour licences, the growth of income from publishing and othertrading activities, and the reduction in the number of licence evaders.We consider first.the increase in the number of radio, and of combined radio and television licences.   Since national coverage of television is virtually complete, the scope for an increase of income from this source is likely to contract.   Population growth and the consequent increase in the number of homes, as well as the increase inthe number of homes with 2 or more receivers, will however contribute to some continuing growth in the number of combined radio and televisionlicences.   In the last five years the actual growth rate was as follows:16)Annual Increase in Number of Licences1963-4 442,5251964-5 367,7141965-6 314,0451966-7 700,1811967-8 800,808It is assumed by the Post Office, however, that the 1966-7 and 1967-8figures were inflated by the anti-evasion measures taken (see paragraph77 below).   This is borne out by the actual number of licences in force at the end of April, 1969, which had risen to only 15.4 million.   Afteronly four months of the operation of the increased licence fee it was difficult to apportion responsibility for the slackening of the growth rate between this factor, the lesser effectiveness of anti-evasionmeasures, and the saturation of the market.   In any case, Post Officeprojections for the next five years are much more modest:Expected Number of Combined sound and Television Licences	million1969-70	15.741970-1	15,841971-2	15.91972-3	15.951973-4	16.0Since upwards of the 15 million homes which are at present estimated to have television receivers account for 92% of the population, theslowing down of the rate of growth is inevitable.   Nonetheless it isto be expected that between 1968 and 1974 another  6 million or so will be added to the annual licence revenue, which can thus be expectedto reach at least  96 million during this period.The fall in the number of radio licences was in 1968 reversed forthe first time since 1950:   2,529,750 licences were sold compared with ,476,272 in 1967.   This reversal may well be due to the growingpopularity of car radios and transistor sets.   The actual figure for carradios included in radio-only licences at the end of April 1969 had risen to 1,014,000 from 956,029 on 31st March 1968.   Here again the substantial growth rates of 1967 and 1968 have not been sustained.   Butin view of a recorded rate of 5% or more per annum, the Post Officeprojection of 1% is perhaps unduly conservative.
76,   The growth in the number of colour licences.   Estimates vary widely.The latest Post Office estimates supplied to us envisage growth atthe following rate:Revenue from Colour Licences 0001968-9 (actual) 6301969-70 1,C0C1970-71 2,5001971-72 4,500We are informed by the Post Office that the BBC, in April 1960,estimated the cost of colour,/distinct from that of duplication ofthe VKF services in OIF, over the six year period from 1966-7 to beas follows:Cost of development of colour television ( s million)	Current	Papital	Total1966-7	0.1	1.1	1.21967-8	1.0	2.7	3.71968-9	2.1	4.4	6.51969-70	3.4	4.6	8,01970-71	4.9	2.6	7.81971-2	5.6	1.7	7.3Totals	17.1	17.4	34.5It is difficult at this stage to estimate when income will matchexpenditure, particularly since colour production costs will,presumably, become progressively assimilated to production costsgenerally.   If present trends are simply extrapolated, so the PostOffice tell us, colour licence revenue will match colour operatingexpenditure between 1972 and 1974j   and total colour expenditure between 1973 and 1975.   And although it will take some time, we thinkit important to bear in mind that, on the basis of 15 million televisio:licences, there is in the expansion of colour television, a reservoirof  75 m. a year;   a return on its investment which will accrue to the bbc more certainly than any return which investment in colour televisio:may bring to ITV.77.   We were told by the BBC that income from publications and othertrading activities was negligible.   We note that Television Enterprisesreported a gross income.from all activities at home and abroad during1968 of  1.5 million. V   This may be small by comparison with much ofthe Corporation^ other income, but we do not regard it as negligible.In the Income and Expenditure Account for the year ended 31.3.68 thesurplus on trading activities is shown as  945,314 compared with 607,386 the year before.18)   This increase of more than 50% in the trading surplus, deriving from an increase of more than 150% in the gross income of Television Enterprises, suggests that there is room for considerable development in income-earning capacity here.   Weunderstand that already TV Enterprises 1!has become one of britain slargest merchandising agents.   Apart from handling licences based onBBC-tv programmes it now deals with many for the U.3. and Europeanseries seen on BBCs two channels.   That outstanding success &apos;TheMagic Roundabout&apos; attracted more than 100 different licences, whilenewcomers such as &apos;The Herbs&apos;, &quot;Basil Brush1 and &apos;IIector1s House&apos;showed great potential for the future.&quot; 19)75.  Revenue from, publications at  1,592,783 v/as in 1968 about 50% higherthan in 1967, but somewhat lower than in 1964 ( 1,646,433).20)Here again is a source of income directly and properly related to theCorporation^ broadcasting activities which, while not large, is by nomeans insignificant.
Under the terms of the Wireless Telegraphy Act (1967) televisiondealers are required to notify the Post Office every time a televisionset is sold.   This has already had an effect in reducing the numberof licence evaders.   It is estimated, however, that 1% millionevaders remain and that some  7,5 million of licence fees a year remain to be collected.   Although it will not, presumably, be possible to achieve 100% success in view of the high degree of geographicalmobility of the population and the progressive increase in the cost of collection, we think it reasonable for the BBC to expect the majorportion of television licence revenue to become increasingly available.It should, moreover, be worthwhile pursuing a similar policy inrelation to sound-only licences, particularly since it is estimatedthat among car radio users alone some 2 millions do not buy a licenceat present.In the light of these potential sources of additional income andof the estimated cost of additional transmissions, we find it difficultto accept the flat statement that &quot;the BBC is not in a financial positionto extend its transmissions&quot;.   As we have pointed out before, theCorporation may well not want to do so   and,like the ITV companiesunwilling to extend transmissions, should have the freedom to decideits own priorities.   These seem to us to be essentially decisions which should be made by the broadcasting organisations as long as thePostmaster General is content that the basis of competition is reasonably fair.   From the evidence at our disposal we are inclined to think that, in economic terms, the scales are a good deal moreevenly balanced than would at first sight appear to be the case.Increase in Licence fee. Consumer Spendingand Public Sector InvestmentWe return briefly to the assumptions v/ith which we began ourinvestigation and which are set out in paragraph 4.   The first ofthese was that there would be no increase in the licence fee in the foreseeable future.   The evidence so far does not lead us to suppose that the BBC would be unable, if it wished to do so, to sustain some additional hours on BBC-1 without an increase in the licence fee.We also proceeded on the assumption tliat the Government will, forsome time to come, be anxious not to encourage consumer spending,   weconclude from our study that an increase in encouragement to consumerspending would arise as a by-product of any additional broadcasting hours which may be granted and used.   On the assumption of the use oflj additional hours daily some 9 minutes a day at off-peak times wouldbecome available for sale to advertisers.   We would regard this additional advertising space as being likely to have a good deal lesseffect on consumer spending than other decisions taken by the Government,such as the introduction of colour television, which is bound to havethe effect of rendering prematurely obsolete very large numbers of television receivers and of encouraging the spending of 15,000,000 x 3c1, i.e. a sum of the order of  4,500 million in the next ten years.We note that Mr. Curran, in a recent speech, suggested that thepresent restrictions on hire purchase and set renting should be eased. Thisencourage consumer spending on colour receivers.The third of our assumptions was that the Government was anxiousto avoid increases in expenditure on capital investment in the public sector of which the broadcasting organisations form part.   V/e pointout in paragraph 64 that there is spare production capacity inIndependent Television, and that we believe there to be spare production capacity in the BBC, particularly in the Regions.   Thus there is no need, as a consequence of the modification of the Rules on Hours, to envisage additional capital investment.
The Fourth Channel34, We have proceeded on the assumption that a fourth televisionchannel will not be opened in the near future.   We are aware thatthe White Paper of December 1966 stated that &quot;the Government havedecided that no allocation of frequencies to a fourth channel willbe authorised for the next three years at any rate,&quot;21/   This periodexpires in December next and the Government may well wish to reopen the matter.   Whatever the decision may be, there seems no reason to defer action on the modification of the hours rules on this account.Even if an additional channel were to open, it would, like BBC-2,take some years to build up its volume of production.   Its possiblehours of transmission would be well within those of BBC-1 and HV.The major issue, that of parity between the two dominant services,would not therefore be affected.Other Economic Considerations85. We have so far been concerned to assess the BBCs opportunities of increasing its income during the next few years.   It is appropriate to look briefly at the choices which are open to the BBC or to theGovernment by way of easing the Corporation^ financial burden overthe next few years,86- We understand that the BBCs: bill for Selective Employment Taxwill be of the order of  2,250,000 a year and that the previousDirector General undertook to absorb this sum within the normal budget.We have some sympathy with the newspaper article which has recentlyargued that &quot;if the film industry is exempt from the tax on the grounds that it manufactures film, why can&apos;t the production of sound and visiontapes be regarded in the same way?&quot;22;   The remission of even part ofS.E.T. would give the Corporation an element of elbow room.87. The BBCs policy of paying for all capital investment out ofrevenue is another factor making for unnecessary difficulty at times of exceptional capital expenditure.   The traditional argument that theCorporation^ capital investment does not produce an increased returndoes not apply to the development of colour, as we have indicated inparagraph 76.   The Corporation^ substantial borrowing powers could properly, in our view, be used to spread the capital burden imposed bythe introduction of colour at a time when the need to duplicate theVHP service and expand BBC-2 is also making heavy demands on the corporations resources.88, Cur terms of reference do not require us to extend our enquiriesand recommendations beyond the television services.   We do not coonent,therefore, on the matters affecting the scale and content of the bBCssound radio services which are currently under discussion.   We merelyrecord the obvious:   that the financial condition of the corporation is determined by the income/expenditure equation of both sound andvision services, and that these are interdependent.
E.     STRUCTURAL COLORATIONS89, We were not specifically asked to take structural considerationsinto account in our study of the Rules on Hours.   These considerations were, however, forced on our attention by the nature of some questionswe had to ask ourselves&apos; viz, What are the purposes of the variousrules at present in force?   Who is responsible (and accountable) for meeting these purposes?  What are the means of relating policy decisions in protected programme areas to the needs of their audiences?90, The Postmaster General is responsible to Parliament for themaintenance of a national broadcasting system outside the range ofpolitical influence and conducted in the public interest.   Within this general responsibility the governing bodies of the broadcasting organisations have, to quote the current BBC Handbook, &quot;undividedresponsibility for the conduct of programmes&quot;j23)they are &quot;whollyresponsible for the content of programmes and for the day-to-dayconduct of their affairs.u%&amp;)   There can be little doubt that thehours rules, as they at present stand, circumscribe administrativelythe power and the responsibility which Parliament intends thegoverning bodies to exercise.91. This we believe to be unsound in principle and wasteful Inpractice.   Nor does it appear to us to be arguable that thoseprogramme groups which are exempted under the current rules are somuch more important than other groups, such as news, current affairs or children&apos;s programmes that for these the Postmaster General must take responsibility direct.   If this were so, Parliament would havelegislated differently and the powers and responsibilities of thegoverning bodies would not have been drav/n as widely as is the case.We recall the relevant passages in the Pilkington Report:   &quot;theGovernors1 and Members&apos; concern is to represent and secure the publicinterest in broadcasting.   It is for them to judge what the\publicinterest is and it is for this that they are answerable.&quot;        Thusthey are the guardians of the public interest in relation to their services.   If the governing bodies do not secure the public interest,the fault lies with them.   The Postmaster General&apos;s remedy is to call the governors to account, individually and corporately, for theirstewardship, rather than to take over their duties and responsibilities.92, But it may be, and indeed has been, argued that there is nothingwrong with the governors except that they cannot assert themselvesover the officials.   Here again the Pilkington Committee was quite clear (and, in this, it followed closely the line of argument takenby the Beveridge Committee).   It said that the governing bodies mustnot judge the public interest &quot;by assessing the balance of opinion onthis or that element of programme content, and then adopting themajority view as their own; ... their task is ... to be thoroughlyaware of public opinion in all its variety, to care about it and totake proper and full account of it.   Having done so, they must thenidentify the public interest in broadcasting ... and secure it throughcontrol of the executive arm, &quot;2$)   V/e recognise that, in bothorganisations, control of the executive arm is no easy matter for part-time governors.   Neither the BBC nor the HA officials satisfiedus that the evidence of their organisations on the possiblemodification of the hours rules had actually been considered and approved by the governing bodies.   The BBC representatives told us that Mr. Curran&apos;s letter of 24th April to Mr. Wood &apos;had been seen bythe chairman of the governors1,   V/e have already quoted the opinionexpressed by one official    that    even discounting competition, the governors (of the BBC) were unlikely to be able to maintain the 1closedperiod1 if this were not protected by the Postmaster General.
93. If there is a weakness in the present system of control, itappears to us to be here.   And if the hours rules merely serve tomask a deficiency in the ability of the governing bodies to ensurethe service of the public interest, then there may be good reasonfor removing this prop and letting the deficiency be seen for what it is before the next enquiry into broadcasting policy takes place.Cur own expectation is that, whatever the historical position mayhave been, the governing bodies will be found capable of fulfillingtheir trust in the areas at present covered by the hours rules, as inthe other programme areas for which they already take full responsibility.   This may make necessary some adjustment in thebalance of power between the governors and the executive arm;   but such an adjustment would constitute/more than compliance with the relationship laid down in the Charter and Statute.94. The officers of the Post Office, at our request, made a briefsurvey of the position in other countries.   From the material whichthey collected it appears that, in most of these, the decisions aboutthe hours of broadcasting are, within wide limits, made by the broadcasting organisations themselves.   This is the case not only in countries without competing services, but also in countries likeGermany and Japan where publicly financed services compete withservices wholly or partly financed from advertising revenue.95. Quite apart from the social and economic considerations, thegoverning bodies have more effective machinery for identifying thepublic interest than is at the disposal of the Postmaster General:their advisory councils and committees.   If these and the otheraudience research facilities are insufficient, the governing bodies are free to improve them, and we would expect them to do so, possibly by the greater use of participative programmes.96. Among the shibboleths which tend to be advanced against thegeneral trend of our recommendations are the following:i. that when it comes to a conflict between &quot;good broadcasting&quot;and effective competition, good broadcasting usually loses,whatever the statutory obligations of the broadcastingorganisation;ii. that, whatever the formal power structure, the permanent staff are bound to carry more weight in practice than thegoverning bodies;iii. that, in Independent Television in particular, theAuthority is unwilling to use its statutory powers tocontrol the programme companies;iv. that the only objective of all programme contractorsis to maximise their profits;v. that in the allocation of peak transmission times programmecontrollers invariably decide in favour of safe majorityaudience programmes.vi. that competition inevitably forces the BBC to follow any and every trend in Independent Television.97* T&apos;/e should be sorry if these assertions, all of which are half-truths and most of which are reinforced by the structural weaknessto which we have drawn attention, \ieve allowed to detract from the weight of our recommendations. As we indicate, it is not naivete&apos;which has informed us: quite the contrary, lie are aware that theseemingly minor and simple matter of the modification of the hoursrules contains within it the major question of the actual point of
control in broadcasting in this country.   It concerns the capacity and willingness of the broadcasting governors to maintain the publicinterest not only in their own organisations, but also in the irrelations with each other.   Unless their authority can be assured,it nay be best to admit the failure of the present system.   We thinkthat the system should be put to the test and that the present time,marking the half-way stage between one broadcasting review and another,is appropriate for such a test.   It allows a reasonable period for theeffects of devolution of control to become apparent and to be takeninto account in whatever arrangements may be made for the review of broadcasting policy before 1976*   We are confident that the modestrelaxation proposed in this study will point the way to the entiredevolution of control over television broadcasting hours to thegoverning bodies of the broadcasting organisations in due course.F.     COMXiEIOIS and ISCCI^iBrDATIOfSThe 4eraand for more television hours (paras. 19-25)We have not, within the limits of our enquiry, found any strong demand for additional hours of television broadcasting.   3uchevidence as came to our notice suggests that quite small audiencesmight well take advantage of transmissions at lunclrtime and in theearly afternoon, and for a limited period in the late evening.We have not become aware of any overt demand for television inthe early morning,V/e note, however, that demand is, to some extent, a function ofsupply and that demand might well increase if programmes of interestwere provided at the tines of day at present not covered,V/e conclude that the absence of overt demand, coupled withthe period of financial stringency into which both broad-casting organisations have moved, are likely to limit theactual use which the broadcasting organisations make of any additional hours which may be made available,^ejiiili^Q6-3.3,.,to supply moretelevision hours (paras. 2,6-34 and 53-59)The BBC has made it clear that it does net, within its present financial arrangements, wish to provide more television hours.   TheHA informs us that it believes the programme contractors would bev/illing to use up to three additional hours per day within the next three to four years.   Our own enquiries suggest that the smallercontractors at least are unlikely to make substantial use of any additional hours which may become available.II.   We conclude that neither broadcasting organisation is likelyto make use of a major extension of television broadcasting hours in the next few years, and that it is thereforeunnecessary to regulate the number of hours on the assumptionthat the whole allocation will inevitably be used.The maintenance of parity of hours(paras. 35-43 and para. 80)We note that there is not, at present, parity of actual hours oftransmission.   Depending on outside broadcasts and the use of theexempted categories, differences in effective broadcasting time betweenBBC-1 and ITV may be as large as 10 hours a week.
103. ^e no-te also that the relative financial positions of the broadcasting organisations have been brought much nearer by the increases in the fees for combined radio and television licences and for colour television licences on the one hand, and the fiscalmeasures reducing the net income of the EV contractors on the other,III, We conclude that it is no longer necessary to prescribeexact parity of general programme hours and outsidebroadcast hours.   We think that variation of up to two hours a day can be sustained without detriment to the competitive character of either BBC-1. or HV.V/e recommendA. that the Postmaster General should, however, continueto limit the scale of variation in the number of hoursby setting an upper limit to the number of broadcasting hours;b. that he should, further, contain competition by settinglimits to the television broadcasting day in a mannersimilar to the limits for sound broadcasting.The Quantity of Hours (paras. 5 and 60-63)104, ffc note that the current 3BC-1 transmission times were given   tous as about 83 hours a week and ITV transmission times as varyingbetween 74 and 77 hours a week (except for the smaller contractorswhose transmission hours are less).105, V/e note also that ITV contractors have a contractual obligationto provide not less than 7 hours of programmes per day.106, V/e note that the hours of transmission for BBC-2 are well within those of BBC-1 and are for financial reasons likely to remainso for some time.IV. &quot;v/e conclude a. that some variation in the actual hours of broadcastingis compatible with the maintenance of a general levelof parity between B3C-1 and ITV,b. that, on grounds of flexibility of programming as wellas on structural grounds, responsibility for the disposition of all broadcasting hours should now be taken over by thegoverning bodies of the broadcasting organisations.c. that the availability of an average of up to 91 hours aweek of television broadcasting would. enable ITV to extend its actual broadcasting hours by up to two hours a day;ii. enable the BBC to extend its actual broadcasting hours by just over 1 hour a day;iii. enable some of the gaps in the present television broadcasting day to be filled;itv keep the financial implications of the modificationof the hours rules with in reasonable limits;v. not create an undue imbalance between the two broad-casting organisations if only one of them should decide to use the additional broadcasting hours.

(THIS DOCUMENT, IS THE PROPERTY OF HBR BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)B(69) 8 COPY NO.    I J jgQth July. 1969.cabinet ministerial COMMITTEE ON BROADCASTINGLOCAL RADIO:    THE constitution and ORGANISATION OF A GENERAL service memorandum by the Postmaster general.     Paragraph hi of our White Paper on Broadcasting (Cmnd. 3169)reserves until the conclusion of the experiment the question how a permanent and general service should be constituted, organised andby whom provided; and adds:&quot;The decision that the BBC should conduct the experimentimplies no commitment that the Corporation should provide a permanentservice, if it were decided to authorise one&quot;.2.     As local radio, however provided and financed, would be apublic service, it would be entrusted to one or more public authorities.   For the foreseeable future, there would be scope for only a one-channel service (marginal overlapping ignored)   perarea served.   Consequently, the choice lies between vesting authorityeither in local radio authorities, one for each separate area served,and each independent of the other; or in a single national authority.3.     The argument for local radio authorities is that the stationsthemselves would be local; and that control by a national authority might lead to programmes which did not sufficiently match theparticular interests and characteristics of the places served.In our White Paper (paragraph 39) we attached great importance tothe need to secure that the stations were local in character andnot all moulded to a common pattern imposed from the centre.   In theevent, the experiment has shown that a service in the charge of anational authority can be genuinely local in character.   That being so, the arguments against local radio authorities are, I believe,compelling.   These are: first, that it would be much easier tocoordinate frequency planning with, and ensure the efficient use of frequencies by, a few bodies of great technlrcal competencethan if a multiplicity of small authorities are oatabli^ho-d;   and.secondly, that the maintenance of high standards and in particular- 1 -
of impartiality in the presentation of public controversy is more likely to be secured through a national authority.   It was forthese reasons that we opposed the GLC&apos;s Bill providing for theestablishment by them of a local radio authority for the london area.   I conclude that there should be no departure from the policypursued by successive Governments, and that the provision of a service of local radio should, like the present broadcasting services, be entrusted to a public corporation at national level,answerable to Parliament and subject to certain reserve powers ofGovernment.U.     For the experimental service, the local broadcasting councilsappointed by my predecessor have proved their value in providing thestation manager with guidance and support in relation to programmepolicy and content; and in giving the community served by eachstation a direct say in its affairs while leaving editorialresponsibility - and liability - with the BBC.   A national authority should, I suggest, be required to work with similar localbroadcasting councils.5.     Next, should a new public corporation be established toprovide a local radio service; or should it be entrusted to oneof the two existing corporations?   As my colleagues will recognise,unless the service were to be financed by the sale of advertisingtime the choice would in fact lie between a new corporation andthe BBC.   The ITA could not reasonably be expected to provide a service, the success of which would tend to reduce the size of theaudiences of its television services and thus their revenue, whileearning no advertising revenue itself*   Also, the ITA areprecluded by Section 2(5) of the Television Act 196k   frombroadcasting in sound only, so that legislation would be necessary before the Authority could provide a service of local radio.6.    Legislation would also be necessary in order to incorporateand vest with rights and duties a new public corporation.   such legislation would be highly controversial; and we would, I suggest,need to be persuaded that a clear balance of advantage lay withthis course before accepting the difficulty and delay that it would entail.   The considerations are these:(i)    it would end the BBC&apos;s monopoly of sound broadcasting.Some would regard this as desirable on grounds of principle.On the other hand(ii) competition between national and genuinely local services would not, as competition between unlikes, be verymeaningful; and(iii)    the BBC&apos;s national services and recorded material wouldnot be available as sustaining material to a competitor - a fact which would add greatly to the cost of the service;- 2
(iv)    the BBC&apos;s resources of technical know-how and skillwould not be available to another organisation; nor would itseditorial experience and expertise to station managers liableto local pressures of all kinds;(v)    a new authority would have to be funded from publicrevenue;(vi)    if the service Is to be financed in any measure fromlicence revenue, the allocation of part of it to a public authority other than the BBC would add greatly to our difficulties.   We should be taking money away from the BBCin order that a competitor could provide a service at greatercost than the BBC.I conclude that,  if a service is to be authorised, it shouldbe provided by the BBC.7.     The Local Broadcasting Councils: for the purposes of the experiment the eight Councils of up to twenty members eachwere appointed by the Postmaster General in consultation with the bbc (Cmndo 3169, paragraph 39).    But we have now to reckon with,ultimately, forty or more stations,  and thus with some 800appointments lasting for, say, three years.   There are two ways in which these appointments might be made:(i)   by local authorities.    Since the stations would broadcastacross existing local boundaries, it would be necessary forthe purpose of making appointments to group local authoritiesinto joint boards which might co-opt other members fromprominent local organisations.   But this would weight the localbroadcasting councils too heavily with representatives from local authorities who would have little time to listen to the programmes.    There would be the danger that local politicalbattles would be carried into the councils, possibly even tothe point where the ruling party might seek to influence theeditorial policy of the station.    Outspoken criticism andcomment about the Town Hall might be at risk.   Also, it wouldbe represented by the Mary Whitehouse faction as admitting,their case for setting up a separate watch-dog organisation to supervise broadcasting;(ii)   by the BBC.    The criticism here would be that thelocal broadcasting councils would be the Corporation^creatures.8.   I conclude that the most satisfactory procedure would be forthe Minister to appoint the members of the local broadcasting councils from nominations produced by the BBC after consultationwith specified   local government bodies and other local interests.   The BBC should also draw up for my consideration astatement defining the role of the local broadcasting councils;and recording the principles under which they will operate.- 3 -
9,     conclusion invite my colleagues to agree that, providing a satisfactory method of finance can he found,  I should authorise the BBC toextend the service of local radio, and appoint local broadcasting councils, on the lines described above,,J o T a S .General Post Office,St. Mart:!::.&apos; s-le-Grand,E o C o 1 e9th July, 1969.- U -
THIS-DOCUMENT-I^-T^^PRO^RTY OF HSR BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)B(69). 9 COPY NO.    ^ I k10th July, 1969.&quot; cabinet ministerial COMMITTEE ON BROADCASTINGLOCAL RADIO - THE BBC&apos;S PROPOSALSMemorandum by the Postmaster general.     The BBC have put to me their own proposals for providing ageneral service of local radio in the future.   The main features of them are:-(i)   location: for England, forty stations covering quitelarge areas are proposed.   A lower priority would be given to scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland;(ii)    timetable: including existing stations, twenty would bein service by late 1970: thirty-three by 1574: the rest by1975;(iii)   frequencies: VHF  would give night and day service, butby day there would be medium-wave back-up, if we agree to release medium waves;(iv)    local programme output: about 6 hours a day;(v)    local broadcasting councils: would continue, and wouldhave a say in senior appointments;(vi)    cost: capital costs would be  UX),0O0- 65,0O0 perstation, operating costs rising to  100,000- 120,000 a yearper station.I describe these features in more detail below.LOCATION2.     england the BBC propose forty local stations.   These would have alarger coverage area than most of the present local stations.   Somewould cover larger conurbations like the present station at
Merseyside; others would he based on a &quot;county&quot; town and cover the surrounding suburban and rural areas.    The number of stations to serve London would depend partly on technical considerations which have yet to be examined in detail.   Whether or not forprogramming reasons one local service would be right for the wholeof London, for technical reasons it might be necessary to provide more than one transmitter.   The BBC consider there might be one service initially, with possibly up to four later.   The BBC estimate that the forty stations would provide 90% of the population ofEngland with local radio by day and by night on VHF.   Details ofthe BBC&apos;s plan are annexed.3,     The BBC prefer this pattern to the alternative of 150 or so&quot;town radio&quot; stations, each with a very limited range andserving a clearly defined urban community, on the model of, say,BBC Radio Brighton.   The latter pattern would in due course leadto annual expenditure of between  12m and  15m which the BBC do notthink would be feasible.    I agree.   Also, the BBC&apos;s plan is closer to Maud&apos;s conception.U.    Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland - would, unlike England,retain their national radio programmes, and so would not commandso high a priority in the development of local radio.    There wouldprobably be no need for local radio in Northern Ireland where thepresent service is based on the only large town, Belfast; but the bbc recognise that the largest conurbations in Scotland and wales would be likely to want their own stations.TIMETABLE5.     The BBC estimate that, given a decision before the recess,they could open twelve more stations in the major centres of population, including London, before the autumn of 1970 9FREQUENCIES6.    The BBC propose to provide the service on very high frequencies(VHF) and with a capacity for stereophony.    (Although for financial reasons not very many local programmes would be in stereo, local radio is far the cheapest way of satisfying the demand for morestereo from a vocal minority of enthusiasts.)   Only on VHF can ageneral service be provided both by day and night.   However, asonly just over a third of homes are equipped to receive VHF,the Corporation propose to back the VHF transmissions with a service on medium waves during   daylight hours.   After dark,a medium-wave service would be subject to interference.   Medium-wave&apos;back-up, the BBC consider, would bring local radio to a largeraudience immediately and by whetting their appetite for local radio,encourage them to buy VHF sets.   In the long term, we shall need tomake increasing use of VHF , so this is the right strategy.   Itwould also inhibit the cession of medium wavelengths to commercialoperators at a future date.   It does mean, however, that at times- 2 -
when the local station is relaying one of the BBCs nationalprogrammes, it might be available on four wave-lengths, twonational and two local.   For example, within the service area ofa given local radio station, Radio 2, would, when used as thesustaining programme, be available on four frequencies: the longwave, the VHF national transmission, the VHF local transmissionand the medium wave back-up of the local transmission.   As thingsstand in the experimental service, Radio 2 could be available onthe first three.    Though   the experimental arrangements, limitedas they are, have not attracted criticism on this score, back-upon medium wave might be represented by the commercial lobby as anextravagant use of frequencies.   In view of the line we have previously taken on the use of medium wavelengths for local radio,this duplication could be difficult to defend politically.   Butwe could say that the circumstances have changed fundamentallysince the BBCr&apos;s proposals would release some medium wavelengths,7,    Essentially, the bbc s plan relies upon VHF transmission.The possibility of medium wave back-up is a frill; and depends on the acceptability of the proposals, made in the context ofrestructuring the national radio services, for releasing mediumwavelengths.   My advisers tell me that although the objective of providing twelve additional VHF stations in the right placeswithin twelve months of so of our decision would not be withoutits difficulties - it would be a crash programme. - it is capable of achievement.   However, for the purposes of this programme, stereo would have to be forgone for the time being.But twenty VHF stations serving the major areas of population would be in operation by the end of 1970 (see Annex),LOCAL PROGRAMME OUTPUT8,    The BBC propose to broadcast some five to six hours of locallyproduced material a day from each station,.    This might be increased if finance is forthcoming locally.    It would be difficult toproduce many local educational programmes without help in cash orkind from the local authorities; but the BBC believe they would get it, even in areas where the councils are strongly backingcommercial radio.LOCAL BROADCASTING COUNCILS9o    The BBC attach great importance to the role of a council oflocal people in guiding and assisting the station manager and suggest that the Chairman of the Council should attend the selectionboards for senior station staff,    I would expect them to complywith the proposals outlined in my memorandum B(69)8 paragraph 8.COST10,   The BBC estimate the capital cost of the stations at 1+0,000-565,000 each.   The capital cost of the eight experimentalstations was  35,000 each,    I understand the BBC were able to buy the transmitters for the experimental stations very cheaply.   Thenew stations would cost more both because the transmitters wouldhave to. cover a wider area and because more sophisticated trans-mitters will reduce maintenance costs.   Moreover costs have risenin the last two years.   In addition, with the larger area, each- 3 -
station would need two radio cars.    The present operating costs are  65.000- 70,000 a year.   The BBC estimate that in futureoperating costs would &quot;be between  80,000 and  100,000 a year,rising to  100,000- 120,000 by the mid-70s.   The present stations are run on the minimum of staff (18-21 including engineers andtypists) who have worked exceptionally long hours to mate the experiment a success. . This cannot continue.   Stations broadcastingto larger areas would need more staff, especially for local newscoverage.    In all, the BBC would need a total revenue of  15.5mover the next five years to expand local radio on the scale theyenvisage.CONCLUSION11,   The main considerations which, I suggest&apos;, my colleaguen will wish to weigh are:(i)   whether the proposed distribution of the stations is acceptable;(ii) whether the timetable is acceptable. On this, my own view is that it provides an excellent chance of forestallingthe plans of the commercial lobby;(iii)   whether the stations should be primarily on VHF  butbacked by medium waves.   My own view is that we should acceptVHP; but, while recognising its attractions, reserve forfurther consideration the mediunMvave proposal;(iv) whether the proposed amount of local programme output is sufficient.It seems to me an acceptable compromise between supply ofmaterial and likely financial limitations.Subject to finance,  and to the other qualifications I have indicated above, my view is that the BBC^s plan should beauthorised.J a T .

t (THIS,DQCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER i BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT)B(69)10 COPY NO.     \ \ j10th July. 1969.cabinet ministerial COMMITTEE ON BROADCASTINGFINANCING A BBC LOCAL RADIO service memorandum by the Postmaster general.     B(69)8 records my belief that, if a satisfactory meansof finance could be found, the BBC should be authorised toundertake a general service of local radio.    If so authorised,the Corporation would intend to bring forty stations into service by 1975. thirty-three of them by March 197k-   The totalaggregate expenditure, including capital, would by March 1974amount to  15.5m.   The purpose of the present memorandum is toconsider methods of finding this money.2.     My colleagues will want to set it in the more generalcontext.   Apart from the savings (which I do not think we would wish to challenge) consequent on McKinsey&apos;s, the biggest singleeconomy proposed by the BBC is the reduction in orchestras.   on present trends, BBC radio, excluding local radio, will go intothe red by  6.5 million by March 1974.   Annual costs are rising at per cent. Since virtually every household receives the broadcasting services, the number of licences can only be expectedto rise to the extent that the number of households increases ar-d.-,additionally, to the extent that evasion is cut back.   We have tomake a choice.   Either the BBC must be put in sufficient funds.Or they must economise.3.     To return to local radio, advertising having been rejected as recently as last July (FB(68) 1st meeting), we are left with:(i)	the licence fee;(ii)	a mandatory rate;(iii)	direct Government subvention;(iv)	voluntary local contributions;(v)	limited sponsorshipor, of course, a combination of two or more of these methods.- 1 -
k*    The BBC to finance local radio from present licence revenueThe BBC tell me that this would require them to cut nationalradio to three networks by day and perhaps two in the evening,freeing many wavelengths for possible future exploitation by commercial interests.   Cuts on such a scale - far more drasticthan the economies they already envisage for national radio -would, they believe, be totally unacceptable to the listener.I agree,5*    An increase in the present feeA straight 5s. Od. increase in the combined,  and radio only,licence fees from 1st April 1970 would provide about an estimated 19m. additional revenue over the period ending March 1974*   Thiswould be enough to pay for local radio and if the BB^s proposedeconomies in patronage are all proceeded with, keep radio in the black for a few months after March 1974.   A six shilling increase would remove the financial need for the cuts in orchestras as wellBut there are difficulties in a licence fee increase to pay for local radio:(i)   The fee is regressive.   On the other hand fiveshillings extra a year - just over a penny a week - is verylittle; and thcragh it will provoke a temporary storm, at 6. 5. Od. the combined te^kevision and radio licence feewould still compare favourably with that of almost any country in Western Europe; while the radio-only fee, at30s. Od. would be only 10s. Od. more than it was in 1946.In real terms it would be about the same, if not less;(ii)   Some people in remoter areas would have to pay the extra licence fee for local radio but would never be ableto receive it.   So ideally, as we said in the 1966 White Papea local station&apos;s income should &quot;derive so far as is possiblefor local sources and not from a general licence fee&quot;(Cmnd. 3169, paragraph 41).   But we did not take   an absoluteview; and the argument loses most of its force against the bbc plan to bring local radio within five years to almostninety per cent of the population, and not necessarilystopping there.   This is noticeably better than Radio l&apos;scoverage, especially at night (33 per cent now and even onthe BBC!s plan for improving ita reception no more than45 per cent); and every licence-payer pays for Radio 1.There being this essential change in the facts, we would haveno   difficulty in rebutting a charge that we had departedfrom our 1966 White Paper.6.    A simplification of the present systemThere is much to be said for simplification of the licencesystem.   Separate licences for sound radio only could be abolished and a few shillings extra added to the combined licence fees.   Themain considerations are:- 2
(i)    the cost of the 2-g- million least remunerativetransactions would go;(ii)    the licensing of sound radio receivers is in large measure unenforceable.   Even if manpower could be found for much more intensive effort against radio only licence evasion,there are severe cost-efficiency limits on the amount of moneyit is worth spending to make people take out licences costingonly twenty-five to thirty shillings.   A small modern transistorset is easily concealed; in particular.(iii)    the requirement for separate licences for car radiosis anomalous.   A licence holder can have any number of sets,including portables which he can use anywhere whether in hiscar or not without an extra licence.   An extra licence isrequired only if the set, when in the car, is powered by thecar battery.   This distinction offends commonsense.    Moreover,the requirement is hardly enforceable at all; the extralicence is virtually a voluntary payment.   It is no matter for surprise that evasion has reached a scandalous level;(iv)   but there would be a temporary loss of revenue.Between the time we announced the new system, and the time(which for operational reasons would have to be at least threemonths later; we introduced it, sales of radio only licenceswould plummet;(v)   not having the yardstick of the radio-only licence fee,the BBC would have themselves to apportion licence revenuebetween radio and television.   However, the BBC already haveto choose for themselves how much money to allow to individualradio networks;(vi)    the cost of abolishing radio licence fees would fallon viewers of whom there must be some who never listen toradio.   But among those who have radio only are presumablymany of the poorest people of all.   They would be relievedentirely;(vii)   five shillings extra on the  6 television licence feewould not be nearly enough (with the 25s, Od. comprised in it)to pay for national and local radio.   Ten shillings extrawould be more than enough.   There is no convenient stoppingplace in between.   However, a ten shilling increase would allow the BBC to carry on well beyond the mid-nineteenseventies before requiring a further increase.   Alternatively,they could keep their orchestras and still last a few months jbeyond March 197U*   If we are going to have a licence feeincrease, the temporary storm would be much the same for tenas for five shillings,   Presentationally, the simplificationcould help.On balance, the simplification is, I think well worthaccepting.- 3 -
fjt    Local licence feesIdeally, local radio stations might be financed by local licencefees, payable only by those within range of the stations.   But thiswould not work.   Reception of radio signals varies according to thequality of the listener&apos;s receiver; the time of year; the time of day; from street to street within a town; and according to personaltolerance of interference.    Definition would be impossible,enforcement a nightmare.8.    A mandatory rateOne of the problem revealed by the local radio experimenthas been that, while some local authorities have met a fair share ofthe cost, other, often for party political reasons, have not.Manchester backed out of local radio when control of the Councilchanged.   This problem could be overcome by making contributionsmandatory.   I rule out the idea that all the cost of local radioshould fall on local government, not least because that would promptpressure to give local authorities editorial control over programmecontent (which would be particularly objectionable,  since in many places the one local newspaper supports the majority party in theauthority.)9.    But we ought not to leave unconsidered the possibility of putting part of the cost on local authorities.   Perhaps part ofthe cost could &quot;be borne from the licence fee, part could come froma mandatory rate.   All local authorities would be required to paythis rate which would go into some form of regional pool.   Sincerateable values vary so much from region to region, an inter-regional equalisation might be needed.    Money would be paid from each Region&apos;s pool to the local broadcasting station or stationswithin the Region.    If there were within the Region any localauthorities whose area Was out of range of the broadcastingstation, then they might perhaps be excused the mandatory rate.   Theamount of the rate which would be needed would depend on theproportion to be financed by the rate and on the number of broadcasting stations.   Forty stations in England paid for as toone third in this way would, assuming that costs of local stations are likely to double within five years, require rather less thana l d. rate.10.   If a mandatory rate were imposed, legislation would berequired so that it might take a year before it could be introducedoSo, if we were to pursue this idea we would at this stage merelyannounce our intention of introducing such legislation and wouldhave to find interim arrangements for financing local radio until this legislation was enacted, e.g. finance from licence fees orborrowing.lit   The idea of mandatory rates would, I understand, be unpopular with the local authority associations.   But because of Maud thefinance of local government will have to be looked at again, and ifrapid progress were made (though, I gather, this is unlikely) in finding an extra way, more buoyant and equitable than rating, for financing local government, the mandatory charge might perhapsfall on that.- h -
\12.   Direct Government subventionWe commented on direct Government subvention in the 1966 white paper that it &quot;would be liable to expose the Corporation to financial control in such detail as would prove incompatible withthe BBC&apos;s independence.   The money would,  of course, have to befound from general taxation&quot;, (Cmnd, 3169, paragraph 9)*   these comments are obviously just as valid today. Although in the present financial climate I recognise that proposals for direct Governmentsubvention are unlikely to make much headway, four particularproposals need to be mentioned,13,   The first two of these have been floated by Lord Hill; thatthe BBC should be totally exempt from SET, and that the Governmentshould make up to the BBC the loss resulting from licence evasion.Both these ideas seem to me non-starters.   Both would promptbudgetary problems.    That apart, it would cut   across the wholeprinciple of SET to exempt from it organisations which provide a service, especially on the grounds that they were short of money.There is no way of estimating the amount of licence evasion withanything like enough accuracy to justify imposing a charge on the taxpayer.1U.   The third proposal is that the broadcast licence managementcosts (costs of collection and enforcement and running theinterference investigation service) should no longer be a first charge against the licence revenue.   This proposal has theadvantage that the&apos;   expenditure is already subject to financial control by the Treasury and Parliament; and if it were no    longera charge on the licence revenue there would be even greaterincentives to ensure that the work was done effectively and economically.   Also, the amount of money involved ( 5m. a year) isvery close to the estimated annual cost of running forty local radio stations.   But here too there would tee a budgetary problem.15.   The fourth proposal is to give the BBC the proceeds of aspecial purchase tax on radio sets.   This proposal was considered and rejected by the Ministerial   Committee on BBC Finance last october (FB(68)2; FB(68)2nd meeting, Item 2).   The arguments against it were, we judged at the time, overwhelming; and there is no newreason to depart from the decision.16,   Voluntary contributionsWe have already noted that the experiment has shown thatvoluntary contributions are unsatisfactory as the main means of support for local radio,   American experience bears this out.Despite the inducement of an advertising-free service, the survival of subscription stations in uncertain there.    The only realcontributors would be local authorities.   There are two main reasons why local contributions will not work:- 5 -
(l)   Their uncertainty,   A change in a local authority&apos;political complexion could at any time close the localstation down.(ii)   Some areas are richer than others.   A Id. rate inBrighton produces six times as much as a Id. rate inStoke-on-Trent. , But the less prosperous areas may need local radio as much or more.17.   However, I have been told by representatives of the experimental areas that all would be willing to continue some contribution.   One or two of them talked in terms of  5,000 ayear.18.   It seems reasonable that the   BBC should provide an amplebasic local radio service, but that local communities should beleft to choose whether to pay for optional extras.   But, if local radio is not to become a football in local politics, the line should, I suggest, be drawn there.19.   Limited sponsorshipClause 13 of my Licence and Agreement with the BBC (Cmnd, 2236)forbids the BBC to transmit sponsored programmes.   It could be changed if the BBC and I, with Treasury approval, agreed to change i20.   I share entirely the BBC&apos;s view that their: services should notbe supported by commercial sponsorshop advertising the general run of consumer goods.   At first sight there are not the samearguments of principle against a much more limited, sponsor ship e.g.by Government Departments, local authorities, nationalised industries, the churches and voluntary organisations and possibly also private sector industry for some activities other than saleof goods to the public, e.g. recruitment advertising.   these activities get a great deal of free support from the BBC.   Thequestion is whether they should be paid for.21. Objections are:(i)   Diversion of even a small amount of advertising revenuecould jeopardise some local newspapers.   On whether it would,opinions among journalists differ.(ii)   Limited sponsorship could be the thin end of the wedgeleading in time to a commercial BBC.(iii)   Although the proposal itself does not, of course, meansponsored programmes in the American sense, in time it mightbe twisted to include them.   My colleagues will recall that,when the 1954 Television Act was before Parliament, thepossibility of allowing sponsored programmes was firmlyrejected by all parties.- 6 -
(iv)   There is probably little money in it.22.   I recognise that there is something in each of these objections, but I think the idea needs exploring more before itcan be dismissed entirely.    On the other hand it is unlikely to be-more than a marginal source of additional revenue for local radiobut it might be useful..   If my colleagues agree, I propose todiscuss it further with the local authority associations, theNational Union of Journalists, the Newspaper Society, and the BBC.But there is no reason why we should delay meanwhile our decisionon the main question of finance.Conclusion23.   Ideally, the method of financing broadcasting services should be:(i)    consistent with the social objectives, direct and indirect, to which this scarce medium, at public disposal,should be applied;(ii)    enough, but no more than enough income, to secure these objectives over a period of, say four or five yearsinto the future;(iii)    such as would not lead to undue discrimination asbetween one part and another of the country in the services provided;(iv)   assured;(v)    acceptable to public opinion;(vi)   as economically collected as possible;For local radio with the population coverage now envisaged Iwould add:(vii)    that it would be desirable, though it should not inview of (iii) and (iv) be made a sine qua non, that thereshould be some specifically local provision.Of the methods discussed in this paper, none is perfect; but a standard licence fee, simplified on the lines of paragraph 6 above and covering both the national and local services, most nearlysatisfies the ideal.   Some measure of local financial support for local radio is desirable.   If it cannot be secured by mandatoryrate, it has to be left on a voluntary footing,   I invite mycolleagues to agree:- 7 -
that I should make am early announcement of a decision to simplify the licence and to increase the fee from  6 to 6. 10s.that I should announce a decision to authorise the BBC toestablish a general service of local radio, financed fromlicence revenue but free to seek additional financial support locally.General Post Office,St. Martin&apos;s-le-Grand,E.C.1.10th July, 1969.- 8
