DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)29th July. 1969C(69) 111POST OFFICE ENGINEERING UNION PAY CLAIMCABINETCOPY NO.Memorandum by the Lord Privy seal at a meeting of the Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomeson 25th July I was invited, in consultation with the First Secretary, toadvise on the consequences that may be expected to follow in the public and private sectors from a settlement of the Post Office Engineering Union(POEU) claim for a pay increase of 10 per cent from 1st July, 1969 to coverproductivity improvements up to 31st March, 1970 and movements in the outside wage rates up to 1st July, 1969 on any of three bases, viz:7 per cent, 83 per cent or 7 per cent now and 3 per cent on 1st January, 1970.Implications of possible offers2.      The net productivity savings are sufficient in total to cover anincrease of 5. 6 per cent.    Any offer which exceeds the productivity savingsis bound to imply either that it includes also something on account of otherwage movements or that it results from militant action, or both.    Theoffer of 7 per cent already made has had the repercussions I foresaw forthe industrial Civil Service.    An offer of 3f per cent with a reference tothe National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) to determine the basis for future pay improvement might have been accepted by industrial civil servants, albeit reluctantly, before 7 per cent was offered to POEU.It has been rejected by the more lowly paid industrial Civil Service largely because of the better offer to POEU and there have been indications ofindustrial action in the Royal Dockyards and Royal Ordnance Factories,immediately threatening the Polaris programme and important export orders.    I have had to seek the agreement of my colleagues to an offer of 7 per cent, including 2 per cent for compression of pay scales, with a reference to NBPI.3.      The majority of civil servants (655, 000) had Interim central pay increases in July.    Those who, like the POEU, had had no increase since junly, 1968 had &quot;h\ per cent, those who had waited longer 5 per cent.    Theagreement made with the Staff Side collectively will not be repudiated, buta settlement with the militant POEU at twice the annual ceiling, which is
not based on productivity alone, will result in pressures on the more responsible Civil Service unions to mount a new claim in a few months1time.    In the Post Office itself the already militant Union of Post office workers (UPW) will be in serious difficulty in relation to the postmen(120,000) and others, totalling 209,000 who received only the 3-f- per centcentral pay increase.4.      To go as far as 8^ per cent would increase pressures beyond thepoint at which they could be contained by the moderate leaderwhip of theCivil Service trade unions.    My proposed offer of 7 per cent to industrial civil servants may lead to a settlement, but if subsequently, the offer made to the POEU is 8j per cent this could well lead to charges of bad faith.    Militancy in the Civil Service would be encouraged and the wholeatmosphere of staff relations would be worsened.5.      The Civil Service pay system rests on periodical reviews based onfair comparison following pay research, with modest interim increases,at present within the incomes ceiling to prevent pay falling too far behind.A very sore point at present is *hat the pay research increases have to bestaged in abrogation of the Civil Service Pay Agreement so that any increase above the annual ceiling is paid a year later.    The PostmasterGeneral has already had to reserve his position, as I have mine, inrelation to the timing of Stage II of the increases recently awarded toprofessional engineers.    Even a V per cent increase for the POEU gradeswould almost certainly force the Postmaster General to seek to introduceStage II immediately instead of on 1st January, 1970.    The cost in theCivil Service of shortening staging by five months will be about 2.8 million in the current financial year.6.      7 per cent now and 3 per cent later could be represented by thePOEU as meeting their demand for 10 per cent, and would prove thatmilitancy pays.    The immediate effect on the Civil Service might bemarginally less than an offer of Of per cent with a pay review in 1970,particularly in relation to the industrial Civil Service.    Outside the CivilService however the capitulation of the Government as employer tomilitant demands would be very harmful.7.      The British P^ailways Board will very shortly commencenegotiations with the unions for what they describe as &quot;Pay and EfficiencyStage II&quot;.    Their estimate of the global figure within which they hope toreach a settlement is awaitedj we know that they have in mind a figureconsiderably less than 10 per cent or even 8^ per cent.    Approval by theGovernment of a POEU settlement of up to 8&quot;! per cent or 7 per cent plus3 per cent, would inevitably have repercussions on these negotiations.It could also have repercussions on negotiations for Gas staffs which are about to start this week.-2-
JSq ual pay.8.       The Postmaster General has already suggested that the pay ofsome 1,400 Post Office women should be increased, though for the greatmajority of them there are no corresponding male grades.    As Iunderstand it, the First Secretary intends to initiate, in the near future,a general discussion on equal pay policy, following her consultations withthe Confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress.In further discussions on Monday, 28th July, the Postmaster General has,I understand, half committed the Post Office to en additional improvementin the pay of these women.    Though the cost to the Post Office of a move in this direction would be small, about  100, 000 a year, a similar move in the industrial Civil Service could cost around  1 million a year.    But,much wider than this, it would be difficult to resist an early move outsidethe Civil Service if the Government accepted the Postmaster Generalfsproposal for these Post Office grades.    It is not possible to estimate whatthe cost of this would be, but it would be very much greater.conclusion.      There can be little doubt that a settlement beyond the 7 per cent,which has already had the effects I foresaw, would greatly increasepressures on pay negotiations, not only within the Civil Service, butthroughout the whole of the public and the private sector.    It seems tome, therefore, that the choice is between standing on 7 per cent coupled,as we are proposing in relation to the industrial Civil Service, withreference to the Prices and Incomes Board, or a surrender in the face ofthe threat of industrial action to what the POEU has claimed.S.House of Lords, S.W.I.29th July, 1959-3-
