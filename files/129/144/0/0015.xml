0SDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENT)C(69) 1153rd September, 1969NATIONAL NEWSPAPER PRICE increases memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeUnder the Early Warning arrangements, the Board of Trade havereceived notifications of proposed increases in the prices of The Times,the Sunday Express, the Daily Express, the People, the Sunday Mirrorand the Daily Mirror.2.      The details of the proposals, the background to them and ourassessment of them are set out in the Annex to this memorandum.3.      Three possible courses of action are set out in paragraph 11 ofthe Annex.    I consider the effective choice lies between course (a) andcourse (c).    Course (b) would not be reasonable in relation to The Times;indeed, if we took it I think we could be criticised for penalising past price restraint.4.      The balance of the arguments lead me to support course (a).    I willexplain more fully why I have come to this conclusion at the Cabinet meetingon Thursday, 4th September.C.A. RC.Board of Trade, S.W.1.2nd September, 1969COPY NO.CABINET61
NATIONAL NEWSPAPER PRICE increases the Board of Trade have received Early Warning   -tifications from three national newspaper publishers:(a) Times Newspapers:    The Times from 6d. to 8d.in September 1 96 9 and to 9d. early in 1 970.(b) Beaverbroolc Newspapers:    The Sunday Express from7d.  to 8d. on 7th September 1969 and the daily express from 5d. to 6d. on 1st January 1970.(c) I.P.C. Newspapers:    The People and the Sunday Mirroreach from 7d. to 8d. as soon as possible and the daily Mirror from 5d. to 6d. after 1st March 1970.The reasons for these proposed increases are as follows:(a) The Times is running at a loss.    Its present priceof 6d. was established in November 1964-    Since then,costs have risen greatly and the paper itself has been changed and expanded.    Management has concentrated onexpanding circulation (which has risen from 256,000 in1964 to 437,000 in the first half of 1969).    Anincrease to 7d. was notified in the general round ofnewspaper price increases that followed devaluationand we said we would raise no objection;    in. theevent, Times Newspapers did not implement the increaseThe Times is currently running at an annual deficit of about  2m. and further increases in costs areimminent (for labour from September 1969 and fornewsprint from January 1970).    The annual increase in revenue of The Times from increasing the price to 8d.would be f.624,000 and to 9d. about  900,000.    Therewill still be a large deficit and management do not expect to get out of the red before 1972.    Meanwhile,circulation is still rising steadily and managementpresumably judge that they can charge a more realistic cover price without reversing this trendwhich has been their priority target.(b) Beaverbroolc Newspapers:    The trend of profits inrelation to turnover has been declining and a furthersharp decrease is foreseen because of further rises in costs.    For the year ended 30th June 1969, on a gross income of  48,258,000, profit was  1,725,000before tax and  863,000 after tax.    The company have reviewed their forecasts for the year 1969/70 and,against gross income of  51m., it seems profit beforetax may not exceed  1m.    Cost increases of  1 .6m.include  0.5m. and  0.39m. for the wage awardseffective in September 1 968 and 1 969-    The grossrevenue to Beaverbroolc (in a full year) from theproposed increases would be about  400,000 from the sunday Express and about  2.6m. from the Daily express the current average circulations are Sunday Express4,235,326 and Daily Express 3,731,673-    These are both fairly static;   over the past couple of
years, the&apos;Sunday has gained a&apos;little.and the daily has lost slightly more.(c)    I.P.C. Newspapers:    This notification refers to pricerises designed to yield an annual increase in income of  4m. of which approximately  1m. is earmarked for increases in the cost of newsprint, national insurancerates, etc., and  1.2m. for losses in the first year of the Daily Mirror colour magazine (which is being introduced in September 1969).    In addition to notingthe provision for these specific items, I.P.C. refer to the financial implications of their policy of becoming less dependent on advertising revenue andthe need for adequate profitability to maintain and continue their research and development on new print;in/jmethods.    The notification also refers to early capital costs of  1m. in respect of the People (and SportingLife) consequential on the closure of the Sun.    Thecurrent average circulations are the People 5,455,372;the Sunday Mirror 5,008,731  and the Daily Mirror4,924,157*    These are all large circulations;    asexpected, they went down a little when prices were increased in 1968.    I.P.C. also say that, short of somematerial change, they would not expect to apply forfurther price increases before the summer of 1 971 .The national newspaper industry-3.     The position and problems of the national newspaperindustry are well known and have been the subject of manyinvestigations.    There have been two Royal Commissions sincethe war, the Survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit in 1966(initiated by the industry itself) and a Report by the N.B.P.I.in 1967 (Cmnd. 3435).    Although the inefficiency of the industry(particularly in the under-use and overpayment of labour) hasbeen repeatedly highlighted, attempts to improve the positionhave not achieved much.    At the same time, there is widespreadconcern over the maintenance of an adequate range of nationalnewspapers;   many devices, involving intervention by Governmentin various ways, have been canvassed but the conclusion so farhas always been that these devices would cause more problemsthan they would cure.    There has been considerable support forthe proposition that the national newspapers would be less vulnerable if their selling prices were higher, so that theywere less dependent on advertising revenue which is liable tofluctuate with the economy.The proposed price increases4.     The notifications we have now received need to beconsidered on their own merits and in relation to the industry generally.    The proposed increase in the price of The Timesdoes not seem really open to criticism on grounds of prices and incomes policy.    If the newspaper industry generally could bemore successful in containing labour costs, this would - in time -do something to reduce the costs of The Times.    But any suchsaving would be small compared with the deficit at which The Timesis currently running.    This deficit is a result primarily not of excessive production costs but of management&apos;s deliberate
marketing policy of selling a greatly improved product at anold price, in order to increase the foothold in the market.Management believes.that it has now reached a point where itcan raise the price to a level which, while still incurring a loss, will be rather more realistic.    The important judgmentfor them is that they believe they can do this without impairingthe growth of circulation.    (The experience of increases by otherquality newspapers - The Financial Times&apos;  2d.  in 1967 and TheGuardian&apos;s 1 d.  in 1 968 - would appear to support their judgment.)If it is decided not to object to an increase in the price ofThe Times to 8d., one corollary should be noted.    The Guardian,v/hich also sells at 6d. and runs at a loss, might decide tofollow suit;    there would presumably be no grounds for objection -and, indeed, the increase might materially strengthen TheGuardian&apos;s situation.5.     The case of Beaverbrook Newspapers is not so clear-cut.The information they have submitted shows their need for additional revenue;    the scope for economies from increased efficiency is relatively greater - but it is unrealistic tothink these could be achieved in the short term, which is whereBeaverbrook now need some relief.    There is a gap of over threemonths between the dates of their two proposed price increases.Unless we are prepared to try to hold up Beaverorook&apos;saltogether, we could consider dealing with the two notificationsseparately.6.     The case of I.P.C. is more difficult.    Their purpose isnot to reduce a deficit (as with The Times) or to try to getquick relief (as with Beaverbrook).    In their financial year ending February 1969 profitability in the I.P.C. NewspaperDivision was substantially greater than before.    Because of increased costs, the current year&apos;s profit was expected to showa reduction of about  1m.    We are seeking further informationbut on the face of it this notification suggests that the increases in price are designed to raise profitability abovelast year&apos;s high level.    Three points stand out:(i)   Although, in the short term, the relief from closure of the Sun will be counterbalanced by redundancy payments, reorganisation costs, etc., no mention ismade of the long term relief to I.P.C.(ii)   The 1967 N.B.P.I. Report ruled against a price increase in the Daily Mirror because of the scope for cost containment;    I.P.C. do not mention currentefforts to this end.(iii)   The hint of further price increases in the summer of 1971 is not encouraging.7.     The questions for decision are whether these price increases should be allowed or whether there should be a reference to theN.B.P.I.    Three things are clear.    First, the lack of room for manoeuvre when one is dealing with price increases as small as one penny.    Secondly, the difficulty of raising no objection to increases by some but trying to restrain others.    I.P.C.certainly have room for further cost containment but so have3
Aothers.    If we were to restrain I.P.C., because they are moreprofitable, and the prices of I.P.C.&apos;s populars were not raised,it is doubtful whether Beaverbroolc and others could in practiceraise the prices of their populars, at least without riskingcirculation.    Thirdly, if all the current notifications go through, it would not be reasonable to worry about others.In practice, of the popular Sundays only the News of the world would remain;   and of the dailies only the Daily Mail and the daily Sketch - and the Daily Telegraph.    (if the Sun is reborn,its new management will presumably be free to decide on astarting price.)8.     If there is a reference, various alternatives are possible.The Times could be allowed to go up to 8d. with the further 1d.depending on the N.B.P.I.&apos;s Report.    Beaverbrook and I.P.C. couldbe allowed to put up their Sundays, with the dailies depending on the N.B.P.I.&apos;s Report.    If this were done, the increases which the applicants consider it commercially necessary tointroduce quickly would go through, leaving the 1970 price increases (and indeed the overall positions of the newspapergroups) for study in depth by the N.B.P.I. before a decisionneed be taken on these later increases.9.     The arguments for making a Reference are:(a) A Reference would provide another opportunity forhighlighting the continuing failure of the nationalnewspaper industry to contain increased costs and totake effective steps to reduce its own notoriousinefficiency.    In making the Reference, the Governmentwould demonstrate that they were not connivingin this deplorable situation.    If the Report camedown against all or any of the price increases, theirimplementation could be deferred;    eleven months fromthe Reference - i.e. until July 1970 - is the longestdeferment we could impose under our statutory powers.    (Since the Daily Mirror increase is in anycase not proposed to be made before 1st March 1970,we could at best delay it only for a few months.)(b) A Reference would keep up the pressure to improve efficiency in the industry.    Perhaps a more effectiveopportunity was missed when it was in the end decided not to make a Reference on the wage agreements whichare now having their effect;   but the Reference couldbe framed so as to direct the N.3.P.I.1s attentionto the question of whether these agreements werereaping commensurate increases in increasedproduc t ivi ty.(c) The publishers&apos; cases are not, at any rate so far,clear-cut.    The information so far submitted by I.P.C.is incomplete;    as it stands, it does not demonstrate that the whole of the proposed increases are necessary,in terms of the prices and incomes criteria, to meetunabsorbable increases in costs and to finance futured development.    Beaverbrook clearly need some increasedrevenue to improve liquidity and finance development.(The case of The Times is unusual and it would be verydifficult to object to it.)
i. 10.    The arguments against making a Reference are:(a) There is nothing new that the N.B.P.I. could say,after all the reports there have been about this industry.    There is no real reason to think thatany more notice would be taken if the N.B.P.I.said it again, particularly by the Unions who show no real&apos; intention to abandon&apos; their entrenchedpositions of overmanning and high earnings.    (Weunderstand the recent efforts of the D.E.P.&apos;sManpower Productivity Service to stimulate greater efficiency following the 1967 pay and productivity agreements have been able to achieve little.)(b) There are some risks that the N.B.P.I.&apos;s report could be positively embarrassing to us.    Their 1967Report laid emphasis on newspapers getting theircosts down before putting their prices up.    This isof course the priority we would all prefer.    But,in paragraph 57 of their Report, the N.B.P.I.added the recommendation that, if the industry didstart to come to grips with the problem, theGovernment should contribute by special contributions towards the costs of redundancy payments and re-training.    This proposal to single out an industry for extra financial assistance on grounds of itsexceptional inefficiency was unacceptable, and would obviously have raised problems in relation to other,more efficient, industries.    We were able to side-stepthe recommendation because the whole situation wasovertaken by devaluation, when increases in newsprintcosts made higher newspaper prices unavoidable.    Butit would be awkward if the N.B.P.I. reverted to thisrecommendation.    Further, there are the various otherdevices which have been canvassed involving government intervention in the national newspaper industry (somewith financial implications).    We - and the majorityof vocal opinion - have come down against these devices.The N.B.P.I. have already shown some interest inthese (see paragraphs 58 and 59 of their Report) andit would not be helpful if they now embraced one orother of them;    and, if they did, attention would be diverted from the inescapable need for the industryto put its own house in order.(c) There has been some pressure on the Government -renewed since I.P.C. decided to drop the Sun - to intervene in the national newspaper situation or atleast to set up a Royal Commission or other Inquiry.We have said there is nothing new to enquire into.If we make a Reference on price increases, it could besaid that, having declined to intervene positively,we were now obstructing the industry in taking onecourse open to it to strengthen its financial basis,i.e. by working towards a position of greaterdependence on circulation revenue and less dependence on advertising revenue, which is liable to fluctuatewith the economy.Iif-.
Possible courses i \i 2 IL^L-J ^1 i Im.Li11.    There are three possible courses:(a) To inform Times Newspapers, Beaverbrook and I.P.C.that we would raise no objection to their proposals.(A corollary would be that we would let otherapplicants through.)(b) To make a further Reference to the N.B.P.I. on costs and revenue of national newspapers and to askTimes Newspapers, Beaverbrook and I.P.C. to withholdtheir proposed increases pending the Report.We would presumably use our Statutory Powers to freezeprices if this request was not met voluntarily.(c) To make such a general Reference but not to delaydealing with individual notifications on their merits where these are clear.    The Times would beallowed to increase its price to 8d. but would beaslced not to go up to 9d. pending the N.B.P.I.&apos;sReport.    (The Guardian, if it applied, would similarly be  allowed to go up to 7d. or 8d.)   Beaverbrookand I.P.C. might be allowed to increase the prices,of their Sundays.    The Reference would be givensubstance by asking Beaverbrook and I.P.C. to await the Report before increasing the prices of theirdailies.    Since these increases are scheduled for january and March 1970, we could hope this requestwould be met voluntarily.
