[$DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY.OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYrS GOVERNMENT)C(69) 11328th August, 1969COPY NO.3 /CABINETEQUAL pay memorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretary ofState for Employment and Productivity.At the end of July the Management Committee discussed at my request the question of equal pay for women.    It was agreed that whenhe addressed the Trades Union Congress (TUC) on 1st September, thePrime Minister should indicate that I would be entering forthwith into discussions with the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and TUCon this subject.    We would then have to decide in the light of these discussions what should be said about equal pay at the Labour party conference and, in particular, whether legislation should be promisedin The Queen&apos;s Speech.    Meanwhile I was asked to arrange for an urgent study to be made of the probable economic and social consequences of introducing equal pay in preparation for a cabinet discussion at the beginning of September,,    This study has now beencompleted and a report by officials is attached to this memorandum.The background.      We included the right to equal pay for equal worK in the chapterof rights for all workers in the 1964 Election Manifesto,,    Of the sevenitems there listed, equal pay is almost the only one on which we havemade no move.    In the 1966 Manifesto, we said that we had startednegotiations with the CBI and TUC.    In June, 1968, I told the Houseof Commons that I would be entering into discussions with the CBIand TUC with a view to agreeing a timetable for phasing in the implementation of equal pay over an appropriate period,,3.      As a result of these discussions v/e embarked on a survey of the cost of equal pay in a number of major industries.    The resultsof that survey have now been analysed and discussed at official levelwith the CBI and TUC,    They have also formed an important part ofthe raw material for the annexed study by officials.-1-
4,      At Conference last year the TUG carried a resolution in favour of implementing equal pay for work of equal value in a period of two year the resolution further called on affiliated unions to support those thattake industrial action in support of the principle of equal pay0    Thereare resolutions on equal pay down for this year&apos;s Conference by theNational Union of Tailors and Garment Workers and Transport andGeneral Workers Union.    The General Councils Report says thatit is anticipated that I v/ill have held meetings with the TUC (andCBI) before the Conference to discuss the report of the industrialsurvey mentioned above and &quot;what legislative action will be requiredto implement equal pay&quot;,    I have, in fact, had some difficulty indeferring a meeting with the TUC until after the Conference05.       The CBI are not opposed to the principle of equal pay, butthey argue that it v/ill add to industrial costs, that its implementationshould be delayed until the economy is stronger, and that it should be phased in over a long period.    They are doubtful in any case whetherthe introduction of equal pay is a matter for Government action,.,    Theytoo are waiting to resume discussions with me in the light of theindustrial survey and, like the TUC, will expect me tc say what our intentions are.6,      Finally, I should mention that moves towards equal pay areassuming increasing importance in the course of normal pay negotiations.We have received a number of examples through the wage vettingmachinery of greater percentage increases, or similar and sometimesgreater cash increases, for women than for men.    They extend over a variety of firms and industries and in some cases the improvements have been secured after industrial action.The definition of equal pay,       The tv/o main definitions of equal pay are &quot;equal pay for thesame work&quot; which has been adopted by the European economic commission and is favoured by the CBIj and &quot;equal pay for workof equal value&quot; which is enshrined in International LabourOrganisation (ILO) Convention No. 100, and is favoured bythe TUC.8,      Equal pay for work of equal value does not apply nowbetween one man and another and it is not clear why it should apply as between women and men who are doing basically differentjobsa    It has no obvious and precise meaning;  its interpretation inparticular cases could be widely disputed;  and its implementation wouldprobably call for elaborate job evaluation exercises in firms and industries.    The cost could, and in the short run certainly would,be a good deal higher than a more precise definition,
9.       Equal pay for the same work does not have the same drawbacks.It is more limited, more readily definable; and less costly to implement,    This is not to say that it would be without difficulty0It could not be restricted simply to cases where men and women are engaged on precisely the same work in the same factory oroffice.    It would be necessary to provide that where women were carrying out work broadly similar in character to that of men, the pay should be the same.    Moreover, employers have made it clear in the recent industrial survey that where the pay of a substantial proportion of women in a factory or office moved into equality withmen in accordance with a legal requirement, the other women not directly covered would inevitably seek some upward adjustment intheir pay too0    Thus, if a large number of women secure improvements in direct consequence of the introduction of equal pay, this must beexpected to pull up the general level of women&apos;s pay throughout the economy.The costs of introducing equal pay10,       The annexed report by officials analyses the main economicand social implications of introducing equal pay over the period1970-75.    it draws on experience in this country and abroad aswell as the industrial survey carried out in co-operation with the cbi and TUC.    The definition adopted is that of equal pay for samework, but full allowance has been made for the indirect effectsdescribed in the previous paragraph,,    I must emphasise that the study has been carried out very quickly; much of the information on which it is based is inadequate; and precision in the estimates of the effects on costs, prices and the balance of payments isimpossible,11, Subject to these qualifications, the main conclusions,all of which are based on the most conservative (i, et highestcost) interpretation of the evidence, are as followss-(i)  The upper limit of the increase in the country^ total wage and salary bill, allowing for indirect effects, would be 5 per cent over the period, representing an average increase in women&apos;s earnings of about 25 per cent.    In practice the increase may well prove smaller than this,(ii) It is not certain whether women could expect to get this increaseplus the normal growth in earnings that v/ould be expected over theperiod.    Similarly, it is not certain whether men would attempt tomaintain, or at any rate succeed in maintaining, existing differentialsbetween men&apos;s and women1 s occupations,,
(iii) Women manual workers in manufacturing would receive largerpercentage increases in pay than women office v/orkers who are,however, better paid at present]  women office v/orkers would doat least as v/ell and possibly better than women in service industries;and the probability is that the lowest paid women, many of whom arein the service industries, would benefit least.(iv) The impact of equal pay on total costs (not just labour costs)would vary as between industries and, particularly, firms.Manufacturing costs would probably increase by about the same amount as those of the economy as a whole (i. e, an upper limit of 4 per cent) but some sectors such as clothing and pottery wouldbe particularly affected.    Retail distribution would be worse affectedthan wholesaling or transport    In practice the spread of costs would tend to even itself out more than the preliminary estimates suggest,but there is little doubt that some firms, for example in doming,pottery and electronics, would be faced with major problems ofadaptation during the period of implementation.(v) Prices would increase on average by a maximum of 4 percent,(vi) Latest estimates suggest that the cost to the balance ofpayments in 1975 might be some  350 million if the total wage and salary bill increased by 5 per cent.    The report stresses,however, that this is the upper limit: if, as may well be, theincrease in the wage and salary bill is less than this, and allowance is made e, g, for time lags and the response of employers to equal pay, the cost to the balance of payments could be significantly less.(vii) The effects on employment seem unlikely to be significant forthe economy as a whole; overall there is likely to be an increase in thenumber of women available for employment and a decrease in the growth of job opportunities.    No special problems are envisaged in thedevelopment areas,(viii) The effects on social security benefits, and on public expenditure generally would be small.    So would the effects on industrial costs caused by higher employers1 contributions to the National Insurance Fund and for Selective employment tax.(ix)  The rise in purchasing power of households with malev/orkers only would be slightly less (4 per cent) than withoutequal pay;  so would that of households with no workers0 butthe majority of these could expect to receive enhanced social security payments to compensate for the increase in prices.
12,       I recognise that any additional increase in the national wagebill and, therefore, in our costs of production could have detrimentaleconomic effects,    I also recognise that the implementation of equal pay could have awkward implications for incomes policy,    I do notthink it would be possible to insist, given the voluntary nature of thenext phase of incomes policy, that progress tov/ards equal pay shouldbe accommodated within the norm of     per cent which is likely to be recommended to Cabinet,    A possible compromise might be to acceptincreases on equal pay grounds as exceptions above the norm but, forpresentational purposes, to reduce the norm to, say, 3 per cent? butthis would make little practical difference.    Finally, I recognise thata phased programme for equal pay, backed by legislation and incor-porated as part of incomes policy, may be opposed by the CBI,13,      On the other hand, I must stress that officials have quitedeliberately taken a pessimistic view about the likely costs of implementing equal pay,    There are sound reasons for suggesting that the effects on labour costs and total costs may be a good dealless than those quoted in paragtaph 11,    This, of course, wouldhave significant implications for prices and, particularly, thebalance of payments,14,      I am sure that it would be quite wrong for us to imagine that in the absence of a Government sponsored phased programmenothing will happen on equal pay.    Quite the contrary.    If we havea five-year programme, employers will certainly argue, probablysuccessfully, that increases should be phased over this period.Without such a programme, employers will be under continuouspressure to make what may be sharp adjustments in women&apos;s pay to eliminate discrimination.    There is already evidence of this.The industries best able to meet the cost will give way;  and otherswill then be forced to follow suit,150      I think, therefore, that it would be wrong to assume that inthe next two or three years the cost of a five-year phased programme would be much greater than allowing equal pay to be implemented,without any guidelines, in industrial negotiations.    There would,almost certainly, be delays in negotiating the start of phasedindustry programmes; and the indirect effects would make themselves felt more towards the end of the period than atthe beginning,16,      Finally, the TUC and individual trade unions intend to put a lot of pressure now behind equal pay.    Their attitude to the subject in the past has been equivocal if not hypocritical,but there is now a marked change.    If we decide against a Governmentsponsored programme, we will, without doubt, come under severe criticism from the trade union movement and, for that matter, fromthe Party,
17,       My own view is that the evidence produced by officials and thebalance of economic and political argument are in favour of introducing legislation in the next Session,    I am confident that the TUC can be persuaded that equal pay for the same or broadly similar work is asmuch as we can sensibly accomplish.    This would be in line with theEuropean Economic Commission and would, I believe, be sufficient toenable us to ratify the appropriate ILO conventions.The timing and content of legislation18,      I said in the House of Commons that I could see no reason whya phased programme for equal pay should take longer than seven years,,That was in 1968,    I think, therefore, that we ought to set 31st December,,1975, as the date by.which equal pay should be in force,    If anannouncement to this effect were made this autumn, and legislation passed in the next Session, we should have a five-year programme for implementation (end-.1970 to end-1975)e    And industry would havebeen given six years notice in which to sort out its problems,19,       Both the TUC and the CBI have emphasised th.3 desirability of allowing industries and particular firms to make their own arrangementsfor moving to equal pay in accordance with their own circumstances,,    I agree with this.    What is needed is a legal framework within v/hich theseindustrial negotiations can take place, and v/hich will also deal ultimatelywith employers - particularly in weakly organised industries - who do not take action voluntarily,20,      I suggest that the best course would be as follows.    We shouldlegislate in the next Session to provide that on and after 31st December,1975, it should be an offence for an employer to discriminate in pay andother conditions of employment between men and women where they are engaged on the same or broadly similar work.    In order to ensure thatthe elimination of discrimination was not left until the last minute,particularly where workers are weakly organised, the legislation should also provide that women should not be paid less than 90 percent of the rate paid to men for the same or broadly similar workafter 31st December, 1973,210      It would follow from the &quot;no discrimination&apos;1 clause that itwould be illegal to conclude a collective agreement in which women1 rates were specified separately from men&apos;s rates (as is customary atpresent).    All rates in collective agreements v/ould have to apply to specific classes of workers or specific occupations regardless of whether they were carried out by men or women,    A tribunal wouldbe established to which individual workers or their unions could takecases where they asserted that discrimination was being practised,
220      Some legislation, in particular the Factories Act 1961, imposesrestrictions on the hours of employment of women but not upon men doing the same work.    It will probably be desirable to take the opportunityafforded by legislation on equal pay to put women on the same footing as men in this respect.Conclusion23,      The time has come when, in my view, we must take a decision as to whether we are going to embark on a Government sponsoredprogramme leading to equal pay for women,    It is no longer possibleto stalL    Expectations have been raised: we muat either fulfil them or say publicly and firmly that we cannot go ahead because of ourpresent economic difficulties,24,      I recommend that we should proceed.    It would be a clear and direct proof of our intention to move towards the social objectives which we set ourselves for this period of office.    It will also probablybecome an inescapable commitment if we succeed in entering theEuropean Economic Community,,    I do not believe the cost isunmanageable, and it will build up relatively slowly under a phasedprogramme of the kind I have suggested a    By refusing to proceedwe will not prevent the impetus towards equal pay from gainingmomentum in the normal course of pay negotiations;  we may alsobe storing up industrial trouble for our selves 025.      Whatever our decision,, the TUC, the CBI and the party conference must now be told0    Personally I hope my colleagues will agree that the balance of arguments is in favour of going forward.B, A0 C,Department of Employment and Productivity, S.

THE   ECONOMIC   AND   SOCIAL   IMPLICATIONS   OF   EQUAL   pay for  WOMENNote by the Interdepartmental Group on Equal pay,   We were set up*:-&quot;To examine the implications for the Government1s financial,economic and social policies of enacting, in the 1969-70Session, legislation requiring employers to give fall effectto the principle of equal pay by the end of 1975I and toreport in time to enable the Cabinet to consider the question in the first week of September.&quot;2,    This note draws on experience in this country and abroadj and makesuse of material collected recently from a sample of 230 firms which were asked what they would expect the impact of equal pay to be.   The note dealswith the following points:A. The increase in the national wage and salary bill likely to arise directly or indirectly from equal pay and the impact on different occupational groups.B. The impact on the total costs of different groups of industries.C. The effect on price structures and Government expenditure.D. The effect of changes in industrial costs on the balance ofpayments.E. The effects on employment and unemployment (both of women andmen).F. Special effects in the Development Areas.G. Effects on the social security system.H. Effects on the distribution of income between families with different combinations of working members.I. Effects on Incomes Policy.Ijre meaning of &quot;Equal Pay&quot;3.    For the purposes of this note it is assumed that the legislation wouldrequire discrimination in pay on grounds of sex to be abolished both within each establishment of any individual employer and in collective wage orsalary agreements.   Discrimination would be defined as different rates of pay (or other conditions of employment) for the same job or for a job whichwas essentially the same as a job done by men, i.e. where the differenceswere only slight.A.
4.    There are sone 8g- million female enployees of whom sone 1^ nillionalready get equal pay.   It is extremely difficult to say x^ith certaintyhow many of the remaining 7 million would be directly affected by thelegal requirement described.   What can be said with certainty is that theeffect on women&apos;s pay will not be confined to those directly affected.Employers are clear that where (say) half the wonen in an establishment get an increase in pay because of the legal requirement it will be inevitablefor upward adjustments to be made in the pay of other women in the estab-lishnent.   Similarly, if the clerks in an office get an increase, it willbe difficult to resist some increase in the pay of typists, or machineoperators, or telephone switchboard operators, even though they are not directly affected by equal pay, and their rates of pay are not tied directly to the clerks&apos; rates.5.    Moreover, increases in iTOmen&apos;s pay in certain establishments where menand women are working on the same jobs will tend to influence women&apos;s payin other establishments in the same area even if no direct effects of equal pay occur.   In short, if a large number of women get higher pay this musttend to pull up the general level of women&apos;s pay throughout the economy.6.    In this note therefore the effects of equal pay are examined in thelight of the probable total effect on women&apos;s pay, and not merely theinnediate and direct effects flowing from the statutory requirement.
A      (i)   The total cost of equal pay.    We can start from the fact that in national agreements a woman&apos;s rate of pay is usually about 80 per cent of the man&apos;s rate for similar classes of work.If the minimum rates&apos; were equalised (and women getting more than the minimumreceived a corresponding increase) and if related rates, e.g. for overtime, were also equalised, this would suggest an increase of 25 per cent in the earnings ofthe women concerned.   If we assume that all women and not only the women directly affected by the legislation get an increase on average of 25 per cent, this would raise the national wage and salary bill by 5 per cent.    It is unlikely that the indirect effects would be so extensive, bearing in mind particularly thatmillion women already get equal pay.    So 5 per cent may be taken to be theextreme upper limit of a possible range of costs.8.     The validity of this figure may be checked against the experience ofindustries in the U.K. where equal pay has already been introduced and againstthe experience of other countries.   The available data shows how women&apos;s earningsexpressed as a proportion of men&apos;s earnings have been affected by the introductiorof equal pay.   At present women&apos;s hourly earnings in the U.K. are 60 per cent ofmen&apos;s.   Increases of 16 per cent, 25 per cent and 33 per cent in women&apos;s earnings would affect this figure as follows:Increase in women1s Addition toAddition to women&apos;s      Earnings as proportion National wage and earnings of men&apos;s earnings salary bill16%, from 60$   to   70/2 j/o25% &quot;     GOfo   to   13% 5%to   QQ% 7%9.    The hourly earnings of women clerical officers in the non-industrial CivilService, who get equal pay, is 80 per cent of the pay of men.   It is usual forwomen&apos;s earnings, even following the introduction of equal pay, to be less thanmen*s.   In this case the reason was probably that women were at lower points onthe incremental scale than men.   In other cases, women may work shorter hoursthan men or, where the figures apply to groups of occupations, the women may bein occupations of lower grade, on average, than men.   Another example from theU.K. is the gas and electricity industries where, following the introduction of equal pay for non-manua.l workers, women&apos;s hourly earnings went up to 75 per cent of men&apos;s.   Eor local authority clerks and bus conductors, where equal pay alsoapplies, women&apos;s hourly earnings are 75 and 95 per cent respectively of men&apos;s./10.   Abroad,
10. Abroad, we can draw on experience in the Common Market countries since theintroduction of equal pay there.   The figures are as follows:-Female hourly earnings expressed as a percentage of male hourly earnings in all industries excluding_agriculture _France Germany United Kingdom1953 85.2 60.4 61.81955 87.5 60.0 60.51957 85 A 61.9 60.21959 84.7 64.0 60.91961 84.7 66.9 60.11963 83.9 67.8 60.31965 83.1 68.1 59.51967 83.5 69.3 59.7Source: I.L.O. Yearbook.Thus, in Germany, where the introduction of equal pay depends on the post-warConstitution and a number of court decisions, the ratio increased from 60 percent (about the same as the present ratio in Britain) in 1955 to almost70 per cent in 1967.   In France equal pay legislation was introduced after thewar.   The high ratio in France, which may be affected by the social securitysystem there did not increase between 1953 and 1967.   The following figures areavailable for other countries:-Women1s earnings in manufacturing industries as proportion of men&apos;s earnings1964 1967Italy                                             69.8 73.8Netherlands                                      56.2 59.0Belguim                                          65.3 67.8Luxemb urg                                         45.3 56.7Source: E &amp; P. Gazette, September 1968.The effects of equal pay had almost certainly not worked themselves throughcompletely in these countries by 1967.U.   The German figures are the most instructive.    If German experience were tobe repeated in the U.K.,  it would imply an average increase in women&apos;s earnings of 16 per cent and an addition to the national wage and salary bill of 3 per centThis probably sets a lower limit to the estimates of the cost of introducingequal pay in the U.K.   The figure of 3 per cent is in line with the estimatestoade by the Governments in E.E.C. of the cost of equal pay.    It is also in line/with the
with the cost of introducing equal pay in the non-industrial Civil Service -3.6 per cent.12.   The evidence quoted so far suggests, therefore, that the total cost of introducing equal pay may be anything from 3 per cent to 5 per cent of thenational wage and salary bill.   There are, however, other considerations.While it would not be easy for men doing the same jobs as women to seek to restore their differentials following the introduction of equal pay (thoughways might be found), it is perhaps more likely that there will be pressure from men to maintain existing differentials between occupations which arepredominantly men&apos;s and those which are predominantly women&apos;s.   Even more probably the pay of occupations predominantly carried out by women may not infact improve as much as one tends to assume from the present differentialbetween men and women in these occupations.   Over the period 1970 to 1973money earnings would be expected to rise by perhaps 3 in total.   It is by nomeans certain that in all occupations where the present differential betweenmen and women&apos;s earnings is of the order of 25 per cent that the women onintroduction of equal pay will get both this 25 per cent and the 33 per cent increase in money earnings which would be expected.   The pay of some of theseoccupations where women predominate may in fact increase more slowly than itotherwise would over the period.   For example, it has often argued that pay inteaching has been held down by the existence of equal pay;    and that in theabsence of equal pay male teachers would be getting more than they do now.13.   Similarly there will undoubtedly be a tendency after the introduction ofthe equal pay programme to classify jobs in a way which will leave those whollyor primarily carried out by women at a low rate of pay.   Men will then tend to drop out of these occupations;    or will have to accept a rather low level of pay in them.    In this way the differentials between the major groups of men andwomen may be eroded less than might be expected from the rather high figures forthe increase in women&apos;s earnings which are often predicted.14.   An alternative approach to the making of an estimate of the cost of equal pay is to try and build up a total cost from assumptions about the probable effects in individual occupations and industries.   This is attempted below(paragraphs 17 to 2l).   The basis of these estimates is partly the informationdrawn from the sample Cost Enquiry.   This is used as a basis for the estimates for manufacturing industry, for retail distribution, for catering and to someextent for office workers.   The assumptions about indirect costs are morespeculative and do not pretend to be any more than reasonable judgments about/the probable
the probable outcome.   The total cost built up from these estimates is anincrease in average total earnings of women of about 10 per cent on directeffects and a further 7 per cent for indirect effects.   These would representadditions of 2 per cent and 1-gr per cent respectively to the national wage and salary bill.    In other words, they lead to a figure for total cost of some3g- per cent compared with the upper limit of 5 per cent mentioned earlier.These are estimates of the cost of the increase in women&apos;s earnings.   They donot in general take much account of the points raised in paragraphs 12 and 13which on balance would tend to pull down the cost.15.   We are therefore left with the following position.(i)   An average increase of 25 per cent in women&apos;s earnings representingan   addition of about 5 per cent to the national wage and salary billis the upper limit of the probable cost,(ii)   A build up of the cost from individual occupations and industriessuggests an average increase in women&apos;s earnings amounting to some3^ per cent of the total wage and salary bill,(iii)   A similar or slightly lower figure is suggested by experience inGermany;   which also suggests that the effects operate over a ratherlengthy period.16.   In order to avoid any risk of understating the possible cost, the upperfigure of 5 per cent is used in calculations in subsequent sections except those derived directly from the occupational calculations or calculations for individual industries.   It should be stressed that this is a fairly extremeassumption and that a lower figure is far more likely.A    (ii)   The impact of equal pay in different occupational groups17.   Estimates of the direct and indirect effects of introducing equal pay onthe main occupational groups in which women work are set out in Tables 1 and 2(annexed).   The estimates do not purport to be more than a general indication ofwhat is likely to happen.   The main source of information is the sample enquiry into the cost of equal pay carried out among 230 firms earlier this year.   this enquiry suggested that in manufacturing industry about 60 per cent of the women employed in manual jobs would benefit directly from equal pay and that their pay would, on average, rise by perhaps 30 per cent.    The office workers innanufacturing industry were expected to benefit to a lesser extent both in numbers and in the percentage rise in earnings.   On the other hand, it was assumed that all women in retail distribution would benefit but only a small proportion of those in catering./l8.   The assumptions
18.   The assumptions made by the various employers were not necessarily uniform and may in some cases have been mutually inconsistent.   Certainly there were very large variations in the proportion of women who were expected to benefitdirectly.   However, this is the best information we have as to what people in industry actually believe would happen.19.   As regards indirect effects, it has been assumed that about half the office staff would get increases indirectly in the period with which we are concerned.And that there would be repercussions on the general level of women&apos;s pay bothin occupations like cleaners and in some groups which already have equal paysuch as nurses.   On the other hand, it is not assumed that the increase inthese groups would be as large as the increases secured by those directlybenefiting from equal pay.20.   If these assumptions are anything like correct, the following broadconclusions can be drawn.(a) that manual workers in manufacturing industries will have a largerper cent increase in pay than office workers(b) that office workers will get as large an increase and perhaps larger than a great many of the women employed in service industries(c) that women employed in the service industries which include many ofthe lowest paid groups, are not going to improve their positionrelative to other women;    although their position will still be improved in relation to the general level of male workers.The last conclusion - that many of the lowest paid women are going to benefitleast from equal pay - is important.21,   The estimates made in this section are used in order to calculate theadditional costs industry by industry in the following section.

24.   The following are estimates of the effects on total costs, sector by sector,flowing from the direct effects of introducing equal pay, i.o. the costs ofequalising pay for the same or essentially the same jobs:Table 3Direct effects of equal pay on total costs(not allowing for inter sector repercussions)SectorAgricultureFuel (coal, gas, electricity &amp; water)ConstructionManufacturingEngineeringChemicalsTextilesClothingFood and drinkDistributive tradesTransportFinancial, professional &amp; scientificservicesOther servicesPublic Administration *Increases in wage and sala,ry billNegligible3.A-Negligible120710Negligible^21NegligibleTotal*&amp;ee top 0f i3iiowing pageEffects ontotal costsNegligible41*Negligible27i51Negligible2h3.4Negligible1^/This22.   Tills section examines the probable effects of equal pay on total costs in different industries and services.     Not all parts will be equally affected.Some already have equal pay.    Some employ a small proportion of women, some alarge proportion.    In some, labour costs form a much larger proportion oftotal costs than in others,23.   In addition to the increases in their own labour costs, industries will ofcourse be faced with increases in the prices of bought materials and componentsfrom other industries with increases in costs as the result of equal pay; and increased charges for many services.    Only a complete &quot;input-output&quot; calculationcould produce an analysis of the detailed repercussions through the economy.This would be a considerable task and it is &quot;unlikely that existing data wouldenable it to be carried out satisfactorily.   The following figures do not allow for repercussions from one sector to another.
* This is Public Administration as defined in the Standard IndustrialClassification.   Workers employed in national and local government areclassified to Public Administration only if they cannot be classified toanother industrial group.   Thus, for example, building workers employed bya government department or local authority are classified to the construction industry.   Most workers classified to Public Administration are non-manualswho already get equal pay.   Manual workers employed in national and localgovernment, who are generally classified to other industrial groups, do notbut theyget equal pay.   H. M. Forces        do not get equal pay/are not included inthe Table.25.   The following table gives estimates of the increase in total costs flowingfrom both the direct and indirect effects of equal pay.   This table also includes an allowance for increased employe is&apos;.-contributions to the national insurance Fund.   From 1972 these contributions will take the form of a pay rolltax of, say, 7 per cent.   Thus, if the wage bill increases by 5 per cent,contributions will increase by 7 per cent of 5 per cent equals 0.35 per cent.Assuming that SET takes the same percentage of the wage and salary bills of non-exempt/mployers as at present (11%), equal pay will also have the effect ofincreasing tax payments by affected employers by about  43 million   or about .2% of the national wage and salary bill.   The figures are as follows:-Table 4Direct and indirect effects of equal pay on total costs(not allowing for inter sector repercussions but including an allowance for increased National Insurance contributions and SET)Sector	Number of Vi/omen	Increases in women&apos;s Pay	Increases in labour costs (inc, N.I. costs &amp; SET)	Effects on total costs	Thousands	 m	%	%Agriculture	75	6	If	1 2Fuel (coal, gas, elect-ricity and water)	75	Negligible	Negligible	NegligibleConstruction	90	12	3 4-	-i 4Manufacturing	2700	400	51	3Distributive trades	1540	200	ll 	6fTransport	270	Negligible	Negligible	NegligibleFinancial, professional &amp; scientific services	2125	90	4-2	Other services	1180	75	3	HPublic administration	435	Negligible	Negligible	NegligibleTotal	8500	say 800	4 *	3*This is made up of 3^ due to increased pay, \ per cent due to increased N.I.contributions and 1/5 per cent due to increased S.E.T.
26.   Within these sectors there would bo a fair amount of variation from oneindustry to another, largely depending on:(a) the proportion of women employed(b) the extent of equal pay already (a total of about 1-g- million workers get equal pay already)(c) the extent to which groups already receiving equal pay getincreases springing from increases in other industries and   (d)    the importance of labour costs in total costs.27.   The enquiry into the cost of equal pay among a sample of firms showsthat industries such as clothing manufacture, pottery and (to a lessorextent) food manufacturing, would be particularly affected.    They might have anincrease in total costs 1-g- - 2 times greater than the average for manufacturing industry.    (They are also industries which foresaw the greatest need to changepractices in female employment.)28.   In the distribution sector, retail distribution would be worse affectedthan wholesaling arid transport.   And some service industries such as laundrieswould be worse affected than others (again twice the average for the sector).29.   On the other hand, the fuel sector would hardly be affected at all.Agriculture and construction would be very little affected (except from therise in costs of bought in goods and services).   And public administration and public sector professions such as nurses and teachers would only beaffected by the consequences of rises in women1s pay in industries competingfor the same labour.30.   Within industries individual firms would be affected to a varying degree.The range shown in the sample survey for the increase in labour costs fromraising all women&apos;s pay except those already enjoying men&apos;s rates weretypically as follows:Potteries	I+   -	26%Pood	2   -	Engineering	1   -	Laundries	10   -	16%However, the extreme variations may conceal some differences in the basis of calculation as well as lack of coherence in the industrial group.   Laundrieswhich are both a coherent group and carried out their calculations on acommon basis show a limited range of variation.
31.   After taking account of the spread of costs through the economy (due torepercussions from sector to sector) there will remain variations in the effects of equal pay on total costs but they will not be so great as the figures inTable 4 suggest.
CONFIDENTIALQ,    The effect of price structures and   Government expenditure32.   Taking the economy as a whole, an increase of 5.5 per cent in labour costs(made up of an increase of 5.0 per cent in pay and 0.5 per cent in N.I.contributions and S.E0T0) would give rise to an increase of 4.0 per cent in total costs.     If it can be assumed that profits increase broadly in proportion to theincrease in total costs, the general price level will also rise by 4.0 per cent.The relationship between increasing labour costs and &apos;.rising prices suggested bythese figures is normal, the difference being largely accounted for by import prices which would not, of course, be affected by the introduction of equal pay.33.   The estimated increase in total costs of 4.0 per cent assumes that theintroduction of equal pay will not have any substantial effect on the level of output per head from the female labour force.       This is a doubtful assumption.There is little d*doubt that at present, in some employments, female labour is used extremely wastefully because of the extreme cheapness with which much of itcan he obtained.     A sharp increase in women&apos;s rates of pay is, almost certainly,likely to lead to employers generally seeking to get more effective work from them.The abolition of pay differentials between men and women should make it easier touse female labour with less regard to current demarcation lines.     In areas suchas retail distribution and catering there will be an intensification of the presentattempts to economise in the use of labour.       The Introduction of equal pay willin this respect further intensify the pressure on the service industries.     Itwould be reasonable to assume therefore that in practice the output per head ofthe female labour force will improve and that this will offset some of theadditional costs involved.     It is quite impossible to put any estimate on this in advance.      The further material in this Note therefore takes the figure of4 per cent as representing the effect on price levels.     However, this is a maximumfigure and in all probability 3 per cent would be a more reasonable figure to take.34. The increases will, of course, not be spread evenly over the whole economy.The sector by sector analysis of the increase in total costs in Table 4 (thoughit does not allow for inter-sector repercussions) suggests the following:-(i)   The increase in costs in manufacturing industry is likely to be prettyaverage, taking the sector as a whole.       There will, however, be certain industries such as clothing manufacture and to a lesser extent foodmanufacture where the increase will be substantially greater than the average.
(ii)   Because there are proportionately more women employed and costs will rise more in retail distribution than in the rest of distribution, the sales prices of goods in the shops might rise by a little nure than pricesgenerally.     OV; the other hand, the pressure of competition at the retaillevel may cause economies to be made to offset the cost of equal pay and bring the rise in retail prices more into line with the general rise inprices, i.e. 4 per cent.     And, of course, the retail prices of imported goods will be affected only by the increased cost of distribution in theUoK0(iii)   Food stuffs (excluding manufactured food stuffs of certain kinds)will be less affected.     Home farming is not much affected and what effectthere is will be as much on the farm subsidy bill as on retail prices.Imported food will be affected only by the increase in distribution costs.(iv)   The fuel sector of the economy, including coal, gas and electricity,will be affected very little.(v)   Transport will not be significantly affected since there will be a negligible increase in direct labour costs and fuel used by the transport industry will not be significantly affected either.(vi)   The public sector will be affected less than others because of theextent to which equal pay has already been introduced in this area.     It is,however, difficult to predict the extent to which the increase in women&apos;earnings generally may affect the pay of those groups in the public sectoralready enjoying equal pay.     However, the total impact on public expenditure seems likely to be less than that on the economy as a whole.The estimates in   Table 4 do not cover H.M. Forces where the introductionof equal pay would cost  1^-2 million.35.   Even within the various sectors there will, however, be very largedifferences in impact from one firm to another.       This is because some firms atpresent employ a much larger proportion of women than others.     One result of equal pay may well be that women will be distributed rather more evenly over the economy than in the past.      At present there is undoubtedly a tendency for somefirms to make use of low paid but also low productivity women workers.     It isby no means certain that costs are necessarily reduced by this process.     Ifwomen&apos;s earnings are relatively higher, these firms will be persuaded to try andHake more use of male labour or increase the efficiency with which they use theirfemale labour.
36.   Nevertheless, there will undoubtedly be some firms where the cost of introducing equal pay does make their position particularly difficult.     Thisis obviously the case in some of the clothing firms where, according to thesample enquiry, increases in total labour- costs in excess of     3 seem quite possible.       A similar position v/as said to exist in some of the electronicsfirms using large numbers of women for assembly work and where labour costs bulkhigh in the total.     However, many of the estimates assume that one movesdirectly to a position of equal pay over a short period thus allowing little timefor adaptation.     It is to be expected that many firms in this position wouldtake steps to change the situation over a period of five or six years.37.   In general the differences in relative costs and prices throughout the economy caused by the introduction of equal pay, to the extent they derive fromthe sample enquiry, are almost certainly overstated in the estimates in   Table 3.In the end the effect is likely to be much more uniform than might be expected from the estimates which can be made at present, both between firms and as betweenvarious sectors of industry.
D.    Effect on the balance of payments38,  We have not taken into account in the following paragraphs any reper-cussions on the balance of payments position which might follow directly fromthe mere announcement that equal pay was to be introduced.39,   The effect on the balance of payments from a rise in costs takes the formof reducing the demand for exports and increasing the demand for imports.   Theeffect is subject to about two years&apos; time lag and tends to be progressive astine goes on.   The latest estimate suggests that the cost to the balance ofpayments in 1975 might be some  350 million if total earnings rise between1970 and 1975 by 5 per cent following equal pay and  200 million if they riseby only 3 per cent.   This would not, however, be the final effect - whichcould be as much as  650 million by 1977 (or  350 million in the lower case).40.   The distribution of tho increased costs through the economy could varythis estimate.   In so far as costs in manufacturing rise less than the average,the effect on the balance of payments would be smaller. - But, on our present information, it looks as if tho average increase in costs in manufacturing maybe fairly close to the average for the whole economy.41.   There is also the question how far the main individual exporting industries would be affected to varying degrees.   This only matters if the industries most &apos;iaffected have a high price-elasticity of demand for their products overseas.On balance it seems doubtful if the point would much affect the inevitablyrough estimates.42.   On the import side, costs of clothing manufacture would increase sharply.It night be argued there will be a substantial increase in cheap clothingimports.   However costs of manufacture are a low proportion of sales prices.43.   Otherwise it is difficult to see any major effects on import/export ofparticular industries.44*   The estimates given in paragraph 39 for the effect on the balance of pay-nents of the introduction of equal pay and particularly the figures for anincrease in labour costs of 5 per cent, are so large that it is perhaps worthre-enphasizing the nature of the assumptions which have been used at various points earlier in this paper.(i)   The estimate of 5 per cent assumes that on average all women inthe country receive an increase of 25 per cent in their pay.Both experience on the Continent and the detailed estimate forprobable increases in the main occupational groups would producesignificantly lower figures than 25 per cent.
,.;13r(ii)   It is assumed that equal pay will involve a steady rise in total earnings at the rate of 1 per cent a year for 5 years.If the increase was to be less than 1 per cent in the early part of the period the effect on the balance of payments by1975 would be lower than the figures in paragraph 39.   It isvery probable that the increase in earnings would be less inthe early part of the period since employers and unions wouldtake time to negotiate agreed phased programmes and indirectcosts xrould come later rather than earlier.   All the estimatesassume that the full indirect costs of equal pay in its effects on women workers who are not themselves entitled to equal paywill have worked their way into the economy by 1975.   There mustbe a strong presumption that there would be a time lag before this in fact happened and this is strongly suggested by theContinental experience.   Up to 1 per cent of the Increase in labour costs could occur after 1975.(iii)   The estimates assume that employers do not react to the increasein women!s pay by seeking to re-organise their activities so that output per woman worker rises to offset the higher pay.   This is most implausible particularly in sectors where large numbers ofwomen are employed.   If the average output per head of women workers rose by 5 per cent over the next 6 years this would off-set &quot;/5 of the  additional labour costs to employers.(iv)   The estimates assume that the increase in costs in the export industries, which are largely manufacturing industries, willbe the same as the increase in costs in manufacturing as a whole and, therefore, as it happens, about the same as the increase in costs in the economy as a whole.   A more detailed analysisindustry by industry might show that the increase in costs inthe export industries was below that for the economy as a whole.The data are not available to make such an analysis, but the direct effects alone of equal pay on costs are lower in engineer-ing, chemicals and textiles - all important export industries -than in the economy as a whole.45.   The consequences of equal pay for the balance of payments based on a 5per cent figure are affected by all the four assumptions listed above.   Thefigures based on an increase in labour costs of 3 per cent relax the firstassumption but the other three remain unaltered.   If the lower figure of 3 per cent for the final cost of equal pay were taken and allowances made forthe time lag, for employers responses, and for a possibly lower than average figure for export industries, the lower figure of  200 million in paragraph39 for the effect on the balance of payments in 1975 would be significantly reduced.cNFD-S3NTALA6.
4,6.  A. factor working in the opposite direction is the assumption that theincrease in men&apos;s pay over the period to 1975 is unaffected by the increasein women&apos;s pay.   This is, of course, uncertain.   It is possible that someunions would press for larger increases in men&apos;s pay to maintain differen-tials.   It is also possible that employers faced with the cost of equal pay would be tougher in general negotiations.   No figure can.be put on thisuncertain element in the calculations.47.   There is one other consideration.   The estimates in paragraph 39 ofthe effects of equal pay on the balance of payments are made on the assumption of higher average earnings at a constant pressure of demand.   On this ass-umption any benefit to the balance of payments arising because of an increasein the output per head of women workers (see paragraph 44 (iii)) would be offset to a significant but unquantifiable extent by the rise in production(and therefore imports) which would ensue.   If this assumption of a constant pressure of demand is relaxed, then to the extent that price increases lagbehind the earnings increases associated with equal pay, the deterioration in the balance of payments will be larger than is indicated in paragraph 39.
E.  Effects on employment and unemployment48.   Since the relation between women&apos;s and men&apos;s earnings has remainedextremely stable over decades it might be thought that an increase of perhaps25 per cent over 5 years in women1 s earnings in relation to men&apos;s would leadto substantial changes in the patterns of employment, with possible impli-cations for the level of industrial efficiency.   The introduction of S.E.T.in 1966 which raised relative labour costs in services by considerably lossthan 25 per cent immediately reversed the continuing upward trend in employ-ment in the taxed sectors.   Although the introduction of equal pay would bespread over a longer period, it would be unwise not to expect some check inthe growth of employment opportunities for women.   The extent of such a checkis a matter of conjecture but there are grounds for thinking that it wouldnot lead to a substantial increase in unemployment.49.   la principle one would expect employers to react to the higher rates of pay for women in two wayss(a) by being more ready to employ men in jobs which are now carriedout largely by women(b) by raising the output of female labour and, in particular, by substituting capital for women 1s labour especially in labourintensive jobs, e.g. introducing new packing machinery in factories, or speeding up the change to self-service in retail distribution.50,   The first reaction - replacing women by men - would be significant if,generally speaking, female workers were less productive than male workers andthe present differences in pay were a reflection of this fact.   Then, theequalisation of pay might be expected to result in an increase in men13employment and a decrease in women&apos;s employment.   The evidence fromindustries in this country which have introduced equal pay and from exper-ience in Western Europe does not suggest that this will in fact happen toany important extent.   In other words, women&apos;s pay in the great majorityof cases is held artificially low by conventional factors in the processof pay settlements.51.   It is about the second reaction that there is most uncertainty.   Itseems likely that the rise in women&apos;s pay would make profitable some mechan-isation which at present is not quite worth undertaking and some firms inthe sample enquiry said this would happen.   While this would mean some lossof resources only a small proportion of any labour so released wouldregister as unemployed.
52.   In general the increase in labour costs should not be so large as to drive many firms out of business.   There may be a few exceptions to this.(A few clothing firms nay face increases in total labour costs of 30 percent.)53.   Inquiries made in Western Europe in 1966 indicated that the countries concerned had not observed any significant effects on employment or unemploy-raent of women during the introduction of equal pay, though progress towardsthe full implementation of equal pay in most of these countries seems to havebeen slower than we are envisaging in the United Kingdom.5A.   A rise in women&apos;s pay might be expected to result in an increase in thenumber of women seeking employment.   Here again there is no observ- -r.Minformation one way or the other.   Some employers believe that married womenhave a &quot;target&quot; for their earnings and are likely to seek to reduce theirhours of work if they can reach it more easily as a result of equal pay.   Onthe other hand, it can be argued that higher earnings will make it more worth-while for married women to incur the costs involved in work (travelling costs,domestic assistance, etc.), or will increase the reluctance of married women to leave employment because of the larger drop in family income which would follow.55.   On balance the probable effects on employment seem unlikely to be sign-ificant in the economy as a whole, though the overall effect is likely to bean increase in the number of women available for employment and decrease inthe growth of job opportunities.A.
56.   Although the previous section suggests that in general the effects of equal pay on the employment of women are unlikely to be significant it isnecessary to consider whether there are likely to be special problems in theDevelopment Areas.     It is in these Areas if anywhere that the classicalresponse to a rise in the cost of labour is likely to be seen.57.   Since unemployment levels are significant in these Areas the possibilityof substituting male for female workers is more real than in other parts ofthe country.     Moreover, any woman displaced would be less likely to findanother job, particularly since opportunities for female labour are generallyless and the activity rate for women in some of theso Areas is below thenational average of 40 per cent (Wales 30 per cent, Northern 35 per cent).And if firms go out of business altogother the workers - both men and women -would be less likely to find new jobs.58.   The Department of Economic Affairs has therefore examined whether thereare industries in the Development Areas whose costs are likely to be particularlyseriously affected by the introduction of equal pay.     These seem likely to beindustries which employ in the Development Areas an above average proportionof the female labour force and which are also likely to find a particularlysubstantial effect on their costs arising from equal pay.     In the northern region, clothing manufacture, retail distribution and hotels and cateringcome within this group.     Although it is perhaps unlikely that many firmseven in these industries would actually be forced out of business by thehigher costs associated &quot;with equal pay there could well be some shedding offemale labour from these industries.     In Wales and Scotland there is also an above average proportion of women employed in distribution.     Here againmoves to self service and other economies in labour could be speeded up.59-   There is no special reason to think that firms in Development Areas are on balance less profitable or less efficient than those elsewhere.     Nor dothey seem more likely to be forced out of business, nor to drastic laboureconomies than firms in other parts of the country.     The D.E.A. thereforedo not consider that there is likely to be any greatly disproportionateeffect upon employment in Development Areas from the introduction of equal pay.     If, however, firms do reduce the number of women employed it is possiblethat they will find it more difficult to obtain other jobs in Development Areas/ thancoNFDNAL
than, elsowhere.    However, even this could bo offset by tho fact that there arelikely to be increased opportunities for the employment of women in development areas over the next few years.     The number of jobs available to women isexpected to increase by over 5 per cent in Development Areas between 1966 and1975 whereas in other parts of the country the increase is negligible.60.   There has been no suggestion from enquiries made in western Europe thatthe introduction of equal pay has been accompanied by any special problems infemale employment in areas corresponding to the Development Areas in thiscountry.61.   On the whole, the effect of efual pay on employment in the development areas is unlikely to be significantly different from the effect elsewhere inthe country.G.   Effects] -on^o-cial sjsjsurjL^js^stejn
&amp;.    Effects on social security system62.   The introduction of equal pay will have certain direct effects on thesocial   security system;   and may have indirect effects.     For practical purposes it has been judged best to assess these effects on the situation asit will be after the new earnings-related pensions and social insurance schemes planned for 1972 have been introduced..63.   Under the new schemes all v/omen including all married ivomen in employment will be paying about 65 per cent of their earnings in contributions.     Andtheir   employers will be paying a contribution (including Redundancy Fundpayments) of about 6^ per cent of their total pay roll.64.   If women&apos;s earnings increase by 25 per cent following equal pay andtheir employer&apos;s total labour costs by 5 per cent, there will therefore bean additional increase in total wage and salary costs due to increasedemployers&apos; contributions to the National Insurance Fund, of -g per cent.65.   The total amount of earnings-related benefits drawn by women from theFund   will be increased.     However, in the short-run at any rate, theD.H.S.S. would expect increased contributions (by women and their employers)to offset the increase in payments.66.   The rise in prices following from the cost of equal pay vri.ll require some additional increases in the rate of benefits to maintain their purchasingpower (an extra 1+ per cent over 5 years).     The changes would not in themselvesbe so large as to lead to a real risk that benefits would have to be raisedmore frequently than at two-yearly intervals.67.   A possible effect of equal pay would be pressure for an increase in family allowances (and/or children&apos;s tax allowances) to improve the householdincomes of married men with children who will be relatively worse off as aresult of equal pay.     There are other possible consequences, but so far as can be foreseen they are of a minor nature./H.   Effects on

An increase in the earnings of women relative to men means that alarger proportion of the increase in national income will accrue to thosefamilies with women workers, and a smaller proportion to families with onlya male breadwinner.69.   Since equal pay will be introduced over- a five year period during whichthe level of earned incomes will probably rise by 15% in real terms, thereis no reason why any sections of the community in receipt of earned incomes should actually be worse off.   But some will be less well off than theyotherwise would be.70.   An attempt to assess the magnitude of the possible switch involved hasbeen made on the following assumptions:(a) that earnings of women rise on average by 25%(b) that the total wage bill rises by 5%(c) that this leads to a price rise of 1$Rough estimates of the numbers of households with various combinations of wage-earners have been made on the basis of a small sample from the FamilyExpenditure Survey.   The following table shows the changes to be expectedas compared with the position without equal pay.   The position of householdswith female workers will differ according to whether they have already gotequal pay or not.   Ones with equal pay will be in the sane position as house-holds with only male workers.
71.   ft&apos;are households will be worse off than will be better off.   However,households with male workers only will not actually be worse off in 1975.They will, in fact,.be about 11% better off than in 1970.   But the rise intheir standard of living will be only about 2 per cent a year instead of 3 per cent a year.72.   The households with no workers are mainly old age pensioners, widows andthe unemployed.   Perhaps 85 per cent of them will be largely dependent on social security payments; and these would presumably be raised to cover theincrease in the cost of living.   They would not therefore be worse off inpractice.   However, the increase in benefits would have to come out of the incomes of other groups and would reduce other household incomes by % percent over this period.   Households with no workers, which are mainly dependenton occupational pensions, would suffer the full impact of the 2$ general risein prices.73.   Many forms of financial assistance from national and local governmentare means-tested, e.g. rent and rate rebates and school meals.   eligibility for these is, of course, affected by increases in earnings arising from all sources.   But an increase in women&apos;s earnings would particularly affect house-holds where women were the sole earners./I.
I.    Effects on incomes policy74.   The next incomes policy White Paper will have to take into account any immediate national programme to implement equal pay.   The main question whicharises is whether equal pay increases should be kept within the norm of 3g$or allowed to be superimposed on it.   If the introduction of equal pay werephased over a five-year period, the increase in the annual wage and salarybill would be equivalent to an increase of 1% in each of the five years onthis account along.   This is an amount which could be expected to fullyoffset the estimated dampening effects on earnings of incomes policy, atany rate as it has operated in the past.75.   In order to avoid the inflationary effects of equal pay, it would benecessary to reduce other increases to men and women allowed under the incomes policy below what they might otherwise have been.   Three possible alternatives would be:(i)   to reduce the norm to 2g- per cent in which case increases on equal pay grounds could be allowed on top of the norm, i.e.equal pay would be   criterion justifying above norm increases,(ii)   to retain a norm of 3k per cent but to insist that equal pay increases must cone out of the norm, i.e. the increases granted by an employer to his men and women enployees nust not in total,in the normal case, exceed 3k per cent.   There would be nocriterion justifying above norm increases on equal pay grounds.This is open to the obvious objection that it would not providefor the position of industries and firns where the introductionof equal pay is going to add nore than 5 per cent to their totalwage and salary bill,(iii)   to compronise and reduce the norn to 3 per cent, equal pay increases providing justification for above norm increases.From the point of view of the incomes policy as such even anorm of 3k per cent, will not be easy to hold and obviously thedifficulty would be enhanced with a norm of 3 per cent.None of these possibilities seem to be practical; the introduction of a normof 2]? or 3 per cent for men, whether implicit or explicit, is probably out ofthe question in the current incomes policy climate.   The T.U.C. have alreadyHade it clear that they reject any abatement in increases for men on accountof equal pay.   In the 1969 T.U.C. Economic Review (p.43) there is thefollowing passage on one of the factors which would make a settlement abovenormal level suggested by the T.U.C. acceptable:/&quot;(d)
&quot;(d)   where substantial progress is sought towards the establishmentof equal pay;   the General Council will expect this item to be distinguished from other parts of the claim and will treat eachpart on its own merits.&quot;Moreover, some groups of workers may reject equal pay outright, and anyimposed abatement of increases for men in these cases might lead to industrial disruptions.   The balance of probabilities is, therefore, thatthe inflationary consequences of equal pay will in practice have to beaccepted in full.76.   The introduction of equal pay would have other possible implications for the incomes policy;(i)   an announcement that a phased programme for implementingequal pay was to be introduced might add to the impression of a weakening of the incomes policy In the next phase and make it that much more difficult to ensure that increases in incomes generally were subject to restraint.(ii)   to the extent that men seek to maintain their differentialsas women&apos;s pay is increased, settlements will be that much larger than they might otherwise have been*   If a fewimportant settlements were to be affected in this way, theycould set the tone for a rather higher level of increaseacross the whole economy.
