PUBLIC EXPENDITURE;    1971-72 to 1973-7/4Ministers have instructed us to carry forward work on public expenditure in 1971-72, revising the figures to take account of the reductions and increases agreed for 1970-71, so that decisions on1971-72 may &quot;be taken in September (C.C. (69)38th Meeting, Conclusion(19)).2,    This Report is submitted to Ministers accordingly.    It isset out in three stages(i)   the expenditure^1^ programmes as they now stand;(ii)   the economic objectives;(iii)   methods of eliminating the imbalance.3,    The report is primarily concerned with 1971-72, for which firm decisions are needed in the current Survey.    It also looks forward to the last two years of the Survey period, 1972-73 and 1973-74, forwhich Ministers are asked to give broad guidance for planning purposes.   As agreed by Ministers, and proposed in the April green paper on Public ExpenditureC2), figures for all five years of the survey period, with the two later years suitably differentiated,fill be published in the first of the new White Papers on public expenditure before the end of the calendar year.The Programmes as they now standki    Table 1 below gives the latest estimates for public expenditurein 1970-71 to 1973-74, and compares these with the estimatesoriginally reported for the 1969 Public Expenditure Survey(SEP(69)6lj.).   The latest estimates for 1970-71 reflect the reductions in programmes which Ministers have already approved for that year(C.C.(b9)38th Conclusions), together with some further (relatively small) changes reported by Departments since the Survey Report*as completed.   Similarly the estimates for 1971-72 and later yearstake in the consequential effects of Ministers&apos; decisions on1970-71, so far as these have yet been established^) t together withthe other changes.(1) This Report is throughout concerned with public expenditure,excluding debt interest.(2) &quot;The Government now propose that there should ^ Published ^towards the end of each calendar y!Jr.a/^^rnm^nt fBpresent to Parliament the results of the ^ nment S()consideration of the prospect for public expenditure.(Cmnd. 4017, paragraph 5)(3) For details see Table A.1

Thfi Economic Objectives5,    The Report on the medium-term economic outlook (S.E.P.(69)66)showed a prospective imbalance in the economy in 1971-72 amounting to between  250 million (in its Basic Case I) and  450 million (in itsBasic Case II).    That Report suggested that it would be appropriate forlinisters to base&apos; their consideration of the public expenditure programmes on Basic Case II.    The present Report suggests that it wouldbe consistent with the decisions which Ministers have meanwhile takenin respect of 1970-71, and with the latest view of the medium-term economic prospect, if Ministers were to take a middle line between thetwo Cases, for the purpose of deciding the public expenditure programmes for 1971-72.   This Report therefore proceeds on the assumption thatlinisters will wish to reduce expenditure by  350 million in demand terms.6,    In expenditure terms this implies reductions of between  400 and 500 million, the precise point within this range depending on thedemand content of the particular reductions which Ministers eventuallyselect.   For practical purposes, in considering the reductions requiredin individual programmes, this Report takes a middle figure of 450 million.7,    Reductions of expenditure of this order would, serve to moderatethe rate of increase in the total of Civil and Defence programmes between1970-71 and 1971-72, from the present estimate of 4.6% to a figure inthe region of 3%.   This is the total of expenditure in respect of whichthe Government has stated, as its planning assumption, that the rate of growth should be broadly in line with the growth of resources as a whole.Bringing in the nationalised industries, whose capital expenditure would fall slightly between the two years, overall public expenditure would show an increase between 1970-71 and 1971-72 of 2.7%.Methods of eliminating the prospective imbalance8,    In planning for a reduction of  450 million in public expenditure,as compared with the programmes reported for the 1969 Survey, theI following main aspects fall to be considered:-(a) the carry-through from the 1970-71 decisions (paragraph 9 below)(b) an overall squeeze on expenditure(paragraphs 10 to 17);(c) the Rate Support Grant negotiations (paragraph 11);(d) the costed options identified for 1971-72 in the 1969 SurveyReport (paragraphs 18 and 19);(e) Social security (paragraph 19).9-    The carry-through from 1970-71:   The effect of Ministers&apos; decisions1970-71, together with the other minor changes reported since the1969 Survey Report, has been to reduce the expenditure projections by*1o2 million -  79 million for Civil Programmes and  103 million for nationalised industries.Overall squeeze on expenditure;    One method of approach, whichIJinisters may wish to consider,   is an overall squeeze on expenditure ofjwe kind which they have already applied to 1970-71.    There should indeed
be greater scope for savings of this kind in 1971-72, than for thepreceding year.   Since 1971-72 - the &quot;focus year&quot; of the 1969 Survey -is further ahead, a smaller percentage of both current and capitalexpenditure is committed, than was the case for 1970-71 .11.   In particular, it is open to Ministers to determine, for thepurposes of the rate support grant negotiations in the autumn of 1970,the rate of growth in local authority current expenditure that theywill assume in fixing grant.    (This contrasts with the position inrespect of 1970-71 for which year the rate of increase has alreadybeen determined and announced in the course of the rate support grant negotiations in the autumn of 1968). The scope for savings in public expenditure in 1971-72 by comparison with the present forecasts isexamined in detail in Annex I.   The relevant local authority programmes in 1971 -72 are at present projected by departments to increase by 5*2%over the levels already approved by Ministers in the rate support grant negotiations for 1970-71 .    It is suggested that this increase should belimited to h% overall.   On the assumption that local authoritiesrestrain their actual expenditure to this level, this would yieldsavings of  35 million.12.   For the purposes of illustration, officials have drawn upin Tables B and G at the end of the report an indication of how atotal expenditure reduction of  1+50 million might be secured by an overall squeeze of this kind.    In these illustrative examples it hasbeen assumed that:-(i)    savings of  200 million would be possible in the capitalexpenditure of the nationalised industries and in theDefence Budget, taken together.    This includes thereduction of  103 million in nationalised industries&apos;expenditure which has already been secured as a resultof the 1970-71  decisions.   A study of the possibilityof further reductions in this investment is being made.In addition to the substantial savings on the defence budget which would be required to meet the defence shareof the  200 million, some  25 million will have to befound to provide for the introduction of the militarysalary.   Allowing for this, the total reduction in defence expenditure which is being assumed is about three times as large as the average percentage cut required in civilprogrammes.    The extent to which this assumed reduction will prove possible without yet another Defence Review is being-examined.(ii)    The remaining  250 million for the civil programmes has beenapportioned on two alternative bases.   The scheme set outin Table B at the end of this report assumes that these reductions might be distributed on the same patternas for 1970-71*   Table C assumes a flat rate percentagecut in the civil programmes of some lf%.13.  The scheme, set out in Table B, by its nature, carries forwardinto 1971-72 the preferential treatment for the Social service programmes, which Ministers agreed for 1970-71 .   In particular itpoints to relatively small cuts for Education and no reduction in social Security.   As a consequence, relatively large reductions emerge&quot;or the Economic and Environmental programmes, notably Housing.
III.,   Table B also shows how much of the reduction indicated for eachfunctional programme has already been secured as a result of the carry through from the 1970-71  decisions.    Talcing credit for this carry-through, the total reductions remaining to be found are  171 million.The apportionment of this total between the individual functionalprogrammes is shown in column (6) of Table B.    It will be seen that most of the relatively small reduction indicated for Education is secured by the carry through from 1970-71 .   By contrast most of the relatively large reduction indicated for Housing still remains to befound; this is largely because the reduction which Ministers agreed for housing in 1970-71  included a significant element from slippage in the investment programme for that year, which is not at present expected to occur in 1 971 -72.15.   The alternative scheme of reductions in Table G again assumes thatsavings of  200 million will be possible in the nationalised industries and defence, taken together.    But it then goes on to apportion theremaining  250 million between civil programmes, on the basis of a flat rate percentage cut of just under lf$.   By contrast with the schemeset out in Table B it would require much larger reductions in social security and Education, but much smaller cuts in Housing, Roads,Transport and Assistance to Industry.16.   It is emphasised that the schemes in both Tables B and C are intended solely to illustrate, on arbitrary but neutral assumptions,two schemes which could be made to yield the total indicated savings of  1+50 million.   In considering the scope for reductions in 1971-72,Ministers will no doubt wish to form their own judgement, taking intoaccount the options which are now available for 1971 -72, and the extentto which these differ from those available for 1970-71 , - for example,in the scope to operate on current as well as capital expenditurethrough the Rate Support Grant negotiations.17*   To assist Ministers in this consideration, Departments have set outin Annex II some brief notes of the implications for the majorfunctional programmes of the illustrative schemes of reductionscontained in Tables B and C.18.   Costed Options; In considering an overall squeeze on expenditure,Ministers will have available, to help implement the patterns of reductions illustrated in Tables B and C, the&quot;costed options&quot; for1971-72 which were identified in the 19^9 Public Expenditure Survey -to the extent that these have not, either been subsumed in thecarry-through from 1970-71 decisions, or explicitly rejected in thecourse of the Ministerial discussions on that year.    Typically, thesecosted options represent a reduction of 3 per cent in the expenditure programmes concerned.&apos;9.   In one particular instance - social security - exercise of the1969 Survey costed options would represent a partial alternative tothe overall squeeze on expenditure illustrated in Tables B and C.Ministers agreed not to reduce the outlay on social security benefits in 1970-71 .   But the timing of the next biennial uprating in 1 971Provides greater scope for including social security with the other public expenditure programmes in the search for possible reductions.   a postponement of the October 1971 uprating until April t972 would save*150 million in expenditure terms (worth about  45 million in demand terms),   it would however increase expenditure by about  80 million in1972-73 and  i+o minion in 1 973-74.
20. Summary of the position for 1971-72. Table 2 below summarises the possibilities for consideration by Ministers in achieving areduction of  h50m. in the expenditure programme for 1971-72.TABLE 2;    POSSIBILITIES FOR CONSIDERATION BY MINISTERS(a) Total to be sought(b) Towards which:Savings assumed on defence Budget and nationalised IndustriesCarry through from 1970-71for civil programmes, andother changes  million at 1969 Survey pricesk5020079279(a)(c)   Other savings required in Civil Programmes:-(of which Local Authorities&apos;current expenditure,incorporated in section (d)below, in particular lines 1,6, 8 and 9:  35m.)171(d)   Towards which the main new savings on functional programme, aslisted in :-1 .

21.   Table D at the end of this Report shows how the main functionalprogrammes are planned to increase(a) between 1969-70 and 1970-71, as a consequence ofMinisters&apos; decisions on 1970-71(b) between 1970-71 and 1971-72, if the programme for1971-72 were reduced in the ways illustrated in Tables B and CRelative Price Effect22.   The annual percentage rates of increase shown in paragraphs h and7 and in Table D are all derived from projections at a conventionalconstant price basis, and as such are consistent with the form in whichthe Government have hitherto expressed their expenditure targets.But, as explained in the Green Paper &quot;Public Expenditure:   A NewPresentation&quot; (5), projections on a constant price basis will under-state the share of national resources which existing policies willpre-empt at current prices, since, on balance, prices rise faster in th*public sector than in the private sector.   As the 1969 Survey showed(6), when adjusted for this &quot;relative price effect&quot;, the annual ratesof increase in Civil and Defence Programmes are some f per cent higherthan on the unadjusted constant price basis (7).23.  Effect of reductions in 1970-71 and 1971-72.    If the expenditure programmes were reduced, in the way illustrated in Tables B and C, theexpenditure totals and percentage rates of increase in aggregateexpenditure in 1970-71 and 1971-72 would become as follows:TABLE 5:    PUBLIC EXPENDITURE PROGRAMMES AFTER REDUCTIONS SHOWNIN TABLES B AND C1970-71       1971-72Public Expenditure (including thecapital expenditure of the nationalised Industries) million at 1969 Survey prices 18,171 18,661Percentage increasesUnadjusted:Annual 2.5 2.7(of which:Civil and defence programmes (3^ (3)Nationalised Industries)   (-3) (-1)Cumulative 2.5 5.2Adjusted for Relative, Price EffectAnnual 3.3 3.5(of which:Civil and defence programmes Mf) (3f)Nationalised Industries) (-3) (-1 )Cumulative 3*3 6*. 8,f?)

2k.   Thus, even after the expenditure programmes have &quot;been cut, so asto remove the prospective imbalance in the economy, overall public expenditure is still projected to grow rather faster than the economy as a whole; and the public sector is projected to continue toincrease its share of the total national product.   Thus, even thoughthe prospective imbalance may be removed without increasing therates of central government taxation, the projections imply anincrease in the real burden of taxation in 1970-71 and 1971-72,effecting a relative switch of resources, from private to public investment and consumption. This follows inevitably from the impact of constant rates of tax (and tax allowances) on increasing wages and   &apos;;prices.1972-73 and 1973-7425.   If the programmes for 1972-73 and 1973-74 were to be allowed to stand unchanged from their present levels, while those for 1971-72were reduced as shown in Tables B and C, the run of figures shown inparagraph 23 would, continue as follows:-TABLE k; PUBLIC EXPENDITURE IK 1972-75 AND 1975-7U1972-73       1973-74Public Expenditure (includingnationalised industries&apos; investment) million at 1969 Survey prices 19,699 20,1+69Percentage increaseUnadjustedAnnual 5*6 3&apos;9(of which:Civil and defence programmes (k )Nationalised Industries) (19) (5*)Cumulative 5*6 9*7Adjusted for Relative Price EffectAnnual 6.3 k.83(of which:Civil and DefenceProgrammesNationalised Industries) (l9) (5t)Cumulative 6.3 11.4Programmes (5^) (hf)19)^ 1Q79 7^ and 1973-74 could increase very26.

may wish to indicate whether the expenditure reductions, on whichthey have already decided for 1970-71 , and which they are now toconsider for 1971-72, should be carried through into the two later years, so that expenditure as a whole continues to grow broadly in line with the growth of resources as a whole.secret

LOCAL AUTHORITY CURRENT EXPENDITURE - 1971 -721,   Every other year the Government agrees with the local authorities the total of their relevant expenditure which will attract Rate support grant for the next two years, and makes an order prescribing the amounts of grant that will be paid in respect of that expenditure.   These figurescannot then be varied except to take account of cost increases.   The next mainOrder will be in the autumn of 1970 and will deal with the two years1971-72 and 1972-73.2,   There is a local authority element both current and capital, in anumber of functional blocks in the public expenditure survey.    The sumof these current elements v&quot;U (plus some other items, mainly loan charges, which do not appear in any functional block) should corresponds to the total revenue expenditure in the Rate Support Grant Order, thoughthe eventual breakdown of the total among the different services is inthe hands of the local authorities and may differ to some extent from the functional breakdown in the survey.    It is therefore necessary to relatethe decisions which are now to be taken on these items of expenditure in1971-72 to the rate of increase which can be envisaged for localauthority revenue expenditure as a whole.3,   The relevant total figures which emerge from the existing forecastsin the survey are as follows:-  million (at 1969 Survey prices)England &amp; Wales      Scotland     Gt. BritainTotal of localauthority current expenditure infunctional blocksfor 1971-72 2797.2 28h.h 3081 .6$ increase over1970-71 5.1% 5.6$ 5*2%Total adjusted to revenue expenditurebasis (includingloan charges andother adjustments) 3298.h 3*4-8.U 36U6.8$ increase over1970-71 5.1$ 6.6% 5.5%d) Other than rate fund contributions to housing subsidies. Thesedo not attract rate support grant and are excluded from all thefigures in this note.AI-1SECRETANNEX I
I).,     These rates of growth are significantly higher than those for public expenditure as a whole or the growth in the economy.   Asregards individual services, the percentage increase forecast for education, which accounts for over half the total, is inEngland and Wales;    in other cases the figures range from 3*k% for local environmental services to lk% for roads.   For Scottish servicessome of the percentage increases are higher, others lower.5,     It is proposed that local authorities should he given at an appropriate stage an indication of the rate of growth on which theyshould plan.    If local authorities respond fully to a request to restrict the growth for their total revenue expenditure (loan chargesexcluded) to k% in real terms above that approved for Rate support grant in 1970-71, this would, on a G.B. basis, produce a saving in1971-72 of  3k*k million as compared with the survey figure, anda revised total of  3,0h7.2 million.   The saving would have to be broken down as between the functional blocks for the purpose of thepublic expenditure survey.6,    The corresponding increase for 1972-73 forecast in the public expenditure survey is h.h%.    If an increase of k% were decided upon for 1971-72, the same rate of growth could be envisaged for 1972-73,which would give a saving of about  50 million on the survey figure.7.    On this approach the increase in loan charges arising from the levels of capital expenditure approved would be accepted in full on top of the k% increase in other relevant expenditure, and to theextent that loan charges increased at a higher rate, the increase on an R.S.G. basis would be somewhat above k%*8.    We will not know the actual out-turn of local authority revenue expenditure in 1968-69 until later this year.    This may enable us toform a better idea of the extent to which out-turn in 1969-70 and1970-71 will correspond to the forecasts which are included in the survey and to which rate support grant for these two years is related,but it will be impossible to rule out an excess of out-turn over theseforecasts.    If such an excess occurred then expenditure could bekept within the total of  3,0h/7 million (see paragraph 5 above) in1971-72 only if local authorities could be persuaded to restrict thegrowth of their expenditure over 1970-71 to less than k%*9.    Generally the Departments concerned are agreed that, if theGovernment wish to influence local authorities to keep their revenue expenditure over the next few years within acceptable limits, it willbe important to give them guidance in this matter well in advance ofthe next rate support grant negotiations.   They recommend that thePublic Expenditure White Paper should include a statement on the rateof growth in this expenditure which will be regarded as consistent withthe Government1s strategy for public expenditure as a whole and that further work should proceed with this in view.AI-2
Ministry ofTransportMinistry ofTechnologyBoard of trade department ofEmployment andProductivitywhich work was originally planned to start in 1971-72 wouldbe deferred to later years.7.     While the Ministry agree that local authority current expenditure ought to be reduced, the reductions imposed onthe road element of this in 1969-70 and 1970-71 were very heavy, cutting this expenditure well below that for 1968-69,and justifying an apparently fast rate of growth in 1971-72,if proper standards of maintenance are to be preserved.Transport8.     A saving as listed in Table C would be acceptablewithout too serious consequences.    The larger cut in Table Bwould, however, mean a heavy cut back in InfrastructureExpenditure - expenditure on new public transport facilities,especially in the largest towns and cities.   It would mean that this programme of expenditure, for which -under theTransport Act 1968 grants become payable, would be broughtvirtually to a standstill in 1971-72, no new schemes beingstarted in that year, and thus would be bound to cast doubtson the Governments commitment to the policy.Technological Services9,     The reduction in expenditure on Technological services between 1969-70 and 1971-72 is already greater than in anyfunctional group except other military defence.   A further reduction of  4.8m. as illustrated in Table B would make thetotal reduction on the 1969 Survey figure for 1971-72 10.8m.   The figure would then be 11$ less than the 1969-70Estimate.   In the Ministry&apos;s view measures to improveproductivity and help the balance of payments would belimited and the probability of claims on the centralcontingency reserve for unprogrammable projects would beincreased.Other Assistance to Employment and Industry10.   If the savings required in 1971-72 were apportioned onthe same pattern as for 1970-71 the Board of Trade would berequired to find about  21.3m. from its share of the expendi-ture on &quot;Other Assistance to Employment and Industry&apos;.   A sav-ing of this size would have to be found mainly from expenditureon investment grants.    On the basis of a flat percentage cut the required saving would be reduced to  5.9m.;   and the samewould apply unless Ministers preferred to cut expenditure onthe promotion of local employment or on 1 other services&apos; by taking up some of the costed options mentioned in the Report.11.   The D.E.P. share of the expenditure on &quot;Other assistanceto Employment and Industry&apos; is about 25 per cent (includingR.E.P. and Redundancy Fund payments).   A change in either ofthese would require legislation and neither seems to be apractical proposition;   Redundancy Fund expenditure is alreadymore than covered by employers&apos; contributions.   With the discontinuance of S.E.P. additional payments, which providedAII-2
the bulk of the 1970-71 cuts under this heading, any furthersaving would have to fall entirely on the Employment Services,estimated to cost  74.3m,, in 1971-72.    The proportional shareof a reduction of  32.0m.  (Table B) or of  8.7m.  (Table C)could not be achieved without an extremely severe cut-back ofthe D.E.P. Services (including Industrial Training) whichhave already provided a saving of  1m. in 1970-71.Research Councils Etc.of        12.    The proposals amount to an allocation for 1971-72 ofand        either  103m. or  102.7m.   Even the higher of these is  6m.less than C.S.P. have recommended and  3.9m. less than theDepartments submission for P.E.S.C.   The Department is notin a position to say precisely what the effect would be on research Council programmes but our assessment is that evenif every new capital project listed for 1971-72 were omittedand there were no increase in research grant expenditureabove the level assumed for 1970-71, the Research Councilscould still not keep within even the higher figure of  103m.without a cutback on research grants to universities, or their own staff or on postgraduate awards.    Such a situation would he extremely serious.Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestryof 13.    As is apparent from the 1969 Public Expenditure Report,re, about three quarters of the expenditure shown in theand        Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry group is in respect of scottish agricultural support.    The figures for this are based on the1969-70 Estimates plus the full Exchequer cost of the 1969Review.    Because of changes in the level of supplies and inmarket prices it is not possible to project the level of support with any greater accuracy.    The policies and pricesrelating to most of this expenditure are reviewed annually by Ministers at the time of the Farm Price Reviews andjudgments are made according to prevailing circumstances.Two such Reviews, set in the context of the selective expansion Programme for Agriculture, must take place beforethe year 1971-72 is reached and it is invidious to try todetermine now what the circumstances prevailing at the timeof these Reviews might be and what actions Ministers might decide on to meet them.    The bulk of the remaining quarterof the expenditure in the group also consists of items whichare open-ended or fully committed.    For these reasons thereduction of  7.2m. lisced in Table C over all the programmes in this group is not attainable.Housing and Local Environmental Services14.    The scheme of reductions in Table B bears much more heavily on housing than on any other service.    In addition to continuing the ban on new investment by local authorities onsport and the arts and restrictions on other local environ-mental services, especially new towns, it would imply a cut of the order of 10,000 in England and 2,000 in Scotland inthe housing approvals in 1970.   The savings required byTable C on the other hand, while still involving the ban onspending on sport and the arts, can probably he made byofmdOfficeSE^SS?3
rephasing the housing programme without an actual cut in thenumber of approvals;    the Scottish approvals would have tobe cut by up to 1,000.Law and Order15.   Nearly all expenditure on law and order services is subject to factors outside the Government1s control anddepends upon the level of crime, the number of prisonerscommitted by the courts, the incidence of fires, and so on.The basic staff requirements for these services cannot bereduced and growth is inevitable to reflect increasingworkloads arising from these factors.16.    It would be impracticable to find additional savingsamounting to  9m. to  10m. on Home Office services withoutcontemplating decisions which seem politically unacceptable -for example, seeking to prevent virtually any growth in thepolice and fire services, making severe cuts in prisonbuilding at a time when the prison population is expected toincrease, reducing the scale of the criminal injuriescompensation scheme or of legal aid, or reversing ministerial decisions to spend more on child care.The Arts17.   Expenditure on the national museums and galleries providesonly for a modest growth in staff administrative costs;    and work on the National Theatre will start shortly.    It follows that, on the second assumption about the distribution of savings in 1971-72, a cut of  0.4m. in the arts block would fall wholly on grants to the Arts Council and the BritishPilm Institute, and would almost halve the annual rate of growth of 10 per cent approved by Ministers earlier in theyear.Education and Local Libraries18.   On the alternative assumptions about the distribution of savings in 1971-72 the sums required from the education block,in addition to the savings of  11.0m. resulting from decisions on 1970-71, are  4.0m. and  30.6m. respectively.   The first would mean, for example, a standstill in local authoritycurrent expenditure on the youth service and public librariesin England and Wales instead of an increase of 5 per cent( 3.8m.) and a reduction in the rate of growth in schoolscurrent expenditure in Scotland ( 0.7m.).   The second couldbe achieved by adding other items drawn from the originalcosted options - the introduction of charges for borrowing from public libraries ( 11m., G.B.);   a further increase to2/- from April 1971 in the charge for school meals( 9.5m., G.B.);    a reduction in the rate of increase incurrent expenditure per pupil and student in schools and colleges ( 5.3m.;   England and Wales);   and a reduction inthe growth of teaching costs in colleges of education( 0.2m., Scotland), as well as a further reduction in the rateof growth in schools current expenditure ( 0.1m.).AII-4
Health and Welfare19.    In the view of the Health Departments neither of thepossible alternative schemes of reduction adequatelyrecognises the special needs of the health and welfare services.    Savings of the order suggested could not beachieved without major, and unacceptable, cuts in the hospital building programme which would have to be publicly announced.20.    The Health Departments say that their proposal for anadditional  28.0 million in 1971-72 (paragraphs 18 and 19 ofSection 17 of the Appendix to the Main P.E.S.C. Report) was intended to help meet what they regard as inescapablecommitments.    In present circumstances they are prepared todo without this addition but that would mean they would haveto find compensating savings within the health and welfareblock.    They therefore believe that it would be unreasonable to expect them to make any additional contribution to 1971-72.savings, beyond the  10.5 million consequential on their1970-71 reductions and  3,6 million arising from the proposed reduction in local authority current expenditure.Social Security21.   To achieve a social security saving of  63 million in1971-72 (Table G) would mean postponing the October 1972uprating by about three months, until the middle of thewinter.    Pensioners then would have had to wait nearly two and a quarter years for any compensation for the movement inprices, and over 4 years for any real improvement in theirliving standards (the 1969 uprating will not give any suchimprovement).   All this would be contrasted with the new scheme legislation which would then have been enacted,providing for pension increases every other autumn.    The delay in the uprating would mean that it would have to be larger in cash terms, so that there would be an increase of expenditureamounting to  40 million in 1972-73 and  20 million in1973-74 (these figures would be larger if the uprating had tobe postponed by somewhat more than three months because of difficulties in mounting it over the Christmas period).Common Services22,   The savings listed amount to  2.3 million inTable B, and to  2.1 million in Table C,    In addition would be necessary to absorb  0.2 million extra expenditure resulting from the cuts made in 1970-71,a further increase of  0.3 million resulting from increased costs of schemes and slippage in the existingbuilding programme and a net shortfall of receipts of 0.1 million arising from a number of changes in these fore-casts.   These additions total  0.6 million, which may be offset by a saving of the same order as a consequence of a proposed cut in the 1970-71 and 1971-72 GTC programmes.    Adecision on this is awaited.23,   M.P.B.W. could offer a further saving of about 0,3 million but any further reductions on the scale indicated( 1.8 million to  2.0 million at least) would be impracticable.AII-5
There is no scope for cutting current expenditure - (as the1969 Survey Report stated, the M.P.T3.W. view is that thisprovision is already too low).    On capital expenditure,setting aside the office building programme, which, in thelight of the 4th Report of the Estimates Committee in 1967-68is under review by an inter-departmental committee chairedby the Treasury, the total expenditure on proposed new construction starts is not quite  1.6 million.    This sumcovers only projects of the highest priority to the clientdepartments concerned:    indeed nearly half is for theRoyal Mint and the residue of the GTC/lRU programme.AII-6
