I am circulating this paper accordingly.C. A.R. C0Board of Trade, S.W.1,3rd October, 1969
SUPPLY OP WASP HELICOPTERS TO SOUTH africa memorandum by the Chairman of the Official Committee on StrategicExportsBackgroundWasp helicopters have been supplied to South Africa as an integral part of the weapons system of the MATCH anti-submarinefrigates provided under the Simonstown Agreement.     An initial batchof six helicopters was delivered to South Africa in 196U, prior tothe adoption of the present policy in regard to the supply of defence equipment to South Africa.2.     In February 1965, Ministers agreed to the supply of additionalWasp helicopters to meet South African naval requirements (OPD(65)9th Meeting), and in November 1965 a contract was signed for thesupply of a further four Wasp helicopters.3.     Of the total of ten Wasp helicopters thus supplied to SouthAfrica, three have been Involved in accidents.     One was lost at sea,another was a complete write-off and the third is so badly damagedthat it is unlikely to fly again.      In May 1965, the South AfricanAmbassador was informed that HMG would be willing to consider the replacement of Wasp helicopters lost in accidents or throughmechanical defect,  in the light of the circumstances in each case.ko     The South Africans have requested the supply of additional Wasphelicopters which would either be to replace those lost in accidentsand/or to equip further British supplied frigates in an anti-submarinerole.     The order would be worth some  626,000 including spares.However, the Wasp helicopter was included in the &quot;shopping list&quot;produced by the South Africans in January 1967 and because of the ministerial decision to refuse supply of items on that list, officialsconsidered that approval to supply any Wasp helicopters could hot begiven without reference to Ministers.Argument5.     In view of the original agreement to supply Wasp helicopters for naval purposes and the decision in 1965 to approve the supply ofadditional Wasp helicopters to meet South African naval requirements and of replacements for aircraft lost by accidents, the supply ofthree helicopters and of any others to replace additional losses byaccident or for similar Naval purpose to those for which supply wasagreed in 1965 could be regarded as consonant with our existing policy.
2-6.     There is no reason to suppose that the South African Governmenthave any intention of using Wasp helicopters other than in the anti-submarine role. They have purchased a significant number of French helicopters-copters for land use.7,     Ministers will notice that the South Africans are asking for fourhelicopters whereas the number known to be lost is only three.      How-ever,  our Ambassador in Pretoria has reported that the South Africansare planning to convert further    British supplied frigates to usehelicopters in an anti-submarine role, i.e.  a purpose for which supply has been approved.Conclusion and recommendation.      Because of the political aspects of any supply of Defence equipment to South Africa, Ministers are asked to agree to the supply of Wasphelicopters as replacements for those already lost by accident,  and forany others   which may be lost by accident in future;    and also for thepurposes of re-equipping British supplied frigates for anti-submarinepurposes.(Signed) G.C.B.
