DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(69) HO28th July, 1969COPY NO.8CABINETEFFECTS OF INDUSTRIAL ACTION BY POST office engineering UNION &quot;Memorandum by the Postmaster general in considering the issues presented in C(69) 109 my colleagues will wish to be aware of the consequences of further industrial action by the Post Office Engineering Union (POEU).2.     The effects of the one-day national strike on 14th July werebrieflyInland telephone service.    About 25 per cent of trunk routeswere put out of servico and acute congestion and delaysresulted on many routes.    In local exchanges there were difficulties with power plant and in a few cases it wasnecessary to withdraw service from certain subscribersin order to safeguard essential services.International telephone service.    Radio routes to overseas countries were seriously impaired.    Out of 47 telephoneroutes, 42 were out of service and five had only restrictedservice.Telegraph services were similarly affected.Television.    There was no transmission from the Sca^^psaad^^Television Authority in London during the period of the strike.Mails.    There was some delay because of mechanical failurein mail handling plant and the non-operation of the LondonPost Office railway,Transport.     Some vehicles were stranded.Post Office Tower was closed to the public because of possiblelift failures.-1-
3.     As regards future Industrial action, the Union will probablyproceed by selective stoppages at key points for indefinite periods.Their power to maintain such action will be increased by the strikelevy which the Union have now introduced.    The effects of prolongedstoppages would include:Telephone trunk service would be reduced to chaos.in three to four days.Telephone local service would have to be withdrawn fromsubstantial numbers of customers in order to maintain essential services.    Many exchanges might have to be shutdown except for emergency and essential lines as PO.EUmembers curtail power supplies,Te?.egraph services would be similarly affected.International communications by radio would cease to operate.Mails and Transport would progressively deterioriate.Television would be subject to the same hazard as duringthe one-day strike but for lengthier periods and over widerareas.Post Off ice Tower would have to be closed to the public.Should selective stoppages be followed by work to rule or refusal of overtime it would be impossible to recover from the effects of theaction until some time after the return to normality.J.
