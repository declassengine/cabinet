DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY lS GOVERNMENT)C(69) 10528th July, 1969PASSENGER SERVICE CHARGES ATUNITEU KINGDOM AIRPORTSMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeThere has never been a tax as such on airport passengers in theUnited Kingdom.    The owners of airports can, however, mate such charges in aid of their own resources.    This was the case at Governmentowned airports (including those now vested in the British airports authority (BAA^before 1st November, 1964 and is still the case atsome municipal airports, e. g, Glasgow and Manchester.2.     I have assumed that there is no intention of introducing legislation to levy a tax, accruing direct to the Exchequer, on allpassengers leaving United Kingdom airports on international services.3.     The issue is, therefore, whether a means should be found ofincreasing the revenues of the BAA alone in order, for example, toreduce the amount of money borrowed in aid of their expansion programme,4.     The simplest and cheapest way would be to require BAA toincrease its landing charges for international services in order toproduce whatever additional sum is required, whether by way of a fiatpercentage increase or by way of an additional element of costrelating to the number of passengers carried.    Prirna facie the powersto do so appear to exist.    The airlines would thus pay the BAA direct.5.     The second method would be for the BAA to devise a method ofmaking a charge direct on passengers travelling on internationalservices (presumably outbound for ease of collection).    Our existing powers do not appear to enable us to insist that such a charge must bemade but it may be assumed that the Authority would voluntarily respond to a public request by the Government,6.     Assuming that an additional revenue of  5 million were to be aimed at, either method would lead to the real rate of return of BAAapproaching 20 per cent on net asset value.    Such a return wouldprobably be unique for any nationalised industry which has not had itsburden of interest reduced in one way or another, and would certainlyCOPY NO.      u u cabinet
be unique among international airports.    It would conflict with thefollowing International Civil Aviation Organisation recommendation,from which the United Kingdom has not dissented because of our desire to avoid our airlines having to pay excessive charges elsewhere&quot;(v)   that it should be recognised that, under favourable circumstances, airports may produce sufficientrevenues to exceed, by a reasonable margin, alldirect and indirect costs (including general administration, etc.) and so provide for retirement of debt and reserves for future capital improvements;&quot;The post-devaluation increase of charges at Heathrow was strongly criticised as infringing this recommendation and we came very close to a trial of strength in that at one time the airlines were publiclyrefusing to pay,7.     Moreover, the BAA though it is a rapidly expanding enterprisealready has a good record as regards its percentage of self-financing -and is the subject of continuing criticism by international airlines, whoargue, inter alia, that we encourage other States to make excessivecharges s-8.     A charge direct on passengers may be slightly less objectionableto airlines than extra revenue derived from landing charges.    But itwould pre-empt their own fare increases and their present and prospective fortunes are markedly inferior to those of the BAA.    Thecost per departing international passenger would have to be in excessof 15 s. to produce a revenue of  5 million and this is substantial inrelation to short and medium haul international fares which representthe bulk of the traffic.9.     The second method would also lead to serious administrative problems.    While it might, in theory, be possible to contemplate the selling of &quot;BAA tickets&quot; at the time when the airline ticket is sold, itis almost certain that airlines would refuse to co-operate.    This wouldbe especially true of foreign airlines and roughly half internationaltickets are sold overseas.    The British Overseas Aircraft corporation and British European Airways might grudgingly permit BAA Kiosks tobe set up at their Town Terminals, but more than one half the passengers report direct to Heathrow.1966-671967-681968-691969-701970-711971-72100%65%71%75% )70% )671% )EstimatedSECHET
10,    Ail checking must be done at the airport and this, together with more than half the selling being done there, would lead to earlierreporting times, add to congestion and passenger irritation and bring forward the date on which new terminal capacity would be needed.    It isthese latter considerations that have prompted many other internationalairports, e, g. German and Scandinavian, to follow the United Kingdomlead in 1964 in abolishing this charge at all the airports then under direct government ownership, and is especially relevant in the jumbo jet era.11.    I, therefore, conclude that it is not expedient, and probablyimpracticable, to attempt to exploit the monopoly situation at BAAairports, especially Heathrow, any further.C, A.P..C.Board of Trade, S.W. 1.28th July, 1969&quot;*3 **SECRET
