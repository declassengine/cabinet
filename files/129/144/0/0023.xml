C(69)12323rd September, 1969CABINETINDUSTRIAL policy memorandum by the First Secretary of State and secretary of State for Employment and ProductivityIh the next two months, we have to move forward into the nextphase of our developing prices and incomes policy with a new White paper setting fresh guide-lines for the relationship between pay, prices and profits.    This phase of the policy will have to be based - for we certainlycannot now draw back - on an Order in Council activating Part II of the1966 Prices and Incomes Act with Its provision for three months statutorystandstills on pay settlements and prices and legal penalties for those whobreak them.    Some of the large unions in the Trades Union Congress(TUC) together with a good many small ones have now carried throughCongress a demand for complete repeal of all Prices and Incomeslegislation.    We are therefore going to have serious trouble over theOrder (which will be opposed by the Opposition),2,      We must also consider the content of any Industrial Relations bill which we introduce next Session,    This is discussed In detail in Part IIbelow.   No balanced Bill is however likely to be wholly acceptable to the tuc.3.      We ought to consider our policies in these fields in the light of ageneral approach to industrial policy, both for the private and publicsectors,SECTION I.   INDUSTRIAL policy a,        Public Accountability4.      I feel strongly that we should at this time seek to relate the variousstrands of our industrial policy to a general objective: to bring a greaterdegree of public accountability into the private sector of industry, and to demonstrate that the same principles are applied in the public sector.   far more than the Conservatives, v/e have shown by our actions that we believethat Government has a duty to help private industry to increase its efficiency.-1-COPY NO.67IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)
This is a positive role reflected in the restructuring activities of theIndustrial Reorganisation Corporation and other Government agencies;the introduction of investment grants; the various schemes for advice and assistance to management.    But the Government also has the right toestablish a framework for the investigation of the actual behaviour of private industry.    We cannot in a modern industrial state rely wholly on theworking of competitive forces to ensure that industry is fully efficient or that market power (which is steadily increasing) is not abused.    We needmachinery which can study the relation between changes in incomes,prices and profits in individual firms and industries; and the relationship of these factors to the level of efficiency.    And in all this we need to adopta basically constructive approach rather than a limited range ofprohibitions,5.      Investigation is needed not only in areas at present covered by the restrictive Practices Act and the monopolies legislation,,    There areareas of the economy in which the sheer size of major industrial firms canresult in inefficient use of major blocks of national resources,,    There are many other cases where the existence of several firms apparentlycompeting vigorously does not in practice offer full safeguards forconsumers or ensure full efficiency.6.      The trade unions too must be brought to face up to their responsibilities in these matters.    At present individual unions can and doconnive at the abuse of market power by individual firms or industries where this brings sectional advantages to their members.    Equally theycan and do connive at inefficiency springing from wages systems no longerrelevant to present day conditions, from reluctance to link pay settlementsto changes in working methods, and from leap-frogging inflationary pay settlements oB*        The framework for investigation7.      Prime responsibility for keeping in touch with the behaviour ofprivate industry must rest, in my view, with the Government departments responsible (i, e. the Production Departments and the Department ofEmployment and Productivity) just as the prime responsibility for the nationalised sector lies with the responsible Departments.    I know that mycolleagues have been establishing far better contacts with the major industrial firms than we have had in the past; and this gives us the rightbasis for our policy.8.      The Monopolies Commission has been doing increasingly valuablework on mergers and in the examination of the behaviour of some of our major monopolies.    The President of the Board of Trade earlier this yearcalled attention however to some of the limitations of the work of theCommission.    And I think it would be generally agreed that there are many areas where market power is abused (often in effect by a combination of management and workers) but which cannot be effectivelyInvestigated under this legislation,-2-
9.      The National Board for Prices and Jaoemeu (NBF1) has in the pastfour-years moved from a narrow remit of considering the justification.for specific pay settlements and price increases towards wider examination ofthe relationships between pay structures, labour utilisation, pay levels,prices and profits in the firms and industries referred to it.    Its work toohowever has often been restricted by the nature of its remit.    It has alsobegun to develop techniques of efficiency audit for the nationalised industries which can both help the Boards concerned to focus attention onunderlying problems, assist Government Departments in handling theproblems, and at the same time show to the public that there is economicas well as financial accountability for the operation of these majorindustries.    It has also played a part in stimulating productivity bargainingand a better relationship between pay and performance from the pay of the boards themselves downwards.10.       I feel strongly that we should now move forward to the establishmentof a single statutory body which would be concerned with the whole range of problems involved in the public accountability for economic performance of private industry and the public sector.    The Report by the official working Party on Industrial Policy and the Monopolies Commission(C(69) 122) sets out the general scope of the work of such a Commissionand I believe v/e ought to go ahead immediately with establishing euch a body,11,       It will, of course, in no way replace the work of the GovernmentDepartments who deal with private industry and the public sector.    But we need in addition an independent institution reporting to the community as awhole on some of the issues which arise.    The new body v/ould effectivelytake over and in some ways expand the role of both the monopolies commission and the NBPI.    It would therefore avoid the growingdifficulties inherent in having two bodies each of which has a responsibilityfor examining the economic behaviour of private industry.    But theestablishment of a new Commission with broader terms of reference isnot desirable just to improve our institutional arrangements.    It would,I believe, be a focus for a clearer and fuller statement of our industrialobjectives and help us to create a new context for the development of ourprices and incomes philosophy,C*        Pay and labour problems12.      I am convinced that this new body must take over the responsibilities of the NBPI in relation to incomes, pay structures, and labour utilisationboth in the private and public sectors.    The main lesson of our experience with the prices and incomes policy is the need to consider pay structure and labour utilisation in relation to the operation of the enterprisesconcerned as a whole.-3-
13.      Moreover,&apos; the principles v/hich apply in private industry and in the nationalised sector must also be shown to be applied in the public services.The need to see that pay and performance are linked together is just ascritical in the public services as outside them, even though it is generallyreflected not in market prices but in holding down the cost to central andlocal Government of providing the services involved.14.      The Report by the Official Working Party on Industrial Policy andthe Monopolies Commission refers in paragraph 4(iii) to the methods of settling pay of doctors, higher civil servants, judges and other politicallysensitive groups.    These matters are under separate examination.    But inmy view the new Commission would be the best body to deal with thesematters - perhaps through a separate Panel headed by the Chairman of theCommission.    I think it would be a mistake to set up a completely separatebody for these purposes.15.      The range of responsibilities suggested for the new Commission iscertainly wide, but it is all linked to the central core of publicaccountability for the efficient use of resources.16.      It might be suggested that the Commission on Industrial Relations(CIR) ought also to be brought within the new framework.    However, at thisstage I am clear that this is not a practical proposition for various reasons,I believe that v/e can at this stage frame a programme of work on specificissues for the CIR which will not overlap with the functions of the new commission.D.        Prices and incomes policy17.      I believe that within the framework of public accountability which Ihave described above, it will be possible to build on the achievements of theprices and incomes policy while removing its present hated framework andovertones.    For the past three years we have, because of our economic difficulties, had to lay too much stress on simple restraint over pay settlements and price increases as a tool of short term economicmanagement.    It has become clear that v/e were placing more strain onthe prices and incomes policy than it would bear or than was publiclyacceptable.    It was for that reason that we announced earlier this year thatwe should not be maintaining the drastic powers contained in the 1968 Actafter, the end of the year.18.      We shall have therefore in any case in the next phase of the policy toplace less emphasis on arithmetical limitation on pay settlements and thewhole range of price increases (which we shall in any case be unable toenforce)? and more on stressing the relationship between pay settlementsand efficiency, and on limiting the abuse of market power by employersand unions for sectional purposes.    If v/e proceed to establish the new commission I think we should clearly state the new approach.-4-
19.      Basically the Commission would be asked to look at the costs(particularly labour costs-profits-efficiency of an undertaking).    in commercial undertakings prices would be an indicator of the situation -and in the last resort a power to control the price behaviour of firms wouldbe the natural final sanction (as it is under the monopolies legislation).20.      In logic, it might be argued that the Government should take powers in the next legislation to prevent the implementation of pay settlementswhich are flagrantly against the general public interest as revealed by aCommission Report.    I am quite clear, however, that this is something which would only be practicable if it were generally accepted as right and reasonable.    And at the moment it is not so accepted by the trade unionsor our own supporters.21.      The Report by the Official Working Party on Industrial Policy andthe Monopolies Commission points out that it has made no assumption one way or the other as to whether under the new set-up a power should beretained to delay the implementation of pay settlements while theCommission investigates them as under Part II of the 1966 Prices and incomes Act.    I have, somewhat reluctantly, come to the conclusion thatin the new context this would simply not be worthwhile.    In the first place,if we are going to have such powers at all, they will have to be more effective than the present ones.   Under the present legislation, once asettlement has been implemented, it cannot be frozen while the NBPIreports.    This is therefore a standing temptation to trade unions to insist on immediate implementation of a settlement before a reference can bemade.    In any case there is no bar to back-payment of the whole increase at the end of three months.    Moreover, the present powers can only beexercised for one year at a time.    We really cannot contemplate having arow every year over an Order continuing the powers.    If, therefore, weare to retain a three months standstill in the new legislation, it v/ill haveto go considerably beyond the present powers which are in themselvesinvolving us In a substantial clash with the TUC.22.      Three months standstill on price increases during Commissioninvestigation is on the whole really unnecessary.    Firms would be very reluctant to increase prices in such a period for fear of the Commission^Report.    And in any case three months is usually inadequate for a properexamination of a price increase in its full context.23.     I think, therefore, the conclusion must be that in the new legislation it is not worthwhile re-enacting the three months standstillpowers on either pay or price increases but to rely instead on referencesdesigned both positively to increase efficiency and, where necessary, to expose anti-consumer behaviour by all those involved In an industry.    Insuch a role the Commission should be backed, as the monopolies commission is, by powers over prices and these should be on the lines ofthe Report by the Official Working Party on Industrial Policy and the monopolies Commission.-5-
E. Conclusion24,     E my colleagues agree v/ith the general approach set out in this paper, then I consider that the arguments point strongly to immediate action on these lines.    In the first place, it is only within such a frameworkthat we can present a clear and effective industrial policy to the country.Secondly, if we announce our intentions of establishing the new Commissionbut without legislating next Session, we shall cause immense trouble amongstboth the members and staff of the Monopolies Commission and the NBPIand seriously cripple the effectiveness of both bodies (nor should we get an effective replacement for the Chairman of the PTB next spring).    Thirdly,we shall be able to deal with the introduction of the next phase of theprices and incomes policy more satisfactorily if it can be presented as abridging operation to the new and more constructive policy.    In particular,the argument about Part II powers could be largely by-passed.F, Recommendation25,     I v/ould therefore urge my colleagues to proceed in the following ways l-(i) We should introduce the Order activating Part II of the 1966 prices and Incomes Act and publish a new White Paper on Prices and incomes in mid-Novemberc(ii) We should announce in The Queen*s Speech our intention to establish a Public Accountability Commission on the lines of the Report bythe Official Working Party on Industrial Policy and the monopolies commission and publish a White Paper and introduce the necessary legislation in the New Year,
SECTION II     INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS BILL26.   When the Cabinet last considered the Governments legislative proposalsfor the reform of industrial relations, it endorsed (CC(69) 29th Conclusions,Minute l) the agreement which the Prime Minister and I had reached with the tuc   General Council concerning measures for limiting the number of seriousunconstitutional strikes and inter-union disputes.   As a result of that agreement, the Government dropped its proposals for imposing sanctions onstrikers or trade unions involved in such disputes.   The Prime Ministersubsequently told the House, in his statement on 19th June, that consultationsabout the legislation to be introduced in the next Session of Parliament would continue with the TUC and the Confederation of British Industry,   (for convenience, the Appendix of the White Paper &quot;In Place of Strife&quot; summarising the original legislative proposals is attached as an annex to this memorandum.The starred items are those which the Government has undertaken to drop,explicitly or implicitly, following the agreement with the TUC.)27*   During the course of informal consultations I have had with TUC leadersduring the past two months, they have made it clear to me that the general council regard the Government&apos;s mdertaking about &quot;penal clauses&quot; as excluding any legislative proposals which could result in the application of statutorysanctions against unions or strikers.   In particular, they maintain that theGovernment&apos;s undertaking applies not only in relation to unconstitutional and inter--union strikes but also to two important proposals which were not discussed at Downing Street.   These are the proposals, first, to require tradeunions and employers&apos; associations to register and to have rules on certainsubjects (e.g. admission, discipline, disputes between tho union and its members, elections, and the appointment and functions of shop stewards):   and secondly, to establish an independent body to hear complaints by individualsof unfair or arbitrary action by trade unions.   Whilst I cannot accept the tuc&apos;s interpretation of the 18th June undertaking by the Government, it isnonetheless clear that we can pursue these proposals only at the risk of a
further serious confrontation with the TUC.   In these circumstances, toy-colleagues will wish to consider what strategy      should adopt, and whatshape the promised industrial relations legislation should take.   this paper summarises the main alternatives which seem to me to he open to theGovernment.28.   The main choice would seem to lie between the following courses of action -(i)   to introduce a Bill giving effect broadly to all those proposals in the White Paper not clearly ruled out by the 18th Juneagreement with the TUC (including the proposal   for compulsoryregistration and an independent review body)j(ii)   to introduce a Bill which excluded these two proposals to which the tuc is known to be strongly opposed, hut which would cover allother items in the White Paper;(iii)   to introduce a more selective Bill which would be limited toextending the protection of the individual employee in hisrelationship with his employer and his trade union, but whichwould omit proposals designed to strengthen trade union rightsand bargaining powers (e.g, on trade union recognition and onthe disclosure of information to trade unions by management);(iv)   to have no Bill at all.29.   The main advantages of the first course is that it would be in line withour promises that the Government would introduce a major and comprehensivepiece of legislation dealing with all the problems identified by the DonovanCommission.   Anything less than this would be seen by the Press and public asa failure to face up to our responsibilities - or to the trade unions.   But inmy informal discussions with the TUC leaders their implacable and emotionalopposition to any financial sanction to secure compulsory registration and the revision of rules was quickly apparent.    .1 therefore asked them whether they thought the TUC could accept a provision which in effect would merely bring up-to-date the position under the 1871 Acts   registration would be - as now -on a voluntary basis hut would he limited to those unions which had an acceptable set of rules in line with the Donovan recommendations.   The major-8-
benefit of registration would continue to be tax exemption on income   appliedto provident benefits.   The response was hostile,   I was told the TUC wouldnot accept public control over rules even if this were limited to attachingmore stringent conditions to registration.   They would fiercely oppose any provision of this kind in an industrial relations bill.   They had begun toissue guidance to trade unions on the reform of their rule books and believe it was for the trade union movement to put its house in order without publicsupervision.   Thus if we include rules and registration in the bill this will lead us into another head-on clash with the TUC.   On balance, I think wecannot risk this and should therefore not seek to legislate on this subject.30.   If this conclusion is accepted, it will be all the more difficult to persuade the uncommitted public - let alone the employers - that the remainingproposals in the White Paper represent a reasonable balance between theinterests of employers and employees.   We should be open to the charge thatwe had failed to take any of the measures unpopular with the trade unionswhilst introducing all those which conferred advantages or privileges onunions or individual employees.   For that reason, I am inclined to think that course (ii) above could not be defended,31.   Should we then introduce a more restricted measure concerned with theprotection of the individual rather than the strengthening of the unions?The following items might be included -(i)   safeguards for employees against unfair dismissals;(ii)   the statutory right to belong to a trade union;(iii)   amendments to the Contracts of Employment Act;(iv)   extension of the jurisdiction of Industrial Tribunals todeal with disputes arising on individual contracts.32.   Even with a limited and selective measure of this kind, it will stillbe argued that excessive emphasis is placed on the employee1s contractualrelationship with his employer, and that in the present climate the employeeneeds equally to be safeguarded against the arbitrary or unfair actions ofhis trade union.   I think this would be a valid criticism, particularly if -as I expect - closed shop agreements of one kind or another become more-9-
numerous and, as a result, a manJs employment in a particular job frequentlydepends on his membership of a particular union.   Moreover, if we concede the tuc*s case on trade union rules and registration it xvill become all the moreimportant to ensure that the individual member has an effective right ofappeal if the rules are administered in a high-handed, unreasonable orarbitrary way, or if he is denied &quot;natural justice&quot;.   Unless, therefore, the tuc itself establishes a body of sufficient power which incorporates anindependent element to take the place of a Government-sponsored tribunal,which is unlikely, I believe a selective Bill should include a provision forthe establishment of an independent review body as the Donovan Commissionrecommended.   If we rule out provision for an independent revietv body, I think the best course would be to defer any legislation until the next Parliament -a course I would not otherwise favour or recommend, and which would almost certainly embarrass us greatly at election time.33*   As I pointed out in paragraph 27, the TUC will be hostile to this proposaltoo but they would be on weaker ground in resisting it than in opposing the supervision of mile books.   Union members already have a limited right ofappeal to the courts - for example, if a trade union official breakos the unionrules and thereby harms a member.   What the White Paper - and the DonovanCommission - propose is simply intended to make that right more extensive andits exercise less costly.34.   Politically, there are three main drawbacks in introducing a limited Billon these lines.   First, the Government has promised comprehensive legislation.Secondly, the TUC expects it.   Thirdly, a bill of limited scope may be open toamendments from both sides at Committee stage designed to extend its provisions to cover matters we hope to exclude,   I am taking advice on this point andshall report orally to my colleagues,35.   It is very difficult to assess the political disadvantages of a limitedBill,   As regards public opinion generally, I think we would find it moredifficult to defend a comprehensive bill which does not cover supervision of union rules and an independent review body than the introduction of a limited measure.   As for the TUC reaction, I believe they would express great indignation-10-
if we dropped comprehensive legislation.   For example, they attach considerable importance to legislation on trade union recognition which would entailunilateral arbitration in particular situations.   Nevertheless, it is myassessment that the degree of indignation would not be comparable to thefundamental opposition with which they would respond to any proposals to supervise union rules.   I also believe that they are particularly keen to havelegislation against unfair dismissal and this would help reconcile them to alimited Bill,e.c. OMENDATION36.   It is clear that there are serious drawbacks to each of the four courses of aotion set out in paragraph 28.   On balance, and subject to further advice on the parliamentary point in paragraph 34, I recommend the introduction oflegislation which would -(i)   safeguard employees against unfair dismissal;(ii)   establish the statutory right to belong to a trade union;(iii)   establish an independent tribunal to hear complaints by trade unionists against the actions of their trade unions;(iv)   make certain amendments to the Contracts of Employment Act;   and(v)   extend the jurisdiction of Industrial Tribunals to deal withdisputes arising on individual contracts.B.A.C.Department of Employment and Productivity, S.W.I.23rd September 1969.-11-
