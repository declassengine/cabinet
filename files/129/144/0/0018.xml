DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(69) 118 COPY NO.12th September, 1969CABINETPUB.LIC EXPENDITURE: 1971-72Memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerIf we v/ere to accept the public sector expenditure programmes for 1971-72 as they are set out in the 1969 Survey, the total ofexpenditure, including the capital investment of the nationalised industries, would be planned to rise, on a constant price basis,from the figure of  18,171 million which we agreed for 1970-71 to 19,111 million in 1971-72; that is, by  940 million, or 5,2 per cent.Bringing in the relative price effect (the &quot;Relative Price Effect&quot; isthe term used in the Green Paper &quot;Public Expenditure: A NewPresentation&quot; to refer to the allowance that needs to be made forthe fact that projections on a constant price basis will understatethe share of national resources which existing policies will pre-empt,since, on balance, prices rise faster in the public sector than in theprivate sector), the increase would be nearly 6 per cent, at constant prices.2,      I am sure that we cannot present this sort of increase.   Thereport on the medium-term outlook (SEP(69) 66) has estimated thatit would mean facing an imbalance in the economy in 1971-72 of somethingbetween  250 million and  450 million, assuming present rates of central Government taxation? and that report advised us to be guidedin our decisions on public expenditure by the higher end of this bracket,3.      More work has been done by officials on 1971-72, on the remitwhich we gave them before the Recess, and the results are in theirreport C(69) 117.    This works out the arithmetic of reducing thepublic sector programmes by enough to eliminate an imbalanceof  350 million.    My judgment is that at this stage we should bejustified,, by the progress that we can already show towards putting the economy right, in taking a slightly easier target for 1971-72 thanofficials have used.    I would trim the public sector programmes in1971-72 so as to reduce demand by  300 million.
4.       What this would mean in terms of reductions of expenditure would depend on the demand content of the particular reductions whichwe select.    If v/e could only find reductions with a relatively smalldemand content, v/e might need reductions in expenditure of well over 400 million.    But if we can repeat for 1971-72 the success we had in finding for 1970-71 reductions with a large demand content, we could probably achieve our objective with reductions of only  350 million.This is what I suggest we should seek to do.5.      In terms of targets for public expenditure in the form in v/hichwe have expressed them tip to now, this will leave us with as large anincrease as we can risk announcing.    The target for the current yearstands, as the Prime Minister originally announced it, at 1 per cent above last year&apos;s.    (This related to public expenditure, taking no account of the capital investment of the nationalised industries norof the relative price effect, which adds about ^ per cent to each year1^increase).    For 1970-71, as we have now decided the programmes, thecorresponding figure is Z\ per cent.    For 1971-72 what I am suggestingimplies an increase of 3-jr-3^ per cent.    This would give a reasonableprogression of annual increases in the three years,,    But it will not be easy for me to present it in relation to what v/e have already said inthe Green Paper &quot;The Task Ahead&quot; (Chapter 5, paragraph 7) that.. beyond 1970-71 ... the Governments planning assumption isthat the growth of public expenditure v/ould be broadly in line withthe growth of resources as a whole&quot;.6,       Turning to the question of finding the reductions, C(69) 117shows that in expenditure terms there are some  180 million of reductions in 1971-72 flowing from the decisions which we havealready taken on 1970-71.    The demand content of these reductionsis high - 80-85 per cent, or about  150 million.    So the problem is how to find reductions to produce the remaining  150 million in demand terms.7.       The broad approach which I favour for solving this problem is summarised in the following table.    Line A shov/s the objectives, in demand and expenditure terms, the latter depending on the demandcontent of the reductions v/hich we eventually select.    Line B shov/swhat we already have towards the objectives,    Li;;c C suggests a broadapportionment of the rest to be found.SECRe-T

I suggest, that we should instruct officials to work out specific proposals in accordance with this broad scheme, for our approval atan early Cabinet meeting next month.    In doing so, they should considerparticularly how much could be achieved by restraint of local governmentcurrent expenditure: for 1970-71 we were unable to touch this fieldbecause the Rate Support Grants for that year were covered in lastyear&apos;s biennial settlement, but the Annex to the officials report inC(69) 117 suggests that it might well be possible to find from this source a substantial part of the amount which under my scheme would remain to be sought from the civil programmes in 1971-72,9.      Summing up, my plan is -(a) To trim the rate of increase in public sector programmes in 1971-72 to reduce demand by  300 million.(b) To try to do this with reductions of about  350 million in expenditure terms.(c) To apportion the reductions broadly as shown in the table in paragraph 7.(d) To commission detailed proposals from officials on this basis, taking local government current expenditure into account.Iv..
