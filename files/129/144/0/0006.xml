his document IS THE PE.OPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)C(69) 106 COPY NO.28th July, 1969CABINETHOUSING PROSPECTSMemorandum by the Minister for Planning and Land,Ministry of Housing and Local GovernmentI am circulating this paper about housing prospects for considerationby the Cabinet in discharge of the remit given at the last meeting of theCabinet on Thursday, 24th July (CC(69) 37th Conclusions, Minute 2).2. The forecasts made last month by officials of the housing prospects for 1969 and 1970 in Great Britain, compared with the actual performancesin 1968, were;-Housing StartsGreat BritainPublic Private Total1968 (actual) 194,000 200,000 394,0001969 (forecast) 185,000 180,000 365,0001970 (forecast) * 210,000 195,000 405,000Housing Completions1968 (actual) 192,000 222,000 414,0001969 (forecast) 192,000 193,000 385,0001970 (forecast) 185,000 195,000 380,000* Information now becoming available about the take-up of approvalssuggests that this figure is too high; it may be under 200, 000.Public sector3.      The main feature of the public sector forecasts is the dip in startsforecast for 1969 with a recovery in 1970.    This accounts for the expecteddrop in completions in 1970 compared with 1969,    The forecast is based onresults in the first six months of 1969, when the level of starts and thetake-up of approvals of new schemes have been below the normal levels,and from a consideration of trends in local authority programmes.-1-
4,      Very bad weather in the early months have contributed to this yeartspoor performance.    But more significant factors have been the effects ofthe Ronan Point accident, and the reassessment of their programmes bysome major housebuilding authorities.5.      Ronan Point not only held up work in progress? it also led to the suspension of work on the design of a substantial number of large schemes to be built in precast panel construction while the necessary modifications of the systems were being devised and applied.    These schemes will nowbe moving forward again over the coming months.6.      While most of the major housebuilding authorities have been pressing on with realistic programmes, a comparatively small numberhave decided on large reductions for a variety of reasons.    Some claimto be deterred by the high cost of borrowing (the subsidy provides no help towards financing construction, as it is paid only on completed houses);or by the cumulative effect of a high building programme on the HousingRevenue Account, or on the contribution required from rates,    Some have reduced programmes following the rejection by the Minister of rent increase proposals.    Others say they have reassessed their needs and decided that a smaller programme would suffice.    Some ConservativeCouncils have, of course, used arguments of this kind to clothe political decisions.    Examples of Conservative and Labour Councils which have reduced their programmes are given in the Annex,7.      Over and above these particular cases of substantial changes oflocal policy there has recently been some shift in the general distributionof the housing programme.    The large programmes of new building whichwe nave stimulated in the priority areas, which have added very substantially to the available stock, is beginning in a growing number of areas to have a marked effect in relieving housing pressures and is leading to some moderation in the level of those programmes.    This has enabled us to allow some increased building by certain other authorities, whoseurgent needs, especially for slum clearance and for housing old people,have hitherto had to take second place to the priority areas.8.      The forecasts of performance in the public sector will accommodate the reductions in the public expenditare forecast for 1970-71 in Englandproposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    I would propose that theprogramme should be managed in such a way as to secure as nearly as maybe the forecast level of investment in the public sector in 1970-71 and1971-72,    We should however take all measures open to us to stimulate ahigh level of private housebuilding-.    The recent decision to increase localauthority mortgage lending in 1969-70 is a modest move in this direction.
Private sector9.      Performance is never easy to predict.    Demand in most areasremains high and the supply of mortgage finance is still the limiting factor.    While the supply of funds to building societies showed a marked increase following the raising of interest rates in April, current trends,on which the forecast is based, suggest that they will fall somewhat short of the level needed to maintain the housing market, and new privatehousebuilding, at a satisfactory level of activity.K.R.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S. W,l.28th July, 1969-3-
Examples of authorities which have reduced programmes following authorities are marshalled according to the broad reasons given &quot;by them for reducing their programmes.Gateshead and Maeclesfield have Labour Councils.
