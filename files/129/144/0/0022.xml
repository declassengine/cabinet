industrial.IA.Li commission report by, the Official Working Party on Industrial Policyand the Monopolies CommissionPART I - INTRODUCTIONFollowing discussion in the Ministerial Steering Committee onEconomic Policy on 31st July9 v/e were asked to define the scope,, nature and functions of aa industrial Commission if one were created - withoutprejudice to the question whether or not it should be createdo2,      The Commission would replace the Monopolies Commission and theNational Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) but it would not just be amatter of spatch&quot;cocking them together under a new name.    Policyrequirements in the partially overlapping area covered by the two existingbodies are not static and in considering the functions of a possible new commission we have looked at what seems likely to be needed in the nextfew years and not simply at the situation as it is today,3.      This has meant that we have had to make some working assumptions about the development of policy in areas where Ministers have not yet takendecisions - for examples prices and mcomess    These are not of courseintended to prejudge such decisions nor do they commit Departments in. anyway.    Their sole purpose is to enable us to put forward as a basis fordiscussion a reasonably firm picture of what the Commission might looklike, not blurred by too many qualifications 04,      On this basis we give in Part II of this note an outline of a possibleIndustrial Commxssion* and of its legislative framework,    V/e have made this as precise and detailed as we could but further consideration would obviously have to be given to many points if it were decided to go ahead,,Part II takes account of the need to make the Commission broadly acceptable to industry and incorporates the following assumptions o(i) In their different ways the Monopolies Commission and the NBPIeach provide a means through which external pressure  or greater efficiency may be exerted in the national interest on companies which for one reason or another are not subject to the pressuresof a fully competitive marketo    Part II assumes that sheer sizemay insulate a company from these pressures as effectively as adominant share of the market for a particular product (paragraph 5);*This title might need to be reconsidered in the light cf any decisions about its functions,,-1-
Part II assumes that the Governments power to refer incomesquestions to the Commission would extend to all forms ofemployments including, the nationalised Industries8 local authorities,the health service and the Civil Service,,    This is without prejudice to the question whether the powers would be used in any given case.(Paragraph ll)cPart II envisages that power would be taken to make standingreferences covering the pay of particular groups in the public sector.    This would enable the Commission to take over theNBPFs current references or. the pay of the forces and of university teachers,-,    In form the legislation would enablereferences to be made to the Commission covering the salaries of doctors, higher civil servants, judges and other politicallysensitive groups, though it is for consideration whether, in viewof the other functions proposed for it. the Commission would be an appropriate body for this purpose,,    (Paragraph 11)0Under existing legislation the Government have powers in certaincircumstances, to control the prices Sad goods which have beenthe subject of an enquiry by the Monopolies Commission,,    Part IIassumes that this power would be retained! its scope would bewidened to match the broader range of the Industrial Commission^enquiries but it might be desirable to provide that its application in any given case would be of limited - and not as now indefinite -duration,    (Paragraph 15 )0Part II assumes that the existing power to hold up mergers pendingenquiry and report by the Commission would be retained.    it makes no assumption about whether or not there would be analogousstandstill powers in relation to proposed Increases in wages orpriceSo    (Paragraphs 15 and 16),The setting up of an Industrial Commission would have an important bearing on the activities of the Industrial reorganisation corporation and the Commission for Industrial Relations.    ButPart H assumes that they are retained as separate institutions.There are several references In Part II to &quot;the Minister&quot;,,    It is assumed that a single Minister would be responsible for theCommission, though other Ministers directly concerned would be associated with individual references made to it0-2-
PART II - THE COMMISSIONFUNCTIONSIndividual companies5,      The Minister would be able to make references to the CommissionIn respect of Companies which either held a monopoly position as defined in the existing monopolies legislation (essentially those with a one-thirdshare of the market for a particular product) or exceeded a certain size(which might be defined in terms of capital employed, turnover or numberof employees, *.*)   This provision would cover associated and subsidiary companies effectively under the same control,6,      The Commission could be asked to report on the implications for thepublic interest of the company*s policies and operations as a whole or of specified aspects of them.    It would be made clear that the public interestcomprised such nationally Important edonomlc requirements as the need to contain costs (including wage coats) and to relate prices properly to thermto promote exports and compete effectively with imports and to sustain therate of investment and innovation necessary for this.    In order to reassureindustry it might be desirable for the tests by which the Commission shouldinterpret the public interest to be spelled out reasonably fully either in thestatute itself or in a document scheduled to it, rather as the White papers on prices and incomes are now.    While Individual references could bedrav/n widely enough to enable the Commission to examine a company!s totalefficiency * they would normally be asked to report on particular aspects ofits policy.   They might, for instance, be asked to report on the effect onproducti.vityf costs and prices of the level or structure of wages or of a specific wage settlements on a firm*s general pricing policy or a specificprice increase?  or on the use mades in relation to customers or suppliers,of market power In a particular product.    The Commission would be free to examine the company?s policies and operations as widely as they thought necessary to throw light on the immediate subject of enquiry,7,      The Minister could also ask the Commission to examine the resultsof past mergers which had at the time qualified for examination under theexisting merger provisions or those now proposed (see paragraph 9 below).**The number of industrial firms which would be brought within the commissions scope would vary, on a criterion of capital employed, asshown below.    In each case, a number of additional undertakings in the fields of finance, commerce and services would also be covered, 10 million 400 firms 15 million 300 firms 20 million 250 firms 50 million 100 firms 100 million 60 firms
&quot;Parallelism^8.      There would also, as at present, be provision  or enquiries into theactivities of a group of firms which conducted their affairs in such a way as to restrict competition (e0g0 by charging parallel prices where therewas no specific agreement such as would fall within the scope of the restrictive Practices Court),    While the more Important price leaderswould be covered by the size and market share criteria,, this power wouldbe relevant in circumstances such as those of the recent reference onelectric lampss where it is the parallel behaviour of a small, group of firms which is the real restriction on competition.Mergers9*      The Commission would take c, er the existing functions of the monopolies Commission in respect of mergers, including the special provisions for newspaper mergers.    It might be appropriate to increasethe lower limit for enquiry into British mergers from  5 million assetstaken overs perhaps with a reduced figure for enquiries into foreigntakeovers (see also paragraph 17 below).Nationalised industries10.      The legislation would provide for references on major price increases and associated examinations of costs.    There would also be provision for inviting the Commission to carry out efficiency audits of the nationalised industries on lines recently started by the NBPI (though it isnot envisaged that the Commission would be the only agency for such work).National wage agreements11c       The legislation would provide for the reference to the Commissionof nationally negotiated wage and salary proposalSj, settlements orstructures of significance to the economy.    While wage and salaryagreements and structures in large or monopolistic firms would bereferable under the general powers of enquiry described in paragraph above, it might be necessary to provide also for certain key settlements in smaller firms to be referred where they are likely to set the patternfor a number of settlements in ?ndividual firms together affecting asubstantial number of employees.    These provisions would extend to all forms of employment in both the public and private sectors0    There wouldalso be provision for making standing references of the pay of particular groups.Collective price agreements12. Where the Restrictive Practices Court has permitted the continuanceof a collective price^fixing agreement (e,g. cement), the level and structure of prices would be open to review by the Commission.o4-
General functions13.      It would also be open to the Minister to ask the Commission toreport on the implications for the public interest of specific policies and practices in a particular industry or sector.    Such enquiries might8 forexample, cover ground similar to that covered in the enquiries by the nbpi into selected distributive margins and by the Monopolies Commissioninto estate agents&apos; fees.14,      The Minister could also invite the Commission to report on general problems and practices such as those covered by the NBPI reports on job evaluation and productivity agreements or by the Monopolies Commissionreports on conglomerate mergers and recommended resale prices.    TheCommission would also have a duty ta keep under review developments inthe field o  incomes, cost and prices   and of industrial structure andcompetition (particularly the tendency towards concentration) and their implications for efficiency, reporting from time to time.    They would haveto submit an annual report (which would be published) on their activitiesas a whole.15.      While substantial reliance would be placed on the act of enquiryitself and the publicity attendant on any report to induce a company tomodify its policies, certain powers would be provided which might be usedboth directly and to encourage voluntary agreement.    The Minister wouldhave available broadly the present powers of the Board of Trade in respectof reports by the Monopolies Commission. *   The principal powers wouldbe -(a) power to control prices0    This is at present unlimited but it might now be appropriate to restrict its application to a period of twoyears following the Commissions report?(b) power to declare unlawful certain monopoly and discriminatorypractices (as at present), and to ban recommended resale priceson particular products where the Commission had found themcontrary to the public interest (a policy change for which this bill provides a suitable opportunity);(c) power to prohibit or restrict future acquisitions or require a company to divest itself of certain assets or subsidiaries?(d) power to hold up mergers pending enquiry (normally for not morethan six months).The NEDC also has certain functions in this field.* As set out in Section 3 of the Monopolies and Mergers Acts 1965.-5-
These powers (apart from the temporary standstill on mergers) would be exercisable by the Minister only where the Commission had found that the policies or operations of a particular company were in certain respectscontrary to the public interests and that use of a particular power wouldbe an appropriate remedy,16,      Except to the extent that the existence of price control powers mightinfluence the attitude of management in major wage negotiations8 these powers would not bite on wage settlements in Individual companies.    nor would they be relevant to nationally negotiated wage settlements or enableincreases in wages or prices to be delayed pending enquiry.    If ministers were to decide that such powers should be available, they would have to betaken specifically in the legislation,17.      The new legislation would provide a suitable opportunity to takespecific powers to stop foreign takeovers above a certain size (seeparagraph 9 above) whether or not they had been referred for enquiry,instead of relying largely on the exchange control powers,MACHINERYThe Commission18.      The Commission would be a statutory body consisting of a full-timeChairman, a nucleus of full-time members and up to 20 other members,all appointed by the Minister.Procedure., etc.19.      The machinery provisions would be substantially the same as thosein the existing prices and incomes legislation.    They would include thepower to compel the attendance of witnesses and production of evidence,20,      In appropriate cases the Commission would be required to reporton a particular reference within a specified time limit (normally between three and twelve months), but except in the case of merger references theappropriate limit would not be laid down in the legislation.    In conductingenquiries the Commission would be free to seek information in any way they considered appropriate, including the use of consultants., directdiscussions with those concerned, and formal written and oral evidence.21.      With the exception of the review function referred to inparagraph 14 above a the Commission would undertake enquiries only onreferences from the Minister,The NBPI is limited to between 9-15 members and currently has 150The Monopolies Commission is limited to 4-25s and has 18,    There Isconsiderable overlap in the type of appointee, though the balance ofcomposition is rather different,
Staff and cost22.      The Monopolies Commission has a total staff of 55 and running costs for 1968-69 are estimated at approximately  175, 000.    The NBPI has a staff of some 280 and total costs are estimated at some  ln25 million for1968-69 and  1. 4 million for 1969-70.    While it is not possible to makeany firm estimate of the staff and cost of the new Commission, someeconomy should be possible in comparison with the two existing bodies.LEGISLATION23.     There v/ould be a comprehensive Bill covering the setting up of theCommission^ its functions^ and the functions and powers of the Minister inthe field covered by the Commission    This would draw on and replace -The Monopolies and Restrictive Practices (Inquiry and Control)Act9 1948Part in of the Restrictive Trade Practices Actg 1956The Monopoli s and Mergers Act, 1965Prices and Incomes Acts, 1966, and 1967* and 1968eThese would be repealed in tote-7.
