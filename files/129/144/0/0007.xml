C(69)10728th July. 1969CABINETNORTHERN Ireland memorandum by the Minister of Defence for administration the memorandum by the Home Secretary (C(69) 108) refers to two matters, the possible use of helicopters by the Royal Ulster Constabulary(RUC) and the question whether or not the additional infantry battalion atpresent in Northern Ireland and due for relief in mid-August should bereplaced by another, on which I should like to seek the views of the Cabinet.Use of helicopters2,      Northern Ireland officials have raised informally with the HomeOffice the possibility of using the flight of RAF Wessex helicopters atpresent stationed in Northern Ireland for the emergency transport ofmembers of the RUC in conditions where the rapid movement of, say,30 men to a trouble spot is essential in the interests of keeping the peace.It has also been suggested that Army Sioux helicopters be used to observeand report to the police on crowd movement,3.      Taking surveillance first,, it can be argued that in certaincircumstances, the use of helicopters could make a significant contributionto the effectiveness of the RUC in controlling a crowd or a march, and thatit might indeed avert the need to call in troops explicitly for riot&apos; control.In the case of direct overhead surveillance of a crowd, however, theinvolvement of British military personnel would be so direct, and the riskof inflaming an already tense situation would be so great, that I consider this clearly unacceptable.    In the case of area surveillance designed to collect and transmit to the police warning information of movements orlikely clashes, the involvement would be less direct, but I neverthelessregard the risk of inflaming the situation as being great enough to rule out this course also,4,      The use of Wessex helicopters for emergency transport of RUC riotsquads would be less obviously provocative as they would not be flying overthe scene of actual or potential riot, and they could be restricted to takingoff and landing at military stations or other suitable places.    Their usecould provide an additional means of regulating the process of escalation,-1-COPY NO.     fi fiDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)
in the sense that if there were a risk of the police losing control of thesituation in one area, police reinforcements could be transported more quickly, and with less risk of obstruction than by road, and might thus beable to control the situation in circumstances where otherwise troops could need to be called in.    This relatively small and indirect employmentof British units in support of the RUG would be intended to reduce, and ifpossible eliminate, the likelihood of the direct involvement of troops,5.      These arguments have considerable weight, and I have consideredthem very carefully.,    I am sure, however, mat the political implications of even this relatively limited involvement of the military, in circumstances where the situation was still within the control of the police, are very different from those of committing the military to assist the civil power in circumstances so violent as clearly to have passed out of the control ofthe civil power.    On balance, therefore, I recommend that NorthernIreland officials should be told informally that a request for the use ofhelicopters in this way would not be granted.Replacement of the additional battalion6,      The 1st Battalion the Price of Walests Own Regiment of Yorkshire(1 PWO) was sent to Northern Ireland in April this year as an addition tothe normal garrison (two infantry battalions and an armoured car squadron)to assist in guarding vulnerable points against sabotage.    It is planned thatall vulnerable points should be handed back to the RUC by 2nd August, andthe battalion understands that they will return to Great Britain not later than 18th-22nd August, in accordance with the assurances given them thattheir posting to Northern Ireland would be for not more than four months.The military transport vessel which will move them (and which would beused for the transport of a replacement battalion) is due to sail from great Britain on 16th August.7.      It is not easy to judge now whether the battalion should be replaced by another.    If, as the Home Secretary suggests is quite possible, thereare serious disorders on 12th August, and it is clear on 13th or 14th Augustthat the situation has significantly worsened (and particularly if troops have been called in), Ministers would probably have little difficulty in deciding that a replacement battalion should be sent.    Of course it is unlikely that the situation will be as clear cut as this, and on past experience the immediate future following 12th August is likely to be atleast as obscure as it has appeared at almost any time over the last fewmonths.    Even if the immediate prospect appeared to justify withdrawal of1 PWO without relief, we should find ourselves in a very embarrassing position politically if as might well be the case we had reduced the garrisonto its normal level and within a matter of weeks found ourselves obliged tosend another reinforcement battalion.    My recommendation is, therefore,that we should decide now to relieve 1 PWO in mid-August, that the replacement battalion should be told now that it will be going to NorthernIreland for a period of not more than four months, and that during that- 2-
period we should consider carefully, in the light of the developing situation,whether two or three battalions would appear to be the appropriate level of infantry for the permanent Northern Ireland Garrison.    Among other things we may by that time have a clearer picture of the success of theNorthern Ireland Governments reform programme in calming the politicalsituation,8.      I therefore invite the Cabinet to agree?-(a) that British military helicopters should not be used either forsurveillance of crowd movement or for the transport ofmembers of the RUC;(b) that 1 -PWO should be relieved by another battalion in mid-August; that the relieving battalion should be told now that it is going to Northern Ireland for a period of not morethan about four months, and that further consideration shouldbe given to the level of the permanent garrison in NorthernIreland,R.H.Ministry of Defence, S. W. 1,28th July, 1969
