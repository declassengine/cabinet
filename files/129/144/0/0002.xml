THE TIMING AND METHOD OF RELEASE OF the records OF&quot;THE 1939-45 WARThe ProblemUnder the 30-year Rule established by the Public Records Act,1967, the first of the official records of the 1939-45 war will becomedue for release on 1st Januaryf 1970.    Thereafter, under the normaloperation of the Rule the remainder of the war records would for themost part be released in annual batches over a period of six years,ending on 1st January, 1976.    Some papers, however, would be caughtby the &quot;assembly rule&quot; of Section 10 (2) of the Public Records Act, 1958,which provides that, in relation to a file or other assembly of papers,the date for the release of papers is that of the last paper in the file orassembly.    An element of chance would thus govern the dates on which any particular papers might be released.    This, together with the necessityof having to wait for papers to emerge piecemeal over the six years from1970 to 1976, would be frustrating to historians wishing to study topicscovering the war as a whole.   Such historians will inevitably be moved to inquire between now and next January whether so straightforward, butfor them so unsatisfactory3 a method of operating the 30-year Rule is infact intended in respect of the wartime papers 5 and, if they are left in doubt about the Governments intentions, strong pressure for an alter-native arrangement seems bound to build up.2.     In the case of the 1914-18 war, where the records were due tounfold under the then 50-year Rule, we reached the conclusion that asystem of annual release would not be acceptable to public opinion.    Withthe concurrence of the Opposition Leaders the Prime Minister thereforeannounced in the House of Commons on 10th February, 1966, the decisionto open up in a single operation the records up to the end of 1922, the year in which the Coalition Government fells and an Instrument issued by theLord Chancellor tinder Section 5 (1) of the Public Records Act, 1958,brought this decision into immediate effect.    The public reaction showed that this was the right decision; and in the light of this and of the pressure which otherwise seems likely to build up it may be prudent toadopt a similar procedure in dealing with the 1939-45 papers.Proposed Solution3.     Recent interdepartmental discussion has shown that -(i)     It would be out of the question to release all the recordsin a single operation on 1st January, 1970.    The recordslikely to qualify for preservation are expected to occupysome 36, 000 feet (nearly seven miles) of shelving! theyare at many different stages of the procedure for theprocessing of public records5 and they will for the mostpart require to be carefully scrutinised before they arereleased.Mb 1 Ml
It would be equally impossible - without a disproportionateincrease in staff and in public expenditure - to releaseall the records at some arbitrary mid-point in the six-year period - e. g. 1st January, 1972 or 1973,It would, however, be possible to release at such a mid-way point the &quot;cream&quot; of the papers, i.e* those most likely to attract public interest and attention.    although this would involve certain staffing problems for theForeign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry ofDefence (see 8 below), all other Departments (includingthe Public Record Office) would expect to be able to plan for the opening of the &quot;cream&quot; of their wartimepapers early in 1972 without any increase in existing resources.    They are in fact now preparing to do so.All the papers for 1939 can be released on the one date -1st January, 1970j some of the &quot;cream&quot; papers for1940 can be released in January, 1971, without delaying the release of the rest, and some Departments whichhave little or no &quot;cream&quot; will be able to complete therelease of all their wartime records early in 1972,4.     Thus, we should be able to advance the release of those &quot;cream&quot;papers which in the normal application of the 30-year Rule would wait until 1973 or later at the cost of having to delay some, but by no meansall, of the less important papers which would otherwise be releasedduring the first half of the decade,5.     The Public Records Office, jud$fclg l^oxn the range ofinterest shown in the papers of the immediate pre-war period which arenow open to inspection under the 30wyear Rule, are of the opinion thatthe material which might be released as &quot;cream&quot; would meet the needsof about 90 per cent of the readers likely to be interested in the mainmilitary, political and administrative aspects of the 193 9-45 war.    Theyestimate that the &quot;cream.&quot; would cover about half of the wartime papersqualifying for permanent preservation - nearly 18, 000 feet in all,consisting of about 10,000 feet of the records of the Service Departments,nearly 3,000 feet for the Overseas Departments, about 1,000 feet for theCabinet Office and Treasury and 4, 000 feet for the other Departments,6.     Amongst a number of other classes, the &quot;cream&quot; would cover themain political files of the Foreign Office, some 130 classes of generalcorrespondence of the Colonial and Dominions Offices, up to 95 per cent of the wartime Army records, 70 per cent of the Air Force records,about 50 per cent of the Navy records, the bulk of the Chancellor of theExchequer files in the Treasury archives and the records of the Ministryof Home Security,    What would be left for separate release (as and whenthe &quot;creaming&quot; exercise permitted) would be the less important administra-tive material - e. g. the Mission archives and the papers of the functionaldepartments of the Foreign Office, the outs tat ion material of the domesticDepartments^, the records of emergency bodies such as the War*&quot;* 2 **(&quot;)(iii)
Agricultural Executive Committees; and the records of the Privy Council,Crown Agents, Forestry Commission and other bodies whose archivesmay be expected to lie outside the mainstream of historical research.7.      There would inevitably be some delay in the processing and transfer to the Public Record Office of non-selected classes of papers,including those of the early war years which, under the normal operationof the 30-year Rule, might have unfolded by 1972.    There might also bedelay in the processing of post-war papers, on which some departments have been planning to make a start before 1972.    The Master of the Rolls,as Chairman of the Advisory Council on Public Records, has beeninformed in confidence both of the proposal and of this possibility of delay, with a view to securing the CounciPs support if there is any criticism from the minority of historians who may have an interest inthe non-selected records.    He has in turn informed the Council in confidence j and the response has indicated that the proposal would havethe Councils support and also its understanding in the event of the releaseof the less important records being delayed.Manpower8,      The Public Record Office, having increased their establishment inApril, 1968, in order to meet the extra demands imposed upon them bythe 30-year Rule, would require no further manpower in order to carryout the present proposal.    Nor would they expect the proposal to imposeundue strain upon the facilities which they are now able to provide forthe public.9,      The only two Departments which quite clearly cannot have the&quot;cream&quot; of their 1939-45 records ready for release early in 1972 (or even at some corresponding point in 1973) without extra staff are the foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence,    For them theproblem is in part the sheer bulk of the records but also the fact thattheir files contain a large number of papers which are likely to affect thesecurity of the State or to cause embarrassment on political or personalgrounds.    The Ministry of Defence expect that most of the six extra staff required can be found within their present manpower ceiling.    TheForeign and Commonwealth Office also expect to require six extra, someof whom might be found within the present ceiling; and they would requireanother five for the India Office records.    But, whatever the temporaryneed for extra staff may be in these Departments, it may be assumed that the final cost will remain roughly the same, since the work of preparing the records for public release has to be undertaken whether therelease is on an annual basis or by the method now proposed.

Shared papers10.      As a substantial number of the 1939-45 records likely to qualify as&quot;cream&quot; will relate to wartime activities in which Commonwealth andforeign Governments were also involved, it is necessary to consider towhat extent it would be necessary, in any proposal to release such papers in 1972, to consult ot inform those Governments.    Many of the records ofthe wartime conferences are in the nature of &quot;shared&quot; records; and theForeign and Commonwealth Office s the Ministry of Defence and theUnited Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority also have amongst their 1939-45papers other documents which reflect the wartime collaboration and consultation between the Allies.    In respect of such papers the foreign and Commonwealth Office would propose to follow the procedure adoptedin 1966 of informing friendly&quot; foreign governments, which would inpractice be those with whom they normally clear documentary publications.In addition, they would need &quot;old&quot; Commonwealth (Australian, canadian and New Zealand) clearance in respect of the definitely &quot;shared&quot; records,such as those of the Commonwealth Prime ministers Conference ofMay, 1944, and, possibly, the Commonwealth TelecommunicationsConference of 1945011.      Such consultation with foreign and Commonwealth governments should not give rise to serious difficulty.    It was the Americans who took the initiative in proposing the release in 1970 of the wartime papers of the combined Chiefs of Staff? and to this we have agreed, with theconcurrence of foe Opposition, on the basis that the papers will first besubmitted to screening.
