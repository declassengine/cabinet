document IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNIviENT)67C(69) 116 COPY NO._9th September. 1969CABINETARRANGEMENTS FOR PARTIAL, CONTRACTING OUT OF THENEXT EARN?NGS-RELATEP PENSION scheme memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services the attached joint paper by officials of my Department and theTreasury gives the factual background to two very important issuesconcerning the arrangements for partial contracting out (&quot;abatement&quot;)to be made in thenew earnings-related scheme: the level of abatementof the employee^ State pension; and the terms of abatement - that is,the corresponding reduction in his and his employer&apos;s percentagecontributions.    To keep to our timetable for the Bill, on which dependsthe target date of April, 1972, for the start of the scheme, we need firm decisions on these two points by the end of September.    Between now andthen, I have promised a final series of meetings with the pensioninterests and other main organisations concerned.    In view of thistight timetable I have to ask the Cabinet now for authority to settle the main abatement figures to be included in the Bill.2.      In our White Paper (Cmnd. 3883) we promised &quot;partnership&quot;with occupational schemes.    The abatement arrangements are crucialhere.    Many employers with occupational schemes will have to choose between contracting out and seriously cutting back, or in some caseswinding up, their own scheme.    The abatement provisions must enable a sufficient proportion of them to contract out at a worth-while level,with a reasonable assurance that they will not lose thereby.    If this were not done, the insurance companies and others would be able tomount an effective attack by accusing us of deliberately wreckingoccupational schemes and damaging an important source of the nation&apos;ssavings; and both our own credit and the viability of the new scheme could be severely weakened.    The Opposition have indicated that theirattitude to the whole scheme will be determined primarily by the abatement provisions,3,      As the officials paper shows (paragraph 6), a pension abatementfor men of 1 per cent of earnings a year should satisfy most of the mainpension interests, though some would like more.    It is on the terms forthe corresponding contribution abatement that the main problem arises.Although the margins may appear small, a great deal is at stake.    In a
consultative document issued to the interests in June, we proposed terms which, when applied to 1 per cent pension abatement, would give a contribution abatement in the region of 1. 25 per cent a side.    these terms have met with violent and almost universal protest, not merelyfrom the life offices and the pensionf unds&apos; representatives but also from, among others, the Confederation of British Industry, the nationalised industries, the local authority associations, the NationalFederation of Professional Workers and the National Association of localGovernment Officersa    The abatement proposals were also strongly criticised by speakers at last week!s Trades Union Congress.4.      It would be inviting serious trouble to make no improvementwhatever on the figure of 1. 25 per cent a side contribution abatement.The life offices and others have asked for 1. 5 per cent a side for 1 percent pension abatement, but this is clearly too generous.    I believe the objectively right contribution abatement for this level of pensionabatement to be 1. 3 per cent a side.    This is slightly higher than thefigure of 1,25 per cent a side which the Government Actuary, from his knowledge of the life assurance market, has advised would be appropriatewil^/any &quot;inducement factor&quot; (paragraphs 13-15 of the officials&apos; paper);and v/e should be able to quote that fact in support of our claim to beimplementing the promise of partnership.    Further support comes from the Government Actuary&apos;s rough estimates, quoted under &quot;Case B&quot;in the table in paragraph 16 of the officials&apos; paper, which suggest thatwith 1. 3 per cent a side we can expect the number of employees contracted out to be somewhat higher than under the present scheme? whereas with10 25 per cent a side it would probably be lower.    I should make it clearthat neither I nor the Government Actuary regard as realistic the figures given under &quot;Case A&quot; in that table, since these are based on how theTreasury think the life assurance market ought to behave, rather thanon the Government Actuaryrs assessment of how it will actually beliave05.       I must however warn my colleagues that the discussions with therepresentatives of the occupational pension interests will be delicate and difficult, and it is impossible to be certain in advance that the idealsettlement v/ill be attainable.    The &quot;inducement factor&quot; needed tomake the terms acceptable to a sufficiently large proportion of theschemes clustered near the average (see paragraphs 13-15 of the officials&apos; paper) is obviously a matter on which the Life Offices5Association and the National Association of Pensions Funds v/illclaim to speak with expert knowledge and with authority.    It maybe that nothing below 1.4 per cent a side v/ill secure even the acquiescenceof the pension interests5 and although terms as generous as this could be attacked as likely to result in excessive profits to many of those concernedwith the more favourably placed occupational pension schemes, at theexpense of the contributors in general, this risk may have to be weighed against the strength of the attack to which an abatement of no more than, 3 per cent a side v/ill be subjected.
6.       There is an alternative approach which has attractions and which some at least of the pension interests might prefer.    Many of the complaints about the consultative document&apos;s proposals have beendirectedtothe smallness of the contribution abatement envisaged,on the ground that it would result in many employees either sufferingan excessive total (occupational plus State) deduction from their wagepacket or else having their occupational scheme seriously cut back.It would help to meet these complaints if we were to choose a levelof pension abatement which enabled us to concede the full 1. 5 percent contribution abatement asked for by the life offices and others.At this higher abatement level I should not propose to include any&quot;inducement factor&quot; in the terms, both because the resulting amountof contracting out could be expected to put the National SuperannuationFund in difficulties and because it would swell the already considerabletotal profit which occupational schemes, or employers, would stand tomake, at the expense of contributors generally,.    The terms would therefore be limited to those recommended by the government actuary, which at this higher level would produce 1.2 per centpension abatement for 1. 5 per cent a side contribution abatement.With these figures, the Government Actuary&apos;s Department have advised that, on the basis used for the &quot;Case B&quot; estimates in the table in paragraph 16 of the officials paper, the estimated numberof contracted out would be 5. 7 million and the period of growth ofthe Fund (that is, the period before it would run into deficit) 50 7 years.(Like the other figures in the final column of the table, this figure is subject to possible downward revision when revised costings of the new scheme are complete).    The latter is virtually the same as the period for 1 per cent pension abatement and 10 3 per cent a side contributionabatement.7.      I therefore seek the Cabinet&apos;s approval to discuss the abatementarrangements in confidence with the pension interests and other mainorganisations on the basis of a choice between:(a) 1 per cent pension abatement and 1. 3 per cent a side contributionabatement;or(b) 1. 2 per cent pension abatement and 1. 5 per cent a side contributionabatement.8.      I very much hope that if one of these two arrangements is putforward as the conclusion the Government has reached after consideringthe response to the consultative documents, and in the light of the adviseof the Government Actuary, the opposition will not be strong enough toprevent U3 going forward confidently with the Bill.    But, for the reason explained in paragraph 5, I cannot exclude the possibility that thediscussions will be even more difficult than I anticipate.    If this
is so I may have to give my colleagues a further assessment of theposition, particularly as to the arguments which will be used to demonstrate that the terms are too stringent, and the politicaldamage which may result bearing in mind the stress which the pension interests will put on the social and economic value of occupational schemes,Ro He Se CoDepartment of Health and Social Security, S.E.l08tb September, 1969
1ANNEXMemorandum by officials of Department  of health and Social Security and TreasuryArrangements for partial  contracting out  of   the newearnings-related schementroduc t i onChapter 5  of   the White Paper on the new earnings-re lated schemefund. 3883)  outlined  the proposed  system of partial  contracting out.paragraph 138  explained  it as  follows:&quot;The national  superannuation contribution paid by contracted-out employees,  and that part  of  the employer1s  contributionon earnings up  to the employees&apos;   &quot;ceiling&apos;   ....would be at a  lowerpercentage than would be payable  for  employees   in general.    Ascounterpart,   there would be a deduction from the personalretirement pension which  the contracted-out employee would receive under  the State scheme.    The occupational  scheme wouldbe required to guarantee him a pension of  at  least  the amountdeducted from his State pension.&quot;k White Paper also proposed that   there should be only one system of:ontracting out,   that contracting out  should be restricted to partit the employee&apos;s personal retirement pension  (paragraph 133)  and  thatraipational  schemes  should not be required to match the Stateicheme1 s weighted pension formula or twenty-year maturity  (paragraph 132)jletailed proposals  for a single system of contracting out on thisktsis were subsequently put  to interested organisations  in twowsultative documents;    most of  the pr incipal  interests have nowpven their reactions.    With the exception noted in the next^paragraph,  the main framework of  the proposed  system has not beenwipusly challenged.The White Paper  (paragraphs  140-141)   left  open  the questionAo should provide the dynamic element on that part  of  the StateVision for which  the occupational  scheme took over responsibility,kcause many occupational  schemes  could not undertake thefsn-ended commitment which index- 1 inking would involve,^consultative documents proposed that  the abatement  of state  .
pension and  the pension to be guaranteed by  the occupational   scheme should be fixed  in money  terms,   i.e.   should not  be  subject   torevaluation either before or after award.     The  improvementsresulting  from revaluation of  earnings before  award and any increases made after award would both be the responsibility of  theState scheme.    D.H.S.S.  are  in no doubt  that  a  single contracting out system on this basis  is  the only practicable one.    There waspressure  from  the Confederation of British  Industries   (C.B.I.)and the nationalised  industries  to allow  suitable occupational schemes   (i.e.   those with pensions  linked  to  final   salary)   to  carryat least   some of   the pre-award   improvements   themselves,   thusenabling  them  to   take over responsibility  for  a  larger part  ofState pension than would otherwise be possible;     but   after   thepractical  difficulties  of   such a  course had been explained,   theC.B.I.   indicated  that   they were prepared  to  continue discussions on the basis of  a  single undynamised  system.3,     The main outstanding  issues,  discussed below,  are  -(l)  The  1 eve 1  of  abatement   -  that   is,   the  amount  of  pension for which the occupational   scheme will   take over responsibility from  the  State  scheme;     and(2)   The  terms of  abatement  -  that  is,   the relation betweenthe pension abatement and  the  consequential   reductionin  the employer1s and employee1s  contributions.These two matters are of vital  importance.    Together,   they willdetermine not  only how deeply occupational   schemes are allowedto substitute for the  State  scheme but  also  the attractivenessor otherwise of  the abatement arrangements  to  individual employers - and hence  the number of  employees who are contracted out.4.     There are particular difficulties  in settling  the abatement  arrangements at   the present   time.    The  terms arevery sensitive to  the  rate of  interest   to be assumed.The present historically high level  of  interest2 .
rates results  from a movement which has now lasted for over 20 years,ancj it   is   impossible  to  forecast with any precision what will  happenbetween now and  1972   (the  target  date  for the  introduction of  the new scheme).    Partly  for  this  reason,   it   is  extremely difficult   to guesswhat the effect  of  any particular level  and  terms of abatement wouldbe, since  the number of   employees  contracted out  will   depend on theindividual  decisions of many thousands of  employers with occupational schemes and so will not  be known until  the new scheme begins.    Thehigher the  level  of  abatement allowed,   the  greater will be  theloss of  contribution  income to  the new scheme for a given numberof employees  contracted out;     and  the more generous  the terms,the higher the number  likely to be contracted out.    A combination of a high level  of  abatement  and generous  terms  could lead  to amuch larger number of  employees being  contracted out  than thepresent  b\ million under the existing graduated pension scheme(out of  a  total  of  over  12 million members of occupational   schemes) .If contracting out  of  the new scheme  took place on a very large scale the resulting loss of  contribution  income could even put  theNational  Superannuation Fund   into  deficit   from the outset  of   thenew scheme,  unless  the  contribution rates were increased beyond those proposed   in  the White Paper.5.    The figures for the pension and contribution abatements are needed for  inclusion  in the Bill,  which  is due to be  introduced at the beginning of  the coming Parliamentary  session.    On this  time-table they must   in fact  be settled by the  end of September,   so  thatthe Government Actuary  can  take  them  into account   (on whateverassumption  is  to be made about   the numbers who will  then becontracted out)   in preparing his financial memorandum on the Bill.The figures are also needed by employers with occupational   schemes,before they can begin  to make a proper assessment  of   the^plications of contracting out.    Many of  them, in both the private and public  sectors,  will  have an extremely difficult  task,   in.
the time remaining before  the new  scheme begins,   in working  out and implementing  their best way of  adjusting  to it.     If   they areto be ready by April   1972  they must very soon be given a firm basis on which  to plan.    For   this  reason alone,  any suggestion of  trying to make stringent  terms more acceptable by undertaking  to reviewthem before  the new scheme begins must be rejected.    The Departmentof Health and Social Security are clear  that   the promise  of   sucha review would carry no weight  with   the occupational schemerepresentatives,   whose need  is  rather  for  firmness  and  stability,which some  (though not  all)   of  them would  even rate as  moreimportant   than the precise  terms   themselves.The level  of  abatement6.     The consultative documents  suggested  that   the  level  of pensionabatement  for men  should not  be  set  at  more   than about   .8 percent of  earnings a year;     that  is,  an employee1 s personal Statepension (expressed as an annual  amount)  would be abated by at mostabout   .8 per  cent   of   his reckonable  earnings   in each  year  incontracted out  employment.    Although this  figure was  originallysupported by both  the Life Offices&apos;  Association (L.O.A.) representinginsured occupational  schemes,  and  the National Association ofPension Funds   (N.A.P.F.),  representing mainly self -admini steredschemes,   subsequently they,  and others  including the  institute of Ac tuar ies,   the C.B.I.   and  the main pension broker s 1   or gan i sat i on ,have criticised   it  as  too  low  to avoid  substantial   cut-back of occupational  schemes,  or  too low even  to make contracting outworth while at all  to many employers.    The L.O.A.,   the C.B.I.and the pension brokers have now all  asked  for  1 per cent p ensionabatement.    The N.A.P.F.  have asked for  &quot;the maximum practicablelevel&quot;,  with  a majority of   their members wanting something  higherthan .8 per cent.    The Association of Consulting Actuaries  (whose members advise s e 1 f-admin i s t ered schemes,  which includemany of  the larger  schemes)  have said  that  1 per cent wouldhe the minimum worth having,  and they would  like to  seesomething  like 1.5 per cent.4.
The nat ional i sed  industries have  suggested that  the  figure might beas high as  1.8  per   cent.     The T.U.C.   have not  yet   commented,  butunofficially  it   is understood  that   they would welcome  1   per  cent.]i    The arguments   supporting   .8 per  cent   as   the maximum were moretheoretical   than practical   (being  concerned with  the presentationalproblems of   the pension expectation  for younger  employees   in  certainhypothetical   circumstances).     A higher  figure would be of greaterhelp to many occupational   schemes   in adjusting  to  the new state scheme and  should help to gain acceptance  for  terms  of  abatementsomewhat more   stringent   than  the pension   interests would  like.Moreover,   on  the  sort  of  terms  envisaged   (see  paragraphs  8  to  19)a pension  abatement  of   .8 per  cent  would  lead   to  a  contributionreduction of   little,   if   any,  more  than 1   per  cent  a  side;     and  thesmallness of   this could not unreasonably be represented as a failure by the Government   to  carry out   its pledge  of partnership with occupational   schemes, through a worthwhile  system of  contracting out.   There  seems no  good  reason for  stopping   short  of  the L.O.A&apos;s.andC.B.I&apos;s.  desired 1  percent, with which the N.A.P.F.  are also likely to be broadly  satisfied.     The  remainder of   this memorandum  is accordingly written on the assumption that   the figure of pensionabatement  for contracted out men will be fixed at  1   per cent  ofreckonabl e earnings.     (The corresponding  figure for women will needseparate consideration.    Views  on  this  subject  differ among   thosewho have commented  on  the consultative documents.     An   important factor will  be  the likely position of  the National  SuperannuationFund in the  initial  years,   in  the Tight of whatever decisions are reached on the  abatement  provisions  for men.)The, terms of  abatementThe White Paper  said  (paragraph 139)   that   the  terms of abatement&quot;ould be fixed  so  that  &quot;the  total   amount  by which contributions wereeduced -  for  employer and  employee  together  -  represented,   on average,&apos;he commercial   cost  of providing the pension  for which the occupational scheme was taking over responsibility from the State&quot;.5.
9,      The problem  if   how to measure  &quot;average  commercial   cost&quot;.     Onthis,   the  second consultative document   said:&quot;It might  be  thought   that   the  average  commercial   costof  providing  a given  amount  of  pension could be  derived  simplyfrom the market   rates available  to  those  running pension schemes.    The difficulty here  is  that  the effective rates  forthe  commonly used with-profits   contracts  are of  their natureindeterminate.    Non-profit  deferred annuity  contracts are a closer  analogy  to what   is required,  but   they  are mainly used by  some  of   the   smaller   insured  schemes  and  so  represent  no more  than  a  small  part  of the  total   field.     (Self-administeredschemes work on  something  akin  to a  &quot;with-profits&quot;  basis.)It   follows   that,  while  some  regard  can  reasonably be paid  tothe market   rates  available,   they do not  provide  a  satisfactory basis   for  fixing   the  terms  of  abatement   for  contracting out  asa whole.    A special   cal cul at i on, taking   into  account   /^the accumulation of   interest  of  an   invested  fund,  mortality,   and ^the age di stribution and  earnings of  contracted-out   employee^/is therefore needed  to arrive at  a representative figure forthe  cost  of  providing an amount   of  pension equivalent   to a given  abatement  of   the  State pension.&quot;10.    The  second  consultative document   said that,   taking   into  account the  intention  that   the  terms of  abatement   should be  reviewed  everyfour years   (or,  where necessary,   at   the mid-point  of  any  four-yearcycle),   the Government  had  concluded  that, on a balance of   the factors  involved,   a  fair contribution abatement  at  the outset of  thenew scheme  for  a pension abatement  of   .8 per cent  of  earnings wouldbe likely to  lie   in  the  region of   1   per  cent   a  side.     The  corres-ponding  figure  for a pension abatement  of   1   per  cent  of  earnings(paragraph  7)  would be  a  contribution abatement   in  the  region of1.25 per  cent   a  side.     The Treasury would regard this  as  adequate.D.H.S.S.,   on  the other hand,   regard  1.3 per cent  a  side as   the lowest figure acceptable  to  them.    The figure asked for by the L.O.A. ,the C.B.I.  and the pension brokers   is  1.5 per  cent  a side,  which both the Treasury and D.H.S.S.  agree  is  too high.     The nationalised industries have however asked  for even more  favourable  terms,  which for 1  per cent  pension abatement would produce a  contribution abatementof nearly 1.7  per  cent  a  side.6.
11,    Although  the range may appear narrow,   a  great  deal   is at  stake.jn 1968 money  terms,   each  .1  per cent  a  side difference  in thefigure would mean about  15 million  loss  of   contribution  income  tothe State  scheme,   if  the number of  contracted out  employees remained at the present  b\ million  (though around. 3 million of   these  arein public   sector  schemes,   which would  therefore  share  in any financial   advantage).     But   the  actual  difference might  be  still greater,   since  the more  generous  the  terms  the  larger the numbersof employees  likely to be contracted out.12,    There   can be no  single right  answer  from the point   of  viewof occupational  schemes   themselves,  because of  the wide  variation in their   size of membership,   age distribution and profitability.About 50,000 of  the total of 65 , 000 or  so occupational scheme shave less  than 50 members,   the   great  majority   of   these being   insuredschemes.    Such schemes are  likely to be more  influenced by  the precise terms,   and their  expected profitability or unpr of i t abi 1 i t y ,than are most   of   the larger   se 1 f-admini s t er ed  schemes.    terms which were  tolerable for  the  large s el f -admini s t ered  schemes  couldbe unduly stringent   for most  of   the  smaller  schemes,   taking  intoaccount  their higher proportionate overheads  and  the need  for  someprofit margin for   the Life Offices  which  insure  them.    On  theother hand,   terms which made it worthwhile for most  of   thesmaller insured schemes   to contract  out would  inevitably be quiteprofitable  for  the large  s e 1 f-admini s t er ed  schemes.     wherever the terms are  set,   there will  be some point  along the  spectrumbeyond which a fair number of  employers with schemes  judge  it  better not to contract  out,   either because the particular age distributionof their  employees would make it  unprofitable  (the  older  the employee,   the more costly his  occupational pension)   or becausethey prefer  not  to incur   the  administrative  complications.(Unf avourable age di s tr ibut i ons wi 11 be particularly prevalentamong smaller employers,  because  the age distribution of a  small number of  employees  is more likely  to depart markedly from theaverage than is  that  of  a  large number of   employees.)7.
[3t\    Two   factors need  to be distinguished  -(1)  Terms  suitable  for &quot;average&quot;  schemes,   i.e.   terms  such that   schemes with an average age distribution would belikely  to find them   just   sufficiently attractive  iflooked  at   from a  strictly  commercial  viewpoint.(2) What may be called an &quot;inducement  factor&quot;.    The purposeof  this,  bearing   in mind  the promise of  partnership withoccupational   schemes,   would be  to weight   the  terms  so  asto make  them  sufficiently attractive  for a proportion ofschemes with a higher  than  average ratio  of  older members,and  so  as   to offset   the  discouragement   to contracting outcaused   to  some  employers by  the  administrativecomplications  and expense.14,     On paragraph 1 3 ( 1 ) ,   the   crucial   factor  is   the  rate ofinterest   to be assumed on  the   investment  of   income from occupational scheme contributions.    Not   surprisingly,   therefore,   the occupational pension  interests originally argued   in  favour of  a very-conservative  assumption about   the  level   of  long-term  interest  rates.D.H.S.S.,   the Government  Actuary and  the Treasury are all   agreedthat  the Life Office proposals were unrealistic,   especially  in viewof the proposed  frequent  reviews  of   the  terms  in  the  light  of changes   in  interest   rates  and other  factors   (paragraph 10) .     Thequestion  is what  would represent  a  realistic  rate.     The  current   rate on long-term Government   stock   is now over  9 per cent,   and   in   theTreasury&apos;s view the best  assumption that  can be made about  the nearfuture  is   that   rates will   continue at  about   this  level   (thoughit would be not   too  easy   to  say  this   in public).     In  the  longer term,  given  continuing  expectation of   inflation and  the  likelihood that investors will   continue  to  look  for a  real   rate of  at   least^per cent,  an   interest  rate of 6 per cent  looks  to  theTreasury about   the minimum.    Making  some allowance  therefore  forthe possibility of  a drop  in  rates  over  the next   few years,   a8.
caSe can be argued  for  basing  the  terms  on 8 per  cent   in  the shortterm and 6  per  cent   in the  long  term  (case A).     On the basis  ofthese assumptions   the Government Actuary has  calculated  that  a contribution abatement  of   1.15 per cent  a  side would be fairfor the &quot;average&quot;  scheme.    Alternatively,  assuming  that  the occupational pension  interests  might   take a more cautious  viewof future  interest  rates,   the  terms might  be based on a  short-termrate of   l\ per  cent  and  a  long-term rate of 5^ per  cent,   (case B).On this basis  the Government Actuary has calculated  that  a contribution abatement  of   1.25 per  cent  a  side would be fair  for   the&quot;average&quot;  scheme.    As between these two possibilities  the Treasuryconsider  that Case A  is   the more  realistic  assessment  of  probablefuture rates,  while the Government Actuary considers  that Case Bis more likely to reflect  the actual behaviour of   the  life assurancemarket.    The Treasury and  the Government Actuary agree  that  nolower assessment  of  future  interest  rates would be realistic.15.    The figures of   1.15  or  1.25 per cent  a side are both beforethe addition of  any  inducement  factor under paragraph  13(ii).The Government Actuary has advised  that,  because  of  the  intensiveclustering of  occupational   schemes within a small  area on either side of  the &quot;average&quot; scheme,  a comparatively small   inducement  factormay have a substantial  effect  on the numbers contracted out   (seethe table   in  the next  paragraph);     and   in his  view an  inducementfactor of   .05 per  cent   should  be  sufficient   to bring  in marginalschemes  containing  substantial  numbers of   employees.     Adding.05 to the abatement derived from Case A would produce a contributionabatement  of  1.2 per  cent  a side;     in case B the abatement would amount  to  1.3 per  cent  a  side.    The Treasury regard  the formerfigure as  adequate.    D.H.S.S.  however,  regard  the.latter  figureas the minimum.    The Government Actuary would regard  1.25 per cent a side as  fair  terms  for  the&quot;average&quot; scheme without making any allowance for an  inducement factor;     and the Treasury would beprepared to agree  to this  figure as a compromise.9.
jD(    The Government  Actuary has  attempted rough estimates of  thetotal number of   employees who would be  contracted out   and  theeffect of   the  resulting  loss of   income on  the National   SuperannuationFund&apos; s period of  growth,   i.e.   the  period before  the  initial  national superannuation  contribution rates   (4-f per  cent  by  employee;4j per  cent, without  an  earnings  ceiling,   by  the empl oyer) *  will  need to be raised.     These  are   shown  in  the  table below  (which assumes that the  contribution abatement  will  be  the  same for women  as  formen).    The   figures   for the numbers   contracted out  are  subject   to  aconsiderable margin of  error,   and   those  for  the period of  growth of the Fund,  based on the  costings   in Cmnd.   3883,   are  subject   to possible downward revision when revised costing  are  complete1^.With these qualifications,   the   table gives a broad  idea of  theestimated  comparative  effect  of  different   contribution abatements,on alternative  assumptions  as   to  how the occupational  pensionworld will   assess   the effect  of   the  abatement   terms:     either thatit will   take a  similar view to  that  of   the Treasury as  to  futureinterest  rates   (case A  in paragraph  14) ;     or  that   the assumptionsit makes on  this  subject  will   be as  expected by the government actuary  (case B  in paragraph  14) .     For comparison,   the numbercontracted  out   of   the existing graduated pension scheme   is  currentlyabout  b\ million,   and  can be  expected to   increase  to  perhaps6 mil 1 ion by 1972 .*Something  between a  further  2  per  cent  and 2^ per  cent  will  be needed for social   insurance benefits and national health service contribution  - with an additional    per cent,  by the  employer only,for the redundancy payments   scheme.^The extent of any such revision cannot be forecast at present, butthe net effect of changes already known would probably be to reducethe period of  growth of  the Fund by  rather more  than a year.10.

In support of their view that the contribution abatementshould be not less than 1.3 per cent a side, D.H.S.S. maintain that -(l) Employers who  contract out will be  taking on a definite and  inescapable  commitment  to provide occupational pensions  on  certain terms,  and they cannot be expectedto do this unless  there  is a  sufficient margin toencourage  them to  take  the  risk of  loss.    Once  thedecision  to  contract out  has been  taken an employerwill  not  want  the upheaval  of unscrambling  it becauselater events have made  the terms less  favourable than he expected.    Provision  for reviews of   the terms can be no more than a partial  answer  to  this.11 .
The terms proposed  in the  second consultative document  have met with violent  opposition  from the pension  interests andother  organisations,   including  the C.B.I.,   the nationalised industries,   the   local   government  associations,   the NationalFederation of Professional  Workers  and  the national association of Local Government Officers  (N.A.L.G.0.).Due allowance must;  of  course be made  for   their  desire  toget   the most   favourable  terms possible,   by  exerting whateverpressure  they can;    and this pressure must be expected tocontinue after   the Government1s decision has been announced.But  to make no  concession whatever  on the  terms,   as would  bethe case with a contribution abatement of  1.25 per cent a sidefor 1  per cent pension abatement  (the  same ratio as  the consultative document&apos;s  figures  of  1  per  cent  and   .8 per cent respectively),  would be likely  to cause not  onlydisappointment  but  genuine hostility.It would hardly be possible,   even  if   it were desirable,   toavoid making public   the Government Actuary&apos;s  advice  that1.25 per  cent  a side would represent   fair   terms   for   the&quot;average&quot;  scheme  from an actuarial  point of view,  wi thoutany  inducement   factor.     An  improvement  on that   figure would therefore enable  the Government   to  claim some credit   for implementing   the promise of  partnership with occupational schemes.    But with no   improvement  on  it   the Governmentwould  either have  to admit  that no  inducement  factor whateverwas being added,  which would expose  it  to a charge of breach of   faith about partnership;     or  else   it would have   to  say   thatthe  terms were based on assumptions which differed  from theGovernment Actuary&apos;s advice on how  the life assurance marketcould be expected  to  behave.    That market customarily basesits calculations on a prudent view of  long-term interest rates,   a fact which cannot be disregarded in settling  terms which  the Government  have undertaken will  be &quot;commercial&quot;.Whether  rightly or wrongly,12.
the market may have different   expectations  from  those of   theTreasury,   and  cannot  be  expected   to alter   those  expectations   -which determine   the premium rates   for  the whole of   their business,   and not merely for  the  slice required  for contracting out   -  in order   to make  the abatement   terms   lookattractive  to employers.     Further,   as paragraph  14 makesclear,   it  could well  be  embarrassing  if,   in order   to defendstringent   terms,   the Government were  forced   to give publiclythe Treasury&apos;s  expectations  on  future  interest  rates.(4)    On  the basis  of   the   figures under  Case B  in  the   table   inparagraph  16,   1.25 per cent  a  side would   lead  to  feweremployees  being  contracted  out   than under   the present  scheme.If   these  figures were   to become public   they would,   again,either  expose   the Government   to a charge  of  breach  of  faithor  else have   to be  rejected by   them.18.   The Treasury,   on   the  other hand,  maintain  that   -(1)    Given   the proposed  frequent  reviews   of   terms,   the market  neednot   take an over-cautious view of   long-term interest  rates.On  this basis a contribution abatement  of   1.25 per  cent  aside would contain a  sufficient   inducement  factor   to  enablemarginal   schemes   to  contract  out,   and should  be quiteadequate   to  ensure   that  contracting  out   remained  on about   thesame  scale as  at  present.(2)    Anything more   than   1.25 per  cent a  side would be  over-generousto   the occupational   scheme  interests,   or  employers,   at   theexpense of   the  generality  of  contributors who were  notcontracted  out.     These would be mostly  lower paid workers,and  the  terms would  thus be open to  attack as  amounting  toredistribution  in favour of   the better off.(3)    The Government  would not  obtain any  credit  from concedingterms more  favourable   than  those  recommended by  the government actuary.     This   could  only prompt  questions  about   the  reasonsfor  such a concession,   and  about who would benefit   from   itat   the   expense  of  contributors   (or   taxpayers)   generally.13.
(4)     In the event,   the pension world will,   in its  own interests,  wish  to make the best  of  the  terms offered,even though less generous  than they may have hoped:so  long as   the   terms offer  any margin of  profit   tooccupational   schemes,   or  employers,   they will  be encouraged  to  contract  out.19,   In settling  the abatement   terms, Ministers will  need  todecide how far  they accept  the views  of D.H.S.S.,   or alternativelythose of   the Treasury.Points for  decision,   Ministerial decisions  are needed on  the  following  points  -(1)    Whether   the  level   of  pension abatement  for men  shouldbe 1 per cent  of reckonable earnings a year.     (Paragraph  7)(2)    What  should be  the corresponding  level  of  contributionabatement.     (Paragraphs  8  to  19).14.
