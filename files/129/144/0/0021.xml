(this   DOCUMENT  IS   THE PROPERTY OF HER  BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;5   GOVERNMENTlimited.The circulation of this paper has been sfficiTyJIt is issued for the personal use of..............TOP SECRET g gCopy No. cC(69)12123rd September, 1969CABINETPARLIAMENT (No. 7) BILL,Memorandum by the Lord chancellor at their meeting on 10th July the Cabinet invited me to arrange forthe Ministerial Committee on the House of Lords to consider thedesirability of introducing a Bill to limit the House of lords  powers andto report to the Cabinet in September (CC(69) 32nd Conclusions. Minute 1).Subsequently I v/as invited by the group of Ministers considering the Houseof Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Bill to arrange for the preparationof a Bill to curtail the powers of the House of Lords 111 cclsg the cabinet should decide to introduce such a Bill.    I attach a copy of the draft bill which has been prepared by Parliamentary Counsel for this purpose andwhich was considered by the Ministerial Committee on the House of lords on the 30th July,.2.       The substantive provisions of the Bill are virtually identical withclauses 8-15 of the Parliament (No, 2) Bill except that three calendarmonths has been substituted for six calendar months as the period of delay in clause 2(2) of the draft Bill.    The only other changes between the draftBill and the earlier clauses are that the opportunity has been taken toleave out subsection (2) of clause II (which would have enabled either house during the period of delay to propose to the other House amendmentswith which they would agree to a Bill) and that clause 6 of the draft bill now includes a reference to Special Procedure Orders which ought to havebeen included in clause 14 of the earlier Bill,    Clause 11(2) of that bill was included in pursuance of the understanding reached in the talks which preceded the introdtxetion of the Bill, but I think a provision of this kind isquite likely to lead to trouble in the future and it seems better to leave it out.3.      It seems desirable that the draft Bill should follow as closely aspossible the provisions relating to powers which were contained in theearlier Bill, becatise those provisions were very carefully considered atthe time and no defects were disclosed by the amendments tabled during-1-
the proceedings on the Bill in the House of Commons. Moreover, fromthe point of view of tactics, I think there is a good deal to be said for thenew Billts being in a form which is recognisably the same on powers, sofar as possible, as the earlier Bill.4.      A decision at this juncture to introduce legislation to curtail thepowers of the House of Lords v/ould not, of course, affect the date onwhich the House of Commons (P.edistribution of Seats) Bill could become law under the existing Parliament Acts,    The procedure under those Actsrequires that the Bill shall have been passed by the House of Commons intwo successive Sessions, v/ith a minimum interval of one year betweenSecond Reading in the first Session and the date of its passing in thesecond Session; and to have been sent up to the House of Lords ^^t least one month before the end of each Session.     The earliest date on whichthe House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Bill could become law onthis basis would be 2nd August, 1970.5.      Assuming a new Parliament Bill to be introduced as soon as parliament reassembles,, the earliest date on which it could receive aSecond Reading v/ould be 15th October so that it could not become law before 15th November, 1970 at the earliest.    Moreover even with atimetable motion for all stages the Bill could hardly be sent to the Lordsbefore 20th October, v/hich would mean that the 1968-69 Session v/would have to be extended at least until 21st November,    The consequences forthe 1969-70 Session would also be serious.    On the most favourableassumptions the Session would have to continue until 16th November;  andif the Lords, instead of rejecting the Bill outright, chose to send it backwith unacceptable amendments, it might be necessary to prorogue thenand start a new Session in order to meet the requirements of the parliament Acts,    The Annex to this memorandum deals in more detail with the difficulties inherent in relying on the Parliament Act procedure in present circumstances,6.      We have also to consider the legislative consequences of introducing a Parliament Bill in the autumn.    The spirit of co-operation in the House of Lords on which a Labour Government is bound to rely toget its business through will disappear completely and v/e shall be facedwith prolonged and determined obstruction.    There will be nothing toprevent the Conservatives from seeking to amend the Parliament Billby including all the clauses about composition which v/ere in the earlierBill and this will lead to time-consuming debates v/hich will sex-iouslyinterfere v/ith the progress of other and urgently needed Bills,    There is little doubt that the remainder of our business would be seriously interferewith both this Session and next and, given the stage in the life of this parliament which will have been reached before the Parliament Bill canbecome law, it is very doubtful whether we should stand to gain anycompensating benefits.-2-
7,      &quot;We did not think that the Lords would at first reject the No0 7 Bill,but that they would amend it by introdvicing the previous clauses on the composition of the Lords so that, while the Commons would send up the parliament (no. 8 7) Bill, what they would get back would be the parliament (Noc 2) Bill,    And what would the Government do then?8.      The whole question was carefully considered by the ministerial committee on the 30th July and we were unanimously of the opinion that no reference to such a Bill should be included in The Queen*s Speech and thatno such Bill should be introduced either this Session or nextoHouse of Lords, SUW,L19th Septembero 1969
&quot; ANNEXDifficulties of the Parliament act the legal effect of the provisions of the Parliament Act, 1911 is by nomeans free from difficulty*    Section 2(1) of that Act9 as amended in 1949,requires a Public Bill (other than a Money Bill or a Bill extending themaximum duration of Parliament) to have been passed by the House ofCommons in two successive Sessions and, having been sent up to the Houseof Lords at least one month before the end of the Session, to have been rejected by that House In each of those Sessions,,    Then the Bill is to be presented for Royal Assent under the Parliament Act provided that one year has elapsed between Second Reading in the House of Commons in the first session and the date of the Bill*s passing the House of Commons in thesecond Session,,    This appears to contemplate that the Bill should have passed the House of Commons in only two Sessions and that it may be presented for Royal Assent in the second Session provided the necessaryconditions have been satisfied,,    But some doubt has been thrown on this bythe fact that section 2(3) of the Act of 1911 provides that a Bill is deemed tobe rejected by the House of Lords if it is not passed by that House eitherwithout amendment or with such amendments only as may be agreed by bothHotises.2,      This plainly poses the question of when the disagreement of the Houseof Lords is to be assumed if the Lords do not reject the Bill outright.    Canit be said that the Lords have failed to agree to a Bill until the Session Isfinally brought to an end by Prorogation?    If. this is indeed the effect ofsection 2(3), then the Bill would have to be reintroduced and passed by theHouse of Commons In a third Session,    Viscount Ullswaters who was the speaker of the House of Commons in 1911, suggested in his memoirs(&quot;A Speakers Commentaries&quot;, volume 2P page 112) that this was the correctview and claimed to be supported by the opinion of the Master of the Rollswhom he had consulted privately at the time,    in the event, this point has never been put to the test in the case of the three Bills which have so farbecome law under the Parliament Act procedure, each Bill having been returned to the House of Commons in time to enable the Speaker to give hiscertificate,,    I am myself disposed to think that Lord Ullswater was wrongsbut I cannot conceal that a difficult situation might arise If the matter wereever put to the test and the House of Lords placed difficulties in the way of aBilFs being returned to the House of Commons in time,3,      Moreover section 2(2) provides that when the Bill is presented forRoyal Assent &quot;there ehall be endorsed on the Bill the certificate of the speaker cf the House of Commons signed by him that the provisions of thissection have been complied with&quot;.    How does he certify it on the Bill if theBill is still in the House of Lords?    Viscount Ullswater says that In his case this difficulty did not arise because the Bill &quot;was returned to the commons (how or why this came to pass I have never been able to discover)&quot;,-4-
