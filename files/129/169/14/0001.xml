TRIBUNALS OF INQUIRYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. No Government pronouncement has yet been made on the reports ofthe Royal Commission on Tribunals of Inquiry (1966, Cmnd 3121) or theCommittee on the Law of Contempt as it affects Tribunals of Inquiry (1966,Cmnd 4078),    Lord Justice Salmon (as he then was) was Chairman of bothbodieso    The subject is complex and it seems desirable that theGovernment1 s conclusions should be made known in a White Paper.    Theattached draft, which takes account of experience gained from the Widgeryand Vehicle and General Tribunals, was approved by the Home and social affairs Committee on 26 Tanuary 1973; it incorporates amendments on thelines then suggested which have been agreed with the Department of Tradeand Industry.THE ROYAL COMMISSION2. The Royal Commission recommended the retention of the tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921, but made numerous detailed suggestions asto practice and procedure (listed in Appendix B to the draft White Paper).3.        Some two-thirds of these are acceptable: in particulari. that these Tribunals should be reserved for matters of vital public importance about which there is something of a nation-wide crisis of confidence and that care should be taken in.drawing up their terms of reference (Chapter H);ii. that there should be no appeal from the findings of a Tribunal.There was pressure for dais in the Debate on the Vehicle and GeneralReport, and Mr Maudling gave it a sympathetic reception, but wethink that the arguments in Chapter V against an appeal procedureare conclusive;iii. four of the six cardinal principles proposed by theCommission for the protection of witnesses.    These give witnessesa right to legal representation and, with certain qualifications, to payment of their costs (paragraphs 22 and 23 of the White Paper);and the rights to examination by their own solicitor or counsel, tohave other evidence called, and to have other witnesses cross-examined by their own counsel or solicitor (paragraphs 25-28).1CP(73) 54 COPY NO      669 April 1973CABINET
4, On the other hand, two of the cardinal principles, concerning theinvolvement of witnesses and the making of allegations, can be acceptedonly in the spirit and not in the letter, for the reasons stated inparagraphs 18-21,    It is impossible to eliminate, as the Commissionrecognised, all risk of injustice and hurt to individuals in proceedings ofthis kindk    That is why they should be used sparingly,5. The Law Officers agree that the Commission^ recommendation thatTribunals should nominate counsel other than a Law Officer to act on their behalf is not acceptable as it stands (paragraph 16),6,        Seven recommendations (listed in Chapter VI) require legislation.They amount to glosses on the 1921 Act rather than a new code ofprocedure and are not pressing.THE DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE7. The Committee was set up because of criticism of a suggestion made by the then Attorney General that public comment on matters whichit was the function of the Aberfan Tribunal to investigate might be subjectto the law of contempt even in advance of the setting up of the Tribunal.The Committee concluded that the law of contempt applied to Tribunalsonce they had been set up, but made some suggestions for clarificationand modification (set out in Appendix C of the White Paper).    These are dealt with in Chapter IV,    We do not think the Press will quarrel with theproposals...NORTHERN IRELAND8. The Scarman and Widgery Tribunals were set up under the Act bythe Northern Ireland Government (the Widgery Tribunal jointly withWestminster).    In present circumstances, it seems better not to refer to northern Ireland specifically in the White Paper,CONSULTATION WITH CIVIL SERVICE UNIONS9.        The Committee thought that in view of the keen interest in Tribunalprocedures shown by the First Division Association of Civil Servants afterthe Vehicle and General Tribwoal, there would be advantage in the staff side being given an opportunity to comment in confidence on the Government1proposals before publication.    No-one else outside Government is being consulted, though others might consider that they had an equal interest inthe White Paper, and my colleagues may wish to reflect further before putting the Civil Service Staff Side in a privileged position,CONCLUSION10.       I ask my colleagues:i. To endorse the substance of the recommendations embodied in the draft White Paper and to agree that it should be published.ii. To agree in principle that legislation should be introduced,but without any commitment on timing, to deal with the matters setout in Chapter VI of the White Paper.R home Office9 April 1973 CONFIDENTIAL
DRAFT WHITE PAPER ON TRIBUNALS OF INQUIRY SET UP UNDER THE TRIBUNALSCP INQUIRY (EVIDENCE) ACT 1921CHAPTER 1 - introduction.     In February 1966 a Royal Commission was set up under the chairmanship of Lord Justice Salmon &quot;to review the working of the Tr-itunals of Inquiry(Evidence) Act 1921 and to consider whether it should be retained orreplaced by some other procedure, and, if retained, whether any changesarc necessary or desirable.&quot;    The report of this Commission was published in November I966 (Cmnd 3123).2.    While the previous Goverment was still considering the recommendations made by the Corsmission, there was criticism of a statement made in theHouse of Commons by the then Attorney General that comment in public on matters which it was the function of the Aberfan Tribunal to investigatemight be subject to the law of contempt.   Since this was not a matterconsidered by the Royal Commission a Departmental Committee, also underthe chairmanship of Lord Justice Salmon, was appointed in 1968 &quot;to inquire into the law of contempt as it affects comment on, or statement?about, matters referred to a tribunal of inquiry under the Tribunals of inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 and the interviev/ing of potential witnessesconcerning such matters&quot;.   It was then decided by the Government that action on the Royal Commissions recommendations should be delayed untilthe Committee&apos;s report was received so that all the matters relating toTribunals of Inquiry constituted under the 1921 Act could be considered together.   In this Paper all references to &quot;Tribunals&quot; and to &quot;tribunals of Inquiry&quot; are to Tribunals of Inquiry appointed under the Tribunals of inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921, and all references to an &quot;Inquiry&quot; are to an inquiry conducted by such a Tribunal.3.     The Committee reported in June 1?6? (Cmnd ^0?8) and the then HomoSecretary announced in the House of Commons that the Government thoughtthat in urine in! r thn CrmwW t+eo&apos; c. r^ftown^r!^ ations represented eti acceptablelimit to the operation of the law of contempt, that the matter would be.considered in greater do tail with Particular regard to whether legislation
was appropriate, and that a further statement would bo made.   In June 1971, thepresent Government appointed a Committee under the chairmanship of Lord JusticePhilliraore to consider the law and practice relating to contempt of court ingeneral.   The Committee has not yet reported, but it seems unlikely that its recommendations will significantly affect the conclusions of Lord Justice Salmon&apos;sCommittee in the restricted sphere of the law of contempt in its relation toTribunals.1*..     The purpose of this paper is to set out in detail the Government&apos;s views onthe recommendations of both the Ho3&apos;cl Commission and the Departmental Committeeand to describe the legislation necessary to put some of these recommendationsinto effect.   V/here legislation is not required, the Paper is intended to serve asa guide to future Tribunals in the conduct of their inquiries.   In the preparationof trxs Paper the Government has had the benefit of the nrlvine and Rxnerinncc ofLord Rfidgery, Mr Justice Scarman and Mr Justice James, each of whom has pcted as chairman of a recent Tribunal set up under the Act.5.     Appendix A to this Paper gives the text oi&apos; the Tribunals of Inquiry..... , \i,(Evidence) Act 1921 and Appendices B and C set out all the recommendations maderespectively by the Royal Commission and the Departmental Committee.   Charter IInf the Pc.pt,r* deals with recommendations which arc concerned with the aecointmentand uses of Tribunals of Inquiry.   Chapter III covers recommendations which relateto the procedure of Tribunals.   Chapter IV examines the application of the lav; ofcontempt and the publicity to be given to the work of Tribunals, Chapter V dealswith the question whether there should be an appeal from the findings of theTribunal.   Chapter VI sets out the points which require legislation.
CHAPTER II APPOINTMENT AMD USES 01-&apos; TRIBUNALS of INQUIRY6.     The Government accepts the recommendation of the Royal Commission that theuse of Tribunals of Inquiry should be limited to matters of vital public importanceconcerning which there is something of a nation-wide crisis of confidence whichrenders any other method of investigation inadequate.   It also accepts theunsuitability of certain other types of inquiry for dealing with matters of thiskind (Appendix E 1, 2, h, 5, 7, 8);   in particular, of the kind of secret inquiry,without formal procedures for taking evidence or examining witnesses, conducted inthe Profumo case, and notes the Commission1s recommendation that srch an inquiry should never again be set up (B6).7.     The Commission reported before the legislation providing for the appointmentof the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration was passed and it did net,therefore, consider his role in relation to Tribunals of Inquiry.   The function ofthe Parliamentary Commissioner is to investigate allegations of maladministrationby Government Departments and in normal circumstances he will be the person bestequipped to deal with allegations of this kind.   But there may still be circum-stances in which an allegation of maladministration by a Government Department is.or is linked with a matter, of such gravit3r that the appointment of a Tribunal of inquiry is necessary to allay public dic^uiet.8,     It is accepted that the power to set up a Tribunal should continue to beexercised only on a resolution of both Houses of Parliament (B 26).   The selection of persons to serve on the Tribunal should continue to rest, with the Governmentof the day and should not become a matter for public debate in Parliament (B 28).9.     The Commissions arguments in favour of terms of reference which are drawnprecisely enough to identify the specific matter which is causing a crisis ofpublic confidence, but not so narrowly that the Tribunal is fettered, are on^pn + o^   (ne r *    X-----  V -  -,c-i   J-&apos; I -
10.   The Government recognises the force of the Commission&apos;s arguments that theChairman ofthe Tribunal should he a person holding high judicial office (B 27).Not only should this serve to ensure that the Inquiry is conducted impartially anefficiently, and the judicious exercise of the Tribunal&apos;s powers of compulsion,but such a person should be best able, through the experience of his office,  toprotect the interests of witnesses in circumstances and procedures which arestrange to many in this country, and inherently difficult.   The Government agrees that in most cases it would be right to follow this recommendation.   nevertheless it thinks there would he advantage in allowing an exception to be made in aparticular case if there were unusual circumstances to warrant it.11.   The&apos;Government considers that there would normally be advantage, and cspeciaso when the tribunal is inquiring into the conduct of members of aparticular service, profession or calling, or where it is required to deal withissues of a specialised, technical nature, in its including persons, other thanlawyers, with relevant experience or qualifications.
WAI iiMt Hi rivUubiJUiiiijo Or TniiJUItALoThe need for flexlbilitv12.   It follows from the prerequisite that Tribunals should be set upority sparingly and in very special circumstances that their subject matter is liable to be specialised and highly variable.   The approach and procedure will, therefore, need to be adapted to the special characterof the inquiry.     The need for maximum flexibility and the desire toavoid any unnecessary delay which might be caused by alleged breaches of statutory Rules are accepted as strong reasons for not having statutoryRules of Procedure for Tribunals of Inquiry (325).   The Gcvarnnnrit considersthat with the Report of the Royal Commission and this White Paper to guidethem, Tribunals can be relied upon to follow acceptable procedures without being bound by any rigid and detailed code of procedure.Pre 1 ircl r.ory arra ngements13.   The Goverment agrees with the Commission that any kind of preliminaryhearing of evidence in private, whether by some agency   other than aTribrjial of Inquiry to decide whether there is sufficient material for investigation by a Tribunal, or by the Tribunal itself to decide whether there is a prima facie case against any of the persons concerned, wouldbe inappropriate (B 35). (This would not prevent the Government of theday from causing an informal inquiry to be made before it moved a resolution to set up a Tribunal under the Act.) The Commisicn recommends instead that more time should be given to the preparation of an Inquiry before publichearings begin,/B 10) and that this time should be used to defineallegations and to discard irrelevant material (B 35).   The Govermentaccepts these recommendations as objectives to be achieved to the greatestextent practicable (paragraphs 18-20).
14.   The Government also accepts that the Tribunal should hold one or morepreliminary meetings in public at the earliest opportunity to explain itsinterpretation of itn terms of reference and to give directions as toprocedure and intended lines of inquiry (B 34, 40).   V,&apos;here the terms oTreference contain words the construction of which is open to argument, theTribunal should decide whether or not to hear arguments on behalf of interested persons and by counsel for the Tribunal before announcing theinterpretation to be adopted.   The Tribunal should also deal with applicatiorfor representation.   The more clearly it is possible to set out in thepreliminary meetings the main issues likely to arise in the course of thoInquiry, the easier it will be on the one hand for the Tribunal to identify the interested parties and the nature of their interest; to identify possibleallegations and to decide questions of representation! and on the other hand for the potential witness to prepare his case.Legal representation of the Tribunal1?,   It is agreed that in England and Wales the Treasury Solicitor should ccnain.to be appointed as the solicitor acting for the Tribunal (B36) and that inScotland   it would be preferable for the Tribunal to be represented officiallyrather than by a private firm of solicitors: the choice would normally lie between the Crown Agent and the Solicitor to the Secretary of State forScotland,16.   The Commission recommends that the Tribunal should nominate counselother than a Law Officer of the Crown to act on its behalf (B.38 and B.39).The Government considers, however, that the Tribunal should be free to chooseits own counsel, and should neither be restricted in its choice to counselother than a Law Officer of the Crown, nox- be obliged to select a Law Officer.The Tribunal should consult the Attorney General or the Lci^d Advocate before deciding whether or not a Law Officer should appear, and also aboxit the choice of other nounnel for tiio Tribunals    If it ie decided that c LawOfficer should appear,   he might take a full part in the proceedings,or he might in appru px-ia te cases confine his appearance to opening theparticular lo^u^a involved in the terms of reference, and thereafter being6
available to the Tribunal to deal with specific matters such as contempt,waiver of Crown privilege and the grant of immunity from prosecution,Accordinglyf the Government does not accept the Commissions recoramendatiin this matter (B 38 and B 39).
The six cardinal principles17.   The Commission accepts that the risks of hurt and injustice to personsinvolved in an Inquiry are inherent in, and cannot be eliminated from, anyprocedure which is effective for arriving at the truth.   However, it sets out cardinal principles to be strictly observed to minimise those risks (B3).These are:-(i) Before any person becomes involved in an Inquiry, the Tribunalmust be satisfied that there are circumstances which affect him andwhich the Tribunal proposes to investigate,(ii) Before any person who is involved in an Inquiry is called as awitness he should be informed of any allegations which are made against him and the substance of the evidence in support of them.(iii) (a)   He should be given an adequate ODOortunity of nreparing his case and of being assisted by legal advisers.(b)   His legal expenses should normally be met out of public fluids.(iv) He should have the opportunity of being examined by his own solicited:or counsel and of stating his case in public at the Inquiry.(v) Any material witnesses he wishes called at the Inquiry should, ifreasonably practicable, be heard.(vi) He should have the opportunity of testing by cross-exam: nationconducted by his own solicitor or counsel any evidence which may affecthim.The Government accepts that the six principles, and the recommendations which give substance to them (B12 - B21^ should be used as guide-lines to befollowed wherever it is practicable to do so; but it considers that there willbe circiHiiKtances in which certain of the principles will be capable of beingobserved only in the spirit, and not in the letter, as appears from thefollowing comments,(i) Involvement in an Inquiryin the Inquiry; between the giving of a statement to the solicitor to the4 x X uiuicix   cuiu. ta,pj;trcll au^c;   ct 5  tx   n.i uucoo   uciuic   ouc   4xj.uu-ii1.-vx   j uoull 1 u   w*wr-&quot;     8
beginning of an Inquiry the Tribunal will normally call on all personswho think thoy may have evidence relevant to the Inquiry to inform theSecretary of the Tribunal, indicating the nature of that evidence.It is the duty of the solicitor to the Tribunal to interview and obtainstatements from these and other persons who have information relevant tothe Inquiry,Crhe Tribunal decides in the light of these statements which persons shouldbe called as witnesses to give evidence and what material is extraneous tothe Inquiry and can be excluded from it.   It is therefore nomal-and, indeed,inevitable that many more persons should give statements to the solicitorto the Tribunal than eventually appear as witnesses before it and since boththe statements and the fact that a person has given a statement remainconfidential, there should be no risk of injustice or loss of reputationinvolved in this preliminary sifting process,9* SuDject to this, the Government agrees that before ihe Tribunal hears evidence from a witness in an Inquiry, it should be satisfied that there are circum-stances which affect him and which the Tribunal proposed to investigate(B3(i))But a person&apos;s involvement will not always depend on the Tribunal,   He mayask pcr^jLSsxon to be represented because he considers himself at risk Oxbeing prejudicially affected by the inquiry or he may be mentioned by anotherwitness in evidence.   Y/hile, therefore, the Tribunal must be generallyresponsible for deciding who should be interviewed and asked for statements&apos;,what material should be excluded, and who should be prevented from beingunnecessarily involved, these questions may not always be entirely-within its control. Some related aspects of the question of the involvement of witnesses are dealt with in paragraphs 29 and 30 below,(ii) Making of allegations20.  The principle that a person who is called beforetheTribunal shouldbe informed in advance 01 the allegations agamsi mm and thu substance ofthe evidence in support of them (B3(ii)) is a desirable objective tut raisc-oa number of difficult issues in practice.   For instance, the very nature oftiscInquiry under its terras of reference may be an investigation of what if9
any allegation^ can be made and proved against whom:   in thiimm-* tnay   well  be impossible to identify at the stage before evidence is called either the precise nature of the allegations or the persons against whom allegations can be made.   Secondly^it is not justifiable to make&quot;fishing&quot; allegations against individuals, groups or bodies without suppor-ting evidence of fault.   Thirdly, witnesses cannot be given advance noticeof what another witness may intend to say or copies of another witness1sstatement without the latter&apos;s consent.   Similarly, witnesses cannot havean unqualified right to such information because it is essential that theTribunal should have discretion not only as to the form of disclosure (B13)but also as to the matter to be disclosed.   It is an important duty of theTribunal to exclude material that is extraneous to the investigation,but this is often a difficult line to draw;, the Tribunal must retain full responsibility and discretion as to where it is drawn and what evidence is used.   This is another important safeguard against a person becoming involved unnecessarily in an Inquiry,21,  The Government suggests that the course to be adopted should be asfollows.   Vi1ien.it is practicable to do so.the Tribunal should inform anyperson called as a witness who is likely to have allegations made against him of the nature of those allegations, insofar as it is known, and of thesubstance of the evidence in support of them.   That information when it is available should be given in writing before such a person is called to give evidence and he should be given an adequate opportunity of obtaining legal advice and of preparing his case beforehand.   In any event, where fresh evidence]or allegations emerge in the course of an inquiry the person likely to be concerned should be given a comparable opportunity (so far as consistent with the nnod to avoid prolonging the proceedings to an extent prejudicial to thepublic interest or tho interests of other persons involved) of obtaining legaladvico and of preparing his case before having to deal with such evidence andallegations,,(ill)(a) ,Lfijffl1   renr;i*.jutiOU of WJtnO3.S0322,   The next ox&quot; the Coimaiasion&apos;3 cardinal principles is that a witness shouldhave adequate opportunity of preparing his case and of being assisted by legal advisers unu tliut Lio legal expenses should normally be met cut of public funds (B;j(,iii)),   The Government accepts the Commission&apos;s recommendation
that the 1921 Act should be amended so that anyone called as a witnessshould have the right to be legally represented (B15),   It considers thatit should ultimately be a matter for the witness&apos;s own choice whether heshould be represented separately or with others, and that considerations ofpublic cost should not be allowed to prejudice that decision; but that theright to representation should be qualified by a discretion in the tribunal to ascertain and prescribe the particular issues in which the applicantfor representation is an interested person.   The Tribunal should also havea discretion to allow anyone to be legally represented who is not a witnessbut who claims to be an interested person in that he is at risk of beingprejudicially affected by the Inquiry (316).(iii) (b) Payment of witnesses&apos; costst-j tt    111c ou-aiiiiooiuji 1 eCuiiu-ienua   Wicio   1.11c; nUli  suoujlu.  ut: duiciiuuu  bo at-include a provision empoY/ering the Tribunal to order payment ofall or any proportion of a witness&apos;s costs out of public funds and that once the Tribunal had made an Order for costs in favourof a witness, he should receive them as of right and not ey gratia (319).It also recommends that the relevant statutes and regulations should be amended to enable tie Tribunal to grant legal aid to a witness whose financialposition qualified him for it (321).   While the Government agrees that itshould be possible for witnesses to recover costs as of right and not exgratia &quot;as at present (319)i it thinks that the best way of achieving thisis to enable the Tribunal to make orders as to costs at the outset of its proceedings, or, in the case of a witness who became connected with the inquiry at a later stage, in time for that witness to be able to count onan order before making his arrangements for representation.   The power tomn)ce an advance order for cbstSj which will require legislation, will be as effective for the purpose of providing legalrepresentation as the power to grant legal aid, but will be less complicated and will avoid introducing attributes of the legal aid scheme into theTribunal urocedure.
?.&apos;:,.   The Government shares the commission s views on how the Tribunal&apos;a discretion in respect of costs should be exercised,except that the discretion proposed to begiven to the Tribunal to prescribe the particular issues on which an applicantfor representation is an interested party should dispose of the need for costs tobe withheld on grounds of unnecessary or frivolous representation.   The Tribunalwill nevertheless still require power fcr other reasons, such as deliberateobstruction or unwarranted delay by a witness, to revoke or suspend costs alreadypranted (B 20), and the level and extent of reimbursement will be subject tc the discretion of the Tribunal.(iv) Examination bv cwn solicitor or counsel25e   The Government accepts the Commissions recommendation^ (B 17) that where awitness is legally represented, he should be examined by his own counsel orsolicitor on his statement to the solicitor to the Tribunal.   It also agrees thata witness should, if he wishes and time permits, have his own legal adviserpresent when his statement is taken by the Treasury Solicitor.26a   The Government accepts that wheii a witness is not represented, he should be examined and re-examined by one of the counsel for the Tribunal and that no witnessshould be examined and cross-examined by the same counsel.(v) Eight to .na ve. ojb her evide nee c a lied.27c-   The Government accepts the Commission&apos;s recommendation that, subject to the discretion of the Tribunal, a witness should have the right to have evidence called on his behalf by counsel for the Tribunal (3 18).(vi) Cross-examination of other witnesses by own counsel or solicitor28.   The Commission envisaged that the Tribunal should give leave, in itsdiscretion, to counsel representing interested persons to cross-examine a witnessafter he had been cross-examined by counsel for the Tribunal and before he was finally re-examined by his own counsel.   This is acceptable.Revela Lion of sources2^   The Commission recommended, in the context of evidence given by tbs Press^that Tribunals should insist on the revelation of sources of information only where this was of vital importance,and thuI they should then explain fully to the witnesse----...1^      uiiU-tiij. Oi&apos;da i/xwii was vitai.
to the I,enquiry (B46).   This recommendation also has some relevar.ee tothe question of the necessary involvement of witnesses (paragraph 18 above)The Goverment accepts this recommendation, both in its application to thePress and in its wider implications.Reporting of unfounded allegations30.   The Government fully supports the Co^rniission&apos;s recommendation   that theTribunal   should give particular emphasis in   its  report to cases whereallegations against witnesses or interested persons are shown to beunfounded (B49).   This is a natural corollary to the concern that no oneshould be involved unnecessarily.Criminal records31 *    The Commission recommends thai the criminal records of personsinvolved in the Inquiry should be made pvaiiabie to tne Tribunal, which wil.ldecide in its discretion whether such evidence may be used in cross-examination (B24).   The Government accepts the Commissions arguments infavour of this recommendation and agrees that particulars of any previousconvictions should be given to the Tribunal.   The 1921 Act will accordingly be amended to provide statutory authority for providing the Tribunal withthis information.Other matters concerning the conduct of the Inquiry32,  The Government agrees that the Tribunal should decide, in its discretion,whether an opening statement should be made by counsel appearing for itand that counsel for any witness should have the opportunity of making ashort speech following the opening speech by counsel for the Tribunal(B23)*33*   All witnesses are the Tribunal&apos;s witnesses and the order in whichthey are called and in which interested persons put their case must be foroiie   ixXuuiK^i.  0  decision.     ocvvt-&apos;  ill OxUitax  ujixuuitio u^illuu&amp;f    i^ne ixjiaxspeech should be made by counsel for the Tribunal.34.  The Tribunal should decide, in its discretion, whether a witnessagainst whom allegations hn&apos;,re been made in the course of the Inquiry should^t* ti* 1.1 r*n&quot;i ritO \/ ^p iua i *4 not separately represented   bo given ihe opportunity
to make a short statement at the close of his evidence to bring out anyrelevant factors v/hich have not been dealt with during his evidence.Iiataunitioa35.,   The Government accepts, and intends to bring into effect by amendments to the 1921 Act, the recommendations of the Commission that members of tribunials should have immunity, similar to that enjoyed by a Superior Courtof Record- for anything said by them in the course of the Inquiry or intheir report (B29) and that solicitors, counsel and others should haveimmunity for what they may say before the Tribunal (B31).56.   Section 1(3) of the 1921 Act   entitles a witness to the same immunities and privileges as if he were a witness before the High Court or  the Courtof Session.   The Commission recommended that the witness^ immunity should beextended so that neither his evidence or statement to the solicitor to theTribunal, nor documents he is required to produce, shall be used against him in subsequent civil or criminal proceedings except where he is charged withgiving false evidence before the Tribunal, or with conspiring with orprocuring others to do so.   The Commission recognised that if a witness was granted immunity as far as the use of his evidence in any subsequent civil or criminal proceedings against him was concerned, it would be difficult for him to refuse to answer any question on the ground that it might tend toincriminate Mm.   This proposal is acceptable.A ccojfunqdati on37*   The Government accepts its responsibility for providing adequateaccommodation for the Tribunal (B41).
CHAPTER IV PUBLICITY AND THE LAW OF CONTEMPTDiscretion of Tribunals to sit in private3.8*  Section 2 of the 1921 Act prohibits the exclusion of the publicfrom hearings &quot;unlecs in the opinion of the Tribunal it is in thepublic interest expedient so to do for reasons connected with thesubject matter of tho inquiry or the nature of the evidence to begiven&quot;.   In the past this has been interpreted as requiring hearingsexceptto be held in public/when this would constitute a security risk.39. The Government recognises the force of the Commission&apos;6arguments in favour of allowing the Tribunal a wider discretion to hear evidence in private and accepts both   its   recommendation thatthe Tribunal should have this wider discretion (B^D) and   its   viewthat section 2 can be interpreted as giving the Tribunal power to hear evidence in private in all the circumstances where this might beconsidered necessary.   The Government sees no reason why futureTribunals need regard themselves as fettered by the practice oftheir predecessors in this respect and accordingly does not thinkthat the law needs amending in order to allow them this greater freedom.]iO*   Since, in spite of this wider discretion, inquiries v/ill stillordinarily be held in public, it seems right that those members ofthe public not able to attend the hearings in person should beentitled to be kept informed by tho Press of what is taking place.The Government therefore accepts the recommendation that procpedingsshould be conducted generally in public and reported day by day inthe Press (Bnp).41* It is unlikely that anyone would dissent from the recommendation that the greatest care should be taken by the Press when reportingcare ^**0U-Ld to Cvccrcis^d      pr^.*ju ^cpwx uu durxng        ^ia^w m,
the announcement of a decision to set up the Tribunal and the actualhearings, particularly in relation to the comments of persons whoare likely to be asked to give evidence to the Tribunal.   For in theimmediate afternath of the kind of event that leauts to the settingup of the Tribunal, the persons concerned may not yet have had time toconsider fully either what they are saying or the implications ofsaying it.   The character and career of an individual may sufferirreparable damage by the publicity given to his remarks and the truth may be unintentionally concealed by an ill-considered statement to the Press that the person concerned may later find it embarrassing to retract.42.   All these considerations apoly equally to the other mass mediaof communication, broadcasting and television,.   While free reportingin the Press, broadcasting or television must not in any way befettered, those concerned in all these media should beat- in mind howmujh harm to the individual and damage to the interests of justicecan be done by carelessness and thoughtlessness when reporting eventsduring this critical period.Limitations imposed by the law of contempt43*   The Government accepts without reservation the assumption whichwas implicit in the report of the Royal Commission and made explicitin the first recommendation of the Departmental Committee, that thelaw of contempt does apply to Tribunals of Inquiry.   The committee recommended however that the law of contempt should not prohibit orcurtail any comment at any time about the subject matter of the inquiry (Cj5).   This is in keeping with the principle that there shouldbe free reporting of the proceedings and the Government accepts itfully, subject to the two following recommendations (C&apos;t , ) that itshould bo a contempt if any person after the Tribunal is appointedsays or decs anything, or causes anything to be said or dons, in
relation to any evidence relevant to the subject matter of the inquiry which is intended or obviously likely to alter, distort,destror withhold such evidence from the Tribunal, and that the chairman ofthe Tribunal in his discretion may make a request that no interview with certain named persons whom he regards as especially vulnerableshall be published, without imposing a legal obligation to complywith such a request.   As the Committee says, anyone who ignored sucha request would know that he was treading on dangerous ground and legsanctions other than those available under the law of contempt areunnecessary.Application of the law of contemptkU,  In the Government&apos; s view there can also be no doubt aboir^ theCommittee&apos;s recommendation that the low of contempt should apply only as from the date of the instrument appointing the Tribunal(C2).   It is difficult to see how a contempt can be committed inrelation to a non-eristent body; and although there may be a riskof undesirable publicity between the time when the intention to setup the Tribunal has been announced and its appointment. theGovernment agrees with the Committee that this is a price worthpaying in return for certainty as to the moment at which commentatorsare at risk: a moment which, as the Committee points out, should not depend on anything go unpredictable as to whether at some future date a Tribunal will be appointed under the 1921 Act.45o Section 1(2) (c) of the 1921 Actprowhs -that any person may be punished by the High Court, or in Scotland the Court of Session, asif he had been guilty of contempt of the court if he does anything which would, if the Tribunal had been a court of law having powerto commit for contemnt, have been contempt of that court.   In viewof this, the Government considers that the Committee16 recommendation
that any unjustifiable attack upon the integrity of any member ofthe Tribunal in his capacity as a member of the Tribunal (C6) andthat anything said or done in the face of the Tribunal which would,if the Tribunal had been a court of law having power to commit forcontempt, have been contempt of court (C7) should be a contempt,describes the effect of the existing law, having regard to the. terms of section 1(2) of the Act.46**   The Government does not share the view of the Committee (C8)that section 1(2) of the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921needs to be amended to put the recommendations relating to contemptinto effect.   One disadvantage of attempting to clarify this sectionas proposed by the Committee is that what is not specificallyincluded in the section will be assumed to be excluded, which means that a Tribunal would be powerless to deal with any unforeseencircumstances which might arise.   The most substantial amendment would be the proposed addition to section 1(2) of the subsectionrelating specifically to anything said or done which is &quot;intendedor obviously likely&quot; to alter, distort, destroy or withhold evidence from the Tribunal.   But the question whether any particular statement or action is intended or obviously likely to do anything ic so mucha matter for subjective judgment that it seems unlikely that bucha provision would afford any real guidance as to the circumstances in which a contempt would be committed.   If a provision could be drafewhich had the clement of certainty necessary to offer such guidance,it would have the disadvantage just described; unless it introducesthe element of certainty it is superfluous.47*    In these circumstances, the Government considers that the 1921Act is better left unamended, especially since future Tribunals willhave the benefit of the Committee&apos;s report to serve as a guide tothem when they are considering wh^thpr any particular action shouldbe treated as a contempt.
Procedure for committal for contempt43.  The Government agrees with the Royal Commission that the present procedure whereby casec of contempt are referred to the High Court orthe Court of Session on the certificate of the Tribunal shouldcontinue to be followed (B^7) and that questions concerning committalfor contempt should in no circumstances be referred back toParliament (B48).
CHAPTER V -SHOULD THERE BE AN APPEAL FROM THE FEEDINGS OF THE TRIBUNAL?49s   The main argument which has been put forward for allowing a right of appeal from the findings of the Tribunal is that an adverse finding is attended by morepublicity and is potentially more catastrophic than an adverse finding in thecourts, where there is appellate procedure.   On the other hand, the weight ofopinion generally in the past has been against the creation of such, a right andthe Commission itself recommends against this (B 50) for three reasons.   it considers, first,  that these Tribunals have no questions of law to decide.Secondly, that any adverse finding which a Tribunal may make against persons will depend on what evidence the Tribunal believes and that it would be impossible to reverse such findings without setting up another Tribunal to hear the evidence allover again.   Thirdly, that it is of the utmost importance that finality should hereached and- confidence restored with the publication of the Report.50s    After careful consideration the Government has decided that: the argumentsthe first two in particular,against allowing a right of appeal/are conclusive.   Tribunals are ordinarilyappointed hot to e-xucidate the lav/ but to establish facts,  so that a right ofappeal on a point of law would be largely irrelevant.   If such a right wereconceded on questions of fact it is indeed difficult to see how it would bepossible for an appeal to be decided without retraversing the whole, or thegreater part, of the evidence;   and apart from the very serious objections which.the Commission see in this the existence of such, a right would almost inevitably lead to demands for the rules of evidence and procedure of the Tribunal to beformulised in a manner which would destroy the flexibility of approach &quot;Which theGovernment consider to be essential in proceedings of this kind.   Where dis-satisfaction is expressed at a Tribunal&apos;s findings it is liable to focus not somuch on questions of law, or strictly of fact, but on whether any strictures whichmay appear in the report arc truly warranted by the facts adduced;   and this is averdict wnieu snoulu properi^ w -us a o, u\j o lu mi appcax ouuj, uuc to 1 ax Aiomcuu,to which tno reports arc presented ana 07/ which it is customary 1      them to 00uebuLed.

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND 11K GO M M KN D ATIONSJ. There is a need for standing legislation to permit the setting-up when-ever necessary of an inquisitorial tribunal (paragraph 2(V), and for thi^purpose .se the&apos;Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act. 1921, subject lo certain amendments and safeguards, should be retained2. The Act should not be invoked for matters of local or minor importance,but confined to circumstances which occasion a nation-wide ciisis of con-fidence  3. The following cardinal principles should be observed to minimise the risk of personal hurl and injustice lo any person involved inthe inquiries:  (i) Before any person becomes involved in an inquiry, the Tribunal mustbe satisfied that there are circumstances which affect him and whichthe Tribunal proposes to investigate.(ii) llefore any person who is involved in an inquiry is called as a witness,he should be informed in advance of allegations against him andthe substance of the evidence in support of them.(iii) (a) i)e should have adequate opportunity of preparing his case andof being assisted by legal advisers.(b) His legal expenses should normally be met out of public funds.(iv) lie should have the opportunity of being examined by his ownsolicitor or counsel and of stating his case in public at the inquiry.(v) Any material witnesses he wishes called at the inquiry should, ifreasonably practicable, be heard.(vi) Kc should have the opportunity of testing by cross-examinationconducted by his own solicitor or counsel any evidence which may affect him.4. Investigation by Royal Commission would not afford a practicable alternative lo procedure under the Act of 19215. Investigation of allegations of public misconduct should be free ofpolitical influence and Select Parliamentary Committees of Inquiry would accordingly be inappropriate for dealing with circumstances hitherto dealtwith under the Act6. No Government should in future set up a tribunal of the type adoptedin the Profumo case to investigate any matter causing nation-wide public concern. 7. The procedure followed by Departmental and Accident Inquiries wouldnot be suitable for dealing with the special type of case which the Act was designed to meet8. Inquiry by the Security Commission could not be regarded as a suitablealternative lo inquiry by a 1921 Aci Tribunal9. Should the Security Commission or any other body require powersof compulsion similar to those provided by ihe Act, they should be furnished by separate enactment10. More time than has been allowed in the past should be given tothe preparation of an inquiry before public hearings begin
11. a witness should, if lie wishes, have his own legal adviser present when his statement is taken by the treasury solicitor. before giving his evidence i;i public, a witness should be supplied witha document $citing out the allegations against him, and the subsiar.ee of theevidence in support of those allegations13. the form of disclosure of evidence to a witness should be in the discretion of the tribunal ; and where fresh evidence or allegations emergein the course of tiie inquiry, the persons concerned should be given adequateopportunity fur meeting the new situation14. in scotland, a procedure similar to that followed in england, shouldbe adopted to permit the tribunal to sec the precognitions of witnesses15. the act should he amended so that anyone called as a witness wouldhave the right to be legally represented16. the tribunal should have a discretion to allow anyone to be legallyrepresented who is not a witness, but who claims to be an interested person in that he is at risk of being prejudicially affected by the inquiry. &apos;17. when a witness is legally represented, he should be examined by hisown solicitor or counsel on his statement to the treasury solicitor. whenhe is not represented, he should be examined by one of the counsel appearingfor the tribunal. no witness should be examined and cross-examined by thesame counsel18. subject to the discretion of the tribunal, a witness should have theright to have evidence called on his behalf by counsel for the tribunal19. the act should be amended so as to include a provision empowering the tribunal to order payment of a \vilness&apos;s costs out of public funds athis would enable witnesses to receive costs as of right and not cx gratia20. the tribunal should deprive a witness of all or part of his costs if,in their view, there are good grounds for doing so,21. the relevant statutes and regulations should be amended so as to permit a tribunal to grant legal aid,22. the act should be amended so as to extend the present immunityconferred on a witness so that neither his evidence, nor statement to thetreasury solicitor, nor documents he is required to produce shall be used against him in subsequent civil or criminal proceedings except where he is charged with giving false evidence before the tribunal, or conspiring with or procuring others to do so .23. the tribunal should decide, in its discretion, whether an openingstatement should be made by counsel appearing for it ; and counselfor any witness should have the opportunity of making a short speechfollowing the opening speech by counsel for the tribunal -24. criminal records of persons involved should be made available to thetribunal, who will decide in their discretion whether such evidence may beused in cross-examination -.
25. There -should be no statutory rules of procedure, but Tribunals shouldillovv (lie general principles laid down in this report.2ft. The present procedure whereby the power to set up ;i Tribunal canbe exercised only on a resolution of both I louses of Parliament should heretainedl1?. The Acl should he amended so as to provide thai the Chairman of a tribunal must be a person holding high judicial office ; no requirement shouldbe laid down as to the status or qualifications of the. remaining members,but the possibility of a non-legal appointment should he considered *28. Members of a Tribunal should not be named or debated in thepassage of the resolution through Parliament29. The Act should bo amended to provide immunity lor members of tribunials, similar to that enjoyed by a Superior Court of Record, for anythingsaid by them in the course of the inquiry or in their report.&apos;30. Consideration should be given to conferring a similar immunity onpersons appointed to conduct a Departmental inquiry.31. The Act should be amended to provide immunity for solicitors andcounsel and others for what they may say before a Tribunal of Inquiry32. The terms of reference of Tribunals should be drawn as preciselyas possible33. Tribunals should not be set up to investigate vague and unspecifiedrumours ; equally, they should not bo fettered by terms of reference whichare too narrowly drawn34. Tribunals should explain in  public their interpretation of their terms of reference at the earliest opportunity35. A preliminary hearing of evidence in private, whether by the TribunalJor another agency ) would be inappropriate.The Tribunal should be afforded ample opportunity to define the alienationsand discard irrelevant material before public hearings begin36. The Treasury Solicitor should continue to be appointed as the solicitoracting for the Tribunal.37. In Scotland, it would be preferable for the Solicitor for the ScottishDepartment or the Procurator Fiscal to act for the Tribunal rather than aprivate firm of solicitors38. The Tribunal should nominate counsel other than a Law Officer ofthe Crown&quot; to be instructed by the Treasury Solicitor and to act on its behalf39. It would be preferable for Tribunals in Scotland to be represented by independent counsel rather than the Lord Advocate or Solicitor-General40. The Tribunal should, at a preliminary meeting in public, give itsinterpretation of its terms of reference, and give directions as to procedure and intended lines of inquiry..41. Adequate accommodation should be provided for the inquiry
42. One of the team of counsel acting on behalf of the. Tribunal shouldvaihblc lo examine and re-examine any witness not legally represented43. Proceedings should be conducted generally in public and reported day by clay in the Press44. The Press should exercise extreme care in reporting proceedings45. Discretion of Tribunals to sit in private should be interpreted toextend beyond the hearing of evidence which would constitute a securityrisk; but nevertheless to be exercised with reluctance and only in most exceptional circumstances&apos;46. Tribunals lo insist on revelation of sources of information only where&quot;tf vital importance, and to explain fully lo witnesses concerned why !hc^formation is vital to. the inquiry.47. Present procedure whereby cases of contempt arc referred to Iho HighCourt on the certificate of a Tribunal should continue to be followed48. Questions concerning committal for contempt should in no circunvstances be referred back lo Parliament49. Tribunals to give particular emphasis in their report to cases whereallegations against witnesses or interested persons arc shown to be unfounded50. There should  be no appeal  from the findings of a Tribunal
SUMMARY 01*&apos; CONCLUSIONS AND RKCOMMENOATIONS1. The law of contempt in a clarified and modified form should continue toapply to Tribunals of Inquiry appointed under the Act of 1921 (paragraph 21).?.. The law of contempt should apply only as from the associate of the instrumentappointing the Tribunal (paragraph 24).3. The law of contempt in its application to Tribunals of Inquiry should notprohibit or curtail any comment at any lime about the subject matter of the inquiry (paragraph 26).4. It should be a contempt if any person after a Tribunal is appointed saysor does anything,-or causes anything lo be said or done, in relation to any evidence relevant to the subject matter of the Inquiry which is intended orobviously likely to alter, distort, destroy or withhold such evidence from theTribunal (paragraphs 32 and 41).5. The chairman of a Tribunal in his discretion may make a request thatno interview with certain named persons whom he regards as especially vulner-ablc shall bo published without imposing a legal obligation to comply v, ith such a request (paragraph 33).6. Any unjustifiable attack upon the integrity of any member of the Tribunalin bis capacity as a member of the Tribunal should be a contempt (paragraphs36 and 41). .7. Anything said or done in the face of the Tribunal which would, if theTribunal had been a court of law having power to commit for contempt havebeen contempt of court should be punishable as a contempt (paragraphs 37 and40.S. The Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921 should be amended inorder to carry out the foregoing recommendations (paragraph 41).
