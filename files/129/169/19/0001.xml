GOVERNMENT DISPERSAL: THE HARDMAN report memorandum by the Secretary of State for Trade and industry. I am concerned that the proposals in the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s paper on the Hardman Report (CP(73) 57) may overlook some of the regionalaspects of the exercise directed to the dispersal of Government.2.        There are two aspects to the problem of Civil Service dispersal:the managerial issues and the issues of regional policy.    In consideringthe Hardman proposals we should give full weight to the politicalexpectations that have been created as well as to the factors affectingmanagement in the Civil Service.3.        From the regional policy angle I do not believe that anything onthe lines of the &quot;recommended&quot; solution is adequate.    We have accepted a responsibility for improving the economy of the regions and for devolvingfunctions of Government to them.    We have here an opportunity to moveover 20,000 jobs, including policy-making jobs, to the assisted regions.If we reject the opportunity we shall be doing double harm to the regionsbecause inevitably we shall inhibit movement in the private sector.    both employers and employees will conclude that if longer-range movement isunacceptable to us it would be unacceptable for them.    We must demon-strate our confidence in our regional policies and honour our commitments to the regions by seeing that a really substantial share of the dispersal i3 tothe assisted areas.    The &quot;recommended&quot; solution simply does not do this.4. I suggest that we should in the first instance take a view on whatwould be an acceptable scale of dispersal to the assisted areas.    If wecannot go quite as far as the &quot;regional solution&quot;, we should ask officials to consider urgently what modifications to that solution are necessary inthe light of special Departmental needs and practical difficulties.Consultation with Staff Sides would of course be essential before firm decisions were taken.CP(73) 59 COPY NO 6630 April 1973CABINET
5. On one important point the Hardman Report is, I think, mistaken.It says that the loss to efficiency entailed in dispersal tends to beproportionate to the distance from London.    Whatever assumptionhas to be made for publication, it is not the case that travel by senior officials is undertaken exclusively in working hours.    Officials based in Scotland or the North of England can and do travel overnight and putin a full day!s work either side of their journey.    Given this pattern of travelling it may even be more efficient to disperse to the distant regionsthan to areas requiring a shorter journey that would have to be in working hours.6.        But even if there were somo loss of efficiency in the work of theCivil Service through dispersal to more distant regions, I consider thatwe should accept it as we have asked private companies to accept it, forthe sake of correcting regional imbalance.    The job of getting that rightis substantial.    We have shown that we believe it to be important and weare spending a lot of money to achieve it.    We may lose a great deal ofgood will if the public get the idea that we are not prepared to apply our policies to ourselves.P w department of Trade and Industry30 April 1973
