I    tLAND AND HOUSE PRICES;  NEW HOUSING POLICIES - costs and OFFSETTING SAVINGSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment, The proposed new housing measures, not including mortgagestabilisation, are estimated to involve expenditure rising from  24 million in 1973-74 to  181 million in 1977-78.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury, has accepted that about one-third of these costs is likely to be offset byconsequential reductions in the level of local authority housing expenditure.I for my part have agreed to make savings in other Department of the environment programmes to meet the remaining costs     These are asfollow s:1973-74 1974-75 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 16m  44m  74m  110m  120m2. My colleagues will wish to know how the savings are to be made.I propose in the first place to cut the trunk road programme by about 7 percent over the period.    This should produce  120 million in all and approximately  50 million per annum by 1977-78.    The effect willbe to delay completion of the strategic inter-urban network by about two years.    The Governments stated intention was to complete the network by the &apos;early 1980s1 and this will now not be possible.    ButI would prefer to delay any public announcement on this subject untilI can be more definite about which schemes will have to be delayed.Urgent improvements will continue to be given priority in the ordinary way.3. Secondly, I propose not to take up the whole of an increase madelast year in provision for locally-determined capital expenditure under the heading Miscellaneous Local Services0    Expenditure under this headingembraces a wide range of projects concerned with improving the social and physical environment and with sport and recreation.    It also includes the new office accommodation needed for the new local authorities.    It will rest with individual authorities how precisely the cuts will fall from area1CP(73) 45 COPY NO        6630 March 1973CABINET
to area.    Once again I do not consider that any immediate public announcement will be necessary,    I would expect in this way to findabout  140 million, which represents about 5 per cent of the total provisionfor capital expenditure on Miscellaneous Local Services over the period.This will save a further  50 million a year by 1977-78.4. I have not yet decided how the remaining cost is to be met.Possibilities include:i. Further reductions in road expenditures particularly on maintenance,ii. A wider-ranging cut in miscellaneous local services.iii. An attack on growth of current expenditures by localauthorities.There may also be other possibilities.5. None of these cuts are of course welcome.    But I have decidedthat in present circumstances housing must take priority.6.        I have consulted the Secretaries of State for Scotland and for Wales.The Secretary of State for Wales considers that he will find it difficult, ifnot impossible, to find matching savings from allocations under his control,,Scottish estimates of expenditure arising from the projected White papers on Land and House Prices follow a similar pattern to that for England andWales.    The Secretary of State for Scotland recognises that a proportionof savings must be looked for in Scotland, to offset this expenditure.    Hewill look for proposals with this objective, and will review priorities in programmes within his responsibility, taking into account also the general review of forecast expenditure which is currently in hand.G r department of the Environment30 March 19732
