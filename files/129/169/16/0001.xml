FOREWORDBy the Home Secretary end the Secretary of Statefor scotland the increasing use of firearms In the pursuit of crime is a matterof concern to the whole community.    In recent years; there has been arise in the number of crimes involving the use of firearms and In thenumber of crimes in which shot guns and air weapons were used.    the safety of the citizen is a prime concern of Government^ and a more stringent and efficient control of firearms is necessary to preventmore of them falling Into the hands of criminals.On coming into office the Government therefore put in hand a thorough review of the law on the control of firearms.    Effective legalcontrols are an essential part of soc5oty&apos;s protection against th^criminal use of such weapons.    This branch of the law had not beencomprehensively reviewed since before the war and there are now a numberof important respects In which it needs to be tightened up and made more effective to meet modern conditions.The use of firearms in crime concerns the whole community and measv.to combat it deserve wide public debate beforo final decisions are takor.on changes In the law.This Green Paper sets out for comment the provisional conclusions which the Government have reachedy after a long and comprehensive reviewof the changes which should be made In firearms law.    It includesproposals which will substantially tighten control.In order to make this control effective a considerable minority of law-abiding people must be asked to put up with some Increasedinconvenience, but wo aro satisfied that the present law must betightened up If tho interests of the majority aro to be protected.    It 5because wo wish to strike tho right balance between the interests of thomajority and the claims of those who aro entitled to use firearms forsporting and other purposes that wo wish to have tho views of evoryonowho is interested in this subject before proposals for changes in thelaw are placed before Parliament.
confidential the CONTROL OF FIREARMS IN GREAT BPJTAINPART I.   THE PRESENT POSITIONSECTION 1.    introductory.     This Green Paper is based on the report of a working party on the control of.firearms in Great Britain which was set up at the end of 1970 -aid. finished its work towards &quot;Sic end of last year.   Its terns of reference were:&quot;To consider whether, in the interests of public safety and themaintenance of law and order, any amendments should be made in the lawor practice relating to the manufacture, sale, possession and use ofthe. various types of firearms and similar weapons and their ammunition.&quot;*2.    There were two main reasons for setting up the Working Party.   The first wasthe growth in the use of firearms in crime.   This is a cause of continuing concern,and provides the background against which the Working Party examined the questionwhether further measures of control should be recommended.   Second, the criminal Justice Act 1967 introduced for the first time limited controls over the possession of shot guns by individuals, less stringent than the controls overv/weapons such as rifles and pistols, and it was desirable to examine the operation and the effectiveness of these new controls.3.    The Chairman of the Working Party was Sir John McKay, then HM Chief inspector of Constabulary for England and Wales, and its members were representatives ofpolice fcrocs and officers of the Home Office and Scottish Home and HealthDepartment.   The Working Party obtained a great deal of statistical and other information about the operation of the present firearms controls and the use of firearmsin crime, and conducted a thorough review of all aspects of existing law and practioe.Tho Government ov:e a large debt of gratitude to the forking Party f g** theirvaluable work, and are glad of this opportunity to record their appreciation,*t.     The Working Party&apos;s review was conducted by persons with expert knowledge and experience derived from their involvement in the operation of the presentfirearms controls.   They held discussions with representatives of shooting,farming and entertainment interests and the gun trade, and *:ook account of representations from a number of organisations and individuals including theMagistrates1 Association and bodies concerned with the protection of birds andanimals.   The increase in the use of firearms in crire is a matter of concern tous all, and this consultative document has been drawn up as a basis for widerscrutiny and debate.   It incorporates all the essential information and statisticscollected by the Working Party, together with more detailed statistics for 1971which are now available.   It then sets out the provisional conclusions which theGovernment have reached in the light of the Working Party&apos;s review.-1-
5.     This Paper is in two parts.   Part I describes the present law, summariesthe relevant facts and figures and gives the general reasons for the view thatsome tightening of existing controls is called for.   More detailed statistics arein the Appendix.   Part II then discusses the different aspects of the presentcontrols in turn, and sets out under each heading tho provisional proposals for changes on which the Government would welcome comments.-2-
SECTION 2.    THE EXISTING FIREARMS CONTROLSHistory6.     The foundation of the present system for the control of firearms inGreat Britain v/as laid by the Firearms Act 1920.   Before then there was virtually no control over the sale and possession of firearms, and no legislation toprevent their acquisition for criminal purposes.   The 1920 Act made it an offence to buy, possess, use or carry rifles and pistols, or their ammunition, without acertificate from a chief officer of police, who was required to satisfy himself that an applicant had a good reason for acquiring the firearm and could bopermitted to have it without1 danger to public safety or the peace.   The Act alsorestricted dealing in firearms or ammunition to registered dealers.   Subsequentlegislation has consisted of refinements and extensions of this basic scheme, andthe creation of a number of offences relating to the use of firearms by individuals.7.     A Departmental Committee set up in 1934* found that the 1920 Act had reduced the likelihood both of criminals obtaining possession of the more dangerousfirearms and of injury caused through the misuse of firearms by the irresponsibleor the young.   The Committee&apos;s recommendations were largely incorporated in theFirearms Amendment Act 1936, v/hich strengthened the arrangements for the issue offirearm certificates (in particular, the power to attach conditions to them);brought certain weapons (such as short-barrelled shot guns) within the control;prescribed specially stringent restrictions on continuous-fire weapons (such asmachine-guns); and sought to ensure that unscrupulous or incompetent dealers couldnot be responsible for gaps in the control.8.     The next changes carao in the 1960&apos;s, in consequence of increasing concernover the use of firearms in the commission of crime, and the growing incidence ofhooliganism involving the use of air guns and shot guns.   The Air Guns and shot Guns Etc. Act 1962 dealt with the latter problem by placing restrictions onthe use and possession of air guns and shot guns by young persons, while stillallowing them to be trained in the use of these weapons.   The Firearms Act 1965was concerned with both problems.   It substantially increased the penalties for offences involving firearms, created new offences in connection with carryingfirearms in public places or while trespassing, and made additional provisions toenable the police to ensure that dealers&apos; premises were secure.   Part V of thoCriminal Justice Act 1967 made it an offence to buy or possess a shot gun without_,_z3z____* Report of the Departmental Committees on the Statutory Definition andClassification of Firearms and Ammunition.   Cmd. *f7f?8December 193^
a shot gun certificate issued by a chief officer of police.   The requirements for obtaining a shot gun certificate are less stringent than those applying to firearmcertificates for weapons such as rifles and  pistole;,- &quot;nd the system of control is less comprehensive.Main features of the present lav;9. The existing legislation has all been consolidated in the Firsarms Act 1968.This Act contains a series of graded controls over the acquisition and possessionof firearms.   There are four main categories of weapon.(a) Prohibited weapons, eg. machine guns, sub-machine guns, and weapons and ammunition designed for the discliarge of noxious gases or liquids.   Aspecial authority from the Secretary of State is required for the manufacturers, sale, acquisition or possession of such weapons orammunition.(b) Plfles, pistols, most of their ammunition, short-barrelled shot guns(i.e. those having a barrel less than 2*t inches in length) and speciallydangerous air&apos; weapons.   A firearm certificate issued by the chief officer ofpolice is required for the acquisition or possession of individual weapons.The chief officer must be satisfied that an applicant for a certificate hasa good reason for having the weapon and is fit to be entrusted with it, andthat the public safety or the peace will not be endangered.   Conditions maybe attached to the certificate, and one of the standard conditions on allcertificates requires weapons and ammunition to be kept in a secure placeexcept when in actual use.   There is a right of appeal to the Crown Court inEngland and Wales against the refusal of a certificate.   In Scotland the appeal lies to the Sheriff Court.    (All subsequent references to theCrown Court in this Paper should be understood as referring to the SheriffCourt in Scotland.)(c) Shot guns.   Since 1968 a shot gun certificate has been required for theacquisition or possession of long-barrelled shot guns.   Except in the case ofpersons who are prohibited from possessing firearms of any kind, such acertificate may be refused by the chief officer of police only if he considers the public safety or the peace would be endangered if he granted it.   Thereis a right of appeal to the Crown Court against a refusal.   A shot guncertificate authorises the possession of an unlimited number of shot guns,there is no condition requiring safe keeping, and shot gun ammunition is notcontrolled.-4-
(d)   Air weapons, except those classified as specially dangerous, are not subject to certificate control, although there are some general restrictionson their possession and use by young people under 17.10.   The Firearms Act 1968 specifically prohibits the possession of firearms bya person who has served a prison sentence, for life if the sentence was threeyears or more, for five years if it was three months but less than three years;and application may be made to the Crown Court to have this prohibition set aside.The Act also providos for a number of special exemptions from the certificaterequirement.   The more important exemptions are that a member of a riflo club orcadet corps approved by the Secretary of State may possess a firearm, without acertificate, when engaged in-target practice or drill as a member; and a personrunning a miniature rifle range or gallery with .22 rifles may acquire and possesssuch rifles, without a certificate, and any person may use such a rifle at&apos;the rangeor gallery.11.   The 1968 Act provides that a person who deals in firearms or ammunition byway of trade or business must be registered with the police as a firearms dealerand must keep detailed records of his transactions.   In general, registration canbe refused by the chief officer of police only if he is satisfied that theapplicant cannot be permitted to carry on business as a dealer without danger tothe public safety or to the peace.   There is a right of appeal to the Grown Courtagainst a refusal of registration.12.   The 1968 Act also lays down heavy maximum penalties for certain criminaluses of firearms, and these penalties have recently been increased by the criminal Justice Act 1972.   The offences of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life, or using a firearm to resist arrest, carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.   The offences of carrying a firearm with intent to commit anindictable offence, or while committing certain specified offences, carry amaximum penalty of Ik years1 imprisonment.5
SECTION 3.   FIREARMS IN CRIMEThe Statistics13.   Comprehensive statistics of offences involving firearms have boon collectedonly since 19^7. when the Home Office introduced new arrangements for this purpose.Figures for the total number of indictable offences in England and Walesinvolving firearms have been collected for each year since 196l, but detailed figures were not collected before I967.   The figures for earlier years includedthefts of firearms as well as offences in which firearms wore used.   The appendix to this paper analyses the relevant information since 19o7i bringing up to date and extending an analysis of the years 1967 ^nd I968 which was published in 1970*.(The statistics of offences in this paper and the appendix relate to England andWales only.   Only limited information is available for Scotland.   It is hoped tohave fuller information iu future.)   The following paragraphs summarise the moreimportant information in the statistical Appendix.ih.   The figures include not only those offences in which a firearm was involved by being used,that is, fired, used to threaten or used as a blunt instrument orcarried for possible use, but also offences in which a firearm was stolon,handled or obtained by fraud or forgery.   The number of offences in which afirearm was used rose from 792 in 1967 to 1,735 in 19715 and formed about one-third of all offences involving firearms in each year during this period.Firearms were known to have been carried for possible use, but not used, in about100 or so of the offences involving firearms in each year.   Table A gives themain details of the offences recorded as known to the police in 1967-71.-6-*  Home Office Research Studios No. k.   Firearms in Crime by A.D. Weatherhoadand B.M.

In about half the offences involving the use of firearms physical injury was caused.   The number of such offences rose from V36 in 196? to 910 in 1971t butthe number of fatal injuries remained fairly steady varying within the range of25-50 in the same period.   Air weapons were responsible for no fatal injuries butaccounted for most of the slight and serious injuries.   More than half the fatalinjuries were caused by shot guns.17.   Table 12 in the Appendix gives details of the number of robberies in whichfirearms were used in the years I967 to 1971.   Tho number of such robberies rose from 265 in I967 to 572 in 1971.   This is an increase of 116%, but, as can beseen from the table, the ratio of firearm robberies to all robberies remainedfairly constant.-8-15. Offences in which firearms were used are analysed by the type of weapon inTable B.The largest increase in the five years was in offencesinvolving air weapons.   There was also a steady growth inthe number of offences in which a long-barrelled shot gunwas used, and a rapid growth in the use of sawn off shotguns, mainly in robberies (from 17 in 1967 to 88 in 1971).TABLE BType of weapon involved in offencesin which firearms wore used 1967-1971
CONFIDENTIAL18.   In 19711 tho latest year for which detailed figures are available, the numberof indictable offences recorded as known to the police increased by 5.8% over1970.   The increase in the number of indictable offences involving firearms was17.2$ and, in the number of offences in which a firearm was actually used, theincrease was 27-7/0-   The use of most types of firearms increased, the largestincreases being in the use of long-barrelled shot guns and air weapons.   The^provisional figure of offences in which a firearm was used in 1972 shows anincrease of 19.;&quot;$ over 1971.The sources of firearms used in crime19-   In many cases it is not possible to discover the original source of a firearmused in crime, for instance so as to check whether it had ever been legitimatelyhold.   A criminal found with a weapon on him is frequently unwilling to reveal,or does not know, its origin.   A stolen weapon registered on a certificate in one area may come to light in another, perhaps years later.   But Sir .John McKay&apos;sWorking Party obtained details of 120 cases in Great Britain, most of which occurred in the last two or three years, in which legitimately held firearms of a kind for which a firearm certificate is required under section 1 of the FirearmsAct   1968 (mainly pistols and rifles) or shot guns hid been stolen or borrowedand subsequently used for criminal purposes.   The Working Party found that in manyof these cases it was the availability of the particular firearm used that led toits use.20.   Shirty three of these cases related to firearms such as rifles and pistolsto which section 1 of the Firearms Act 1968 applies and for which a firearmcertificate is required (&quot;section 1&quot; firearms).   These 33 cases included thenotorious cases in which a firearm stolen from the armoury of a school rifle clubwas used to murder a police officer; in which a rifle was taken from a localfairground and used to murder    3     tourists; and in which a pistol obtainedwithout authority from a rifle club was used in a robbery and to murder 2police officers in Glasgow.   In   4    oases section 1 firearms were stolen fromdealers and then used in robbery and similar crimes.   In 10 cases section 1firearms used in such crimes had been stolen from private individuals who heldcertificates.   There were     3     further cases in which the firearm used in thecrime had been stolen from a rifle club.   In    7    cases the firearm had beentaken from a relative, and in   6   cases the weapon had been &quot;borrowed&quot; from acertificate holder.21.   Of the 120 cases mentioned above, 87 involved shot guns.   In 25 of these87 cases the shot gun had been taken without permission from a certificateholder who was a friend, relative or acquaintance and in 20 of the 25 the shotgun was then used in a domestic quarrel, or to shoot someone against whom a-9-
grudge was held; in the remaining   $    -ases it was used in other types of crime.In 28 cases the holder of a shot gun certificate gave or lent a shot gun to, orbought a shot gun for, a person without a certificate.   In 10 cases a shot gun wasstolen from a dealer and then used in robbery.   In 24 casea a shot gun ttnsstolen from a certificate holder (either from a car or by housebreaking) and theneither sawn off in preparation for use, or actually used, in robbery or similari-crime.22.   In the period 1969 to 1971 there were over 2,700 offences in which shot gunsor section 1 firearms were stolen (Appendix table 20).   It is reasonable to suppose that in a substantial proportion of these the owner h&amp;ld the firearmlegitimately and, as seen in!paragraphs 15 and 16, some, at least, of these were subsequently used in the commission of crime.   It is against this background thattho efficacy of the existing firearms controls and the need for changes have tobe considered.-10-
SECTION        THE CASE FOR STRICTER CONTROL23.   The extent to which the rising trend in the use of firearms in crime can be checked or even reversed by stricter controls must be seon in proportion.   Nosystem of legal controls, however stringent, is likely to be wholly successful in preventing criminals from obtaining firearms; there will always be some who are, bent on acquiring them and have the resourcefulness or the connexions to do so.Society should make this as difficult for criminals as reasonably possible.Legal controls are aimed at cutting down, so far as practicable, the readyavailability of the more dangerous firearms to the criminal, and to thoirresponsible.   This is a useful aim, which is not invalidated by the difficultyof achieving more.24.   It may be suggested that the existing controls have failed because, despitebeing strengthened in a number of respects in recent years, they have not preventeda steady rise in the use of firearms in crime.   But the question we must askourselves is what the situation would have been with no controls, or weakercontrols.   If dangerous firearms and their ammunition had been easier to obtainwithin the lav/, if the requirements on legal holders to keep their firearms insafe custody had been less strict, is it plausible to suggest that the extent of criminal and irresponsible uses of firearms would actually have been less?25.   It can also be argued that the legal controls are not necessary in relationto responsible persons who have legitimate uses for firearms, and that the objectof the law should be to deter and to punish unlawful uses.   There are, however,serious weaknesses in sole reliance on this approach.   Without some machinery,such as the present law provides, for distinguishing the responsible from theirresponsible person, and the legitimate from the illegitimate use, the law wouldhave to allow everyone to buy dangerous firearms - even, for instance, knowncriminals and the mentally ill - without inquiry into their reasons for wantingsuch weapons.   Experience demonstrates that some people are not in practicedeterred by the prospect of heavy penalties, and these include some of the most dangerous and determined criminals.   Two kinds of measure are required for theprevention of crime - measures to reduce the opportunities open to the criminal,as well as those which provide for his punishment.   One essential aim of anyserious attempt to contain the growth of violent crime should therefore be to eliminate avoidable opportunities to acquire firearms for criminal purposes.26.   It should be emphasised at this point that neither the present controls,nor the changes proposed in this Paper, represent a threat to established legaluses of firearms.   At the end of 1971 over 190,000 firearm certificates were inforce in England and Wales, and over 38,000 in Scotland.   The numbers of shot gun-11-
certificates in force were over 715,COO in England and Wales and over 77,000 inScotland.   During the year 1971 there were in England and Wales 304 offences knownto the police in which a rifle or pistol was used, and 334 offences in which along-barrelled or sawn-off shot gun was used.   These figures illustrate how fewfirearms are used for criminal purposes by comparison with the total number of firearms held lawfully.   The Government have no wish to restrict such well-established activities as shooting game and vermin, and target and clay pigeonshooting, by persons who use firearms for purposes of these kinds in a responsiblemanner.   It is inevitable that firearms controls should cause some inconvenience tosuch persons.   The degree of inconvenience is not large when compared with the risk to the community of failing tp exercise adequate control.27.   The changes proposed in this paper would also place additional burdens on thepolice.   Here again the extent of the extra work has to be balanced against the dangers, particularly to the police themselves, of failing to put further obstacles in the way of criminals willing to use firearms.   Although police officers may be armed when it is known in advance that they have to face a dangerous armed person,and when on certain protection duties, these circumstances are exceptional.   TheGovernment are in no doubt that the policy of an unarmed police service is right,and is supported by the great majority of the public and of the police.   If thepolice regularly carried firearms and were prepared to use them, the ordinarycriminal would be more likely to arm himself.   There might be a still further increase in armed crime, and more shooting of police officers and innocent, citizens.The policy of an unarmed police service, and the dangers which might be involved inany departure from it, emphasise the importance of ensuring that our fire-armscontrols are as effective as we can reasonably make them.28.   The review by the Working Party has indicated that the present controls arenot in all respects as effective as they could be.   The extent of crime involvingfirearms Ijs growing.   There is evidence that, in a significant number of cases,firearms are used criminally or irresponsibly because they happen to be availablerather than because those concerned were determined to obtain them by hook or bycrook.   In its present form the law in some circumstances allows unsuitablepersons to possess firearms, or persons to possess firearms without having a legitimate use for them, or to possess more firearms than required for such uses,or to take inadequate precautions against theft or misuse.   The main objective of firearms controls should be to ensure, so far as practicable, that the possessionof lethal weapons, which can be and are used criminally and irresponsibly to thedanger of the community, is restricted to suitable persons who have legitimate use for them and who will keep them safely.   The present law has certain inadequacieswhich prevent it from giving full and consistent effect to this objective.   Theproposals in Part II of this paj^r are designed to remedy these inadequacies.
PART II.   PROVISIONAL PROPOSALS FOP. changes the second pr.rt of this paper takes in turn various aspects of the lav/ on thecontrol of firearms, and discusses under each heading ways in which itseffectiveness might be increased.   Sections 5-9 discuss the different kinds offirearm, and matters relating to certificates for them.   Section 10 relates toammunition, section 11 to dealing in firearms and section 12 to rifle clubs,cadet corps and shooting galleries.   Section 13 is concerned with the possessionof firearms by young persons, section lk with imitation firearms, section 15 withpenalties and section 16 with the holding of a firearms amnesty.   Each of theprovisional proposals on which the Government would welcome comments is given in heavy type.-13-
SECTION 5-   PROHIBITED WEAPONS30.   The most stringent controls in the Firearms Act 1968 apply to machine guns and weapons capable of discharging gas or any other noxious substance.   Thoseparticularly dangerous weapons are known as &quot;prohibited weapons&quot;.   Section 5 ofthe 1968 Act makes it an offence to possess, purchase, acquire, manufacture, sellor transfer such a weapon without the authority of the Hone Secretary, or inScotland, the Secretary of State for Scotland.Existing policy31.   These controls are already as strict as they could be. short of a total prohibition of weapons of those kinds.   The Secretaries of State have anunfettered power to refuse to grant an authority, and there is no appeal againsta refusal.   This is generally accepted as right, since there are almost nolegitimate reasons for the private possession or use of such weapons.   TheGovernment take the view that it is not in the interests of public security that private collections of these particularly dangerous weapons should be maintained.There has been a small number of collections of machine guns, but recently thepolicy has been to decline to grant or renew authorities allowing the possessionby a private individual of weapons capable of automatic fire.   The onlyauthorities for such weapons likely to be granted or renewed in the future arethose given to a small number of publicly-owned museums which maintaincollections of historical interest in conditions of strict security; to a fewlarge-scale dealers engaged in international trade; to manufacturers who make these weapons or military equipment to which they are fitted; and to a very small number of dealers who hire out such weapons for film and television performances.In all these cases an authority is granted or renewed only after inquiries havebeen made by the police.   Each authority is subject to stringent conditionslimiting the circumstances in which the weapons may be possessed, and specifyingthe degree of security required to safeguard them.   A firearm certificate is also required from the chief officer of police (see section 6 for the law on firearmcertificates).32.   Broadly the same applies to weapons discharging a noxious substance or gas.There has never been any justification for such weapons to be in private hands,and the only authorities likely to be granted or renewed in future are those given to the snail number of firms engaged in the manufacture and supply of CSweapons for the Armed Forces and the police.    &quot;Hypo-darts&quot; and similar equipmentdesigned to discharge a drug into an animal are probably &quot;prohikutc-d weapons&quot;,since the drug may in law be a &quot;noxious substance&quot;.   Accordingly authorities are-lk-
also granted to persons such as zoo keepers and veterinary surgeons who need touse such weapons in the course of their work.The extension of the prohibited category33.   Self loading rifles do not cone within the definition of a prohibited weapon,but some of them can without difficulty be converted to automatic fire.   Thoseare mainly weapons originally designed to be capable of automatic fire, which havebeen modified either at the time of manufacture or subsequently so that they firea single shot at each pull of the trigger.   There are reasons for distinguishingthese self loading rifles from ordinary rifles.   They are inherently more dangerousin tho wrong hands, and in many cases it is a relatively simple operation to convertthem back to continuous fire operation, making them prohibited weapons.   Pumpaction and repeater shot guns differ similarly from ordinary shot guns.   They erecapable of firing a number of cartridges in quick succession without reloading,and they too are much more dangerous than other shot guns when in the wrong hands,though not capable of conversion to automatic fire.   Although self-loading riflesare used in a specialised but internationally recognised form of target shooting,and by some people with a physical disability which makes it difficult to operate the bolt of an ordinary rifle, it can bo argued that weepons of these kinds oughtto be controlled more stringently than ordinary rifles, pistols and shot guns.Jh.   The pace of technological chango today is such that legal definitions inthis field which have proved staisfactory in the past may at any moment be rendered inadequate by new developments.   Capacity for the continuous fire ofmissiles may no longer be a sufficient test to decide which weapons of this kindare so dangerous that they ought to fall into the prohibited category.   Thedischarge of a noxious gas, liquid or other thing may not indefinitely prove wide enough to embrace all the weapons and ammunition of these kinds which ought tobe prohibited.   A procedure is required to enable specially dangerous new developments in firearms and ammunition to be brought within the prohibitedcategory without the delay which is often unavoidable when an amendment to a statute is required.35.   In the light of the considerations set out in the two previous paragraphs the Government would welcome viev/s on the desirability of making the two following changes:(a) self loading rifles, and pump action and repeater shot guns,should be declared prohibited weapons;(b) there should be power to make a statutory instrument declaring&apos; new kinds of specially dangerous weapons and ammunition to be prohibited.
SECTION 6.   RIFLES AND PISTOLS36.   With, certain specified exceptions it is an offence to possess, purchase oracquire a firearm of one of the kinds subject to section 1 of the Firearms Act 19-68without first obtaining a firearm certificate from the chief officer of police.This section covers all firearms, except shot guns ijftth hnrroas^-aot less&apos; thxuv24.inches long and air weapons; such weapons are referred to in this Paper as&quot;section 1 firearms&quot;.   Section 27 of the Act precludes the grant of a certificateto any person whom the chief officer has reason to believe is:(a) prohibited by the Act from possessing a firearm (e.g. by virtue of having served a sentence, of imprisrnment); or(b) of intemperate habits or unsound mind; or(c) for any reason unfitted to be entrusted with a firearm.Before granting a certificate the chief officer must satisfy himself that theapplicant:(a) has a good reason for possessing the firearm in respect of which theapplication is made; and(b) can be permitted to have the firearm without danger to public safetyor to the peace.There is an appeal to the Crown Court against a refusal by the chief officer togrant a certificate.37*   The object of these controls, as explained in section 4, is to confine thelegal possession and use of lethal weapons to responsible persons who have a legitimate use for them.   This section examines how far the existing law is apt to achieve this object.What should count as a &quot;good reason&quot;38.   The legal provisions summarised in paragraph 36 leave the chief officer ofpolice to decide what constitutes a &quot;good reason&quot; for possessing a section 1firearm, subject to the right of appeal to the Crown Court.   The Firearms Act1968, following earlier firearms legislation,makes no attempt to define what should, or should not, be regarded as a good reason for possessing a lethalfirearm.   The stringency of the legal control over section 1 firearms thereforerests xn practice upon the way in which chief officers exercise the wide powerof decision vested in them by the lav;, and on the decisions of the Crown Courtin the relatively infrequent cases taken to appeal.
59.   The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland issue advice tochief officers of police, normally after consultation with, then, on a wide variety of matters, including the application and operation of the Firearms Act 1968.   Animportant piece of advice given by the Secretaries of State is that personalprotection should not be regarded as a good reason for a private person to possessa section 1 firearm.   This is a policy which has long been followed by chief officers.   Nevertheless advice of this kind has no legal force; a chief officer isnot bound to follow it, and the Crown Court is not bound to take notice of it.40.   This scheme of control derives from the Firearms Act 1920.   It was reviewed by the Departmental Committee which reported in 1934, and by Sir John McKay1sV/orking Party, without any radical change being suggested in it.   The 1934 Reportrecommended that the right of appeal against the refusal of a firearm certificateshould be transferred from the magistrates to quarter sessions (now the CrownCourt) in the interest of greater consistency of decision on appeal.   Apart fromthis one change, the basic system has survived unaltered for over fifty years.This has probably been because there has been no general disagreement over the way in which the powers of chief officers and the Crown Court have, as a matter of practice, been exercised.   To put the matter very broadly, sporting purposes andtarget shooting have been accepted as good reasons for possessing section 1firearms, and personal protection has not.4l.   Any tightening up of the present section 1 controls or widening of their scope and - in particular - any generally stricter policy adopted by chief officers in deciding whether to grant firearm certificates would be likely toplace some strain on the present system.   Two of the proposals put forward inthis Paper for public discussion are of this nature: one is the proposal to bringlong-barrelled shot guns within the scope of section 1; the other is the proposal that a desire by a private individual to start a collection of section 1 firearmsshould no longer be regarded as a good reason for granting a certificate, as ithas hitherto been regarded in some cases.42.   There is also a more general reason for raising the question whether decisions on the grant or refusal of firearm certificates should remain a matter for theindividual decision of chief officers and courts.   The policy which they follow isa matter of considerable importance to the general public, and to all those whopossess or may wish to possess section 1 firearms.   This policy is nowhere setout in any statute or other legal instrument.   It does not have to be discussed in Parliament.   There is no guarantee that a consistent and acceptable policy will continue to be followed throughout the country.-17-
h3.   Two examples may serve to illustrate the point.   The time might cone when a chief officer or the Crown Court decided to allow a section 1 firearm for personalprotection.   However exceptional the circumstances, this decision might be treatedas a precedent, leading to the gradual proliferation of guns in private hands solely for the purported protection of private persons and their property.   The Governmentwould view any such development with grave concern, but coulil not bo sure, as thelaw stands, of preventing or controlling it.   Or some chief officers, concerned atthe growth in the use of firearms in crime and wishing to cut down the number of firearms in private hands, might cease to treat some well-established reason fortheir possession, such as target shooting, as a good reason for possessinga   pistol,,   and appeals against the application of this policy might succeed insome cases but not in others.   It is arguable that the burden of deciding such issues of public policy should rest on the responsible Minister, subject tc thecontrol of Parliament, and should be published in a legal instrument which thoseadministering the law would then follow consistently and v/ithout question.hk.   To set out in a statute the reasons which should and should not be counted asgood reasons for granting a firearm certificate would be a difficult task.   Theresult might prove both incomplete and unduly rigid.   Tho Government would therefore welcome comments on the proposal that the Secretaries of State should beempowered to make a statutory instrument setting out reasons which should, andshould not, count as good reasons for the purposes of section 1 of the FirearmsAct 1968.   The power of a chief officer to grant or refuse a certificate on other grounds would not be impaired but the instrument would provide an authoritativestatement of the main lines of policy to be applied by chief officers and courts in deciding individual cases.   To give some examples, the possession of a rifleor pistol for target shooting as a member of a shooting club, and the possessionaf a rifle for sporting purposes or the destruction of vermin, on land suitablefor such a purpose, would count as good reasons.   Possession of a firearm by aprivate individual fer the protection of person or property would not be a good reason: firearms cannot be regarded as a suitable means of protection in thiscountry, and may be a source of danger.   If the proposal in paragraph k? was accepted, the starting of a private collection of section 1 weapons would not bea good reason.Collectors45.   There are some private collections of firearms kept mainly because of an interest in firearms and not for use.   If a desire to collect..firearms is accepted as a good reason to justify the grant of a certificate, then virtuallyany person who wanted to keep a few weapons could make out a case for having a
certificate.   Any firearm, and particularly a collection of modern firearms, maybe a target for criminals.   This fact must raise the question whether anaccumulation of weapons for their own sake, by a private person with no legitimateuse for them, is any longer acceptable in the circumstances of today.   Although the&quot;de-activation&quot; of weapons in a collection is a useful safeguard it does noteliminate all risk, because a de-activated firearm can usually be put back intoworking order.   Irreversible de-activation normally means a degree of mutilationthat would not be acceptable in a collection.46.   It lias been suggested that there should bo a special form of certificate forcollectors, which would place a collector in some respects on the same footing as adealer, by allowing the possession of a number of firearms up to a certain limit.This suggestion, however, assumes an affirmative answer to the question whether the wish to possess one or more weapons of lethal character, without having any good reason to use them, should continue to be accepted.   In practice, chief officers ofpolice are normally reluctant to allow collections of modern weapons to be maintainedbut there are a number of existing collections, and it would obviously be unreasonable to expect these collectors to dispose of their weapons at the expiry of their current firearm certificates.   It would likewise bo impracticable torequire all firearms currently in the hands of collectors to be effectivelydo-activated.47.   A difficult balance is involved here between the freedom of the individual andthe safety of us all.   The Government believe that considerations of security shouldbe paramount, and accordingly propose that no new firearm certificate should begranted to enable a collection to be started by a person who does not already holdone, or to enable an existing collector to extend his collection.48.   The same principles apply to trophies of war and weapons held as souvenirs.Weapons issued to or captured by members of the armed forces during the 1939^19^5war and subsequently are Government property, and their retention is not permitted.There may be some people, for example former members of colonial police forces, whohave been allowed to retain pistols or revolvers since 19^5.   The Government proposethat persons who now possess weapons as trophies or souvenirs should be allowed toretain them, subject to obtaining renewal of their certificates, but a desire to possess a firearm as a souvenir or for sentimental reasons should no longer beregarded as a good reason justifying the grant of a new certificate.Minor improvements49.   One of the first objects of the controls is to keep firearms out of the handsof those who cannot be trusted to use them responsibly.   Chief officers of police are particularly careful in scrutinizing applications for firearm certificates-19-
from persons who have committed offences.   The relevant question in the applicationform does not at presentrequire a person who has been made subject to a probationorder or an order of conditional discharge to declare this fact.   The G-ovornmcntpropose that the form of application proscribed by the Firearms Rules 1969(SI 1969 No. 1219) and the Firearms (Scotland) Rules 1969 (SI 1969 No. 1453(S116)should bo amended to introduce a requirement to reveal offences which resulted inprobation or a conditional discharge, as well as offences resulting; in penalties.The suggestion has been made that a convicted person who is not reconvicted within a specified period should bo given a &quot;clean slate&quot;.   In the Government1s vie: thoconsiderations underlying this suggestion do not apply to the possession of a lethalweapon, tmd a chief officer should have tho full facto about an applicants recordboforo deciding whether to grant a certificate,50.   Under section 21(2) of the Firearms Act 1968 a person who has boon sentenced toBorstal training, or to imprisonment for a term of 3 months or more but less than3 yocrs, 01- who has been sentenced to be detained for such a term in a detentioncentre or in a young offenders&apos; institution in Scotland, is prohibited for a periodof 5 years from the date of his release from having a firearm or ammunition in hisposossion.   This provision has bean hold not to apply to a suspended sentence,though it appears probable that it was intended to apply.   It is proposed that thelaw should^be amended to ensure that suspended sentences of imprisonment result ina prohibition under the Firearms Act in the same way as sentences which are served.51.   Four prescribed conditions are included in every firearm certificate, and thochief officer of police has power to impose any further conditions he thinksrequired.   Section 29 of the 1968 Act allows the chief officer to very suchconditions, and the holder of a certificate to apply for a variation.   Thoro is anappeal against the refusal of a chief officer to vary a condition, but doubt hasbeen raised whether there is an appeal against the original inclusion of a condition in a certificate.   It is proposed that the lav; should make it clear that there is aright of appeal against the inclusion of a condition in a firearm certificate otherthan a prccribed oondition, as well as against refusal of a certificate.52,   Section 42 of the 1968 Act requires a person transferring a firearm to another person in tho United Kingdom, not being a firearms dealer, to notify theappropriate chiof officer of police.   It is proposed that a notification should alsobo flivon to tho chief officor of police when a firearm is transferred to a dealer,to enable tho police to keep more oomplcte records of transfers by individuals.- 20 -
53.   Whenever a certificate is applied for or renewed, the chief officer of policehas an opportunity to consider whether the holder has, or still has, a good reason justifying the grant of a certificate.   The law does not, however, providefor a situation in which a certificate holder&apos;s good reason ceases to exist duringthe three year currency of his firearm certificate.   It is proposed that tho chief officer should have power to revoke the certificate of a person who no longerhas a good reason to possess a firearm, subject to a right to appeal to theCrown Court against the revocation. *
SECTION 7.   SHOT GUNSThe present law5u.   Before 1 May 1968, when Part V of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 came intoeffect, there was no control over the acquisition of shot guns.   The provisions ofRart V of the 1967 Act have since been consolidated in the Firearms Act 1968.   they provide a form of control considerably less stringent than that over  Section 1firearms.   They require a shot gun certificate for the possession of a shot gun, and make it an offence to sell or transfer a shot gun, except to the holder of a shotgun certificate or a registered firearms dealer, but the test for the grant of ashot gun certificate is far less rigorous than that for a certificate under section 1.Section 28 of the 1968 Act provides that a shot gun certificate must be granted orrenewed by the chief officer of police unless he has reason to believe that theapplicant(a) is prohibited from possessing a shot gun (e.g. by reason of a criminalrecord); or(b) cannot be permitted to possess a shot gun without danger to the public safety or to the peace.There is an appeal to the Crown Court against a refusal.   Eaoh shot gun certificateis subject to certain prescribed conditions, which are at present that the holdermu^t sign the certificate in ink, and must inform the chief officer of the loss ortheft of any shot gun in his possession.   There are no other prescribed conations,and chief officers have no power to add further conditions, e.g. relating to safekeeping.55.   These controls are different in kind from those over section 1 weapons.   Thereis no need for an applicant to show that he has a good reason for possessing a shotgun.   A certificate covers any number of shot guns.   There are no provisions toensure security.   Records of transfers of individual weapons are not required.   by contrast, the controls over section 1 weapons are intended to restrict the legalpossession of such firearms to suitable persons; to ensure that such persons havegood reasons justifying the holding of each individual firearm; to provide for thesafe keeping of the firearms; to lay down any appropriate conditions governing thecircumstances in which they may be carried or used; and to secure that transfers of individual weapons are recorded in the certificates or other records of those concerned in the transactions.-22-
56.   These differences between the treatment of section 1 firearms and shot gunsderive from the fact that the regular use of shot guns in crime is a relativelyrecent development.   A Committee on the Control of Firearms, whose recommendationsformed the basis of the Firearms Act 1920, reported in 1918 that the cases wererare in which shot guns were used for criminal or illegal purposes in Great Britain.The Departmental Committee which reported in 193k found that, while shot guns were responsible for many accidents and suicides, they were not a favoured weaponof criminals of the bandit and burglar type.   Shot guns are very widely used,especially in rural areas, for legitimate purposes; and hitherto the   view hasalways been taken that a strict control of the   kind applied to section 1 firearmscould not be justified, considering the work that would be required to administerit.   Thus the present controls, established in 1968, are not designed to place any great difficulty in the way of acquiring shot guns.   They prevent certainex-criminals from doing so legally.   But a chief officer can otherwise refuse acertificate only if lie has concrete evidence, of a kind that could be given i.: theCrown Court in the event of an appeal, that the grant of a certificate would cause&quot;danger to the public safety or the peace&quot;.   A chief officer cannot refuse a shotgun certificate simply because he considers that the applicant is not fit to boentrusted with a shot gun, or has no good reason for wishing to possess one.Is the present law adequate?57&apos;   In considering the degree of control required over the various kinds of firearms, there are two main factors to take into account.   The first is how lethaleach type of weapon may be.   A shot gun, especially at short range, can be as lethalas a rifle or pistol       If the dangerous nature of a firearm were the solecriterion, then there would be no clear ground for differentiating between shot gunsand section 1 firearms.58.   The second main criterion is the extent to which a particular type of firearmis used for criminal purposes.   The figures in the appendix show,  that longbarrelled shot guns are used about as frequently in crime as rifles and pistols.   Ininterpreting the figures it must be borne in mind that, although a sawn-off shot gunis already a section 1 weapon, there is no difficulty about sawing off the barrels ofa long-barrelled shot gun.59.   In principle, therefore, a case can be made out for treating all shot guns assection 1 firearms.   This would be a major step: the views of interested parties and Ox the general public, and the administrative problems involved in possiblytrebling the number cf section 1 certificates, must also be taken into account.
60.   Sir John McKay1 s Working Party found that there were two sharply opposing viev:3on this issue.   On the one hand, representatives of magistrates, local authorities,farmers, and those concerned -rith the protection of birds, expressed concern at thegrowth in the use of firearms in crime, and at the increasing number of armedtrespassers in the countryside.   They urged stronger controls over shot guns -though not necessarily to the extent of applying the full range of section 1controls.   On the other hand, representatives of shooting interests questioned whether stricter controls would help to contain armed crime, and expressed concern that such controls might be administered with undue severity.   They urged theview that such a change in the law would be unjustified and unacceptable.61.   The majority of chief officers cf police were strongly of the view that thelaw should now require an applicant to have a good reason for possessing a shot gun.Most of those who took this view believed that this step would only be effective if the recording of individual transfers of shot guns was required, which would, ineffect, put shot guns on the same basis as section 1 firearms.   Chief officers were in no doubt that there were cases - some put the proportion as high as 20% -in which they would feel obliged to refuse applications for shot gun certificatesif the applicant were required to give a good reason.   Similarly, a number of chief officers emphasised that under the existing law they felt obliged to issue shot guncertificates to people who were in their view unsuitable to hold them, for instance by reason of their long criminal records.   Most chief officers believed that the extra work involved in applying a strict control of this kind to shot guns would be worth while.Stricter shot gun controls62.   The Government take the view that stricter controls over shot guns are necessary and justified.   Expcrior.ce since 1968 suggests that there is no satisfactory half-way house between no control, and a full control on the lines of that applying to section 1 firearms.      The onus should now be placed on a person wishing to possessa shot gun to show that he has a good reason for doing so, and to keep it inproperly secure conditions.   The Government believe that the effect of this step would be to reduce significantly the number of shot gun certificate holders, thenumber of shot guns in private hands and the prevalence of armed trespass withshot guns.   It should therefore reduce the pool of illegally held shot guns, andcriminals should find it more difficult to obtain shot guns for use in seriouscrime.-2b,-
63.   The Government do not intend that persons of good character, with legitimateopportunities of using a shot gun for sport, should be refused shot guncertificates or made subject to burdensome conditions of use.   The power to prescribe &quot;good reasons&quot;, suggested in paragraph Uk above, could be used to ensureagainst such refusals.   For instance the regulations could cover the positionnot only of those who shoot regularly but also of those with infrequent butlegitimate opportunities to shoot.   The Government&apos;s intention that these controls over 3hot guns should be administered with as little inconvenience to the citizenas is consistent with the requirements of public safety; they believe that theneed to obtain a certificate and renew it every three years, to record transfers of weapons, and to keep shot guns in a safe place, would not place an undue burden on the individual.6k&apos;   The Governments proposal is that shot guns should be subject to the samecontrols as rifles and pistols under the Firearms Act 1968*   The main effects ofthis proposal would be these.   An applicant for a certificate would have to snow thathe had good reason for the possession of each individual gun (or matched pair).Persons unfit to be entrusted with shot guns would be refused certificates.Conditions requiring the safe keeping of shot guns would be included incertificates.   And transfers of individual weapons would have to be recorded.While the enforcement of conditions in certificates might present some difficulty to the police, the introduction of a legal requirement to keep shot guns safelyshould by itself have a substantial effect.   There is a considerable number ofcautions and prosecutions under the present law for firearm certificate offences.- 25 -
SECTION 6.   OTHER PROVISIONS RELATING TO FIREARMS AND CERTIFICATESThe numbering of firearms65*.   The recording of transactions involving firearms, and tho maintenance by thepolice of records of legally held firearms, are important features of the controls.These records provide a check against firearms falling into unauthorised hands, andthey assist the police in the investigation of crimes involving firearms and thetracing of such firearms.   Most section 1 firearms are stamped with individualnumbers but different makers use different numbering systems, and some firearmshave more than one number.   The proportion of shot guns bearing makers&apos; serialnumbers is smaller.   The fact that there is no common numbering system for allfirearms, and that some have no number at all, makes the existing records lessvaluable than they would otherwise be.   This fact would become considerably moreimportant if shot guns were brought within the section 1 controls.   A common and comprehensive numbering system would assist the computerisation of police firaarmsrecords and would be essential if a central record were to be established.66.   The Departmental Committee which reported in 193u considered the possibilityof a common numbering system for newly manufactured or imported weapons, but this possibility was not pursued following publication of their report.   Sir John McKay&apos;sWorking Party re-examined this issue.   They concluded that an effective numberingsystem would have to apply to all firearms, not only those newly manufactured orimported, and that there was much to be said for such a system, for the reasons givenin the previous paragraph.   They recommended that further consideration should begiven to the introduction of a scheme under which each firearm would be stamped ina suitable place with a unique number, made up of a prefix identifying the policearea in which a certificate in respect of the weapon was originally issued, and afurther number identifying the particular weapon.67.     The introduction of such a system would require detailed working out inconsultation with the police, manufacturers and importers, firearms dealers andothers concerned.   There would be an associated need to examine police procedures for the issue and renewal of certificates.   It is proposed that there should beconsultations with those concerned on the possibility of a common numbering system for all section 1 firearms and shot gunsj and that statutory powers should be takento cater for such a scheme by requiring the stamping of unique numbers on all firearms.Overseas visitors68.     Section 14 of the 1968 Act allows a visitor to this country to possess a shotgun for up to 30 days in any one year without a shot gun certificate.   There i3 nosimilar provision for an overseas visitor to possess a section 1 firearm without afirearm certificate.   Seotion 7 of the Act empowers chief officers to issue permits- 26 -
confidential for the possession of firearms and ammunition so as to cover temporary situations,e.g. to enable an executor to dispose of firearms after the death of a certificateholderj the section is on occasion used to permit o\rerseas visitors to possesssection 1 firearms without a certificate., but was not intended for that purpose,69.   There are two main defects in this situation.   The first is that section 11.contains no safeguards to prevent a visitor from selling his shot gun before leaving the country.   The section could be, and may have been, used as a loophole for the illegal importation of shot guns.   The second is that the firearm certificateprocedure, which is designed as a check on the suitability to possess dangerousfirearms e  residents of this country, does not cater for the needs of those whohave a legitimate use for such weapons in the course of a short visit, e.g. to takeport in a shooting competition.   It is accordingly proposed that section 1U of the1968 Act should be repealed, and there should be a new system of visitors1 permitsfor both shot guns and section 1 firearms.   Such a permit would be issued on theapplication of a responsible resident of this country prepared to sponsor the visitor70.   The new system would operate as follows.   A visitor1 s permit would be issued inrespect of a named individual, resident abroad, who proposed to visit this countrytemporarily.   It would specify the weapons to be covered in the same way as a firearmcertificate.   Application would be made by a resident of Great Britain prepared tosponsor the visitor, who would be required to provide information on the visitor&apos;date and port of arrival, length of stay and place of residence during the visit.The certificate would be granted only if the chief officer of police was satisfiedthat the requirements for the issue of on ordinary certificate were fulfilled, so for as he could reasonably ascertain, that the weapons were required only for usein connexion with target shooting or other sporting purposes, and that the sponsorwas a responsible person who had a genuine connexion with the visitor.   The permitwould be valid for up to six months, and would be produced by the visitor at the port of entry to enable the Customs to release the weapon for import.   This procedure would also be available for visitors wishing to buy weapons while in this country.There would be precautions to ensure, through the sponsor, that tho weapons wereproperly safeguarded while in this country and that they left the country with thevisitor.Antigua   firearms71.   Section 58(2) of the 1968 Act provides that nothing in the Act relating tofirearms shall apply to &quot;an antique firearm which is sold, transferred, purchased,acquired or possessed as a curiosity or   ornament&quot;.   &quot;Antique firearm&quot; is notdefined, and until recently many police forces regarded firearms over 100 years old,and most ancient muzzle-loading weapons, as antiques.   With the passage of time,however, this approach has ceased to be appropriate.   It is now more than 100 years- 27 -
since the- manufacture- of ,hroeoh-londing- fli-oai-mo hogoii-   Bocauso of the demand forreproductions of old weapons, ammunition for them was still being made in the 1960s.There are now breech-loading firearms over 100 years old which are capable of firingmetallic cartridges (in particular, pin-fire and teat-fire weapons) and for whichammunition is available or could be made to special order.   These weapons arepotentially as dangerous as modern weapons.   In some recent cases such weapons havebeen found in the possession of criminals.72.   There have been varying court decisions on the question what constitutes an&quot;antique firearm&quot;, and there is uncertainty among all those concerned.   It does not seem necessary to withdraw entirely the exemption for antiques, but it is important that all firearms capable of being used effectively in the same way as modernfirearms should be controlled, even if they are of historic interest.   It is accordingly proposed that the law should continue to exempt antique firearms keptas curiosities or ornaments. but should provide that no breech-loading firearmcapable  r:;&apos; firing, or designed to be capable of firin^., a self contained metalliccartridge (i.o. a cartridge consisting of its own case, primer, propollant andbullet) should be treated as an antique firearm for this purpose.   This new provision would leave the position relating to genuinely antique muzzle-loading weaponsunchanged.   Replicas of antiques, however, including replicas of muzzle-loadingweapons, should not benefit from the exemption, nor should antiques which are firedfrom time to time.   The possession of ammunition suitable for use with an antiquefirearm might go to show that the firearm was not possessed as a curio or ornament.In considering an application for a firearm certificate for an antique a chief officer of police would have regard to its alleged historic importance, and thereshould be no difficulty about the possession of such weapons by bona fide museums.Prohibitions on the possession of firearms73.   Section 21 of the Firearms Act 1963 provides that a person sentenced to imprisonment for three years or more, or to be detained for such a term in a young offenders institution in Scotland, shall be prohibited for life from possessing afirearm or ammunition.   A person sentenced to imprisonment for three months or morebut less than three years, or to such a term in a detention centre or a young offenders institution in Scotland, or to borstal training, is sajrdlarly prohibitedfor five years.   The Crown Court has power, on an application by the prohibitedperson, to remove the prohibition.   In the Government&apos;s view any person convicted of a crime involving violence, unless it was of a very minor nature, is nrimafade unfitted to possess a firearm or ammunition even if the court decided in thelight of all the circumstances that a custodial sentence should not be imposed.   Itis therefore proposed that any person convicted on indictment of an offence involvingviolence should be prohibited for life from possessing a firearm or ammunition.- 28 -
The power of the Crown Court to remove the prohibition should ensure that thisprovision did not operate too harshly or cause unreasonable hardship.Provisions not to be changed7ii.   Sir John McKay&apos;s Working Party reviewed the whole of the law and practicerelating to the control of firearms.   In many respects they found that theexisting arrangements were sound.   There are four points on which the Working Partyrecommended no change but which deserve mention.75&quot;.   The Working Party examined in detail the existing definition of a &quot;firearm&quot;for the purposes of the 1968 Act, including the question whether cartridge-operatedtools should be brought within this definition.   The Act defines a firearm as alethal barrelled weapon from which any shot, bullet or other missile can be fired.Weapons discharging gas or noxious liquid, components of firearms, and accessoriesdesigned to diminish the noise or flash caused by firing, are expressly included.The Working Party concluded that this definition was sound, had stood the tesi oftime, and would be very difficult to improve; and that on present information itwas not necessary to bring cartridge-operated tools under the firearm certificatecontrol.   But it is proposed in paragraph 35 that power should be taken to extend the category of prohibited weapons.76.   It was suggested to the Working Party that a good dsn! of work and inconvenience would be avoided, with no significant loss of control, if firearmcertificates were valid for five years instead of three.   They concluded, however,that the existing three year period between renewals had proved satisfactory inpractice, and that any lengthening of this period would be bound to result in the review of the conditions attached to the certificate, and of the arrangements forsafe custody of the firearm, becoming too infrequent.77.   On occasion a firearm certificate is issued subject to a condition limiting its use to a specified area of land.   It was represented to the Working Party that, ifa certificate holder has a good reason for using the firearm, and is a suitableperson, such conditions should not be necessary.   The Working Party did not thinkthat there should be any statutory limitation on a chief officers&apos;s  generaldiscretion to impose conditions and thought that there might be   cases where the&quot;good reason&quot; for possessing a section 1 firearm applied only to a particular piece of land.   But they considered that, in exercising his discretion, a chief officers should bear in mind that the imposition of a territorial condition might be undulyrestrictive in some cases.   In the Government&apos;s view this consideration would apply with particular force to shot guns.- 29 -
78.   It was put to the Working Party that difficulties were experienced by someapplicants for firearm certificates who proposed to borrow or hire the firearms inquestion, including persons learning to use firearms.   The suggestion was made that there should be special forms of certificate for non-owners and for learners.The Working Party found no evidence of particular dangers or difficulties such asto warrant the introduction of provisional certificates for learners undersupervision, and they were aware of no provision in the 1968 Act which precludedthe issue of a firearm certificate to an applicant who did not own a firearm.They accordingly saw no need to propose amendments on these points.
SECTION 9.   AJR. WEAPONS79.   Air weapons come within the definition of a firearm for the purposes cf theFirearms Act 1968, but their possession does not require a firearm certificate unless they are of the type declared by Rules made by the Secretary of State to be specially dangerous.   As the figures in the Appendix demonstrate, air weaponsaccount for a high proportion of the offences known to the police involving theuse of firearms.   The misuse of air weapons occurs predominantly among young people.   Many of the offences in which they were used were committed by persons under the age of 21, and involved random shooting at people or property, or formsof bullying or hooliganism.   Such behaviour is deplorable, but the injury or damage caused is usually slight.   Air weapons also cause some tragic accidents, againusually involving young people, for example, a child&apos;s loss of an eye.   Though notpowerful, they can certainly be dangerous.80.   There is no definite information about the numbers of air weapons or about their owners and users.   It is ihought that the number of weapons is veryconsiderable.   Their main legitimate use is target shooting, which may often beof a casual nature.81.   There ore already a number of general restrictions on the possession and useof firearms, and of air weapons specifically, by young persons.   These have not proved sufficient to prevent the degree of misuse described in paragraph 79*Section 13 of this paper proposes that these restrictions should be simplified andtightened up, with the particular object of ensuring better supervision of youngpersons in those circumstances in wliich they are allowed to use firearms.   the amended restrictions could not reasonably be tightened much further.   They would,however, still fall far short of a total prohibition on the acquisition and use ofair weapons by young people.   They should help to contain the problem of misuse,but more cannot be expected of restrictions of this kind.82.   Air weapons are the cause of many injuries and accidents, and of considerable damage, but nearly all of a minor nature.   Although they con cause death or serious injury, they do so relatively rarely.   Nor are they used in serious crime,although they could be used to threaten.   If it were, nevertheless, thought thatthe situation described above warranted stricter legal provisions, these would haveto take the form of a certificate control, with certificates granted only to thosewho had good reasons for possessing air weapons.   If casual target shooting were accepted as a &quot;good reason&quot;, then most applications would be granted and the controls would have little effect.   If it were not accepted as a good reason, thenvery many applications would be refused, and the numbers of air weapons would bedrastically reduced.- 31 -
83.   The Government hesitate to suggest such a severe new restriction on a weaponwhich normally causes only minor injury or damage.   They accordingly propose nochanges in the existing statutory provisions cn air weapons, apart from thoseaffecting young persons described in section 13.   The Government are, however,aware of the concern which exists about the misuse of air weapons, and they would welcome views on this issue.Specially dangerous air weapons8/4..   Those air weapons declared to be &quot;specially dangerous&quot; by the Firearms(Dangerous Air Weapons) Rules 1969 (S.I   1969 No. kl) and in Scotland the Firearms(Dangerous Air Weapons) (Scotland) Rules 1969 (S.I. 1969 No.270(S.25)) are coveredby section 1 of the 1968 Act.   These Rules define specially dangerous air weaponsby reference to the kinetic energy of the missile on discharge.   This definitioncauses some practical difficulty, because the kinetic energy of the missile maybory both between different examples of the same weapon and between differentfirings of the same weapon.   But no better definition has been found.   Themajority of the air weapons concerned, however, are of the &quot;pump up&quot; type; thatis, the compressed air reservoir propelling the missile is not charged by a singleaction, but by repeated operation of a hand pump.   Such weapons are capable of varying performance, depending on the number of strokes on the pump at each firing.It is proposed that the Rules should be amended so as to place all &quot;pump up&quot; airweapons in the specially dangerous category.   This would help to remove the uncertainty about the scope of the present Rules.- 32 -

This would help to ramove the uncertainty about the scope of the present Rules.- 32 -
SECTION 10.   AlC-iUITITION85.   Section 1 of the Firearms Act 1968 applies to all ammunition except shot gunanmunition cf most types, blank cartridges, and ammunition for air v/weapons.Ammunition for rifles and pistols is subject to certificate control, and the purchase and possession of specified quantities must be authorised by a firearm certificate.Persons dealing in such ammunition must be registered as firearms dealers, andall transactions in the ammuniticn must be recorded in dealers&apos; registers and onfirearm certificates.   No change is proposed in those provisions relating toammunition for rifles and pistols.Shot gun ammunition86.   It is proposed in section 7 of this paper that shot guns should be made subjectto section 1 of the 1968 Act.   There would, however, be certain practical clifficultiein the way of applying section 1 to shot gun ammunition also.   The annual sale ofshot gun cartridges has been estimated at about 70 million, supplied through some,0CO retailers, often in quantities of between 50 and 100 rounds.   In rural areasit is important that there should be local suppliers of ammunition, not only as aconvenience for those in the locality, but also to make it unnecessary to keeplarge stocks in private premises where effective precautions against theft may bemore difficult.   A full certificate control on the purchase of shot gun ammunitionwould involve the recording of a vast number of transactions, imposing a considerableadministrative burden on dealers and the police, and some inconvenience for individual shot gun users.   A lesser degree of control would, however, avoid thesedrawbacks while achieving a worthwhile improvement in security.   It is accordingly proposed that:(a) chief officers of police should have   power to include in certificatesrelating to shot guns conditions requiring the safe keeping of shot gun ammunition!(b) it should be an offence for a person to buy or possess such ammunitionunless he holds a certificate for a shot gun or is authorised by the holderof such a certificate to buy or possess the ammunition on his behalf.87.   There is a growing practice of bulk buying by shooting syndicates.   under such arrangements the purchaser merely acts as a distributor to his friends, butif the full requirements of section 1 were applied, he would have to register asa dealer.   While it is not necessary to go this far, some precautions are desirableto ensure, so far as possible, that shot gun ammunition hold in large quantitiesdoes not fall into the hands of unauthorised persons.   The Government therefore propose that, in order to enable the police to inspect the security of premiseswhere quantities of shot gun ammunition are stored, those who hold shot gun ammunition in buljc should be required to obtain a special permit from the chief- 33 -
officer of police.   The police should be empowered to refuse the permit if thearrangements for storing the ammunition are inadequate or the applicant isunsuitable, and to lay down conditions relating to security arrangements.   Thispermit procedure should not apply to registered firearms dealers, but chief officers should be empowered to attach conditions to dealers&apos; registrationscovering the security arrangements for shot gun ammunition.   It should also bemade an offence to sell shot gun ammunition except on the production, of a certificatefor a shot gun.The ingredients of ammunition88.   The Firearms Act 1920 controlled the components or ingredients of ammunitionin the same way as ammunition itself. Components were, however, omitted from the definition of ammunition in the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1936.   This was probablybecause the controls as framed in the Act of 1920 would have required firmsmanufacturing and supplying cartridge wads and cases to be registered as firearmsdealers, and to keep the records required by the Act.   As a result, ammunition isnow defined in the Firearms Act 1968 in a way that appears not to includecomponents.89.   The reloading of cartridges by firearms enthusiasts is now common.Equipment, ranging from simple hand tools to sophisticated automatic machines, is available to private purchasers for the manufacture of ammunition.   The mainingredients of ammunition are the case, the bullet or shot, the powder, and thepercussion caps.   The powder in most ammunition is small-arm nitro compound(although occasionally shot gun ammunition contains gunpowder).   Gunpowder is controlled under the Control of Explosives Order   1953* but there are no controls over small-arm nitro compound or other components.   This means that persons notauthorised to possess ammunition can nevertheless acquire freely all the componentsneeded to make that ammunition.   In order to rectify this situation, while notpreventing the practice of reloading, and to cater for possible future developments,it is proposal that a person wishing to acquire small-armjiitro compound should berequired to obtain an authorisation from the chief officer of police; and that thereshould be power to apply this requirement by statutory instrument to other substancesused for the same purpose.
Air gun ammiffitipn90.   Most air gun aimaunition consists of inert lead pellets, or darts.   Themore powerful air weapons themselves are already subject to the section 1controls, and there is no general need to apply controls to conventional ammunition for air weapons.   There exists, however, a type of ammunition for air weapons whichhas a quantity of propellent attached to the bullet.   The propellant is self-igniting when subjected to the heat of the compression of air in the barrel.   Thisammunition makes the weapon considerably more powerful.   It is proposed thatself-igniting air gun ammunition should be covered by the controls over ammunition for rifles and revolvers.- 35 -
SECTION 11.   DEALING IN PIBEAEMS AND AMMUNITIONFirearms Dealers91.   Section 3 of the Firearms Act 1968 makes it an offence to carry on a businessinvolving the manufacture, sale, transfer, repair, test or proof of firearms orammunition without being registered as a firearms dealer.   Section 33 of the Actrequires each chief officer of police to keep a register of firearms dealers.Any person having a place of business in the police area is entitled to inclusion in this register, on furnishing the prescribed particulars and paying theprescribed fee,   unless:(a) he is prohibited under the Act from being registered (e.g. by reasonof having been convicted of crime, or being of unsound mind or under theage of 17)l or(b) the chief officer of police is satisfied that he cannot be permitted tocarry on business as a dealer in firearms without danger to the public safetyor to the peace.There is a right of appeal to the Crown Court against a refusal of registration.92.   In considering an application for registration, the chief officer of policetakes account of the character, antecedents and background of the applicant, his experience and knowledge of firearms, and the security of his premises.   But thechief officer\s power to refuse registration is negative and limited.   He isrequired to register the applicant unless he has concrete evidence, of a kind that could be given in the Crown Court in the event of an appeal, that the public safetyor the peace would otherwise be endangered.   If, for instance, nothing is known about the applicant, the chief officer has no alternative but to register him.   Theapplicant does not have to make out a case for registration, although registrationentitles him to hold and trade in large quantities of firearms.   This is a strikingcontrast with the much stricter test which must be satisfied in order to obtain acertificate even for a single section 1 firearm.93-   In the Government&apos;s view, the stringent controls over firearms in private handsought to be matched by an equally strict control over dealers.   The plea that thereshould be almost unfettered freedom to engage in trade, even in lethal weapons andammunition, is no longer valid in present circumstances.   The government accordinly propose that those wishingi to deal in firearms and ammunition should be registered only if their personal suitability is positively established to the satisfaction of the chief officer and their premises are suitable for the safekeeping of firearms and ammunition.   Meanwhile consultations will be held withchief officers of police with a vieif to the formulation of guidance on the security precautions required in such premises.- 36 -CONFIDENTIAL
Hail order sales of firearms and ammunition9li.   The present law contains no provisions governing the methods of sellingfirearms and ammunition.   There are no restrictions on mail order sales.   As aresult, dangerous firearms and ammunition can be sent long distancoii unattended,by methods which provide no security against theft on route.   Some mail orderdealers take care to send weapons and ammunition by a secure method, but there isno legal requirement to do so.   In the case of those firearms and ammunition forwhich a certificate is required, the certificate has to be sent to the seller sothat he  can satisfy himself, before dispatching the goods, that their possessionis authorised by the certificate in question.   But he has no means of checkingwhether the person ordering^the firearms or ammunition is the holder of thatcertificate.   Air weapons, for which no certificate is required, are widely used by ycung people, and the law prohibits their purchase by anyone under the age of17.   A mail order dealer has no means of being certain of the age of the purchaser of an air weapon.   These risks of evasion of the law are inherent inmail order sales, and could not all be removed by the introduction of newsafeguards or restrictions falling short of prohibition.   There are accordinglygrounds for suggesting that mail order is an unsuitable method of trading indangerous weapons and ammunition, and the Government would welcome comment on theproposal that mail order sales of firearms and ammunition should be banned.Dealing in firearms as a hobby95.   Apart from providing inadequate control over the suitability of firearmsdealers and their premises, the present law means that the chief officer mustregister any person who produces colourable evidence that he intends to buy andsell firearms on a reasonably regular basis, even if he is doing so, in effect, asa hobby.   Sir John McKay&apos;s V7orking Party found that both the Association of ChitfPolice Officers and the gun trade were concerned about the numberof dealers operating from private houses.   Apart from the resultant securitydangers, the &apos;.&quot;orking Party found evidence that some part-time dealershad not been scrupulous in observing tho law, and that&apos;some firearms, , -had reached unauthorised hands from such dealers.   It is proposed that persons who wish to deal in firearms as a side line or hobby from a private residence should nolonger be entitled to registration.   Registration should be granted only to thosewho ore full-time dealers, or whose dealing in firearms is a reasonable ancillaryto their main business, and whoso premises are considered satisfactory by the police.This change will inevitably put a stop to what is, for some people, an entertaining,and perhaps a profitable, activity, but in the Government&apos;s view, considerations of public security must be paramount.- 37 -
Young dealers96.   It is an anomaly that persons trader the age of majority, who are not regardedas old enough to control all their personal affairs, should nevertheless be eligible for registration as dealers in lethal firearms and ammunition.   The newtest of personal suitability for registration proposed in paragraph 93 will mean that the chief officer will be able to take comparative youth into account in considering an application.   But it would not in any event be appropriate tolicense minors to deal in arms, and it is proposed that the age of majority shouldhe tho minimum age for registration as a firearms dealer.Dealers&apos; Registers97.   Section kO of the Firearms Act 1968 requires firearms dealers to keep a register of all transactions.   Schedules k and 9 of the Act prescribe the particulars to be entered, the form of the register, and the manner in which theregister is to be kept.   These provisions aie designed to ensure that details of firearms and transfers of firearms are recorded, as an additional check againstleakage into unauthorised hands.   The maintenance of these records imposes aconsiderable administrative burden on dealers.   The Working Party examined, inparticular, the difficulties caused by the manner of keeping records of transactions involving shot guns now prescribed.   It was represented to them thatthere is a less onerous method of keeping records used by some shot gun dealerswhich enables them to account for all shot guns in their possession and to providethe police with any information which might be required about a particular weapon.It is accordingly proposed that the law should be amended to allow chief officersof police to exempt, from the requirement to keep registers in the prescribed form,dealers and manufacturers who keep other records of a kind satisfactory to thepolice.98.   Dealers&apos; records can contribute to the investigation of crime by making it possible to trace weapons sold some time before.   There is, however, no requirementon dealers to retain their registers and supporting documents for any minimum period of time.   Such a requirement would not impose a large burden on dealers.It is proposed that dealers should be required toi retain their registers and other documents for a minimum period of 5 years after the last transaction.99.   The police sometimes experience difficulty in checking the registers of adealer who has more than one place of business.   In order to remove this difficulty, it is proposed that a dealer should be required to keep a separateregister for each separate place of business and to record transfers of weaponsbetween these separate places of business.   This requirement could be waived byIb-e chief officer in the circumstances described in paragraph 97, where he was- 38 -
satisfiod that the records, although kept in a different way, wore adgj^ate^orthe purposes of recording transfer^ between premises.Gane^ fjiirs100.   The law at present makes no provision for a firearms dealer to set uptemporary premises at a game fair or similar exhibition, which niay take place inr. a different part of the country each year.   There should be no need for an established dealer to take out a separate registration with the police in such circumstances.   It is proposed that the law should permit a dealer to exhibit ata game fair or similar exhibition if he obtains from the chief officer of policefor the area of the fair a temporary permit, which should impose appropriateconditions as to security.Repairs etc. by dealers101.   Sections 3(3) and 8(2)(b) of the 1968 Act require a firearms dealer whoreceives a weapon for purposes of repair, testing or proof to make sure, on receiving it, that it is held under the appropriate certificate.   The government agree with representations from the gun trade that the law should be amended torequire the dealer to see a certificate authorizing possession of a weaponreceived for repair etc., not when it is brought in, but before handing it back.This arrangement would be both more convenient and a better protection against these weapons falling into the wrong hands.Firearms and ammunition in transit and in store102.   Concern has been expressed, with cause, about the security of firearms andammunition in transit.   Section 9 of the 1968 Act permits a person carrying on thebusiness of a carrier, or his servant, to possess a firearm or ammunition withouta certificate in the ordinary course of his business.   Section 9 also applies toa warehouseman, who can store firearms and ammunition without a certificate in thecourse of his business.   In short, carriers and warehousemen are exempt from thefirearms controls.   Moreover there have been incidents which show that not allfirearms dealers act responsibly over the question of security in transit.   Thereis no specific provision in the present lav; to prevent large quantities of firearms and ammunition being transported about the country or stored with noproper protection against theft or against hi-jacking of lorries used for their transport.   The Working Party received some evidence to show that, even today,this can happen.- 39 -
103.   Large consignments of firearms are likely to originate only from registereddealers.   Chief officers of police have power to attach conditions to the registration of firearmo dealers, and could include on a dealer&apos;s certificate acondition requiring hira to ensure that all firearms or ammunition which hetransports, sends, collects or stores in the United Kingdom are handled in conditions of adequate security.   The precise nature of such a condition in acertificate would vary according to the circumstances.   It is most important thatsuch conditions should he practicable, and, so far as possible, enforceable.   Itis accordingly proposed that the Home Departments should consult chief officersof police, the gun trade, and transport interests, with a view to devising a range of suitable conditions requiring the secure transportation and storage of firearm,&apos;;and ammunition, to be made a condition of registration as a dealer.   Conditions ofthis kind can also be included, as required, in firearm certificates.- UO -CONFIDENTIAL
SECTION 12.   RIFLE CLUBS, CADET CORPS AND SHOOTING GALLERIESClubs and Cadet Corps101;.   Section 11(3) of the Firearms Act 1968 permits a member of a rifle club,miniature rifle club or cadet corps approved by the Secretary of State to possessa firearm and ammunition without a firearm certificate, when he is &quot;engaged as amember of the club or corps in, or in connexion with, drill or target practice&quot;.A member who wishes to use a firearm or ammunition in any other circumstances mustobtain a certificate.   When an application for the Secretary of State&apos;s approval ofa club is received, it is the practice of the Home Departments to ask theappropriate chief officer of police to make enquiries about the bona fides of theclub, and to confirm that a range safety certificate, issued by the militaryauthorities and covering the appropriate categories of weapons, has been issued foreach range to be used by the club.   There are no reliable figures of clubscurrently approved, but the number is believed to be about 5,000 in England ardWales.10^.   It is unsatisfactory that the safeguards relating to clubs, where numbers ofarms and quantities of ammunition are kept, should be less strict than those relating to individuals.   There is no provision for the checking and re-approval ofclubs; once approved they do not have to re-apply.   There is no po. or to imposesonditions on their approval.   Ciroumst:noes covld rjrise where the continued.c;ijx*ovol ..ould not be justified if unsuitable offioers -/ere appointed or securityboconoc leas - but this might not cone to notice.   These weaknesses in the present law -..OIV.0. no longer exist if the procedure and sa^guards for tho control of clubsapproximated more closely to the firearm certificate procedure.   This could be doneviihout placing unnecessary new restrictions on those who wish to enjoy the sport oftarget shooting,106.   The National Rifle Association and the National Small-bore Rifle Associationtold Sir John McKay&apos;s Working Party that they wished fciae Secretary of State tocontinue to be the approving authority because, in their view, the present arrangements worked well.   As a matter of practice, however, the Secretary ofState relies on the advice of the chief officer of  police in deciding whether to approve a club.   There is no reason why the approval of clubs, as distinct fromcadet corps (under the control of the Ministry of Defence), should be a function of central Government while the issue of firearm certificates is not.   chief officers are in a better position to obtain and assess the relevant facts and tomaintain continuing supervision.
107.   It is accordingly proposed that in future the approval of a club should takethe form of a firearm certificate issued^ to^the^responsible officT^of the clubby the chief officer of poli.ce for the area in which the clu&apos;o&apos;s premises are situated or, if the club has no permanent premises, by the chief officer fcr thoarea in which the responsible officer of the club resides.   This procedure wouldhave several advantages.   Approval would no longer be permanent, and could bekept under review.   It would be made clear that conditions is to security andother matters could be imposed and regularly reviewed.   It would ensure thatcomprehensive records were kept of firearms and ammunition in the possession ofclubs and of transfers of firearms.   There would be rights of appeal tc theCrown Court, as with ordinary certificates.108.   During 1971 an armoury at a rifle club was broken into by a criminal and oneof the stolen firearms was subsequently used by the criminal to murder a policeofficer.   Rifle club armouries are likely to contain a number of firearms and manyrounds of ammunition.   For this reason, and because the existence of the armourywould be known locally, it is likely to receive attention from those who wish toobtain firearms end ammunition for criminal or subversive purposes.   This is a consideration which chief officers of police would have to bear in mind when considering what security conditions to attach to certificates for rifle clubs.Miniature rifle ranges and shooting galleries109.   Section 11(a) of the 1968 Act permits a person conducting or carrying on aminiature rifle range (whether for a rifle club or otherwise, and whether or notthe club is approved by the Secretary of State) or a shooting gallery at which only air weapons cr miniature rifles not exceeding .23 inch calibre are used, toacquire and possess such rifles, and their ammunition, without a certificate.Any person may, without holding a certificate, use any such rifle ana ammunitionat such a range or gallery.   The miniature rifle range or shooting gallery is awell established and popular feature of fairgrounds and amusement parks.   TheWorking Party found no reason for prohibiting or curbing this traditional form ofamusement.   The wording of the present law is, however, wide enough to permit theuse at these ranges and galleries of certain powerful smnll-bore military weapons which have been developed in recent years.   It is accordingly proposed that thepresent exemption for miniature rifle ranges and shooting galleries should be amended so as to exempt only those miniature rifles chambered for cartridges nolarger than those commonly known as .22 Long Rifle cartridges.   This change wouldhave the effect of excluding from the exemption all the powerful military rifleswith a calibre of less than .23 inch, while allowing the use of the type of.22 rifle which has long been used in fairground galleries and other miniaturerifle ranges.
110.   There is no sufficient reason why persons who conduct these ranges and galleries should bo exempt from the requirement to obtain a firearm certificate.On the contrary, there ought to be   safeguards to ensure the suitability of these persons, and the security of the  weapons and ammunition.   There was a recenttragedy in which 3 French tourists were killed by a man armed with a rifle stolenfrom a fairground; enquiries revealed that this rifle had been left in insecureconditions.   Accordingly, it is proposed that a person carrying on a miniaturerifle range or a sheeting gallery should be on the same footing as other persons as respects the requirement to obtain a firearm certificate for all weapons andammunition to which the certificate procedure applies.   The certificate should include general conditions:for the safe keeping of the rifles and ammunition, forexample, that when the gallery was closed the rifles should be removed to a securecabinet.   The certificate should be issued by the chief officer of police for thearea of the applicant&apos;s normal residence, and the certificate and the conditions should be valid in any part of Great Britain to which the range or gallery Mijftfrmight be moved.
SECTION 13-   YOUNG PERSONS111,   The existing law, contained in Sections 22 to 2k of the Firearms Act 1963incorporates; a variety of restrictions on the possession and use of firearms bythe young.   These have bean introduced from time to time over the last  0 years.O They are now complicated, anomalous and out of date.   Further complication iscaused by the parallel existence of restrictions on the sale, hire or gift of firearms by adults to young persons.   For example, there is a general requirement,that a child under lit may not use any firearm unless properly supervised.   Thisage was chosen because it is the dividing age between a child and a young person for the purposes of the Children and Young Persons Actsj that distinction iswithout significance for trie quite different purposes of firearms control.   Togive another example, children under 1f? are prohibited (with certain exceptions)from having shot guns in their possession.   This was partly because 1f? was theschool leaving age at -the time this restriction was introduced.   The school leaving age is now 16, and nobody under that age can now have a full tine job(e.g. in gamekeejdng) which might require him to use a shot gun unsupervised.112.   The Government accept the view, which has long been held, that the law shouldmake proper provision for introducing the young to the use of firearms, and for enabling them to receive proper instruction, provided always that adequatesupervision is given by a responsible adult.   Judging by the disturbing number ofinjuries to young persons regularly caused by other young persons, especially inthe 1JU. to 16 age group, and especially by the misuse of air weapons, the existing law is not sufficiently effective for this purpose.   In addition to injuries caused to persons, strong concern was expressed to the Working Party by the national farmers&apos; Union about damage caused in the countryside by young persons withfirearms.113*   The Government propose that the lav; on firearms and the young should be madeboth stricter and simpler, and should be as follows:(a)   Prohibitions applying to all those under the age of 1 8i.     The buying or hiring of a firearm of any kind*     Tne possession of any Section 1 firearm, unless it is being carriedfor a certificate holder, or is being used as a member of an approved rifle club or cadet corps in the course of practice ordrill, or is being used at a miniature rifle rang^e or shootinggallery
-*-^-*     Tjie possession of a shot gion or air weapon in a public-plane unless it :1s securely fastened in a gun cover so that it cannot be firedor unless under the supervision of an adult.(b) iProhibitions-applying only to those under 16.^&apos;    Tha possession of a shot gun in a private place, unless in thecircumstances specified in (a) iii.ii.     Tha possession of an air weapon in a public place other than ashooting gallery, or in private unless under xhe supervision ofan adult and then^on condition that no missile is fired beyondthe premises on which the firing occurs.(c) Prohibitions applying to all personsi.     The sale or hire of any firearm to a person under 18.ii.    Giving or parting with the possession of a firearm in circumstances where the recipient would be prohibited under (a) or (b) from having it in his possession.- 45 -
SECTION 1k.   IMITATION FIREARMS111..   Replica firearms capable of firing are subject to control under the 1968Act.   There is, however, a range of exact replicas of firearms,, widely on sale inthis country, which are designed so that they cannot be fired.   This range includesexact replicas of a sub-machine gun and of most of the common types of revolversand pistols.   Even an expert would find difficulty in distinguishing them fromgenuine firearms by locking at them.   Their conversion into weapons which could befired, however, would require expert knowledge and workmanship, and sophisticatedequipment.   Even then, because of the soft metal of which they are made, it isdoubtful whether they could be fired without danger of malfunction or explosion.As the law stands, these replicas are not subject to control.115.   In addition to exact replicas, which are relatively expensive, there are also some widely available and relatively cheap children&apos;s toy firearms which, although not exact replicas, are realistic.   To inexpert eyes, or in poor light, or fr^m a distance, and particularly in situations of stress, they could be mistaken forgenuine firearms,   The same is true of air pistols and starting pistols, for which no firearm certificate is required.116.   The law heavily penalises the use of imitation firearms for criminal purposes.It is an offence to carry an imitation firearm with intent to commit anindictable offence, or to possess an imitation firearm at the time of committingor being arrested for a wide variety of offences.   The Criminal Justice Act 1972has increased the maximum penalty for these offences to 1li years&apos; imprisonment.   Itis nevertheless quite widely felt that to penalise actual criminal uses of imitationfirearms is not sufficient, and that the availability of realistic imitationfirearms should be restricted..117&apos;   Sir John McKay&apos;s Working Party doubted whether the availability of exactreplicas contributed significantly to crime, given the ready availability of many other things, including toy pistols and air pistols, which could be and were used by criminals and which could not readily be distinguished from lethal weapons bythoae unfamiliar with guns.   The Working Party saw few legitimate uses for thesereplicas, however, apart from use by theatre companies.   They acoordingly suggestedthat it would be desirable to ban their general sale, if some way could be found of doing so without interfering with the sale of children&apos;s toys or starting pistols.They pointed out that it would be difficult to devise a definition which avoidedsuch interference, since if the new restrictions applied only to exact replicas,manufacturers would be able to take their products outside the scope of the banby making some minor alteration.
G;.......118.   The firearm certificate procedure is designed for the control of lethalweapons.   Any ban on imitations which, by definition, were not in themselvesdangerous would rest on a totally different footing.   The basic case for such aban is that imitation firearms can be used to threaten, thereby facilitating crime,and accordingly it is wrong that they should be so widely available.   Moreovertheir use for criminal purposes may lead to a shooting incident, and this mayendanger innocent bystanders, even though the imitations themselves cannot be fired.Any ban imposed on this basis would, however, have to extend to all reasonablyrealistic imitations if it were to achieve its purpose.   Little would be gained bybanning exact or nearly exact replicas, which are relatively expensive, becausemany other cheaper, and quite realistic, imitation firearms would remain fullyavailable.119.   In considering the possibility of a ban, therefore, three difficulties arise.The first concern   the design of children&apos;s toys.   If realistic toy firearms wereprohibited manufacturers and importers would have to take special care that tncirtoy firearms were not likely to be mistaken for the real thing, and the age oldchildren&apos;s tradition of playing with realistic toy weapons would, in relation tofirearms, be much affected.   Second, it would not be practicable to ban the possession, as well as the manufacture, import and sale of realistic imitations.There are many thousands of these imitations and replicas in circulation, and a legal requirement to hand them in or destroy them would bo unenforceable.   Third,air weapons and starting pistols are not imitations, and they have legitimateuses.   The would have to be excluded from the ban, and would remain available foruse by criminals so inclined.120.   A further difficulty concerns who would decide what was a   realisticimitation firearm.   If this were left to the courts to decide when a prosecutionwas brought, manufacturers, importers and retailers would have no means of beingsure in advance whether they were contravening the law.   It has been suggested that,in order to overcome this difficulty, there should be a vetting committee forimitation firearms, consisting of representatives of appropriate interests, whowould recommend to the Secretary of State whether or not a particular imitationsubmitted to them should be banned.   Upon receipt of a recommendation to ban a specified imitation he would make an order prohibiting the importation, manufactureor sale of that imitation.   If a person submitting an imitation to the committee was informed that they had decided to make no such recommendation to the Secretary ofState, this would establish in the law that it was not covered by the ban.   TheGovernment welcome this constructive suggestion, which would offer certainty tothose concerned about their position under the law.
121.   Tho Government recogni.se the widely held view that, despite the difficultiesoutlined in paragraph 119.. something ought to be done about imitation firearms.This is a problem on which they would particularly welcome the views of all concerned,including parents and other members of the general public.   They accordingly putforward for comment the proposition that there shoul^b^e^jan on the manufacture,import and sale of realistic imitations (including toys) which, whether or not theyare exact replicas, are reasonably likely to^bejnistaken for g^enui^o^ir^arms^Imitations subject to this ban should be specified in orders made by the Secretaryof State on the recommendation of a vetting committee, as dcscribed in paragraph 120.- HQ -
SECTION 15.   PENALTIES122.   Offences against firearms law, even lesser offences committed thoughtlesslyrather than wilfully, may have serious or tragic consequences.   The penalties for offences under the Firearms Act have axready been reviewed, ana tne maximumpenalties for a number if then have been raised by the Criminal Justice Act 1972.The offences of possessing a firearm with intent to end-mger life, and using afirearm to resist arrest, both now carry      a maximum sentence of lifeimprisonment.   The maximum sentence for the offences of carrying a firearm orimitation firearm with intent to commit an indictable : ffence, and possessing afirearm while committing any cne of ?. number of specified offences, is now 1^years&apos; imprisonment.   The maximum fines for all Firearms Act offences triedsummarily have also been increased, partly to take account of the change in thevalue of money since they were last revised in 1965.123- The offence under section 2(1) of the Firearns Act 1968 of possessing a shotgun without a certificate is not at present triable on indictment.   Tho offence under section 1(1) of possessing a section 1 firearm without a firearm certificatecan be tried on indictment and carries a maximum penalty of three years&apos;inprisonment.   In view of the extent to which shot guns are now used in crime,and the proposal to apply the section 1 controls to them, this difference nolonger seeas justifiable.   It is accordingly propose:! that it should be possiblein more serious cases to try the offence of possessing a shot gun without acertificate on indictment with a maximum.penalty of three years1 imprisonmentas   with scotion 1 firearms ^-h9-
SECTION 16.   A FIREARMS AMNESTY124. This Green Paper has set out the Government&apos;s proposals for tightening thelaw on firearms.   Legislation is not, however, the only neons by v/hich the availability of firearms to criminals can be reduced.   On seven occasions since1933 there have been firearms amnesties (that is, appeals for the surrender of firearms coupled with assurances that those surrendering them would not be prosecuted for possessing them without a certificate).   An amnesty provides thosein illegal possession of firearms with an opportunity to dispose of them withoutfear cf prosecution, so reducing the number of illegally held firearms in circulation.   The practice has been for the Home Secretary to consult chief officers of police about the desirability of an amnesty, and then to ask them notto prosecute for illegal possession persons handing in firearms during tho amnesty.Corresponding action is taken in Scotland.   The last amnesty was held in 1968,immediately before the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1967 about shot -&quot;incertificates came into operation; over one third of the firearms handed in thenwere unwanted shoe gunsa125* The figures of firearms handed in during previous amnesties suggest thatthere are considerable numbers of illegally held firearms which v/ill be handed inv;hen their possessors are given the opportunity to do this without fear ofprosecution.   If amnesties v/ere too frequent, the impression might be given thatthe illegal possession of firearms was not a serious offence, and those holdingfirearms without certificates might be encouraged to retain them in the belief that there would always be an opportunity to hand them in next time there was an amnesty.   It is, however, more than five years since the last amnesty, and in theGovernments view the tine has como to hold another.   The Government are accordingly in consultation with chief officers of police about whether on amnestyshould be hold as soon as practicable or whether it would be preferable, if legislation on the lines set out in this paper is enacted, that an amnesty shouldbe held immediately preceding the date on v/hich the legislation comes into force.This consultation will also cover the detailed arrangements for the amnesty, andwill include consideration of the suggestion that the sale of illegally heldweapons to firearms dealers should be permitted, subject to suitable safeguards,as well as handing in to the police.   The amnesty will be complementary to theproposals in this Green Paper, and will constitute a further important aspect ofthe steps which the Government is proposing in the drive against armed crime.-50-

Certain analysesof these are given in Tables 1-21.   The data for 1969-1971 were taken frompolice reporting documents introduced in 19&amp;9.   Earlier figures were obtained from a report   on firearms in crime published in 1970.do not, in general, distinguish between offences which involve firearmsand those which do note   The only exception to this is for offences underthe Firearms, Act 1968.   Thus, statistics of sentences awarded for offences3under the Firearms Act   form the only measure available of the way courtsdeal with offenders guilty of offences involving firearms.   Some of thesestatistics are given in Tables 2.2 and 23 which also give details of thenumber of persons cautioned as an alternative to prosecution for the variousoffences under the Firearms Act.
Offences under sections 16 to 18 of the Act are indictable and are,therefore, included amongst the &quot;offences recorded as known to the police&quot;in Tables 1 to 2.I, where they are shown under &quot;Assaults&quot;.   Persons foundguilty of, or cautioned for, these offences are included in Tables 1Z and23.

OITOICES RECORDED AS IglOV/T? TO THE POLICE II! V/KICII FIRSARKS WERE INVOLVEDTable 1 shows the number of offences recorded an known to the police inwhich firearms were involved.   The columns headed &quot;firearms used&quot; ond&quot;firearms carried&quot; cover mainly those cases where a firearm was involvedin the offence because it was a weapon, though the &quot;firearms used&quot; columnalso covers cases where a firearm was vised as a tool eg to facilitateentry into a building.   The columns headed &quot;firearms dishonestly acquired&quot;cover those cases where the firearm v/as involved merely as a piece ofproperty.From the table, it will be noted that the rate of increase in the numberof offences in which a firearm was used is somewhat greater than the ratesof increase in the other two groups.Clearlyv the police can only record offences which come to their notice;equally they can only record such details of an offence as they are ableto discover.   The presence of a firearm in an offence in which it was carried,but not used, would be less likely to come to police notice then the presenceof a firearm in an offence in which it was used.   Also, there is a lowerlikelihood that a theft of a firearm for which no certificate was held wouldbe reported than that a theft of a legally, held firearm would be reported.For these reasons, the true relative sizes of the groups are difficult to assess. . ..... .OFF NC S    INl WH\CH   FAftEfiftMS   l-J fi     USg.frrt^e [f aa^&amp;s?Table 2 gives further details about the types of offences recorded as knownto the police in which firearms were used,   Ac can be seen, there wereTABLE 1TABLE 2

substantial increases in both the major offence groups -- assaults zu&amp;robberies.TABLE stable 3 shows the types of weapon involved in offences in v:h:which firciu-iiiswere usede   An analysis of this table shows that the use of air weaponshas increased faster than tho total use of all other types of weapon.   the proportionate uses of long-barrelled shot guns and pistols fell, despite the fact that the actual number of offences in v/hich these weapons were used increased considerably.TABLE 4-Table A shows the types of weapon used in certain specific offences in   *1969-711.   The offences shown under the headings shot gun, rifle and pistolin this table account for about 85^ of all offences involving the use ofsuch weapons in this period.Table 5 shows that in about half the offences no injury was caused by firearmsmost of the offences in v/hich there was no injury were robberies where thefirearm was used to threaten, although in some of them the firearm was firedand caused property damage only.TABLE 5&quot;It can be seen from Table G that in each year more than half the fatalinjuries were caused by shot guns.   Pistols and rifles accounted aboutequally for the remaining deaths.   On the other hand, most non-fatal injuii.eswere caused by air weapons - about 72% in 1967, rising to Sy% in 1971-

ROBBERIES IN WHICH FIREARMS WERE USEDThere are sorac incidents which contain the ingredients of more than one:offence.   For example, an armed raid in which someone is killed may con-stitute both a robbery and u murder.   It would, however, be recorded as one offence known to the poli.ee, namely a murder.   Similarly, some offencesmay be classified as manslaughters or assaults although they also contain the ingredients of robbery.

The situation changed once more in 1971, with a move backtowards banks and post offices again.Of the weapons used in robberies, an increasing proportion were shot guns,especially sawn-off shot guns (see Table 1S.).   While robberies in whichfirearms wore used more than doubled in the period 1967-71, use of shotguns in robberies more titan trebled.

OTHER OFFENCES IN WHICH FIREARMS WERE USEDOver 9*$ of the offences recorded as known to the police in which firearmswere used were assaults (including homicides) or robberies.   The remainder were largely offences of burglary, theft or malicious damage.   There were also about 20 sexual assaults during the period 19&amp;7-1971 in which firearmswere used to threaten!   these form a very small proportion of all sexualassaults.Table 16 shows the types of firearm used in offences other than assaultsand robberies.   The types of firearm used in burglaries and thefts were mainly air weapons (often used c-s a means of effecting entry) i shot gunsand imitation weapons.   About   of the offences of malicious damage involve!air weapons, shot guns accounting for moot of the remainder.TABLE 16Offences other than assaults and robberiesin which firearms were used:type of weapon1967-197&apos;5number cf offences			t3 0 H								0 M	Pistol	I	h 1:0  O n M 0 0	?.p	0 a si	1  Starting gu	Fl O -H -P $ t M	Supposed	1 0 3 0	&apos;H u 0 &amp; -p 0	S3 11967	6	10	6								28											1968	3	8	2	^ 						s	20.											1969	16	33	16	1	1	2		3		1 .	7?1970	\ 7	2h	9	5	5	3	8	-	3		641971	3	hk	15	2	h	2	14	2	-	1	89

Table 19   shows the types of offence in which firearms were dishonestlyacquired.   Host of the offences in this group were burglaries or theftsin which a firearm was ctolcn.   Frauds and forgeries involving firearmsincreased from 21 in 19^9 to 5li in 1971 but still formed a very small proportion of the total (about 2-^&apos;).

These &quot;other weapons&quot; token were mainly rifles and pistols,although a substantial number of starting guns were stolen.   Well over halfthe starting guns-were taken from schools.   Indeed in almost 70fi of theftsand burglaries iu which firearms were stolen from schools, a starting gunwas taken - air weapons were taken in 11$ and rifles in 8% of the offences.The &quot;other firearms&quot; shown In Table ?.0     were mostly antique weapons.Table Z I    &quot; shows that in over half the offences, the firearms were taken from residential premises or shops and stalls.   It is not known how many ofthe shops and stalls wore occupied by registered, firearms dealers.   Thenumber of offences in which weapons were taken from rifle clubs or militaryestablishments fell slightly between 1969 and 1971.TA^L-G   2.1

OFFENCES UNDER THE FIREARMS ACT 1y6oThe FirGarms Act .1968 specified ovex1 8-0 different offences relating tothe possession, supply and certification of firearms.   Not many of theseoffences are indictable (and thus recorded ac known to the police, and included in Tables 1-2.1;. . Details relating to those offences under theFirearms Act which are not indictable arc kept only when persons oreproceeded against, or cautioned by the police as an alternative to prose-cution, for such offences.   Thus the only statistics available which relateto the Firearms Act as o. whole are of persons proceeded against or cautioned.Figures, for 1969 to 1971 of the number of pe.vr.ons found guilty and thenumber of persons cautioned are summarised in Table 22.Tho number of persons found guilty of offences under the Firearms Act rose from 4392 in 1969 to 5927 in 1971* an increase of 35$*   The number of personscautioned rose during the same period from ^hS to 79^3, an increase of 101^.By far the largest increase was in persons dealt with for offences undersection 2(1) of the Act - possession of a shot gun without a certificate:the number of persons found guilty went up from 669 in 1969 to l&apos;:?.9 in 1971and the number cautioned went up from 880 to &apos;l007 during the same period.The ways in which courts dealt with persons found guilty of offences underthe Firearms Act 1968 are shown in Table 25,   The vast majority of ,theseoffenders are dealt with at magistrates  courts and are fined.   -The levelof fines .has not changed much since 1969 - about f of the persons; finedare fined under  5*TABLE 22TAULC Zl
