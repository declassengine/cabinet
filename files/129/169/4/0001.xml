A MID-TERM POPULATION CENSUS IN 1976Memorandum by the Central Policy Review staff. The arguments in favour of a 1976 Census are not in dispute.    Theonly arguments against are possible unpopularity, and cost.2. As the Secretary of State for Social Services&apos; memorandum pointsout, the shorter questionnaire and an effective public relations campaignwould do much to obviate public objection.    In this context it is worth noting that the Population Panel&apos;s recommendation for a 1976 Census has attracted little attention or outcry.3. So far as cost is concerned, the sums involved, year by year, are:1975-76 1976-77 Subsequent TotalYears 6.8m  5.8m  2m  14.6m4, At the present time the Cabinet is seeking to find savings of 300- 400 million in 1976-77 to re-escablish the contingency reserve.The cost of the Census is thus very small in relation to the other savingsbeing sought.5. The 1971 Census showed that about one-eighth of the population movehouse each year.    As the decision to take a mid-term sample census in1966 recognised, the structure and distribution of population is now changingso fast that a Census once every ten years simply cannot providesufficiently up-to-date information for effective decision-taking inmany important and sensitive areas of policy.    These include housing,town planning, transport, regional policy, immigration and race relations,and aspects of employment policy.COPY NOiCP(73) 4430 March 1973CABINET
6. Ministers are concerned with improving decision-taking iti bothCentral and local Government.    The question before Ministers is notwhether they can afford a mid-term Census, but whether they can affordnot to collect information which is necessary to provide an up-to-date base for decision-taking,recommendation. The Central Policy Review Staff recommends that:i. The proposal for a 1976 Census should not be rejected.ii. Financial provision be found for it in the context of thecurrent public expenditure exercise.Cabinet Office30 March 19732
