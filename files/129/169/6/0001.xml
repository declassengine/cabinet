CP(73) 46 COPY NO 6S30 March 1973CABINETHOUSING policy memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Home department. Paragraph 23 of the White Paper &quot;The Programme for controlling Inflation:  Second Stage&quot; (Cmnd 5205) said:   &quot;TheGovernment . . . therefore intend before the next stage of the policycomes into operation to bring forward proposals which will increasethe availability of building land and reduce the extent to which it ispossible for people to make disproportionately high profits fromtransactions in land. &quot;   In his Budget Statement, the Chancellor of theExchequer indicated that a statement would be made before the end ofMarch;  but in the course of a debate on land and housing on 14 march the Secretary of State for the Environment said only that he would be putting forward proposals &quot;shortly&quot;.2. A group of Ministers under my chairmanship has been formulatingpolicy proposals for early announcement;  and as part of their tasK theywere invited by the Cabinet to consider possible measures for the stabilisation of mortgage finance.    They have come to the conclusionthat the Government&apos;s proposals should be announced by means of a white Paper, and hope to circulate a draft text for approval by theCabinet at their meeting on 5 April.    The Secretary of State for scotland will at the same time be circulating a draft Scottish White Paper, and i hope that both documents can be published on 9 April.MAIN PROPOSALS3. The main matters which we have discussed are as follows:-A.   Stabilisation of Mortgage Funds.    The Cabinet have already had a preliminary discussion about the very serious situation which has arisen as a result of the recent substantial outflow of funds investedwith Building Societies, in consequence of which the rate of interestpayable by borrowers is liable to be increased next week to at least10 per cent.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury inclines to the view that,provided that sufficient mortgage finance is available, an increase in the1
rate of interest to this level may have little effect on the output ofhouses.    Other members of the Group foresee two possible dang3?a:first, that the consequent increase in existing mortgage payments willthreaten counters-inflationary policies;  and second, that, notwithstanding the availability of adequate mortgage finance,there would be a loss ofconfidence in the building industry which would lead to a sharp down-turnin the house building programme.    This would have incalculable social and political consequences.    The immediate question is whether, to avert these dangers in the short term, some form of subsidy should begiven to the Building Societies.    One possible means of doing this wouldbe to reduce the composite rate of tax payable by the Building Societies.A limited reduction could be made by administrative means, but wouldmake possible only the lowering by ^ per cent for a period of 6 monthsof the interest rate charged to borrowers.    Action on these lines wouldhave to be taken without any publicity.    Anything further would involve legislation, and an overt subsidy.    The cost to the Exchequer of a reduc-tion of 1 per cent in the rate of interest would be about  10 million per month.    If such action were taken, it could be accompanied by measuresdirected tov/ards ensuring that the assistance provided by the Governmentwas used to increase the number of houses built rather than to force uphouse prices.    Such measures, which would have to be discussed withthe Building Societies, might include a. A temporary cesration of special advances (ie advancesexceeding  13, 000) so as to allow a greater concentration ofthe available funds on cheaper houses.b. Intensification of the preference already being given tofirst borrowers.c. Intensification of the existing policy of concentratingadvances on new houses.For the long term, the Group of Ministers considered that there should bediscussions with the Building Societies about the possibility of astabilisation scheme which would not require financial support by theGovernments.B.    Supply of Building Land.   It is proposed that there should benew guidelines for development control which would provide that, inrelation to the granting of planning permission by local authorities andthe determination of appeals by the Secretary of State, there would be ageneral presumption in favour of housing development unless there were serious planning objections.    It is also proposed that land should bemade available for housing development in certain limited parts of greenbelt areas where there would be no loss of genuine amenity, on the basis that such action would be wholly offset by continuing additions and improvements to the green belts.    (For example, the Group believes that there is about 2, 000 acres of land in London suburbs and the Home2
Counties where  the boundary of the green belt encloses land which public opinion would not recognise as grean belt. )   The Group also propose increased use of partnership schemes between local authoritiesand private enterprise - this would require legislation - and thepayment by developers of a share of the cost of the provision of essential services by local authorities.C. Land Hoarding Charge.     The intention that there shouldbe a land hoarding charge has already been announced by the Chancellorof the Exchequer in his Budget Statement.    It is proposed that theWhite Paper should give further details of how it will operate.    to counteract the danger that there may be hoarding of land on which planning permission has not been obtained, the White Paper willindicate the compulsory powers which are available and will makeplain that the Government will encourage local authorities to use them.A point for decision is whether the charge should be deductible for tax purposes.    The majority view was that it should not.D. Expansion of the Role of the Voluntary Housing Movement.It is intended that the Housing Corporation and the National BuildingAgency should be reorganised and strengthened and given the meanssubs-iantially to increase the scale of their support for the efforts of thehousing associations.E. Provision by Local Authorities.    The Government shouldcontinue to encourage local authorities to build for rent where necessary, to pursue energetically schemes for the clearance and early rebuilding of slums, and to eell council houses;  and should alsoencourage them to build specifically for sale.F. Improvement of Existing Houses.    New measures shouldbe worked out, and announced later this year, to facilitate the comprehensive improvement of older housing by a concentration of resources in stress areas.     The existing arrangements will, however,in practice have to be allowed to continue until mid-1974.FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS4. The Secretary of State for the Environment and the chief secretary, Treasury estimate that, excluding the cost of any measuresagreed in connection with mortgage stabilisation, the additional net cost of the proposals described in the White Paper will be:-  million1973-74     1974-75     1975-76     1976-77     1977-7814 44 74 110 1203
The Secretary of State has undertaken to find these sums - the major part of which would be required for expanding the role of the voluntary-housing movement - from within his Departments existing PESCallocations, largely by reductions in expenditure on Roads and miscellaneous Local Services; ard he recognises that these reductionsdo not obviate the question of a contribution over the whole range ofhis Departments programmes to the reductions in public expenditure as a whole which the Government have made their objective.Corresponding savings will be found by the Secretaries of State iorScotland and for Wales.    There has not yet been time to itemise precise Isavings but they will be worked out in time to be reflected in the 1973report of the Public Expenditure Survey Committee.    The Secretaries of state have however circulated separately a memorandum indicatingmore clearly the general nature, scale and effects of the necessaryreductions.FORM OF WHITE paper . The White Paper describes some of the proposals only ingeneral terms, leaving the details to be worked out subsequently followingconsultations with local authorities and the building industry.    This isnot ideal, but in the time available it has not been possible to takematters further.    I believe however that the policier described will prove attractive, and in particular that the increased priority proposed for housing will be welcomed by the public and is fully justified on bothsocial and political grounds.conclusion.        Subject to the views of the Cabinet on the proposals outlined inthis memorandum, the Secretaries of State for the Environment andfor Scotland will circulate draft White Papers for consideration atthe next meeting.R home Office30 March 1973
