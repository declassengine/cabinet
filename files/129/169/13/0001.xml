HS 146 aircraft memorandum by the Secretary of State for Trade and industry. The Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy at their meeting on21 March asked me to bring before Cabinet the request made last May byHawker Siddeley (HS) for launching aid for the HS 146 aircraft,    HS are nowentitled to a decision and have indicated that they are unable to continue the project without an assurance of Government support.    The Government ismeeting half the costs of keeping it alive for a limited time until a finaldecision is reached,THE HS 146 AIRCRAFT2.        Detaiio of the HS 146 aircraft, its economic prospects and theproposed launching aid terms are set out in Annex A.    HS have asked for a fixed Government contribution of  40 million (at 1972 prices and adjustedwith movements in the general price level).    The Committee was impressed by the commercial prospects of the aircraft and the fact that HS wereprepared to back, with a financial contribution of about half the estimateddevelopment costs, their judgment that it would be a commercial success.They also accepted that support for the project would fit in with our widerstrategy towards the aircraft industry, in which HS would play a key role,and that it would not conflict with other projects which might come forward.Had it not been for the implications of the project for the overall level ofpublic expenditure, the Committee would have been prepared to agree thatit should be supported on the terms proposed,PUBLIC EXPENDITURE CONSIDERATIONS3. There is no provision for the HS 146 in the present public expenditure forecasts.    As with all other new aircraft projects, it would become a claim on the contingency reserve.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury, hasrepresented strongly that he has been instructed by Cabinet to find savings in public expenditure of the order of  300 million to  350 million tore-establish the contingency reserve.    The HS 146 would require 40 million of additional Government expenditure including over  10 million in 1976-77,    If public expenditure is to be contained, new commitments mustnot be incurred if they can be avoided, and a commitment to the HS 146 canin his view be avoided.    He argues that other projects are being considered1CP(73) 53 COPY NO      639 April 1973CABINET
(see Annex B) which hold out greater prospects of European collaborationand cost sharing, and which would be an even bigger claim on the contingency reserve; we surely cannot afford both these and the HS 146.He suggests it is premature to finance major new projects until the futuresize and shape of the aircraft industry are clearer.GENERAL. AEROSPACE POLICY considerations .        I do not suggest that support for the aircraft industry shouldcontinue at its present 1973-74 level of  150 million; but. as the table in annex B shows, it will decline to  27 million in 1976-77 unless new projects are approved.    That would rapidly lead to a situation in whichwe ceased to have a significant civil aircraft industry capability.    Civildesign staff would fall from the present level of 4e 500 to about 2, 500 bythe mid-1970s - a too precipitate decline which would be difficult to check.The HS 146 is the only project which can be started quickly.EMPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS5. The HS 146 would provide some 5t 000 jobs over eight years in HS,Most of these would probably be at Hatfield.    In addition, some enginepodding work, involving perhaps 300 jobs, would be likely to go to Shortsin Belfast.INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS6, The Dutch Government have argued that there would be cut-throatcompetition between the KS 146 and the VFW/Fokker F23 and that thiswould make collaboration between HS and VFW/Fokker impossible formany years to come.    The German Government have just sent a supportingnote but in mild terms.    The two companies were asked to study the scope for co-operation on one aircraft or the other, but could not reach agreementWe have told the Dutch that, while we sympathise with their difficulties, wemust also consider the interests of our own industry.    The indications are that both the Dutch and German Governments would acquiescereluctantly in a decision to go ahead but that Fokker&apos;s reaction would besharp.    We would, however, need to present our decision with care and would work out with the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary how this can best be done.7. The French company Aerospatiale have also belatedly invited HSto collaborate on a feeder-liner of their own.    But this approach lookslike a spoiling tactic, is of no interest to HS and has received only tokensupport from the French Government.8. The proposed arrangements for the HS 146 might be challenged bythe European Commission under the provisions of the Treaty limiting Stateaids to industry (Articles 92 and 93),    To reduce this risk and to improve the presentation of our case I would be prepared to invite Hawkers to place an appropriate proportion of the work with another manufacturer within theCommunity.    I would also arrange that the Commission be given at leastten days1 notice of our intentions before any public announcement.2
conclusion.        I seek the Cabinet&apos;s agreement to offer HS a government contribution to the cost of launching the HS 146 on the basis set out at annex AB    The offer would be subject to the satisfactory outcome of a review of the financial strength of the HS group.    A public announcement would not be made until that review bad been completed.P w department of Trade and industry April 1973
ANNEX ATHE IIS 146, ITS ECONOMIC PROSPECTS AND THE TERMS FOR LAUNCHING and the  HS 146 Aircraft1       The HS 146 is a feeder airlinerfor 70-100 passengers, with a range of ahout 1000 miles-    It would be developed for service in1976/7 at an estimated cost of  80m (at January 1972 prices).       Themarket is uncertain - the aircraft would be sold in small numbers to small airlines over many years - but in my opinion it stands a good chance of commercial success (details of the economic assessment arein Appendix 1).   Most of the forecast sales would be abroad yieldingvaluable export earnings.2      The HS 146 would be powered by four American Lycoming engines.There is no European engine which is suitable and economic.    But anarrangement is being negotiated under which parts of the engineswould be manufactured under licence by Rolls Royce (1971)-The Terms for Launching Aid3       The Government would contribute  40m (at January 1972 prices and adjusted with movements in the general price level) towards thecost of developing the aircraft.   Hawkers have agreed to provide theremaining development finance and all the production finance, and tobear any cost overruns.    The Government would recover its contribution,by a levy on sales, at about the point when the project as a wholebreaks even.     These are terms more favourable than the Governmenthas obtained in any previous launching aid agreement.       If we decide in principle to go aliead now, I would make final approval dependent ona satisfactory outcome to a full enquiry, undertaken with a leadingfirm of accountants, into the financial strength of the hawker siddeley Group, in particular into its ability to withstand anyunexpected cost overruns.

annex BPROJECT 0P1OHTUNITIES AND PESO INDICATIONSA      Project OpportunitiesThe main opportunities for new projects which may arise in the next two of thee years are:-a      Commuter aircraft of about 30 seats.    The only possibility isthe Shorts SD3-30 which EPC considered on 14 March (EPC(73)3rd Mtg.Item 1 and EPC(73)13).b      Airliners of about 100 seats and 1,000 miles range costing about 80m to develop.   The HS 146 falls into this category,c      A medium range airliner to replace the B727 and Trident of about200 seats and 2,000 miles range.   This is the most important opportunityfor the next few years.   The main possibilities are:(i) The 7X7 Medium range Aircraft which Boeing plan to launchat the end of 1973 ior commissioning in 1977/8.   Total development costs about  250m.    Boeing are seeking European partners and wouldbe ready to co-operate with a consortium of European companies.This Boeing aircraft is likely to get the lion&apos;s share of themarket.(ii) A smaller version of the European A30OB using the RB211-24.Hawker Siddeley who are members of the existing project maymake proposals soon.   Additional development costs about  30m(assuming that the engine is developed for the Lockheed Tristar-2).But because the aircraft would not have originally been designed for this market, sales are estimated only at 50,
(iii)     A new European project - probably from the Europlaneconsortium of BAC, MBB, SAAB and the Spanish firm CASA.   Estimateddevelopment costs  250m.   Market very uncertain but most unlikely to exceed 300.   The companies plan to reach a preliminary viewby the end of April on whether to proceed or seek co-operationwith Boeing.   If they decide to proceed a final decision to launch would not be taken until April 1974- but they would seek a Government contribution towards the interim work,d   A smaller medium range airliner to replace the DC9 and BAC 1-11of about 150 seats and 1,500 miles range costing about  200m todevelop.   No clear possibilities have yet emerged.B   Rhancial Implications1   The latest estimate of actual expenditure on support for thecivil aircraft industry in 1972/3 is  140m of which over 90?y is on concorde and the BB211.   Expenditure on both these projects, on current estimates, continues at about this level, peaking in 197^-/5to  145m with a rapid reduction thereafter.   The Government areunusua lly meeting 100% of the development costs and a substantial part of the production costs.i. .....2   The level of support in the future will turn on individual projectdecisions which can only sensibly be taken when we have specific proposals and on the terms we can negotiate with the firms.   Inthe meantime any estimates can only be tentative.   The followingtable contains the best estimates we can make at present.

In the case of Concorde, increases in expenditure are likely but may possibly be partly offset by reductions on RB211.2      Current projects include expenditure for the Research andDemonstrator Programme as follows:-  million1972/3      1973/4      1974/5    1975/6      1976/7      1977/815.3 18.4 19.0        19.0 19.0 19.03      No provision has been included for possible expenditure on general support for RR(71) and Shorts.   This will depend on movements in the cash flow of the two companies whose amount and timing cannot3  million (at 1973 Survey Prices)1972/3   1973/4   197V5   1975/6   1976/7   1977/8
accurately be forecast more than a short time ahead.4      Expenditure on launching aid for the SD3-30, which will beborne on Northern Ireland PES allocations, is included at lines 3 and but is not included as a call on the Central Contingency Fund atline 8.5      New Engine Projects includes provision for a (new) 30,000 lbsthrust engine and for quietening the Olympus 593 engine for Concorde.6      It is assumed that the UK share of the 200 seater aircraft andthe 30,000 lb thrust engine will be 30% and that HMG will contribute75% of the UK share.7      No allowance is made for further new projects starting in the later years of the period but which cannot now be foreseen.    TheDC9/BAC1-11 replacement is regarded as falling in this category.4
