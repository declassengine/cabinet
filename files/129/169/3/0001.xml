CP(73) 43 COPY NO L j29 March 1973CABINETA MID-TERM POPULATION CENSUS IN 1976Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services. The Cabinet in their discussion of public expenditure on 15 Novemberasked for the proposal for a mid-term census of population in 1976 to bere-examined; and it was subsequently agreed that this examination shouldtake place in relation to the forthcoming report of the Population Panel.The report, which was published on 22 March, recommends that such a census should be undertaken, to provide a better knowledge of trends in population and internal migration, and of the causes and implications ofthese trends0 The Statistical Policy Committee at a meeting under my chairmanship on 21 March have accordingly reviewed the proposal.2. The census would cover the main demographic questions and anumber oi other key topics such as housing, employment and migration.In order to secure accurate statistics, particularly at the local level, the census would cover the whole population (the mid-term census in 1966covered a 10 per cent sample); but the questionnaire would be only about half the length of that used in the decennial census in 197L    It would cost 14. 8 million at 1973 prices.    The Committee agreed that there would beno benefit in holding a 10 per cent sample census again:  the cost would beat least half that of the full censub and the resulting information much lessuseful, particularly in the vital area of population migration.3. Most members of the Committee strongly support the need to hold amid-term census in 1976 in order to provide a better statistical basis for a wide range of both central and local government activities, and for the efficient allocation of very large sums of public expenditure - perhaps asmuch as  4, 000 million a year - which depend on an accurate knowledge ofthe structure and geographical distribution of the population: particularlyhousing, town planning, and regional employment.    There are also somesensitive political issues for whose handling the up to date informationprovided by a census in 1976 would be of great benefit&apos; the distribution andemployment of immigrants; housing tenure; the employment of highlyqualified manpower; and trends in mobility.    (In the field of education,however, the Secretary of State for Education and Science has access tocomprehensive annual statistics of school attendance etc and does not1
consider that a mid-term census is necessary for her purposes).    Localauthorities have also pressed strongly for a mid-term census; without onethe new authorities will have to base their policies on 1971 data until 1982or 1983,    Some Departments and local authorities may indeed find itnecessary to make room in their programmes for other surveys if the census is not taken in 1976.    It is also relevant that the French and federal german Governments have both decided to hold five-yearly censuses in1975-76:  accurate information on regional employment and migrantworkers could help us to secure a greater share of European Communityfunds.4. Other political considerations apart, the main difficulty about theproposed census is its cost of  15 million, for which no provision has beenmade in the Government&apos;s public expenditure plans.    Although the censuswould be a common service, none of the Departments which favour it asconsumers has offered to make any offsetting savings in areas of lowerpriority.    On the other hand, in accordance with the Cabinet&apos;s decision on30 January^ Departments are being asked to find savings from theirexisting programmes in order to re-establish a contingency reserve.    Atthe meeting of the Statistical Policy Committee, the Financial Secretary tothe Treasury expressed the view, in the foregoing light, that this was notthe time to authorise this new item of expenditure.5. Some of my colleagues have also expressed disquiet about thepossible public reaction to a further census in 1976.    Such evidence as wehave suggests that the publicity given to objectors to the 1971 census wasdispioportionate.    Most of the enumerators found that the general attitudeof householders to the census v/as helpful, only a few of them that it hadbeen obstructive;  and experience with a full-scale &quot;linking&quot; survey lastyear was similar.    A shorter questionnaire and an effective public relationscampaign would probably do much to obviate public objection.6. The Committee were told that if a census is to be held in 1976,detailed planning needs to begin now leading up to a large-scale pilot surveyearly in 1974.    A decision now to go ahead would mean adding the  15 millioncost of the census to the Governments existing expenditure plans, and hence raises questions concerning overall expenditure priorities.    In thelight of the considerations I have outlined, I invite the Cabinet to decide whether the census should be held.K department of Health and Social Security29 March 19732
