CP(73) 50 COPY NO    gg3 April 197 3CABINETHOUSING policy note by the Secretary of State for the EnvironmentAs requested by the Cabinet I am circulating the draft White paper on Housing policy  which has been approved by the Ministerial group on land and house prices.    The Group have suggested a few minor amendments which will be incorporated before the White Paper is published.    The draft has been prepared on the basis of the proposals set out in the memorandum recently circulated by thf Home Secretary(CP(73) 46), and may require further amendment in the light of decisions to be taken by the Cabinet at their meeting today.G r department of the Environment3 April 1973
(confidential)WIDENING THE CHOICE - HOUSING POLICY IN THE 1970&apos;sI     THE AIMS OP HOUSING policy.     The ultimate aim of housing policy is that everyone shouldhave a reasonable choice of owning or renting the sort of housethey want.    This country should now be able to go a long way towards achieving this social aim, and increasingly the test ofour success v/ill be the range of choice which we are able to give to every household.    There are still many people who have nochoice at all, including in particular the homeless.    Others -and they are still too many - have to put up with bad orexcessively expensive accommodation.    Even among those who live in reasonable conditions - and they are now the majority - thereare many who wish to own their home but cannot do so.    many others who prefer to rent can look only to one landlord - their local authority.2.     The Government&apos;s immediate objective is to continue the drive for more and better homes and to widen the range of choicefor all.    To secure this, we need a level of housebuilding,improvement and slum clearance sufficient to cope both with theannual increase in households, and the shortage of decentdwellings in many areas.    The new houses must be built in those parts of the country where good accommodation is scarce, and the proportions built to rent or buy must reflect the needs and wishes of the people in the area, and tne prices they can afford.    Thebuilding of new houses must be accompanied by a sustained effort to bring the existing stock up to a good standard and to eliminate slums.(confidential)
(CONFIDENTIAL)3.      This will require a flexible approach because the housingsituation varies widely between different areas.    The incidenceand pattern of new building, slum clearance and improvement mustrespond to the needs in each locality.    All these activities are required to create more choice in housing.THE NEXT STEPSSince 1970 the Government has established a national rent rebate and allowance scheme to assist both public and private tenants.    At the same time it has introduced a national systemof fair rents to remove the distortions and unfairness of thepast.    The Government has also given extra help to those authorities which have the worst slum clearance problems andthe latest assessments by local authorities give solid grounds for confidence that virtually all the remaining slums in existing and potential clearance areas in England and Walescan be dealt with by 1982.   At the same time the Government haslaunched a massive improvement drive which has more than doubledthe number of improved houses, in England and Wales there were319,000 improvement grants in 1972 compared with 157,000 in 1970.5.      It is now time to build on what has already been achieved.The Government has therefore decided on further steps to meetsocial needs by widening the choice in housing.a)     The Government has decided *-o create new opportunities for home ownership by measures designed to secure a high and stable output of houses to buy.    For this purpose it intends to maintain an adequate flow of mortgage funds, to increasethe supply of building land, and to encourage local authoritiesto build lower priced houses for sale and to sell existing houses.        ^_ . _
(CONFIDENTIAL)b) The Government will encourage local authorities and new townsto build for rent in areas where this is needed.c) The Government will expand the role of the voluntary housingmovement as a provider of rented housing, particularly where the decline of the private rented sector has createdsevere problems.    To assist in this the Housing corporation and the National Building Agency are being strengthened andwill work more closely together.d) The Government will encourage local authorities to press on with slum clearance and intends to concentrate futureassistance for improvement in the areas of greatest need.e) The Government will encourage local authorities to takea wider view of their functions in meeting all the physical and social aspects of housing need in their areas.II     HOME OWNERSHIP6.     Most people want to own their home.    Their housing problemsare best solved when they can exercise that choice.    Many people who had no previous hope of home ownership now aspire towards it.The latent demand for owner occupation was stimulated by themeasures which the Government took when it assumed office.    Atthat time the level of private housebuilding was depressed.The Government&apos;s measures led to an expansion of activity.Housing starts in the private sector rose from 165,000 in 1970 to227,000 in 1972.    In the last 2 years the number of owner occupieddwellings has increased by some 500,000.     But the supply ofhouses to buy has not yet caught up with the increase in demand.The measures outlined in Sections II and III of this White Paper
(CONFIDENTIAL)are intended to bring supply and demand into balance and to prevent a recurrence of the sharp increase in house prices resulting fromtheir imbalance.7.     The Government believes that the demand for nev; houses will need to be net mainly by private building for sale.    It regardsa high and sustained level of house building for sale as a primeobjective of housing policy.    This will require an adequate supply of mortgage funds and land.8.      The country has been fortunate to have the benefit of astrong and active building society movement.    Building societiesdo not operate for profit.    They serve the interests of their members, and of those who may one day become their members.    Butthey operate under commercial conditions.    The funds which theysupply are the life blood of the housing market.    Variations incredit conditions, which affect their ability to lend and therates which they are obliged to charge their mortgagors, have ledto periodic fluctuations in the output of new houses andconsequently in their price.    These cyclical movements have prevented the housebuilding industry from working to capacity and increasing its scope and efficiency.    In times of mortgagefamine builders have cut back output.    In times of mortgage glutthey have been slow to increase output for fear of the nextfamine, with the result that buoyant demand and plentifulfinance have forced up house prices.
9.     The Government does not believe that housebuilders and housepurchasers can be wholly insulated against changes in interest rates which affect the economy as a whole.    But it does consider that such changes should be neither too sharp, nor too extreme.    Periodicslumps in the output of new houses to buy would not be consistent with the Government&apos;s policy of sustained economic expansion.    TheGovernment has begun consultations with the building societies aboutthe creation of permanent arrangements to secure stability in the flow of mortgage funds.10.     Such arrangements will inevitably take time to introduce.Meanwhile the Government is determined to ensure that mortgage funds are adequate to support the level of housebuilding of which theindustry is capable.    /THE REMAINDER OF THIS PARAGRAPH WILL be drafted IN THE LIGHT OF THE CABINET DECISION ON POSSIBLE SHORT term measures?CONFIDENTIAL
More land for housebuilding.11.    Shortly after taking office, the Government asked localauthorities to release more land for private housebuilding.    Lastyear the Government asked local planning authorities to give moreplanning permissions for housing and to identify amounts of housingland which would suffice for their area&apos;s housebuilding needs for at least the next 5 years.   Authorities in the main pressure areas were allowed to borrox^ an additional  3 On in the next 2 years inorder to assemble and service land for development by private house-builders.    The Government also made it clear that it is prepared,where necessary, to support proposals from local authorities forthe compulsory purchase of land which is ripe for housing.12.    The results cf these measures have been encouraging.    Over a third of local planning authorities in England ana Vales have now puSLishedetails of land available for housing in their areas, and discussions have begun with builders and local authorities on the implicationscf this information.    The details so far published for the SouthEast suggest that, outside London, there is no serious general shortage of land within the region, but that there is still not enough land available in particular parts of it, mainly in the outer Metropolitan Area.    In the South East planning permission wasgiven for an estimated total of 59,000 private dwellings in theifirst three quarters of 1972 compared with 37,000 in the first three quarters cf 1970.New Planning Guidelines for Housing.13.    The Government believes that the release of land for housing needs to be further accelerated.    It will accordingly issue newguidelines for the treatment of planning applications.    The guidelineswill contain a general presumption in favour of housing development.Land which is shown in a development plan as not liable to a major change of use will no longer necessarily carry with it a presumptionagainst housing development.    The guidelines will contain a strongpresumption in favour of housing in growth areas approved by theGovernment in regional strategic plans.    This presumption would beoverridden only if there were exceptionally compelling planning objectionsDevelopment on land situated  in an approved Green Belt, a National
Park or an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, or on land of highagricultural or landscape value, will continue to be strictlycontrolled, and there will be no encouragement of sporadic orribbon development in the open countryside.      outside growth areasnatural extensions of existing towns or villages, particularlysmall extensions, would also be allowed except where there arc com-pelling planning objections of a kind which will bo set out in theguidelines.     The guidelines will shortly be promulgated in detailafter consultation with tiie local authority associations.      Appeals-to the Secretary of State on refusals to grant planning permission for housing will be judged on the basis of the guidelines.lk--    The Government believes that the basic purpose of Green Belts -to contain urban spreavl - must be a first priority, even when tiieneed to release more land for housing is acute.     This principle hasbeen re-affirmed by the recent extension of the approvedMetropolitan Belt by another . 7D.000 seres       of high amenity land to a new total of.  over o&quot;10,000 acres. -- -15 .    But it is essential that land preserved as Green Belt shouldfulfil another important Green Belt function:    to enhance theamenity of the whole area.      Studies will be undertaken to make thebest use of approved and proposed Green Belt.      But, as was pointedout in the report of the Fanei on the Greater London development plan, further study of London&apos;s land use requirements may need toembrace alternative uses of land in the Metropolitan Green Belt ifthaland   -contributes little to Green Belt purposes.     The Governmentaccepts aagrees withthis vicwi and/tiie associated proposal for/study by localauthorities of the uses to which land in the Green Belt fringesis being out&quot;.
(CONFIDENTIAL)16.    The Government considers, as did the GLOP Panel, that therearc limited areas of Green ^elt land where development could startused for housing without damage to basic Green 3elt policies, and indeed to their advantage.     Such areas could be identified bycareful examination by those best qualified for the job, the localauthorities.     The Government is therefore asking the StandingConference on London and South ilast Regional Planning, with theauthorities concerned, to undertake this task urgently.      From these areas the Government is looking for    some    2,000 acres, to be madeavailable quickly, which might after going through the normalplanning procedures be found suitable for housing.    &quot;These releasesof Green Belt land will be matched by extensions or improvementselsewhere.    In the light of the studies referred to in para 15*local authorities will be encouraged to propose additions to GreenBelt areas in their development plans.    They will also be givenencouragement and advice on ways&quot; of enhancing that amenity of GreenBelt land&quot; .i 17.    If housing land is developed at very low densities, it may become necessary to reiease for housing a needlessly large amountof land which is well suited to its existing use.     Minimum densityrequirements on land released for housing can therefore benefit the planning of the area.     They also enable builders to providelower-priced houses.     The Government does not favour very highdensities.      But it      will        support planning authorities whofix reasonable minimum densities.      in dealing with appeals theSecretary of State will be sympathetic towards proposals fordensities above cue low levels commonly used at present, if theseprovide a good environment^&apos; &apos;quickly because services are readily available andwhich could be
(CONFIDENTIAL)Government and other Public Land.18.   Most of the land held by the Government, the nationalised industries and hospital authorities is either in areas wherehousing land is readily available or is itself unsuitable for housing.     But the disposal of such land eg the 7,U00 acresreleased by Government departments during 1972, often bringsdirect or indirect benefits for housing.     Some 260 acres of surplus British Rail land in London have recently been foundsuitable for housing and British Rail are discussing with thelocal authorities concerned the possibility of releasing land in.other big cities.     The National Coal Board, in a joint studywith the local authorities, has identified some 1,350.
acres of surplus land in Staffordshire which might.be developed for housing.    Similar studies are now being undertaken orconsidered in other counties.    The Government will continue to pursue the release of surplus land with all nationalised industries with substantial land holdings .1.9.    In certain pressure areas the release of land no longer required by the National Health Service could provide a useful addition to the stock of housing land.    regional hospital Boards have .now been given an incentive to sell land.From 1973/7^1- onwards their capitalallocations will be supplemented by the proceeds of landsales within their areas.- *Building for Sale by Local Housing Authorities2 0.   Housing authorities can help to increase the supply ofhouses for owner occupation by promoting, on land which they themselves own, the building of houses for sale to meet thelocal need for lower priced houses which is not fullysatisfied by developers.    The Government is asking   authoritiesto&quot; come forward with schemes designed for this purpose andto    make use of the permitted discounts from unrestrictedmarket value.    Such schemes will readily be approved.    Inthe Government&apos;s view, they should be carried cut on behalfof the authority by private builders to designs and standardsappropriate to the owner-occupied sector.
i theLocal Authority/Private Enterprise Partnership Schemes22.    Last year a Working Party comprising representatives of local planning authorities, landowners, hoiisebuilders and the Departmentof the Environment examined the scope for new forms of partnership between local authorities and private enterprise in undertaking large-scale residential development in the South East of England.    TheWorking Party found that partnership schemes between local authoritiesand private interests could greatly facilitate the assembly of land and its subsequent comprehensive development, and recommended early legislation to enable all local authorities to form joint companies with developers and landowners.    The Government has accepted thisrecommendation and will introduce the necessary legislation at anearly opportunity.21.    Housing authorities can also usefully contribute to the promotion of home ownership by being ready to sell council houses to theiroccupants.    Many council tenants wish to become owners of the house in which they have made their home.    The Government has repeatedlyrequested authorities to give tenants this opportunity.    Many councilshave not responded to this request, usually on the grounds that saleswould reduce the stock of rented accommodation available to those on thcouncil&apos;s waiting list.    Such reasoning is unrealistic since the tenantis not normally prepared to live elsewhere.    Nor is it reasonable for a housing authority thus to put pressure on its tenants to leave their homes.    The Government is convinced that the sale of council houses to existing tenants is an important part of any local authority housing policy which is designed to give wider choice. TheGovernment hopes that those authorities who are not now prepared to seltheir existing houses will reconsider this policy so as no longer to frustrate th^ir tenants&apos; legitimate aspirations to home ovmership.
CONFIDENTIALContributions by Developers23.    Housing development is frequently held up because the public authorities responsible for providing essential services cannotreadily finance then as quickly as the developer would wish.The prospect of heavy expenditure on ancillary services oftenmakes local authorities reluctant to give planning permission for housing on land which is otherwise ripe for development.Thin difficulty can be met by an agreement under section $2 ofthe Town mcl Country Planning Act 197&apos;&apos; between the authority and the developer under which the latter agrees to contribute towards the provision of the services made necessary by thedevelopment.   Authorities are, however, generally reluctant tomake such agreements, as these can be evaded where the authoritydoes not have local Act powers to bind successors in title tothe positive covenant involved.    The Government has accepted therecommendation of the Working Party referred to in the previous paragraph and will introduce early legislation empowering all local&apos; authorities to make agreements with developers undersection $2 binding on successors in title.21\.\.  The Government believes that we should now apply more widely theprinciple   which underlies such agreements andthat the developer should be required to pay for those publiclyprovided services which make the development feasible..The Government, is    thereforeconsulting the local authority associations and thehousebuilding industry about provisions, to be included in early legislation, which will require developers to contribute towardsthe cost of services provided by public authorities in connectionwith the development of land with planning permission.
III     THE LAND HOARDING CHAUGE25.     The Government&apos;s measures to secure more planningpermissions for housing development v:ill go a long way to remedy the shortage of building land and so remove theoccasion for windfall profits based on scarcity values.     Butthey will be frustrated if land speculators can with impunitycontinue to hoard land with planning permission.     Manypermissions are not being implemented.      In the South East ofEngland (outside London) permissions for new private cU;ellingssubstantially exceeded the number started in every quarter sincethe third quarter of 1&apos;97*0.      In the year ending JO September 197*planning permissions were given for an estimated 7^*000 suchdwellings, but only 52,000 were started.26.      The Government has therefore decided, a.:;&apos;the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer announced in his Budget statement, to promoteearly legislation to introduce a land hoarding charge.      Thepurpose of this charge is to ensure that land with planning permission for housing is developed promptly,  and to penaliseThe following paragraphs set outthe speculative hoarding of such land./ the  main outlines ofthe charge, about which the Government will now hold urgentconsultations with the local authority associations and thehousebuilding industry.27       The charge will be levied for failure to complete developmentwithin a specified period from the grant of planning permission. .Legislation will prescribe a normal completion period of l\. years from the grant of outline permission     or 3 years from the grantpf full permission where, no outline application was madeCOU FIDENT1AL
in the -first-instance. Local planning authorities will heempowered to authorise longer completion periods on applicationv/here this seems reasonable in the light of the particular circumstances;    the legislation will set out the kinds of considerations to which authorities may have regard.     These will include the size of the development, its relationship to programmes for services, and the general state of the housing market.Authorities will also be empowered to extend the periodif this is justified by any change in circumstances..in particular those outside the developer * s control, including any -delay in aporoval of detailed blens following a grant of outline[permission,28.&apos;    Where land is already subject to planning permission- onthe date of this White Paper, thye normal completion period vill.\f. the, permission is in outline only., and 3 years from that datebe q. years from that date / where detailed plans havealready been approved or detailed permission already exists.this in considering applications for extending the period, local planning authorities will be required to have regard to any time that hais...elapsed between the grant of permission and the date ofthe White Paper.29.      The charge will be levied on the full market value of thewidch the relevantproperty[on the day after/planning permission is grantedjor, inthe case of land with - permission granted before the date&amp;he ,     1 -1of the White Paper, the value on &apos;.       date/.of *Mkih^oI^^Tbeassessed by the District Valuer,  subject to appeal to the lands tribunal.      The charge will accrue from the end of the completionperiod by reference to a fixed percentage of that value for eachyear&apos;s delay, the charge to be levied for the actual year of
completion being based on the proportion of that year whichhas elapsed before completion.     The charge will be due andpayable for the first tine either on the date of completion oron the expiry of a year from the end of the competion period,whichever is the earlier, and on the same day in each subsequentyear during which the delay continues until the completion date.Interest will be payable for any period of delay in payment afterthe due date.30.     The Government1s present intention is that the charge shouldbe at a rate of jJ-Ojf/for -each full year of delay.     A finaldecision on the rate will be taken in the light of the circumstancprevailing when the legislation is introduced.     But, on the basisof an annual rate of[20;.Q a person who had three years in which to complete development and was allowed no extension of the period would become liable to the charge if, on the first day of thefourth year,  the development was incomplete.       The amount of thecharge would increase day by day &quot;until at the end of the fourthyear it would bejj20$iJlof the value at the beginning of the first year, at the end of the fifth year it would bejj^O^jof that value and so on.      Where part of the land is completely developed, thecharge would apply only to so much of the site as had not been completely developed.31. The charge will not be deductible for tax &quot;pur-poses ie it -will not be treated either as a trading expense for builders anddevelopers, or as an addition-to cost, for those liable to&apos;capital gains tax. ^ . ... -----
32s     The charge will be computed ;on the basis of the District Valuer&apos;s valuation.i stcs&apos;-.&quot;       The charge will be collected by the Inland Revenue end paid into the consolidate fund.33.     The charge will not apply to(1)    Cases where the planning permission is for theimprovement or conversion of an existing structure,whether or not this involves the creation of newdwellings, or for the extension of an existingstructure involving the creation of not more than two. dwellings.(2) Plots of land for which there is planning permissionon the date of this White Paper for the constructionof not more than two additional new dwellings.(3)   Land which is the subject of a mixed permission for housing and some other materially different form ofdevelopment,.if the local planning authority considersthat housing is not the predominant form of development.3li.    To prevent evasion the charge will be secured on the propertyitself.      Ordinarily the person chargeable will be the owner orthe holder of some other relevant interest in the property such asa long leaseholder.      To safeguard the position of owners of landwho are opposed to the development of their land, the existing planninglaw will be amended to provide that the -written consent of the ownerwill in general be necessary before an application for planning permission for housing could be valid.    If the owner witholdsC0WFID3ITTIAL
that consent, the local planning authority will be able to resort to proceedings for compulsory purchase with a view to reselling theland for development, just as it can now do where an owner isunwilling to seli land which is ripe for development.    The Secretaryof State will be ready to support compulsory purchase if the landis urgently needed for housing and is otherwise unlikely to be forthcoming ior this purpose in the immediate future./ Planning. permission obtained before the date of the .7hite Paper by a person other than the owner will not be exercisable if the owner canestablish that he had objected to the grant of the permission.      Inthat case no compensation wouid be payable.3 .   Every permission for housing development which might attract the charge will include a specified completion period, which would,normally, unless the local planning authority determined a longer period, be the one prescribed in the proposed legislation.     Thisspecified completion period will go with the planning permissionand be subject to the- right of appeal to the Secretary of State whowould determine it on the basis of the parties1 written renresent-ations.      Similarly,any application for an extension of a periodincorporated in an existing permission wouid also be subject to appeal to the Secretary of State.are36.   All planning permissions/now subject to time limits.       Thenormal ti.ao limit for starting to implement a permission is 5 years.A planning permission for housing existing on the date of the ..hitePaper which might attract the charge will remain valid for afurther period which will be specified in the he will also&apos;be ready, where necessary, to use his power to require a local planning authority to exercise its acquisition powers for the compulsory purchase of land which is ripe for housing development.
legislation unless the local planning authority considers thatthe permission should not remain valid.IV.    THE VOLUNTARY HOUSING MOVEMENT37.   Many people prefer to rent their home or cannot afford to buy it.   Theytoo must have an adequate choice of decent accommodation.But   for them the choice is becoming increasingly narrow.    Theprivate rented sector continues to decline.    The Government believes that the trend towards a municipal monopoly of rented accommodation-is unhealthy in itself.    It is particularly undesirable in areas of housing stress where the lack of houses to rent is puttingincreasing pressure on the remaining private accommodation, so thatsome private tenants in these areas have to endure the worst housing conditions in the country/NvThe Government will continue tosupport improvement of the quality of private rented dwellings.But the&apos; decline in their number is unlikely to be reversed.    TheGovernment therefore proposes to widen the range and choice ofrented accommodation by the expansion of the voluntary housingmovement.33.   Housing associations already do valuable work, particularly in areas of housing stress.    Because they do not operate for profit,they manage their properties in the interest of present and futuretenants.    Housing Associations provide an opportunity for people -not least those with special housing needs - who have failed to findaccommodation elsewhere, j The Government will strengthen.-the HQusingCorporation and provide it with additional funds so &quot;that it will play a leading role in promoting the expansion of &quot;voluntary housing.In this the Corporation will work closely with the National BuildingAgency.
lyf\      At present, the Mousing Corporation^ main function is topromote co-ownership sciiemes.     These provide a valuable choice between renting and owner occupation, and are now providing some10,000 new houses a year.     The mousing Corporation will be giventhe means to increase this total.     But the Corporations main newtask will be to support a great expansion of the dwellings to rentwhich the housing associations provide.     Under the mousing Finance/-ct 1972 the Corporation can now lend to all housing associations.The Government intends the Jorporation to make the fullest use of thiother possible sources of finance,new power and to explore/ The national hr.il hi ug agency was established to nrovide professional advice and to improve efficieacv in building.The experience which it has built up will be at the service of theCorporation and the voluntary housing movement.4&apos;:&apos;?.    As a first step, a single new Chairman for both the corporation and the Agency has been appointed.     he will review their functions and relationship to enable them to make the most effective contrib-contributions, to c.-e new initiatives proposed by the Government.      TheCorporation&apos;s new remit will be to promote the development and effectiveness of the voluntary housing movement as a whole.      TheCorporation will in particular help housing associations to be activewhere housing conditions are worst and housing needs are greatest.It will seek out housing land and support housing associations inits purchase.     It will promote similar opportunities for housing associations to pu-rehase existing houses and to convert and improvethem to a decent standard.V .      The Government believes that by its support of housing associations the Corporation will complement the efforts of localauthorities   to improve the variety and quality   of housing in their
areas, especially when the authority is tackling stress conditioor is seeking to improve the environment of residential areas.The Corporation will he ready to work closely with local author!in the pursuit of these common objectives.42* The Government believes that, with the heip of these ineasuthe voluntary housing movement can and should play an increasingbig part in eliminating the -worst housing conditions and wideninhousing caoice for everyone.
V     THE ROLE OF LOCAL authorities the social health of an area, and the quality of its builtenvironment, are largely determined by its housing.     TheGovernment therefore believes that local authorities should takea broad view of their statutory housing functions.)%Jr      The primary housing responsibilities of every local authority must continue to be the provision of rented houses to meet the needs oftheir area and the elimination of unfit or sub-standard accommodateIn certain areas there are still many families ivho wish to rentwho cannot find a rented dwelling suited to their needs.     In such areas it is the job of the local authority,   .vith the help of housing associations, to provide more houses to rent.     TheGovernment strongly supports those councils who get on with thatjob and has created the conditions which enable them to tackle it.this government has not restricted council building on capital investment grounds, I &quot;-. ..... .The subsidiesprovided by the Housing Finance Act allow authorities to build thehouses which they believe to be needed without thereby increasingthe rents of their tenants or olacing intolerable burdens on theirratepayers.     The housing cost yardstick system has recently beenmade more flexible so that local authorities are now proceeding witrtheir schemes at a cost which reflects local market conditions. TheGovernment will continue to review with local authorities and thebuilding industry the best means of ensuring that the housebuildingprogrammes of local authorities are promptly put into effect.In the Government&apos;s view, local authorities have a special responsibility for ensuring that adequate and suitable accommodation to rent is available to those who have special needsor suffer from special disadvantages.     The subsidies under theHousing Finance Act enable local authorities and housing association to discharge this responsibility. Even in areas where the general demandfor rented accommodation is being met, the local authority must
consider the needs of special groups - in particular the elderlyand the physically handicapped - for whom the provision so far madeis often inadequate.    The needs of the elderly/mi^e^g^eat and growingclaims on the rest of the community.    Already over 7 million people in Great Britain are 65 or over:    2iV million of them are 75&quot; or over.By 1931  there will be 8m people aged 65 or more and 3rn aged 75 ormore.    Many of them suffer from some handicap o  illness.    It mustbe an objective of housing policy that elderly people should, asfar as possible, be able to continue to live within the community.This will require an adequate supply of purpose-built accommodationwith suitable special facilities.    It is encouraging that the building programmes of local authorities and housing associations have over recent years included an increasing proportion cf one-bedroom dwellingsand other housing specially designed for the elderly.    But thecommunity will need to increase its efforts if this objective is tobe achieved.&apos;s6-    The most glaring of all special needs is honelessness.This evil must be eradicated.    Some homeiessness is the direct resultof personal problems - largely unrelated to housing - which canonly be cured by social measures which lie outside the scope of this white Paper.    But homelessness is also a reflection - and the mostdistressing one - of the shortage of rented accommodation in certain areas.    It cannot be wholly cured until the shortage is removed,and the government strongly supports the housebuilding programmes of local authorities and housing associations which are directed to this end.    But homeiessness can be alleviated.    There is scope for clarifying responsibilities within local government, so that both housing and social service authorities can help the homeless inthe most effective and humane way.    Moreover the Government helieves that,wherever there is homeiessness, there is a/case^fbr : making full use
of premises &apos; - ; . ..; acquired by Public authorities in the process of redeveXoymenin order to provide at least some temporary shelter in which familylife may be Maintained.     The Government is discussing- these possibilities with local authorities in London.     It will shortlyconcert with all local authorities a campaign to improve theconditions of the homeless and to reduce the incidence oC homeless-ness.h7.      Single persons, as well as families,   are victims of horne-Xessness and shortages    of suitable accommodation.     The housing finance Act has not sufficiently increased the financial supportavailable to those local authorities and voluntary organisationswho stand ready to provide hostels and similar accommodation formany classes of single person, particularly young and migrantworkers and those with low or intermittent earnings.     More and better accommodation of this kind is badly needed to deal with increasing homelessness aniotK single people.     The government intends to introduce early legislation to give additional help toorganisations providing such accommodation by contributing towardsthe deficits arising
from schemes for new building and modernisation.     Discussionswill shortly begin with representatives of these organisations.ilAU    In response to the Government1s request local authorities arcdrawing up 10 year strategics to discharge cor.iprchenc-ive.ly their responsibility for dealing with unfit and sub-standard housing. -The...use of slum clearance poT.;ers has become financially feasible inall situations as a result of tpp slum clearance subsidy introduced -titby the Housing Finance Act 1972./ Slum clearance will continue to be-important in the attack on our inheritance of bad housing.    But whole-sale demolition of residential areas displaces and uproots settledcommunities.     The alternative is systematic and thoroughimprovement of older housing, and the rehabilitation of wholeMany authorities are relying increasingly on this alternative andthe Government will sustain its support for this approach.But whether, or not a local authority has substantiallycompleted the primary tasks of building for rent, clearing slumsand promoting improvement, there are other housing tasks which,in the Government1s view, fall within its function.     TheGovernment believes that every authority should now be ready,  whernecessary, to supplement the activities of housing developers by building lower-priced houses for sale, and to widen the choice of .tenure in their areas by selling council houses to tenants who wish to buy them (sec paragraphs 20   and 21- above).      In additionhousing authorities should exercise their planning responsibilitieso as to assure an adequate supply of land for private housobuildihis subsidy   enables local authorities, at modest cost to.the ratepayers,o use cleared land, or to dispose of it, for whatever use they Judge best,he Government looks to authorities to ensure that cleared land is ....romptly put to its new use.
Finally, the Government believes that, with the help of the subsidies under the Mousing Finance Act which arc availablefor tiie maintenance and management of council housing, localauthorities should now further improve the condition and amenities of their estates, and with it the environment of muchof our towns and villages.5-&quot;&quot;.    A wide view of local authority housing responsibilities isparticularly necessary in considering those areas of stresswhere overcrowding and bad housing are worst.     These arc theareas where the housing stock is old and in poor condition and where the combination of acute physical and social problems makesaction most difficult. In many of these areas - for example certain parts of London and other great cities - the decline of the privaterented sector, and its relatively poor response to the incentivesof improvement grants, threaten to perpetuate poor housing conditions and to increase social deprivation.      Only a compre-hensive approach will succeed in curing the ills of these areas.At the same time these areas must be able to benefit to the fullest possible extent from the Government&apos;s improvement policies, -sothat help towards improvement reaches those people who are leastable to help themselves.      Following its review of older housing the Government will later t:is year bring forward proposals forspecial measures to deal comprehensively with the housing problemsof those areas suffering from the greatest degree of stress.These proposals will he integrated with the Government\s plans for expanding the voluntary housing movement and will he designedto assist local authorities to give effective priority to their most urgent housing or oh loins.
VI     CONCLUSION51.    The main policies set out in this White Paper can be summarisedas follows:-(1)    The Government is concerned to secure a flow of mortgage fundiwhich will be adequate to support a high and stable levelof private housebuilding.

It will issue new guidelines for planning applications and appeals containing a generalpresumption in favour of housing development unless thereare serious planning objections.(3)   A land hoarding charge will prevent speculative profits by those who fail to develop land with planning permission for housing.The Government proposes to expand the role of the voluntary housing movement as providers of houses to rentin pressure areas.    To this end the Housing Corporation andthe National Building Agency are being reorganised andredeployed.(5)    The Government supports building for rent, slum clearanceand improvement by local authorities wherever these arenecessary and looks to them to exercise their housingfunctions with a view to all the housing needs in their area.It expects them to sell existing houses and, where necessary,to build for sale.
