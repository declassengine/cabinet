RELOCATION OF DEFENCE FACILITIES FROM SHOEBURYNESSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for defence, I was invited by my colleagues in the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee to circulate a memorandum setting out the penalties in defenceterms that would be incurred if the Proof and Experimental Establishment(P &amp; EE) tasks planned for relocation at Tain were moved to West Freugh,and combined with the existing air weapons task.2. West Freugh is a Ministry of Defence air range of 2, 750 acres in western Scotland.    It is the prime location for the development and testing of air weapons and aircraft weapons systems and for tne operational training of RAF crews in their use.    Our future development andtraining programmes require a range large enough to accommodatea variety of targets with associated low flying approaches involvingterrain-following flying.    West Freugh is the only range in NATOEurope meeting there requirements and for this reason plans forMulti Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA) weapons system development and testing centre on its use.3. To locate at West Freugh the P &amp; EE facilities destined forTain (listed at Annex A) would require the purchase of some 1,500additional acres.    As the unique characteristics of West Freugh,which are essential to the air task, cannot be provided else wherein Europe, the possibility of co-locating the P &amp; EE and air tasksat West Freugh has been examined in detail.4, The completion of our current and future air tasks, includingMRCA development, will require maximum use of the West Freugh range and this will demand absolute priority for aircraft sorties whenever the weather is suitable.    In addition, the nature of modern low level weaponsrequires very extensive target preparation and weapon recovery for eachweapon released.    This involves long hours of work on the targets,entailing unrestricted access to the target complex (located on the fore-shore) whenever air weapon drops are not being carried out.    For safetyreasons P &amp; EE firing would not be possible either when aircraft were using the range or when men were working in the target area,.    Theproblem is examined in more detail in Annex B; this shows that, forSECRETCP(73) 49 COPY NO       g g2 April 1973CABINET
these and other reasons, the air and P &amp; EE tasks cannot be carried outsimultaneously and it follows that, even with maximum co-ordination,neither task could be completed.5.        The operational penalties would be most serious.    The planzieddevelopment of future air weapons and aircraft systems would be severelyhampered, if not stopped altogether, and this, combined with the loss of essential operational training facilities, would have a most adverse effecton the RAF&apos;s future operational capability.    Moreover, it would breachthe tri-national agreement made with our German and Italian partners inthe MRCA: failure to provide the promised facilities at West Freugh forthis project could well pi&apos;ace its future in jeopardy by degrading theaircraft&apos;s operational capability, increasing the length and the costof the development programme and delaying the in-ser\ice date - factors which could well make the MRCA unacceptable to the Air Forces and governments concerned.    Equally, the operational penalties for P &amp; EEare that our research and development of large calibre weapons andammunition v.ould be halted, together with the essential proof of fuzesand ammunition,6. Tn addition to the repercussions on collaborative projects (withall the attendant political difficulties that this would entail) and on the operational capability of our armed forcess the loss of significant defencedevelopment, testing and proving capabilities would inevitably result in increased reliance on foreign supply of arms, not to mention loss ofvaluable export sales.7. Even leaving aside these factors the use of West Freugh by P &amp; EEwould not in any case be possible without the acquisition of 1, 500 acres ofgood quality agricultural land; this would be opposed by the owners and agricultural interests.    The proximity of the gun positions and dangerareas to a nearby village, and the noise of gun firing, would pose additionalenvironmental problems.    Finally the Department of the Environmentcould not have free access to the range for construction work for theF &amp; EE facilities.    The complete evacuation from Shoeburyness wouldnot therefore be possible fcr six to seven years after the land became available.    The Department of the Environment estimate the cost of necessary work at West Freugh at  53 million and the cost of theacquisition of land is estimated at an additional  0. 75 million.8. My conclusion, therefore, on both operational and environmentalgrounds, together with the delay to the evacuation of Shoeburyness, is thatjoint air and P &amp; EE use of West Freugh cannot be regarded as a realistic solution to the problem of relocating the P &amp; EE.SECRETMinistry of defence April 1973

(secret)Annex P,INCOMPATIBILITY OF AIR AND P &amp; EE TASKS AT WEST FREUGH1 .     The development, testing and training programmes i*or modernair weapons systems require a range complex possessing thefollowing facilities:a. low flying routes in an area of low population,over varying terrain with undulating, unobstructedcountryside at least 20 miles long terminatingin an instrumented live weapons range;b. a target area large enough to accommodate a variety of complex targets and suitable forweapon release heights as low as 80 feet aboveground level and at speeds up to 0.9 Mach;c. a safety area around the targets suitable for thedevelopment of target acquisition systems includinglasers.West Freugh is the only air weapons range in Western europe which possesses all these facilities and for this reason mxistbe used for certain future programmes including the MRGA.2.     Tasks for which West Freugh is essential are shown at appendix A together with a breakdown of the flying required to achieve them.    Amongst these is the development of the MRCA andthe sophisticated low level weapons which have the highest priority for conventional weapons for the RAF and also consider-able export potential.   The Appendix shows that post-1 l\S0 some1100 flying hours on range will be required per annum.    Forthat West Freugh will be open for flying for much more than1100 hours.    It follows that in order to complete the difficult and complex programmes which make up the West Freugh task, itis essential for aircraft to use the range whenever weather conditions are suitable.3.     A high proportion of the weapon releases for which WestFreugh is essential will involve BL 755, AST 1217 and AST 1225(brief details of these weapons are given in Appendix B).   Thenature of these weapons which disperse lethal bomblets willrequire an average of 55 hours for each weapon drop for targetpreparation and clearance.    It is estimated that there will be2v;0 live weapon drops per annum.   The P &amp; EE tasks cannot becarried out at the same time because of safety considerations.h.     The facilities, associated with the P &amp; RE which would be located at West Freugh,are given at Appendix C.    Even with aland take of 1500 acres overlapping between the air task and pr &amp; EE task will be inevitable.    The purchase of additional land would not ease thi3 problem because of the limited seafrontage, and villages would come into the danger area.various reasons it is un1ikelyA-1(secret)
(secret)Individually the P &amp; EE tasks will take about 3,500 hours per year.   However, more than one facility can be used at the sametime and although this will reduce, to some extent, the totaltime taken, it is clear that there is insufficient time in theyear to complete the air and P &amp; EE task.5.     Certain P &amp; EE facilities would fire across the airfield and across the RAF targets.    This would create obvious problems for aircraft wanting to use the airfield and would mean thatthe airfield buildings would probably have to be situated wellaway from the runway and more land would have to be taken.   Oneof the P &amp; EE facilities requires two 250 feet high non-metallictowers on the foreshore.   They would be near the flight pathof the low level contour run, and aircraft fly down to a height of 80 ft and travel at speeds of up to 0,9 mach.    The site doesnot permit the towers to be positioned in such a way as toneutralise  the hazards they present to aircraft.6.     No assessment of the use of the ran^e which may be requiredby the FRG Air Force or the Italian Air Force for MRCA training has been made.    It is clear however,  that both will seek time on the range because they cannot provide similar facilities.   no allowance has been made for weapon drops by foreign air forces,but the Germans, for example, have placed an order for 3L 755at a value of  25M and they will almost certainly want to use the West Freugh range for testing.   The implication is that theair task set out in Appendix A is likely to increase.A-2(secret)

(secret)Appendix B to Annex 3Notes on weapons BL 755, AST 1217 and AST 1225BL 7551.      BL 755 is a cluster munition designed for delivery at high speed and low level against tanks and other battlefieldtargets.    The weapon is in full production for the Royal AirForce with a parallel  25M production of 8.U30 stores for theGerman Air Force.    A Belgian order for 280 weapons worth  1Mand a Dutch order for 735 weapons worth  2.56?* have also beenplaced.    Tentative orders from Canada for 850 weapons ( hM)and Italy 600 weapons ( 2!.:) are under negotiation.2.     Further R&amp;D trials are anticipated until the end of the decade and proofing and training drops will continue well beyond that.AST 1217 - Airfield Denial3.     This calls for a weapon to neutralise airfields bycratering take-off and landing areas and taxi-tracks.    the weapons will be carried in a dispenser and are designedprimariljr for carriage by the MRCA but will also be used on other in-Service aircraft.AS? 1225h.      AST 1225 calls for an area denial weapon complementary toAS&apos;n 1217.    Its purpose is to deny access to airfield areasdamaged by AST 1217.    Its form will be a dispenser containingsub-munitions v/ith an anti-vehicle/anti-personnel capability.Sub-munition characteristics will include random time and anti-disturbance fuzing.A-k(secret)
