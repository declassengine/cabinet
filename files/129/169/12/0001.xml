1. I am circulating for information the text of the White paper which, subject to any final drafting changes, I propose to publish withthe forthcoming Uprating Bill (probably in the week beginning16 April).2. The White Papei details the proposed higher rates of social security benefits and contributions, and gives a factual account of theother changes which were outlined in my statement to the House on7 March.    It will be accompanied by the usual Report by the government actuary on the Financial Provisions of the 3ill.3. The main increases of benefits and contributions were authorised by the Cabinet in its endorsement of the Chancellors Budget proposals.The changes in the minor rates were consequential and broadlyproportionate and were settled with the Treasury.    The proposal for afurther change in the Family Income Supplement was cleared by theHome and Social Affairs Committee.K department of Health and Social Security4 April 1973CP(73) 52 COPY NO      684 April 1973CABINETTHE 1973 REVIEW OF SOCIAL SECURITY benefits and ASSOCIATED CHANGES: DRAFT WHITE paper note by the Secretary of State for Social Services
THE 1973 REVIEW OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS AND ASSOCIATED CHANGESPART I.     introduction.    The Government are today introducing a Bill to give effect to the increases in national insurance, industrial injuries and supplementary benefits announcedlast month;   parallel improvements in war pensions will also be provided underappropriate instruments.    The increases in benefits and the increases in contributionsrequired to finance them will take effect from the week beginning 1 October.2.    Retirement and invalidity pensions, widows&apos; benefits and other long-term benefits will be increased by larger amounts than the short-term benefits -unemployment benefit, sickness benefit, injury benefit and maternity allowance.In addition to the general increase the Government&apos;s proposals include three selectiveimprovements which will benefit mainly the sick, the old and low income families.The invalidity allowance, which was introduced in the National Insurance Act 1971and which is paid with invalidity pension or unemployability supplement, is to be substantially increased.    A second change concerns the special heating needs of old people and others receiving supplementary benefit.    As from 1 October allamounts awarded by the Supplementary Benefits Commission for extra heating will bepaid on top of the new rates of supplementary benefit instead of being offsetagainst the long-term addition.     Thirdly, family income supplement income levelswill be raised by 50p a week for families with up to four children, and there willbe higher increases, in steps of 50p, for families with five or more children.The maximum weekly benefit will be increased from  5 to  6 for families with three or more children.3.     To help finance the higher national insurance benefits graduated contributions will go up.     The flat-rate contributions of employed persons will be reduced but the employer&apos;s share of those contributions will be increased.     Flat-rate contributions for the self-employed and non-employed will also be raised.1
PART IINATIONAL INSURANCE benefits the benefit increases4.    The standard weekly rates of flat-rate unemployment and sickness benefit willbe increased from  6.75 to  7.35 for a single person and from  10.90 to  11.90for a married couple.    Maternity allowance will also be increased from  6.75 to 7.35.    Dependency increases for children payable with these benefits will beincreased from  2.10 to  2.30 for the first child with corresponding smaller amountsfor other children for whom family allowances are normally payable.5.    The standard weekly rates of flat-rate retirement, invalidity and widows&apos;pension will be increased from  6.75 to  7.75 for a single person and from  10.90to  12.50 for a married couple.    The children of widows and of invalidity andretirement pensioners attract a specially high rate, at present  3.30 (includingfamily allowances where these are payable) and this will go up to  3.80.     the weekly rate of guardian&apos;s allowance and child&apos;s special allowance will also beraised from  3.30 to  3.80.6.    The weekly rate of old person&apos;s pension payable under the provisions of the1970 and 1971 National Insurance Acts will be increased from  4.05 to  4.65.     the weekly rate for a married woman, at present  2.50, will go up to  2.85.7. The weekly rates of widow&apos;s basic pension and contributory old age pension payable to certain widows under the former Contributory Pensions Acts are to beincreased from  2.03 to  2.33.8.     Rates of invalidity allowance will go up proportionately more than other benefits.     The increases are of 40 per cent - the highest rate of  1.15 is increasedto  1.60 and the two lower rates of 70p and 35p go up to  1 and 50p respectively.9.     Attendance allowance at the day and night rate will go up from  5.40 to  6.20.Jand the day or night rate which first becomes payable in June at the rate of  3.60will go up to  4.15.10.   Details of the existing and proposed new rates of retirement pension and other national insurance benefits are given in Appendix I.     Corresponding improvementswill be made in pensions and benefits payable at less than the standard rates.Earnings-related supplement11.   The upper limit   on the band of weekly earnings on which earnings-relatedsupplement is to be paid at 15 per cent will be increased from  48 to  54 in line
with the new upper limit for graduated contributions (see paragraph 24).    Thissupplement i s paid with flat-rate benefit during the first six months of unemploy-:r.ent, sickness or widowhood.     The new limit will take effect in the assessor &apos;of supplements based on earnings in the 1974/75 income tax   year.PART IIIINDUSTRIAL INJURIES12.   The weekly rates of injury benefit will be increased from  9.50 to  10.10for a single person and from  13.65 to  14.65 for a marr;&apos;.ed couple.     The pension for an assessment of 100 per cent disablement will be increased from  11.20 toC12.80, with proportionate increases in the rates for lo?/er assessments.    Themaximum gratuity (for assessment below 20 per cent)will be raised from  740 to 85O.     The rates of all the allowances paid with disablement benefit will alsobe increased.     The pension for widows, which is at present  7.30, will be raised to  8.30.     Further details of the industrial injuries benefits are given inAppendix II.PART IVWAR PENSIONSDisablement pensioners13.   The 100 per cent rate of disablement pension for a private will go up from 11.20 to  12.80, with proportionate increases for lower assessments;   officers1rates will be similarly increased.    All the supplementary allowances associated withdisablement are being raised.     Those benefits increased last year will go up bythe same proportion as the basic pension, whilst comforts allowance, paid withunemployability supplement and constant attendance allowance, and severe disablementoccupational allowance, both of which were last raised in 1971, will go up by 30 percent.     There will also be a further increase in the annual rate of clothing allowance.14.   Two other changes will benefit disablement pensioners.     The number of ratesof constant attendance allowance is to be reduced from 5 to 4 by the abolition ofthe three-quarter day rate.     Those war pensioners receiving this rate will insteadget the normal maximum rate, giving them an increase of  1.75 a week.     Secondly,it has been decided that there should be no reduction in national insurancedependency benefits or in the dependency benefits paid with unemployabilitysupplement to take account of the allowances for a wife and       children paid withbasic disablement pensions.     In future a man will receive the full insurance benefits for his wife and children regardless of the small dependency allowances3
(maximum 50p for a wife and 37ih? for a child) paid with his war pension.     Thechange vdli be of greatest value to those men with families who are severelydisabled - the unemployable war pensioner who is married with two children will,for instance, get an extra  1.25 as a result of this change alone - whilst thosewho have allowances at lower rates will no longer hage the deductions of smallsums from their benefits which are currently made.     An administrative savingwill also result.&apos;.7ar widows15.   The standard rate of war pension for the widow of a private soldier will beincreased from  8.80 to  10.10 a week, whilst the pensions for widows of non-commissioned, warrant and commissioned officers will be similarly increased.The magi mum rate of rent allowance, payable to a widow with dependent children,is being raised by 5Op to  3.90, whilst the age allowances for elderly widows,last raised in 1971, go up by 30 per cent from 5Q  to 65p for those between 65and 70 and from  1 to  1.30 for those over 70.l6.   Under changes introduced in 1971 war widows1 pension and allowances are paid irrespective of the cause of death to a widow whose war -disabled husband was receiving constant attendance allowance at the normal maximum or a higher rate.The substitution of the normal maximum rate for the three-quarter day-ratedescribed in paragraph 14 will increase the number of cases where a war widow&apos;pension is awarded automatically on the death of the pensioner.Table of rates17.   Details of the changes in the main rates of war pensions and allowances aregiven in Appendix III.PART VSUPPLEMENTARY benefits the scale rates and the long-term addition18.   The Government also propose to raise supplementary benefit levels.     increases of  1 for a single householder and  1,60 for a married couple, as in the standard ratof retirement pensions and other long-term national insurance benefits, will alsogo to supplementary pensioners and,with the exception of those required to registerfor work, to people under pension age who have received supplementary benefit for two years or more.    Other supplementary benefit     -    rates will go up by 60p
for a person living alone, and by  1 for a married couple, in line with the increases in the short-term national insurance benefits.   Increases proportionate to the long-term and short-term supplementary benefit increases will be made in the rate for non-nouseholders, and children&apos;s rates will be increased in proportion to the short-termincreases.19.   The long-terra addition - which dates from the inception of the supplementary benefits scheme in I966 - is intended to provide for extra expenses of the kind whichnay be expected to arise in long-term cases.     It is proposed to incorporate thisaddition, of 60p for those under the age of 80 and of 85p for those over 80 into newlong-term rates.     At present, fjOp of the long-term addition of 60p (75p of the ratefor those over 80) is normally taken into account when further additions for exceptionalexpenses are being considered.   Similarly, 50p of the new long-term rates (75p of therates for those over 80) will be required to be treated as meeting any exceptionalexpensesj but see paragraph 21 for exceptional heating expenses.     The consolidation ofthe long-term addition is considered necessary in order to enable the differentialincreases in long-term cases to be reflected fully and effectively in the supplementaryoenefits scheme and because the purpose and operation of the long-term addition, as aseparate element, has in any event given rise to confusion and misunderstanding.The Government therefore hope that the restructuring involved will make the schemeeasier for people to understand,20.   A supplementary pensioner living alone who is now entitled to  7.15 a week plusrent and rates will become entitled to  8.15 a week plus rent and rates, or  8.40 aweek plus rent and rates if he or she is over 80.     A supplementary pensioner couplenow entitled to  11.25 a week plus rent and rates will become entitled to  12.85 av/eek plus rent and rates, or  13.10 plus rent and rates if one (or both) of them is over 80.Extra heating expenses21. As from 1 October any extra allowances on account of exceptional heating expensesmade under the Supplementary Benefits Commission&apos;s discretionary powers for pensioners and others entitled to the new long-term . rates will be paid on top of these new rates, instead of being offset against that part of them which is available to meetexceptional expenses (see paragraph 19).   Thus supplementary benefit recipients will beentitled to the full amount of any additional heating allowances awarded because oftheir individual circumstances.Table of rates22.   Details of the supplementary benefit increases are given in Appendix IV.Part yicontribution chances23.   The Government propose to meet the cost of the improvements in the benefitspayable from the National Insurance Funds mainly by increasing the graduated contributions paid on earnings of more than  9 a week and by raising the flat-rate5
contributions paid by employers.     This latter change continues the processbegun last year of placing a higher proportion of the total contribution onemployers, in preparation for the contribution changes envisaged in the social security Bill now before Parliament.Graduated contributions24.   The weekly earnings limit up to which graduated contributions are paid isto be raised from  48 to  54 and the rate of graduated contributions for employers and employees will be increased by 5 per cent.     Persons who arecontracted out will therefore pay contributions of 5 per cent on earnings between 9 and  18 a week and of 5 Ver cent on earnings between  18 and  54 a week,while those not contracted out will pay at the rate of 5 per cent on earnings between  9 and  54 a week.     The additional contributions will earn correspondinggraduated pension rights.25.   The employer&quot;s share of the flat-rate contribution will be increased by 14pa week for a man, 12p for a woman, 7p for a boy and 6p for a girl.     The adultemployee1s share of the contribution will be reduced by 4p.     The earningsthreshold at which contributions normally become payable will be raised from  Joto  7.26.   Increases are also to be made in the flat-rate contributions of self-employed and non-employed persons, who do not pay graduated contributions, so as to ensurethat they pay their fair share of the cost of improved benefits.     Self-employedmen will pay an extra 25p a week and women an-, extra 21p.     For the non-employedthe increases will be 19p for a man and 15p for a woman.     There are proportionateincreases for self-employed and non-employed juveniles.     The earnings level atwhich self-employed persons1    contributions normally become payable will beraised from  5 to  6 a week.     At present self-employed or non-employed persons with an income of  468 a year or less can obtain exception from the liability topay contributions.     This limit is being raised to  520 a year.Industrial injuries contributions27.   The cost of industrial injuries benefits is met by flat-rate industrial injuries contributions which are usually payable as part of the combined national insurance contributions.     2p of the increase in the employer1 s share of the flat-rate contributions for adults is for industrial injuries purposes.rIstricted
The new contribution rates28.   Examples of the effects of the proposed contribution changes on the weeklyamounts payable by employed men and women, and their employers, are set out inappendix V, Table A.     Table B of that Appendix shows the proposed main rates offlat-rate contributions for employed, self-employed and non-employed persons.PART VIICOSTS29.   The cost of the proposed changes will be about  570 million in 197-V75.About  480 million - including  370 million for retirement pensions - will bepaid out of the National Insurance Fund, and  18 million out of the industrial injuries Fund.     The remaining cost will be met from the Consolidated Fund:-  39million for uprating and improving supplementary benefitj    21 million for additional expenditure on war pensions;    3 million for uprating old persons1pensions;      .  9 million for uprating attendance allowance; and about  1 million for family income supplement.     The Exchequer contribution to the National insurance funds will also be increased so as to maintain the total Exchequer support to thenational insurance schemes at about 18 per cent of contribution income.7
