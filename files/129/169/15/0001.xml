NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE REORGANISATION:  TOP salaries memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social Servicesla The timetable for National Health Service (NHS) reorganisation,which must take place at the same time as local government reorganisation on 1 April 1974, requires that top posts (doctors,administrators, nurses) be advertised early in May.    These are new posts,serving authorities which are to be responsible for administeiing integratedhospital, local health and family practitioner services, and as such are not specifically provided for in the Pay Code, though, in the light ofparagraph 133 of the Code, it is obviously necessary to have in mind whatis paid to those at the top of the present separate services,,    Details ofthe posts are at Annex C02,        It has not been possible in confidential negotiations to reach agreement with the Staff Associations on the salaries I was authorised tooffer for the regional posts (see column headed &quot;CIM(P) limits&quot; in annex C).    These were lowei than I would have wished and I sought authority from the Ministerial Sub-Committee on Pay Negotiations toimprove them and to agree that the doctors (community physicians) shouldbe eligible, like hospital consultants, for &quot;distinction awards&quot; (see Annex A).The Sub-Committee were unable to agree to my proposals because of the constraints of the counter-inflation policy and the possible repercussionselsewhere, and invited me to bring the matter to the Cabinet.3. The Sub-Committee considered that we should unilaterally advise the NHS Staff Commission, who are handling the arrangements for fillingthese posts, to advertise for administrators and nurses at the figures sofar offered and that we should invite the Doctors and Dentists Review Body(DDRB) to recommend the maximum of  9, 786 for doctors previouslydiscussed by officials.    In my view the consequences of this will be -a.        The DDRB will recommend unacceptably high salaries forthese doctors.    We should have to reject the recommendation and become involved in a fierce dispute with the profession.    TheBritish Medical Association would advise their members not to apply for posts in the reorganised service.    (They would also do this ifthe DDRB recommended salaries at the level I am asked to propose).1CP(73) 55 COPY NO   gg10 April 1973CABINET
b. The National Association of Local Government Officers andthe Royal College of Nursing may also advise their members not toapply, but, more probable, the whole programme would be slowed down by the reorganisation proposals being challenged at every stage of consultation with the Department and Staff Commission(see Annex B).The result would certainly be postponement of NHS reorganisation,,    Thiswould involve looking again at local government reorganisation, since thepresent proposal is to transfer local health services to the NHS when thathappens, and this transfer cannot take place if there are no new NHSauthorities,,4.        Quite apart from this, I consider that to insist on the levels of salary so far offered is indefensible on merits.    The current offers give an improvement on existing hospital rates to administrators and nursesquite incommensurate with the extended responsibilities of the new authorities in which hospital, local health authority and family pratitionerservices will be merged.    The figure for the administrator of Regions whichspan several local authorities is around  1, 000 below the level proposed bythe employers for the top salary of chief officers of departments of localauthorities.    For doctors, the figure suggested is upwards of  1, 000 below what top Medical Officers of Health are getting now - yet the posts will bemore demanding and wider-ranging.    Nurses should have a greaterproportionate increase because they are to be members of the managementteam,5,        I am willing to advertise (and go to the DDRB for doctors) at lowerfigures than I suggested to the Sub-Committee,,    For doctors I would put the case to the Review Body for distinction awards together with proposalsfor medical salaries at a top figure of  10, 000.    For administrators and nurses I would advise the Staff Commission to advertise provisionally witha top figure &quot;not less than&quot;  9, 000 ( 6, 300 for nurses) and inform the staff side that negotiations would continue with a view to settling final salaries in the light of the DDRB&apos;s recommendations for doctors.    In view of theadditional responsibilities attaching to the new posts, these salaries are inmy view well within what would be consistent with the spirit of the Pay Code.They would not carry Staff Side agreement but the prospect of further negotiation should stave off disruptive tactics; whereas a straight impositionof salaries and refusal of further negotiation (pending review in 1974-75)would inevitably attract the consequences described in Annex B unless ai toplevels of  9,500 for administrators and  7,125 for nurses.6.        I invite the Cabinet to agree the following figures (1972 levels)Doctors  10, 000 (with eligibility for distinction awards)Administrators      9, 000 (with negotiations continuing)Nurses  6, 300     &quot; &quot; &quot;K department of Health and Social Services10 April 1973
ANNEX a distinction AWARDS1.     Distinction awards are given to about one-third of hospitalconsultants for exceptional individual merit on the recommendationsof an independent committees   the highest A award is  7,350 (100 inEngland and Wales) the lowest C award  1,392 (2,258 in England andWales).   They are paid in addition to the consultants basic salary( 7,350 max).2.     The case for distinction awards for community physicians is thatno medical specialty should be relegated to a subordinate place bydenying its members access to the highest levels of remuneration;that unless community medicine has the same system as hospitalmedicine it will not attract recruits of adequate calibre; and thatequivalent status is necessary if the community physicians are to be effective.3.     Moreover, if the Review Body is asked to recommend salaries for community medicine on the basis that there will not be available any distinction awards they will be likely to pitch their salaryrecommendations at a high level, embarrassing in itself and for itsrelativities with other chief officers.   They might even regard theconsultant plus top A award ( 14*700)as a ceiling figure.4.     In a hierarchical system promotion from grade to grade is thenormal reward of merit;   but in the case of community medicine onlyone in six will holu a job with a salary above the basic;   it isproposed to pay all the rest at the equivalent of the basic consultant( 7,350).   Many community physicians at district level will be ableto show high individual merit, without securing (or wishing tosecure) promotion.    If a doctor was one of those appointed to the100 or so higher posts, he would be eligible to receive a distinctionaward, but the amount of the award would be abated by the amount his salary for the post exceeded the salary of the basic grade.5.     Community physicians should be regarded as doctors exercisingmedical skills, sometimes in an administrative context, and not asadministrators who happen to be doctors.    Their prospects should therefore equate to those of other doctorsj.
