RELOCATION OF DEFENCE FACILITIES FROM SHOEBURYNESS

Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department

1. The Proof and Experimental Establishment at Shoeburyness must be moved to make way for the Maplin Airport. It has not been possible to find a single site for it, and the facilities are planned to be dispersed between existing ranges at Eskmeals, Ty Croes, Kirkcudbright, Spadeadam and Tain.

2. The choice of Tain has aroused considerable local hostility, and the Ross and Cromarty County Council have refused planning permission for the change of use involved in converting the range from air to ground weapons. When we discussed this on 7 December last we recognised that it might in the end prove necessary to go there, but we had grave misgivings about the political implications. Since then the Ministry of Defence have made a further exhaustive review of sites in the United Kingdom and overseas, the results of which have been considered successively by the Ministerial Committees on Regional Policy and the environment and Defence and Oversea Policy. These discussions have established that the facilities in question must be reprovided, and that the choice lies between five ranges: Castlemartin, Lulworth, Pembrey, Tain and West Freugh. The main factors affecting each are as follows.

CASTLEMARTIN

3. This is a tank training range used by the Royal Armoured Corps (RAC) and the Federal German Army (FRG). Both would have to be moved; and if training facilities were to be reprovided for the FRG we would need to acquire 5000 acres at Kirkcudbright. If the Shoeburyness facilities go to Castlemartin, the RAG Gunnery School, now at Lulworth, will either have to stay there (so that Lulworth cannot be given up) or move to Kirkcudbright. If the RAC Gunnery School went to Kirkcudbright without reprovision of facilities for the FRG, only some 1500 acres would be required. To move the Gunnery School and the FRG to Kirkcudbright and the Shoeburyness facilities to castle martin would cost, in very round figures, about Â£72 million. This would be much the most expensive solution.


LULWORTH4.        It would cost about  48 million to move the Shoeburyness facilities to Lulworth.    There would be some advantages: firing would much decreasefrom present levels, some land could be given up and public accessimproved, and there would be extra jobs in an area of relatively high localunemployment.    It would avoid the cry that other parts of Great britain should not be sacrificed to the interests of the South.    But for years therehas been a campaign to get the Army out of Lulworth; its release is likelyto be the major recommendation of Lord Nugent&apos;s Committee on defencelands;  and once it was known that the RAC Gunnery School could at lastbe moved, only to be replaced by another Defence activity, there would bea major environmental storm.PEMBREY5.        At about  36 million this would be the cheapest solution.    But theRoyal Air Force would have to move their present range to castle martin,which they stopped using about five years ago because of local complaints:to return with a higher intensity of flying would provoke strong opposition.On top of this, our predecesscrs held a public inquiry into an earlierproposal to use Pembrey for all the facilities from Shoeburyness; greathostility was aroused, and we had to drop the idea.    Since then the localauthorities have prepared plans for a country park in the area.    If Pembreywere selected for even a part of the Shoeburyness facilities this scheme would be negated;  and the Secretary of State for Wales considers that to revive the proposal to go to Pembrey in any form would provoke militantopposition.TAIN6. This would cost about  57 million.    The site is already in use asan air weapons range; for its conversion about 300 more acres (which theowners are willing to sell) would be needed.    Tain is the unanimous choicefor this purpose of the Nugent Committee, and the overall level of serviceactivity would actually be reduced.    But there were expectations locallythat the range might be released altogether.    The area already suffersfrom almost excessive development through North Sea oil, and, almostalone in Scotland, needs no new jobs.    The opposition is as much political as environmental: we should be represented as imposing a burden ofnuisance on Scotland in the interests of providing a new airport for south East England, and we cannot overlook the advantage which our political opponents in this and other Scottish constituencies might gain from so unpopular a decision.    As against this, a decision to resite theShoeburyness facilities at Tain would be consistent with our declared aim off opening the Maplin Airport by 1980o    Going to castle martin or Pembreywould mean a delay of at least a year beyond 1980, and to Lulworth a considerably longer period.2
LULWORTH4.        It would cost about  48 million to move the Shoeburyness facilities to Lulworth.    There would be some advantages:  firing would much decreasefrom present levels, some land could be given up and public accessimproved, and there would be extra jobs in an area of relatively high localunemployment.

Going to castle martin or Pembreywould mean a delay of at least a year beyond 1980, and to Lulworth a considerably longer period.2
WEST FREUGH7. The Secretary of State for Defence has set out the penalties in defence terms that would be incurred by combining at West Freugh theShoeburyness facilities with work on the multi-role combat aircraft..    on political and environmental grounds objections to West Freugh are unlikely to be nearly as strong as those against Tain, Lulworth or Pembrey; butthe military difficulties are evidently serious.    There would a.&apos;.so be atleast as much delay as would arise from a move to Lrulworth88. There remains the question of a public inquiry.    It would be normalto offer a public inquiry for a move to any of these sites.    If we do not, weshall certainly be criticised; if v/e do, we shall eventually, no doubt, be faced with an adverse recommendation at a time when the pressure for adecision will be more urgent than ever.    Wherever we decide to goc weshall do ourselves no good by offering a public inquiry on a matter which,as our own discussions have shown, really admits of no alternative,    when we have made our choice I believe that we should announce the selection ofall the sites which will accommodate the facilities from Shoeburynesssimultaneously as a Government decision.R home Office2 April 19733
