LEGISIATIVE PROGRAMME 1973-74 session memorandum by the Lord President of the council. The Ministerial Committee on Future Legislation have now considered the proposals put forward by Departments for legislation duringthe 1973-74 Session.    The programme which we recommend is set out in annex Ae2, The burden of legislation has been very heavy since we took office;and we must now take particular care9 in putting forward our programmeof legislation for the last full Session of this Parliament, to ensure that itcomprises measures which are politically attractive and which will command the general approval of our supporters and not make wholly unwarranteddemands on their time.    This programme is not as attractive as I wouldhave liked.    I would, therefore^ urge my colleagues to give particularthought between now and the end of the year to the development of policies which might be incorporated in short and attractive measures for the session after next,3* The details of the programme which we recommend are set out in annex A under the following headings and arranged under Departments -Essential Bills - that is Bills which must be obtained by a specificdate.Contingent Bills - Bills which may become Essential in the abovesense.Main Programme BillsBills in Reserve - Bills which would have good claims to be includedin the programme if places could be found.Bills for Scottish Grand CommitteeBilla for Second Reading Committee Procedure - which will only beintroduced if they can be drafted and the Opposition agree to theSecond Reading Committee procedure.1CP(73) 42 COPY NO28 March 1973CABINET
J privy Council Office28 March 19732SECRETAnnex B list3 the suggested Bills for which we can find no place inthe programme;  and Annex C sets out other matters on which theremay be pressure for legislation.4. The proposed programme contains 12 substantial Bills (of 35 or moreclauses) besides the Scottish Grand Committee Bills.    We are left withuncomfortably little margin, particularly in terms of Floor time in theHouse of Commons, to cope with measures which will probably be needed on, for example, Northern Ireland^ Nationality and Discrimination againstWomen, which are not allowed for in the programme.5.        I should draw particular attention to the following measures whichhave been included in the programme: Representation of the People (in theEssential List);  Channel Tunnel (in the Contingent List); Safety and Healthat Work;  Local Government, which should, however, be confined topolitically attractive and non-controversial provisions, especially as it isnecessary for it to be enacted early in the Session;   a combined Townand Country Planning and House Improvement measure, which should be confined essentially to proposals to implement the formcoming White paper on Housing Policy in the 1970s;  Environment Protection, on which we have yet to decide, however, whether to include provisions on clean air andnoise;  a combined Road Traffic and Owner Liability Bill, which will also have to be limited to essential and attractive provisions; Nurses, Midwivesand Health Visitors which, however, can be included only if it is certain tobe ready at the start of the Session; Company Law; Consumer Credit;Tax Credit.    For these measures, in particular, I would ask all mycolleagues to make every effort to settle outstanding policy issues and complete drafting instructions quickly.    I shall also be writing to individual colleagues about this aspect.6,        In inviting the Cabinet to approve this programme I would ask themto bear in mind that in order to find places for any Bills which have been omitted we should have to make compensating reductions.
