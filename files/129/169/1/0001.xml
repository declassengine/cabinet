SECTION 1Introduction1. This White Paper deals with the operation of Stage Two of the counter-inflation programme.2. On 17 January 1973 the Government outlined their proposals for StageTwo in Cmnd. 5205, and on 23 January the necessary legislation was intro-duced in Parliament. On 26 February the Government published in Cmnd.5247 a Consultative Document on the Price and Pay Code and this has since been debated in Parliament and has been the subject of intensive consulta-tions with representatives of industry and commerce, of consumers and ofthe professions.3. The Counter-Inflation Act, 1973 received Royal Assent on 22 March.Under the powers it gives, the Price Commission and Pay Board will shortly be established. Their main function under the Act in Stage Two is to implement the Price and Pay Code. The statutory instrument containing the code must therefore be made soon so that they can begin that task. section of this White Paper is a draft of the Code, in preparing which the Govern-ment have been able to take account of the consultations of recent weeks.The Government propose to make the order containing the Code in its final form on 1 April. This will supersede the draft in this White Paper, and theproposals in the White Paper of 17 January and the Green Paper of26 February. The 1 April order will activate Part II of the Act, with its powers for regulating prices and pay, and will mark the end of the paystandstill, though the standstill will continue until 28 April for prices. Boththe Price Commission and Pay Board will be operational from 1 April.4. However, this White Paper deals with more than the Price and pay code. Section 3 describes the administration of dividend control which willbe operated by the Treasury in Stage Two. Section 4 explains how Stage Twowill be applied to certain cases which are not within the statutory controlpowers of the Price Commission and Pay Board. They include business and agricultural rents, prices and pay which are determined by the Crown or are already governed by statutory bodies and certain prices and chargessuch as insurance premiums which will be directly controlled by the Govern-ment. Section 5 deals with the arrangements for pre-notification and report-ing which the Government propose in order to support the work of theCommission and the Board.5. Most of the matters referred to in paragraph 4 pre-notification,dividends, business and agricultural rents will require the making of separate orders by Ministers under the Counter-Inflation Act at the beginningof Stage Two.The Objective6. The object of the programme is to bring inflation under control. It isnow generally accepted that this is necessary if we are to achieve sustained
growth, higher real incomes, especially for the low paid and pensioners,and the confidence required for higher industrial investment. Moreover,inflation is fundamentally unfair and imposes severe strains on our society.Progress in Stage One7. A start has been made in Stage One in bringing inflation under control in spite of an exceptionally rapid rate of increase in world pricesof foodstuffs and basic raw materials. Between November and Februarycosts of basic materials and fuel purchased by manufacturers generally roseby almost 11 per cent., but their prices in the home market roseby only 1 per cent. The corresponding costs of food manufacturers rose overthe same period by 15 per cent., while their prices also rose by little morethan 1 per cent. The index of hourly wage rates remained almost steadybetween November and February, with the result that the percentage increase on a year earlier fell from 16.5 per cent, to 13.5 per cent. However, it takestime for changes in pay costs, like changes in the level of world prices, tohave their full effect on our price level. Pay increases at pre-standstill rates will continue to put up costs and prices for some months yet, and the beneficial effects on prices of the pay standstill will not be felt in full until later in 1973.8. Moderating the rate of cost and price inflation was one of the agreedobjectives in the tripartite talks between the Government, the TUC and CBIlast autumn. The Government have during Stage One continued to pursue the two other agreed objectives. The Budget reflected the governments intention of maintaining a high rate of growth and included provision for asubstantial increase in retirement pensions effective from 1 October. As aresult of this, retirement pensions will have been increased by the present government in three upratings by nearly twice as much as the increase inprices.Stage Two and beyond9. Stage Two moves on from the standstill. It is not an abandonment of restraint, or a return to the pre-standstill situation. It therefore contains pricecontrols which are still strict, but also realistic. There are no automatic per-centage increases and every price increase has to be justified by referenceto the Code. On pay, on the other hand, Stage Two provides for an increase which is substantial by any normal standard, and it makes special provision,reflected at a number of points in tne draft Code, to help the low paid.10. Stage Two lasts only until the autumn. Subject to the process of consultation and any necessary Parliamentary approval, the Government atpresent envisage that the next stage of the policy will begin at about the endof October. In Stage Two some inequalities of treatment which are unavoidable-able in any programme to control an inflation like that of last autumn are bound to remain, both on prices and on pay. The Government intend duringthe summer to consult both sides of industry on the policy for Stage Three,and the decisions based on these consultations will, where necessary, be embodied in the next Code, subject to the approval of Parliament.11. In this way the Code can, for example, be altered to reflect as necessary whatever arrangements are eventually decided as an outcome of
the study which the Government have commissioned from the Pay board for making progress towards the resolution of problems of pay relativitiesand anomalies in Stage Three. Similarly, it can be modified to take accountof the growing requirements of investment in the private sector, and theneed of some nationalised industries to return to commercial viability.12. The Governments over-riding aim in Stage Three will be to continueeffective action against inflation. The Governments preference for the achievement of this aim on a voluntary tripartite basis remains. They wishto explore the possibilities of doing so in the course of the consultationsduring Stage Two.13. In the interests of the community as a whole, the Government seek theco-operation of all in industry and commerce in the operation of Stage Two.These are fair proposals designed to benefit everybo&quot;dy through the exerciseof reasonable restraint.

SECTION draft Price and Pay Code14. The Code has a dual function. First, the Price Commission and pay board are required to exercise their powers so as to ensure that it is imple-mented. Secondly, all those concerned with the determination of prices and pay should have regard to it.15. The Code is therefore addressed both to the Commission and theBoard and to all those concerned with price and pay determination. Part Ideals with prices and Part II with pay.Part I PricesGeneral Principles16.  The general principles relating to prices are:  (i) to limit the extent to which prices may be increased on accountof increased costs, and to secure reductions as a result of reducedcosts;(ii) to reinforce the control of prices by a control on profit marginswhile safeguarding investment;(iii) to reinforce the effects of competition, and to secure its fullbenefits in the general level of prices.Field of Application17. With the exceptions specified in paragraphs 18 to 23 below, theprices of goods and services supplied to the United Kingdom home marketare within the scope of the control.18. The prices of goods and services exported (whether directly or through an agent or merchant) are not controlled.19.  The following are not controlled:  (i) prices paid on first sale into the United Kingdom of imported goods and services;(ii) prices of goods and services where the application of the con-trol would be inconsistent with an international agreement orarrangement. For this purpose, an international agreement orarrangement is one between states or organisations of states,not between firms;(iii) prices at sales by auction, where such sales are a normal prac-tice in the particular trade;(iv) prices of goods at the point of sale on a commodity market inthe United Kingdom such as the London Metal Exchange orprices directly determined by reference to such markets;(v) prices of second-hand goods (other than second-hand roadvehicles sold by distributors);
(vi) charges for the carriage of goods or passengers on internationaljourneys; charges for air navigation, landing and related ser-vices and ship, passenger and goods dues, provided that they relate wholly or mainly to such traffic; charges for internationalmail and telecommunication services;(vii) prices of ethical medicines supplied to the United kingdom market to the extent that regulation of their prices is withinthe scope of any agreement relating to those prices made between the Secretary of State for Social Services and repre-sentatives of manufacturers of those medicines; but only solong as such an agreement is in force;(viii) prices in contracts with the Secretary of State for Defence forwarlike stores and services which are within the agreementbetween Her Majesty&apos;s Government and industry governing the pricing of, and control of profit from non-competitivecontracts. These prices will be subject to the controls provided in that agreement;(ix) insurance premiums, which will be subject to restriction by theSecretary of State for Trade and Industry;(x) subscriptions and certain prices charged by non-profit-makingorganisations as in paragraphs 111 to 113.Application to Food, Farming and Forestry Products20. The prices of manufactured food and drink, like those of manu-factured products generally, are within the scope of the control as arethose of semi-processed foodstuffs such as butter, sugar and quick-frozenvegetables.21. The prices paid to United Kingdom producers or producers&apos; organisa-tions or to overseas suppliers for fresh foods and similar productsO), whichare subject to fluctuations on world and United Kingdom markets because ofseasonal factors or changes in the relationship between supply and demand,are not controlled. This applies in particular to meat, including bacon and poultry, fish, eggs, fruit and vegetables. However, enterprises which resellthese products, whether home-produced or imported, at any subsequentstage will be subject to control.22. The retail price of milk for liquid consumption and the margins of milk distributors will continue to be subject to the existing controls by theMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State forScotland. So long as these controls apply, the price of milk for liquid con-sumption will not be subject to the Code.23. What is said in paragraph 21 in relation to prices paid for fresh foodsapplies also to prices of other primary products of animal or vegetableorigin which are subject to similar fluctuations.Charges24. References in the Code to prices include references to charges, unless there is explicit provision to the contrary.
Goods and Services25. References in the Code to goods include references to services, unless there is explicit provision to the contrary.Definition of Enterprise for the purposes of the Code26. For the purposes of the Code an enterprise means either an enterpriseas a whole or a separate constituent company or sub-division provided thatin the latter case separate accounts for such sub-divisions: (i) are or can be made available for all relevant periods;(ii) are not materially distorted by transactions conducted otherwise than on arms length terms;(iii) would, if combined with one another and with the accounts of allother activities or transactions of the enterprise, produce resultsconsistent with those shown by the accounts of the enterprise taken as a whole.27. Where the activities of an enterprise are not confined to manufacturing,distribution, or the provision of services, but include more than one of these,each of these activities may be treated separately for the purpose of the Codeprovided that adequate accounts satisfying paragraph 26 are or can be madeavailable for each of them. Where these activities are not treated separately,the main activity of the enterprise will determine whether the provisions ofthe Code relating to manufacturing, distribution or services apply.28. Any reference in the Code to an enterprise includes a reference to aseparate constituent company or sub-division as defined in paragraph 26 orin paragraph 27.Costs and Prices29.&apos; Prices which are within the control may not be incre;&quot;&quot;-&quot; un&apos;lcss t&quot;ereis an increase in total costs per unit of output. No &apos;&quot;-*v;ase ma&quot; exceed theincrease in total costs per unit.30. Where there is an in^&quot;^ 111 totalcosis P01&quot; B&amp;it, only certain increases,referred to in th* code as &quot;allowable cost increases&quot;, may be taken intoaccount in arriving at the permitted price increase, and they will be subjectto a productivity deduction.Price Reduction31. Prices should be reduced whenever possible. Where there is a fall inraw material prices or other allowable costs, this should be fully reflected in price reductions. Reductions are however not required to exceed the fallin total costs per unit of output. In addition prices should be reduced as required in paragraph 61 where an enterprise approaches or exceeds its profit margin reference level.Base Date32. The starting point for the calculation of permitted price increases isthe level of costs per unit of output at 30 September 1972. In calculating
permitted price increases, cost increases first incurred after 30 September 1972may be taken into account, to the extent that they have not already been reflected in prices. However, the permitted price increase may not include any element of retrospective recovery of costs incurred before the date on whichthe price increase takes effect.Calculation of Permitted Price Increase33. The maximum permitted price increase should be arrived at asfollows 0:  (i) calculate the change in total costs per unit and allowable cost increases per unit (as reduced by the productivity deduction) be-tween 30 September and the date of the price increase; cost increases which have already been reflected in prices should be excluded;(ii) express allowable cost increases per unit as a percentage of total costs per unit at 30 September;(iii) apply the resulting percentage to the selling price in order to estab-lish the new permitted price level.Where a price increase is made after 28 April 1973, the date of that increase may be used as the base date for calculating subsequent price increasesinstead of 30 September 1972.34. The calculation of the level of costs per unit at 30 September referredto in paragraph 33 should be based on the levels of pay and other costsruling at 30 September and on the level of output over the most recentrepresentative period completed by 30 September (eg the quarter to 30September) for which adequate records are available. Similarly the calcu-lation of costs per unit at the date of the price increase may take accountof increases in raw material prices and other allowable cost increases up tothe 0j tjje prjce increase ancj should reflect the output level achieved inthe most re^.* representative period (eg the quarter preceding the date ofthe price increase).35. The levels of unit costs cau,uwftd ;n this way will not necessarily bethe same as the average figures recorded for u,. whole of the period choseneg if pay or other costs changed during the period. It output in the period was materially affected by abnormal factors such as holidays, an appropriateadjustment should be made. If this is impossible, the previous normal operatingperiod should be chosen with appropriate adjustments to allow for changesin the level of pay or other costs.36. Where price increases are being made not on a single product but ona range of related products (under paragraph 50 or 51) the procedure inparagraphs 33 to 35 still applies. But in this case the group of related products should be considered as a single product; the costs per unit can be expressed either as costs per unit of volume of output or if a volume measureis impracticable as costs per   of sales value. Where the calculated permittedpercentage price increase is not applied uniformly to the whole range of products, the weighted average percentage price increase made on the selling prices of the products within the group may not exceed this percentage.
Allowable Cost Increases37. Subject to the following paragraphs, a cost increase may be regardedas an allowable cost increase for the purpose of paragraph 30 if:  (i) it was first incurred after 30 September 1972 (&apos;); and(ii) it was incurred for one of the following: (a) labour; (&apos;)(b) materials, components, fuel and power;(c) rent of premises or rates;(d) interest charges, as defined in paragraph 40;(e) certain bought-in services, that is: transport, hire of equipment,insurance, storage, maintenance and engineering services not ofa capital nature; and(iii) it has not already been reflected in prices.Pay not consistent with the Code38. Cost increases arising from increases in pay (as denned in paragraph116) after 6 November 1972 are allowable cost increases only to the extent that, as appropriate:  (i) they were consistent with the policies set out in the White PapersCmnd. 5125 and Cmnd. 5205 (and do not contravene an order ornotice under the Counter-Inflation (Temporary Provisions) Act,1972);or(ii) as regards the period commencing on 1 April 1973, they are con-sistent with this Code (and do not contravene an order or noticeunder the Counter-Inflation Act 1973).39. Examples of cost increases which are not allowable cost increasesbecause they are inconsistent with the Code are:  (i) any part of a pay increase which exceeds the pay limit; or(ii) any part of increases in pay under settlements made at local or plantlevel which, when aggregated with increases under a national agree-ment, exceeds the pay limit for the group concerned; and(iii) any part of increases in earnings arising from piecework or otherpayment by results schemes which exceeds the pay limit,unless the increase is specifically exempted from the pay limit by Part II ofthe Code.Interest Charges40. Increases in interest charges payable by an enterprise are allowable cost increases, unless the charges or the increases in them:  (i) represent a distribution of profits rather than a true interest charge; or(ii) where they arise on loans between related undertakings, relate toloans which are not strictly required for the business, or represent
interest in excess of that which would be charged in a transactionat arm&apos;s length; or(iii) represent interest which would properly be regarded as capitalexpenditure in the period in which it is incurred.Productivity Deduction41. In order to ensure that the benefits of increased productivity are passed on to the consumer, a deduction should be made from allowable cost increases which are to be passed on as price increases. Enterprises are required to absorb 50 per cent, of allowable cost increases arising from increases in labour costs, with the exclusions listed in paragraph 42, unless the share of labour costs as a whole in their total costs exceeds 35 per cent. In that case enterprisesare required to absorb only an amount equal to the percentage of total costs which would apply if labour costs represented 35 per cent, of total costs. 042. The deduction for productivity under paragraph 41 need not be appliedto increases in: employers&apos; national insurance contributions; training costs; the costof improvements under paragraph 135 (equal pay), paragraph 146(recognised terms and conditions), paragraph 147 (pensions) and paragraph 149 (redundancy and incapacity benefits).Allocation of Costs to Controlled Prices43. Allocation of costs to particular controlled goods or services for the calculation of allowable costs increases may be necessary where an enter-prise: (i) sells in both home and overseas markets; or(ii) makes sales at home, some of which are within and some outside thescope of the control; or(iii) makes sales of different products or groups of products which are within the control, and has to divide costs between them for thepurposes of the Code.Where such an enterprise: (a) has made allocations which represent a fair division of costs in itscircumstances, over part or all of the field; and(b) has done so on a consistent basis,it should continue to use this basis for all calculations relevant to the Code.In other cases enterprises may make such allocations by dividing costs in proportion to the value of sales in each area, or on any other basis which represents good accounting practice, provided that it adheres to the chosenbasis for all calculations relevant to the Code.Stocks44. In calculating the cost of current production or sales, enterprises may need to include an element for stocks of raw materials, of components or of finished goods, drawn on for production or sales. When making such
calculations in order to arrive at costs per unit of output and at any allowable cost increases, enterprises should adhere to the practice they have followedconsistently for the treatment of such costs for pricing purposes.Transfer Prices45. Where the Price Commission are satisfied that prices, either of purchasesor of sales, which an enterprise proposes to regard as a basis for the calcula-tion of allowable cost increases or of net profit margins, differ from what theywould be if the goods or services had been transferred on an arm&apos;s lengthbasis, they may substitute modified cost increases or profit margins which intheir judgement fairly reflect what would be appropriate on that basis.Costs of certain small enterprises46.  Where the Commission are satisfied that: (i) significant cost increases, including allowable cost increases, have occurred or are about to occur in a sector of industry or commercewhich includes a considerable number of small enterprises, especially those providing services; and(ii) the information available to them indicates that these cost increases are likely to be of broadly the same order for a substantial numberof such enterprises, in respect either of some or of all the goods or services which they supply,the Commission may calculate average allowable cost increases for the relevantgoods or services. These increases should then be taken as the allowable cost increases for the relevant goods or services.47. In calculating average allowable cost increases under paragraph 46the Commission will take account of: (i) all relevant information available to them on cost increases for thegoods or services concerned, including information supplied by any trade association or other body which they consider is representativeof the enterprises concerned; and(ii) any other relevant provisions of the Code.48. The Commission will publish information about any average allow-able cost increases which they have determined under paragraphs 46 and 48,together with an indication of any price increases which they regard asjustified under the Code on the basis of those average allowable cost increases.49. Where the allowable cost increases of a particular enterprise differ from those published by the Commission under paragraph 46, that enterprisemay apply the normal provisions of the Code relating to allowable cost in-creases. It will be the responsibility of the enterprise to satisfy the Commissionif required that this was justified.Product Costs and Allowable Cost Increases&quot;Single Product&quot; Enterprises50.  Where an enterprise makes a single product or a single range of
products the calculations required by the Code may be carried out by reference to the costs and prices of that enterprise as a whole.Multi-Product Enterprises: Related Products51. This paragraph applies to enterprises making a variety of products.Where:-(i) allowable cost increases arise on one or more of a range of related products; and(ii) a price increase in respect of them is permissible under the Code,the enterprise need not relate the price increase for individual products withinthe range closely to the cost increase for each product, provided(a) it has been established practice to treat the range of products in thisway; and(b) the average increase in price, weighted by the value of sales in a recent period, will not exceed the sum of what the Code would permit on the products affected by the cost increases.52. In cases not covered by paragraphs 50 and 51 the calculations requiredby the Code should be made by reference to individual products.53.  In paragraphs 50, 51 and 52 &quot;products&quot; includes services.Anticipation of Cost Increases54. Prices may not be increased in anticipation of cost increases, except as described in paragraphs 55 and 56. However:  (i) an enterprise may determine and announce a price increaseconsistent with the Code which takes account of future allow-able cost increases which are already known as to both date and amount, provided that the price increase is not implementedbefore the allowable cost increases are incurred; and(ii) an enterprise required to pre-notify an intended price increase tothe Commission may seek the agreement of the Commission toa price increase consistent with the Code which takes accountof such known future cost increases, subject to the same provisoas in (i).55.  Where:-(i) a future allowable cost increase is already known, as to bothdate and amount; and(ii) it is proposed to quote a price for supply on demand which willnot be increased for at least 6 months from the date on whichit takes effect,an enterprise may average the future allowable cost increase over the periodof not less than 6 months for which they quote the price in arriving at aprice increase for that period, provided that:  (a) the total amount raised will not be increased by the averaging; and(b) the averaging is in accordance with a well established practice in the trade concerned.
56. This paragraph applies to tenders to the extent that they are at fixed prices. In framing such tenders, those concerned should have regard to the code, but where tenders are the custom of the trade(i) competitive tenders may provide for estimated future cost increases.(ii) non-competitive tenders may provide for estimated future cost increases if the contract is to run for at least 6 months fromthe date on which work is to begin.Escalation and Variation of Price Clauses57. Price increases under escalation or variation of price clauses shouldbe applied only to the extent that the increases are consistent with the Code.If, however, the aplication of the Code would cause or increase a loss on aparticular contract, taken as a whole, the terms of the escalation or varia-tion of price clauses may be applied to the extent necessary to avoid theloss, or the increase in it. In addition to new contracts, this paragraphapplies to existing contracts and to increases in prices under those contracts,to the extent that they relate to cost increases after 6 November 1972.Quantity or Quality Change and New Products58. A change in the quantity or quality of goods, or a change in a dis-count, is equivalent for the purposes of the Code to a change in the price.59. Quality change in goods or services, quantity change in sales units,or artificial creation of new products should not be used as a means of avoiding the requirements of the Code. Where the Commission form theopinion that this has been done, they may seek price reductions, or disallowor reduce price increases.Losses60. This paragraph applies to enterprises which are making a loss, or are under the Code at risk of doing so:  (i) where an enterprise is making a loss, it may increase prices tocover its costs;(ii) the provisions relating to allowable cost increases (includingthe productivity deduction) need not be applied to the extent that they would cause the enterprise to operate at a loss;(iii) in all other cases, including low profit cases under paragraphs 72and 73, the allowable cost increase provisions and the pro-duotivity deduction apply.Prices and Profit Margins61. Prices should be determined so as to secure that net profit margins,as defined in paragraph 62, do not exceed the average level of the best two ofthe last five years of account of the enterprise concerned ending not later than 30 April 1973 (the &quot;reference level&quot;).
62. &quot;Net profit margin&quot; means the margin of net profit expressed as a percentage of sales or turnover. &quot;Net profit&quot; means the net profit, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistentlyapplied by the enterprise concerned, which arises from trading operationswithin the control after taking into account all expenses of conducting and financing them, including depreciation and interest on borrowed money,with the exclusions listed in paragraph 40, but before deducting CorporationTax or Income Tax.Action where Profit Margin is likely to be exceeded63.  Where:-(i) the reference level has been exceeded; or(ii) in the light of interim accounts or other evidence, the referencelevel is likely to be exceeded, after taking account of seasonaland other distorting factors,abatements in allowable cost increases or price reductions should be made.The abatements or reductions should be sufficient to eliminate the actual or anticipated excess over the reference level as soon as reasonably possible,and to offset any excess which has already arisen in a period subsequent to30 April 1973. Abatements or reductions are however not required in respectof any excess arising in the period ending 30 April 1973.Unit for Profit Margins64. In calculating net profit margins under paragraph 61 enterprises mayopt to use: either    (i) the profits of the enterprise as a wholeor       (ii) the profits of separate constituent companies or sub-divisions as defined in paragraph 26 or 27,provided that they then adhere to the basis chosen for all the purposes of the code to which net profit margins are relevant.65. Paragraph 61 requires that prices should be determined so as tosecure that net profit margins do not exceed the reference level. A net profit margin calculated under paragraph 64(i) will be relevant for this purpose toall the prices of the enterprise as a whole. A net profit margin calculatedunder paragraph 64(H) will be relevant to the prices of the constituent com-pany or sub-division from the profit of which the margin has been derived.Allocation of Profits to Controlled Prices66. Allocation of profits between prices within the control and thosewhich are not may be necessary for the calculation of net profit margins.The requirements of paragraph 43 apply to such allocations of profits asthey do to allocations of costs.
Profit Margins and Indirect Taxes67. In making comparisons between net profit margins as a percentageof sales and the reference level, due account must be taken of the effecton margins of changes in indirect tax on goods and services sold, sothat the comparison is not materially distorted. The comparison with earlier years should be made on a basis which excludes purchase tax from sales inthe period up to the end of March 1973 and excludes VAT from 1 April1973 onwards. Where excise duties have been included in the sales figures,these duties should be included throughout, adjusted as necessary to take account of the partial replacement of excise duties by VAT.(6)68. Where an enterprise does not already have accounts showing separa-tely the purchase tax element in the turnover of previous years, or whichpermit the precise calculation of the amount of excise duty abatement fromrecords of duty paid, such elements should be estimated on the basis of thebest available information. Where total purchase tax can be ascertained frompurchase invoices this total can be deducted from tax inclusive sales. where such purchase invoices are not available, the purchase tax element may beestimated by applying to the value of purchases of goods charged to different rates of purchase tax appropriate factors derived from those rates. ThePrice Commission will publish information on the application of estimatingmethods for this purpose.Modified Base Period for Profit Margin Calculation69. Where an enterprise has traded for less than 5 complete years of account, or has traded at a loss in one or more of the last 5 years, the reference level for paragraph 61 may be calculated as follows:  (i) if there have been 4 years of trading, the average of the best 2;if 3 or 2 years, the best year;(ii) if there have been less than 2 years of trading the limitation on profit margins will not apply;(iii) any year in which an enterprise made a loss may be treated as equivalent to a year of no trading and sub-paragraphs (i) and(ii) may be applied accordingly.70. For a new enterprise formed from a reconstruction or amalgamation of existing enterprises the reference level will be calculated as defined inparagraph 61 by using the aggregate net trading profits of the constituententerprises expressed as a percentage of their aggregate sales. The same prin-ciples may be applied to an amalgamation of partnerships.71. Where the Commission are satisfied that the reference level of an enterprise, calculated as in paragraph 61 or 69, requires modification, forexample because of a substantial reconstruction of the enterprise during the base period, or a substantial change in the character of its business, they
may agree or stipulate a modified reference level which in their judgementgives effect to the principles of paragraphs 61 to 70 and paragraphs 72 and73.Relief for Low Profits72. Where die net profit margin calculated as described in paragraph61, 69 or 70 represents a return on capital of less than 5 per cent., the enterprise concerned may calculate the level of net profit needed to produce a return of 5 per cent, on capital and may treat the corresponding net profit margin as its reference level. &quot;Capital&quot; means the net assets employedexcluding any part of them which is represented by borrowings the interest on which is deducted in arriving at net profit as defined in paragraph 62.73. At the option of the enterprise paragraph 72 may be read as referring to a net profit margin of 1 per cent, on turnover rather than to a 5 per cent,return on capital.Investment74. Where the Commission are satisfied that in a particular case it isnecessary in order to encourage or ensure investment to modify the appDca-tion of the limits on allowable cost increases or on profit margins, they maypermit some departure from those limits. In deciding whether, and to what extent, to permit such a departure the Commission should have regard tothe following criteria:  (i) whether there is satisfactory evidence that if this is done the investment will take place; and(ii) whether the application of the limits would:  (a) deprive the enterprise of funds essential for investment which it could not reasonably be expected, or would not beable, to raise in some other way; or(b) reduce the prospective rate of return on the investment toa level which would deter the enterprise from undertaking it;or(iii) whether there is satisfactory evidence that the enterprise hadabsorbed cost increases to an exceptional degree as a result of voluntary price restraint and in consequence had significantly reduced profit margins in the twelve months ending 30 September1972.Particular Sectors75. The paragraphs which follow deal with the application of this Partof the Code to certain important sectors. Unless there is express provision tothe contrary in those paragraphs, however, paragraphs 16 to 74 must betaken as applying to all enterprises.
Manufacturing and Mining76.  Paragraphs 16-74 above apply in their entirety.Distribution77. In the determination of prices for sales within the United Kingdom,wholesalers, retailers and other enterprises engaged in distribution should ensure that their gross percentage margins do not exceed the level of the gross percentage margin in either(i) the last complete account year of the enterprise ending on or before 30 April 1973; or(ii) a twelve-month period ending between 30 October 1972 and 30April 1973 for which separate accounts are or can be madeavailable,less in either case an appropriate reduction for the abolition of SET. Forall the purposes of the Code &quot;gross percentage margin&quot; means theaggregate difference between the cost to the distributor of the goods hesells in a period and the value of his sales in that period, expressed as a percentage of the sales value. The difference should be calculated accordingto the normal accounting practice consistently applied by the enterprise. in arriving at sales and costs of sales, indirect taxes should be treated on thesame basis as for calculating net profit margins in paragraph 67.78. The provisions of the Code relating to allowable cost increases donot apply to enterprises engaged in distribution.Distributors&apos; Stocks79. In most cases prices determined by distributive enterprises will haveto take account of the cost of goods drawn from stock for sale. Such enter-prises should adhere to the practice they have followed consistently forpricing purposes in arriving at such costs and at the relevant gross per-centage margins.Distributors making a loss80. Where an enterprise engaged in distribution is making a loss, it may increase prices to cover its costs, notwithstanding the limitation on gross percentage margins.Profit margins in distribution81. Where a distributors net profit margin has exceeded the referencelevel, or where in the light of interim accounts or other evidence that level is likely, after taking account of seasonal or other distorting factors, to be exceeded, price reductions should be made. The reductions should be suffi-
cient to eliminate the actual or anticipated excess over the reference level as scon as reasonably possible, and to offset any excess which has alreadyarisen in a period subsequent to 30 April 1973. Reductions are however notrequired in respect of any excess arising in the period up to 30 April 1973.82. Where the costs of any goods to wholesalers or retailers rise particu-larly sharply (that is to say, substantially out of line with the generalmovement in the price level), the Commission may: (i) consult any body or person whom they regard as representativeof enterprises affected by the rise in costs and take into accountinformation supplied by them; and(ii) having regard to the situation of the product group as a whole and to the volume of trade, consider whether the maintenanceof existing gross percentage margins would disproportionatelyincrease the profit margin on those goods; and whether the tradepractice affecting the margins on the products in question there-fore requires modification; and(iii) issue guidance on the form which they consider any requiredmodification should take.Agriculture83. Part I of the Code does not apply to agricultural enterprises engagedin the production and sale of unprocessed agricultural produce. Where suchenterprises are engaged in manufacturing or processing, however, their prices are controlled by reference to allowable cost increases and net profit margins.Where they are engaged in distribution, their prices are controlled by refer-ence to gross percentage margins and net profit margins.Nationalised Industries84.  Paragraphs 85 to 87 apply to the following nationalised industries:  National Coal board electricity CouncilArea Electricity BoardsCentral Electricity Generating board north of Scotland Hydro-Electric board south of Scotland Electricity BoardNorthern Ireland Electricity ServiceBritish Gas corporation british Steel corporation post office British Airways board british Airports authority british Railways board british Transport Docks board british Waterways Board85. Part I of the Code applies to the nationalised industries listed inparagraph 84, according to the nature of the business of the industry, as it applies to private sector undertakings. However: 
(i) a nationalised industry, when in deficit, may not increase prices by more than allowable cost increases, except to the extent necessary to avoid an increase in its deficit in the financial year in question;(ii) paragraph 60(i) will not apply to a nationalised industry in deficit, but the other provisions relating to private sector enter-prises making a loss will apply, including in particular paragraph60(ii) and the exemption from the productivity deduction; and(iii) paragraph 74 will not apply.86. Where the responsible Minister notifies the Commission that a price increase resulting from the application of paragraph 85 would have an unacceptable effect on the general level of prices, the Commission will limit the permitted price increase to the amount specified as acceptable by theMinister, but not so as to reduce the increase below what is needed to reflect the allowable cost increases of the industry.87. The application of the Code is subject to paragraph 88 in the caseof the National Coal Board and to paragraphs 88 and 89 in the case of theBritish Steel Corporation. In the case of the Post Office and those industries concerned with air and sea transport, it is subject to the exclusion from control under paragraph 19 of charges for international traffic. The pricesof subsidiary companies of nationalised industries, including subsidiaries ofthe National Bus Company, National Freight Corporation and the Scottish transport Group, are governed by paragraph 91(ii). The prices charged for electricity by Area Electricity Boards and the Scottish Boards will be subjectto the provisions of the Code applying to manufacturers.Coal and Steel88. Prices charged by producers for coal, coal-based solid fuels, andmost iron and steel products are outside the scope of the control by virtueof paragraph 19(ii). They are subject to international obligations throughUnited Kingdom membership of the European Coal and Steel CommunityO-Prices of non-ECSC iron and steel products are controlled like those ofother manufactured products. Prices of coal merchants and iron and steelmerchants in the United Kingdom will be subject to the control on gross percentage margins and net profit margins applied to wholesaling andretailing enterprises.89. Enterprises which produce both ECSC and non-ECSC iron and steel products will be subject to price control on the latter only. Where a non-ECSC product is made from an ECSC product, an increase in the price paid for the ECSC product will constitute an allowable cost increase. Where thenon-ECSC product is made from an enterprise^ own ECSC product, the price at which the enterprise offers the ECSC product for sale (or, if it does not offer it for sale, the prevailing market price in a comparable transaction)should be used in calculating any allowable cost increase. In such conversion
cases the profits from converting ECSC products into the final non-ECSCproducts should be brought into the calculation of net profit margins, but notthe profit attributable to the manufacture of the ECSC product.Other Public Sector Trading Enterprises90. The Commission will apply to proposals for price increases whichare referred to them by Government Departments engaged in substantialtrading operations the same principles as to proposals by the nationalised industries.91. The Code applies to the prices of the following enterprises, accordingto the nature of the business of the undertaking, as it applies to the prices ofprivate sector enterprises: (i) trading services of local authorities^), local authority joint boards, public utility undertakings and other similar public sector undertakings (not being nationalised industries); and(ii) companies registered under the Companies Acts which are whollyor partly owned by Her Majesty&apos;s Government, or by a national-ised industry.Water Undertakings92. Statutory water undertakers, whether public or private, are subjectto limitations on deficits, on surpluses or profits, on profit distributions andon borrowing. They are also required by statute to provide an adequate supplyof water. Their water rates and charges are already controlled to a largeextent through these limitations. They will be required to comply with theprinciples of the Code and in particular with the paragraphs relating toallowable cost increases, but not so as to conflict with their statutory obligations.Services93. In general, paragraphs 16 to 74 of the Code apply to the pricesof service enterprises as they apply to those of manufacturers, so that thesystem of allowable cost increases and the limitation on net profit marginsper unit of sales or turnover apply to them. There will be an offset to allow-able cost increases as a result of the abolition of Selective Employment Taxfor service enterprises where this has hitherto been paid without refund.Paragraphs 46 to 49 permit the Price Commission to calculate averageallowable cost increases for certain small service enterprises where the cir-cumstances are appropriate. Paragraph 73 would permit service enterpriseswith low profits to calculate their reference level for the limit on net profit margins by reference either to turnover or capital employed. The following paragraphs deal with the application of the Code to some particular servicesectors, and explain any modifications of the general principles which applyto them.
Banks, Finance Houses and Similar Enterprises94. Most banks, finance houses and similar financial enterprises are engaged partly in business for which the charge is a rate of interest and partlybusiness for which the charge is of a different nature. Interest charges are not within the control. The other charges of these enterprises are subject tocontrol. It will therefore be necessary to allocate costs and profits betweenthe two classes of business for the purpose of the control on non-interest charges. Paragraph 43 applies.95. For the purposes of the Code the enterprises described in paragraph94 may treat as goods and services exported:  (i) transactions in sterling with any person or body corporate resi-dent outside the United Kingdom; and(ii) dealings in foreign currencies.96. The provisions of the Code relating to allowable cost increases andto the limitation on net profit margins, defined in the case of these enterprisesas in paragraphs 98 and 99, apply to their non-interest charges. These includecommissions, fees and all similar charges. Where ad valorem rates are changed and these rates are charged generally, they must be treated asmaxima and may not be increased without the agreement of the price commission, which will apply to them the provisions relating to allowable cost increases. Enterprises will, however, be free to adjust their rates to match the credit status of a client provided such adjustments are in accord-dance with normal practice in such cases. In calculating charges these enter-prises should take fully into account all factors including customers&apos; balanceswhich enter the costing of the class of transaction for which the charge ismade. They should treat changes in those factors as the basis for increasesor reductions in the charges in accordance with the Code.97. The provisions of the Code will apply in full to charges in hire pur-chase, conditional sale and plant and machinery leasing agreements. Changesin the monthly Finance Houses Base Rate may be taken as the measure of increases or reductions in interest costs for the calculation of allowable cost increases, provided that rate is used consistently for all the purposes of the code.98.   For the purposes of paragraph 61 &quot;net profit margin&quot; means: (i) in the case of enterprises undertaking hire purchase, conditionalsale or plant and machinery leasing contracts, where either thegreater part of the business of the enterprise consists of such con-tracts, or separate accounts can be produced for such contracts,net income from charges for this business less associated costs,including overheads, expressed as a proportion of averageresources employed.(ii) in the case of all other enterprises of the kind described in para-graph 94 net income from charges (that is, gross income lesscosts, including associated overheads) expressed as a percentageof gross income (that is, total income from the transactionsconcerned).
99. In comparing net profit margins, as defined in paragraph 98, withthe reference level, account should be taken of the total profitability of thenon-interest business of the enterprise concerned in determining the permittedlevel of charges.Construction100. In determining prices for construction contracts enterprises shouldhave regard to the Code as it applies to manufacturing enterprises. Of par-ticular relevance to construction are paragraph 56, which applies to tenders for construction work to the extent that they are at fixed prices, and para-graph 57 which applies to variation of price clauses in construction contracts.Transport101. The Code applies to transport undertakings as it does to other service enterprises. Charges for international freight and passenger trafficare outside the control under paragraph 19(vi). Charges of nationalisedtransport undertakings, passenger transport authorities, local authoritytransport undertakings and transport companies owned by nationalised industries and their subsidiaries are governed by paragraphs 84 to 87 and 91.102. Charges of private road haulage undertakings are subject to theprovisions relating to allowable costs and to the limitations on net profit margins.Vehicle Sales and Services103. Charges for repair, maintenance and servicing of vehicles are subjectto the provisions relating to allowable costs and to the limitation on net profit margins.104. The prices of vehicles sold by distributors, whether new or second-hand, are subject to the limitations on gross percentage margins and on net profit margins.105. Paragraph 27 applies to enterprises which both sell and maintainvehicles.Hotels and Catering Enterprises106. What is said in paragraph 93 applies to these enterprises also, inrespect both of charges for food and drink and for accommodation.Professional or other Services107. Fees and charges for professional or other services by firms or by individuals who are self-employed are governed as prices by Part I. In
general, what is said in paragraph 93 applies to them. The pay of profes-sional staff who are employees is however governed by Part H, as is the remuneration from public funds of doctors and dentists.108. Where scales or rates of charges of general application, whethercalculated per item, at an hourly rate or ad valorem, are in use in aprofession under instructions or advice issued by a professional organisation,those scales or rates must be treated as maxima and may not be increasedwithout the agreement of the Commission. Where rates above scale havenormally been agreed and have become normal charges, such rates neednot be reduced but the margin by which such rates exceed the scale maynot be increased. The Commission will apply the provisions relating toallowable cost increases to increases in scales or rates and those provisionswill also apply to increases in fees calculated on a time basis.109. Where there aro no scales or rates of.general application, the rates or scales charged for a professional service may not be increased except to reflect increases in allowable costs. Increases in labour costs under para-graph 37(ii)(tf) may not include any element in respect of proprietors&apos; orpartners&apos;, as distinct from employees&apos;, time.110. The limitation on net profit margins will apply to profits of firms or individuals providing professional or other services irrespective of themethod by which fees are determined. Where the number of partners in a professional practice has changed as a result of the substitution of a partnerfor an employee, or of an employee for a partner, the reference level may berecalculated by reference to the changed number of partners. The same prin-ciple may be applied to an amalgamation of partnerships. In applying theprovisions relating to allowable cost increases to scales or rates of charges the Commission will have regard to profit margins in the profession generally and will apply paragraph 63 as necessary.Non-profit-making Organisations111.  Subscriptions charged by organisations which:  (i) exist for religious, charitable, educational, representational orrecreational purposes; and(ii) are non-profit-making; and(iii) do not carry on a trade or business as their main activity,will not be controlled.112. The Code will not apply to prices charged by an organisation satis-fying the tests in paragraph 111, or by any properly authorised person acting on behalf of that organisation, if they are charged in order to raise funds forthe purposes of the organisation, and involve no substantial or continuingcompetition with trading enterprises.
113. Except where they are outside the control under paragraph 112,prices charged in any trading activity carried on by an organisation whichmeets the requirements of paragraph 111 are governed by the Code, unlessthe customers of the trading activity are confined to members of theorganisation.
PART II: pay general Principles114.  The general principles relating to pay are:  (i) to limit the rate of increase in pay in money terms to a levelmore in line with the growth of national output, so as pro-gressively to reduce the rate of cost and price inflation and improve the prospects of sustained faster growth in real earnings;(ii) to apply the limit fairly, irrespective of the form of any increase or the method of determining it;(iii) to facilitate an improvement in tho relative position of the low paid;(iv) to leave to those who normally determine pay decisions on theamount, form and distribution of increases within the limit.Field of Application115.  Part II of the Code applies to:  (i) all pay including wages and salaries at whatever level, allow-ances, payments by results, payments in kind, fringe benefits and lump sums;(ii) all methods of determining pay whether at national, local, plantor any other level; and whether determined by collective bar-gaining, by arbitration, by statutory wage fixing bodies, on an individual basis, or by other means; and(iii) all types of employment (except self-employment covered inPart I); and to both full-time and part-time employees in whatever size of undertaking.All those concerned with the determination of pay should have regard tothe Code.116. Throughout the Code &quot;pay&quot; means remuneration (except self-employment incomes covered in Part I), including other terms and condi-tions of employment.117. References throughout the Code to &quot;settlements&quot; include references to the determination of pay by any method.118. Where the Code refers to a group, the group will normally be thesame as that used for the purpose of determining pay in the preceding 12months. It will, however, remain open to those concerned to vary the corn-position of their groups. Where pay is fixed on an individual basis, the Codeapplies to the individual as to the group.Intervals between Increases119. No group may receive an increase in pay under a settlement made after 6 November 1972 less than 12 months after the group last receiveda principal increase.
120.  Paragraph 119 does not apply where:  (i) an earlier date for such an increase was specified (other thanby reference to changes in indices or rates of pay for other groups) in a previous settlement made before 6 November1972; or(ii) the last increase was deferred as a result of the standstill underthe White Paper (Cmnd. 5125), in which case the 12 monthsmay count from the date from which the last increase wouldhave operated but for the standstill.121. Pay increases which consist solely of one or more improvementsof the kind described in paragraph 135, 137, or 139, are not principalincreases for the purpose of paragraph 119.The Pay Limit122. The pay limit for a group represents the maximum amount bywhich the average pay per head of the group may be increased in a 12-month period. This amount is the sum of(i) 4 per cent, of the average pay bill per head of the group forthe preceding 12-month period; and(ii)  1 per week per head.A precise method of calculation is set out in paragraph 129. If insuffi-cient information is available for this, the best available alternative methodshould be used: examples are given in paragraph 130. Those concerned willbe responsible for satisfying the Pay Board, if required, that the methodused is the best available.123. Subject to the individual limit in paragraph 133, it will be fornegotiators and others concerned with pay determination to decide on theamount and distribution of increases within the pay limit, and on the division between increases in wages or salaries and improvements in other conditions of service. They should, however, have full regard to the objec-tive of improving the relative position of the low-paid.124. The pay limit applies to the 12 months following the first increaseafter 6 November 1972 which counts against the pay limit. But where a group in accordance with paragraph 120(ii) wishes to return to its normaloperative date, so that its settlement runs for less than 12 months, the limitwill apply to the period of the settlement at the weekly or monthly rate thatwould have applied had the settlement been for 12 months.125. The pay limit applies to the total of all pay increases for the group,other than those specifically exempted by other paragraphs of this Code,in respect of the 12-month period in question, irrespective of whether theyare paid during that period or at a later date.126.  In calculating the average pay bill per head(i) the number in the group should be taken as the average overthe preceding 12 months;
(ii) the pay bill should include the cost of all forms of pay increases which count against the pay limit and should be adjusted to offset the effect of absences from work due to absenteeism,sickness, short-time working or to stoppages from any othercause.(iii) Part-time workers should be counted according to the propor-ition which their hours bear to the standard hours of the group.(They should be counted on the same basis in calculating thesum of  1 per week per head of the group.)127. Employers&apos; contributions in respect of their employees for national insurance, selective employment tax, pension schemes and redundancy pay-ment schemes and (subject to paragraphs 131 and 132) the cost of overtimehours actually worked should be excluded from the pay bill and increases in them will not count against the pay limit.128. With the exceptions specified in subsequent paragraphs of the Code,improvements in terms and conditions of employment other than wagesand salaries should be costed and taken into account in determining whetherthe total cost of a settlement is within the pay limit.Calculation of the Pay Limit129.  A precise calculation of the pay limit should be made as follows:  (a) determine under paragraph 118 the group to be covered by thesettlement;(b) ascertain the total pay bill for that group over the 12 monthspreceding the operative date;(c) deduct payments for non-contractual overtime working, and em-ployers&apos; contributions in respect of their employees for pensions andredundancy payments schemes, national insurance and SET; andadjust to offset the effect of absences from work;(d) divide by the average number of workers in the group over the 12months preceding the operative date.This gives the average pay bill per head over the previous year, less over-time. Next:(e) take 4 per cent, of that and divide by 52 for a weekly basis or 12 fora monthly basis;(/) add  1 a week (or  4.33 for a monthly basis) per head of those inthe group when the setlement is implemented.This gives the average weekly or monthly increase in the pay bill per headallowable for the group over the next 12 months.130. It may not always be necessary to carry out this calculation in full.For example where rates of pay are equal, or nearly equal, to earnings (ex-cluding overtime), it may be convenient to calculate the pay limit by adding4 per cent, plus  1 to rates. The cost of any other improvement in pay whichcounts against the pay limit would then need to be calculated separately andthe new rate reduced commensurately. In other cases, it may be possible to base the calculating on a typical sample period of eg one month or one quarter or on typical sample periods for different parts of the year.
Overtime, Shift, Rest Day and Weekend Working131. All payments for work done in normal working hours within themeaning of Schedule 2 to the Contracts of Employment Act 1972 (whichbroadly includes any hours paid at overtime rates which the employee isrequired to work under the terms of his contract) should be included in the pay bill. The effect on such payments of any improvement in pay will count against the pay limit. For example, improvements in shift pay, whetherrelated to improvements in basic rates or not, will count against the pay limit; as will improvements in night duty allowance where the night duty isa part of normal working hours.132. If there is any widening of the percentage differential between therate of pay for work done outside normal working hours (for example, over-time, shift, rest day or weekend working) and the effective rate of pay forstandard hours(&apos;) (for example if the overtime multiplier is increased fromtime and a third to time and a half), the additional cost will count againstthe pay limit. In calculating the cost it should be assumed that the amountof such working in the 12 months from the operative date of the settlementwill be at least as much as in the preceding 12 months.Individual pay limit133. Increases subject to the pay limit should not exceed  250 a year for any individual. If the individual works part time this limit should bereduced according to the proportion his hours bear to the standard hours ofthe group. Increases which are not subject to the pay limit (for example,increases in this category arising from overtime or certain personal incre-ments) do not count against the  250 limit.Other improvements in pay and conditionsEqual Pay134. Orderly progress towards achievement of the requirements of theEqual Pay Act 1970 may be made outside the pay limit on the basis set outin paragraphs 135 and 136.135. Subject to paragraph 136 an increase for this purpose is outside the pay limit to the extent that, by the end of 1973, it reduces by up to one thirdany differential between men&apos;s and women&apos;s rates which existed at 31 December1972 and which is required by the Equal Pay Act to be eliminated by 29December 1975. Any increase in excess of this counts against the pay limit.136. No increase outside the pay limit is allowable under paragraph 135if any other increase affecting the group concerned has the effect of wideningthe percentage differential between men&apos;s and women&apos;s rates in question.Hours137. Reductions in standard working hours may be made outside the pay limit if they reduce standard working hours to not less than 40 hours a week,net of meal breaks.
138. Reductions in standard working hours other than as provided for inparagraph 137 count against the pay limit. The true cost should be set againstthe pay limit but the cost should not be treated as less than proportional tothe reduction (so that for example a reduction of one hour in 40 should betreated as equivalent to not less than a 2-J per cent, increase in pay) except where the Board is satisfied in the light of the evidence that the true costis less.Holidays139. Improvements in holidays do not count against the pay limit unless they increase the total holidays for any group to more than the equivalent of3 weeks a year excluding:  (i) up to six occasional or public holidays;(ii) rest days taken in lieu of weekends or overtime; and(iii) rest days granted before 6 November 1972 in lieu of a shorter working week.140. Improvements in holidays other than as provided for in paragraph139 count against the pay limit on the basis of their true cost.Personal Increments141.  Except as in paragraph 142. where personal increments:-(i) are part of a pre-determined range or scale; and(ii) conform to defined principles and practice which before 6 November1972 governed the exercise of any management discretion in individual cases; and(iii) do not exceed those paid to individuals in similar circumstances in previous years by more than the percentage improvement in the range or scale permitted by the percentage element in the pay limit,any net addition to the annual pay bill per head for the group concerned willnot count against the pay limit and the increments do not count against thelimit of  250 a year for the individual.142. The following count against the pay limit and against the individuallimit of  250:-(i) improvements in the ranges or scales in incremental systems coveredby paragraph 141;(ii) any net addition to the annual pay bill of a group resulting from thepayment of types of personal increment other than those in paragraph141; and(iii) any element in personal increments which relates to factors notpersonal to the individual concerned, such as cost of living increasesor company profits (other than under a profit sharing scheme as itexisted before 6 November 1972).Promotion and Regrading143. Increases commensurate with greater responsibility may be givenoutside the pay limit to individuals who are promoted or the level of whose
work is reassessed by the application of established procedures and criteria.Where this test is not satisfied any increase in pay counts against the pay limitand against the individual limit of  250. Artificial regrading and changes ofjob specification should not be used as a means of avoiding the provisionsof the Code.New Employees and New Work144. New recruits to existing jobs should not be paid more than thosethey replace or more than the rate paid currently by the employer concerned for the same job.145. The rate for new work should not be more than the current rate paid for the same or most nearly similar work by the same or other employers.Where rates vary in different localities, the rate paid should not be morethan the rate in the same locality.Recognised Terms and Conditions146. The cost of increases to meet the purposes of Section 8 of the terms and Conditions of Employment Act 1959, the Road Haulage Wages Act1938 and similar legislation, and the Fair Wages Resolution of 1946 will not count against the pay limit.(&quot;)Pensions147. New or improved benefits under occupational pension or death benefitschemes which are tax approved, or under comparable schemes not requiringtax approval, and any reimbursement of a corresponding increase in employeecontributions may, unless paragraph 148 applies, be given outside the pay limit.148. Where a change in a pension scheme has the effect of increasing the pay, net of any pension contribution of a substantial proportion of the group of employees covered by the scheme, that increase counts against the payUmit(&quot;) unless:  (i) a revaluation of the scheme, made in accordance with generally accepted principles for such revaluations, has shown a surplus inrespect of those receiving the increase, the value of which equals orexceeds the increase; or(ii) there has been a corresponding reduction in benefits to those receiv-ing the increase; or(iii) the change had been proposed before 6 November 1972.Redundancy Payments149. New or improved benefits under schemes for payments to workers who leave an employees service because of redundancy (as defined for thepurposes of the Redundancy Payments Act 1965) are outside the pay limit,as are benefits which become payable after 6 months of incapacity.(,0) See Appendix.(&quot;) See Appendix.
Profit-sharing Schemes150. Payment under the terms of profit-sharing schemes as they stoodbefore 6 November 1972 will not count against the pay limit. Any other payments or benefits under such schemes must be counted against the pay limit.Share Option and Share Incentive Schemes151. Except as in paragraph 152 no options may be granted under shareoption schemes or shares issued under share incentive schemes. The terms ofschemes under which shares already issued are still subject to restrictions, oroptions already granted remain unexercised, may not be improved.152. If the rate at which shares or options had been acquired by individualparticipants under a scheme operating before 6 November 1972 was fixed or was related directly, without managerial discretion, to quantified criteria bya pre-determined formula, the operation of that scheme on the terms rulingbefore that date is outside the pay limit. In addition the acquisition of sharesthrough any arrangements by which employers facilitate the purchase of shares by employees is outside the pay limit provided that:(i) the shares are purchased at a price equal to their market value (themarket value being assessed without regard to any restrictionsattached to the shares, or to the employee^ rights as a shareholder,which do not attach to all shares of the same class, or to the rightsof all shareholders); and(ii) there are no related loans or deferred payment arrangements.Other Benefits153. The cost of any new benefits and of any improvement or extension ofexisting benefits or other terms and conditions of service will count againstthe pay limit unless specifically exempted in the Code. These benefitsinclude:  Benefits in cash or kind, including the provision of cars partly or whollyfor private use, living accommodation at less than economic cost, etc.Loans at below market rate, eg for house purchaseLunch or other meal vouchersSeasonal and holiday bonusesResponsibility allowancesLondon allowance or other geographical allowanceOvertime and shift premiums (see paragraphs 131-132)Stand-by paymentsLay off and sick pay154. Reimbursement of expenses incurred in the course of employment(including removal expenses) does not count against the pay limit. Whenexpenses are reimbursed by fixed allowances, these may be increased outsidethe pay limit, provided that the increase can be fully justified on the grounds of increases in the relevant costs.
Particular Methods and Systems of PaymentNational, Local atid Plant Increases155. Where settlements or pay determinations for a particular group are concluded at more than one level (for example, a settlement at national or industry level is supplemented by settlements at local or plant level) the total increase for the group for the twelve months beginning with the first increase which counts against the pay limit should be kept within that limit. Paragraph119 applies separately to each level of settlement.156. When local or plant negotiations take place before nationalnegotiations the recommended method of achieving the purpose of paragraph155 is by including in the local or plant settlement an offsetting provisionprecluding employers from making subsequent payments as a result of anational argeement which would result in a total increase in the pay of thegroup concerned in excess of the pay limit. Those undertaking nationalnegotiations should have regard to the requirement that any increase settlednationally, if not offset as above, should be taken into account in any subsequent local or plant negotiation, so as to ensure that the total pay increaseof any group concerned does not exceed the pay limit for that group.Payment by Results157. Increases in pay under a scheme of payment by results, includingpiecework and commission payments, or under an arrangement linked to sucha scheme, will count against the pay limit except where they arise, under theterms of an existing scheme which was in operation before 6 November 1972,from direct and measurable contributions by the employees to increased output. This applies to increased payments arising from changes in base rate,conversion rate or other calculator, piecework prices or times, the fixedelement or from any other change in the terms.158. For those covered by schemes of payment by results who do not benefit from a general pay increase the 12-month period referred to inparagraph 122 will be the 12 months following the end of the standstill.159. For those covered by schemes of payments by results who also benefit from a general increase which counts against the pay limit, account must betaken in calculating the amount available for the general increase of any increase under the scheme which counts against the pay limit. For thispurpose it must be assumed that increases in pay which count against the pay arising under the scheme during the 12 months following the general increase will be at least as great in percentage terms as in the preceding 12months.Productivity and Restructuring Schemes160. Except as in paragraph 161, increases in pay under productivity orrestructuring schemes introduced after 6 November 1972 count against the pay limit.161.  Where:-(i) there was on 6 November 1972 an agreement to implement a programme of productivity schemes, or a restructuring, for specified
groups of employees in which the amount of pay or the precisemethod by which it was to be calculated was clearly specified,leaving only the practical details of application of the scheme to particular groups to be settled; and(ii) the employer or group of employers covered by the agreement hadon 6 November already implemented the programme in respect ofsome of the employees concerned,implementation of the programme in respect of the specified groups mayproceed. Resultant increases in pay will not count against the pay limit.Settlements readied before the Standstill162. Settlements reached, but not implemented, on or before 6 November1972 which provide for specified increases on specified dates (and not by reference to changes in indices or other rates of pay) may be implemented in full and, subject to the requirements of the standstill, from their due date ordates. The requirements of the standstill are that no such increase may be implemented with effect from a date earlier than 28 February 1973; that thereafter such increases may be implemented 90 days after their due dateprovided this is not less than 12 months after the previous settlement;and that no such increase need be deferred beyond the end of the pay standstill.163. Where increases provided under such settlements are principalincreases or have due dates after the end of the pay standstill they will count against the pay limit. In such cases the pay limit will apply to the 12 monthsfollowing that increase. Where the total cost of the settlement within that 12months equals or exceeds the pay limit it may not be added to, unless in ways which do not count against the pay limit.New long-term agreements164. Settlements may be made providing for staged increases at not lessthan 12-month intervals which are consistent with the Code but implement a-tion of the later stages will be subject to the provisions of the Code at thetime.
PART ID: General165. Where the particular provisions of the Code cannot be directly appliedto particular cases or sectors without modification, the Price Commission andthe Pay Board will, in exercising their functions, apply those provisions withsuch adaptations or modifications as appear to them to be necessary to giveeffect to the principles and objectives of the Code.
SECTION 3DividendsAdministration and General Principles166. In accordance with the Counter-Inflation Act 1973, dividend control will continue to be administered by the Treasury, rather than under the Code.The following paragraphs set out the principles which will be observed by theTreasury in the administration of dividend control and, where appropriate,effect will be given to them in the order which will be made by the treasury under the Act at the beginning of Stage Two.The Dividend Limit167. Except as indicated in paragraph 169, a company incorporated inthe United Kingdom will not be permitted, without the consent of the Treasury,to declare dividends for any account year which exceed by more than 5 percent, the amount of ordinary dividends declared by that company for thepreceding account year. Other analogous distributions out of the assets of thecompany will be prohibited, except with the consent of the Treasury. since they cannot be increased, fixed rate dividends will not be subject to control.168. As in the standstill, the control of dividends will operate on declara-tions. However an important difference is that interim dividends do not requirethe approval of the Treasury, unless they are likely to exceed the permissiblelevel for the account year, or to bring total declarations above that level.In general, the control will affect the declaration of final dividends, and forthis purpose declaration normally means the decision taken by shareholdersat the company&apos;s annual general meeting. The Act also gives power to controlpayments of dividends as distinct from declarations should this be necessary.Field of Application169. Dividend control will apply to all companies incorporated in theUnited Kingdom with the exception of:  (i) investment trusts as defined in Section 359 of the Income and Cor-poration Taxes Act 1970;(ii) close companies to the extent that they increase distributions in orderto comply with the special tax rules concerning such companies;(iii) companies entirely in the beneficial ownership of another company or companies (except those in the ownership or part-ownership ofan investment trust) or those companies where ordinary dividendpayments are exclusively inter-company transactions.170. The exemption for close companies will apply only to the extent thatan increased distribution is necessary to avoid a shortfall assessment or anapportionment of their income. Where an increased distribution is necessaryit can be made at any time within a reasonable period from the end of the relevant accounting year.171. Effect will be given to the control for quoted companies by making an order applying the relevant provisions of the Act to such companies,
except for those in the categories mentioned above. The order will specifyin detail the coverage of the control, the basis of comparison for purposes of calculation and other relevant factors.172. Companies other than quoted companies will not be covered by theorder. They will nevertheless be subject to the same limitations on dividenddeclarations as quoted companies and will be expected to comply with them.If necessary, the restrictions will be applied to individual unquoted companiesby means of a notice given under the Act.Calculation of the Dividend Limit173. In computing what dividends may be declared for a company&apos;s account year, the starting point will be the total amount of ordinary dividendsdeclared for the last account year in respect of which a profit and loss accountof the company laid before it in general meeting was compiled. The moneyamount of these dividends may then be increased by 5 per cent, to give thetotal amount of the ordinary dividends which may be declared for the succeed-ing company account year.174. In the case of dividends to be paid after 5 April 1973, the basis of comparison will need to take account of the changes in corporation tax whichwill come into operation on 6 April 1973. The comparison will be between:  (i) gross dividends paid before 6 April 1973; and(ii) franked payments (that is, the aggregate of dividends and such pro-portion thereof as corresponds to the rate of advance corporationtax in force for the financial year in which the dividend is paid) made after 5 April 1973.The 5 per cent increase applies to the amount of the gross dividend declaredfor the company&apos;s preceding account year.175. Pro rata adjustments should also be made (i) to take account of changes of one month or more in the length of a company&apos;s accounting period;and (ii) where there has been a reduction in the company&apos;s share capital, or where a company&apos;s share capital has increased since the declaration of the finaldividend (or its equivalent) for the preceding account year and the increasereflects the value of new cash subscribed or other real consideration. Wherethere has been such an increase in share capital the adjustment should beproportionate to the increase in the number of shares issued; no account should be taken of any share premium where the amount or value of theconsideration received for the shares exceeds the nominal value.176. Normal capitalisation issues will not be prohibited by the order, butan increase in capital which is the result of a capitalisation issue will not rankfor increased dividend.Application to Takeovers, New Companies, etc.177. The order will empower the Treasury to issue consents to allowcompanies to declare dividends above the level normally permitted. Consentswill only be granted in exceptional circumstances, and any application forsuch treatment must be made in writing to the Treasury well before anyrelevant board meeting.
178. It is not possible to specify in advance precise rules applicable to allcases. However the following paragraphs indicate the way in which thecontrol will operate in particular circumstances.Takeover Defence179. Where the Treasury are satisfied that an actual takeover bid situationexists (ie where it is the bidder&apos;s intention to acquire more than 50 per cent,of the voting shares of the company subject to the bid), companies wishing todefend themselves from the bidder by increasing their dividends will normally be allowed to do so.New Companies180.  The two main categories of new company are:  (i) those formed by the reconstruction or amalgamation of existing companies; these will need to consult the Treasury about theirdividend position, and will normally be allowed to declare dividendsnot exceeding the aggregate of the dividends declared in the pre-ceding account year by the parties to the merger, plus 5 per cent.(ii) completely new companies which will not be subject to dividendrestraint in respect of dividends declared for their first two accountyears.Newly Quoted Companies181. Former private or unquoted public companies will not be subject todividend control in respect of the first account year during which they become a quoted company or the succeeding account year.Increases in Share Capital182. Where the control would otherwise preclude companies from adjustingdividends to take account of new shares issued for real consideration (forexample, deferred shares becoming eligible for dividend for the first time) and where this would result in a reduction in shareholders&apos; dividend incomecompared with the preceding account year, those companies will normally be permitted to make an appropriate adjustment.Recoveries183. Companies which have recovered from an adverse trading positionwishing to increase their dividends to the level of an earlier more typical year will normally be permitted to do so. They will not, however, be allowed the5 per cent, increase on top of this concession.Pre-Standstill Commitments184. Where, before the announcement of dividend restraint on 6 Novem-ber 1972, companies issued formal documents to investors (for example,prospectuses or rights issue offer documents) stating their intentions about future dividend declarations, it is the intention to allow such commitments tobe honoured provided the Treasury are satisfied that a real commitment existsand that it was relevent to the actions of the people to whom the pros-pectuses were addressed.
SECTION 4Prices and Pay: Other Controls185. This Section describes how Stage Two will apply to prices, charges and pay in certain fields which are not automatically within the scope of thePrice Commission or Pay Board under the Counter-Inflation Act 1973.Pay of Crown Servants and Government prices and charges186. The Government will apply the Code to pay settlements with whichit is concerned, and will arrange notification of settlements to which it is a party to the Pay Board as appropriate. The draft Code describes in paragraph90 the principles which the Price Commission will be required to apply to proposals for price increases referred to them by Government Departmentsengaged in substantial trading operations. In relation to other prices and charges for which it has responsibility, the Governments general intention isto follow the principles of the Code. In many important cases however theGovernment is holding charges below the levels which the Code would permit.Statutory Determination of Pay or Prices187. Statutory bodies which determine pay or prices will be required tohave regard to the Code. The Government propose to use the powers givenby the Counter-Inflation Act to modify the statutory obligations of these bodies accordingly. The necessary orders will be made at the beginning of stage Two.188. In the case of bus fares and domestic air fares the right of appeal tothe Secretary of State for the Environment against a decision of the traffic commissioners, or to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry againsta decision by the Civil Aviation Authority will remain. However, in determination-ing any appeals Ministers will have regard to the Code and may consult thePrice Commission. Rights of appeal to the National Ports Council againstship, passenger and goods dues will also be retained. In determining appealsthe National Ports Council will be required to have regard to the Code.Control of Prices and Charges by Ministers189. The draft Code provides in paragraphs 19 (vii), (viii) and (ix) and 22that control through the Code will not apply to four categories of prices and charges, which are instead to be regulated by Ministers.190. Prices of drugs (&quot;ethical medicines&quot;) purchased wholly or mainly foruse in the National Health Service have for a number of years been regulated by agreement between the Secretary of State for Social Services and the manufacturers. It is proposed that the prices of these medicines shouldcontinue to be regulated through this agreement, rather than through the code, so long as it remains in force.191. The second special category is prices in certain contracts with theSecretary of State for Defence for warlike stores or services. The pricing of
non-competitive Government contracts in this field is regulated under arrange-ments agreed between Her Majesty&apos;s Government and industry in 1968. these arrangements provide for equality of information for purchasing departments in the pricing process, and for the post-costing of fixed-price contracts. Thereare also provisions governing the rate of profit. In the circumstances of these contracts for warlike stores the Government consider that the best course isto continue to regulate these prices under the agreed arrangements.192. The third category is insurance premiums. They will be controlledunder the Counter-Inflation Act by the Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry who will have regard to the provisions of the Code and in this will act consistently with his statutory responsibilities for the protection of insuredpersons through his oversight of the solvency of insurance companies.193. The fourth category is the price of milk for liquid consumption.Maximum retail prices are already fixed by statutory order, and this control will continue.Banks and Finance Houses194. Interest charges are not subject to control under the Code. However,following consultations with representatives of the banks and finance housesthe following arrangements are being made.195. The Treasury will discuss with the Price Commission arrangementsfor receiving and examining reports from the enterprises concerned on theirnet profit margins on interest-earning business. For this purpose net profit margin will mean net interest income less associated costs, including overheads,expressed as a proportion of average resources employed. If the reference level,calculated on the basis described in the Code, has been or is likely to be exceeded, the Treasury will consider in the fight of prevailing monetary policyconsiderations whether corrective action would be appropriate. Courses ofaction to be considered would include the reduction or elimination of interest on special deposits.Business and Agricultural Rents196. The standstill on both business and agricultural rents will continue in Stage Two, and the necessary orders will be made for this purpose.There will be minor changes in the arrangements which applied during the standstill to business rents to remove certain unintended effects and anomalies.The control will not however be extended to new lettings. Studies relating tolonger-term policy for business rents have been put in hand and the Govern-ment&apos;s conclusions will be made known as soon as possible. There will bediscussions on longer-term policy on agricultural rents with the industry inthe summer.
SECTION 5Procedure and MachineryPre-Notificatiou, Reporting and Record Keeping: Prices197. There will be three different procedures for ensuring that the price policy is effectively monitored and implemented: pre-notification of proposedprice increases to the Price Commission, regular reporting to the Commission,and record keeping subject to spot checks by the Commission. The require-ments for pre-notification, reporting and record keeping will be embodied inorders made under the Counter-Inflation Act. The Commission will notdisclose information which is properly confidential except as provided inparagraph 4(2) of Schedule 4 to the Counter-Inflation Act.198. The requirements for enterprises in different sectors will be definedmainly in terms of the value of sales (excluding excise duties where applicable)in the domestic market during their last complete year for which accountsare available. For this purpose the sales of an enterprise which is part of alarger group will be aggregated in the sales of the group as a whole. Mixedenterprises are covered in paragraph 206. The definitions for different sectors			are given in the table below.				Category I	Category H	Category III	Pre-notification	Reporting	Record-keeping	and reporting			  million	  million	  millionManufacturing,     mining,			public utilities, transport.			postal services and tele-			communications	over 50	5-50	1-5Wholesalers, retailers, and			other distributive trades	 	over 10	0.25-10Services     .........	over 20	5-20	0.25-5Construction       ......	 	over 10	1-10Professional services	National scales or rates	over 0.5	0.1-0.5199. Certain enterprises whose sales in the domestic market are belowthe figures in the first column of the table above, but which have a relativelylarge share, or are of special importance, in the market for particular goodswill be required to pre-notify. These enterprises are being informed that theywill be named in the first notification order.Pre-notification200. Pre-notifying enterprises will be required to provide the data referredto in paragraph 204 at the time of any application to the Commission for aprice increase. The application may be treated as approved unless theCommission inform the applicant within 28 days from its receipt either thatthey will not approve the proposal or that the application is still underconsideration. In the latter case the Commission will give a decision withina further 14 days (that is, a maximum of 42 days from the date of receipt ofthe application). If the Commission decide to modify or reject the proposed increase the applicant will have 14 days in which to make written represen-
tations. If a price increase is approved, it can normally be implemented atonce, unless paragraph 54 applies.201. The Commission will deal with all pre-notifications as speedily aspossible. Where it is important because of the nature of a product (eg certainprocessed foods or other products heavily dependent on raw materials whichfluctuate in price) that a decision is given in less than 28 days, every effort will be made to do so. It will be open to the Commission to make special arrangements for such products.202. Category I enterprises will not be required to pre-notify price increases on every product or service. Provided that the price increases are consistent with the Code, pre-notification is not required where either of thefollowing conditions is met:  (a) Where the product or service is part of a group of related productson which the total sales of the enterprise do not exceed  5m for manufacturing, mining, public utilities, transport; and  2m for ser-vice enterprises. For this purpose, the following definitions shouldbe used:(i) &quot;group of related products&quot; should be the minimum list heading of the Standard Industrial Classification within which the productor service falls;(ii) &quot;enterprise&quot; means the whole enterprise rather than any sub-division of it;(iii) &quot;sales&quot; should be the total receivable income from sales in the domestic market during the last year for which accounts areavailable.(ft) Where an enterprise applies for and receives approval from theCommission for a price increase on a product, and informs theCommission in the application that it intends to make a consequentialincrease in the price of other specified products of its own manu-facture incorporating that product. In this event it need not pre-notify,unless specifically requested by the Commission to do so, price increases on those other products which are wholly consequentialon the approved increase.203. Those enterprises required to pre-notify under paragraph 199 willpre-notify all price increases on goods or services specified in the notificationorder.204. Applications for the Commission^ approval by pre-notifying enter-prises will be required to include information about the increases in total andallowable unit costs on which the proposed price increase is based. Applicationsmay refer to relevant information already supplied to the Commission. Theallowable cost information should be itemised under the allowable cost increase categories listed in the Code. Information on profit margins will alsobe required.205. All enterprises, whether or not otherwise required to pre-notify, mustpre-notify any proposal to increase prices which would not be consistent withthe Code.
206. Mixed enterprises (that is, those engaged in wholesale, retail or service operations as well as manufacturing) will be required to pre-notifyincreases in the prices of their manufactured products where the sales of these products in the domestic market (including sales through their own wholesaleor retail outlets) exceed  50m a year. Mixed enterprises are also requiredto pre-notify increased charges for service activities where the turnover exceeds 20m a year. Paragraph 202 will apply to these enterprises as to otherpre-notificrs.207. Where nationalised industries put proposals for price increases to statutory Consumer Councils, they will notify those Councils in parallel withany notification to the Price Commission.Insurance Companies208. The control over insurance premiums will be exercised by the Depart-ment of Trade and Industry. Insurers who are responsible for more than 90 percent, of the business have undertaken to give notice of proposed increases incertain scheduled premium rates applicable to United Kingdom business. these will include scheduled rates for motor business, domestic fire insurance, com-mercial and industrial property insurance and sickness and hospitalisationinsurance. The period for pre-notification and the associated periods forconsideration of proposed increases will be the same as those applied toenterprises making pre-notifications to the Commission.Reporting209. Initially pre-notifying and reporting enterprises will be required toprovide the Commission with sufficient information to establish the referencelevel for the net profit margin limit including where applicable auditedaccounts for the reference level period. If a firm so wishes because of seasonal or other distorting factors, it may submit a quarterly breakdown of this information. The initial information provided by distributors will in additionneed to be sufficient to establish the base period gross percentage margin.210. Pre-notifying and reporting enterprises will be required to providethe Commission with quarterly reports on total domestic sales and on profit margins. They will also be asked to supply relevant information about price increases since 30 September 1972 which have not been the subject of anapplication to the Commission. Where audited financial accounts are notavailable, figures derived from management accounts may be used pro-vided that these can in due course be reconciled with audited financialaccounts. Distributors will not need to provide information on prices but will need to cover gross margins. Pre-notifying and reporting banks, finance houses and similar enterprises should provide quarterly reports on gross income andon net profit margins as defined in paragraphs 98 and 99. Full details ofthe information to be provided by reporting enterprises in their quarterlyreports will be set out in an order to be made under the Counter-InflationAct. They will however be able to report on the quarters which they nor-mally use for their own accounts. They will be asked to provide reports notmore than six weeks after the period to which they relate.
Record keeping211. Those required only to keep records need not submit them to theCommission except on request, but should have available comparable recordsquarter by quarter of sales and profit margins and of costs relevant to anyprice increases made in the quarter. They will also need to have availablesufficient information to establish the reference level for profit margins. Enter-prises below the minimum level for Category III in paragraph 198 need notkeep records.Pre-Notification, Reporting and Record Keeping: Pay212. The general procedures for ensuring that the pay policy is effectivelymonitored and implemented will be as follows:  (a) major settlements affecting 1,000 employees or more, whether or notin a single undertaking, are to be reported to the Pay Board andwill require the approval of the Board before they can be imple-mented (subject to the initial exceptions in paragraph 217 below);(b) settlements affecting 100 employees and less than 1,000 are to be reported to the Board but can be implemented without the Board&apos;sprior approval;(c) employers of 10 or more employees will be required to keep payrecords in any suitable form from which information to checkcompliance could if necessary be extracted.213. In all cases the information required will be limited to what theBoard need to determine whether the settlement is consistent with the Code.It will include the numbers and categories of employees concerned, the terms and operative dates of the settlement and other settlements affecting the pay of any of the employees concerned in the preceding 12 months; and estimatescalculated in accordance with the Code of the pay bill for the 12 months before the settlement, of the pay limit for the group, and of the effect of thesettlement on the pay bill for the following 12 months. The Board will notdisclose information which is properly confidential except as provided inparagraph 4(2) of Schedule 4 to the Counter-Inflation Act.Settlements subject to Pay Board approval214. Settlements covering 1,000 employees or more (other than thosereached and due for implementation before 8 April which are referred to inparagraph 217 below), will be required not to be implemented until after theBoard have given their approval. When the Board has approved them, thesesettlements can be implemented from their due date, retrospectively ifnecessary.215. A settlement pre-notified to the Board in accordance with paragraph214 may be treated as approved unless within 28 days the Board inform theapplicant either that they will not approve the settlement or that the matter is still under consideration. In the latter case they may say that they proposeto extend the period for consideration by up to a further 28 days. The board will of course give their decisions within shorter periods wherever possible,particularly to reduce any period of retrospection to a minimum and taking
account of the need to give 14 days warning notice of any intention toissue an order or notice restricting pay. This will be made easier if theparties voluntarily keep the Board informed about negotiations in advanceof reaching a settlement.216. The provisions of the Wages Councils Act 1959 and the agricultural wages Acts will be modified so as to require Councils or Boards to have theapproval of the Pay Board before notifying employers of proposals to increasestatutory minimum remuneration. Once the Pay Board&apos;s approval has beenobtained the normal statutory procedure for making Wages Regulation Orderswill proceed as at present.Major settlements reached and due to be implemented before 8 April 1973217. The requirement to obtain the Board&apos;s approval before implemcn-tation of settlements covering 1,000 or more employees will not apply tosettlements reached and due to be implemented before 8 April 1973, whetherthey are settlements deferred by the standstill or settlements for which a datebefore 8 April is the normal operative date. Such settlements must however be reported to the Board, in the same way as smaller settlements (see para-graph 218 below) and will be subject to restriction if they do not conform with the Code. Where such settlements have already been reported to Gov-ernment Departments, arrangements will be made with the consent of those concerned to pass the information on to the Board so as to avoid duplication.Reports of Settlements Reached218. Employers or their representatives who conclude settlements covering100 employees or more, whether or not in a single undertaking, will be requiredto report to the Board within 7 days the terms of the settlement and otherprescribed information. This requirement will apply initially to all settle-ments reached since 6 November 1972 and subsequently to other settlementsas they are reached.219. Settlements covering less than 1,000 employees can be implementedwithout the prior approval of the Board, but will be subject to restriction bythe Board if they do not conform with the Code.Special arrangements for certain sectors220. Orders or notices will be made at a later date concerning certain additional notification arrangements covering for example large constructionsites and the operation of payment by results schemes.Record keeping221. Employers of 10 or more employees will be required to keep for atleast 12 months any form of record from which information sufficient to checkcompliance with the Code could if necessary be abstracted. Existing payrecords will suffice provided they meet this requirement.Special MachineryFood222. The draft Code makes it clear that prices of manufactured food willbe controlled, both directly and through the profit margins of the manu-
facturers; and that the prices charged by wholesalers and retailers for all food,whether fresh or manufactured, will be controlled through their gross marginsand profit margins.223. As announced in the Consultative Document (Cmnd. 5247). a specialpanel of the Price Commission will be set up to deal with prices of food and drink. This panel will carry out the Commission^ functions in relation to theprices of semi-processed and manufactured foods, which will be controlledin the same way as manufactured products generally. The Commission willalso be able to carry out special inquiries into the circumstances affecting theprice of any fresh food.Construction224. As announced in the Consultative Document, the Government pro-pose that a special Construction Panel should be established to consider how the requirements of the Price and Pay Code can most effectively be appliedto the construction industry, taking account of the special features of this industry. The panel will be able to make recommendations to the price commission and the Pay Board, and if necessary to the Government. Theintention is that the panel should include members of both the Board and theCommission and the Government hope that both sides of the industry will be willing to be represented on it.225. Most construction work is done on the basis of competitive tendersand such tender prices will not be subject to prior approval by the price commission. Construction firms with a turnover of more than  10 million ayear will be required to submit to the Commission reports of their costs,prices, turnover and profits at three-monthly intervals. Firms with a turnoverof between  1 million and  10 million a year will be required to maintainadequate records of their costs, prices and profits and to make them availableto the Commission if called upon to do so.226. Firms engaged on or receiving contracts for construction services which are worth individually more than  5 million, and which include clausesproviding for variation of prices, will be required to provide the commission with an outline description of the work, a copy of the contract, the items to which variation of price applies, and where applicable the amount of moneyreceived in payments under the variation of price provisions during the last three months.227. On the pay side arrangements will be made at a later date for notifica-tion of additional information about pay on large construction sites.
appendix the following explanatory notes and examples may be of assistance to those using the White Paper. The numbers quoted correspond to those inserted in the text.(/) paragraph 21The fresh foods and other similar products referred to in paragraph 21 are the products of agriculture, horticulture, forestry and fishing which have not beenprocessed or incorporated in any processed product.(2) paragraph 33Calculation of Maximum Permitted Price IncreasesParagraphs 33 and 34 of the White Paper explain how maximum permitted price increases are to be calculated. Below is set out an example to illustrate how the calculation would be made for a single product where the increase in allowable costs per unit is smaller than the increase in total costs per unit:  	Cost per unit of output		Cost Increase per unit of output		As at 30.9.72	As at date of price increase	Actual	Allowable (net ofproduct-ivity deduction)Allowable Costs	64	69	+S	* 4Non-Allowable Costs	30	30.5	+0.5	0Total Unit Cost	94	99.5	+5.S	* 4Profit	6			Selling Price	100			In this example the maximum permitted price increase isAllowable Cost Increase per unitTotal Cost per unit at 30.9.72This percentage may then be applied to the selling price. In this example thenew maximum selling price is  104.26.(3) paragraph 35(030 September 1972 has been adopted because it was the end of the last completequarter before the standstill.(4) paragraph 35(ii)Labour costs are defined in the International Standard Classification of labour costs and include: (i) wages and salaries;(ii) National Insurance contributions;(iii) payments to pension funds;(iv) payments in respect of redundancy;(v) training and recruitment costs;(vi) private welfare payments;(vii) subsidised services (clothing, transport, etc);(viii) payments in kind.

Goods may be divided into five categories: (a) chargeable to purchase tax at 11.25 per cent, from 20 July 1971 to 31 March1973(b) chargeable at 18 per cent, from 20 July 1971 to 3i March 1973(c) chargeable at 30 per cent, from 20 July 1971 to 21 March 1972 and at 25per cent, thereafter(d) chargeable at 45 per cent, from 20 July 1971 to 21 March 1972 and at 25per cent, thereafter(e) not chargeable2. Where annual purchases of goods can be distributed between the fivecategories, the total purchase tax in respect of previous years&apos; sales may be calculated as follows. Purchase tax as a proportion of the tax-inclusive costof purchases can be found for each of the purchase tax categories by referenceto the following factors:  	After	20 July 1971 to	Prior to	21 March 1972	21 March 1972	20 July 1971Category (a)	10.1%	10.1%	12.1%Category (b)	15.3%	15.3%	18.0%Category (c)	20.0%	23.1%	26.8%Category (d)	20.0%	31.0%	35.5%	48		The productivity deduction for enterprises whose labour costs exceed 35 per cent, of total costs.Enterprises whose labour costs exceed 35 per cent, of their total costs should refer to the table below to find the productivity deduction appropriate to them.
On the basis of annual purchases of goods in each category, the overall purchase tax element in purchases can be estimated. The estimated figure can then be deducted from total sales to arrive at turnover net of purchase tax.4. Example(a) Year ending 31 March 1973Sales  1,000,000Purchases (including purchase tax)   Category (a)  200,000Category (d)  500,000Purchase tax 10.1 per cent, of Category (a) purchases  20,20020 per cent, of Category (d) purchases  100,000Total purchase tax  120,200Sales (excluding purchase tax)  879,800(b) Year ending 31 March 1972Method as (a) but account requires to be taken of different tax factors for different parts of the year.Either (i) divide annual purchases of each category of goods into 3 periods: 1 April 1971 to 19 July 197120 July 1971 to 21 March 197222 March 1972 to 31 March 1972and apply the appropriate factors as in 4(a),or     (ii) divide annual purchases into the same 3 periods according to thenumber of days in each period. The appropriate fractions are: 1 April 1971 to 19 July -     ^36624620 July 1971 to 21 March       -     -366JO366The factors for each period may then be applied to purchases.22 March 1972 to 31 March    -(c) Earlier yearsMethod as in 4 (a) but applying tax factors for the period prior to 20 July 1971.A method for approximate calculation of required reduction of Customs and Excise Dutybefore 1 April 1973.5. Goods upon which customs and excise duties have been abated to take accountof the introduction of value added tax may be divided into seven categories: (a) spirits(b) beer(c) wine(d) British wine(e) tobacco(0 matches(g) mechanical lighters6. Those selling the items in categories (a) to (g) will have been able to claim rebatefor the purposes of the stock rebate scheme on part of the duty on their stocks held at31 March 1973.7. For those who claim rebate related to quantities, the amount of rebate per unit of quantity may be used to estimate the amount of the reduction in duty on quantities
of a good sold in the relevant periods. The sum of these amounts for all categoriesshould then be deducted from total sales, in order to arrive at the base figure for sales in the calculation of percentage margins.8. For those who claim rebate related to value of stocks (ie those who are unableto devise a satisfactory method of estimating the amount of rebate per unit of quantity),the appropriate reduction in customs and excise duty will be one-eleventh of the valueof goods in categories (a) to (e). Rebate on matches and mechanical lighters must be related to quantity.9.  Example(a) Year ending 31 March 1973SalesAssume that in total sales the goods on which duty has beenabated on account of VAT are spirits and beer and thatrebate claimed on spirits was  4.73 per case and on beer1/11th of the retail value of stocks.If sales of spirits wereand sales of beer were then reduction in duty (spirits)reduction in duty (beer)total reductionSales (adjusted for reduction in duty)(b) Earlier yearsMethod as for 1972/3(Ty-paragraph 88The products subject to the rules of the European Coal and Steel Community, andtherefore outside the scope of the Code, are those listed in Annex 1 of the Treatyof Paris.(8) paragraph 91(f)&quot;Trading services of local authorities&quot; excludes Housing Revenue Accounts.(^-paragraph 133Standard working hours are those recognised either by collective agreement or bycustom and practice as being those beyond which overtime payments are made.(10) paragraph 146The legislation referred to in this paragraph gives to individual employees or groups of employees within a trade or industry, or to those representing them, a right to seek improvements in their conditions to bring them into line with conditions in that trade or industry generally or with Wages Council rates. The Fair Wages resolution of 1964 relates to Government contracts. A clause in Government contracts providesthat those contracting with the Government will give to those employed on the workto which the contract relates wages which are fair for the trade or industry concerned and are not less than those generally paid in that trade. The effect of paragraph 146 isto allow improvements for individuals or small groups under any of these provisionsoutside the pay limit. 500,00010,000 cases 150,000 47,300 13,636 60,936 439,064

If the employee contribution is increased (eg because of an increase in benefits) but the employer increases pay to offset all or part of the contribution increase, there is stillno charge against the pay limit. But if pay net of the employee^ contribution is increased so that there is in effect an increase in take-home pay (as a result, forinstance, of turning a contributory scheme into a non-contributory one), then thereis a charge on the pay limit unless one of the conditions in paragraph 148 is met.The principle is that increases in benefits are outside the limit, but increases in netpay are not.
