CP(73) 60 COPY NO gg7 May 1973CABINETTHE ROBENS REPORT ON SAFETY AND HEALTH AT WORKMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. The F-eport of the Robens Committee on Safety and Health at work was published last July.    Its main recommendations were:-a. A move away from the present detailed statutory approachtowards effective self-regulation by employers and work-peoplejointly, with much greater emphasis on agreed voluntary standards and codes of practice.b. The substitution for the dozen or so main statutory enactmentson safety and health at work of a single enactment, which would extend protection to virtually all employed persons; and wouldprovide against risks to the public from industrial activities.c. The establishment of a Safety and Health Authority as asingle centre of initiative to replace the present heavily fragmentedadministrative arrangements.It also proposed that the existing central inspectorates should be amalgamatedto form a unified service within the new Authority.2. The Secretary of State for Employment made a statement in the Hcaseof Commons in July, the terms of which had been approved by the Home and social Affairs Committee (though subject to reservations by some Ministers),in the course of which he said:&quot;The Government are convinced that reform is now a matter ofconsiderable urgency in an area of such great importance to allemployees, and it is their intention to take early action towardsachieving the broad objectives of the Report&quot;.3.        Since then, the Committee have been considering how the Report can best be implemented.    There is agreement in theory on the broad principles underlying the Report, including the proposed consolidation of themain statutory enactments, but not on what is required in practice to give1
effect to them.    There are two separate problems - the functions and scopeof the proposed new Authority; and the extent and location of ministerial responsibility for its activities.    Three schemes have been considered and it has been agreed that the choice effectively rests between two.    Thefirst, which the Committee has designated Model A, envisages an authority with full executive responsibility over the whole field of safety and healthincluding the integration and management of all the relevant centralinspectorates.    The Authority would be answerable primarily to theSecretary of State for Employment but also to other Ministers in respect ofcertain specified functions.    This scheme is described in detail inAppendix 1.    The second scheme (designated Model C) envisages that ministers and Departments would retain some or all of their existingresponsibilities relating to the safety and health of workers and of the publictogether with their separate inspectorates; but the new Authority would havea co-ordinating and advisory role over the entire field, together with executive responsibility for the Factory and some other Inspectorates,and the central initiative on safety matters transcending particular industries.    A scheme on these lines is described in detail in Appendix 2.It must be borne in mind that Model C is a general model permittingvariants in the range of functions over which the Authority would exerciseexecutive responsibility and consequently the Inspectorates to be brought under it.    The variant chosen would be determined by the strength of thecase for inclusion or exclusion of the individual Inspectorates.    Thearguments in relation to each of them are briefly set out in Appendix 3,which is an extract from a report by officials which was commissioned bythe Committee.4. The majority of the members of the Home and Social AffairsCommittee favoured the variant Model C described in Appendix 2, but some,including the Secretary of State for Employment, favoured Model A.5. The main arguments put forward by those who support Models Aand C respectively are set out in Appendix 4.6. I invite my colleagues to decide upon what basis we should seek togive effect to the broad objectives of the Robens Report.    Duringdiscussion in the Home and Social Affairs Committee two possible scheme shave emerged but they are not necessarily rigid alternatives, and weshould not overlook the possibility of some compromise between them.R home office May 19732
Appendix 1SAFETY AND HEALTH AUTHORITY:    MODEL CDKTATEKJ3 I%K)POSALS FOR TJ1E DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES between ministers AND THE AUTHORITYKoto by the Department of employment     The Home Affairs Committee asked for a detailed paper describinghow the general principles of the Robem; Report might be put intoeffect on the linos of &quot;Model C&quot; of the earlier paper by officials.This would moan that Ministers and Departments would retain some  (ornil) of their existing responsibilities concerned with the safety an-&apos;,health of workers and of the public:    but the new Authority would hav-:a co-ordinating and advisory role over the whole field.2     Various arrangements could be worked but under Model C.    Thefollowing paragraphs set out arrangements which would,  generally, be acceptable to Departments which objected to Model. A;    whilst at thesame  time would remain so far as possible  consistent with theGovernment&apos;s general acceptance of the &quot;broad objectives&quot; of theRo 1)en s Report,legislation     An Act would be passed which would:-(i)    unify the existing, legislation concerned with safety aiklhealth matters arising from factories,   shops,  offices,..,-railway premises,  mines and quarries,  farms and nuclearinstallations,  or from dangerous  substances such asexplosives,  petroleum and pesticides.(Notes:     (a)    The Alkali. Act would, not be included in thisunification.(b)    The DTI and Scottish Office consider that rhclicensing of nuclear installations should alsobe excluded as it is part of more general legislation;    but the DE consider it shouldbe included since safety conditions ore attachedto  the  licences and  the installations are subject to  the Factories Act.)(ii)    extend safety and health legislation to virtually allemployment,  and so cover workers in a vide range of premisesat present uncovered   (such as educational and healthestablishments,  research establishments,   sewage and waterworkers,  road haulage depots,  fairgrounds etc);     to coverself-employed workers;    and to clarify responsibilities fordangers to the public arising directly from industrial,commercial  or.service activities;     (Note:    The problems involved in extension to educational..establishments ared :i. s c *i i s s e d  b e.!. o w) ;(iii)    provide for new subordinate legislation made under the Actgradually  to replace the detailed provisions of presentleg.i island t to:;-!-^ W-&apos;-;.-. &apos; f. w   iik-s i x  i   lb&apos;
i    i.      v a. - .     ;   s-   :; /. .&apos;.\ it       i/i     Ministers and the Authority would have their respective safety and health responsibilities laid clown in this unified Act;    and al.ltheir powers in these fields would be derived from the Act.HBSFONSIBILITIES OF MINISTERS AND THE authority     Responsibilities under the Act would fall into two classes:-(a) responsibilities placed on an-individual Minj storage- both forlegal reqiiircments to protect health and safety in a specificarea,  and for enforcement of those requirements:    in thesecases the Authority would have an advisory and co-ordinatingfunction;(b) responsibilities placed on the Authority to protect safety and health both by proposing legal i-equiremcnts to a Minister (or ministers)  and by enforcing them or seeing that adequateenforcement arrangements existed.6     Responsibilities which would remain with individual Mind siersrather than the Authority would include the following(a) Matters concerned exclusively with safety and health in mines,which would remain the responsibility of the Secretary ofState for Trade and Industry.     (Note:    The DTI consider thatthere is a case - though not as strong as that for mines -for matters affecting quarries also to remain a responsibilityof the Secretary of Sttite for Trade and Industry.    The EEconsider&quot; that quarries should be a responsibility of theAuthority).(b) Matters arising in connection with the licensing of nuclearinstal.lcit.ions affecting exclusively the protection of workers and the public f3*0111 nuclear hazards,  which would be the- responsibility of the Secretaries of State for Trade; andIndustry and  for Scotland.     (Note:    DTI. would prefer- that the licensing of nuclear installations should remain whollyoutside the ambit of the unifying Act).(c) Matters caff acting exclusively safety and health in agricultureand forestry which would remain the responsibility of the agriculture Ministers.(d) Approval of pesticides for use,  and  control of their use in   -agriculture,  which would remain the responsibility of theAgrioxiltuce Ministers.7     Ministers with these &quot;sectoral&quot; responsibilities would have powersderived from the legislation to make regulations,  to issue licences,to issue codes of practice,   etc,  for the fulfilment of theirrespon.sibil.ities.    Before doing so  they would be under an obligationto  consult the Safety Authority and to give  consideration to itscomments.    Tho Authority&apos;s function in areas of responsibilityspecific-ally allocated  to these Ministers would be to make  suggestions to the Ministers concerned and to draw their attention to any  actions,or proposals,  or lack of action which the Authority considered not to fit in with the general policies and programmes of the Authority.
SAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE authority the Authority would take over from the Department of Employmentct responsibility for ;natters affecting the safety and health ofox&apos;s in factories, offices,  shops and railvray promises.    As theling Act will apply to virtually all employment,  the scope of t.iaority1 s rcsponsiVj.ility would clearly extend a.l.so to the largo rangliscelloneous premises which arc not covered at all in existingsafety and health legislation.    In those areas of its direct responsibility,  the Authority would also be made responsible forprovisions to protect the public from risks arising directly from industrial,  commercial or service activities.    Statutory regulations would be made by the Secretary of State for Employment (afterconsultation with other Ministers where appropriate)  on the basis of proposals from the Authority;    and enforcement would bo a matter forthe Authority&apos;s Inspectorate,  or in certain cases, for JjocaiAu il) o rl &apos;1 i e s.(i\(.i(.oi    The Educations Ministers have bran concerned that in this rasethe responsibilities of the Authority would cut across their genera?Ministerial responsibility for conditions in educational establishm&amp;nxIf the unifying Act is to  cover such establishments,   the DES&apos; has suggested that the Authority might bo rcsponsib.1 c for &quot;health and safety&quot; of&quot;workers in them, but responsibility for matters which mightbe regarded as ctffooting rather the &quot;comfort&quot; or &quot;welfare&quot; of workers should be placed on the Education Ministers,  who would be responsiblefor requirements and enforcement after consu3.tation with the authority the DE point out that this is a very difficult lino to draw,  and thatin other premises - eg offices - matters affecting temperature,lighting arid  so forth,  are not separated from direct risks to health.An alternative would be for all  safety and. health requirements affect!educational establishments to be made by the Education Minister?; onblue advice of the Authority.    An arrangement of this kind for healthestablishments would be desired by DHSSo)ACROSS-THE-BOARD RESPONSIBILITIES Or  THE AUTHORITY(A)    DANGEROUS SUBSTANCES9     TIiere is general agreement that the present legislation controllinthe manufacture.,   transport,   storage and use of explosive,  flammableand toxic  substances is inadequate in many ways and that new provisionare required,   dealing both with the safety of -workers and the  safety othe public,  to  be applied &quot;across-the-board&quot; by a single Authority,This responsibility could be placed 0:1 the Safety and Health Authority(Note:    The DTI would like to have powers  to&apos;set requirements for theuse of explosives in mines:    ie either sole responsibility or a powerto set requirements additional  to  the general requirements set by theAuthority) .10    For this purpose the Authority would need power to proposeregulations which would apply to manufacturers,   employers or occupiers of premises of all kinds  (including mines,  farms and any other premiseotherwise  excluded under para 6 from the Authority&apos;s field of direct responsibility).    Ministerial responsibility in this field needs to begiven, to a single Minister (who would, of course&apos;1,  consult others concerned);    and it [ would be logical to place this responsibill fcy on minister generally responsible for the work of the Safety and health authority  since the Authority would directly cover a major, proportionof the establishments using dangerous or toxic substances.
(\&apos;,-.!.c:    It has boon&apos;- suggested that Ministerial responsibility forcontrols over the transport&quot; by road of dangerous and toxic substancesshould be  transferred fro:::  the Heine Secretary to the Secretary ofState for tho Environment&apos;.    Whether or not agreement on this can boreached before the legislation has to be introduced,  tho authority should be given power to propose appropriate regulations on road transport of such substances).11   The Authority would be responsible&apos;for ensuring that adequatearrangements existed foj- enforcing such &quot;xicross-the-board&quot;  statutory requirements and for preparing codes of practice and carrying owtadvisory work.    Some enforcement void: would be the responsibility ofLocal Authorities,  as at present.    Other enforcement in minus or farmswould be carried exit by the relevant Inspectorate unless the problemswere so specialised as to demand the attention of the Authority&apos;s staff(13)    OTHER &quot;ACROSS THE HOARD &quot; REQUIREMENTS12   The Authority should be given power to propose regu.1 ations of ageneral character applicable to all employment,  including areas whichwere the specific responsibility of the Agriculture Ministers or theSecretary Of State for Trade and Industry.    Fox- example,   it decs not seem sensible for one  set of provisions aboxit plant or equipment in common use  (eg pressxxrc vessels)  to apply to factories, but for adifferent set of provision;.! to apply to farms or mines.    Nor for thereto be various regulations a Lieut maximum weights to oc lifted by worker^Any previsions about maximum noise levels to which workers may boexposed should apply to all workers in broadly similar conditions.Similar considerations would apply to provisions of a non-technologicalcharacter,   eg concerning joint consultation on safety, or safetytraining.13    Departments with sectoral responsibilities would of course be consulted during the preparation of any such regulations.    TheSecretary of State for Employment Would consult other Ministers before making such regulations;    and in sxtitable cases the regulations mightbe made jointly by the Secretary of State for Employment and ministers with sectoral responsibilities.ADVISORY AND CO-ORDINATION RESPONSIBILITIESl&apos;j    The Authority would have a general responsibility to  advise allWin.iste.x-s on matters concerned with safety and health at work,  iucludirthe direct effects of industrial,   commercial  or service activities on public  safety.     It  should  co-ordinate  where necessary the  activitiesof all Departments involved in safety and health at work..15    The Authority&apos;s Inspectorate would he formed mainly from the pre sonFactory and Explosives Inspectorates.    It  should also have seconded toit for shorter or longer periods some inspectors from the otherInspectorates  (eg mines,   agriculture)  so as  to provide an appropria10range of expertise to assist the Authority to discharge its &quot;across-the-board&quot; functions,  and  to facilitate liaison.

SAFETY AND HEALTH AUTHORITY

MODEL A

This note describes a Safety and Health Authority established broadly on lines set out in the Robens Report, ie on Authority with full executive responsibility over the whole field of safety and health at work (including management of all the relevant central inspectorates). The arrangements for Ministerial responsibility have, however, been worked out in greater detail; and they provide for the Authority to be responsible on certain matters to Ministers other than the Secretary of State for Employment (see Annex 3 HS(73)35.)

LEGISLATION

1 An Act would be passed which would

(i) unify the existing legislation dealing with the safety and health of workpeople and with certain hazards to the general public. (In addition to the legislation covered under Model C, the Alkali Act would also be included);

(ii) extend coverage to virtually all employment and to self-employed workers; and improve control over particular hazards eg dangerous substances;

(iii) provide for new and integrated subordinate legislation gradually to replace the mass of detailed provisions in the present legislation.

2 The responsibilities of Ministers and the Authority would be laid down in the Act.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF MINISTERS AND THE AUTHORITY

3 All statutory regulations would be made by Ministers on the basis of proposals by the Authority (this contrasts with Model C, where individual Departments would continue to prepare regulations concerning safety and health in their particular sectors). Normally such regulations would be put to Parliament by the Minister responsibilities for the general work of the Authority after full consultation with his colleagues concerned (this would be particularly important where substantial expenditure might be needed for compliance). Exceptionally, 

(i) regulations exclusively concerned with mines would be made jointly with the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry

(ii) regulations exclusively concerned with farms would be made jointly with the Agriculture Ministers.


A single Ministor  (r,.resumably the Secretary of State foroymont) would be responsible fornpporir.ting and financing the Authority;appointing the Authority,&apos;s budget and programme of work,answering to Parliament for all the Authority&apos; s activities,except as in, paras 5-7 below, where special considerationsarc Involved.In administering statutory provisions concerning objectionab.1 e$ions from the stacks of certain factories,  as at present dealtwader tee Alkali Act,  the Authority would be responsible to thetarj  of State for ..the Environment.    The Alkali Inspectorate  -cl be within the Authority and would liaise with local authorititheir functions concerned with lu*&apos;v.arclous emissions fro::: fncicriethey would continue to advise local authorities on  1 clean air1matters. - . ;6       Similar arrangements would apply for the administration of safety provisions concerning nuclear installations  (as currentlycovered by The Nuclear In s t til .1 at ton t Act) where the Authority wouldbe directly responsible to the Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry so that a single Minister would continue to be responsiblefor all matters affecting the design etc of nuclear reactors.7       The Home Secretary would retain his responsibility for thesecurity aspects of control over explosives: where its functionsaffected this,  the Authority would report to him.8       The Minister responsible for the Authority would have powerto call for reports from the Authority,to give directions on any matter to the Authority.The Secretaries ef State for the Environment, Trade and Indus!and the Home Office would have similar powers in relation to thematters indicated in paras 5-7 above.9        All Ministers and Departments would have access to members,of the Authority and their staff on any matter which concerned them(Tills would be particularly relevant where proposed regulations orcodes of practice substantially affected a particular industry or service.)PvESPO.\S:(H:n.-TTTES OF THE AUTHORITY10     The Authority w6\ild take over from Departments responsibilitytor the administration of the present -legislation concerned with thsafety and health of workpeople and with public safety as airectlyaffected by industrial activity;  and would be responsible to Minis?;tfor preparing regulations to revise,  integrate and extend the. scopeof the statutory provisions,  as indicated in para 1.
.11     The Authority would ho responsible for seeing that adequatearratsgowoh t s existed for the  onforccmeut of the statutory roqu:iro!:i&quot;i:&apos;ieither through its own Inspectorate or through local  authorities.(Proposals are being prepared to make the present division of.&apos; suchenforcement functions between central and local government more flexible, and simpler for employers.!&apos;)INSPECTORATES12     The Authority would manage a unified inspection service, whichwould include the Factories Inspectorate,  the Mines and QuarriesInspectorate,  the Nuclear Inspectorate,  the Explosives Inspectorate,the Alkali Inspectorate,  the full-time Agricultural SafetyInspectorate and probably some other small Inspectorates.    They wo\il*.be. deployed to form a strong HQ with expertise in all relevant fieldsand a field organisation based on about 3P Area Offices from whichthe various expert inspectors would continue to do a.1 with the K-uttersin which they were best qualified.    Tire Inspec lorali&apos;;- would carry outimportant advisory functions as well as enforccmenltj.13     The Area Offices would be responsible for liaison with localauthority staff engaged on work under the legislation, or on relatedwork.    They would provide local authorities with access  to specialistexpertise and. laboratory facilities.l&apos;i      First lino inspection cn farms would he carried out by fieldstaff of the - Agriculture Departments who would, when visiting farms,combine this function with others,  as they do at present.    In theirsafety and health work these staff would be under the general direction of the full- time Agricultural Safety Inspector attached&quot; tothe Authority Vis Area Office,  and would rely on the Area Office. f.orspecialist advice or assistance.    The Authority would meet the costof the agreed amount of time devoted to this work by the fieldofficers of the Agriculture Departments.LABORATORY AND RESEARCH FACILITIES15 The Authority would take over Departmental laboratory or rescarcfacilities at present engaged primarily en safety and health at work.l6     The Authority would be responsible for establishing and fundinga programme of applied research, related to its responsibilities,contracting with research establishments for particular projectswhere appropriate.
The main arguments by those who support Model A are:(i) A strong central Authority, providing a single point of responsibilityfor proposing and enforcing safety and health regulations over the wholefield, is central to the Robens Committee1s recommendations and is right inprinciple.   Experience in. dealing with actual situations has shown that thepresent overlapping jurisdictions hamper early and effective action and failseriously to give clear guidance to industry and confidence to the public.For those concerned in industry and also for the general public, it would bea major advantage to be able to deal on all matters with one clearlyidentified Authority, which would have responsibility not only for the safety of workers but also&apos;for the effect which industrial processes can have on the safety and health of the surrounding public.   The RobensCommittee strongly criticised the present administrative fragmentation,which they felt was likely to hamper badly-needed preventive work.(ii) It is very doubtful how far Model C would be regarded as genuinelyfulfilling the principles underlying the iRobens Report and the terms of thestatement made by the Government last July.   The Report recommends, forexample, that the Authority should, through the responsible Minister, havepower to make regulations, as part of one integrated set of requirements, notonly about any matter affecting the safety and health of employed persons butalso for preventing i*isks Lo the general public from industrial or commercialoperations (paragraph 291).   Again, it proposes that &quot;the existing separatesafety and health inspectorates for factories, mines, agriculture, explosives,nuclear installations and alkali works should be amalgamated to form a unified service within the new Authority&quot; (paragraph 476).(iii) The CBI and TUC, and the great majority of organisations which have/commented on the Report, favour acceptance of the Robens recommendations fora single executive Authority administering and enforcing unified legislation;
and arc expecting action on tho.se lines by the Government.   Industryrepresentation in the Authority&apos;s management v/ill afford a valuable occasion for tripartite co-operation.    (But see also paragraph 2(vi)).(iv) Model A preserves general Ministerial responsibility for the work ofthe Authority and provides for direction on specific matters.    It alsopreserves the responsibility of individual Ministers other than theSecretary of State for Employment in relation to specific subjects,including administration of the present Alkali Act by the Secretary of Statefor the Environment.   Well-established relations between the AlkaliInspectorate and local authorities would not be disturbed.   As regards advice on policy or other matters, all Departments would have direct access to members of the Authority and their staff.(v) The amalgamation of the inspectorates under unified management wouldbroaden the base of specialised knowledge and expertise, avoid overlapping,reduce gaps and generally strengthen the quality of advice available toGovernment Departments, unions, employers and the public.The main arguments by those who support Model C are as follows(i) It would provide greatly improved co-ordination and unification andwould give effect to the broad objectives underlying the Robens Report, inaccordance with the statement made by the Government last July, withoutinterfering unnecessarily with existing arrangements.(ii) It would secure this co-ordination without extending the functions ofthe Authority too far beyond the sphere of safety and health of wcrk-people.In particular it would hot involve interference with the work cf the Alkaliand Clean Air Inspectorate.   This Inspectorate has functions which are primarily environmental (although requiring in a narrow margin liaison withthe Factory Inspectorate), and it has well-established relations with localauthorities (who have important independent functions of their own in this field) which it would be a mistake to disturb (but see paragraph l(iv) above)
(iii) It would not involve any fundamental disturbances of the relationship between the various inspectorates and the Departments of which they atpresent form part, and would thus lend itself to swift implementation.Moreover, Departments frequently look to them for essential advice on theformation of policy.(iv) Model a would, particularly in relation to agriculture, cause majoradministrative problems.   The Agricultural Ministers traditionally administerfor agriculture those functions of Central Government which, like farmsafety, call for an intimate knowledge of farms, farming problems andfarming practice - including other statutory responsibilities for employeewell being, e.g. wages enforcement and farm training (which is to be outsidethe aegis of the Manpower Service Commission).   Model A would involvefragmenting the present agricultural safety staffs in such a way that the minority would be transferred to the Authority whereas the majority would remain in the Agricultural Departments where their time and loyalty would besplit between those Departments and the Authority.(v) If schools and hospitals were included in the sphere of responsibilityof a powerful unified Authority there would be a danger of pressure for theexisting building and lighting standards to be changed to conform withuniform standards prescribed by the Authority.   This would involvesubstantial capital expenditure, for which no PESO provision has been made.Moreover, there would be problems of divided responsibility for conditionsin schools and hospitals, bearing in mind that the majority of the occupantsare not employees.(vi) Some interest (including, it is claimed, both sides of the mining and agricultural industry) are opposed to a structure on tho lines of Model A -and their goodwill would bo of key importance in successfully developingRobens &quot;self regulatory approach&quot;.   The,CBI and the Chemical IndustriesAssociation have asked that the alkali inspectorates should nor, be dissolvedin a general authority for safety and health at work.
