DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMENMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. The Home and Social Affairs Committee has recently consideredwhat should be the Government&apos;s attitude towards the two Bills seeking toprevent discrimination against women which have been introduced by private Members this Session in the House of Lords and the House ofCommons respectively.    A Select Committee of the House of Lords hasrecently published a much amended and improved version of the Billpreviously introduced there by Baroness Seear.    This Bill is due to berecommitted to a Committee of the whole House on 14 May;  and we mustbefore then decide what line is to be taken by the Government spokesman.2.        Although the Bill has been considerably improved a number of unsatisfactory features still remain - in particular, the educationalprovisions, the provision for exemptions, the enforcement machinery andthe heavy burden imposed on the courts.    Even more important, its basicapproach is to seek to deal with individual cases of discrimination, whereas the Home and Social Affairs Committee considered that a much more promising course would be to seek to tackle general areas of discriminationfor example, the refusal to recruit women for particular types of job or topromote them to the more senior posts in certain occupations.    the commons Select Committee is unlikely to report before June; but there isno reason to believe that any Bill they produce will be free from the defectsmentioned above.3.        It is unlikely that we can prevent the Bill now before the House ofLords from completing all its stages in that House; but the Committeeconcluded that we should decline to grant exceptional facilities to assisteither Bill to make progress in the House of Commons.    The effect wouldbe to prevent either Bill from reaching the Statute Book this Session.This is, however, such a sensitive subject that the Committee do notbelieve that it would be politically possible for us to take this line unless we undertook to introduce anti-discrimination legislation of our own next session,    This should give time for the production of a satisfactory Bill,which should if possible be based on the principle of tackling areas of discrimination rather than individual cases, and should contain well thoughtout provisions for enforcement - perhaps through Industrial Tribunals and1CP(73) 58 COPY NO   0030 April 1973CABINET
the Industrial Arbitration Board - which will prevent too heavy a burdenfrom falling on the courts.    Such a Bill would deal largely withemployment, but the Committee considered that it was likely that therewould also be a need for it to deal with some aspects of discrimination in education and training.    Entirely separate provision might have to be madefor promotional and educational activities in the field of anti-discrimination.I was invited to co-ordinate arrangements for the preparation of detailed proposals.    A good deal more work will be needed at official level beforeproposals could be put forward for final endorsement by Ministers, andafter that there will have to be consultations with outside organisations.4.        When the amended Bill is recommitted in the House of Lords, theGovernment spokesman will have to make a statement indicating our general intentions.    Our detailed proposals for legislation will not havebeen worked out by then and he will have to promise that a later statementwill be made on this aspect.    It is for consideration what form this further statement should take.    The Opposition in the House of Commons mightchoose to devote one of their Supply Days to a debate on the subject of anti-discrimination, but it is arguabl2 that it would be better for theGovernment to retain the initiative so that the statement was made in a form ard at a time of our own choosing.    The Committee invited me, inconsultation with the other Ministers concerned, to give further thought tothis matter.5.        Since our discussion, I have been warned that the Commons SelectCommittee want me, the Secretary of State for Employment and theSecretary of State for Education and Science to give evidence before them.I have been asked to appear on 8 May.    I think that the three of us mu3taccept the invitation to appear, but should do so together.    It would clearly be preferable to defer this for a week until after the Lords Debate on14 May, but I do not yet know whether this will be acceptable to theCommittee.    If in the event we have to appear on 8 May, we shall have toindicate the Governments general intentions then, instead of doing so inthe Lords Debate,6,        I invite the Cabinet to agree -1. That exceptional facilities should not be given in the Houseof Commons to either of the Private Members&apos; Bills.2. That we should introduce Government legislation next session and that detailed proposals should be worked out as quickly as possible.3. That our general intentions should be indicated either in the debate in the House of Lords on 14 May, or when my colleagues andI appear before the House of Commons Select Committee, whichever is the earlier, and that a further statement or. our proposed legislation shall be made subsequently.R home Office30 April 1973 ,
