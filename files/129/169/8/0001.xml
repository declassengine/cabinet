THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(73) 48 COPY NO      6630 March 1973CABINETINTEREST CHARGES ON BUILDING SOCIETY MORTGAGESMemorandum by the Central Policy Review staff. The Building Societies are likely to put up their mortgage rates to10 per cent on 4 April, if the Government does not provide them withsome form of financial aseistanceo  Against this background Ministersneed to decide:i. Are they in principle willing to provide financialassistance ?ii. If so, by what method?2, On i8 Ministers will need to weigh the political and social costs ofan inadequate house building programme in 1973 and 1974 and the effects ofa 14 per cent increase in the net mortgage payments of some four millionindividuals against the public expenditure implications of providing adequateassistance.    As is well known it is always easier to start subsidies thanend them,3.        If Ministers decide in principle that assistance should be provided the Central Policy Review Staff believes the form of such assistance should so far as possible meet the following criteria:a. The assistance should keep the private sector house building programme up to 230, 000 in 1973 and 1974.b. The assistance snould help first time purchasers, who,unlike second time purchasers, have not benefited from the steeprise in house prices over the last two years,c. The assistance should, in particular, help the poorer first time purchasers (noting that this may have an effect on prices inthis sector).d. The assistance should minimise the public expenditureimpH cations.1
It is hardly necessary to mention the impact of assistance or its absenceon the Governments anti-inflation policy.4. Two main forms of financial assistance were considered by theCabinet on 29 March:i. A reduction of the composite rate of tax paid by building societies from 24 per cent to 21 per cent.ii. A subsidy to the building societies, which would cost 10 million a month for each reduction of I per cent in the rateof interest to borrowers.REDUCTION OF COMPOSITE RATE OF TAX5, This would permit a reduction in the mortgage rate of about^ per cent over a year or i per cent over six months.    Without government assistance the mortgage rate is likely to be 10 per cent in six months1time; it is, therefore, only realistic to assume that this scheme would haveto continue for a year.    A reduction from, say, 10 per cent to 9f per cent would only have a marginal effect on the cutback in housing starts whichwill occur if mortgage rates rise to 10 per cent.    The chief advantage ofthis scheme is that it will cost less than a subsidy.A SUBSIDY TO MAINTAIN THE BORROWING RATE AT 8% or 9 PER CENT6. This would achieve the objectives set out in paragraph 3a. -c.    Itshould achieve an adequate flow of mortgage money to sustain a building programme of 230,000 without, however, pushing up house prices.    But itwould help many who could afford to pay a 10 per cent mortgage rate.    Inaddition the public expenditure implications would be very serious, 10 million per month on the assumption that the rate would be held at   per cent rather than 10 per cent.    The cost could be substantially reduced if Ministers decided to restrict the subsidy to one or more of thefollowing categories:i. Mortgages taken out by first time purchasers (400, 000people per year).    This might reduce the cost by a factor of about ten.ii. Mortgages taken out by first time purchasers with lowerincomes.    (A simple but not completely accurate method of achieving this would be to restrict the subsidies to mortgages of,say,  8, 000 or less.    But, of course, this would be of little help to those living in London and the South East),iii. Mortgages taken out by existing and first time purchasersof  8, 000 or less.2
7. There are, of course, greater difficulties in administeringselective rather than non-selective assistance schemes.    Against this one   must weigh the extra cost of providing a non-selective subsidy to theBuilding Societies.Cabinet Office39 March 19733
