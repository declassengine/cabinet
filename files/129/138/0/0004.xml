MS DOCUMENT IS THE PilOPERTY OF HER BSJTANNIC MAJESTYTS GOVERNMENT)C(68) 843rd July, 1966.COPY NO.CABINETBRISTOL - WEST DOCKMemorandum by the Minister of transport at the meeting of the Ministerial Steering Committee on economic policy cn 2nd July (SEP(68) 11th Meeting), opinion was evenly divided between, on the one hand, outright rejection now of the Bristol West dock and, on the other, allowing Bristol Corporation to go ahead with thescheme but informing them that they would have to do so without anygrant or loan from the Ministry of Transport and without access to thePublic Works Loan Board.    I was asked to summarise for the assistanceof my colleagues the main considerations involved.The Case for the Dock^*      The prospects for Bristol(a) The existing City Docks and, to a lesser extent, that at Portisheadare outdated and should be closed, the former as soon as possible,Avonmouth docks are limited In area; no major extension is practicable, and the entrance lock will not accommodate modernbulk carriers.(b) The West Dock, on the other hand, would provide five new berthswith ample backing-up land for port operations, and someadjacent areas suitable for industry.    Its lock would admitvessels of up to 65, 000 tons or so, large enough for the anticipated developments in grain, non-ferrous ore and petroleum product carriers.(c) Without the West Dock the bulk-processing industries adjacent to Avonmouth and employing some 6,400 people would in thelong run (10-20 years) be handicapped.(d) While the port would be suitable for general cargo vessels in the foreseeable future, lack of space might cramp and limit theportTs operation; while it might be expected to retain trade atbroadly the present level except perhaps in the very long term,it v/ould decline relative to other major ports.(e) Labour relations at Bristol are good and the port has handledwithout trouble ships diverted to it as a result of strikes in liverpool.-1-
9 -j3.      FinanceOn Bristol ^ higher assumptions as to traffic and assuming thatcertain other desirable changes will be delayed unless the West Dockis built, the return on the project may be estimated at over 9 per cent.In any case it was argued by Ministers supporting the scheme thatdiscounted cash flow (d. c.f. ) calculations are not appropriate to a project of this sort.4.      Regional Planning(a) The South-West Economic Planning Council made this one of thethree main planks in their strategy for the region,(b) The Severnside study is still in progress, and might show that development in the same area would require further facilitiesfor bulk imports.(c) The development of certain industries will be handicapped in thelong-term if the dock is not built.5.      Political considerationsIt was urged at the meeting of the Ministerial Committee thatrejection of the scheme, which would mean the end of Bristol as a port,would give rise to acute political difficulties.    It would be regarded asan example of the &quot;Whitehall knows best&quot; attitude towards a project onwhich the people of Bristol were prepared to risk their own money.    Itwould be a serious blow to regional planning and could lead toresignations from the Economic Planning Council.    In thesecircumstances we might have difficulty in securing a majority in theHouse of Commons when the Bristol Corporation Bill came up for SecondReading; and we might in any case find it impossible to maintain our decision in the force of strong public and Parliamentary opposition.The Case against the Dock6.      The project itself(a) It is extremely expensive ( 3 million per berth for nothing morethan the dock and lockj  actual cost per operating berth likely to vary from  3. 5-  4. 0 million upwards depending on type, ascompared with  1. 2- 3. 0 million for fully equipped newdeepwater berths in other ports).(b) It can only pay off if there is adequate demand for it for deep-seacontainer services and bulk-importing industries locatedadjacent to it.    The Port of Bristol Authority has assumed thatsuch traffics will emerge, but have given no hard evidence of specific likely customers (other than Bristol City Line who are considering a North Atlantic container service).(c) Avonrnouth can cater, for the foreseeable future, for generalcargo and retain the bulk of BristoPs existing traffic.-2-
(d)    There is surplus capacity for general cargo and small bulk carriervessels in the South Wales ports, now just across the severn bridge and sharing a hinterland.    The new Port Talbofc harbour,which will be able to handle vessels of 100, 000 dwt. upwards withroom for additional berths, is under construction.    The port facilities within the Severn Estuary should be planned as a whole;a decision to go ahead with the Bristol project now v/ouldprejudice future development in South Wales.7.      Finance(a) The National Ports Council estimated the return on realisticassumptions at Zj-4j per cent d, c.f. , as against the normal8 per cent minimum for low risk projects.(b) Most port development projects currently approved and in useor under construction are expected to give substantially higherreturns, largely in the bracket 10 per cent to 20 per cent, withtightly guaranteed returns in the lower brackets, and someprojects giving substantially more than 20 per cent,(c) The West Dock could thus be expected to involve a serious misuseof real resources.(d) The cost will have in one way or another to be met from public funds and represents an addition to public borrowing and public expenditure, and to the public sectorJs claim on resources.8.      Regional development(a) This sub-region is already growing faster than any other in thecountry and is substantially more prosperous than the areas of theSouth Wales ports with which it is in competition.(b) The maximum number of existing jobs which might, in the very long term (10-20 years), be at risk, amounts to about one-quarter of the average annual increase in recent years.(c) The Dock will only be any sort of a success if new and expandedbulk processing industries are attracted to the area, giving ita further general stimulus.(d) While the South West Economic Planning Council may reactadversely if the project is turned down, those concerned witheconomic development in other less prosperous areas of thecountry, and particularly Wales, will react even more adverselyif projects in their regions of greater economic value are held upto make room for it.(e) Looking to the longer term there is no reason to think that theSevernside study will propose a major development of bulk-processing industries on this site.
9.      Public reactionA decision to reject the proposal, while unpopular in Bristol andthe South-West, v/ould be welcomed in South Wales (and by theBritish Transport Docks Board).    Of the four motions/amendmentson the Order Paper, three - one supported by Oppositionback benchers, two by Government supporters - are againstthe project.R.W.M.Ministry of Transport, S.E.1.3rd July, 1968-4-
