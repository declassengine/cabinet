C(68) 96 COPY NO.       0 ^31st July, 1968CABINETLiONDON DOCKS; SHIPS clerks pay memorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretary ofState for Employment and ProductivityAs background to the discussion on the pay of ships clerks in thePort of London, it may be useful for my colleagues to have a short note on the negotiations which have taken place.2.      At decasualisation in December, 1967 the 1,500 ships clerks whoundertake clerical duties in offices and on the quays in the Port of Londonreceived an increase of over 20 per cent in their basic weekly wageconsisting of two elements: (a) the  2 per week modernisation payment which all registered dock workers received on decasualisation and (b) animprovement in the ships clerks7 basic rate in return for certainproductivity measures additional to the general elimination of restrictive practices associated v/ith the casual system of employment.    These brought the ships clerks basic wage up to  21. 1. 8.    The agreement providedfor review of ships clerks pay in September, 1968.3.       The ships clerks have nevertheless been pressing for an increasesince March on the ground that their position relative to dockers (mostof whom get piece-work earnings, whereas ships clerks are time workers)has worsened and that the duties of those ships clerks who work on modern-ised berths have become more onerous.    The two sides reached a provisional agreement last week which provides for an increase of15 per cent which gives a basic weekly wage of  24 in return for a numberof productivity measures.    This agreement, which is intended as an interim settlement pending the wider productivity deal envisaged understage II of the Devlin recommendations, is subject to ratification by ameeting of ships clerks next week.    No date for implementation of theagreement has yet been fixed.4.       The employers have not yet produced an assessment of the productivity gains.    It is not possible, therefore, to say whether thereis adequate justification for the substantial increase agreed, though onthe face of it this seems unlikely.-1-DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS GOVERNMENT)
5.      It will be necessary for my Department to seek a detailed assessment of the anticipated productivity savings and to discuss this assoon as possible with the two sides.    If from these discussions it appearsthat there is inadequate justification for the 15 per cent increase agreed,there will be a strong case on prices and incomes grounds for pressing the two sides to make the agreement more satisfactory.    This case isreinforced by the importance of the clerks as pace setters in last yearTsdecasualisation settlement and the likely repercussions of the presentproposed settlement on the pay of dockers generally in London and inother ports.   I am proposing therefore that my officials should explorewhether the two sides can be persuaded to accept changes in the agreement which would bring it more into line with incomes policy.    If, however, inthe event of their refusing to do so, we attempt to prevent implementation of the agreement, there will undoubtedly be a serious risk of an almosttotal stoppage of the Port of London and of serious damage to exports.6.      We need to decide therefore whether in the light of the Presidentof the Board of TradeTs repoit on the effectiveness of possible counter-measures whether the risk of industrial action should be accepted in preference to the damage to incomes policy which implementation of theagreement will involve.B.A.C.Department of Employment and productivity, S.
