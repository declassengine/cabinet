TRANSCRIPT:   L1CHAEL STEWART / PETER SNOWNEWS AT TEN. WEDNESDAY 21 AUGUST. 1968,*268P.S.    What is Britain going to do about this?MoS,    Well the British Government Is policy has beenfirst to maintain the strength and efficiency of the North Atlantic Alliance.   It&apos;s becausethat alliance exists that many countries, membersof it, are not subject to what Czechoslovakia is subject now.   But at the same time our policy has been to make it clear that this alliance isnot an alliance for aggression.   That we soughtconciliation with the Soviet Union and her allies.   We sought it in minor things, likeconsular conventions, in greater things likepractical proposals for disarmament.   All that work for conciliation is now halted, set back,disappointed by the Russian action in czechoslovakia.P.S.    Are you suggesting that NATO is now going totake some sort of action?M.S.    Our immediate job is to make it clear to thewhole world that the responsibility for thislies on the Soviet Government and that we shalldo in the forum of the United Nations.P.S.     Is that all you&apos;re going to do, Kr. Stewart?M.S.    Well at the5 don&apos;t underestimate this.   There isto be a meeting of the Security Council andalready ourselves, the United States, France,Brazil, Paraguay, Canada, Denmark, all members/of
of the Security Council, are asking for thismeeting, when we shall make clear what the realposition is and where the responsibility lies.In the meantime we must maintain the strength ofthe North Atlantic Alliance.   That?s why theBritish Government recently increased its commit-ment to that alliance.P.S. Does all this moving of the U.N0make any differ-enceiiwhen we all know that the Soviet Governmentwill probably veto any resolution ...M.S.     It cannot make immediate difference unhappily.to the situation in Czechoslovakia.   It can makevery great difference in time on the way inWhich the whole world and country after country which has been trying to decide where itssympathies lay.   They are going to be influenced.P.S.    Is any action going to be taken?M.S.     ... by what is said and done in the united nations,P.S0    Do you think any action will be taken?M.S.     If you speak of military action ...P0S.    Sanctions?M.S.     ... we&apos;ve got to recognise that this is not apossibility.   I think everyone understandsthat.   Action means action to convince the whole world with whom they have got to work If they want world peace.P.S.    What about sanctions?M.S.    I don&apos;t think that arises, at any rate at this/stage
stage.P.S.    Why not? ^       JM.S.    Well you&apos;ve got to look at the practicalitiesof the situation.   Czechoslovakia was a communistcountry within the Warsaw Pact.   There&apos;s not oneto which we were pledged as we are pledged to ourNATO allies.   The terrible thing is that theSoviet Union can treat one of its own allies inthis way.   if it does that, how can they expectthose who are not its allies to trust it?Poo.    Might it do the same somewhere else, might it do this to Rumania do you think?MoS.    Well, what would you give for the security ofany country which is not a member of the north atlantic Alliance and is within reach of theSoviet Union?   This must be the question many countries are asking.   I wouldn&apos;t &apos;t add more thanwhat I&apos;ve said about that.P.S.     If Russia does take this kind of action against another country is there still nothing we can doexcept make a big fuss in the world for thatcountry?M.S.    Well you mustn&apos;t describe it as merely making abig fuss.   Wo have to recognise that our ownalliance has certain duties and powers which itwill rigidly uphold but which it cannot go beyond.Apart from that there is a chance of explaining to the whole world where the justice of this matterlies.P0So    Thank you very much, Mr. Stewart.
