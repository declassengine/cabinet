R.C.A.W.B.Board of Trade, S. W.l.30th July, 1968
SONIC BANGSMemorandum by the President of the Board of Tradeand the Minister of TechnologyExercise Summer SkyLast July, following a decision by the Home AffairsCommittee (7th April (H(67) 10th Meeting), a sonic bangexercise was carried out   over southern England,     Overa period of two and a half weeks, a total of eleven bangswere made (two over Dorset, five over the Bristol Channelarea, and four over the London area).      The bangs were kept to a nominal itensity of 1 lb/sq.ft., which is about halfwhat may be expected from Concorde.     Each bang over Dorsetwas heard by about a quarter of a million people, those overthe Bristol Channel area by about one and a half million people, and those over the London area by about elevenmillion people.     Of this total of nearly thirteen million people, about 12,000 people complained, 9,600 of the complaintscoming from the London area.     Nearly 800 claims for compensa-tion for damage were received, about 500 of which have beenaccepted involving some  3,60002. A factual report on the exercise has now been prepared.It has confirmed a number of points about sonic bangs, viz:-(a) Although one can readily imagine circumstances inwhich a person or animal being startled by a bangresults in an accident causing death or serious injury or damage, the chances are remote - at leastwith bangs of the intensities in question.(b) Although it is possible that a person may be in sucha delicate state of physical or mental health that abang may trigger off his existing weakness, the likelihood is not great.(c) Some damage to property already in a weak state(and thus already in danger of damage from other more usual causes) may be triggered off.   although this risk is not large, it cannot be dismissed asnegligible.(d) Some people are made apprehensive by the prospectof bangs.     Some are frightened by the bangs them-selves.     Many people are annoyed either by theprospect or by the bangs or both.(e) People&apos;s reactions to a sonic bang test are muchaffected by the fact that it is a test. the degree of anxiety or annoyance engendered by a testshould not be assumed to offer a firm guide, one way or other, to the reaction to be expected frombangs from supersonic aircraft in regular airlineservice.Prom the beginning, we recognised publicly that the exercisewas of limited value and that we could expect to discoverlittle new about subjective reaction to SST operations.    its main purpose was to serve as a   pointer to the desirabilityof undertaking a larger scale exercise.1
confidential.     The American authorities have become disillusioned withtests in which the public is ex? osed to sonic bangs with theovert purpose of determining their reaction to them, for thereason mentioned in paragraph 2(e) above.     The French havenever had tests specifically to gauge the probable reactions of the general public to sonic bangs from SSTs;    their work has been a by-product of normal military activity, and they intend to pursue this policy.ko     We do not believe that further tests for the specificpurpose of testing public reaction would be worthwhile.Our reasons are as follows:-(a) Because people&apos;s reactions are so much affected bythe fact that they are being tested, even the mostsubtle use of opinion surveying techniques would be unlikely to give a reliable indication of reaction to regular supersonic operations.(b) A major test would have to be preceded by contro-versial legislation.(c) We could use Lightnings to make bangs as loud asthose to be expected by Concordes, but becauseLightnings are much smaller, the quality of thebang is different.     We might be able to borrowfrom the Americans large military aircraft whichwould produce bangs closer to those of Concordes,but even so  there would be differences.      the concorde prototypes themselves will not be readyto fly supersonically before the summer of 19&amp;9.(d) To be meaningful, further tests would have toextend over a long period and work up to severalbangs a day.      If we could persuade the americans to lend us aircraft, they are likely to be few and available for only a short time.     Making severalbangs a day with Concordes during the next fewyears could only be done to the grave detriment of the Concorde development programme itself.(e) The combination of (c) and (d) means that wecould have tests that represented the intensityand frequency of the bangs to be expected fromConcorde (by using Lightnings) or we couldrepresent the quality approximately (by using an american aircraft)  or fairly exactly (by usingprototype Concordes) but we could not representthe number of bangs and their character at thesame time,,(f)    If further tests were to be accompanied by a social survey, this would have to be based on a fairly small sample of the population, and the tests would have to be confined to a fairly smallarea, because we could not justify exposing a fewmillion people to bangs simply in order to obtainthe reactions of a few thousand selected from among them.     The political difficulty of selecting one small area for intensive and prolonged testingwould remain.5.   Although it is not practicable to direct Concordeprototypes from their essential test flying programme-specifically to make sonic bangs over populated areas,some test flying will have to take place over land atsupersonic speed.     Provisional routes have been selectedwith the aim of causing the minimum disturbance.      Supersonicflying over these routes is likely to start in the  summer of1969 at the rate of about one flight per week.     These flightsmight give some   indication of public reaction, but they would of course be nnrepresenta^^^jCif-the situation to be expectedwhen SSTs were in airliK^We^ftlo^.
6.     Much work is already in progress or planned on what might he called the &apos;physics&apos; of the problem, as distinct from its social aspects, and there are exchanges of informa-tion on this with the French and the Americans.     This willcontinue, but the filling in of gaps in our knowledge of thephysics will not help much in deciding on regulations.     Theimportant problems now are in the realms of politics, inter-national relations, law and the social sciences, not in thoseof the physical sciences.The regulation of supersonic flight by civil aircraft7.     Officials of our two Departments have been considering what restrictions if any should be imposed on flights bysupersonic civil aircraft over this country.   A report hasbeen prepared which describes the nature of the sonic bangand the physical and sociological effects;    assesses the likely disturbance in terms of the number of bangs thatwould be heard daily if there were no restrictions;    andexamines the various types of restrictions that might be imposed, the economic implications both for the airlinesand for sales of Concorde, and how restrictions might been forced.8.     The report recommends and we agree that the fccussedbang at the beginning of the transonic acceleration stageshould be prohibited over the United Kingdom.     This is relatively straightforward.      The more difficult questions are: -(a) what additional restrictions, if any, should be imposed on supersonic flights over the UnitedKingdom;(b) the timing and announcement of our decision.Restrictions  in the Cruise Stage9.      The choice lies between a complete ban on overlandsupersonic flights and the acceptance of some disturbance,kept down to a certain number of bangs a day by distributionof the traffic over a number of routes.     The establishmentof sufficient routes to reduce the disturbance to say fivebangs a day would present formidable air traffic controlproblems, and it is by no means certain that such a  scheme could be made to work in practice.     This can only be deter-mined by a detailed examination with the ATC authorities inthe other countries concerned on both sides of the Atlantic.Timing of a Decision10.    The factors to be considered in the timing of thedecision are:-(a) the need to ensure that the necessary air traffic control and operational facilities are ready bythe time Concorde comes into service and(b) the effect that a premature announcement of restrictions on supersonic flights would have onthe sales prospects of Concorde.11. Officials estimate that it will be late 1972 beforeConcorde enters service and this has eased the pressuresomewhat on the need for an early decision for (a) above.3
OKNevertheless it will take at least two years to instalthe necessary facilities once a traffic system for super-sonic flights has been agreed.     This system has to hesettled internationally and the planning and process ofinternational discussion inevitably takes a long time.The planning also has to be fitted in with the programmeof ICAO meetings and the detailed plan will have to besettled at the North Atlantic Regional Air NavigationMeeting which is scheduled to take place in April/May 1970.It would be prudent to allow at least a year for discussions,prior to this meeting, with our Burocontrol partners and inthe ICAO North Atlantic Systems Planning Group.     There is,therefore, a real possibility that if decisions are not taken by the Spring of next year on the pattern of supersonicflying over or around the United Kingdom the necessary facilities will not be operational in time in all   tiecountries concerned.12.       On the other hand, the effect of restrictions onsure rsonic flights over land cannot be assessed with anyaccuracy without information on the performance of Concordeand its overall viability, (nor can we make a finalassessment of the severity of its sonic bang until somesupersonic flying has been done).    Sufficient flightexperience of the aircraft to enable these judgmeiits to bemade will not be available until the Autumn of next year.An announcement that the United Kingdom were to impose restrictions on supersonic flights, if made before potentialpurchasers has had a chance of assessing the aircraft&apos;sviability, might be extremely damaging to sales prospects.Conclusion13c       In considering the problem   it will be necessary toweight the inconvenience likely to be caused to the public by sonic bangs as against the likely value of   Concordeejp orts.      The object of this paper is not to ask for adecision now but to bring the    problem to the attentionof the Committee and to recommend that, in the light of paragraphs 10-12 above, the position should be reviewed at the end of this year.     By then further informationmay be available about the attitude of other States towardssupersonic flights over their territories.     The matter is,in fact, likely to be discussed at the ICAO Assembly inSeptember.   By the end of the year further information willalso be available on the development of Concorde and on thedate by which it is likely to come into  service.C.A.R.C.A.W.B.Board of Trade, S.W.1.30th July, 1968.
