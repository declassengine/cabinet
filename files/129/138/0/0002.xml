The proposals in the Paper for possible changes in the adrninis-trative structure are entirely tentative.    It is essentially a documentfor discussion.    I have stated in the Foreword that the unusual formof publication, as a Green Paper, emphasises the Governments belief that the question of reorganisation in the health services is one to whichthe opinions of those interested and involved in the service should contribute, and that no decisions will be taken by the government until the views expressed on behalf of the authorities concerned andof those providing the medical and related services have been considered.3,       One feature of the present structure that has been constantlycriticised, particularly in our own Party, is the absence of anydemocratic1 or elected element in the existing hospital authorities.The Green Paper meets this by suggesting (in paragraph 59) that inthe context of the Area Board solution a proportion, say 40 per cent,of the membership should comprise members of the local authoritiesnominated by them.    Such an arrangement would in my view effectivelymeet the criticisms I have mentioned,4,       The draft Green Paper has been discussed by the ministerial committee on Social Services and the revised draft annexed meetsmost of the points which rny colleagues raised, in particular themajority view that some saving for the position of local authoritieswas needed so that the possibility of placing comprehensive health services under local authority management is left open at this stage.5.      I should like to publish the Green Paper as soon as possible toenable consultations to begin.    I shall settle the actual date of publication after further consultation with the Lord Presidentof the Council and in the light of the arrangements for publishing the Seebohm Report.

Administrative Structure of the Medical and related services in England and WalesFOREWORDThe Aims, and Nature of the Green Paper(i) In November 1967 I announced that I was making a careful examin ationof the administrative structure of the medical and related services forwhich I am responsible.     In this Green Paper I put forward sometentative proposals for England and Wales as a basis for wide public discussion and consultation with representative bodies.     TheSecretary af State for Scotland is carrying out a separate review ofthe structure of the Rational Health Service in Scotland.(ii) In announcing my review, I commented that it had been wise toavoid making too early adjustments in the structure of the national health Service which came into operation in 19U8.     It was a frameworkwell suited to the immediate needs, in particular to the reorganisation of hospital and specialist services.     That phase, however, is past.It seems that the organisation of medical and related services, in thecommunity and in the hospitals, has now progressed almost as far as ispossible within the present divided administrative structure.     the response to my announcement showed widespread recognition that the time has come for that structure as a whole to be radically reconsidered.(iii) The proposals in this Green Paper for a new administrative structure are entirely tentative.     The unusual form of publication,as a Green Paper, emphasises the Governments belief that the questionof long term reorganisation in the health services is one to whichthe opinions of those interested and involved in the future of this great enterprise should contribute.     No decisions will therefore betaken by the Government until representatives of the authorities concerned and of those providing the medical and related services havebeen consulted and proper account has been taken of their views..Thought will also have to be given to other services which are the2.
concern of other Government Departments hut which are closely related to those for which I am responsible at the Ministry ofHealth.     Moreover, any conclusions on the future organisation ofhealth services must take account of the recommendations of theSeebohm Committee on the Local Authority and Allied Personal social services and of the Royal Commission on Local Government in England.The Report of the Royal Commission on Medical Education   is alsorelevant.(iv)     The paramount requirement is that all the different kinds of care and treatment that an individual may need at differenttimes, whether separately or in combination, should he readily available to him.    This requires the closest collaboration betweenthe doctors, nurses and other workers who give him their help.    it also requires close collaboration between those who provide and administer the various services to which all these workers belong.The importance of this collaboration is widely acknowledged andI know of many suggestions - at conferences, and in reports andarticles - for the best means of furthering it.   The discussions Ihave had with the Long Term Study Group, whom I invited in July, 1965to help me with broad surveys of the future, have also helped me to formulate my proposals.   As a result of all these things I havedecided that the central theme of this Green Paper must be the unifiedadministration of the medical and related services in an area by one authority, in place of the multiplicity of authorities concerned in the present arrangements.(v)     Great advantages would flow from this unification ofadministration, whatever the precise form of the area authorityU  Cmnd. 3569. H.M.S.O., April, 1968.3.
4.2 3may be.   One form which will fall to be considered is that in each area a new type of local authority, such as may be created afterthe Royal Commission on Local Government has reported, mightitself constitute a suitable committee for this purpose.    Ifthis were to happen a problem would then arise in relation tofinancing the integrated services which would need to be considered.Another form to be considered is that special new local boards mightbe set up, including members of the local authorities nominated bythem, but responsible directly to the Minister,    In order to illustrateas clearly as possible what these new bodies - called &apos;Area boards would involve this Green Paper deliberately sets out to give,in Chapter 3f the kind of details on which discussion would be helpful.   But let me make it clear that this is simply as abasis for discussion and does not imply that any decisions have&quot;been reached as between this form of area authority and another,(vi) Yi/whatever principles are finally decided upon for there organisation of the medical and related services, special consideration will have to be given to their application in Walestaking account among other factors of the stage reached in the evolution of Welsh local authorities.(vii) I wish also to emphasise that if, after discussion, thedecision is to make changes in the administrative structure, andto promote legislation whether on the lines here described orotherwise, the representatives of the staff will be fullyconsulted before the changes are put into force.
(viii)       To sum up, my aim is to reach a clear view, &quot;basedon full debate, of what administrative structure will bestfit these vital national services in England and Wales for thechallenges of the 1970s and 1980s.    There has been widespreaddiscussion of this subject for several years.    This Green paper is intended to focus the debate as the time for important and far reaching decisions draws near.
Chapter 1THE NEED FOR CHANGEExisting Administrative Structure1.     The promotion of a comprehensive health service was theprincipal aim of the legislation which established the national health Service.    The pattern of local administration introduced for this purpose has remained virtually unaltered since 1948.Similarly the administration of the welfare services for whichthe Minister is responsible was settled in 194-8.   The broadfeatures of the structure may be briefly stated.Hospitals2.     Hospital authorities are numerous.    The higher management,on behalf of the Minister, is in the hands of 14 regional hospital Boards in England and a Hospital Board in Wales.    day to day management and control is with 330 Hospital management committees.    The management of teaching hospitals isseparately vested, under the Minister, in 36 Board of Governors,26 of which are in London.   Appointments to Hospital Boardsare made by the Minister;   Management Committees are appointedby the Regional Boards.Health Services in the Community3.     Health care in the local community is a dividedresponsibility.   Medical care is for the most part providedby family doctors.    These doctors, as well as dentists,opticians and pharmacists, are in contract with executive councils.    The members of the 134 Councils are appointed&apos;bythe Minister, by the local health authorities and by the professions.4.     The 175 local health authorities 0) provide generalsupportive services.   These cover medical, dental and other services for mothers end young children in ante-natal, post-natal and child health clinics;    domiciliary midwifery;   homenursing and health visiting;    vaccination and immunisation;home helps;    the ambulance service;    services for the mentally ill and the mentally handicapped including training centres andhostels;   family planning;   health education;    the provisionof nursing items;    recuperative care;    chiropody;    and other measures for the prevention of illness, or the care and after-care of those who are ill.   Many local authorities have health centres at which by arrangement with Executive Councils and hospital Boards a range of services are provided.    some services are provided by arrangement with voluntary organisations.Welfare services.     Local authorities provide welfare services under theNational Assistance Act, 1948.    U ) These consist of residential services for the elderly, infirm and handicapped,temporary accommodation for the homeless and welfare servicesf o^ the elderly and handicapped.    Many of those who need thesesocial services also need the services of doctors, nurses andother health workers, though perhaps only from time to time.6.
A variety of administrative arrangements exist:    in mostauthorities there is a separate welfare committee and chiefwelfare officer;    in about one third there are joint health and welfare committees, though in some of these thedepartmental organisation is separate.Other services.     Local authorities have other functions, perhaps lesspersonal hut no less important and requiring medical and related professional skills.   These functions include foodhygiene and the prevention of spread of infectious diseases(mainly functions of County Borough and District Councils)and the registration of nurseries, of nursing homes, andof homes for the disabled, the elderly and the mentallydisordered (carried out by County and County borough councils).   Certain authorities are responsible for healthcontrol at seaports and others at airports.The ftripartite&apos; structure7.     The three main groups of services - under executive councils, hospital authorities and local authorities - are often referred to as the &apos;tripartite&apos; structure, but thisis a simplification.   Hospital authorities themselves are ofthree kinds and their interrelations are complex.    The majorlocal authorities are both local health authorities andlocal welfare authorities, and some important healthfunctions are carried out by other local authorities.    Thereare two systems of finance:    the hospital and ExecutiveCouncil services are financed (apart from receipts fromcharges) from taxes and the National Health service contribution;   the local authority health and welfare services on the other hand are paid for (again apart fromreceipts from charges) from rates, though with substantialExchequer help through the rate support grant.    The numbers and size of the main authorities are given below C2) 0Footnotes(D Local health and welfare authorities are thecounty councils, county borough councils, the Londonborough councils, and the Common Council of the City ofLondon.    Some 30 borough and district councils also carryout certain personal health and welfare functions bydelegation.   Borough and district councils also have welfarefunctions in providing meals and recreation for old people.In London, the ambulance service is a function of theGreater London Council.(2)See below.7.

Present Performance and Future Challenge8.     Within the framework laid down by the existing legislation,services have been developed and strengthened,  and new patterns of care introduced.    In the general medical services, grouppractice has been considerably extended and in many placesthere is now a confident move towards practice from health centres.   Local authorities are steadily developing and improving their health services, though over the country as a whole the published development plans of local authorities show widevariations &quot;between different areas in standards of service, bothactual and planned,   A major achievement of the planning of thehospital service has been to provide specialist care moreevenly over the country, with improved facilities and the building up, and better location, of specialist staffs.   A very large programme of hospital renewal - one of the largest building programmes in the whole public sector -   is now under way, andits results are increasingly evident;   by the 1970s annual expenditure on new hospital &quot;building should be well above 100 million.    This momentum needs to be maintained in all threebranches of the services.9.     Within the ftripartite&apos; structure the authorities seek toco-ordinate the provision of services.    Hospitals, with theirelaborate and expensive clinical facilities, are most effectivelyplanned and used if full account is taken of the other health and welfare facilities and of the plans for developing them.    Thevalue of area planning is increasingly understood.    Theassociation of local authority staff with general medical practice is rapidly extending.    In some places there are novelschemes requiring close co-operation;    for example, area plans are being drawn up for several New Town and similar developments.10.   The increasing efforts devoted to trying to secure propercollaboration, and the   obstacles to their success, are bothevidence that the administrative structure itself may be inadequate to meet new challenges.    Although it has allowed high standards of service to be achieved and maintained locally, thepresent signs of stress seem likely to grow,11 .   The number of separate authorities in the presentadministrative structure is nearly 700.    They vary-widely in size,resources, opportunity and scope.    Moreover the different types of authority draw on different sources of funds and this delaysand complicates attempts to co-ordinate services.    There are different relationships between the Ministry, on the    one hand,and the local authorities, the Executive Councils and thehospital authorities on the other.    The development of the hospitals as a national service has led to an increasing demand by the hospital authorities themselves for guidancefrom the Department on general principles, but this has oftenproved difficult to formulate in terms of a divided service.Consultation and co-ordination between separate localadministrative bodies, however willing, is bound to be timeconsuming and the effort may be disproportionate to the return,12.   Nor are the respective roles of Regional Hospital boards and Hospital Management Committees sufficiently clear.    Theproblems of staffing a national hospital service with over350 employing authorities are formidable.    Also, the interest which Regional Hospital Boards have increasingly taken in the performance of management functions by Hospital management committees, though not outside their statutory powers, may go9.
mambeyond what was envisaged when the structure was established.Their primary task as originally conceived was planning andco-ordinating development;    their intervention in matters of management has grown out of their responsibility for allocatingfinancial resources;, but is sometimes unwelcome.    Confusedresponsibilities tend to create unsatisfactory relationships.13.   The next two decades will offer great challenges.    Thetask of achieving good standards of service in all areas mustbe pressed forward.    At the same time the patterns of care mustbe continuously adapted to advances in medical, nursing and scientific methods.    The services throughout the country must bealert to create and exploit new opportunities in treatment andprevention.,    The large resources of capital and skilled manpowerinvolved need to be organised and managed with high efficiency atall levels.    The broad national policies and priorities need to cover the whole field of medical and related services;    it wouldwould appear that they could be better drawn and better carriedout if those locally responsible were themselves dealing with a wide range of services and were not confined to planning forone part of the field only.11)..    It is particularly important to employ the men and women in all parts of the service wisely and well, without duplicationof tasks and without confusion of function.    Staff for highly specialised work must not be wastefuily dispersed.15.   All this calls for foresight and planning,  as well as day to day management, of a high order.    It would seem right thatthose making plans for the future and those managing the present arrangements should be more closely linked.   A highly dispersedadministration appears less well fitted to achieve the objectives with the resources available than would be a smaller number of strongly staffed management authorities.    Wide areas and considerable population are desirable as the basis for effective and continuing studies of need and for improving theuse of resources both in the deployment of staffs and the planning of accommodation and facilities.    &quot;Statistical and other sources of information now delineate the community&apos;s need in depth and detail never possible before.    This sharper perceptionof problems of planning and of evaluation of medical careservices demands a higher efficiency than that of which theexisting machinery is capable.&quot; *16.   The present administrative structure is not adapted to meeting these exacting requirements.    It limits the range ofthose responsible for planning future progress to their ownsegment of the service.   Again, some of the hospital regions areperhaps too large;    the Hospital Management Groups, on the otherhand,  are more or less limited to day to day work and theircatchments seldom coincide with the areas of the local health authorities or the Executive Councils.    In evaluating and improving methods of care those professionally responsible mayoften be ready to cross or even to ignore, as far as they can,the existing administrative boundaries.    But this is not enough.The structure ought positively to encourage more integratedservices and patterns of care.    The present structure inhibitsthis and is widely regarded within the service as bothfrustrating and uneconomical.   Resources are not used as effectively as they could be, and this is especially true ofT5S^T**E* ?  Slie J^ Working Party&apos;on the Organisation of -i..ed,.oal ,ork m Hospitals, paragraph 73.

Manpower is more limiting than lackof money, and efficient use of what we have is essential,&apos;m7.   This opinion appears to be widely shared among thoseworking in all quarters of the services.    Many are not happyWith their present &quot;terms of reference&quot; and would welcome the opportunities which a new administrative structure would offer0On the State of the Public Health, p.3.

CONFiPENTlAL                                     ....chapter-rbcr^ 7; *1THE SCOPE OF HEW AUTHORITIES ____v&apos; 1Authority for Medical and. Related Services in each Area&apos;lS.   In the light of what has &quot;been said, it is believed that anew administrative structure is required-    The authorities ofthe future should have wide scope to bring together the related services and plan boldly for new patterns of care,   A further aim should be a drastic reduction in the number of administrative units.The new bodies should bear the direct responsibility for usingresources, including manpower, efficiently and effectively.    Theyshould deal with the needs of fairly large areas and dispose of substantial blocks of resoiirces to meet them.    They should combinethe management and evaluation of today&apos;s work with the planning and preperation of tomorrow&apos;s.io.   The central Government must necessarily have an importantguiding role;    but it should not attempt itself to undertake the tasks of management in the field.    Indeed, the Ministry of Health&apos;srole should be to formulate and state the broad strategy, to define the goals and to see that resources of all kinds are fairly allottedand common policies and priorities pursued in the interest of thewhole community.   Without this framework, local administration wouldlack the necessary direction and purpose.    Tactical execution ofthese strategies would, however, be a local task;    and if it is tobe done well, the responsibility for administering comprehensiveservices in each area should lie squarely upon an area authority.&apos;0.   It is therefore proposed that there should be a single authority ineach area and that these area authorities should replace and undertake^fte functions of the Executive Councils, Regional Hospital Boards,Boards of Governors and Hospital Management Committees, and, asdiscussed below, should be responsible for some important functions nowin the hands of the present local authorities.    This chapter examinesthe possible scope of such an organisation, and it will, of course, be understood from the foreword to this Green Paper that references to establishing new area authorities for the medical and related servicesdp not imply what form the new authorities might take;    for example,whether they would be the reorganised local authorities operatingthrough suitably constituted committees, or Area Boards as described in Chapter 3*- bff-i-hilri. functions of&apos; Area AuthoritiesComprehensive Care21,   The principal object in setting up a new area authority for health services would be to give it comprehensive scope forco-ordinating the policy and operation of a wide range of services;gor planning the efficient use of complementary resources;    andfor striking the right balance beteeen care in the community and hospital care. ....discussed. ggylg-Gg.. at present administered by Executive Councils22.   The advantages that would follow the administration of thesegervices by a new comprehensive authority are outlined inparagraphs 33 to 37.    Uad^aMJLEJ^23. ^ The new area authority might appropriately carry out functionssimilar to those of all the existing hospital authorities, subjectp points discussed later in this Green Paper.   Thus there would bea single tier of administration for all hospitals in the health service, less remote from the individual hospitals than the presentRegional Hospital Boards.   The existing division of administrative. -&apos;sponsibiiity for, on the one hand, day to day control and, on theouner   major planning would come to an end.12.CONFIDENTIAL

The community health services at present provided by the majorlocal authorities need to be considered together with the hospitalar,d general practitioner services.   The next six paragraphs discussarguments in favour of the new area authority undertaking thesecommunity health services.    There are hov/ever also links, and a continuing need for close collaboration, between local health services and other local services in particular those concernedwith public health, environmental services, and social care whichare discussed in later paragraphs.   The arguments in favour of a fully unified administration of the health services must thereforebe looked at alongside the need for co-ordination over a wider field,and in the light of the recommendations of the Seebohm Committee andof the Royal Commission on Local Government in England.    The aim should be to reduce the problem, of co-ordination of different services to the smallest practicable dimensions and to arrange that the geographical areas of administration of the health services?if not the same as, coincide as far as possible with any new localgovernment areas. - -lip.   Taking the main branches of care in turn, firstly, home nursingand health visiting and other health services which the present local health authorities provide for the prevention of illness, care andafter-care require increasingly to be provided alongside and iniclose association with general medical care by the family doctor.These services, together with the establishment of health centres,could appropriately be the responsibility of the new area authority^26.   Secondly,  the pattern of maternity care is changing andthere is an urgent need to organise comprehensive services whichtake into account the high proportion of hospital  confinementswmd. the possibilities of earlier discharge from hospital.     Thellpoimicilary midwifery services, with their close connections bothBdtti the general practitioner and with the hospital maternity and specialist services, would also naturally fall to be administered by the new area authority.ml.   Thirdly, the report of the Sheldon Committee * refers to the^continuing need for a preventive service to safeguard the health ofchildren&quot; and expresses the view that in the long term this &quot;ChildHealth Service&quot; will be part of a family health service provided byfamily doctors working in groups from purpose-built family health centres.    At the same time the Committee has advised that theorganisation of the Child Health Service calls for a highly trainedmedical administrator.    If the present local health authority services for mothers and young children became part of a comprehensiveservice administered by a new area authority, this would provide ajgood framework for implementing the recommendations of the Committee.28o   Fourthly, the organisation and management of the health care ofthe long-term sick, including disabled persons requiring medical and nursing care, and of the elderly and the mentally disorderedip at present the responsibility of general practitioners, hospital authorities and local health authorities.    In total these patients^require the services of a very substantial proportion of the available
staffs, &quot;both in hospitals and. in the community.   The effectivedevelopment of comprehensive services for them requires that all;1 aspects of their health care should he the responsibility of a8 single authority and this would be among the new area authority&apos;s most challenging tasks.29o   Fifthly, programmes of vaccination and immunisation, and therganisation of family planning clinics and of health educationrequire to be closely integrated with the services already mentionedI and developed alongside theme130.   Finally, the chief task of the ambulance service is to carrypatients to and from hospital, mainly for pre-arranged routinejourneys.    To bring this service under an area authority which. would also be responsible for the planning and management of the hospitals, might be expected to result in&quot;a closer operationalrelationship between these services and so secure the most effective use and disposition of ambulances.31.   When these considerations are taken together there is clearly1 a very strong case for the new area authority to take responsibilityI for all the health functions of the present local health i authorities.    This would enable the personal health services now given by general practitioners and by doctors working in publichealth departments to be improved by integration - a processalready started, but requiring to be developed faster.    It wouldpromote the organisation of effective teams, with supporting staff,to provide services based upon group practice and upon health centres.32.   Medical Officers of health would then be able, as officers ofthe area authority, to extend their role as community physicians -specialists in community medicine.   Their duties would include theepidemiological evaluation of the standards of health in each area.The need for this work is becoming more and more obvious, and itmight best be developed and put to its fullest use if care in the community and in hospital were provided by a singleauthority.    The inclusion of responsibilities for the preventionof communicable disease and for environmental hygiene wouldcomplement and strengthen this side of the authority&apos;s v/ork, andis considered later (in paragraphs k3-u8)*General iiedical and Dental Practice and the Ophthalmicand. Pharmaceutical Services; 33.   If new area authorities replaced Executive Councils, theywould be able to enter into contracts with medical and dental practitioners, pharmacists and opticians for the provision ofgeneral medical, general dental, general ophthalmic andpharmaceutical services.   The setting up of new area authoritiesneed not of itself involve changes in the terms of contracts orin the procedure by which they are at present negotiated and determined.   Structural changes of this kind would not have anytearing on the method and level of remuneration, nor would therehe any question of giving the new authorities power which wouldtrench upon the contractors individual clinical independence.3k*      change to a new area authority would not imply a material change as regards professional committees, representing themedical and dental practitioners, opticians and pharmacists,A km
which, reshaped to cover each new area, could be given the samestatutory recognition as now and be formally consulted by thenew area authorities as they are by the present executive councils.   Nor need any change be involved in the role of ServiceCommittees which enquire into questions relating to a contractor&apos;scompliance with his terms of service.35.   A change in local administration need not affect the relevantcentral authorities, such as the National Health Service Tribunal.The Dental Estimates Board could continue to regulate matters relating to the treatment of dental patients and the remuneration[of dentists, and the pricing of prescriptions could continue tobe carried out by a body corresponding to the present JointPricing committee    No change would be implied in the work of theMedical Practices Committee which could continue to receiveinformation periodically from the new area authorities to enable it to judge the adequacy of medical services in practice areas,and to have regard to this in carrying out its functions inrelation to the distribution of doctorsn36. If new comprehensive authorities replaced Executive Councils,:more thought could be given than is at present possible to the orderly development of the general medical services in relationto the other services,-    This would give the family doctor greateriscope to play his part within the health services.    He would be inI contract with the authority responsible for the other communityIcare services and for the hospitals, with both of which he is in1 daily touch;    a formal administrative link would supplement andI improve the existing   operational liaison,,    This would makefit easier to arrange and carry through arrangements for mutual(supporto    For example, the new area authorities would be able to^promote schemes, where these do not yet exist? for the associationof health visitors, home nurses and others with general medical\practices, and would also be responsible for health centres.Tiii3 new-combination of responsibilities should result in a betterIbalanced service, in which community facilities, including theI family doctor service, and the hospitals would be developed with* regard for each other&apos;s needs and capacities and would provide for[continuity of care.    It would be right for the Minister to useIhis general strategic oversight to guide development towardsI securing the best balance between all areas and all activitiesI without impairing local responsibility,,    The new arrangementsIwould also have to ensure that the individual general practitioneriwould have all the support he needed by way of the provision ofjfacilities for his work, without in any way interfering with his[responsibility for his own patients037,   Another valuable feature of the new arrangements would be thatthe new authorities would encourage co-operation between their other services and those provided by dentists, opticians and pharmacists.For example, those aspects of dental work which are of special priority - the treatment of expectant and nursing mothers and ofchildren - would require authorities to co-ordinate the general dental services, the hospital dental services and those dentalservices which are at present provided by local health authoritiesall of which would appropriately become functions of the areaauthorities,15&quot;
7Krnjjilcaj^T ea ch i ng, P o s t gr a dug, t e Medical jSducationSpecialised Services and,,Research38.   No organisation for comprehensive health services would worksatisfactorily unless it were closely integrated with provisionfor clinical teaching, for postgraduate medical education andfor specialised services0   Research too must he carried out intomany aspects of the community, domiciliary and hospital services,&quot;bearing in mind th t basic medical research is primarily theresponsibility of the Universities and the Medical research council and that the role of the Ministry and the National health service is complementary039,   Postgraduate medical education has in recent years beenpromoted by the setting up of a regional organisation to supervise it locally and by the establishment of postgraduateeducation centres for doctors and other professional staff.Future arrangements for their development will require joint action by the Universities,  the professional colleges and theGovernment and the recommendations of the Royal Commission on medical Education are at present being considered.h0*   Clinical teaching and research are carried out both in hospitals at present managed by Hospital Management Committeesunder Regional Hospital Boards, and more particularly in hospitalsdesignated by the Minister as &quot;teaching hospitals&quot; and managed by Boards of Governors responsible directly to him     The teaching hospitals form an essential part of the health service by providing both local district services and some forms of specialised treatment over a wider area;    by conducting research and development;    and by bearing responsibility for training manygrades of staff required throughout the service.    There are thus very strong reasons for including them within the mainpattern of administration, so that their general and specialisedresources can be planned to the best advantage and integrated with the rest of the service.    These hospitals are of greatimportance, both regionally and nationally, and stand in a specialrelation to the Universities.    Provided appropriate arrangements were made in respect of this, they would be suitably placed under the responsibility of the new area authority in whose areathey are located./&quot;A further category of &quot;university hospital&quot; is providedfor in the Health Services and Public Health Bill.716*
.   In accordance with the new authority&apos;s area plans teaching(or university) hospitals would play their part in theprovision of medical and related care in their districts, inclose association with the community services.   At the same timetheir specialised services would he available to meet requirements for a wide area, in some cases stretching far beyond theimmediate area served by the authority(,   Arrangements would haveto be made between authorities and in collaboration withUniversities to co-ordinate the provision of specialisedfacilities required over several areas,, and to provide authorities with advice on clinical research-.,h2.   Arrangements would also be needed for postgraduate medical education.    These might take the form of a postgraduateeducation committee with strong representation from the university and the professional colleges, as well as representation from each of the several area authorities concerned, which wouldhe in a position to guide the development of postgraduate medical education and its integration with the needs of theservice.Public Healthh3.   Close links between the personal health services andcertain aspects of public health work are essential toprevent and control communicable disease.    Responsibilitiesshould be clear so that there is continuous and effectivesurveillance in the community of the incidence of communicabledisease, and of the safety and cleanliness of foools;    and sothat suspicious circumstances are promptly investigated, skilfuland thorough medical assessments made, and firm measures taken to prevent, limit and control the spread of disease.17*
I4J4..   The drawing of the precise dividing line between thepublic health functions of a new area authority and the related functions of local authorities would have to awaitdecisions on the future organisation of local government.Any proposals would then need to be discussed in detailbetween the various authorities, the professional and other bodies, and the Government Departments concernedoI4.5,   If the area authorities were felt to be the appropriate means of deploying in a single organisation all the medical and related skills involved in public health activity, the doctorsconcerned would be well placed to v/ork in close collaboration with general practitioners and hospitals,  and also with thePublic Health Laboratory Service,,    They would require supportingstaff, who might include public health inspectors, and would need to be able to take any necessary notion on behalf of their authority in good time, and have suitable legal powers to do so.,including authority to mobilise assistance In dealing with anyserious outbreaks 0Environmental Servicesk6.     It is also important to have proper links between themedical and the environmental services such as water supply,refuse disposal, sewerage,  clean air, housing and preventionof nuisances.    The appropriate officers of the new area authority might have a specific duty to give advice on themedical aspects to the local authorities and other bodies concerned;    and the local authorities and   other bodies acorresponding duty to seek it, and to provide any   information and assistance required for this purpose.    This would make it unnecessary for the authorities responsible for environmental services to employ their own medical staff,  and would achieveeconomy of medical manpower.    The responsibilities   of the newarea authorities, local authorities and others for the exchangeof information would of course need to be defined.hi.    If the responsibilities of the new area authoritiessuggested in the two preceding paragraphs were coupled with responsibilities for community health functions as described in paras. 25-32,  the present functions and powers of medical officers of Health would be wholly concentrated within the new organisation and they would have the opportunity to develop their important role, and the skills of their staff, in thiswider framework.gorQealth48.    The primary object of a health service at seaports andairports is to prevent the importation of dangerous infectious diseases or unsafe food into the country.    Local responsibilityfor this service could therefore appropriately be placed onthe new area authorities.    Their officers would undertakeinspection of imported food for possible danger to health,  andthey would also carry out the medical examination of immigrants.In London, and elsewhere if the need arose,  a single   porthealth&apos; authority might cover the areas of more than one ofthe new authorities;.1 8.
Other Medic al^andJleJLgted Services (.9,     It would he for consideration whether the new authoritiesshould become responsible locally for any other medical and related services, besides those mentioned,,Voluntary Services50.    The new area authorities, like the local authorities today,vrould make arrangements with voluntary organisations and give them financial and other assistance for the provision andpromotion of services within the general scope of theauthorities&apos; responsibilities.    There would still be ample opportunity for voluntary effort and Leagues of Friends and similar groups could extend their activities to support thefull range of the comprehensive services.Social Care51 -   Wo review of the administrative structure required for medical and related services could be complete which did not take account of the social work services also.    It is truethat different considerations apply to the provision and organisation of the two groups of services, but it is alsotrue that in varying degrees according to the service concernedthey need to be planned and operated in close association with each other.52.     These problems are of crucial importance;    it would,however, be premature to seek to resolve them at the present stage.    The nature of their solution must turn on therecommendations of the Seebohm Committee and of the RoyalCommission on Local Government no less than on theconsideration of the proposals made in this Green Paper.19.
Chapter 3ASPECTS OP ORGANISATIONAREA BOARDSIntroduetipn53.   This chapter describes what the arrangements might he if thenew area authorities were to he specially constituted Area Boards,*responsible directly to the Minister.    It is necessary to describethis possibility in some detail so that it may be examined and discussed.   As stated in the foreword, however,  this does not imply that any conclusion has been reached between this possibility andthe establishment in each area of a suitably constituted committeeof the new type of local authority that may be established when therecommendations of the Royal Commission on Local Government havebeen received and considered.    In the latter case the arrangementsI  would depend, among other things, on the form of local government itself, although many of the principles embodied in the suggested1   detail of Area Boards, aimed at securing the integration of theI   comprehensive services, might still be appropriate - for examplethose mentioned in paragraph 60.    While the general pattern ofI   local authority administration today is well known, there may bechanges after the Royal Commission on Local Government has reported and it would not be appropriate to try to anticipate these in,  detailed discussion in this Green Paper.Number of- Area BoardsI   54o   In discussing the number cf specially constituted Area Boardsthat would be required in England and Wales there are severalfactors to take into account.    Each Board should have full scopeI   for the efficient and imaginative development of comprehensiveservices.   Each must be able to employ the expert skills necessary  for their planning and operation.    Each should be sufficiently1   removed from day to day operations to take a wide view of their   efficiency and requirements,  and to allow the professional staffI   and officers who manage units of the service to get on with theirjobs.   An Area should also group together a number of localitiesI   each of which should be large enough to provide a reasonable,I   natural and coherent working frame for the usual range of community health and general practitioner services, and contain its own focusfj   of hospital services at a district general hospital (or several1  hospitals jointly providing this service for the locality).*  These considerations suggest that each Board should cover quite a1  large area and serve a substantial population,  and that the totalnumber of Boards should not be large - perhaps about forty or fifty,jj  Keeping the number of authorities fairly small would mean fewerjj boundaries between them and thus minimise overlapping of services:it would also assist the flow of information,  ideas and policiesft between authorities,  and between the authorities and the Ministry.j  l^note;;      If these bodies were responsible for health services but noI other service they might appropriately be called Area Health Boards.II In this Green Paper they are simply called &quot;Area Boards&apos;.20.
He    Another important factor affecting both the number of areas,jfnd their shape and size, would be the eventual pattern of areas^for local government.    There would be advantages in having a broadly similar pattern, and in dividing the country between Area Boardsattention would have to be paid not simply to the nature of the health services and the pattern of those services on the ground butblsb to the boundaries of the new local government a.reas unless these were clearly unsuited to the needs of the health services.fl6.   Because of geographical features, population densities andother factors it is likely that the Areas would vary considerably in[flze.   If there were about forty the average population might benear to one million and a quarter though several Areas night haveless than three-quarters of a million and a few as many as 2 or 3gillion.Mj3mber^slii 57.   The members of Area Boards would have the highly responsible-and exacting task of making sound policy decisions to secure the efficient allocation and management of resources, in the light oftheir knowledge of the needs of the service and of local affairs.&quot;Experience of the administration of the existing services has provedline worth of having as members of such authorities persons who aresilling to serve in a voluntary capacity and to make these policy decisions.    If this were the form of administration for Area Boards,it would mean a considerable reduction in the actual number ofllersons required to serve,  since the present Executive Councils,-Hospital Boards, Boards of Governors and Hospital management committees would all be replaced by the smaller number of comprehensive authorities.    This reduction in numbers, however,jrould not imply any criticism of the work of the many present-voluntary members within their current terms of reference.58.   It is suggested that Area Boards should be small, generally ofijhout fifteen or sixteen members, including the Chairman.    Thisllould make for efficient consideration of the important aspects ofpolicy with which members should be concerned.    It should also makefit the easier to establish a clear distinction between the role ofBoard members in directing the service and that of officers Inrunning it.    The advantages of maintaining this distinction havebeen pointed out in the context of local government and are[applicable to the administration of the health services.    the replacement in each area of several Hospital Management Committeesfly the single Area Board should, as regards hospital management,jjnake this distinction easier to draw.ifs.   To allow participation in the administration of locally electedpersons with experience of local affairs,  it would seem important that local authorities should nominate, from among their ownmembership, a proportion of the members of the Area Board. Further,i-n order to bring direct experience of the practical piroblems of theservices and to assist with the task of remodelling patterns of care,&quot;some members with broad professional knowledge of medical and related services would also be needed, though it would not be desirable forthese to be nominated to represent special interests.    With a total membership of sixteen,  a possible arrangement for considerationifngnt be for the Minister to choose and appoint the Chairman and ninemembers, four of whom would be persons qualified in one or other ofIne professions working in those services, and appoint the remainingix on the nomination of the local authorities,   (while in areas21.
containing medical schools he might appoint on the nomination of universities one or two additional members).    On such a basismembers might be appointed to serve for a term of years; thosenominated by a local authority, however, being replaced on ceasingto be a member of that authority.    In general, it might be desirableto provide for flexibility in the size and composition of the membership of Boards, and room should be left for evolution.Internal Organisation60.   The Area Board would require a type of internal organisationappropriate to its comprehensive role.    It would have to be something much more than a roof beneath which separate parts of theservice such as the hospitals on the one hand and community services on the other could lead distinct and largely unco-ordinated lives.It would also need to prevent any tendency for one element in theservice to dominate and distort its policies.    With this in mind,its first main task would be to weld together the services as awhole in both forward planning and day to day operation.    At the outset it would concentrate on securing better co-ordination betweenthe various elements but in time should find that the boundariesbetween them become less distinct and no longer a barrier to the&quot;better use of manpower and other resources.61.   To promote integration there would be a clean break from thepresent divisions: committees would not for instance be set up todeal with particular services in the area such as &apos;hospital services&apos;or &apos;general practitioner services&apos;.    liny standing committeesappointed by the Area Board should cover all parts of the service.They should be few and should be kept small in the interests of efficiency.    A single committee might deal with all the planning and operation of services.    This committee would need widerprofessional participation than would the Board itself.    In orderto draw on further experience and in particular professionalexperience,  it would be desirable to arrange for the co-option tocommittees of people not themselves members of the Board.Committees would also be expected to bring in for consultationother professionally qualified persons as necessary when particularprofessional subjects were to be considered, either by the fullcommittee or by a part of it.22.
Ig^i   The principle of promoting integration should similarly beapplied in the constitution of any advisory body or bodies whichnight be established in each area, so that they would be able tojadvise the Area Board as far as possible on the whole range ofjservices.53.   The organisation of the Area Board&apos;s headquarters should alsome such as would ensure the comprehensive planning and management of services.   The desirable form of organisation seems to be afunctional one.   There might be four or five major departments; -(l) Planning and operation of services;-- maintenance anddevelopment of unified services; planning of new capital projects;  research and statistics; and liaison with theservices of other authoritiess(2) Staffs- personnel and staffing matters; establishments;training; recruitment;  careers; and contracts for service -with special emphasis on securing the optimum use of staffthroughout the service.(3) Logistics;- supply;  construction and maintenance ofbuilding and engineering services and equipment; andtransport.(k) Finances- estimates; accounts; costing and cost/effectiveness analysis.(5) Secretariats- including headquarters and seniorestablishment work; management services; and public relations.    (Possibly in smaller Areas this could be combined with the Staff Department at (2) above.)64.   The role of the headquarters departments is seen as mainly the planning and general direction of services.    Each departmentIwould be staffed by administrative and professional officers, all^responsible to its directing head, who might in some cases be a^professional officer and in some cases an administrative officer.J]\e principal criterion for appointment to directing posts would;be management ability.The Executive and Senior Officers,,&quot;65.   With this form of organisation the senior officers of thelArea Board appointed as &apos; directors&apos; of the four or five functionaldepartments would together make up a small executive.    This$iftecutive would meet frequently and be collectively responsible . toIthe Board for advising it on its objectives and policies, forjjorganising the services of the Area, for executing the Board&apos;sSpolicies and for maintaining the standard of services*166.   The Chief Administrative Officer would have as his principaljtask the co-ordination of the work of the directors and he wouldpreside at the meetings of the Executive *    He would be the Board&apos;principal adviser on all non-professional matters and would also bejdirector of the secretariat department,.    It would be forjjconsideration whether in some areas he should combine this with theVpost of head of the staff department, with suitable administrativeSupport.23.
67,   The Chief Medical Officer, also with access to the Board,would be its principal adviser on all medical professional matters and would he director of the &quot;Planning and operation of services11department.    He would he the professional head of all headquartersmedical staff of the Board in the sense that a doctor in any ofthe Board&apos;s headquarters departments would he entitled to refer tohim any matter of major professional importance.63.   A member of each profession employed in the headquartersdepartments would be designated as chief officer of that profession,whom the other members of the profession employed in the departments could consult on matters of major professional importance, and who could put a professional view to the Executive or, in appropriate cases, to the Board itself.Local Administration69.   No two Area Boards would be likely to be faced with identicalproblems of internal administration.   Within broad guidelines,each would need to develop an organisation suited to itscircumstances, and be prepared to adjust this from time to time andto distribute functions to its officers as changing conditionsrequired.    It would need to lay down clear lines of responsibilityso that, for example, responsible officers at outlying hospitalsor clinics would have the advice and control of superior officerswhenever this was necessary.    Supporting functions such as theprovision of supplies, laundry, the maintenance of buildings andequipment, transport, the payment and recruitment of staff andfinancial procedures would be carried out in the most efficient way,on an area, district or unit basis.70.   The staff locally in charge should be given as much personal responsibility as practicable.    In particular, officers responsiblefor hospital services at the level of the major Individual hospitals and groups of hospitals providing district general services would continue to carry substantial responsibilities.71.. The new comprehensive Boards would be required to developarrangements for securing integration of the separate services which each of the several operational districts which each area would contain.   The services In each district incorporating health centres and all other facilities as well as a hospital, or severalhospitals, providing district general services, would be the basicbricks in each Board&apos;s administrative arrangements.   Day to dayco-ordination of these services would fall upon the senior staffworking within them: for example, the Chairman of the hospital medical advisory committee or its equivalent, the hospitaladministrator, the community physician and - though not themselves&apos;staff - the general practitioners.   To assist them thereoould be assigned to districts officers with a general responsibility for helping to co-ordinate services and for keeping &apos;the headquarters in touch with local developments.Flexibility72. The main framework of the ^^i^JJnrl^SS sTfar^embodied in legislation but it would be very des 1 jna       alldas possible within this framework there should ^^^^^^f/theroom for new approaches.   This opportunity ha   teen lacnngpattern of administration under the existing law.   The legisStatutory Framework for Area Boards2U.
which would he required to set up specially constituted area boards might, subject to the decisions of Parliament, have the^following aims.(a) The Minister would have a general s tatutory duty to promote the development of comprehensive health services for the people of England and Wales andfor that purpose to provide or to secure theI provision of services.I(b) The Minister would have a specific statutory duty to provide throughout England and Wales, to such extent as he considers necessary and reasonable,accommodation and services, including hospital and specialist services and community health services.    In addition to this requirement toprovide services, the Minister would be required toarrange the provision of certain other community services, including general medical, dental,ophthalmic and pharmaceutical services.(c) For these purposes the Minister would be requiredto set up Area Boards, to exercise on his behalffunctions with respect of the administration,management and control of the services in accordancewith regulations and with such directions as mightbe given by him.    It would be a specific statutoryduty of the Boards, in accordance with regulations,to make arrangements with medical and dental practitioners, opticians and pharmacists, for theprovision of general medical, dental, optical andpharmaceutical services.   The responsibilities and powers of Boards and their officers In relationto public health, food hygiene and safety, and environmental hygiene would be provided for.- Pole of the Minister in relation to Area Boards73&apos;   The Minister should not intervene In the detailed management of the services by the Area Boards (although he would have powersto do so as a last resort) since this would detract from the Boardssense of responsibility and would also leave him less free to concentrate on his own central directing tasks.   While the minister would have a general power to give directions on any aspect of theservice, it is suggested that as far as possible he should use these powers, not to settle particular matters, but to lay downgeneral principles.   Thus he might define from time to time thematters in which Boards would be required to follow standards ofgood practice formulated centrally, and perhaps specify certainspecialised services the development of which would require hisspecific approval.Ik-   Securing the co-ordination of services administered by the separate Area Boards would be a part of the Minister&apos;responsibility and he could when appropriate use his powers totake specific action or enstire that it was taken by the Boards.For example, it would be necessary for groups comprising twoor three Boards to make joint arrangements for the dischargeof certain of their functions and if need bo the Minister would&apos; 25.4&apos; 4
; use his powers to bring this about.   The Minister would alsotie able to provide services direct, where these were more appropriately provided on a national basis.75.   The Minister would on many matters probably prefer toproceed by issuing guidance, e.g. on standards, and it would always be open to Boards to seek it.    For this relationship to work well there would need to be a full and steady flow of information and ideas between the Boards and the Ministry,covering all aspects of the service, and there should beopportunities for the exchange of professional and other staff.76.   An important example of existing- services which would need to be further developed, partly by joint arrangement of severalArea Boards and partly by the Minister direct, would beoperational research, and such statistical and related information services as were essential for efficient management by the newBoards and for a proper understanding of their activities.77.   If it were decided to set up Area Boards the appropriateadministrative arrangements for the Special Hospitals atBroadraoor, Rampton and Moss Side, which are at present administereddirectly by the Minister, could be reconsidered.Dealing with Complaints78.   If Area Boards were set up they would be expected, as the responsible local managers of the services, to deal promptly withcomplaints from members of the public about the services provided forBnem or their relatives.   When appropriate, as it might well be in serious cases, they would be able to investigate the complaintformally, as the present hospital authorities do, if necessarysetting up an independent enquiry for the purpose.75&apos;   There might nevertheless be cases where the member of the publicwho made a complaint to an Area Board was dissatisfied with theirjeply or the action taken, and wished to seek an independent view.Alternative ways of approaching this problem could be considered.Epr instance, if it had been decided to set up Area Boards withcomprehensive responsibilities covering the full range of health services to the patient, consideration might be given to bringing the relevant activities of the Boards within the ambit of theparliamentary Commissioner for Administration in order that he could&apos; enquire into matters referred by Members of Parliament within hisawn terms of reference.HO.   An alternative possibility for consideration is that thereshould be available a person, not appointed by either the Area[Board or the Minister, but perhaps by the Privy Council, who couldtie asked directly by the complainant to look into the matter locally,*and who after due enquiry would report to the Board on v/hether therewas any further action which, in his view, the Board should take.Such an independent person might perhaps on the analogy of theparliamentary Commissioner for Administration be called a 1 HealthCommissioner&apos;.   Normally the Board would be expected to acceptIInd- imPlement the. Health Commissioners recommendation, but in theevent of this not being done the matter might be reported to theMinister who would then have the responsibility for deciding,after considering the Commissioners report, what action should betaken.   The Minister himself v/ould be answerable to Parliament and26.
rrangements would &quot;be needed so that the Commissioner could makeknown to the public and Parliament cases where his recommendations were not accepted.81.   So that each part of the country was covered by a HealthCommissioner familiar with the local circumstances there might need to be more than one.    It might be desirable for a nationalCommissioner to exercise a general oversight of the working of thearrangements and thus to ensure a common standard of practice inthe investigation of complaints throughout the country.82.   Many types of personal and individual complaints would beopen to investigation by the Health Commissioners.   The boundaries of their jurisdiction would however need careful definition.   Porexample they would not intervene In an issue such as an allegationof negligence which could more properly be pursued in the courts,or take up matters between the Board and its employees.   The HealthCommissioners would not be concerned with clinical matters to agreater degree than an ad hoc board of enquiry set up under existing arrangements by a hospital authoritjr or by the Minister; or than theService Committees which deal with allegations that a general medicalor dental practitioner, optician or pharmacist has failed to complywith his terms of service.   The Health Commissioner^, relationship,if any, with Service Committees would also need to be considered.Staff and Training83.   Area Boards would be the employing authorities for all their staff.    The importance of staffing and personnel matters would berecognised if, as has been suggested above, a &quot;Staff Department&quot;were to be one of the main functional divisions within theorganisation of each Board,27.
8I+.   Rates of pay and conditions of service would continue to besettled through national machinery.    Certain aspects of manpowerwould also have to he centrally supervised.    This is hecau.se it isessential to secure on the one hand a balanced development of services over the country as a whole and on the other a satisfactory-career structures these must he among the most important of allobjectives in the successful management of a national service.In recent years, for example,  the balanced development and careerstructure of specialist medical staffing in hospitals have been dealt with under special arrangements,  and this must continue to beso.   Arrangements for postgraduate education have been mentioned inparagraph U2.1-&quot;4lilt?.   At national level it is also suggested that it might bedesirable for a body to be created to carry out for as wide a rangef^pf staff as possible functions similar to those now undertaken bythe National Staff Committee for administrative and clerical staffsin the hospital service,  and by the National Nursing Staff Committee.Its functions would be to improve methods of planning careers,  toassist in organising non-professional training, and to developselection and appointments procedures,-86.    In general,  the devising and supervision of training programmes;-.wpuld need to be handled on a wider geographical basis than a singlearea.Hi 87.   Steps would also have to be taken well in advance of milking any final change to a new administrative structure to prepare staff forEgtheir prospective roles.    In particular training for management in aBgliified service should be an early priority,h8/5.   Before any changes in the administrative structure wereImplemented,  there would be full consultation with all staff :    :,:;or&quot;3concerned,  on their effects on the staff themselves,  for example onany superannuation questions which might arise.    The GovernmentKpuld also consult with the appropriate bodies regarding any consequential changes in the administration of the training of professional staff.Fijianc i al^^sp ec t sm89.   The services administered by the existing hospital authoritiesSid Executive Councils are financed by the central government andif these were transferred to specially constituted Area Boardsresponsible to the Minister,  this basis of finance would be continued.This would be a straightforward change so far as cenxral government finance is concerned but it would be necessary to considerarrangements for the distribution and management of the HospitalEndowment Fund and Trust Funds held by hospital authorities.90.    If Area Boards were set up,  It is assumed that the central;Ppvernment would take responsibility for any services transferred tothem from the local authorities and that the assets and liabilities of authorities in respect of services transferred would betransferred to the Minister,    There would be important financialissues to be considered in such a transfer.    Current expenditure on local authority health services is approximately  11+0 million a year-and is increasing,    At present it forms part of the relevant expenditure of local authorities taken into account in determiningHpG level of the Rate Support Grant.    If the central government were^0 assume direct financial responsibility for some or all thesemm11 280
CO NFS DENTS ALservices it would &quot;be necessary to take the changed circumstancesfully into account in the financial transactions between central and local government.91,   Part of the present revenue expenditure on the local health services is the servicing of loans raised by local authorities toi finance capital works,    ho compensation would be payable for assetsi transferred but the central government would assume responsibilityfor outstanding loans and would provide direct finance for further capital development.II92.   At present total expenditure on the health services in Englandand Wales amounts to approximately  1,4.00 million a year.    It is to/be expected that if Area Boards were set up the Government wouldmake financial resources available to them in accordance with theirrange of functions and requirements and in the light of competing claims, as they do at present in the case of the centrally financedBhealth services.    The sums required would be the subject of Estimatespresented to Parliament and the Votes would be accounted for in thei usual way; the Minister would be answerable to Parliament as he isfat present in respect of the centrally financed health services.The accounts of Boards would be audited by auditors appointed by theMinister,  and the Comptroller and Auditor General would have access to them and report upon them.    Since the Area Boards would beadministering services on behalf of the Minister, using central; funds, the financial transactions of the Boards would be subject toI ^Regulations made by the Minister (for example, as to general financial control and the setting up by Boards of Finance Committeesand the responsibilities of these Committees and of Chief FinancialOff ic era).&apos;93.   A transfer to Area Boards of responsibility for administeringi the various services should not of itself have any very appreciableHeffect on the level of expenditure on health and welfare services[ &quot;taken as a whole,    (A temporary increase in central government; expenditure would, however, be expected from the change in themethod of financing capital works mentioned in paragraph 91).9U.   Integration of the services and more efficient use of resources,including staff, should, once the new arrangements had become^established, ensure a substantial Improvement in the effectivenesswith which the finance made available for the services was used.The Minister would have in mind the need to develop services as a balanced and coherent programme, with the community services being given proper scope.     Within the limits set by the Minister in suchnational policies, it would be within the discretion of Area Boardsto   :e the funds allocated to them in accordance with theirassessment of local requirements,195.    &quot;Logistics&quot; is a term used to indicate a number of the veryfimportant activities which would be required to support Area Boards&apos;I comprehensive health services.    Chief among them would be theprovision of buildings,  in accordance with the Area&apos;s developmentiPians, the supply of equipment and stores, transport and maintenancefscrvices.    The detailed arrangements for these supporting functionsIwould require careful consideration.    As regards the proposals tobet up Area Boards the following points should be kept in mind.I 29o
96.   To provide and equip new premises for the services administeredfly the Area Boards and to improve and maintain existing buildings,plant and equipment, three main activities would be required:(a) to draw up the capital programmes,(b) to plan, design construct and commission the new buildings,(c) to maintain what is already in use.lapital Programming97,   The starting point for the Board&apos;s comprehensive capital programme would be the hospital building programme establisheditnder the present arrangementsy and the long-term plans of localauthorities for the development of health centres and other services.Steps for implementing these programmes would already have been planned for several years ahead - e.g. up to ten years in the case&apos;pf hospital programmes.     Within a nationally determined and&quot;carefully balanced overall plan, these programmes would beperiodically reviewed and rolled forward by the Area Boards, whowould decide on the steps for implementing them, in accordance withthe resources made available to them for this purpose.     In the caseof the largest hospital projects, however, where the sums involved-were very substantial in relation to a single Board&apos;s resources,decisions on priorities would have to be made centrally,  since thiswould involve choosing between very large schemes in different areas,-and affect the balance of the programmes as a whole.Design, Construction and Maintenance98,   Area Boards would be building authorities and would themselvesplan, contract for and supervise both the maintenance of existingpremises and services and the provision of new buildings,  subjectfto any necessary approval by the Ministry and guidance on standards.For some of this work they would probably commission outside firmsof consultants.     Boards would be as self-sufficient as possible,hut in the case of some large projects the capacity of a single4oard&apos;s office might be too small to provide suitably skilled[project teams.     The grouping of Boards for building pxxrposes inconsortia employing the architectural, engineering and otherprofessional staff concerned, might well therefore be desirable.;Bu pllesi9.   The existing arrangements for the provision of hospital suppliesjare in the process of being strengthened by extending the supplyfunctions of Regional Hospital Boards and establishing a newcentral organisation at the Ministry.     The establishment of area boards would require adjustments of this machinery and a definitionjpf the respective roles of the Area Board&apos;s supply team and the^entral organisation,  so as to secure the most efficient supply^arrangements not only for hospitals, but for all the appropriateparts of the service.     Collaboration between a number of Areas forcertain supply purposes would probably be necessary.B-00, Consideration would be given to placing on Area Boards somepf the functions of the Ministry in relation to the provision of artificial limbs and appliances.30.
^Ambulances ano^^i2aiisj)ort21101. The Area Boards would operate ambulance and other transportIrequired in connection with their services.      There would bearrangements on a wider basis for the training of staff and perhapsIf or major vehicle repairs.ILand1102. To the extent that it was decided that services at present^provided by local authorities should be administered by Area Boards,fit would be necessary for the Boards to take into their use the:properties concerned.      In respect of this and other property theyIwould exercise all necessary powers on behalf of the Minister,  inIwhom the property would formally vest and who would have any necessary-powers of compulsory purchase, as is the case at present with^property for the hospital service.Arrangements in London103. Special consideration v/ould have to be given to the applicationof the principles of this Green Paper to the London Area where thejservices are unique in size and complexity and where the local[government pattern is set for the foreseeable future     Care must betaken to provide a structure that will assist the integration ofjail parts of the service,  continue the development of a rational^deployment of hospital services (including provision for clinical-teaching and research) and allow the smooth progress of the communityjservices for which the London Boroughs are now responsible.      On thejhasis, discussed in paragraphs 21 to 32,  that area authoritiesIshould have responsibility for comprehensive health services both in&apos;hospitals and the community,, and if these v/ere to be Area Boards,,there would appear to be at least two broad alternatives that meritI consideration:-(a) To establish five Boards to cover the whole of greater london, each Board including the area of two or more inner london Boroughs and of several outer London BoroughsBPopulations would be about 1^-lf million.      This kind ofarrangement v/ould accord generally with the recommendations &apos;of the Royal Commission on Medical Education.(b) To establish two Area Boards for the Inner London Boroughs,and four Area Boards for the rest.     Populations would beI about 1-1-ir mill ion.IlOh, On any arrangements, provision v/ould need to be made for closeI collaboration between Boards within the Metropolitan area, and also  with Boards in the adjacent home counties e.g. for ambulanceIservicesc31.5 0
