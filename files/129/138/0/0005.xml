The conclusions of the Electoral Advisory Conference are set out in the Appendix.     The White Paper covers parliamentary elections only,2.       I should draw particular attention to two points:(a) Party Labels on Nomination and Ballot PapersThe Ministerial Subcommittee on Electoral Reform are considering what system of registration of Party labels would be needed to ensure that only accredited candidates could use the title of their Party, and that independent candidates could not use labelsso closely resembling those of accredited candidates as to misleadthe voters.(b) Candidates&apos; DepositsThe Cabinet approved the proposal to raise the deposit from 150 to  250, but I would ask my colleagues to reconsider this proposal.Since the increase is not high enough to deter frivolous candidates, it may cause controversy without bringing any significant advantage.    I, therefore,invite my colleagues to agree to leave the figure at  150.3, I seek the agreement of my colleagues to publish the White Paper(amended as to paragraph 2(b) above) at the end of July, with a view to aclebate on the reform of Parliamentary election law in October.L, J.

DRAFT WHITE.PAPER ONREVIEW OF ELECTORAL LAWTn May 19^.5 Mr- Speaker announced his agreement to preside over a Conference on Electoral Law.     He also announced that theume secretary, in agreement with the Secretary of State forScotland, would he convening his Electoral Advisory   Conference,body consisting of representatives of Government Departments,electoral registration officers and acting returning officersand of the principal political parties.     As part of the reviewof electoral law, the Electoral Advisory Conference has considered a numLer of detailed questions relating to parliamentary electionprocedure.     Its meetings were attended by   a representativereturning officer   and representative sheriff clerks and electoral registration officers from Scotland.Both Conferences have now completed their work.     Therecommendations of the Speaker&apos;s Conference are consolidated intheir final report published in February 1968 as Cmnd. 3550*Annex A of the final report summarises the Conference&apos;srecommendations for changes in the law;    and Annex B sets outmatters on which they decided not to recommend any change in thelaw.     Specific recommendations mentioned below are identified byreferences to t -..o Annex in which they appear and their numberwithin that Annex.The Government have considered, the recommendations of bothConferences.     In view of the number and variety of therecommendations, the Government think it would be helpful if theywere to indicate their own provisional conclusions on the major issues raised by the recommendations of the Speaker1 s Conferenceand the extent to which they do not agree with the recommendationsboth of the Speaker&apos;s Conference and of the Electoral AdvisoryConference,i^u^MMOSLi^suT^sFRANCHISE AID REGISTRATIONMinimum age for voting (Recommendation A.1)After giving full weight to the recommendation of the speaker&apos;s Conference that the minimum age for voting should betwenty years, the Government havedecided,      having regard to their acceptance of the recommendationof the Latey Committee as to the age of majority, to recommend that theminimum age for voting should be reduced to eighteen years.The Government accept that a person should be entitled to vote at an election held on or after the day on which he reachesvoting age.   fluency, of publication of the electoral register(Hecommenda t ion^.h )The Government accept, primarily on economy grounds, themajority recommendation of the Speaker&apos;s Conference that thereshould continue to be one annual register, as at present.1.
CONDUCT OP ELECTIONSPublic -npijilgn -polls and, betting odds (Recommendation A.31 )The Government are not convinced that the publication ofopinion polls and betting odds within 72 hours of the poll undulyinfluences electors.    It would be hard to suppress evasions of a prohibition on their publication, and the Government do not thinktherefore that the majority recommendation of the Speaker&apos;conference should be accepted.phi 1 ins: hours (Re commeridatlon B. 18)In the interests of electors, the hours of polling at parliamentary elections, on which the Speaker&apos;s Conference had recommended no change, and which now end at 9 p.m., should beextended to 10 p.m.gartyjlabe. s on ballot papers (Recommendation Bc25)The Government thirk there is a strong case in principle -provided any necessary administrative machinery can be worked out -for party labels to be shown on nomination and ballot papers.Accordingly, they do not accept the recommendation of the speaker&apos;s Conference that reference to a candidate&apos;s party onnomination papers and consequently on ballot papers should continueto be prohibited.Exemptions from provIsions relating toelection expenses(Recommendation A,3oH --- &apos;The Government accept the recommendation of the Speaker&apos;conference that broadcasting should be exempted from the provisions relating to election expenses in section 63 of the representation on the People Act 1949.    They think, however, that a broadcastrelating to a particular constituency should be exempt if allcandidates agree to the broadcast,  even though some of them do not wish to take part themselves, rather than, as recommended by the speaker&apos;s Conference,  only if all candidates agree to take part.II, JjTKER RECOjJMENpATIONS^On all other points save the following the Government accept in principle the recommendations of the Speaker&apos;s Conference.PRANCEISE ATOJREGISTRAT;ION uglifying date for,J^jn-j^sra^ )The Government find that there are strong practicalobjections to adopting, as suggested by the Speaker&apos;s Conference,a qualifying date of 1st November, and would propose to maintainthe existing qualifying date of 10th October.Registration of wives of servicemen (Recommendation A.1U.)The Government consider that no obligation should rest on theService authorities to obtain information for the purpose of registration in respect of the wives of servicemen residing inoeryice quarters in&quot;the United Kingdom.    This is essentially a civilian matter.2.
CONDUCT OE ELECTIONSIf a postal voter does not receive Ms postal ballot paper,there will hardly he time for him to apply for a tendered ballot paper.   Moreover, a tendered ballot paper would not be countedunless a court so directed on a scrutiny of the votes inconnection with legal proceedings in respect of an election.Witness ^ad^rg^^^^e^^ of jdentityThe Government think it preferable,  in the interestsespecially of the elderly and infirm, that the postal votingprocedure should be kept as simple as possible.   additional requirements such as this would increase the grounds on whichvotes could be disallowed.No special publication of number of spoilt ballot papersThere are already means of obtaining this information, butthe Government see no reason why it should not be specificallygiven when the result of an election is declared, and thus be readily available to the publicoPublic notice to be given by the returning officer of the legalmaximum of candidates&apos; election expenses (Recommendation A.33)Apart from the practical difficulties involved, theGovernment think it would be unsatisfactory for the law to require an official to determine and publish the permitted maximum amount of candidates&apos; election expenses and that it is not unreasonable to continue to look to the election agent to determine the amount for his own and his candidates&apos; purposes.Free install at ion ^of, telejohones (Recommendation Aa3h)The law already enables candidates at parliamentary elections to send one election communication post free to eachelector.     At a general election the cost to public funds -cn present figures - is estimated at about  850,000.     TheGovernment do not agree that further public funds should bemade available to candidates.ELECTION EXPENSES3*
Ncchange ^n oaiKiiAate&apos;&apos;-:s deposit (Recommendation B.31)The present figure of  150 has &quot;been unchanged since 1918,In the Government&apos;s view this is not now a sufficient deterrentfrivolous candidatures, and the amount should be increased to 250.ELECTORAL   ADVISORY   conference the conclusions of the Electoral Advisory Conference onthe matters specifically referred to them, and on other matterson which they recommended that action should be taken, are set out in. the Appendix; to this White Paper.     The Governmentwould propose to accept all the conclusions except thosenumbered 2, 8 and 15(b) in Part A.     They consider that the merits of a draft register (on which they have not yet reached a conclusion) can be weighed up without a specialexperiment (Recommendation 2),     They believe that it wouldbe unwise to pick out the case of premises that have been demolished from the range of possible reasons for a changeof address, for the special exercise of discretion in::;;:;addressing poll cards (Recommendation 8).     Since improperdisclosure would not only be an offence under the Representationof the People Act, but also inconsistent with a police officer&apos;sduty, the Government see no reason for time to be devoted&quot;by police officers to&apos; making a declaration of secrecy(Recommendation 15(b)) 0COINIFf BEWTiAL
