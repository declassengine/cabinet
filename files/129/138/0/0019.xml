I attach as an Annex an account of the course ofthe negotiations up to the final breakdown on 26th July and information about the costs of the claim and the final offer.5X  t^.jj  :i-L^6^ Jul^2.     The Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes reviewed thesituation at its meeting on 30th July and decided that the Governmentshould not at that time intervene in the dispute.3.     At a meeting on 30th August, 1968 the National Committee of theAmalgamated Engineering and Foundry Workers&apos; Union (AEF) decided by a vote of 31 to 30 to call a strike in support of the claim from the23rd September.     This decision was critically received by some of theother unions in the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions(CSEU).    Informal conversations I had in Blackpool at the Trades UnionCongress showed that even within the AEF moderates like Mr. Boyd andMr. Simpson would be ready to settle for a good deal less thanMr, Scanlon is insisting on.    This is true also of moderate leaders ofother Union? like Mr. Cannon.    However at a meeting on 9th Septemberleaders of the 30 unions in the CSEU passed a resolution in favour of strike action but they postponed the date till 21st October.    Some unions^including probably the Electrical Trades Union (etu), the General and municipal Workers1 Union (GMV/U) and the Boilermakers1 Union, as wellas some of the smaller unions are balloting their members on the strikeissue.    At a meeting in York on 12th September the Executive Councilof the CSEU endorsed the strike decision.Tactics and Timing4.     The immediate question for consideration is whether theGovernment should intervene and if so, when.    Neither side has requestedintervention but it is evident that with such long notice of the intention to strike there will be pressure for the Government to seek a means of avoiding the strike.-1-
5.      Private soundings of the Engineering Employers1 Federation (EEF)indicate that their present attitude is to stand firm, to make no approach to the unions with a prospect of an increased offer and to hope that theGovernment will not intervene.    The EEF feel that at present an initiative on their part or Government intervention would only strengthen the hands of the militants and dishearten those union leaders who would wish to avoid a strike and reach a settlement on moderate terms.6.     Union opinion appears to be against any further approach to theEEF but is divided on the question of Government intervention.George Barratt, General Secretary of the CSEU, had indicated privatelyand off-the-re cord a strong wish for intervention! but that is a personal view.    Mr. Cannon by contrast has made it clear to me privately thathe is strongly opposed to intervention in advance of the ballots which hisand   other moderately minded unions are arranging, on the ground that intervention would play into the h&amp;a&amp;R of the militants and could even hysuggesting weakness, produce a hostile result in the ballots.    Mr. Scanlon1views are not known, but in view of the division in the union ranks he mightfavour intervention if (as Mr. Cannon thinks) it would help to produce aresult favourable to his cause.7.      The Government will increasingly find it difficult to appear to bestanding by inactively as the threat of a major strike approaches.    At thesame time premature action likely to weaken the employers and to favour the militants and undermine the efforts of the moderates among the unionsmust be avoided.    Negotiating attitudes could be more realistic under the pressure of a more imminent threat of disruption.    We cannot be certainhow the ballots will go and how this might affect the situation.    They mightshow results for or against the strike or come up with conflicting answers.The voting might be light.     The results themselves will not be availablefor some time.    The etu result is expected in the first week of October.8.      The time for Government intervention must be when tacticallythere seems the best hope of achieving a successful result withoutundermining the incomes policy.    I do not think this is the right time.It is clear from the figures in the Annex that the employers1 offer isalready approaching the limits admissible under the White Paper.    I am,however, considering and having costed possible alternative bases for settlement which might be put forward when the time is right.    these include both adjustments of the current offer and the possibility of a new approach, such as a shorter term agreement if that would offer moreopportunity for accommodation and manoeuvre.    I shall keep in close touch with the situation and consider in the light of developments when theGovernment might best be expected to produce useful results.9.     I invite the comments of my colleagues on this appraieal of thesituation and on my recommendation that for the moment there shouldbe no Government intervention but that I should prepare an assessment of possible alternative bases for settlement.B.

ANNEXEngineering;   Manual Workers1.     The last package agreement between the Engineering Employers Federation(E.E.F.). and the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Union (C.S.E.U.)came to an end, with consolidation, on 1st January 1968.   It established the following minimum time rates with minimum piece-work standards15$ higher:Skilled Fitters 257s. 8d.Labourers 217s. 4d.Adult Women        198s. 6d.2.     On 31st March 1967 the C.S.E0Uo formally presented a claim for anew long term agreement to include a general pay increase, a substantial increase in basic     OSS 5 cl reduction in normal hours, increased overtimepay, longer holidays, non-contributory sick pay and pensions scheme,improved shift premiums, equal rates for men and women and improvements in the guaranteed week agreement.   The C.S.E.U. was led by Mr. John Boyd.In making the submission shorter hours and provision for sick pay and pensions were not pressed.3.     Following a reference to the National Board for Prices and Income s(N.B.BI.)for examination of the 1964 Long Term Agreement and a separate reference of staff workers pay and conditions, the N0B.P.I. issued a first reportin December 1967 (Command&quot;3495).   The Board commented on the problems which arose from anomalous pay structures and fragmented bargaining inthe industry and recommended, in respect of manual workers, that thereshould be no general increases (since it would reduce the provision for improving the position of the lower paid and dealing with anomalies) butthat, nationally, there should be a one year agreement raising the basic rates by means of minimum earnings levels (M.E.L.s) by 36/- (skilled men) te30/- (labourers and women).   The cost was estimated at 2% of the wage bill.Domestic increases were to be determined against criteria based on theguidelines for productivity agreements, and firms should be allowed to useup to a further 2% of their wage bills to rationalise wage structures andbegin an attack on wage drift.   These recommendations were denounced by thetrade unions as going beyond the N.B.P.I.&apos;s terms of reference,4.     The E.E.F. consulted its constituent members and met the C.S.E.U. on27th March 1968 to reply to the claim.   Mr. Scanlon had now replacedMr. Boyd in leading the C.S.E.U.   The E.E.F. offered to negotiate on thebasis of measures to increase productivity and efficiency coupled withincreases in minimum earnings levels and discussions on the guaranteed weekagreement.   Negotiations nearly broke down at that point.
5. At subsequent meetings on 10th and 18th April the E.E.F. put forward a further offer of a three-year agreement giving a series of increasesat any ageThe duration of the agreement and the bargaining rights duringits currency would also be specified.   Piece work basic rates and theminimum piece work standards would be left for further discussion.6.     The offer was rejected by the C.S.E.U. which put forward a counterclaim for(a) A substantial general increase(b) A minimum basic rate of  20 for skilled men after three years(c) Additional holidays(d) Progress towards equal pay for women7.     The executives of the C.S.E.U,&quot; constituent unions considered theposition at a meeting on 1st May 1968 and recommended a one day strikewith the possibility of further action.   At the A.E.F. national committee meeting, which the First Secretary addressed, Mr. Scanlon had pressed for a mandate for more widespread industrial action but theConference voted only for a one-day token strike and most of the other unions also resisted further action.   The strike took place on15th May 1968, and was well supported.    In notifying the E.E.F.  of the recommended strike action the C.S.E.U. kept open the possibility offurther meetings, at any time and in replying the E.E.F. expressedwillingness to continue negotiations in an atmosphere free from duress.Meanwhile, in separate negotiations the Shipbuilding Employers had offered two general increases each of 6/- (skilled), increases in M.E.L.Sand two days additional holiday in return for productivity concessions.8.     The C.S.E.U. took no decision on the question of further industrial action and the E.E.F.  entered into informal soundings to test union reaction to the kind of deal they had proposed and try and ascertain their minimumdemands.   These soundings led to agreement on a basis for resuming informalnegotiations which would include discussion of a general increase, an offer on holidays, further negotiations on the increase in minimum basic rates andan examination of equal pay.(a) Agreement in principle on the most effective use of resources(b) Domestic bargaining to be based on agreed criteria and practical cost considerations(c) The acceptance of the principle that training could take placem
9.     Following a policy decision the E0E0F0 met C.S.E0U0 representatives in an informal meeting, at Weymouth, on 24th June 1968 and offered a threeyear agreement giving, eventually, time rates of  17 (skilled) 13 (labourer) and  12 (adult women) with two stage general increases(12/- in total, for skilled men and pro rata for other grades) and three days of additional holiday by 1971-   The offer Was badly received by theunions but a further informal meeting was arranged for 18th July.10.   At this meeting the E0E0F, negotiators had authority to improve their offer up to a skilled rate of  18 and general increases of 15/- if therewas an indirection of willingless to compromise by the other side.   Therewas no sign of this although the EoEoF, slightly improved the offer on theminimum rates (see para. 13) and the discussion ended, without agreement,on a decision to call a formal meeting of che full negotiating committeeon 26th July 1968.    On 18th July the E0EoFo learned, for the first time,that the unions thought the general increase should be 30/-.11,   No progress was made at the formal meeting on 26th July which ended in failure to agree.12.   At the negotiating meeting on 26th July the E.E.F. formally, setout their last offer as:(a) three additional days of holiday, one in 1969, one in 1970 andone in 1971 (l.25$)(b) general pay increases in two stages in 1969 and 1970:12s. Od. (total) for skilled men and pro rata for other grades(3.4/o)(c) progressive increases in M.E.Ls, leading, together with thegeneral increases, to the following minimum basic rates after three years -Skilled Fitter  17 10s. Od.    Labourer  13 7s. 6d.   Adult Women  12 6s.(0.73/o for the M.E.Ls, 3.6% on consolidation into basic rates)The above calculations of the percentage cost are those made by theE.E0F0 (and not disclosed to the unions) and total 3% over three years ofthe proposed agreement (3.0fo per annum) or, assuming implementation from september, over three years and nine months (2.4% per annum) since the endof the last agreement.13.   The EoEcFo also quantified their understanding of the CoS0E0Uo claimas:/(a)
(a) A general increase of 30s. for skilled men and pro rata forother grades(b) Three days of additional holiday (l-g-/o).(c) A minimum rate for skilled men of  20 after three years withthe labourers rate not less than Q0% of this and parity with thelabourer for the women&apos;s rate (9i$).The total of AS^o over three years was put at an additional cost to the wage bill of  275 million per annum.14.   The percentage calculations relate only to the bare minimum cost of applying the minimum provisions of the E0E0Fo offer or the CoS0EoUo claim(e.g. raising only those on lower earnings to the M0E0Ls).    There will,however, be consequential changes as a result of the effect of the M.E.Lson piece-work schemes and the differentials in immediate work groupings.There are also likely to be some further repercussions.    It is notpossible to make close estimates of these additional costs.15.   The attitude of the EoE0Fo to further concessions on the question of basic rates is conditioned by the practical effect on the cost to thoseof their members who employ large numbers of women especially in thelight electrical industry.    The minimum earnings provisions would have thegreatest effect on women&apos;s earnings, would have some effect on the earnings of unskilled men, but would affect semi-skilled and skilled men to a lesser degree.   On the present minimum basic rates the labourers&apos; rate is Qlffiof that of the fitter and the women&apos;s rate is 3\% of the labourers&apos; rate.The general unions and especially the T0 &amp; &amp;.&apos;W.y. have said that they arenot prepared to see any worsening of the women&apos;s proportion or thelabourers&apos; rate reduced below 80^o   of the skilled rate.   An improved offer on the skilled rate v/ould therefore mean comparable changes for other gradesand increase the cost of an agreement since the effect of the Mf.E0Ls on costs rises disproportionately as they are increased.   Any further improvement in the iv!0E0Ls v/ould virtually be a general increase for women in the light electrical section of the industry.   Raising the offer to a 20 skilled rate (and maintaining these differentials) would mean another 2 on the women&apos;s rate.   &amp;0EoCo have estimated that the last E.Ec.Po offer would add 20^ to their wage bill./16.
16.      An agreement between the E.E.F. and the C.S.E.U, would have repercussions on many new federated engineering firms and in otherindustries.   The Shipbuilding negotiations would probably lead to asimilar eonclusion and comparable agreements are likely in light castingsmanufacture, brass and copper rolling, constructional engineering andvehicle building.   The Y/ages Councils in holloware manufacture, keg anddrum, tin box manufacture, and stamped and pressed metal wares wouldprobably follow.   Engineering maintenance workers in other industries and the public sector would be affected to some extent.   Federatedengineering firms employ about 1-g- million manual workers and includingnon federated employers the total is about 2,1 million.   With repercussionsthe pay of some 3. million workers might be affected by an agreement,directly or indirectly.
