a document IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS GOVERNMENT)C(68) 87COPY NO.16 th Julvj..!^CABINETHOUSE OF LOORDS REFORMMemorand^im by the Lord ChancellorIntroductionThe Ministerial Committee on the House of Lords was invited toconsider what proposals the Government might put forward for the reform of the House of Lords in the light of the rejection by the Lords of theSouthern Rhodesia (United Nations Sanctions) Order, 1968 on 18th June(CC(68) 31st Conclusions, Minute 2, (Confidential Annex)).    At that timethe Inter-Party Conference had reached almost complete agreement on ascheme for the reform of the House of Lords which would have includedboth its powers and its composition.    The scheme was on the lines of theproposals set out in my memorandum of 28th January &quot;House of lords reform&apos;;   Report of the Progress of the Inter-Party Talks&quot; (C(68) 26)which the Cabinet endorsed on 1st February (CC(68) 11th Conclusions,Minute 3).    The proposals had also been considered and endorsed by the shadow Cabinet and by the leaders of the Liberal Party.    At the time ofthe lords  vote on the Rhodesia Order a draft White Paper had beenprepared by the Working Sub-Committee of the Conference, and had beenconsidered and approved by the Parliamentary Committee.    It was expectedthat the Conference would have considered and approved the draft afterone or two further meetings.2.      In the Cabinet discussion on 20th June it was decided that thePrime Minister should announce in the House of Commons that it wasthe intention of the Government to give effect to their intention to reform the House of Lords by introducing, at an early date, radical and comprehensive legislation on the lines which it judged appropriate.    Itwas further agreed that the Inter-Party consultations could not continue in the present circumstances, but it was left open whether they shouldbe resumed.    The Prime Minister made the statement the same afternoon.-1-
Possxblo Courses of Action3,   We have thought it unnecessary to examine three courses cf action whiohwe consider to be outside our terms of reference.     The first is the abolitionof the House of Lords, which was the subject of a Ten-Minute Rule Bill which mr. William Hamilton, MP, attempted to introduce on 26th June and which obtained 132 Labour votes when the motion for its introduction was lost inthe House of Commons by a vote of 223 to 132.     The reasons which may be advanced against such a course of action are setout in paragraph 5 of thedraft White Paper (reproduced in Annex B), and the   Prime Minister also stated, in a reply to a Supplementary Question on 20th June, that it was notthe policy of the Labour Party,,      The second course would be to revert tothe earlier proposal of reforming only the powers of the House of Lords and of leaving its composition unchanged.     The Ministerial Committee recommendedlast year, after long consideration, that there was no satisfactory way ofdealing with the Lords&apos; powers in isolation, and the Committee advised thatif the lords  powers only could be dealt with, no proposals for change should be introduced in the present Parliament (0(67) 14-5).     The Cabinetaccepted the Committee&apos;s recommendation on 7th September 19^7(CC(67) Conclusions, Minute 5).     Recent events have, in our view, donenothing to diminisn the strength of the arguments then deployed.4..   We have also rejected the possibility of doing nothing.     By doing nothingwe should be failing to implement the pledge in our election manifesto,, andsuch a course v/ould conflict with the statement in The Queen&apos;s Speech andwith the Prime Minister&apos;s statement on 20th June.     It would also beexceptionally dangerous, in present circumstances, not to take steps to protectour legislative programme from interference by the House of Lords in the finalsession of the Parliament.5.   Two courses of action therefore seemed to be open to us and within our terms of reference:(a) to introduce unilaterally a radical scheme for the reform of theHouse of Lords, on lines quite other than those proposed in the&apos;agreed reform&apos;, which would meet the views of some of our supporters in the House of Commons;(b) to introduce unilaterally a scheme similar to the agreed proposals but varied in detail in order to make them more acceptable to theLabour Party.-2-
Radical Reform6,    A new radical scheme might be thought likely to unite the Labour Partyby provoking a clear cut fight between left and right, both in parliament and in the country.     There would be several possibilities, none free fromdifficulty, but any of which the Ministerial Committee would consider indetail if so directed.     One would be some kind of elected second chamber,but this would be likely to result in rivalry between the two Houses and might therefore be thought to be unattractive.    Another would be to base the membership of the second House on a form of regional representation, but itwould be impossible to proceed with such a proposal until the reports of theRoyal Commissions on Local Government of England and Scotland have been published and implemented;   this would rule out the introduction oflegislation at the early date indicated in the Prime Minister&apos;s statement.The Conference rejected both these possibilities for the reasons whichare set out fully in paragraphs 9 and 10 of the draft white   Paper.A third possibility would be to bare the composition of the secondHouse not on the peerage but on membership of the Privy- Council;   thiswould provide a freehold to ensure the independence of the members cf the reformed House and might seem to members of the Labour Party to be a lessunattractive basis for the reformed House than the peerage.     There would,however, be practical difficulties in basing the composition of a reformed house on membership of the Privy Council, since it contains perhaps an even higher proportion of the elderly and inactive members than does the Houseof Lords and many of the most active members of the House would not, under present arrangements, be considered suitable for membership of the privy council.    Any such scheme would, however, remove the hereditary principlefrom Parliament at once and for ever.7.    Before we embark on the examination of the merits of these more radical suggestions in detail, however, we should consider the price whichwe should have to pay for them.     Since a virtually agreed plan for reformnow exists, the Conservative Party in both Houses would be bound to resiststrongly any Government decision to proceed unilaterally particularly since,although we have a mandate to reform the powers of the House of Lords, vie havenone to reform its composition.     They would certainly oblige us to apply the provisions of the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949.     To do this would inevitably cause a major disturbance in our legislative programme.    We givehi the Annex an account of the ways in which a House of Lords Reform bill might be passed by making use of the Parliament Aot procedure, from whioh itwill be seen that in no circumstances could a House of Lords Reform Bill-3-
SECRET / /iqMy&quot;be passed into law before December 19^9.     It would probably be necessaryto reorganise the final sessions of the Parliament so as to hold a shortextra session of some 6-8 weeks in October-November i 9^9 j    and it wouldcertainly be necessary to shorten considerably the main session of 1969-70.We must also recognise that the whole of our programme for the next18 months would be at risk in the House of Lords since the Conservativemajority would no longer have any incentive to oo-operate with theGovernment in the passage of its legislation.     In the present state of party representation in the House of Lords, the G-overnment is whollydependent upon the co-operation of the Opposition for achieving itslegislative programme.     At present this co-operation is forthcomingbecause the Lords know that they exist on sufferance, and also becausethey normally respect a working convention which allows a government of the left to govern in normal circumstances and while it is not to the advantageof the Conservative majority to force a general election.     It isimpossible to say exactly how great a disturbance of the present goodworking relations with the Opposition in the Lords would flow from anattempt to deal unilaterally with the powers and composition of the House,but it is highly probable that the G-overnment&apos;s programme of legislation in the next 18 months would suffer.     It is also highly probable that wecould not begin the final session of this Parliament until January 1970which might prevent us from holding a general election in the autumn of1970.     It is indeed possible that the Lords would refuse to pass essentiallegislation and that the G-overnment might then find itself forced to holda general election in circumstances which might not be favourable to ourselves.Variations in detail from the Scheme prepared by the Conference8,     If a radical new solution is thought to be impracticable, an alternative would be to take the present scheme as it now stands and to vary it in ways which would enable it to win greater support from our oral supporters inthe Labour Party.     Obvious possibilities would be to reduce the Lords1powers, for example by reducing the perxod. of delay after disagreement between the Houses from six months to three, or by substituting a &apos;period for consideration&apos;;    or to remove at once the rump of hereditary Peers(instead of allowing existing Peers by succession to retain speaking rights in the reformed House for life).     Another possibility would be that only those hereditary Peers who are Privy Counsellors should be given theopportunity of a life Peerage at the time of the reform although thissuggestion was considered and rejected by Ministers  in July 1967.-4-SECRET
9.     All these could he further considered;   but there -would nevertheless be serious disadvantages in making changes of any kind in the agreed proposals.     The details of the proposed &quot;package&apos; are known to a considerablenumber of people, including both the Cabinet and the Shadow Cabinet.Already some of the proposals have been &quot;leaked&quot; and we must face the factthat more details will inevitably become public knowledge.     The resultmust be that any significant variations made to the proposals in the draft white Paper would be recognised, as such, and the Conservative Party would therefore be bound to resist them.     This means in effect that no worthwhilevariations on the scheme in the draft White Paper could be agreed, eithertacitly or openly, and any significant changes would have to be foughtthrough, making use of the Parliament Act procedure and with all the disadvantages outlined in paragraph 7 above.     An agreed plan with ninorchanges, imposed unilaterally, would therefore seem to offer no advantage:it would not only kill all prospect of agreement but it would, also stimulate the extremists both in the Labour Party and in the Conservative Party to oppose the proposals.     In these circumstances it is in our view doubtfulwhether a Bill could be carried into law.    We therefore believe thatdetailed variations from the agreed scheme would give us the worst of allworlds.10.   A general argument which applies to any decision to legislate unilaterallyis that the Conservatives would be likely to introduce their own unilaterallegislation if returned to office.     The result might be that their scheme,unlike the scheme agreed by the Inter-Party Conference, would be damaging to the long-term interests of the Labour Party:   it might, for example,leave the House with much greater powers, especially on subordinate legislation, which if linked with the agreed proposals on composition wouldbe extremely difficult for a future Labour government to reduce.Conclusions11.   It will be seen that both a radical scheme and variations in detailfrom the present scheme would present considerable difficulty, although weshould prefer the former if a choice had to be made.     The alternative isto take the present scheme as it stands and to proceed with the preparationof legislation based upon it which would then be ready for introduction in the autumn.     In the meantime we could keep the Opposition guessing asto our intentions and thus hope to hold the Lords on good behaviour.     Atan opportune moment towards the end of the Session, we would decide whethertactically it would be better to present the Bill as our own scheme orwhether to resume talks with the Opposition, with a view to the publicationof an agreed White Paper and the subsequent introduction of an agreed Bill.-5-
12.   We therefore invite our colleagues to consider whether we should -(a)   start work on the preparation of a new radical scheme;   or(h)   proceed with the preparation of a Bill on the basis of the agreed proposals, and reserve until the autumn the decision whether to proceed unila.term  .lly or to resume discussions with theOpposition.The majority of the Committee preferred the second of these alternatives.&amp;.House of Lords, S.Y/.1.16th July 1968-6-
ANNEX AThe Implications for the Legislative Programme of applying the parliament Act Procedure to a Bill to reform theHouse of lords the present Parliament Act procedure involves the passing of the sameBill hy the Commons in two successive sessions;   a minimum interval of twelve months between the date of its second reading in the House ofCommons in the first Session and Its passing hy the Commons in the second session;   and a period of one month for consideration hy the Lords ineach Session.     If it were decided to force through a unilateral measure to reform the House of Lords hy making use of this procedure, two courseswould he open.     The first would he to prolong the current session forsuch period as was necessary both to enable the Bill to pass through all its stages in the Commons and to enable it to be rejected by the Lords:this would mean that the next session could not start before January 1 %9at the earliest.     The alternative would be to introduce the Bill for thefirst time next session, which would then start as planned.     In either case the Government would face a major dislocation of its legislativeplans.2.    Whichever course was adopted, there would he little difference inthe date at which Royal Assent could he secured.     Introduction next session would probably lead to Royal Assent in December 19^9;introduction this session could not advance this date by more than a fewweeks.Bill introduced this session3.     If it were decided to introduce the Bill for the first time duringthe current session, the timetable would depend on how soon the bill could be made ready.     In theory, time might be saved by recalling theHouse of Commons in September for long enough to enable the Bill toreceive a Second Reading;   but it would he wholly unrealistic to assume that any new proposals could be worked out and a Bill drafted in soshort a time.     If the Bill were introduced in mid-October it would hardly be possible - unless the Lords co-operated by rejecting it on second Reading - to bring the session to an end before late January.Later introduction would involve protracting the session still further.
4.     The legislative programme approved hy the Cabinet for 1968-69,including Bills on Tourism but not Industrial Relations, is estimated to require 55 parliamentary days;   this is about the average time whichhas been available for G-overnment legislation in recent years, assumingnormal recesses and no autumn fspill-over&apos;.     If the new session werenot opened until the beginning of February, something like 20 daysotherwise available for legislation would be lost;   Bills could not enter on their Committee Stage before the beginning of March.     Sometime would be gained by having an autumn ^pill-over1 (see below), andthe Whitsun Recess might be cut, but this could not make good the lossof time at the beginning of the session;    cuts in the programme wouldbe necessary, particularly in the case of longer Bills.     In particular,so late a. start to the session would make it very difficult to pass the representation of the People Bill in time for the general election tobe held on the basis of the new-style register;   and there might becomplications in the grant of Winter and Spring Supply.     The G-overnmentwould also be at risk of having its other legislation rejected by the lords, although the Bills planned for the 1968-69 session are not for themost part likely to prove acutely controversial politically.5.     On the assumption that the Bill to reform the House of Lordsobtained a Second Reading in the Commons in late October this year itwould be necessary to extend the following session until almost theend of November 1969 to meet the requirements of the Parliament Act.The 1969-70 session would then be correspondingly shortened.Bill introduced next session6.     If the new session were opened as planned and the Bill were introduced at the beginning of November there would be no loss ofparliamentary time during the 1 968-69 session.     The risk that theGovernmentls other legislation would be rejected by the Lords would however remain.7.     Since Parliament Act procedure requires a minimum interval of twelve months between the date of the Second Reading of the Bill in theHouse of Commons in the first session and its passing by the Commons inthe second session, the latter could not therefore take place beforemid-November 1969, which would point to the session being opened inOctober.     This in itself would not disturb the legislative programme;-8-SECKET
194V t   .6..-      9bu-b difficulty arises from the fact that it would probably be necessaryto prorogue Parliament in December 196$.     If the Lords decided not to reject the Bill, but simply to play for time, bringing the session toan end might be the only way of establishing that they had not passed the Bill and so making the Parliament Act bite.     It would in any case be extremely awkward to bring into effect a major change in the composition of one House of Parliament during the course of a session.8.     If the opening of what would otherwise have been the 19&amp;9-70session had to be delayed until January 1970, there would be serious consequences for the legislative programme for that session.     nearly one-third of the days which would ordinarily have been available for legislation would have been lost, and reliance could not be placed onthe extension of the session into the autumn without compromising the government&apos;s freedom of manoeuvre in relation to an autumn generalelection.     Long Bills, such as the Ports, Merchant Shipping andIndustrial relations Bills, would be particularly at risk.

THE RKffORM OF THE HOUSE OF LORDSI - THE BACKGROUND TO THE REFORM-in m..........innwi i.ii......imiiiwiin.....wwwi-w.ii.f mnwurn...........f11mmimn i* 11......Introduction^\     The task of the Conference was to consider and make recommenda-tions on the reform of the composition and powers of the House of Lords,following the announcement of the G-overnment&apos; s intention to introduce such a reform in the Queen&apos;s Speech at the opening of Parliament on31st October 1967.2,    We held our first meeting on 8th November 1967, and met subsequentlyon        occasions.   We were assisted by a Working Sub-Committee consistingof Lord Shackleton, Lord Jellicoe and Lord Byers who met on f 35,/occasions.   They commissioned a number of statistical and other studies,gave preliminary consideration to the problems which presented themselves and prepared many of the papers on which our eventual conclusions were based.   Originally it seemed possible that we might complete our work within two or three months and so allow time for any legislation to beintroduced within the present session!   but when it became clear that we might reach agreement on a comprehensive and far-reaching scheme of reform,we thought it important to prepare our proposals in the degree of detailwhich a reform of such magnitude requires.   For these reasons it hastaken us some eight months to complete our work.3.    We have thought it right to consider all aspects of the composition,:&apos; - &apos;-J:v :; &quot; &apos;:: &apos;/    .&apos;.    &apos; : .&apos;. &apos; . &apos;    &apos;      &quot;, &apos; - . :   ,: :, ,&apos;: :    &quot;.y   &apos;   &apos;     .: :   &apos; .   :. ... . :. ; &apos;;   ::&apos;..; .;!.       :-      :, ::      y&apos;:    &apos;&apos;       .V:   &apos; .&apos; -:   &apos;::&apos;: &apos;        :. ;   :     &apos;..     -   , &apos;and powers of the House of Lords which bear on its functions as thesecond chamber of Parliament, and in particular on its role as a debatingand legislative chamber.   We have agreed to the scheme for the reform ofthe House of Lords which is set out in the following paragraphs of this paper.   Part I (paragraphs k to 37) deals in general terms with the historical, constitutional and political background to our proposals;Part II (paragraphs 38 to 75) describes our proposals in detail.   Werecommend that our proposals should now be fully discussed by bothHouses of Parliament.
l.    As soon as we started work, it became clear that the extent ofthe agreement on the oentral issues was a great deal wider than manyhad expected.   In particular - although we naturally approached theproblem from different points of view - we found we were unanimous inbelieving that:(a) in the framework of a modern parliamentary system the second chamber has an essential role to play, complementary to, butnot rivalling, that of the Commons.   The objective of the reform should therefore be to ensure the more efficient workingof Parliament as a whole.   Once the reform has been completed the functions of the House of Lords should expand as the workof the two Houses becomes more closely co-ordinated and integrated(b) a change of such constitutional magnitude and of such importanceto Parliament and to the country as a whole should, if possible,be brought about not by majority decision but by inter-partyagreement.5.    We were unanimous in our support for reforming the second chamber,but we were aware that single-chamber government has its staunch supporters.As a preliminary, it was therefore necessary to examine the case forabolishing the House of Lords, or alternatively for stripping it soradically of its powers and functions that the House of Commons would becomein effect the sole organ of parliamentary government.   We observed in thefirst place that a move towards single-chamber government would be contraryto the practice of every other parliamentary democracy which has to legis-late for a large population.   Indeed the case for two-chamber governmenthas been strengthened since the end of the Second World War by the growth in the volume and complexity of legislation, as well as by the increasein the activity and power of the Executive and in its use of subordinate legislation.   To abolish the House of Lords would in effect strengthen the
Executive at the expense of Parliament and ultimately of the individual.Moreover, in terms of this country*s experience, abolition of the Houseof Lords would subject the House of Commons to severe strain, and para-doxically might result in less procedural flexibility and speed becauseof the need to safeguard against the overhasty passage of legislation.6.    Apart from providing the supreme court of appeal, the House ofLords performs the following main functions:(a) the provision of a forum for full and free debate on mattersof public interest!(b) the revision of public bills brought from the House of Commons;(c) the initiation of public legislation, including in particularthose government bills which are less controversial in party political terms and private members&apos; bills;(d) the consideration of delegated legislation;(e) the scrutiny of the activities of the Executive;   and(f) the scrutiny of private legislation.In each of these areas, except the last, the volume of work performed bythe House of Lords has been increasing in recent years, and the desira-bility of closer co-operation with the House of Commons is becoming more widely recognised.   In all these areas the House of Lords makes a valuable contribution and its present composition,particularly with the growth inthe number of life peers, provides a means of bringing into Parliamentincreasing numbers of people of wide experience and specialist knowledge.Many of these would not wish to serve in the House of Commons because oftheir personal inclinations or the nature of their work.   In a periodtherefore when the House of Commons is finding it increasingly difficultto cope with the detailed scrutiny and control which modern legislationimposes upon it, we think it would be foolish to impose upon it the verylarge additional obligations which abolition of the House of Lords would entail.   In fact part of our objective in ensuring the more efficient working of Parliament as a whole must be to relieve the House of commons of some of its detailed responsibilities.-6-SECRET
7,    If abolition of the House of Lords is rejected, the possibilityof leaving its composition unchanged but still further reducing its powers had also to be considered.   To leave its composition unchanged whileremoving most of its remaining powers of delay would transform the upper house simply into a debating chamber, but if it had no ^worthwhilefunction to perform/  ^effective powers/, distinguished men and women wouldbe reluctant to become members.   The distinctive contribution which theupper House has increasingly been making to parliamentary activity wouldthen be lost.   So far from strengthening the Commons, an attempt toemasculate the Lords would impose burdens upon the Commons which would bedifficult for them to sustain.8,    There remained one further alternative to reform of the House ofLords:   that there should be no change either in its composition or in its powers.   We could not accept this alternative because we do not believethat an unreformed House of Lords is compatible with our objective of ensuring the more efficient working of Parliament as a whole.   We are convinced that there is a general public demand that our parliamentaryinstitutions should be made more effective, and that the reform of theHouse of Lords is an essential part of this process.   We also believe thatthe character of a parliamentary institution should be such that itsrelationship with a government of one political persuasion is no different from its relationship with a government of another.   To make no change atall would be to preserve an inbuilt majority for one major party, and undermodern conditions this has the paradoxical result that while the House ofLords normally offers small check on a government of the right, the threat to a government of the left is suoh that it cannot easily be brought into play without the risk of involving both Houses in a constitutional crisis.Although the House has become increasingly effective in recent years, nosecond chamber can be fully effective in such circumstances and, at a timewhen the demands on Parliament are increasing, we do not believe that itffould any longer be respectable to leave the House in a state which prevents
it from making the fullest contribution of which it is capable.Possible schemes of reform9,    For these reasons we were convinced that there is no sensible alterna-tive to reforming the House of Lords.   We therefore examined a number of well-known proposals which have been made at various times.   The first group of proposals relies on the principle that a modern second chambershould derive its authority from the popular vote.   One suggestion hasbeen to introduce direct election by the electorate which chooses the commons.   An obvious method of making this change would be to follow the example of Norway where some of the members elected in a general electiongo to the lower house and the remainder to the upper house.   There arestrong arguments of logic for this suggestion:   it seems both radical andrational since it would make clear the source of the political authorityof the upper House, and it would successfully eliminate an inbuilt perma-nent majority for any one party.   Alternatively, the upper House could be elected indirectly, or by larger and different constituencies and forlonger periods than the House of Commons.   Whether or not a House ofLords reformed in this way became a senior and influential chamber, likethe Senate of the United States of America, would largely depend upon thesystem by which its members were elected and upon the powers it possessed;but whatever the system of eleotion and whatever its powers, a directly elected second chamber must inevitably become a rival to the House ofCommons.   Since it too would possess a mandate from the people it mightwell be driven to make a claim for equal powers, and in particular to challenge the present control by the Commons of finance and supply.   Adirectly elected second chamber fits well enough into a constitution basedon a division of powers between two chambers (most often found in connec-tion with a federal system of government) but it would violate the cen-tral principle of our present British parliamentary system by which ithas been reoognised, at least since the beginning of the nineteenth century, that the government stands or falls in the House of Commons.
10.  The second possibility w&amp;uM^^njjuper House constituted on a-- j 3regional basiaj   for example, indirectly elected or nominated by localauthorities.   But a House composed on this principle would still be opento the dangers resulting from the probability of rivalry between theHouses, although possibly not in such an acute form as if it were directly elected.   We certainly think it essential to include in the reformed house members both from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and fromthe regions of England, but we do not think that it would be ^possible//^practicable^ at this stage to respond to the current demand for national or regional government by seeking to establish a reformed second chamberon a regional basis.   There do not at present exist the national or regionalinstitutions which could provide the machinery for selection for such achamber, and it is difficult to see how the selection could be made throughthe existing system of local government.   Local government elections takeplace at different times from general elections, and a government with amajority in the House of Commons could well find itself in a minority inthe House of Lords.   Many believe that a radical reconstruction of localgovernment is in any event long over-due, and two Royal Commissions aresubjecting the present system to detailed and comprehensive inquiry.   Itis relevant that in countries where there is an effective upper house basedon some form of regional or local representation - for example, in theUnited States of America or in Australia - it is usually part of a federalsystem of government such as does not exist in this country.   Finally, achamber which was based on any form of regional representation would inevitably-tably alter the relationship between members of Parliament and theirconstituents.11.   Having rejected both elections, either direct or indirect, and a house based on regional representation, we turned to proposals for improving the present system of nomination.   One suggestion was that the reformed house should consist solely of peers nominated for the life of oneparliament.   The party membership of the House of Lords in each parliament would, then be arranged broadly to reflect the balance of parties in thelower House.   The main attraction of this proposal is that without recourse
GRET10-to elections it would remove the inbuilt majority for a single party which is one of the acknowledged defects of the present chamber and would replace it by an assured majority for the government of the day;   thisattraction, however, is more than outweighed by the reduction in theindependence of the individual peer and of the House as a whole which thechange would inevitably bring with it.   A House composed in this way wouldin effect reproduce the composition of the House of Commons and repeat itsopinions and decisions;   it would therefore be incapable of carrying outeffectively the complementary functions which we all -wish the reformedsecond chamber to perform.   Further, if members of the House of Lords were appointed afresh after each general election, powers of patronage would inevitably be greatly increased since in order to be re-selected a peerwould have to remain acceptable to the party managers.   Our considerationof this proposal in fact strengthened our view that the &quot;freehold&apos; which apeer enjoys under the present system must be preserved in a reformed House.We return to this point in paragraph 29 below.Characteristics of the House of Lords12.  Having considered and rejected all these proposals for what would havebeen virtually a new upper chamber, we came to the conclusion that the presentneeds of Parliament require not a revolutionary but an evolutionary reform of the House of Lords.   In the last 15 years, both the effective size ofthe working House and the character of its activities have been changingrapidly.   In particular, the introduction of life peerages under the LifePeerages Act 1958 resulted in a marked increase in   the vigour and effect-iveness of the House, especially as a forum for debate and as a scrutinisingand revising chamber, and attendance figures are more than double thoseof 15 years ago.   The Aot also allowed the attendance of women in theHouse and their presence is now welcomed and their contribution to debateis valued.   The House of Lords has the advantage of greater proceduralflexibility than is possible in the House of Commons;   and since it needs to spend less time on ephemeral political questions, and has little or no responsibility in matters of finance or supply, it can find more time for
debates on subjects of public concern, many of which are not matters of party or political dispute.   It is particularly well equipped to considerspecialist or technical legislation, for example, matters of law reform,and in recent years it has been notable as the starting place for a numberof controversial private members&apos; bills involving difficult and importantmoral issues.   On the other hand the development of these qualities hasalso tended to emphasise those features of its composition which are in-appropriate to modern conditions.   We therefore agreed that our aim must beto remove these anachronistic features while retaining the very real virtueswhich the second chamber has developed, especially in recent years.    In con-sidering how this could be achieved we felt it wise to remind ourselves of previous attempts at reform in recent years and to consider the causes oftheir failure.Previous attempts at reform13.  The movement to restrict the powers of the House of Lords grew in intensity in the late nineteenth century from a combination of circumstancesconnected with the increasingly popular character of the House of Commons:the progress towards universal suffrage, the widening differences betweenthe political parties, and the development of the party machines.   At thesame time, the House of Lords became more and more a House of one party.The process culminated in the Lords&apos; attacks on the radical legislation ofthe Liberal G-overnment elected in 1906, notably Lloyd G-eorge1 s Budget of1909.   A bill was therefore introduced to limit the power of the Lords to frustrate decisions of the Commons - a power which had hitherto beenunrestricted except to the extent that it was limited by the Commons&apos;financial privilege.   Before this bill finally became law in 1911, theparty leaders attempted to reach an agreement but they failed amidst theviolent controversies over Irish Home Rule and other issues.The Parliament Act 1911 in effect removed the Lords&apos; power to rejectmoney bills and provided that an ordinary public bill could become law
despite the lords  opposition if passed by the Commons in three successivesessions, with not less than two years elapsing between second reading inthe House of Commons in the first session and the final passing of thebill in the House of Commons in the third session.   The Act thus gave agovernment the ability to carry through against the Lords&apos; oppositionany legislation introduced in the first two sessions of a five-yearparliament.   Nevertheless, the Lords were left with real powers of delay,which were promptly used on the Welsh Church Bill and on the Governmentof Ireland Bill:    the new Parliament Act procedure was applied to bothbefore they were eventually enacted in 1914.15.   These arrangements were however meant as a temporary expedient:    asthe preamble to the Parliament Act 1911 makes clear, it was thought thata thorough reform of the House of Lords would take place before long.   the preamble states:&quot;and whereas it is intended to substitute for the House of Lords asit at present exists a second chamber constituted on a popularinstead of hereditary basis, but such substitution cannot immediately be brought into operation...&quot;After 1911, however, continuing political troubles and the First World Warprevented further action until the Conference appointed under the chairman-(1)ship of Lord Bryce in 1917 , whose Report (Cd 9038) proposed a House three-quarters of whose members would consist of persons indirectly elected bymembers of the House of Commons on a regional basis, and one quarter ofpersons chosen by a joint standing committee of both Houses, with certainproportions of hereditary peers and bishops.   The scheme made no progressbecause of the dissent of some members of the Conference and the politicalcircumstances at the time.(1)   Its terms of reference were &quot;To inquire and report - (i)   as to thenature and limitations of the legislative powers to be exercised by are formed Second Chamber,   (ii)   as to the best mode of adjustingdifferences between the two Houses of Parliament,   (iii)   as to the changes which are desirable in order that the Second Chamber may in futurehe so constituted as to exercise fairly the functions appropriate to aSecond Chamber.&quot;SECRET
](3,   Between the two World Wars, a series of further proposals was madefor the wholesale reconstruction of the House but nothing came of them.In its election manifesto of 1945 the Labour party pledged itself not topermit its legislative programme to be obstructed by the House of Lords,and in 1947 the Labour G-overnment brought forward a Parliament Bill.   this bill proposed a reduction in the number of sessions&apos; delay from three to two and in the period of delay from second reading in the House of Commonsfrom two years to one.   The Bill was first passed by the Commons at the endof 1947*   The second reading debate in the House of Lords was adjourned sothat the proposals in the Bill could be considered at a conference of party leaders.   At this conference the Labour representatives were prepared toagree to a period of delay of nine months from the third reading of a billin the House of Commons as an alternative to the period proposed in the Bill;the Liberal party&apos;s representatives concurred, but those of the conservative party felt unable to agree to a period of delay of less than one year from third reading on the first occasion in the House of Commons.   The Labourparty&apos;s representatives rejected this alternative on the ground that itcould prevent the enactment of controversial legislation introduced in thefourth session of a parliament.   No agreement was therefore reached and the parliament Bill was eventually enaoted in 1949 under the provisions of the parliament Act 1911.17.  Although the Conference of 1948 reached no agreement on powers, it madesubstantial progress towards finding a basis for agreement on the composition of a reformed House.   This is shown in the agreed statement published as a white Paper (Cd 7380) after the breakdown of discussions.   Paragraph 5states that if agreement could have been reached generally, further consid-eration would have been given to reform of composition on the following basis(a)   The second chamber should be complementary to and not a rival tothe lower House, and, with this end in view, the reform of theHouse of Lords should be based on a modification of its existing constitution as opposed to the establishment of a second chamberof a completely new type based on some system of election.
(b) The revised constitution of the House of Lords should be such .as to secure as far as practicable that a permanent majority isnot assured for any one political party.(c) The present right to attend and vote based solely on heredityshould not by itself constitute a qualification for admission to a reformed second chamber.(d) Members of the second chamber should be styled &quot;Lords ofParliament&apos; and would be appointed on grounds of personaldistinction or public service.   They might be drawn either fromhereditary peers, or from commoners who would be created life peers.(e) Women should be capable of being appointed Lords of parliament in like manner as men.(f) Provision should be made for the inclusion in the second chamberof certain descendants of the Sovereign, certain lords spiritualand the law lords.(g) In order that persons without private means should not be excluded,some remuneration would be payable to members of the second chamber.(h) Peers who were not Lords of Parliament should be entitled to stand for election to the House of Commons, and also to vote at elections in the same manner as other citizens.(i) Some provision should be made for the disqualification of amember of the second chamber who neglects, or becomes no longerable or fitted, to perform his duties as such.18,  It will be noted that the changes of the last 15 years - in particular the introduction of life peers, the payment of expenses, and the presenceof women - have all been in accordance with the above statement of principles which in our view correctly signposted the path of evolutionary reform.The fact that so large a measure of agreement had become possible illustrates the remarkable extent to which the temper of controversy about House oflords reform had moderated between 1911 and 1948.   The process has continuedeven more swiftly sinoe 1948, and all our discussions showed that, however
Total 1,056In this paper, we describe peers who sit by right of succession to ahereditary title as peers by succession;   all other members of the House -i,e. categories (b)-(e) above, - we describe as nominated peers.(1)    Created under the Life Peerages Act 1958(2)    Created peers for life under the Appellate Jurisdiction Acts 1876-1947(3)    Consisting of the two archbishops, and 24 senior diocesan bishopsof the established church in England who leave the House on retirement from their sees.   Bishops are not, strictly speaking,peers but are lords spiritual and lords of Parliament.-15-violently the nation may be divided on other problems, in the sphere ofparliamentary reform a political olimate has developed in which there ia  &apos;a real opportunity for achieving the reform of the second chamber on thebasis of agreement.The present House of Lords - Composition19,   Following this short account of some of the previous attempts atreform, it may be convenient to examine the main characteristics of theHouse of Lords as it is today and particularly those which prevent it fromdeveloping its full utility as a chamber complementary to the House ofCommons.20.   In May 1968 the House consisted of:(a) 742 hereditary peers by succession(b) 123 hereditary peers of first creation(c) 144 life peers ^(2)(d) 21 serving or retired law lords v &apos;(e) 26 bishops ^
21,  The membership of the House of Lords has increased sharply since-1^00 (when it was 590) because frequent new creations have been made and because until the introduction of life peerages in 1958 all new membersof the House (except Lords of Appeal in Ordinary and bishops) werecreated hereditary peers.   This led to a steady increase both in the totalsize of the House and in the number of its inactive members, of whom thereare now well over 300.22.   Of the 65O-7OO peers who ever attend the House, some 25O attend veryrarely indeed;   about 200 attend from time to time (generally in connec-tion with debates or legislation which particularly interest them) and afurther 230 or so attend at least one-third of the sittings and form theworking House.   Of the 270 or so nominated peers who attend the Houseabout 60 attend very rarely indeed, about 65 attend from time to time and\lJo are members of the working House.   About 400 speak during a session ofwhom about 200 are nominated peers.   Figures for voting are divided almostequally between nominated peers and peers by succession.   The average dailyattendance is at present about 225;   this figure compares with   92 in 1955and 1*t0 in 1963.23.   There is a striking difference between the political composition ofthe whole House on the one hand, and of the working House on the other.Taking the House as a whole, including those peers who attend only occasion-ally, we find that about 35O peers take the Conservative whip, about 110take the Labour whip, and about 45 take the Liberal whip.   The remaindertake no party whip.   Of the 23O who attended regularly during the lastcomplete session, about 105 took the Conservative whip, about 80 took theLabour whip, about 15 took the Liberal whip and about 30 took no partywhip.   Since those who take no party whip usually sit on the cross benches,they are commonly known as &apos;cross benchers&apos;.24. &apos;Cross benchers&apos; are a particular, feature of the House of Lords and include a wide range of individuals who for one reason or another prefer
CRET141to accept no party allegiance.1)We examined detailed record;? which showthat they speak and vote on issues as they see them and do not regularlyadhere to one party.   Many have full-time occupations outside the house and for this reason they tend to come infrequently until they retire;but after retirement many give a period of regular service to the House.Some of the most influential speeches by cross benchers have been made by those who come rarely.   The records show that they do not act in any way as an organised group or possess a sense of corporate identity.The present House of Lords - Powers25.  The House of Lords has the same right to initiate and to delay orrevise legislation as the House of Commons (subject to the Commons&apos; finan-cial privilege), except that under the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949it cannot delay a money bill for longer than one month and for other publicbills, apart from a bill to prolong the life of a parliament, the delay isonly for a limited period.   The essential feature is that a period of oneyear must elapse between second reading in the House of Commons in thefirst session and third reading in the House of Commons in the next.   Inpractice this provision means that a bill to which the Lords are opposedcan never be passed in less than 13 months from the original second reading of the bill in the House of Commons and in some circumstances the periodcould well be substantially longer.   The effective delay which the Houseof Lords can cause is however much less than this, since the period of13 months includes the time needed for the bill to pass through all its stages in the House of Commons after second reading and also the time whichthe House of Lords takes to consider the bill up to the point of disagree-ment.   Nevertheless,if a bill is not introduced until towards the end of a parliament,it may be lost altogether.   Subordinate legislation, private bills(1)  The present list of nominated cross benchers includes many former servants of the Crown, - 7 diplomats, 4 civil servants, 8 servicemen, 3 colonialadministrators - as well as 4 scientists, 3 doctors, 3 technologists,h- dons, 2 press lords, 4 lawyers, 6 businessmen and industrialists,2 farmers and 2 churchmen.
and bills to confirm provisional orders or which come within the scopeof the Private Legislation Procedure (Scotland) Act 1936 are exempt fromthe limitations of the Parliament Acts.26,   Changes in the nature and methods of the legislative process have con-siderably increased the effective powers of the House of Lords despite the limitations imposed by the Parliament Acts in relation to public bills.Over a wide field, which tends to expand as the processes of legislation and of government become more complex, provisions supplementary to legis-lation are left to be made by subordinate legislation i.e. by Order inCouncil or departmental order or regulation.   The enactments conferringthese powers normally include provision for Parliament to supervise theiruse5 the substance of which is either that an instrument made under thepower may be annulled by resolution of either House or that such an instru-ment cannot come into force (or remain in force) unless approved by resolu-tion of each House.   Except in the fields of taxation and other financial matters, these provisions give parallel powers to both Houses.   the parliament Acts do not apply, and the House of Commons has no means ofoverriding a decision of the House of Lords which conflicts with its own.The result of the increase in the use of subordinate legislation is thatthe scope for the Lords to use their powers in order to override the Commonshas in fact grown considerably since the passage of the Parliament Act 1911.27.  Whereas the formal powers of the House of Lords are considerable andhave increased in scope with the larger use of subordinate legislation,  inpractice its final powers of delay over public legislation and of rejection of subordinate legislation have remained largely unused.   They do howevergive the Lords considerable influence, which they use in amending billsbrought to them in the course of the ordinary legislative process ofscrutiny and revision.   Governments are naturally more ready to acceptamendments on matters which do not involve major party political controv-ersy, and for this reason the Lords&apos; influence has been felt most frequentlyon private members&apos; bills and on those government bills which have been less controversial in party political terms.   The Lords have nevertheless
I made their influence felt on party political issues, by governments both. .0C the right and of the left but their influence,and the threat of theuse of their powers, have had a more important bearing on the majorlegislative proposals of governments of the left - for example, the delaysI forced upon the Labour G-overnment on the Iron and Steel Bill, 1949.   Onsubordinate legislation there have also been a few occasions when orders have not been proceeded with because of known opposition in the House ofLords.   But the fact remains that since 1914 the only bill actually passed into law against the continuing opposition of the Lords was the ParliamentBill of 1947, and there has not been a single occasion since the Secondflorid War when the Lords have rejected outright an item of subordinate legislation.   The reason is clear:   the composition of the House of Lordsis such that it cannot persist in its opposition to a measure upon whichthe Commons are determined without the risk of provoking a constitutionalcrisis.   Nevertheless, the possibility that the Lords might use theirformal powers remains a political fact with which every non-conservative government must reckon, particularly after its third year in office.Principles of reform28.   In tackling the complex and inter-related problems of composition and powers we found it convenient to begin with composition.   Consideredexclusively in terms of a working House, the problem did not at firstappear difficult.   A possible solution would be to exclude peers by successionaltogether, leaving a House with a total membership of 250-300 composedexclusively of nominated peers.   At present there are 92 Labour, 76 Conserv-ative, 13 Liberal /and 89 cross bench/&apos; nominated peers who attend the House/[making a total of 270^7?   but these figures conceal a difficulty which isthat in working terms (i,e, those who attend one-third of the sittings)the figures are much more unequal - 76 Labour, 39 Conservative, 8 Liberal /and23 cross benchers (making a total of 146)7.   A suitable number of new life peers would have to be made therefore in order to give the government ofthe day a majority and a reasonable distribution between the parties.
The understanding would be that under such a scheme each incoming PrimeMinister would have the right to achieve a modest majority over theopposition parties by means of further new creations.   This solution hasthe virtue of simplicity,but it became clear that it did not provide thebasis for an agreed reform.   Indeed, the more carefully we considered itthe more each member of the Conference became convinced that such asolution would violate, the principle of evolutionary change which wefavour.   In the first place it could not be denied that the effectiveworking of the present House owes much to the active participation of anumber of existing hereditary peers;   and secondly, a number of the crossbench peers and others, whose experience and independence give the Houseone of its special qualities, would feel unable to remain members of acomparatively small whole-time House whose enlarged responsibilities wouldrequire regular attendance.29,   In rejecting this solution we became convinced that in our attempts to solve the problems of composition and powers we should try to achieve two main objectives.   The first was that if a reformed House is to have theauthority which an effective second chamber requires, it must preserve and indeed develop the quality of independence which is to be found among thepresent membership of the House,   The second objective was that thegovernment of the day, of whatever party it might be, should be able tomake the fullest use of those qualities and opportunities which the reformed house would offer.   The independence to be found in the House of Lords atpresent results from the participation of a considerable number of part-time members distinguished in many professions who can from time to timemake contributions of high quality and also from the presence of a numberof cross benchers who owe no allegiance to any party.   Equally important is the &quot;freehold&apos; to which we have referred in paragraph 11 above - thefact that a peer, having once become a peer, cannot be deprived of hisseat in the House.   This freenold enables all peers, including thosebelonging to the parties, to act with a real measure of independence.
fte have ample evidence that they do this at present and we think ithighly desirable that these characteristics should be preserved in any &quot; -reformed House.3O.  As for the use which the government of the day would make of are formed House, we do not think that a government could be expected to take full advantage of the qualities and opportunities of a second chamber, nor to encourage the development of its functions, without a reasonableexpectation that its measures would normally be passed without undue delay.For this reason any government should therefore have a majority of theparty membership of the working House which would be sufficient for thispurpose.   These two objectives must inevitably conflict to some extent and we think it essential for any proposals for reform to attempt to recon-cile them so far as possible.31.   In order to achieve these two objectives we found ourselvesincreasingly attracted to a two-tier approach to the question of compo-sition - i.e.  a scheme which would divide the future membership into two groups, voting peers and speaking peers.   Voting peers would constitute the &quot;working House&apos; in whom the effective power of decision would reside.In particular they would be responsible for the bulk of the work arisingfrom the legislative functions of the House.   These duties require regularattendance and would not be appropriate for those who can attend onlyoccasionally.   Voting peers would include every nominated peer who was prepared to accept, for the term of a parliament at a time, the responsibility-ities of regular attendance;   in the first instance the number of nominatedpeers available to serve in the working House would be increased, to theextent necessary to create a viable House and to achieve political balance,by conferring life peerages on a number of active peers by succession.The government would have a majority of the party membership, but in orderto preserve the measure of independence which we consider essential itwould not have a majority of the working House as a whole when those with-out party allegiance were also taken into account.   It follows that the
overnmerit1 a majority over the other parties would be small - perhapsten per cent of the total of the opposition parties - and that it wouldnot vary with the size of the government&apos;s majority in the House of Commons,incoming government would achieve its majority by means of a suitablenumber of new creations  \ an increase in the size of the voting house would be avoided if the older voting members retired from the votingHouse at general elections under a retirement rule (they would remain in theHouse for life as speaking peers )J7.32.   Speaking peers would consist of all the other members of the House ofLords at the time of the reform, including the existing peers by succession.Froa! that date, all future accessions to the upper chamber would be bynomination to a peerage and not by succession.   Instead of being eliminatedat one stroke the hereditary element would thus disappear gradually.   Inthis way it would be possible to retain in the House those distinguished menand women who could not attend regularly but would be able to make valuablecontributions from time to time.   They would include, for example, bothexperienced parliamentarians and. others who would be too old to contributeregular attendance, and leading members of the professions, includingscientists and technologists and also industrialists, businessmen and tradeunion leaders.   Many of these would still be active in their careers out-side the House and would therefore be unable to attend regularly, but whensubjects were being debated of which they had special knowledge or in whichthey had a special interest, their advice would be of great value.33. We believe that a two-tier chamber of this kind provides not only theessential method of transition from a largely hereditary to a wholly nominate-ated House;   equally important it maintains that blend of the active parlia-mentarian and the independent expert which gives the present House itsparticular distinction and character.   We think it would otherwise be im-possible to reconcile the two principles we have described in paragraph 29above, or to achieve a second chamber which would at once be strong enough for the legislative and other functions we hope to place upon it, and yetoffer scope for contributions of high quality from part-time members distin-distinguished in other walks of life.
fy.  Having considered the composition of the reformed House, we turned to the functions and powers which a House with this reformed compositionshould possess.   For the reasons we have stated in paragraphs 9 and 10above we did not believe that in our unitary British parliamentary systemit was necessary or desirable to redistribute political power between thetwo chambers and so undermine the principle that the government stands orfalls in the House of Commons.   In exercising the six main functions listed in paragraph 6 above, the attributes of the reformed second chamber wouldbe those attributed by Bagehot 100 years ago to the monarchy;   the right tobe consulted, the right to encourage, the right to warn.   These rights, ifthey are to be used effectively and to achieve public acceptance, mustbring with them a real, if limited, power of delay whose use should not, asit would with the present composition of the House, risk precipitating a constitutional crisis.   On public legislation generally we believe that are formed second chamber must have a power of delay sufficient to cause the commons and the government to think seriously before proceeding with aproposal against the opposition of the Lords, and that it should provide a real incentive to a government to seek agreement on any point of disputewhich might arise between the House of Commons and the reformed House.   Onthe other hand, we are convinced that it would not be right for a nominatedHouse to be able to frustrate entirely the legislative proposals of agovernment responsible to an elected House.   Even if the House of Lordspressed its objections, we believe that, provided the government had been warned of the objections and had considered its proposals again, the Houseof Commons should be able to carry them into law within a reasonable periodof time.35.   Having agreed on these objectives, we did not find it unduly difficultto achieve a reasonable compromise on this issue, on which agreement had proved impossible in 194-8.   We propose that if the Lords reject a bill itshould be possible to present it for Royal Assent at the end of a period of six months from the point of disagreement between the two Houses, providedthat a resolution directing that it should be presented has been debated and
by the House of Commons.   The period of delay would be capable of running into the next session or the next parliament, and there would be noIieed, as there is under the present procedure, for the disagreed bill topassed again through all its stages in the second session or parliament,jhis period of six months&apos; delay has the double advantage of applying tothe legislation of a government of any party at any stage of a parliament,and of being more readily understandable than the complicated provisions ofthe present Parliament Acts.)i.  On subordinate legislation it seemed clear to us that the Lords&apos; present powers are inappropriate and unsuited to present conditions.   We considereduhether it might be possible to provide for a period of delay analogous tohe period we propose for public legislation, but we came to the conclusionthat such a scheme would be impracticable in present circumstances becauseof the need for some orders to take effect immediately and because the concept of a period of delay is not part of the general legislative frame-mvk within which subordinate legislation is enacted.   We therefore proposethat the present power of outright rejection should be replaced by a powerto insist that the government should think again, and if necessary that theHouse of Commons debate again and vote again upon any instrument to whichthe upper House has taken exception;   but we suggest that the whole subjectof subordinate legislation should be considered by a joint select committeeof both Houses.   Such a committee should also be asked to consider whether an effective control could be devised to ensure that a government couldnot circumvent the delaying powers of the Lords over bills by incorporatingin subordinate legislation matters which should be incorporated in Acts ofParliament, and whether it would be possible to rationalise the division between matters thought suitable for the affirmative and negative procedures.37.  In all our discussions we have all become more and more aware of the positive and constructive role which the House of Lords can play as both adeliberative and a scrutinising chamber in the future.   We hope that theproposed reform of powers and composition will open the way to further-2h-
jevelopments in the functions and procedures of the House, and enable itto play an increasingly valuable part in the work of Parliament as aifhole.   In the second part of this paper our proposals for reform are presented in detail as a comprehensive plan.   We have thought it wise,     5however, to precede the factual description with an account of the reason-ing which led the Conference to reject certain approaches and to acceptothers and so to achieve the consensus on which the proposals are based.In putting them forward we are all of us aware that our parliamentaryorganism is a living thing.   Changes in its structure cannot be justifiedmerely by logical analysis.   Indeed they can do mortal harm unless they take account not only of changing political realities and rapidly develop-ing economic conditions but also of the laws of growth which have determined the evolution of the British constitution over so many generations.
II PROPOSALS FOR REFORM^position38,    We propose that the reformed House should be a two-tier structurecomprising &apos;voting peers with a right both to speak and vote, and &quot;speakingpeers&apos; with a right to speak but not vote.    The voting peers would constitute the &apos;working&apos; House and would consist exclusively of nominatedpeers^    In the first instance, they would include all those existingnominated peers who were willing to accept the obligations which votingnsmbership would carry with it, together with additional life peers createdas necessary to give an appropriate size to the working House and balanoe betweenthe political parties.   Peers by succession include some of the most activemembers of the present House: ^for this reason and to achieve a politicalbalance^ we believe that a number of peers by succession should be created life peers and would thus become qualified for membership of the voting House, butsuccession to a hereditary peerage would no longer, in itself, carry with it theright to exercise a vote.   Voting peers would be expected to give a substantial part of their time to the business of the House and in particular theywould be required to attend a minimum of one-third of the sittings of theHouse or its committees in each session.     They would be required to retire from their voting membership at the end of the parliament in whichthey reached the age of 72 although this requirement would not beintroduced immediately for the reasons given in paragraph 43 below.39.    In addition to the voting members there would, be &apos; speaking&apos;members who would be entitled to speak but not to vote.     The speakingmembers would be those nominated peers who were unable or preferred notto accept the obligations of full working and voting membership but wouldbe able to make a valuable contribution to discussion from time to time,together with those who had passed the age of retirement for votingmembership.    Initially they would also include existing members ofthe House who were peers by succession, other than those who obtainedvoting rights through the grant of a life peerage.    Peers by succession0) l.e. hereditary peers of first creation, life peers created under the life Peerages Aot 1958, law lords and bishops
would   however have the opportunity to withdraw from the House altogetherif they wished to do so - see paragraph 66 below,Ifl,    There would be special arrangements for law lords and bishops, whichtt describe in paragraphs 57-64 below.utaia of membership41,    The present constitutional practice is that new peers are created bythe Queen on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, after consultationlith other party leaders in the case of nominations from their parties.After becoming a peer, whether by succession or on first creation, a peer1 right to sit in the House of Lords is derived from the rights given to(1)his by letters patentN &apos; j     once he possesses these rights he is entitled toa seat in Parliament and to receive a new writ of summons for eachparliament for the remainder of his lifetime.    The writ may not be withheld unless he is disqualified (e.g. as a minor, a bankrupt or an alien).    We propose that these arrangements should in general remain unchanged, except that those peers who succeed to a hereditary peerage afterthe reform comes into effect, or are then minors, would no longer become entitled to sit in the House of Lords or to receive writs of summons solely by virtue of such a peerage.    We have not thought it right to considerthe rights and privileges of the peerage as an order and we believe thesequestions to be outside the scope of a reform which is concerned with theposition of the House of Lords as the second chamber of Parliament.    the reform would not therefore affect the right of a peer by succession to use his title.Voting and speaking rights!f2.   The writ of summons would be the same for all peers who were entitledto sit in the House, whether they possessed the right to vote or only theright to speak.    The distinction between voting and speaking rights wouldderive from legislation which would specify the qualifications and requirements for the voting right and the circumstances in which the right^ght be relinquished or removed.     It would provide that all existing0) other than those whose peerage was initially created by summons toParliament.
nominated peers would be qualified for voting rights when the reform tookjffect and that all future  nominated peers would be so qualified on theircreation.    Not all nominated peers would however wish to exercise these rights or to aooept the obligations which would accompany them,   and itfould not be expected that they should do so.    In order to provide fora choice, a requirement would be introduced that a peer qualified for voting rights should deposit a declaration of his intention to exeroisethem before he would be entitled to vote.    He would be required todeposit this declaration within a specified period of receiving the writ;if he failed or preferred not to do so he would not be entitled to makea declaration or exercise voting rights until the next parliament.\),    The legislation would include a provision preventing a peer from making a voting declaration after he had reached the age of retirement.The age of retirement should not however be introduced immediately, and we propose that there should be no age of retirement in this parliament /orthe next/-   Retirement related to an age of 72 should be introduced inparliaments thereafter.   We think it important that during the early stages of the reform as many as possible of the more active members of the presentHouse should remain available and continue as full working members to givethe benefit of their knowledge and experience in what must inevitably bea period of adjustment.     In the long term, however, we do not think itwould be right for a working legislative chamber to contain an indefinitenumber of members, however distinquished, who are well beyond the normalage cf retirement from active life;   and if members are to be paid (seeparagraph 51 below) we do not think it would be right for membership tocarry with it the right to be paid for the remainder of their lives.The choice of a particular retiring age is necessarily a matter of difficultJudgement and we recognise that sobs peers would be valuable members ofthe House for some years after the proposed age of retirement, but a feature ofthe two-tier scheme which we propose is that they would be able to remain asspsaking peers, and so continue to play an active and constructive part inthe work of the House.   A peer would in any event be able to exercise voting
Rights during the whole of the parliament within which he reached the age of 72&amp;50 that where a parliament lasted its full term of five years, the actual age ofLtir&amp;Bent would be between 72 and 76,IL,   It would be a condition of the right to exercise &amp; vote that a peerfhould attend not less than one-third of the sittings of the House er itsaoumittees in each session (attendance at committees would count for thispurpose as attending the House);    There would however be provision for aloting peer who was absent from the House on account of ill-health orparliamentary or government business to be exempted from this requirement.me exemption would be granted by the House itself in appropriate cases.In order to preserve the freedom of the Prime Minister in appointingMinisters of his choice and to ensure that a Minister in the House of1Lords would be a voting member of that House, Ministers wouldalso be exempted from both the attendance requirement and the agejjjsstriction.    If a voting peer who was not exempted from the attendancerequirement found himself unable to meet it or preferred not to do so, hewould be expected to surrender his voting rights;   if he did not do so1and it were found at the end of a session that he had not during thatsession attended the necessary number of sittings he would, unless exempted, beiteemed to have surrendered them.   A voting peer who had surrendered his voting1lights or was deemed to have done so would not be able to recover themIduring the same parliament,   but he would be able to do so by making aaIfresh declaration of his intention to exercise voting rights at thefsginning of the next parliament.     There would be no restriction on aJpinated peer&apos;s right to make such a declaration at the beginning oflaoh parliament (provided that he had not passed the age of retirement)ind a nominated peer would in this sense continue to possess a voting freehold&apos; which could not be taken from him.    The important principleIi3 which we have referred in paragraph 2 9 above would thus be preserved,jpaer in receipt of a writ of summons who was not entitled to exerciseI&quot; 0) There would be exceptions for serving law lords and certain bishops:I   see paragraphs 57 - 6k below.
SECRETvoting rights would still possess speaking rights and would therefore remain a speaking peer.Size of the voting House15,    The eventual size of the voting House would depend on circumstances and the way in which its functions developed, but our studies suggest thata reasonable size would prove to be between 230 and 280, excluding lawlords and bishops.     The number of peers who attend regularly (i.e. morethan one-third of the sittings) was about 230 in the last complete session,and we propose that a voting House of about that size should be created inthe first instance.46.   A larger number might be found necessary as the work of the Housedevelops and expands in the future, and much would also depend on thenumber of speaking peers who attended debates in the House or served oncommittees, and on the frequency with which they did so.     The size of the voting House might also vary with changes of government or in the relativestrength of the opposition parties.    A scheme which combines a voting&apos;freehold&apos; with the right for the government of the day to have a majorityof the voting party members must necessarily be sensitive to changes ofgovernment and to changes in the relative strength of the political partiesgenerally, since with each change of government a number of new peers wouldbe needed to give the appropriate government majority and the correct partybalance.    In most parliaments the number of new pears entering the votingHouse would be roughly matched by the number leaving the voting Househaving reached the age of retirement, but a succession of changes ofgovernment at short intervals could lead to a temporary increase in the size of the voting House until enough peers had retired from it to restore the situation to equilibrium.     Mathematical models have been constructedto test the possible effect on the size of the reformed House of variouscombinations of circumstances, both as they might appear in the future andas they have actually appeared during the last sixty years.     Studies basedon them have shown that most of the likely combinations of circumstances could be reflected in the composition of the voting House without anunmanageable increase in its size.   We propose in paragraphs 68 and 69-30-
bolow that the Conference might remain in being to consider certain aspects of the working of the House after reform:   its size is one aspectto which the Conference might pay particular attention.Relationship between the parties47.    We propose that the government of the day should normally have amajority in the House of Lords of about 10 per cent of the combined strengthof the opposition parties.   The distribution of seats between the opposition parties would so far as possible be determined in relation to theirrepresentation in the House of Commons and to the number of votes cast for themin recent general elections, but it would not be related exactly to eithersince neither is an accurate reflection of a party  s strength.    Wetherefore propose that in advising the Queen on the creation of new peersthe Prims Minister of the day should seek a distribution between the minority parties which would so far as possible reflect their relativestrength ^in the countrv7*   Assuming a total voting House of 230, thefigures which we oonsider would be appropriate in the present parliamentare:   government 105, main opposition party 80,   subsidiary opposition parties 15 and cross benchers 30 (these figures again exclude law lords and bishops).   ^If the total membership were more than 230 the partyrepresentation would be increased in proportion^   The figure for particular parties would naturally be capable of being varied from timeto time to reflect changes in their relative strength and to take account of the emergence of any new parties, and this is a second aspectwhich the Conference might keep tinder review after the reform has comeinto effect.Speaking peers48,    Speaking peers would comprise:(a) nominated peers who preferred not to exercise voting rights(including any who were deemed to have surrendered them);(b) nominated peers who had passed the age of retirement for votingrights;   and(0) existing members of the House who were peers by succession (otherthan those who became voting peers through the grant of a lifepeerage ).
-32-SEC RETpor the reasons we have given in paragraph 32 above, speaking peers wouldbe an integral and important part of the reformed House /and thoir presencewould add to its distinction, authority and independence/7.   /To ensurethat they would be able to play their full part,J7 we propose that on the floor of the House a speaking peer should have the same rights as a votingpeer, with the exception of the right to vote.    He would therefore be ableto ask questions or move motions (including motions relating to billsand amendments to them).    We also propose that lie should be able to serve on committees, subject to the restriction that he would not be able to vote on any question relating to legislation.    Voting peers would thuscontrol the legislative work and have the final power of decision but therewould at the same time be every opportunity for speaking peers to influence the decisions by their contribution to debate, both on the floor of the House and in committee.Scotland. Wales and Northern Ireland49.   We attach; the greatest importance to the presence in the reformed house of peers who can speak with authority on the problems and wishes ofScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and of the regions of England, andwe have considered very carefully how their presence might most effectivelybe secured.    We /understand&quot; that the Prime Minister already consults widelybefore recommending new peerages and we7 note that there is at present in theHouse of Lords a considerable number of peers who can speak with authority on the needs of the different parts of the United Kingdom.    We therefore consider that the most satisfactory method of securing the presence of suchpeers in the future would be for the Prims Minister of the day, in advising the Queen on the creation of new peers, to pay special and continuousregard to the need for the membership of the House of Lords to include asuitable number of persons with knowledge of, and experience in, matters which are of special concern to the various parts and regions of theUnited Kingdom.    / Such a requirement might be made statutory^?   This18 a third aspect of the working of the reformed House which we believej the Conference should keep under review.
jO,   There are strong constitutional arguments, based on the presence of scottish peers in the House of Lords ever since 1707, and praotioalgrguments arising from the existenoe of separate Scottish legislation,which make it particularly important that the reformed House should include a suitable number of Scottish peers.Bflimmeration51,   Peers are at present able to claim up to ki guineas a day inreimbursement of expenses necessarily incurred in attending the House,and those who live away from London can recover their travelling expensesprovided that they have attended not less than one-third of the sittings of the House in the month for which the claim is made.^      Bothallowances are free of tax.    We recommend that voting peers should infuture be paid at a taxable rate which would reflect the responsibilities and duties which they would be expected to undertake;   we do not howeverpropose any particular rate, since we believe that the whole question of remuneration would be better considered by an independent body   similar tothe Committee on the Remuneration of Ministers and Members of Parliament(the Lawrence Committee) which reported in 1964 (Cmnd 2516), or by thePrices and Incomes Board.Powers &quot; Public bills52.   As regards the powers of the reformed House, we propose that itshould be provided that a public bill originating in the House of Commons(other than a bill to prolong the life of a parliament) on which thereis disagreement between the two Houses may be presented for Royal Assentat the end of a period of six calendar months from the date of disagreementprovided that a resolution directing that it should be presented had beenAbated and passed in the House of Commons.     For this purpose, disagreementwould be defined as a situation where a motion for the seoond or thirdwading of a bill sent up from the Commons is rejected or postponed by thetords, or where an amendment  insisted on by the Lords is unacceptable to the^ Scottish peers are required to attend only one-third of the sittingsat which Scottish business has been discussed
Commons.    The House of Lords would be deemed to have a period of two(1)parliamentary monthsv &apos; in which to consider a bill   if its consideration of a bill on which there was subsequent disagreementexceeded this period, the excess would count as part of the six months&apos;period of delay following disagreement.    A bill would be capable ofbeing presented for Royal Assent at the end of the period of delay,notwithstanding that this ran over a prorogation of Parliament and intoa new sessiohj   similarly, in the case of a dissolution, any bill whichhad been passed by the House of Commons and to which the Lords had disagreed&apos; could be presented for Royal Assent in the new parliament after the six months&apos;period of delay had elapsed from the date of disagreement.    provision would also be made to allow any modifications which had been agreed betweenthe two Houses before the end of the period of delay to be incorporated inthe bill before it became law.    The procedure for this purpose would not provide for the discussion of the bill as a whole to be reopened and theHouse of Commons would not be obliged to take any action on any proposalsfor oompromisej   but there would be provision in the legislation for theresolution of the House of Commons directing that a bill rejected by the lords should be submitted for Royal Assent to include a direction for making in the bill as so submitted such amendments as were certified bythe Speaker to give effect to the proposals for modifications agreed toby both Houses since the date of the rejection.     The legislation wouldalso include a requirement that the bill should be submitted for royal assent within one parliamentary month^ ^ from the end of the period of delayafter disagreement, or would otherwise lapse.53,   Since there is no question of a conflict between a government andthe Lords on private bills and bills to confirm provisional orders, and since the procedures of a quasi-judicial nature on such bills would makeit inappropriate to apply the Parliament Act procedure to them, we do not0) i.e, excluding any period of more than four days for which either house is adjourned.
3EGHEYpropos8 that the present powers of the House of Lords on privatelegislation should be changed.We recommend that the existing provision in the Parliament Actswhich excludes from their application any bill to extend the duration ofa parliament should be continued in relation to the new powers of theHouse of Lords.     It would therefore remain impossible for a bill toextend the duration of a parliament to be passed without the Lords&apos;consent.Pnwers - Subordinate legislation55,   The main types of parliamentary control over subordinate legislation are described in paragraph 26 above.     The procedure inrespect of subordinate legislation which can be annulled by either house is governed by section 5 of the Statutory Instruments Act 1946,under which a resolution for annulment may be passed by either Housewithin 40 days (excluding days on which the House ^either House/ isadjourned) from the day on which it is laid before that House,    Forthese cases we propose that the operation of any resolution forannulment passed by the House of Lords should be suspended until theend of the period of 40 days, or until the end of a period of 20 days from the date on which the resolution is passed, whichever is the later;and that a resolution passed by the Lords should be ineffective if thereaftera corresponding resolution is rejected by the Commons or the instrument inquestion is approved by a resolution of the Commons overriding a resolution of the Lords.    As regards cases in which the affirmative approval ofboth Houses is required, we propose that where a motion for such approvalis rejected by the Lords the House of Commons should be enabled to override the decision of the House of Lords by an express direction.To ensure however that the object of requiring the House of Commons toconsider a proposal a second time is achieved, this power would be limitedto those cases in which the instrument in question had been considered
by the Commons and had been approved by them before the motion forapproval was rejected by the Lords.56,    We have considered whether it would be possible to give theHouse of Lords the right to impose a period of delay in respect of subordinate legislation, especially where it was not urgent, analogous to the proposed right in respect of public bills.     The concept of a periodof delay is not however part of the present power of the House of Lords inrelation to statutory instruments, and a considerable survey would be needed in order to establish the feasibility, in legislative and administrativeterms, of introducing for subordinate legislation any provision for aperiod of delay as such.    It might be possible for such a survey toascertain whether any classification of statutory orders into urgent and less urgent could be devised.     There is a rudimentary distinction in thatsome instruments come into operation at once and the parliamentary procedure, whether affirmative or negative, is addressed to the questionwhether they shall continue in operation;   while other orders require a parliamentary procedure, affirmative or negative, within a specified period before they come into operation.    We cannot always assume however that orders made under the former procedure are urgent and those under thelatter procedure less urgent.     Statutory orders are made under a wide variety of legislative provisions and it would be a mistake to suppose that thereis anything like consistency.    We therefore conclude that no such powerof delay would be practicable at this stage, but we believe that a joint select committee might usefully be set up to consider the subject of subordinate legislation generally, and we develop this idea more fully in paragraphs 6 - 8 of the Appendix.Law lords57.    The term &apos;law lord&apos; is colloquial;   we use it to cover all those members of the House of Lords who are entitled to form a judicial.36-SEGHEY
quorum under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876.    They include:(a) the Lord Chancellor and serving Lords of Appealin Ordinary (the latter hold life peerages createdunder the Appellate Jurisdiction Acts   1876 - 1947jthey are at present nine in number but the statutorymaximum has been increased to eleven under theAdministration of Justice Act 1968)1(b) former Lord Chancellors and retired Lords of Appealin Ordinary (at present there are two of the formerand eight of the latter);   and(c) other peers who hold or have held high judicial office:for example, the Lord Chief Justice or the Master ofthe Rolls (at present there are three such peers).As members of the House of Lords the law lords at present exercise twofunctions:   a judicial function which arises from the position of theHouse as the supreme appellate court of the United Kingdom;   and a more general function as ordinary but specialist members of the House as thesecond chamber of Parliament,58,   &quot;We have not thought it right to examine the judicial functions ofthe House of Lords in the context of the reform, and we do not therefore propose any change in the responsibilities or rights of law lords inrelation to the judicial business of the House.   In particular, all lawlords would continue to be able to vote on the judicial business of theHouse, regardless of the attendance qualification or any restriction onage.59.    As regards their more general function, the responsibilities and rightsof law lords are not at present in any way different in law from those ofother peers but a convention has been developed under which law lords do not participate in party political controversy:   they may speak on controversial
nutters but do so in a specialist capacity as awn learned in the law.As skilled and experienced lawyers however they have a valuable part toplay in tha consideration of public bills and the legal aspects oflegislation generally.    In addition, four law lords must, under standing order, be included in any meeting of the lords  Committee for Privilegeswhen considering a peerage case, a law lord is usually the chairman ofthe Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills, and law lords sit regularlyon the sessional and House committees and aot in effect as their legal advisers.    We believe that the knowledge and experience of the law lords should continue to bo fully available to the reformed House for its non-judicial business but recognise that some of them - those whose work may take place outside the House, for example in the Judicial Commmittee of the privy Council - might not be able to meet the attendance requirement whichwould be a oondition for the exercise of voting rights.    We believe thatit would be appropriate for all serving law lords - i.e. the LordChancellor, serving Lords of Appeal in Ordinary and other peers, such asthe Lord Chief Justioe and the Master of the Rolls, who hold high judicialoffice - to possess voting rights;   but since in their speoial circumstancesany distinction between those who oould meet the attendance requirement andthose who could not would be entirely arbitrary, we consider that the rightsolution would be to confer the right to vote on all of them by virtue oftheir office, irrespective of their attendance.    Other law lords, i.e.those who have retired from those offices, would be subjeot to the ordinaryrules and qualify for voting rights on non-judicial business only if theymet the attendance requirement and had not passed the age of retirement.Bishops60,    There are at present 26 bishops of the Church of England who haveseats in the House of Lords.     They are the Archbishops of Canterbury andYork and the Bishops of London, Durham and Winchester who sit ex officio,and 21 other bishops by seniority of appointment to diocesan sees.    All hold their seats during their tenure of their sees.
ft    There are arguments both for excluding bishops from the reformed house and for their retention.    For excluding them it might be argued that it is anomalous for bishops of the Church of England to have anyspecial place in a reformed House of Lords which as part of a modern Parliamentmust be essentially a secular institution.     On the other hand, the Houseconsists historically of lords spiritual and temporal, and the Church ofEngland as the established church in England has a special relationship,some aspects of which are delicately balanced, with the State and with theCrown.    The presence of bishops in the House of Lords is an integral partof it.    The Church is in the unique position that its dignitaries are appointed by the Crown on the advice of the Prime Minister;   permanent changesin its liturgy require the approval of Parliament;   its courts areconstituted by statute and the duties of the clergy towards the communityare founded on common or statute lawj   its legislative powers under theEnabling Act of 1919 are based on a particular relation with Parliament;and the Queen is its * Supreme Governor&apos; and necessarily a member of it.It is within this whole pattern of Church and State relationship that the26 bishops have seats in the House of Lords.     The relationship is at present under investigation by the Commission on Church and State, set up by thetwo archbishops at the request of the Church Assembly in ^^66 and which hasnot yet reported.    No other church is subject to parliamentary control ofthis kind.62.   We recognise that a decision to exclude bishops from the reformed Houseof Lords, or fundamentally to alter their position in it, would affect theChurch&apos;s relationship with the State and prejudice the discussions which aretaking place in the Archbishops5 Commission.    We believe that the Church should first reach its own conclusions on this subject and that decisions made inthe context of the reform of the House of Lords should not anticipate any fresh consideration of the whole issue of the Church and State relation.Some adjustment in the position of bishops is necessary in the context ofa two-tier House and smaller numbers generally, but pending the settlement-39-SEGHET
of wider questions of Church and State, we consider that the adjustmentsjhould be the minimum necessary to preserve the relative position of the bishops so far as possible unchanged.fa   We therefore propose that, at least for the present, there shouldcontinue to be a place for bishops both as speakers and as voters in the reformed House, but since the House will be reduced in size their totalnumber should be gradually reduced from 26 to 16.    No bishop who is now anumber of the House would be excluded, but as bishops retired from their89es, and therefore from the House, those other than the two archbishopsand the Bishops of London, Durham and Winchester would be replaced on thebasis of one new bishop for every two retirements until 16 remained.     Thetwo archbishops and these three bishops would be replaced by their successorsas at present;   otherwise new bishops would succeed in order of seniority,again as at present, but any who preferred not to become members of theHouse would not be obliged to do so and membership would then devolve uponthe next most senior bishop who was willing to become a member.     Bishopsother than the two archbishops and the Bishops of London, Durham andWinchester would also be allowed to retire from the House before retiringfrom their sees if they wished to do so.     In this way a degree of flexibility would be introduced which could assist the Church to have as its members in the House of Lords those bishops who would be its most effectiverepresentatives - a consideration which will become more important as their total number is reduced.The arguments for retaining bishops as members of the reformed Housepending the conclusion of the Commission on Church and State are alsoarguments for allowing some of them to retain voting rights, even though their diocesan duties might make it impossible for them to meet the attendance requirement.    We therefore propose that the two archbishopswd the Bishops of London, Durham and Winchester who are at present *ex officiomembers of the House should continue as &apos;ex officio * voting members, exemptfroa the attendance requirement.
Bights of Peers to vote in parliamentary eleotionaTraditionally, peers have been disqualified from voting in parliamentary elections on the ground that the peerage is a separate Estateof the Realm, distinct from the Commons Estate, and a member of the firsthas no right to influence the composition of the second.    This has beenthe situation whether or not the peer was himself entitled to a seat inthe House of Lords:   for example, Scottish peers other than thoseelected as representative peers were unable either to sit in the House ofLords or to vote in parliamentary elections before the Peerage Aot 196?.This doctrine evolved at a time when the right to vote in parliamentary elections was very restricted, and the changes which were made in 1963have meant that all peers and peeresses are now allowed either to sit inthe House of Lords or, if not, to vote in parliamentary elections (providedthat they are qualified as regards age and residence).    We do not believe thatin th8 context of the reformed House, it would any longer he appropriate tomaintain a peer&apos;s disqualification from voting in parliamentary elections,shether or not he is entitled to sit in the House of Lords.    Such adisqualification is an anachronism in a modern democracy where the right totake part in the process of ohoosing the members of the eleeted chambershould be fundamental and universal, and it does not apply to members of second chambers in other democratic oountries such as Australia, canada and the United States of America.    We therefore believe that all peers,whether or not they are members of the reformed House, should in future be qualified to vote in parliamentary eleotions.Rights of peers to sit in the House of Commons or to surrendertheir membership of the House of Lords66.   A peer is also disqualified from sitting in the House of Commons unless he has renounced his title under the Peerage Act 1963.    It would dearlybe absurd for any person to be entitled to a seat in both Hpuses ofParliament, and we therefore believe that this disqualification should
be continued for peers who are memebers of the reformed House.    Sincethe possession of a hereditary peerage will not in the future give any rightto membership of the reformed House, however, we propose that all futurepeers by succession should have the right to sit in the House of Commonsif elected, and that they should no longer be required to surrender theirtitles in order to do so.    We do not propose, however, that the provision in the Act of 19^3 which would allow them to renounce their titles shouldbe repealed, since some might wish to renounce their titles for reasonsunconnected with membership of the House of Commons.    It would be consistent with this proposal to include also a transitional provisionfor those existing peers by succession who do not receive life peeragesrhen the reform comes into effect and this we also propose:   they would thus be given a further once-for-all option to renounce the membership of the House of Lords to which they would otherwise be entitled, andso to gain the right to sit in the House of Commons if elected.     Theywould be required to exercise this option within a period of one year;but like future peers by succession they would not be required to surrender their titles.    There would, however, be no provision foraoiainated peers to surrender either their membership of the House or theirtitles.    ^The nine peers who have renounoed their titles under thePeerage Act 1963 could be given the right to recover them if they wish,although not to resume their seats in the House of Lords./Funotions and procedure of the reformed House67.   Throughout our discussions we have looked forward to a review ofthe funotions and procedures of the two Houses which would take place once the main reform had come into effeot.    This review would be an importantcontinuation of the prooess of improving the efficiency of Parliament, but since it would more properly be carried out by the two Houses, we have not thought it appropriate for us to make any specific proposals ourselves.-k3-
Ifa have however set out in the Appendix some possible developments whichnight be examined by a joint select committee in due course after the reform had come into effeot.pnridnf; of the House of Lords after reformWe recognise that certain aspects in particular will need to be kept under periodical review, and some of them we have already mentioned above.They include the size and the party balance of the voting House,particularly in relation to any new parties which may emerge, or to changesin the relative strength of the existing parties, and also to take accountof coalitions or divisions within parties.    Another vitally importantaspect will be the need to secure amongst the members of the House as awhole a suitable range of knowledge and experience, including knowledge and experience of those matters which are of special concern to the various parts and regions of the United Kingdom.    We believe that the conference could usefully remain in being to consider these subjects when necessary and that a working sub-committee might also remain in being for thispurpose.    The Conference or a sub-committee might also have a valuablerole in preliminary thinking on the development of procedure and functions in the reformed House, especially where they might impinge on the workof and procedural developments in the House of Commons (see paragraph 67above)*    A joint body such as the Conference would be particularly useful for this purpose.    In considering these subjects the Conference would not however derogate from the responsibilities which the two Houses exercisethrough existing machinery.69,   Another aspect of this reformed House which would need to be kept under review is the composition of the cross benches.    As we have said inparagraph 24 above, they do not act at present in any way as an organisedgroup or with any sense of corporate identity, and their voting andspeaking record in recent years shows that most of them do indeed vote asgenuine independents, without regular support for any one party.    we expect them to oontinue to act in this way in the future and not to become a new oonstitutional force, but it would nevertheless be important to
! U Uensure that no undue party bias developed among them.    Since theiresenoe is in our view vital to safeguard the independence of the House,; n would also be important to ensure that their numbers were adequatelyaaintained.    We suggest that the Conference might therefore be chargedsith the responsibility of advising the Prime Minister of the day onthis aspect of the reformed House;   we do not propose that it should offernames or comment on them before new peerages are announced, but we believethat it could perform an important and valuable function in drawing attentionto any imbalance or deficiencies which might emerge over a period of time.A further advantage is that it would help the Prime Minister of the day to answer any criticism which might be made of his use of his patronage.70.    We consider that some cross bench peers should also be included amongstthose peers by succession who are created life peers when the reform comes into effect (see paragraph 358 above).    They would be nominated by the PrimeSinister, after appropriate consultations.Date of commencement of the reform71,   We are unanimous in our agreement to the foregoing proposals, but wehave not been able to agree to a date on which they should come into effect.72.   The representatives of the Conservative party believe that it would beimproper and without precedent to reform the composition of the House in away which would diminish the rights of any of its members, except at the beginningof a new parliament.     They consider that to do so would be contrary to theletter and spirit of the writ of summons which all the present members of theHouse of Lords have received, and which implies that they would be entitledand indeed expected to sit and vote in the House for the full duration ofthe parliament.    Further, they consider that it would be wrong to base the composition of the reformed House on the present representation of thepolitical parties in the House of Commons since that reflects the politicalsituation at the time of the general election in 1966.-hk-
ij,   The representatives of the Government and of the Liberal party point0ut that previous reforms of the composition of the House of Lords havegenerally added to its membership, leaving intact the rights of existing members, and that on the rare occasions when members have lost their rightto sit the measures concerned have taken effect during the course of a parliament.    They do not attach importance to to the terms of the writ ofjummons which is not regarded as having any constitutional significance:   manypeers have in faot for many years disregarded its terms, and the existing arrangements for leave of absence in effect overrule it.     In any event no existing member would lose his right to sit in the House(although some would lose their right to vote);   and sinoe the remainingdetails of the reform are agreed between the parties and should therefore not, in the Government&apos; s opinion, become an election issue, it would be ofno constitutional significance whether the reform came into effect during the parliament or at the beginning of a new parliament.74,   They believe, however, that there are strong practical arguments for introducing the reform as soon as possible *    It is fundamental to theproposals that the reform should be evolutionary in its approach, with noabrupt break with previous practices, and it would be an important part ofthis approach for the reform to come into effect during a parliament so thatthe working conventions which have been established between the parties couldbe adapted and applied to the new situation without the need for the partiesto adapt themselves simultaneously to a new parliament (which might include a change of government) and the new circumstances of a reformed House.Further, the House of Lords would itself be in a very difficult situationin any period between the parties&apos; agreement to the scheme of the reform and its introduction, and the development and closer integration of thefunctions and powers of the two Houses which all members of the Conferencehope will follow the reform would be unnecessarily delayed and the presentmomentum would be lost.
iM^BS^S- ......        17Q%t   Our proposals can be summarised as follows:(a) The reformed House of Lords should be a two-tier structure comprisingvoting peers, with a right to speak and vote, and speaking peers, witharight to speak but not vote (paragraph 38)9(b) Voting peers would be exclusively nominated peers, but some peersby succession would be created life peers and therefore become qualified tobe voting peers (paragraph 38),(0)  Speaking peers would include nominated peers who did not meet therequirements of voting membership, and peers who at the time of the reformsat by right of succession (paragraph 39).(&amp;)  After the reform came into effect, succession to a hereditary peerageshould no longer carry the right to a seat in the House of Lords   (paragraph 41).(e) Voting peers would be expected to play a full part in the work of the house and required to attend at least one-third of the sittings; they would be subjectto an age of retirement (paragraphs k3-kk).(f) The voting House would initially consist of about 230 peers,distributed between the parties in a way which would give the government small majority over the opposition parties, but not a majority of theHouse as a whole including cross benchers (paragraphs 45-47).(g) Speaking peers would be able to ask questions and move motions andalso to serve in committee5   they would be an integral and important partof the reformed House (paragraph 48).(h) The reformed House should include a suitable number of peers able to speak with authority on the problems and wishes of Scotland, Wales,Northern Ireland and the regions of England (paragraphs 49-50).(i) Voting peers should be paid at a rate which would reflect their responsibilities and duties (paragraph 51).(j)  The reformed House should be able to impose a delay of six months onthe passage of an ordinary public bill en which there was disagreement between the two Houses;     it should then be possible to submit the bill for
joyal Assent provided that a resolution of that effect had been debated ,andised in the House of Commons,    The period of delay should be capable of joining into a new session or into a new parliament (paragraphs 52-54).(lc) The reformed House should be able to require the House of commons to reconsider an item of subordinate legislation to which the House of Lordsdisagreed, but its disagreement should no longer be final (paragraphs 55-56).(l) There should be a place in the reformed House for law lords andbishops (paragraphs 57-64).(n) All peers should in future be qualified to vote in parliamentary elections (paragraph 65).(n) Future peers by succession should be enabled to sit in the Houseof Commons if elected (paragraph 66).(0) Existing peers by succession should have an option to renounce theiraenbership of the House of Lords if they wish to do so, and thereby been abled to sit in the House of Commons if elected (paragraph 66).(p) A review should be made of the functions and procedures of the two houses once the main reform has come into effect (paragraph 67 and theAppendix).(q) The Conference should remain in being to consider various aspects ofthe working of the House of Lords after reform (paragraphs 68-69)./J6.

APPENDIXPOSSIBLE CHANGES IN FUNCTIONS AND PROCEDUBBf,   Refers of the powers and composition of the House of Lords would open the way for a fresh look at the functions of the two Houses ofParliament.   It would be right for this to be undertaken, in the firstinstances by a joint select committee of the two Houses.   The following are possible changes in functions and procedure which might be considered further in that context.Public bills:   general.   A substantial contribution towards improving the legislative processoould be obtained through a more even spread of the introduction of publicbills over the session.  More bills should, therefore, be introduced inthe House of Lords.   In particular, bills should not be prevented fromstarting in the House of Lords because they are in some degree politicallycontroversial or because they incorporate financial provisions.   This isthe subject of a recommendation of the Sixth Report from theCoseos3c Select Committee on Procedure (H.C. 1966-67, 539, paragraphs and 8). The Commons&apos; financial privilege would have to be waived,preferably by standing order (on the model of the Commons * standing order No. 57), or alternatively by legislation in the context of are formed House.3.   Obvious advantages would follow from a better flow of bills fromone House to the other.  There is, however, the difficulty that billsintroduced into the House of Lords would tend to reach the House ofCoaiaons in the late spring and summer when the Commons are pre-oocupiedwith financial business.   It might be necessary, in order to obtain full advantage from an improved flow of legislation from one House to the other,to increase the number of Cabinet and other  Ministers in the House of Lords&amp;t present there are in the House only two Cabinet Ministers and only
thirteen other Ministers, of idiom one is permanently at the United Nationstwo ethers are not often able to attend the Rouse because of otheroofflfflitiaentsaPijbllo bills:   Committee proceduret.   If the Lords are to play a more productive part in legislation, itmight be desirable to adopt some form of public bill committee procedure.It need not be modelled on the Commons&apos; standing committees.It would be premature at this stage to make suggestions as to its precise form and function;   the question should be referred to a select committeeof the reformed House of Lords which would be asked to recommend to theHouse the type of public bill committee which it considered would be most useful.  The same select committee might also consider other aspects ofpublic bill procedure in the House of Lords:   for example, whether or not it is desirable to follow the example of the House of Commons in the useof second reading committees.Public bills:   Accelerated procedure5.   There are two possible ways of accelerating the legislative processfor bills of a kind which do not need consideration at as many stagesas the present procedures require:   the proceedings in one of the Houseseould be curtailed, or some of the stages of consideration could be madea joint procedure.   Of these two possibilities, the latter seems the more promising.   It might, for example, become an established convention thatcertain classes of bill should start in the House of Lords and thenreoeive detailed examination by a joint committee of the two Houses.Experience on consolidation bills shows that under such an arrangementthe main burden would fall on the Lords and very little of the Commons&apos;time would be needed when a bill reached  the lower House.   Classes of billsuitable for this treatment might include bills resulting from the workof the Law Commissions, and other technical but uncontroversial bills.   A
if   further possibility would be to commit to a joint committee privateI   menders&apos; bills on oontroversial aooial subjeots after they had received a1   second reading in either House,subordinate legislation,   Present procedures in relation to subordinate legislation may be thought to occupy time on the floor of both Houses unnecessarily, to the extent thatprayers are moved as a device for obtaining explanations or assuranceswithout being pressed to a division^ and to the extent that affirmative resolutions lead to debate on orders which are not matters vE controversy *Moreover, the work of the Lords9 Special Orders Committee duplicates tosome extent that of the Commons&apos; Statutory Instruments Committee.  the commons&apos; Select Committee on Procedure recommends in its SixthReport (H.C. 1966-67, 539) that it should be made possible to refer non-:  contentious affirmative resolutions and prayers to the Select Committeeon Statutory Instruments, subject to the same safeguards as exist for!  references to a second reading committee.   Given a reformed House of Lords,there would be so ope for the development, under procedural resolutions, ofa joint procedure on these lines.   A joint committee might be set up toI exercise the combined scrutinising funotions of the Special Ordersn1 committee and the Statutory Instruments Committee, but with a smallerH combined membership.   All statutory instruments could then be referred toft this committee for scrutiny, with the exception of financial orders, whiohI would be considered only by the commons representatives and would be1m reported only to the lower House; but otherwise the committee would report1I to both Houses.   Additionally ? it should be possible for the jointI  committee to consider the merits of affirmative resolutions and prayers.ml  Since it might be thought necessary to permit prayers against negative1orders whioh were expected to be pressed to a division, and affirmativeI^solutions on contentious orders, to be debated on the floor of the House3^ since suoh debate would duplicate discussion in committee, one-50-S EC RET
procedure might be for the government to refer to the joint committee only those prayers which are not expected to be pressed to a division andaffirmative resolutions on nos^oontentious orders.   Motions to referresolutions and prayers to the committee would be subject to the samesafeguards as exist for reference of bills to a second reading committee.As regards proceedings in the committee on prayers or affirmative resolutions, it could be provided that Ministers and members of the Housewho were not members of the committee could speak but not vote, and couldexamine witnesses.   Alternatively, as recommended by the Commons&apos;Select Committee oa Procedure, the joint eommittee could have a specifiednumber of members added by ifee Committee of Selection and would conductits debates in the manner of a standing committee.   The joint committeewould report to both Houses whether it recommended that an instrument be approved.   It is for consideration whether this recommendation would be put to the House for approval without amendment or debate (as recommended bythe Select Committee) or whether it should be open to debate where a givennumber of members so desired, despite the opportunity for objection on theoriginal motion to refer the matter to the joint committee.7.    In the longer termg the development of an effective joint procedure forscrutinising statutory ias-te-asBsnts might enable provision to be made forthe amendment of statutory instruments (since a means would be available of reconciling differences between the two Houses), and even for abolishing the affirmative resolution procedure at least in its present form.   Butchanges of this magnitude oould be considered by the joint select eommitteewhen the new House of Lords was constituted.8.    If these broad proposals were adopted, a number of issues would remain to be considered in more detail by the proposed joint committee on procedure;   for example, the method of reference of matters for debate(e,g. an alternative procedure of automatic reference of all instruments,leaving the committee discretion to select topios for debate) and the-51-SECRET
! i 0proceedings in the two Houses on the report of the joint committee.9.   A general reform of the fusetions and prooedures of the House ofLords j with an emphasis on joint committees, would provide a suitableo-oeasioB for reopening the question of extending the use of joint committees for the consideration of private billsa    This question was exhaustivelydiscussed by the Joint Committee on Private Bill Procedure in 1955 (see paragraphs 53-65 of its Report - HL 14*58 - I, HC 139 - I).   On balance,that committee came to the conclusion that it could not recommend any alteration in the present system.   It did however report that the argument in favour of a second hearing depends largely on the fact that, until thecase for the promoters is deployed and the attitude of the government isknown, petitioners are placed at an unfair disadvantage.   If a means couldbe found for an earlier deployment of the case for the promoters and theattitude of the government, petitioners would not be at such a disadvantageas they now are and joint committees might therefore be more freely used.However, such an important ehange could hardly be made without wideconsultation among interested parties and a recommendation from a furtherjoint committee on private bill procedure which might also consider businessof a private character such as special procedure orders.Specialist committees10. There is soope for involving the Lords in specialist committees.   the lords could set up their own specialist committees (e.g. on the arts, oraspects of law reform) in which the Commons might participate;   andTioe versa.   It is suggested in paragraph 11 (a) below that provision shouldbe made for unequal membership.   There are clearly some committees of theHouse of Commons in which the Lords should not participate (e.g. the public accounts and Estimates Committees) and others on which the House of Lordsmight be only sparsely represented (eeg. the Nationalised industries committee).   Other committees might draw their membership equally from both
Houses (e.g. ad hoc pre-legislation committees and committeesspecialising in the affairs of public departments)!   and yet ethers(for example on aspects of law reform) might he entirely composed ofLords or contain only a small representation from the House of Commons.iAny such representation of the members of one House in a committee ofthe other would be subject to procedural decisions to be taken in theproposed joint committee on procedure*Other matters11,  Other matters which might be pursued by the proposed jointcommittee on procedure ares(a) Enabling joint select committees to consist of unequalmembership.   At present the representation of each House ina joint committee must be equal (though there has been asingle exception to this rule).   With such flexibility it wouldbe possible to ensure suitable representation of each House onthe committees of either House.(b) Enabling joint select committees to appoint subcommittees and.where desirable, to proceed by way of public debate.   Thiswould, for example, give scope for a joint committee to dealexpeditiously with manor aspects of subordinate legislation.(o)  The right of a member of either House to attend and speak, butnot to vote, in a joint committee, though not a member of that committee.   This would be an extension of the Lords&apos; standing order No. 58 and could be convenient in a joint committee, forexample on subordinate legislation.
