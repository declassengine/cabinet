gDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT)C(68) 69COPY NO.25th July, 1968CABINETLOCATION OF THE INLAND REVENUE SCHEDULE E COMPUTERCENTRE FOR SOUTHERN ENGLANDEnvironmental Planning discussed the location of Inland RevenueSchedule E computer centres.     They agreed, subject to confirmation of my concurrence, that the computer centre for Southern England shouldbe located at Plymouth.    I am afraid that I cannot concur, and must urge the Cabinet to reconsider this decision02.       The location approved for this centre by the majority of theOfficial Committee on Dispersal was the Southampton/Portsmouthareas    In my view the case for preferring this area is conclusive,,This is not so much a matter of the additional cost of going to Plymouth,though that would amount to about  1 million.    More serious is that adecision in favour of Plymouth would impose a delay of at least five or six years on the completion of the centralisation programme,,    A centrecould be set up in the Southampton/Portsmouth area in the period 1977-79;it would not be possible to set up a centre in Plymouth until the period1932-84, and then only if a considerable number oi staff could beprevailed upon to accept transfers to the South-Y/est03.       The delay in the completion of the programme would be seriousbecause, until it is completed, the Inland Revenue have to operate boththe new automated system and the present manual system.     This iscostly and inefficient;  it impairs the service given to taxpayers andimpairs the ability of the Inland Revenue to undertake major changes of the tax system,4,       The reason why the Revenue could build up so much more quicklyin Southampton/Portsmouth than in Plymouth is that there are 12 existingtax districts in the Southampton/Portsmouth area, including a large office which handles PAYS dispersed from London- whereas there are only three existing tax districts within travelling distance of Plymouth,    Itwould be more difficult to persuade staff to accept transfer from Londonand the South-East to Plymouth than to Southampton/Portsmouth.      I also fear that there would also be some difficulty in persuading the staff to accept the programme as a whole, if the only alternative to resignationfor all the surplus staff in the London area and the Eastern, Southern andSouth-Eastern counties of England was a transfer to Scotland, the north of England or Plymouth.    If we insisted on Plymouth, we might forfeitthe agreement of the staff to some of the other proposed locations.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer at their meeting on 2 5th June the Minister!al Committee onCO NFIDENTSAL
5.       In planning the location of these centres we have had the fullestregard to the need to decentralise and to considerations cf regional policy.    There will be centres in East Kilbride, Bootle, Manchester,Cardiff, Tyneside and the Leeds/Bradford area.    We have agreed thatthe centre for Outer London shall be at Edinburgh;  and we have agreedthat the possibility of locating the Midland centre on Teesside or in SouthWales should be further examined.    All this being so, I do not think thatwe need regard regional considerations as requiring us to insist onPlymouth rather than Southampton/Portsmouth as the location for thecentre for Southern England, at the price of 5.1 million and five or six years&apos; delay in the programme.6.       In the light of all these considerations I invite the Cabinet to agreewith the majority of the Official Committee on Dispersal that the InlandRevenue Computer Centre for Southern England should be located in theSouthampton/Pertsrnouth area.Treasury Chambers, S-W.l418th July, 19&amp;G
