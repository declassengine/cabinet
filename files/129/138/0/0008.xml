oNFAitPART I180CHAPTER IThe Right Hon. James Callaghan, M.P.,Secretary of State for the Home Departmentof State for Education and science the Right Hon. Anthony Greenwood, M.P.,Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentThe Right Hon. Kenneth Robinson, M.minister of Health1.    We were appointed on 20th December 19^5&quot;to review the organisation and responsibilities of the local authoritypersonal social services in England and Wales, and to consider what changes are desirable to secure an effective family service&quot;.2.    We now have the honour to submit our Report.     We recommend a new localauthority department, providing a community based and family oriented service,which will be available to all.     This new department will, we believe, reachfar beyond the discovery and rescue of social casualties;   it will enable thegreatest possible number of individuals to aot reciprocally, giving and receiving service for the well-being of the wholo community.3.    The new department will have responsibilities going beyond those of existinglocal authority departments, but they will include the present services providedby children&apos;s departments, the welfare services provided under the national assistance Act 1948, educational   welfare and child guidance services, tho homehelp servico, mental health social work services, other social work services provided by health departments, day nurseries, and certain social welfare workcurrently undertaken by some housing departments.4.    In our opinion, local authorities should immediately review needs and services in their own areas in order to determine current priorities.    As acommittee we have not attempted this task, for it can be performed only inrelation to the needs and circumstances of specific areas, including their previous investment in particular services.5- However, we foresee that most local authorities are likely to feel thattoday children under five and very old people call for special attention and
some local authorities will have clear &quot;priority areas&quot; within their boundaries.for the nation as a whole we consider that the community approach indicated inohapter XVI and the training of staff for the social service department,including the field staff of the area teams and the staff for residential accommodation, will be crucial to the success of the new service.j3rief summary.__Q.f_.thg:-ggRPJIJPart 1 - Introduction and the present situation6,    In chapter II we discuss briefly the terms of reference and the backgroundI    to the enquiry.     Chapter III describes the procedure we adopted.     Chapter IV8    summarises briefly the history of the services with which we are concerned, andI    their present structure, which is described in greater detail in appendix P.I    Part 2 - ffhg^neej^for change and the iCTi.it should takem7.    In chapter V, we examine criticisms of the effectiveness of the presentservices, and reach the conclusion that substantial improvements could be made in them, and that organisational change and changes in the distribution of1    responsibilities between local authority committees and departments would balfour    important means to this end.mII    8.    In chapter VI, we examine the main proposals which we received for theI    reorganisation of the services.     We conclude that there are overridingI objections to all of them, apart from the proposal for a social service department,I -I 9.    In chapter VII, we consider the case for and against the proposed socialIf service department, stating our belief that it will provide better services forI those in need because it will ensure a more co-ordinated and comprehensivegjjI approach to the problems of individuals, families and communities, should be more1meffective in detecting need and encouraging people to seek help, should he ableto attract resources and use them more effectively, and should malce it possibleto plan more systematically for the future.^ ^-XjlJ^l&amp;ti^&amp;Jlg-eJJLs ,in, a, comprehensive service10.  \Jq g0 on to discuss particular groups of services and how they would beaffected by the creation of a social service department.     In chapter VIII wedeal with services for children and their families, emphasising in particular theneed for development of the social care services for children under five.     Werecommend that the social service department should he responsible for social careservices for schools and suggest ways in which these services should he organised
and developed.     We explain that, owing to lack of time and the need for anearly report, we have not been able to give adequate consideration to tho youth service and other services for young people but we recommend a comprehensiveenquiry into all these services.     As regards services for children in trouble with the law, we give a general welcome to the recently published White Paper,Children in Trouble, subject to reservations on a few points, notably on the age at which criminal prosecution should be possible, and the division ofresponsibility between the probation service and the social service department insupervising young offenders.     Finally in this chapter, we suggest how the childguidance service should bo related to the functions of the social service department and developed into a family guidance service.11.   There follows a chapter on services for old people (chapter IX), whichstresses the need for the social service department to concern itself particularly with the development of a more coherent pattern of provision for old people,including more effective measures for identifying those in need and meeting their needs early.     Chapter X deals with the services for the physically handicapped,including in particular the need for the social service department to concern itself with the provision of adequate housing and to help some particularlyvulnerable grbups of handicapped people - for example, school leavers, those whoare partially incapacitated in late middle life - to cope with their problems.12,   In chapter XI we tackle the particularly difficult problems presented bythe social services for the mentally ill and the mentally subnormal.     On the organisational issues, we conclude that junior training centres should be theresponsibility of the education department, but that other social services for the mentally ill and mentally subnormal, including the provision of hostels for allages and training centres for adults, should be the responsibility of the social service department.     This chapter, like the chapter on services for thephysically handicapped, stresses the need for teamwork between the social service department and the other services and organisations concerned with services forthe mentally ill and the mentally subnormal, and draws attention to the acute shortage of trained social workers.     We recommend that the social service department should have expert medical advice in planning and running the servicesfQr the mentally ill and mentally subnormal, perhaps a consultant psychiatristseconded from a hospital board on a part-time basis.     We stress also the
importance of bettor systems of research and intelligence through which bettermethods of meeting need can be evolved.13,   Chapter XII deals with some of the other services provided by health departments.     We recommend that the social service department should have theresponsibility for providing the home help service, partly because the grounds on which home helps are provided are largely social, and partly because providing a home help may be one way of preventing a child or old person being taken intoresidential care, which would be the responsibility of the social service department.     Social workers, apart from mental health social workers, at presentin health departments would also be transferred to the new social service department.     Health visitors should remain within health departments.     the concluding section of this chapter discusses the vitally important question ofthe future of local health departments in relation to the proposed social service department and to the possibility of a much wider recasting (which is outside our terms of reference) of the administrative structure of the National health service.Part 4 - Foundations of an effective service14.   We do not recommend any radical change in the pattern of responsibility for local authority housing, but in chapter XIII we emphasise the fundamental importance of adequate housing for the provision of an effective family serviceand, in particular, the need to pay special attention to the housing problems ofelderly and physically handicapped people, large families, and one-parent families.We urge that housing departments should take a wider view of their responsibilities and be specifically and directly concerned, not only withbuilding houses and managing those they own, but also with the whole range of housing problems of the area In question.     We are against any division of theresponsibility for housing - by, for example, giving the social service departmentresponsibility for letting and managing specific groups of houses for groups of people in special need.     In particular, we recommend that the responsibility foraccommodating homeless families, as distinct from providing limited overnightaccommodation, should be placed squarely on housing departments.     We suggestthat social workers from the social service department might be attached for all or Part of their time to housing departments in order to help deal with the moredifficult social problems among council tenants or people in need of housing.
o(J15.   Throughout the report, we are at pains to make clear that we do not regardour proposals as merely putting together existing local authority departments and parts of departments.     The new structure we propose should have much widerimplications, which are discussed in chapters XIV to  XVIII.     In chapter XIVwe explain how we see the social service department and other related servicesworking in the task of developing more effective preventive measures.16.   We have hoon particularly concerned about the lack of adequate systems of collecting and disseminating information about the working of the personal social services and the needs they ought to be meeting, and about the small amount of research agoing, on in these fields.     In chapter XV we make proposals forremedying these defects.17.   In chapter XVI, we set out our ideas on community development and the use of voluntary effort, emphasising that an effective family service cannot be providedwithout exploring new ways of using resources outside the local governmentstructure.Part 5 - Sp ecialdsa^ix^j^d^rjaining18.   Chapters XVII and XVIII deal with the inter-related issues of specialisationin social work, and with training for staff in the social service department -which will, of course, include many other kinds of staff apart from social workers.     In chapter XVII, we recommend a now approach to the issue ofspecialisation in social work, suggesting that at the basic field work levelsocial workers should move towards taking responsibility for the whole range of individual and family social problems, drawing on support in this from consultantswithin the social service department.     In chapter XVIII, we urge a considerable expansion in training for all groups of staff, and in particular for residentialstaff, and a unification of the present separate arrangements for training social workers. jHJLii^-Structure and implementation19.   In chapter XIX we discuss the structure and working of the proposed social vj.;;service department.     The basis of the department, in our view, should in mostparts of the country be teams of upwards of a dozen social workers, each teamserving populations of between 50,000 and 100,000, and with the maximum amount ofresponsibility delegated to them from the headquarters of the social service department,     For the time being, the social service department should be run by
1 R ha separate committee of the local authority, with a separate principal officerreporting directly to the council.     &quot;We envisage that in course of time most ofthe principal officers at the heads of the new departments would he professionallyqualified social workers with training in management and administration oradministrators with qualifications in social work.     We emphasise the importanceof close links between the social service department and other departments,notably the health, education and housing departments;     indeed this point cropsup throughout the report.     We discuss the respective roles of members and officers in running the personal social services, drawing attention to the delicate balance of the relationship between members and officers.20.   Our terms of reference excluded consideration of the organisation of centralgovernment, but nevertheless we thought it right in chapter XIX to point out thatreorganisation of services at local level v/ould not be effective unless it was accompanied by reorganisation at central government level, and in the structure of councils and committees advisory to Ministers in this field.     In particular,we see&apos;  an important place for a reorganised and strengthened central governmentinspectorate, with promotional, consultative and advisory functions, in helping the development of the new department.21.  Finally, in chapter XIX, we make specific suggestions about v/ays of resolvingsome difficult problems on the handling of confidential information, and bringtogether proposals mado in other parts of the report for the provision of medical advice to the social service department.22.   Chapter XX contains recommendations on the implementation of our proposals.We deal in particular with the relationship between our recommendations and what may emerge from the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Local Governmentin England.     We urge that our main proposals should be implemented without waiting for legislation on general local government reorganisation, mainly because of the need to improve the services as quickly as possible.     In the long-term, however, we recommend strongly that responsibility for the social service department, and for local health, education and housing functions should be discharged by the same tier of local government.23.   Chapter XXI deals with the implications of the Committee&apos;s recommendations for services outside their terms of reference - the Supplementary BenefitsCommission, the Probation and Aftercare Service, doctors, and medical social?,0rk in hospitals. . -. r,.  
(1)C.S.Q. National Income Expenditure 1966, table 53.Resources24.   The report is concerned throughout with resources:   how the existing resources can best be used;   what additional resources are likely to beavailable;   how these additional resources can be attracted.     An effectivefamily service cannot be provided without additional resources.     It would benaive to think that any massive additional resources will he made available inthe near future, not only on account of the present economic situation, but also because of the inevitable time lag in planning, recruitment, training and theconstruction of buildings.     The pace at which our recommendations areimplemented must bo a matter for political decision.     Nevertheless these considerations do not change our opinion that the reorganisation recommended in chapter VII must be started now, as the suggested changes will result in more efficient and economic functioning of the services, and are vital if moreresources are to be attracted and used sensibly.25.   It is as well to consider the size of the problem in terms of money and manpower.     The national expenditure on the Social Services in 1965 amounted to 5,479 million.     The net amountv 1  spent from public funds in 1965-66 on thelocal authority welfare and child care services on capital and revenue accountwas just under  100 million, only 1.8$ of the total (or .72$ of the G.N.P.).26.   The budget of the social service department will be about 46^0 higher thanthe combined expenditure of children&apos;s and welfare services, because it will alsobe responsible for relatively expensive items such as the home help service and parts of the mental health services.     Nevertheless, it will remain small inrelation to the total.     At appendix J we estimate the annual current expenditureof the social services department at about  113 million on 1965/6 figures whichcompared with a total local authority expenditure on revenue account of over 2,000 million.27.   In terms of manpower, it is estimated that in 1966 there were about 90,000people employed in the local authority services which we have proposed for inclusion in the social service department  (see appendix L). .. Among them were about 7,700 child care officers and social workers in health and welfaredepartments.     Even a modest increase in these categories could affect
significantly the effectiveness of a family service.     In particular, moregffective measures to prevent children having to be taken into residential carecould save heavy expenditure in other directions.     The cost of keeping a childin a remand home is now  20 per week or over  1,000 per annum;    the cost of keeping a child in an approved school is nearly as much, and the cost of keepinga child in a residential home is about  12 a week.     A qualified social workerearns  1,060- 1,435 a year, to which must be added the cost of supporting services.If an additional social worker can remove the need for even two children cominginto residential care the benefit to the community in terms of money alone isobvious,28.   Even more striking examples ca.n be given of how the use of home helpscould avoid much heavier expenditure on residential oare for children and old people.    Tho total cost of one whole-time home help is less than  1,000 a year.If the use of one home help on a full-time basis could avoid the need for a family of three to be taken into care, public money would be saved.29.  As will be clear from our recommendations, we are not of course saying thatthe solution to overy social problem must lie in greater use of social workers and home helps rather than the residential services.     What we are saying,however, is that providing services which lessen the need to take children aridadults into care is often right in itself and may be cheaper.CONFIDENTIAL10.6.10/68/
