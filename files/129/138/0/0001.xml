THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY rS GOVERNMENT)cMLsi COPY NO*CABINETMemo random by the Lord Privy seal the Future Legislation Committee, and subsequently theParliamentary Committee, have considered proposals for thelegislative programme for 1968-69.    The Lists at Annex B have beenprepared in the light of their discussions.    The Bills have been provisionally classified under the following heads:-Al   -   Essential Bills - that is, Bills which must be obtained by a specified date, e. g. because of theexpiration of other measures.A2   -   Contingent Bills - that is, Bills which may become essential in the above sense.B     - M^^Pro^r^mm^BjIlsC     - Bills in ReserveB(S) - Bills in the programme for the Scottish Grand CommitteeS     - Bills suitable for the Second Reading Committee procedureP    - Bills suitable for Private MembersD     -   B^Uj^whixhunlikely to find a place in it.The main programme has been divided into two: List B(i) contains bills which it is proposed should have a firm place in the programme, most ofwhich must be ready for introduction before Christmas, and List B(ii)contains Bills whose inclusion must depend on a decision, which cannotbe taken until about the end of the end of the year, on whether to intro^duce in the spring a Bill of medium length to implement some of theless controversial recommendations of the Royal Commission on TradeUnions and Employers&apos; Organisations.
2.      The lists are based on the assumption that we shall, have55 days available for legislation in the course of the Session.     this figure is in turn based on the average for the last ten years which, with my proposed distribution of time in 1968-69, are shown below:-	No.	of dajs	Average	Pr^O Oseji	1957-67	1968-69Debate on the Address	6	6Supply and Consolidated Fund Bills	30	32*Budget and Finance Bills	18!	16Private Members&apos; Bills and Motions	20	22*Adjournments at Recesses	4	4Contingencies, debates, Orders and		Regulations, Opposed Private		Business, etc.	26	25Legislation	-.56JL-	^5^__Total	161	160(*Revised Standing Orders now provide an extra 2 days for private Members1 business and additional 2 days for supply and Consolidated Fund Bills.)This tentative breakdown assumes that the new Session starts on29th October and that the Committee Stage of the F^nano^ J3JTL Vvill betaken on the floor of the House.    If, as I hope, it is decided to sendat least part of the Finance Bill upstairs, it should give us anotherthree to five days.3.     Annex A indicates the amount of time expected to be availablefor legislation in each of the Parliamentary terms.    Annex B givesestimates of the times which individual Bills may take on the floor ofthe House, with an indication of the terms of the Session in which the days will occur.    The allotments of business between terms are basedon averages over recent years,    The individual figures are speculative,but the total of the estimates is likely te be close to the outcome withthe exception of House of Lords and R^J^^^J^ratio^of J;he^eoph^,where the greatest uncertainty lies.    To meet comments made by mycolleagues, I have allowed 6 days on the floor for each of these Bills(1 day for Second Reading;  3 days Committee; 2 days for Report and third Reading), although the 1948 Representation of the People Billtook 11 days and the Parliament Bill, 1911 (which was perhaps lesscomparable) 22 days.    Because of these Bills, and the possibility thatwe may want to introduce a medium length Industrial Relations Bill,the scope for other Bills is more than usually limited.    The timetableassumes that, subject to their inclusion in the programme, hmrnigj^ion,M^^Ji^^ttiPB-^17th^t^ * ^wJ^Sl^^i-lMi^SSl^i^-SllpJ&apos; Town^andCountr^JPlan^ and all Second Reading Committee Billswill start in the House 01 Lords.    It does not provide for a Ports Billin 1968-69.    If the Cabinet were to decide that such a Bill must go intothe programme, then either transport i^London or VehiclesR gilt?3li9Jlii^ would have to be deferred to 1969-70,and the opportunity for introducing Bills in List B(ii) would also bereduced.
4.      The Al, A2, B(i), Scottish Bills and Second Reading CommitteeBills are likely to need 53 days.     On the assumption that 55 areavailable, this leaves, apart from the Finance Bill which is providedfor separately, 2 days for other legislation, including industrial relations: time could be found for more only by dropping otherprogramme Bills.    I have therefore considered what additional timecould be made available for legislation if we -(a) reduce the Christmas and Whitsun recesses to3 weeks and 1 week, respectively;(b) have an autumn spill-over of 2 weeks;(c) send the Finance Bill to Standing Committee.5.     I have not made any addition to allow for time made available by sending the Finance Bill upstairs.    The amount that could be saved is speculative and not likely to be large.    It ought to beregarded as a reserve not to be allocated at this stage, since if webase our initial programme on short recesses we shall pre-empt mostof the reserve capacity which a cut in the recesses otherwise provides;and we know from experience that some Bills which cannot now be clearly foreseen will inevitably have to be added to the programme during the Session.6,      The Select Committee on Procedure are expected to report this summer on changes in the terms of the Session.    They may recommenda move from four terms to five or six, while retaining the presentaverage Session of 160 or so days.    If the House accepted these recommendations they could not be implemented until 1969-70 at theearliest because of the planning of the Party conferences; and I have accordingly based my calculations on a renewal of the current termtime.7.      The additional time which would result would be availableentirely for Government legislation and contingencies;   the provisionfor Supply.    Private Members&apos; time, etc., would remain unchanged.However, of the additional time for legislation I have assumed a need of 3 days for Lords Amendments.    This is more than the average.But it is related to the 5 days or so that we shall need this Session:this higher-than-average figure presumably arises because of thelate introduction of Bills which has led to more Amendments in bothHouses.    If this tendency can be checked, less than 3 days may be needed for this purpose,8.      The total effect of these changes would, I estimate, be toprovide 18 days more for legislation, of which it would be prudent to earmark 1 for non-legislative business and 3 for Lords Amendments.The net additional 14 legislative days are subject to the limitationsindicated in the notes in Annex C.    Briefly, the later in the Sessionthey occur the less valuable they are for legislation other than short and minor Bills; their addition would not enable us to introduce asubstantial Bill late in the Session.    This is relevant to the timing of M F^ilai^j5hi2pin^ which I have been urged to include in theS EC RET
programme for 1968-69.     Mf-I^-^SL^iEE^S could not be ready untilthe end of March, 1969, because drafting could not be started untilthose Bills in List B(i) which must be introduced before Christmaswere ready.    If an attempt were made to introduce this Bill late we might find ourselves, notwithstanding a reduction in the whitsun recess and autumn over-spill, in similar difficulties to those whichhave beset us with this Session&apos;s late Bills, and there could be noquestion of including this Bill in the programme if both industrial relations and Ports went in.    Drafting might usefully begin early inthe New Year, however, in order that the Bill might be ready for introduction at the outset of the 1969-7 0 Session.    This would enableprovision to be made during the course of drafting for such of therecommendations of the Committee on Trawler Safety under AdmiralMilner-Holland as the Government may decide to accept.9.     The Cabinet should be aware that among the Bills put forv/ardfor next Session, but not included in the provisional programme, isone on Ei-g^arjette^dverti^sjn^, to which the Minister of Health attachesimportance.    The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the statement which the Minister made in the House of Commons on 23rd October(Official Report 23rd October, 1967, Cols. 1328-9) with the authorityof the Home Affairs Committee, that in view of the danger to healthfrom cigarette smoking and of the failure of the manufacturers to agreeto voluntary ending of coupon schemes and limitation of other forms of sale promotion, &quot;the Government have decided to introduce legislation in due course to take power to ban coupon gift schemes, to forbid orlimit certain forms of cigarette advertising, and to limit expenditureon advertising of  cigarettes&quot;.     The Minister of Health takes the viewthat legislation ought not to be deferred beyond the 1968-69 Session,and it may well be that if the Bill is not included in the programme theindustry ought to be informed that the Government have abandoned their intention of legislating.    An alternative might be to prepare a Bill to be handed to a Private Member if one could be found willing to introduceit, but the Government would have to declare its position on such aBill;  it could not adopt an attitude of neutrality.Summary and Conclus ion10.     Against the Sessional average of 55 days for government legislation the following are expected to be required:-Al Bills 5 A daysA2 Bills 6B(i) Bills 37iScottish Bills 3Second Reading Committee Bills 2Total 5 3 daysRemainder 2 daysAddition for legislation from:-(i)   Shorter Christmas Recess     )(ii)   Shorter Whitsun Recess )       18 days(iii)   Autumn Spill-over )Thus, there could be 20 days (including the 2 remaining above), of which1 might be needed for non-legislative business and 3 for lords amendments.

I suggest that the Cabinet should -(a) approve Lists Al and A2, B(i), the Scottish List and theSecond Reading Committee list, on the understanding thatSecond Reading Committee Bills will not take priority overmain programme Bills for drafting and will be introduced ona &quot;first come first served&quot; basis!(b) agreed that Port^should not be introduced in 1968-69;(c) agree that we should plan provisionally for three weeksrecess at Christmas, one week at Whitsun and a two weekautumn spill-over;(d) on this basis approve the inclusion in the programme of tourism, Atomic Energy, Air Corporations, IndustrialDevelopment, and if judged desirable in the light of consultation on the Report of Royal Commission, Indjistri^al^Relatiors;(e) agree that if Industrial Relations is not required in 1968-69,Gas Industry^ Drugs and Mines and Quarries Act 1954(Amejidment) should be brought forward, and that Bills in(d) and (e) should be drafted as resources allow so as to beavailable for introduction when openings occur;(f) agree that as drafting resources become available MerchantShippingshould be drafted with a view to introduction at thebeginning of 1969-70.T.

secret &apos; &apos; &apos;    1 6ANNEX CNOTES ON THE USE OF TIME OBTAINED BY REDUCING- TEECHRISTMAS AND WHITSuNlaiCESSES AND, BY ADDING- AN AUTUMN SPILL-OVERChristmas RecessA week off the Christmas recess would result in an adjournment of2k- clear days - probably the shortest, if only marginally, Christmas roocssever.     But I do not think that that matters particularly if it conformsto the report due from the Select Committee.     The five days which thoweek would bring could all be taken for legislation subject to Bills being available.    For example, they could not be used on Industrial Relationsbut they could go to such measures as Gas (two days) and Air Corporations(two days).Whibsun RecessOn the assumption that the House would, as is usual, re-assembleon a Tuesday, a reduction from two weeks adjournment to one would providea further four days for legislation.    Here again, the use of the time-would depend on the state of preparedness of Bills.     For new Business, otherthan legislation to be taken on the floor or minor Bills, this term is of little value.    Even a Bill of average size started in the Commons andto have its Committee stage upstairs, would have little hope of completingits stages in both Houses in the ten weeks available including the spill-over.     Good use however could obviously be made of the time, providingsuitable Business is ready, by advancing new Business from term 4- toterm 3 and making balancing adjustments between terms.     This procedure would not, however, be suitable for major Bills such as Merchant jSJaijj-ingwhioh clearly should be introduced no later than term 2.Autumn spill-overExperience shows that autumn spill-overs are little use forGovernment legislation in the Commons, excepting for the later stages of comparatively minor legislation or for Lords Amendments.     It does,however, enable some of the provision for annual debates to be postponedand for more time to be taken on legislation before the summer adjournment,I mention this to show that sittings in the autumn do not mean that legislation can be left until the very end of the Session.     It is perhaps(8)secret
worth, mentioning that these spill-overs, which occur ah out every otherSession, have mainly arisen &quot;because of decisions to meet partioularsituations by emergency debates;   examples of this are Suez, Rhodesia,Economic Situation.     If the pattern of summer adjournments and PartyConferoncos is maintained in 19^9 it might be found convenient to limitany autumn term to a fortnight.    If so we might find it in convenient to have organised Business filling the whole tern with an opportunity should there be need, for an emergency debate.(9)
