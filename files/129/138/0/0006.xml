IISDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYl3 GOVERNMENT) (68) 86 COPY NO.16th July, 1968CABINETPUBLIC SCHOOLS COMMISSION: FIRST report note by the Secretary of State for Education and science the First Report of the Public Schools Commission will bepublished on 23rd July.    Annex I sets out the Commission^ terms ofreference and Annex II outlines its major conclusions and recommendations,2.      Decisions on the substance of the report cannot be taken until there has been time for it to be considered by all those concerned.    Ipropose therefore that I should not make any statement on the publicationof the report;  but that, after the Recess, I should announce theGovernments decision that it would be inadvisable either to accept orreject the Commission^ main proposals at this stage because;(a) The same problems of independence and comprehensiveness will affect both day and boarding independent schools.(b) The issues of integration are so far-reaching and emotive that public opinion ought to be given an opportunity for expression before decisions on integration are reached.(c) Integration along the lines suggested could not, for financial reasons, be set in train in the foreseeable future.3.     These proposals are to be discussed by the Ministerial Committeeon Social Services today.    I am also consulting the Committee on the related but separate issue of charitable privileges.    The commission have recommended that those independent schools which are charitiesshould be deprived of the reliefs which they enjoy as such from incometax, rates and the Selective Employment Tax.E.W.S.IIIDepartment of Education and Science, W,l.16th July, 1968
ANNEX 1FUBLIC SCHOOLS COMAIS3ION - TERSE OF reference the main function of the Corneas don will be to advise on the best wayof integrating the public schools with the State system of education.     For thein-mediate purpose of the Commission public schools are defined as thoseindependent schools now in.membership of the Headmasters Conference, GoverningBodies Association or Governing Jiodies of Girls Schools Association.The Commission will &quot;be expected to carry out the following tasks;(a)   To collect and assess information about the public schools and aboutthe need and existing provision for boarding education^   forms of collaboration between the schools (in the first instance the boarding-schools) and the maintained system.fb) To work out the role which individual schools might play in national and local schemes of integration.(c) If it so wishes, and subject to the approval of the Secretary ofState, to initiate experimental schemes matching existing provisionwith different types of need.(d) To recommend a national plan for integrating the schools with themaintained sector of education.(e) To recommend whether any action is needed in respect of other independent schools, whether secondary or primary.In carrying out its tasks the Commission will be expected (whilerespecting the denominational character of the   schools), to pay special attention to the following objectives?(a) To ensure that the public schools should make their maximumcontribution to meeting national educational needs, and in the firstinstance any unsatisfied need for boarding education in the light ofthe Martin&apos; and Newsoin reports.?(b) To create a socially mixed entry into the schools in order both to achieve (a) above and to reduce the divisive influence which they nowexert,(c) To move towards a progressively wider range of academic attainmentamongst public school pupils, so that the public school sector mayincreasingly conform with the national policy for the maintained sector.(d) To co-operate closely with local education authorities in seeking to match provision with need for boarding education.Report of the Working-Party on Assistance with the Cost of BoardingEducation, H. &apos;k. 8.0., 19 60,Half Our Future - A report of the Central Advisory Council for Education(England), H.k.S.O., 1963.- 1 -

Our general conclusion is tha&apos;- independent schools are a divisiveinfluence in society.    The pupils, the schools and the country would bene/it if they admitted children from a wider social background,,   We recommend ascheme of integration by which suitable boarding schools should make over atleast a half if their plaoes to assisted pupils who need boarding education.This ohange v;ill take time, and not all schools can be brought within theintegrated sector simultaneously.    The details should be worked out schoolby school., by.a body we shall call the Boarding Schools Corporation.Our main conclusions and recommendations are as follows,  (references to paragraphs in the report being shown in brackets):Integration1,     Independent boarding schools suitable and willing to enter an integratedsector should be given every encouragement to do so.    There should be a firstcondition that a school must admit assisted pupils from maintained schools toat least a half of its places - by the end of a build-up period of aboutseven years.     (253)2.     Most schools, and especially boys&apos;  schools, should admit pupils of a wider range of ability.   With very few exceptions,  they should cater forpupils including those of an ability level corresponding with that requiredfor courses leading to the Certificate of Secondary Education.    They shouldbe encouraged where possible also to admit children below this level ofability.   Very few children with boarding need should be excluded from theopportunity of a place at an integrated school on grounds of low academicability.   It will be possible to achieve a wide range of ability within a smaller annual agegrrup than in most maintained day schools because classes are normally smaller in boarding schools.    (278-279)3.    Where schools are too small to admit, children of widely differing abilityover the whole age range, they should adapt as far as possible to the comprehensive system by shortening their courses and adjusting their ages of admission.    (264)   For example   a group of schools having a commonfoundation or religious, educational or other bonds might between them cover the whole secondary age range and a very wide span of ability.    (293)4.    Although the great majority of integrated schools should adopt these principles, there could be possible exceptions  to the pattern:(1) A Tery small number of schools should be enabled tn reorganisethemselves to cater wholly or mainly for pupils at the sixth formlevel.    (281 to 287)(ii) One or two schools might become &quot;academies&quot; catering for childrenwith special aptitudes in music or ballet.    (288)(iii) Proposals to cater entirely for gifted children from an earlyage should be viewed with considerable caution, but are not excluded by our recommendations.    (29b)Ajgogiatibn;- with&apos; maintaineds ehonls5.     Independent boarding schools should be encouraged to work closely notpnly -,,ith each other   but with maintained day schools    with which they mightshore teaching re sources and other facilities   and whose boarding needs theymight help to meet.    (295)1. Wfe.ANNEX &quot;t       109Public Schools^ Cjsmmission - First ReportConclusions and recommendations
Aidedjsja.tus110g     For schools wishing to come within the maintained system there should beopportunities of &quot;aided&quot; status - that is, of a relationship with the Stateequivalent to that of voluntary aided schools   but possibly in associaticn,-pth a central body rather than a local education authority.    (296, 297)Joint provision7,    Local education&apos;authorities   in consultation with governing bodies    shouldwhere practicable plan ne?; comprehensive schools to wcrk closely Kithintegrated boarding schools.    It should be made legally possible for themto build by agreement on an independent school site and to arrange for joint responsibility for the resulting school.    (272)Girls&apos; schools lst8.     Most girls&apos;  schools are (because of limitations of size and academicprovision) less well poised for integration than boys&apos; schools;    even if theywere all suitable they could provide only about a half as many places as boys&apos;schools.   It may therefore be necessary to take up places at schools not immediately suitable for integration until the integrated sector can acc*m-accommodate all girls in need of boarding education.    Schools which are small butare otherwise suitable for integration should be encouraged to make&quot;tiering&quot; or similar arrangements with other schools.    (127, 128, 3^0)Co-education9.     There should be more co-educational boarding schools, in order t* meetthe wishes and convenience of parents of both boys and girls, and also toextend opportunities of boarding education for girls.     Some of thelarger boys&apos; schools in particular should be encouraged to adapt themselves for this role.      (301 ,302).Bpardin^for^ voung^ children10.   Where boarding at primary school age is essential, assisted places should first be sought in the junior schools or departments *f integratingsecondary schools and then in other preparatory schools.     preference should be given to preparatory schools which are Tailing to become co-educational and to enter into schemes of integration. (303)11.   If there are&apos;children who cannot spend holidays at home or with relationsCijldrcn&apos;s Departments or other child care agencies should be invited to help.Failing this, it may be desirable for integrated schools to take it inturns to accommodate during holidays any children who have nowhere else to(307)Immigrants12.   The schools may have a valuable role to play in the education ofimmigrant children, and there should be no discrimination against them inallocating places.  (308)
Ex2&apos;-snfic of tonohers13.   An interflow ol teachers should develop between the maintained and independent sector in boys&apos; schools to match that already taking place in&quot;iris&apos; schools.     In particular,   a scheme should bo established for theexcahnge of a hundred masters a year (312)14.   The inspection of boarding schools should in future take mere account ofthe conditions and customs in the schools so as to judge how suitable they arcas boarding communities for pupils of widely differing backgrounds. (311)Governors15.   Governing bodies of integrating schools should include one third of membersrepresenting bodies or interests other than the Foundation.     (314)II, Denominational schools16.   schools-ls which are Christian foundations (as most public schools are), shouldbe   encouraged to accept pupils from denominations other than their own, aswell as pupils of other religions or of no religion. (345)17.   There should be suitable safeguards for the conscience of parents inmatters of religious worship and instriction.   There is a case for extendingchoice in these natters also to senior pupils. (347,348).III. Changes ax integrating schools18.   In order to meet   the needs of assisted pupils, particularly those from maintained day schools, integrating schools will have to adaptthemselves radically.     This must not mean sacrificing important traditionsand values, in particular those of hard work, good relations between pupilsand staff and the wide variety of extra-curricular activities which manyschools provide.     But the style of life should be reconsidered.     Inparticular s (233 - 241).(i) There should be more women on the staffs of boys&apos; schools and more men on the staffs of girls&quot; schools. (233)(ii) Lore opportunities should be provided for pupils to pursue theirown personal interests in their leisure time.     (241)(iii) There should be more alternatives to Cadet Force activities andcore choice and variety in games.    (239)(iv) Contacts with home, through weekly boarding where practicable, shouldbe encouraged. (240)(v) There could be greater freedom in forms of dress at some schools,particularly at we-kends.     Eccentric or unduly expensive school uniformsshould be avoided. (239)3.
(vi) The prcfectorial system may need to be modified so that excessiveauthority is not wielded by pupils?   there should be no beating of boys by boys and no personal fagging.   (234s 236, 238)jY;fiihsjdics for private education    19.    By a majority we recommend that action should be taken to terminate the fiscal and similar reliefs of schools which are charities but which do notsorve a truly charitable purpose.    (366)20. suggest that Parliament should consider whether action should be taken1    to change fiscal policies which enable school foes to be paid otherwise thanS    fror-i parents&apos; income.1    (.375)V, Boarding Need -I    21.    The only justification for public expenditure on boarding education should be need fcr boarding, for either social or academic reasons.   Socialgrounds would include circumstances in which a child is seriously deprived of reasonable possibilities of educational development because of the absenceI    of a hone in this country or because of adverse home or family conditions.Educational need may arise, whatever the home circumstances, if a child isI    unable to obtain education suited to his or her needs within daily travellingdistance, or if the parents have to move home frequently in the nature of theirj    work.   These criteria should be interpreted rigorously.    (156)22.    Applying a rigorous interpretation of need, we estimate that 80,000children will require boarding places in schools of all kinds by I98O (inEngland and Wales).   We recommend that&apos;places for 45?000 of these pupils shouldbe sought in independent schools.    An addition of 2,000 places for scotland would make a total of 47*000 assisted boarding pupils in independent schools.(210, 224, 225)23.     20,000 places are; already taken up wholly or partly at public expensein independent schools (out of a total of 138,000 boarding places, includingScotland).   Our proposal is that a further 27,000 pupils should be assisted,and that all assisted pupils should attend schools approved for integration.About 38,000 of the 47,000 pupils might bo in secondary schools or departments and about 9,000 in preparatory schools or departments.    (224-226)VI. Selection of assisted pupils24.    Guidance on boarding and placing policy should be given by the BoardingSchools Corporation to regional consortia of local education authorities, which(at any rate after the early stages) would handle the main volume of applications for pupils resident in this country.    (323)The Chancellor of the Exchequer, in his Budget speech on 19th March, I968,proposed measures affecting the taxation of minors&apos; income and tax relief on certain kinds of insurance policy.4.
IF25.   The Corporation would deal centrally with applications for sixth for..:colleges and academies (if any) and night also more conveniently receive applica-tions&apos; from parents working overseas. (335*336,337)26.   The staffs of maintained schools and cf welfare agencies should be encouragedtc uring opportunities of boarding education to the notice cf parents whosechildren tight benefit from then. (321)27.   There should be no obligation upon parents to accept a place in aparticular school, and alternatives should do suggested whore ever possible.Similarly, heads of schools.Is should not bo obliged to accept a particular child,although this right should not oc used as a means of preserving- academic or social selection. (332,333)28.   Places should be offered in schools as near as possible to pupils&apos; homes.Where they are offered at a distance, it would be desirable- for a group ofchildren fro;., the locality to go to the same schools.     Flexible (i.e, weekly orother periodic) boarding arrangements should be encouraged. (327?328)29,   Places in maintained and direct grant boarding schools should be regarded asthe equivalent of places in independent schools5    the aim is a bearding policy for all grant aided and integrated independent boarding schools,     Localeducation authorities and governors of direct grant schools should be encouraged to make boarding places in their schools available to the corporation and regional consortia.    (329)iVII. Assistance to parents30.   All as isted pupils, whatever their parents&apos; means, should be entitled to free tuition equivalent to the average cost of education in maintained day     schools. (377,378,379)31.   Parental contributions should be made (according tc means) towards therercining cost of an assisted place. (380,381)32.   Although the full cost of each place would be paid to the school by theCorporation, a standard cost-adjusted separately for primary (or preparatory)and secondary schools-should be attributed to each assisted place-, so thatthe charge to parents would not vary according to the school attended. (380)33.   &apos;*e recommend a scale of contributions identical in the lower rantesof income to the present university awards scale, but graduated more steeplyat income levels exceeding  2,000 a year. (393)34.   We estimate an average net annual cost to public funds for each assistedsecondary place of  408 at 1966/67 cost figures.     This includes essential extras,adninist:ative costs, and.an allowance for capital development and for special assistance to parents at the lowest income levels.   The equivalent preparatoryschool cost is  323,    (410)Cost of integration35.    The take-up of 38,000 secondary and 9?000 preparatory places would cost I8.4 million annually,    (412)36.     A modified scheme for the take-up of 32,000 places as an interim measure would cost  12,5 uillion annually.    (435)37.    There would be offsetting savings of  6.4 million a year now paid by government Departments and local education authorities for pupils assistedunder present arrangements, making the net costs of the full and interimschemes  12 million and  6.1 million respectively.    (423, 435)
38,    There would be further savings to public funds, of  2 to  3 million ae;,r? resulting from our recommendation   19 above, and further substantial savings if Parliament decided to take action in the light of recommendation201.   (421)30,    If the modified scheme were adopted as an interim measure, it should takethe form of full integration of a smaller number of schools - not partialintegration of a large number,    (426)40.     Assistance from public funds for pupils (other than handicapped pupils)attending independent schools should, after a date to be decided, be re-restricted to those attending schools accepted for integration,    (4175 475)41.    The cost of assisted places (subject to parental contributions) shouldbo met by local education authorities on a pooled basis.    A variant of normalpooling would be to distribute the cost among authorities in such a way as to adjust their contribution in proportion to the number of pupils in their areanot receiving education at the authority&apos;s expense.    (442, 443)4?.     The pcoled expenditure should qualify for grant from the Exchequer,taking into account (in addition to normal rate support grant) any savingsaccruing to the Exchequer at 37 and 38 above. (441)43.     Future capital development at integrated schools should be subject to approval by the Boarding Schools Corporation, and should where necessary bemet from loans amortised through fee income (the cost thus being borne by fee-paying and assisted pupils alike).    (451? 452)44.    The Corporation should have the power to approve the level of fees to becharged at any integrating independent school, and a reserve power to approve the fees at other independent boarding schools in certain circumstances.(448-450)/III. Maintained schools45.     In areas where there is a shortage of boarding places which theintegrated independent sector can only partially relieve, there should bepiovisicn for more maintained boarding schools,&apos; to be provided by localeducation authorities on a basis which would enable the capital cost to beamortised through fees and thereby pooled.    (457? 458)IX. Legislation and Administration46.     There should be an Education Act enabling an integrated&apos; sector to developunder the guidance of a Boarding Schools Corporation.   The Corporation shouldhave assurance of funds to facilitate forward planning.    (463,470)47.     Schools should be invited to submit development plans as a basis for negotiation?   but no school would have a prescriptive right to be accepted forintegration.    (465)48.     The Secretary of State should have the power in the last resort to compela school to enter into a scheme of integration if all efforts at negotiation and persuasion should f vail, and if a school&apos;s refusal to enter the scheme would prejudice a successful integration policy.    (478)49.    There should bo prevision for schools and parents to appeal against decisions of the Corporation or regional consortia.    (480)See footnote to recommendation 20 above.6.
X, Scotland and Wales50.    Ws recognise that a scheme of integration appropriate to England andHales i-ay not be applicable to Scotland;    a different kind of scheme would be acceptable provided it opened opportunities of bearding educationtc pupils who required it.    (511)51.    We also accept that Wales, although subject to the same educationallegislation and financial arrangements as England, has special problems which;;i?y call for different solutions.    (527)XL Unrecognisod schools52. Wo endorse the Secretary of State&apos;s decision to require all independentschools with boarding pupils tc reach an efficient standard.    (537)&apos;7.
