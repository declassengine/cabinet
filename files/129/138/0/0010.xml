SD0CU1&quot;,/lENT IS THE PR.OPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVEE.N1.IENT)6C(68) 90 COPY NO.29th July, I960CONCORDEMemorandum by the Minister of TechnologyConcorde has been under development for 5-1 years.    The twoprototypes are now virtually complete, but a complex programme of ground checks and testing has to be completed before they can fly.Work on the tv/o pre-production aircraft is going aheadj and preliminaryauthorities have been given for initial orders of materials and tooling forthe production programme proper.     The firms1 target date for the firstflight is now October/November, but British and French officialsconsider that a more likely date is January/February, 1969.    (Theproblems of estimating the likely date are discussed in Annex C).Flight at a Mach number of 2 (the design cruising speed) is unlikely to be achieved before the autumn of 1969.     The firms&apos; target date for certification of airv/orthiness is October, 1971, which v/ouldenable deliveries to airline service to begin before the end of thatyear, but this again is probably optimistic, and the view of officialsis that whilst spring 1972 is probably the earliest date for certification,it may not be achieved before the autumn of 1972.2. The latest report to British and French Ministers by the ConcordeDirection Committee (CDC. 24 of 7th June, 1968) is at Annex A,Technical Prospects3.      If Concorde is to be saleable it must obtain certificates of airworthiness from the British, Freuch and American airworthinessauthorities, must be accepted by civil aviation authorities around theworld without operating restrictions that would be unacceptable to the airlines (the chief cause for anxiety being take-off noise) and must offer a performance that most of the major long-haul airlines regard as adequate.    This may in turn be defined as the ability to carry,without significant restriction on account of seasonal factors orweather conditions, an economic pay load non-stop between paris and New York,4.      Many difficulties which once seemed daunting have been overcome.    However, Concorde!s chances of achieving the objectivesset out in the preceding paragraph, and in particular of achieving the required level of performance, are finely balanced.    (Whilst complete failure to obtain certification is most unlikely, this by itself will be of little use if the performance criteria cannot be met).
Performance5.       officials latest estimates, based on test results, indicate that-lirnitations due to take-off weight and fuel capacity may reduce the pay-loads on the critical Paris/New York mission to well below the targetfigures of 20,000 lbs. at initial certification (&quot;stage 0&quot;) and 25, 000 lbs.at final certification (&quot;stage 1&quot;).6.       There are a number of ways in which these reductions could be restored (for example, by increase in engine thrust during the later stages of the climb to cruise altitude, increase in fuel capacity, andpossibly by improvements in engine nozzle efficiency).    These arebeing investigated and some of them, particularly increases in enginethrust are within our grasp now.    Further improvements in performancecould be achieved by increasing the engine thrust during take-off but thiswould increase the lateral noise.7.       These assessments are the best that officials can make at thepresent time: the uncertainties associated with the assessment of performance are however still significant.    Taking the most pessimisticview the performance of Concorde would be wholly uneconomic:  at theother end of the scale the target Paris/New York payloads could beachieved comfortably.     The firms hold strongly to this latter view.8,       That an uncertainty band of this magnitude exists now is noreflection on the integrity and magnitude of the theoretical and experimental work done to date: in scope this far exceeds theprogramme for any previous British aircraft project, civil or military.    The basic source of the difficulty is that the payloadfor Concorde, as for any other etipersonic transport (SS.T), is less than 7 per cent of the take-off weight (25,000 lbs. out of380, 000 lbs. ),     There is unlikely to be any significant reductionin the magnitude of the uncertainties until the performance of theprototypes has been measured in sustained flight at a Mach numberof 2 (i, e. autumn of 1969),9,       The amount of payload carried could also be increased if smallconcessions were made in certain operational requirements.    Forexample, out of a total fuel weight of nearly 200,000 lbs,, one-fifth(40, 000 lbs. or more than lj times the payload) consists of fuel reserves.Only part of these reserves are required to meet safety regulations:  theremainder are specified by the airlines to ensure regularity of operation.Any reduction in these reserves acceptable to the airlines could clearly have a dramatic effect on overall performance.    (A reduction inregularity of operation from 99.6 per cent - the level achieved bycurrent aircraft such as the Boeing 707 - to 98 per cent is equivalentto 6, 500 lbs. of payload).    Again, Concorde is designed to meet take-off standards and regulations which, because of the advanced nature ofthe project, are unusually severe.    If Concorde!s handling characteris-tics turn out to be as good as has been predicted theoretically and byground simulation it might be possible to negotiate relaxations herewith corresponding benefit to the payload/range equation.    relaxing the regulations to the standard currently in force for subsonic aircraft -the maximum relaxation likely to be achieved - would give a gain inpayload of about 6, 000 lbs.
Noise10.       The target for airfield noise for Concorde remains that it shall beno greater than the noise from current civil jet aircraft.    The latest estimates show that this target is still achievable, but the uncertaintiesin the estimate are such that at worst noise could be of a level whichwould seriously restrict the operation of the aircraft from major worldairports.    Here again the uncertainty is unlikely to be reduced until theaircraft has flow/n, but the intention is to make noise assessment one ofthe earliest measurements of the flight programme.11.       In short, we are unlikely to be able to forecast the performanceoutcome more clearly until Concorde has flown and undergone several months of flight testing.     The above analysis v/ill continue to representthe best judgment that can be made of the balance between success and failure for at least a year, although during that year there will be stages in the improvement of our knowledge.Development Costs12.      I explained in my paper C(68) 4 of 3rd January, 1968, that if theexisting development timetable were maintained and things wentreasonably well, the total extramural development costs to theBritish and French Governments might be in the region of  550 million,but that if it proved impracticable to maintain the existing programmeunchanged, these costs might rise to  650-2700 million.    These figurescompared with a published estimate of  500 million (all at 1966 prices).It is important that we should not publicise a higher figure, except inagreement with the French in implementation of our aim to set an agreedupper limit to the commitment of the tv/o Governments and until the targetcosts for the incentive contracts have been established.    The latest estimates agreed by British and French officials (as given in paragraph 13of Annex A) lie within a range of  600- 700 million at 1968 price levels(corresponding to  530- 680 million at 1966 prices).    The implications of these figures from Her Majesty&apos;s Governments point of view areexplored in Annex B (paragraphs 1-8).Selling Price13.       The latest estimates by British and French officials, made priorto the recent French strikes, indicate that if the manufacturers are tomake a profit on production and the two Governments are to secure a modest recovery on their investment in development (see paragraphs 10(a)and (b) of Annex B) the aircraft will have to be sold at an average unitprice of not less than $22 million (i. e. not less than  9.16 million)(Annex A - paragraph 21).    For the purposes of the calculations in annex B, a selling price averaging  9, 5 million over 100 aircraft has been assumed.    This average price has also been assumed inmy Departments latest estimates of market prospects, which Idescribe below.    The production costs and the selling price ar.ecentral questions and will of course have to be specifically reviewed in the light of the effect on French costs of the recent strikes.
Economic Prospects14.       The Concorde Economic Prospects Committee, in their report ofJanuary, 1967, gave a probable range of 00 to ISO as their estimate of thenumbers of Concorde likely to be sold up to 1975 when the American SSTwas expected to enter service.    This was on the assumption that super-sonic flying over land would be restricted to uninhabited or sparsely-populated areas.    They thought that the total market for supersonicairliners between 1976 and 1980 might be equivalent to about 80 moreConcordes, but that how many of these would actually be Concordeswould depend on the competition offered by the American SST,     Theconclusions of this report have recently been reviewed by my Department,with the result that our current estimate of sales up to the time that theAmerican SST enters service (which is now estimated to be 1977) is aprobable range of 60 to 135.    Allowing for further sales of Concordesafter 1977 we arrive at a probable range of 70 to 165 for total sales,assuming that the aircraft is a technical success.    The British aircraft corporation (BAC) estimate of sales is substantially higher (250),15.      If all overland supersonic flight is banned, my department scurrent estimate of total sales is a probable range of 55 to 135.16.       These forecasts may be compared with the present total of 74delivery positions reserved by 16 airlines.    These reservations, madein exchange for a cash deposit, are in effect  or a place in the Concordequeue, and a means by which airlines that have declared themselvespotential customers may influence the design of the aircraft.    No freshreservations have been made since April, 1967, nor are any expected inthe immediate future.    The 16 airlines include all the major potentialoperators, and the prospect of a place in the queue beyond those already taken up is not likely to attract further customers at this stage;  nor canfirm orders be expected until Concorde&apos;s technical success is assured.The airlines&apos; tactics will be to wait until Concorde&apos;s prospects of successcan be more conclusively evaluated and the status of its rivals is clearerbefore committing themselves further.    This probably means that nofurther options can be expected until the first firm orders have beenplaced or are at least in the final stages of negotiation.Financial Prospects17, The financial prospects as seen by my Department (there hasnot been sufficient time to discuss them with other Departments) areanalysed in some detail in Annex B to this memorandum. The main points are as follows:(a)    Assuming that all expenditure up to 31st December, 1968 (theearliest date for possible cancellation suggested in SEP(68) 16) isignored, and on certain other assumptions described in paragraphs10 and 11 of Annex 3, the prospects in terms of balance of paymentsbenefits, of implied subsidy, and of implied preference for foreign exchange are as follows:
&apos;8197 &apos;Balance of payments benefitsImpliedsubsidyper centImpliedpr-eferenceper centNcmber of.aircraft soldUndiscounted  millionDiscounted  millionrn70120165433740101929347060822^-549-29ice(b) Cancellation on 31st December, 1968, provided it could-be donein agreement with the French, would result in savings of  110- 230 mil-lion (see paragraph 6 of Annex B). But it would involve the sacrifice ofthe prospects described above.(c) If we continue beyond 31st December, 1968, for a further sixmonths, we shall have to spend a further  25 million on development and commit a further  10 million to production - a total of  35 million(see paragraphs 7 and 9 of Annex B).(d) If we continue for a full year beyond 31st December, 1968, thecorresponding figures would be of the order of  50 million for development and  25 million for production - a total of  75 million (see paragraphs and 9 of Annex B).18.      We have always recognised that if we were to abandon Concordewithout agreement with the French, they might take us to the international court of Justice.    If a settlement v/ere reached on the basis of our having to pay them the cost of completing our share of the development programme, then the  140- 230 million quoted in paragraph 3of Annex B may be taken as a broad measure of what we mighthave to pay.    If a settlement v/ere based on our having to refundto the French the money they had already committed, then (since their expenditures have hitherto run roughly parallel with ours) apossible measure of the settlement is the  145 million spent on-  -development to 31st December, 1968, cancellation charges of  30- 50million, plus  5 million for production - a total of  180- 200 million(see paragraphs 3, 5 and 9 of Annex B),Conclusions19,      The decision that we have to make on Concorde is a very important one.    It is important first because of the sheer size of the project and the organisations, skills and people involved in it.    It is the biggest inter--national aircraft project ever undertaken, the biggest industrial project of any kind with which this country has ever been involved, and, if itsucceeds, holds out the prospect of bigger export earnings than forany item of equipment ever produced.    It is also one of those very few areas of advanced technology where Britain is several years ahead of the Americans and v/here the American competitor is running intoserious difficulties and greater delays that could give us a five-yearlead.g
20.      It has been generally agreed in the Government since 1964 that thedecision to go ahead with Concorde reached by the last Government was a mistake.    Looking back on it now none of us can regard it as having been an investment that could possibly justify itself in terms of economic returnset against the total costs that will have been incurred.    The Cabinet havewanted to cancel it from the outset but have felt unable to do so because ofour treaty obligations and the risk that were we to attempt it we would beopen to an action in the International Court which would stand a good chanceof success and would lead to our incurring the same order of expenditurewithout receiving any commensurate return from the export earnings ofthe aircraft,    For these reasons we have gone on for nearly four years.21.       In reassessing the project today the arguments for and against it have changed their character due to the passage of time, the expenditureof money, the technical progress and the delay in America in tire Boeing2707 programme.22.      If the technical problems are overcome, and costs contained,allowing the aircraft to be sold, the economics of the project now lookmore favourable, and hold out prospects of foreign exchange benefit of 470 million discounted (or  740 million gross) if 120 aircraft are sold;or up to  1,000 million gross with sales of 165.    If the BAC upperestimate of sales (250) were realised over a prolonged period foreign exchange earnings would rise to  1,450 million-gross.23.      It is therefore the technical and marketing aspects of Concordethat ought now to be decisive in our minds.    Here it is just not possibleto give a firm or clear answer/er at this moment,    I am not referring towhether the aircraft can actually fly or to whether it will fly safely.No other aircraft project has got so many safety elements built into it nor has been subjected to such a rigorous pre-flight testing programme.The technical problems are those connected with the payload and enginenoise.    There is also the sonic boom problem.    The extent to whichthese can be overcome will determine the market for the aircraft andwe cannot know the outcome until we have gained flight test experience.24,      There is therefore a very strong prima facie case for allowing the programme to continue until judgment of the technical viability of theaircraft can be based on flight-test results,25.      Against this must be set the case for cancellation, based upon thehigh total of public expenditure involved and the unavoidable uncertaintieswhich cannot be resolved until much more money has been spent.    But injudging this v/e have to take account of the binding nature of the treaty obligations from which we cannot readily escape.26,      Four courses of action are possible and I have set them out belowwith the arguments for and against briefly summarised.Course No. 1.    To continue with Concorde as an act of faith.The case for this is as follows:-(i) Sucess offers the possibility of foreign exchange benefits exceeding 1,000 million gross.
(ii) Success v/ould represent a great technological achievement for britain and Europe,(iii) Abandonment v/ould be a staggering blow to British engineeringat a time when it is making good progress in expanding its export markets,(iv) This is the policy of our partner France, and has been throughout,and we could not abrogate the treaty without serious risk offinancial and political damage.The case against:-(i)  There is no certainty that the project will succeed,(ii)   The present unsatisfactory nature of the unlimited financial commitment for the two Governments that this implies,I strongly recommend against this course as being an uncritical support for the Concorde programme.Course No. 2.    To decide firmly and finally to cancel now andannounce it immediately.    This is the course we sought to adopt in 1964.It was frustrated by our legal obligations.    The arguments for and againstare as followsThe case for:-It would stop expenditure and new commitments on the projectimmediately (apart from cancellation charges and possibledamages to the French).The case against:-(i) It v/ould remove the possibility of earning foreign exchange benefitsexceeding  1,000 million gross,(ii)  It would destroy the project and disrupt the great assembly of resources and skills devoted to it before they have had a chance to prove themselves, a few months before the four years of effort carried out under this Government have culminated inflight.(iii) It would do the maximum damage to our standing as an advancedindustrial society and our credibility as a partner in any inter-national project.(iv) It would expose us to the near certainty of damages in the Inter-national Court which, had we given no advance warning to theFrench whatsoever of our intentions, would put us at maximumrisk.(v)  These damages could involve nearly as much expenditure as the costs of continuing.For these reasons I cannot recommend this course,-7-
Course No. 3,    To decide now to cancel and to plan a strategy of withdrawl leading to cancellation at the end of the year.     This is thecourse of action which I understand the Chancellor to be recommending.The cases for and against can be summarised as follows:-The case for:-(i)  Provided the risk of damages to the French could be contained itwould put an upper limit on our commitment,(ii)  It might avoid the worst political and financial risks of animmediate confrontation with the French.(iii)  It would provide a strategy which would allow all Ministerialattention to be devoted to cancellation.The case against:-(i)  It would remove the possibility of earning foreign exchangebenefits exceeding  1, 000 million gross,(ii)  It would destroy the.project and disrupt the great assemblyof resources and skills devoted to it before they have hada chance to prove themselves, a few months before the fouryears of effort carried out under this Government haveculminated in flight.(iii) It would involve Ministers and officials in spending public money and in dealing with the French and with our own firms as thoughthe intention were to continue with the project, whilst in realitythey were working secretly towards its cancellation.    Thiswould make responsible management impossible, and our trueintentions would inevitably leak, to the disrepute of all concerned.(iv) There is no certainty at all that it would succeed.Course No. 4.    To talk to the French Government very franklyand seek their agreement to criteria which, if it later appeared likelywould not be achieved, would require the two Governments to considertogether whether to continue.    The two criteria that I discussed withthe Attorney-General and the Chief Secretary in preparation for mytalks with the French in May were:-(a) The acceptance of an upper limit to the commitment of the twoGovernments to extramural development expenditure.     Thefigure we would suggest would be within the range 550- 600 million at 1966 prices.(b) The placing of firm orders by four major airlines of which atleast one must be an American airline before the end of 1969.We should also establish that, failing agreement with the French on thesecriteria, or on whether they had been achieved, we would feel free todecide not to proceed ourselves if, in our judgment, the project was nolonger viable,f] AU J
We have begun this approach to the French by correspondence, but were unable to follow it up in discussion because.se the meeting arranged forthis purpose was postponed because of the trouble in France.The case for it is as follows:-(i) 3y keeping open the option of continuing it retains the possibilityof earning foreign exchange benefits exceeding  1,000 million gross.(ii) By opening up the possibility of establishing agreed criteria withthe French in relation to which continuation of the project is tobe judged by the two Governments, it secures all the benefits ofCourse No. 3.(iii) It avoids arbitrarily destroying the project and disrupting the greatassembly of resources and skills devoted to it before they havehad a chance to prove themselves a few months before the fouryears of effort carried out under this Government have culmina-ted in first flight.(iv) By providing a break-point for the United Kingdom it establishesbetter machinery for intergovernmental control (and thus increasesour bargaining power vis-a-vis the French);  it preservesresponsible management and avoids the serious disadvantagesfor Ministers and officials outlined under (iii) in the case againstCourse Not 3.The case against: -It requires us to risk up to an additional  75 million in order tosecure the possible but uncertain benefits and the time forcritical judgment.Recommendation27.      Having considered all these courses of action fully, I recommend to my colleagues that we adopt Course No, 4 which appears to me to bethe only practicable course actually open to us.    It gives all that theChancellor wishes to achieve in preparing the ground for a possiblecancellation while at the same time keeping open the possibility of continuing with the project and earning  1, 000 million gross in foreign exchange benefits.    There is little to choose in terms of public moneybetween this course and the course which the Chancellor recommends.But it is more realistic both in assessing the prospects of cancellationwithout damages and in providing for the possibility of technical and commercial success.    If this is agreed, I would propose to hold thepostponed meeting with M. Chamant as soon as possible, discuss the project with him on the lines indicated; propose the reconvening of the concorde Economic Prospects Committee to reappraise the situation and consider together the praticability and economy of reducing the rate ofexpenditure pending the resolution of some of the present technicaluncertainties.    I would then report back to Cabinet.A.W.B.Ministry of Technology, S.W.1,29th July, 1968
CDC. 24 of 7th June 1968REPORT TO BRITISH &amp; FRENCH ministers by THE CONCORDE DIRECTIIG COMMITTEE (CDC)At the last meeting at which they discussed Concorde, the British andFrench Ministers primarily responsible for the project had before them areport from the CDC (CDC.14 of 4th December 1967).   As a basis for the nextMinisterial discussion, arranged for 28th May 1966, the CDC submit this further report.TIMESCALE OF THE programme .   In their last report, the CDC indicated that a delay of some months inthe first flight date for the first prototype (then planned for 28th February1968) was possible.   On 23rd February, SDD and BAC submitted to officials a revised timetable for the whole programme which indicated that the firstflights for both prototypes were now planned for September/October 1968,and that initial certification of airworthiness was planned for October 1971(instead of June 1971).3.   The CDC believe that neither prototype will be ready for first flight bythe September/October date planned by the firms, that the earliest time bywhich either could be ready is October/November, and that January/February1969 is more likely.4.   The basic structure of the prototypes was completed more or less on time,and the CDC are satisfied that the setback is due mainly to delays in thesupply, and installation of systems and the test of equipment, includingflight test instrumentation.   The reasons for these delays are complex and theCDC does not feel able to apportion the responsibility among the various firmsinvolved.5.   The setback has had the following immediate adverse effects.(a) It will not be possible to check engine noise estimates againstactual measurements from Concordes in flight until the spring of 1969 at the earliest.   (Under the former programme thiswould have b&amp;en done during 1968).(b) There will be no practical experience of Concorde&apos;s sonic boombefore the autumn of I969 (under the former programme thiswould have been available during I968).(c) It will not be possible to demonstrate Concorde&apos;a qualities,including its supersonic performance, in actual flight, and to persuade airlines to place firm orders, until towards the endof 1969 (instead of by the spring of 1969)-    (The firms themselvesagree that they cannot now expeot to secure firm airline ordersbefore this time).1 -* * * * J we
BfflWAY LOADING20.   Further studies of this problem have indicated that it is still a cause for concern although less so than the problems of performance and noise.Concorde is in the same bracket in this respect as the DC8-63 and the Boeing747.    Both these   American aircraft are expected to be in worldwide service before Concorde, and at most of the airports of importance the authorities will thus have a strong inducement to make the necessary improvements.SELLING PRICE21.    The latest officials estimates indicate that if the manufacturers are tomake a profit on production and the Governments are to secure a modest recovery of their investment in development, the aircraft will have to be sold at anaverage unit price of not leas than $221.22.     In accordance with the wishes expressed by Ministers at their last meetingthe CDC have informed the firms that they do not wish them to quote a price inthe negotiation of further option^agreements without first consulting the CDC.The firms have accepted this.     However, the CDC think it unlikely that anyfurther option agreements will be negotiated until Concorde1s qualities havebeen demonstrated by flight trials.     By that time, the much more significantquestion   of what price should be sought in the firm contracts for sale willhave to be settled between the two Governments and the four firms.23.     The CDC have also considered, as directed by Ministers, the desirabilityof seeking to amend the figures for the purchase price given in existingoption agreements.     Although the figure quoted in some of the older agreementsia as low as $10 M (plus escalation), none of the agreements commit the manufacturers to sell at a specific price, and all the airlines know very well that they cannot expect to pay significantly less than the round figure of$20M which has been widely publicised.     The CDC believe that there is nothing to be gained from seeking to introduce an up-to-date figure for the selling price in existing option agreements.24.    The CDC will continue to study the related problems of production cost3and selling prices, with avvlew to making further recommendations to Ministers.SALES PROSPECTS25.    The CDC have little to add to what they said about sales prospects intheir last report (CDC.14 paras 24-26).     The number of reserved deliverypositions remains 74 (on behalf of 16 airlines) and no additions to these numbers are likely until the aircraft&apos;s qualities can be demonstrated by the flight of the prototypes.     Many of the option agreements lapse, and allow the customer a refund of his deposit, if by 31st December 1968 Air France andBOAC have not placed firm orders or the first prototype has not flown.     Inthese circumstances, a few airlines might prefer to give up their deliverypositions.26.     If the problems discussed above can be overcome sufficiently to giveConcorde a performance which is attractive to the airlines the assessment of its long term prospects must still take account of the progress of theBoeinj? 2707.     At the time of CDCs last report, the first flight date for- 5 -* * * / * t*
the first Boeing 2707 prototype was given as the end of 1970. Statements  published by the types and the Boeing Company on 22nd February 1968 indicated jthat the development programme was being slowed down so as to permit further 1design changes. The Boeing statement 3aid that &apos; the SST programme is not 1on a rigid schedule&apos; and no new first flight date has been given. But the I,indications are that it will not be before early 1972 and that the aircraft i will not go into service before 1975* There can be no doubt that Boeing [:have encountered substantial design difficulties, and further setbacks are 1not unlikely. Concorde1s 3 to 4 years lead over its American rival iscertainly not being eroded at present.PRODUCTION PROGRAMME27.     In their last report, the CDC indicated that the manufacturers had offered a choice of three production programmes.     The CDC have since asked the finns to base their long term planning on the first of these programmes, andhave asked for detailed proposals expressed in both physical and financial  Hterms.     This is the so-called &apos;slow9 programme, which would not enabledeliveries of aircraft beyond the 74 already reserved to be offered untiltowards the end of 1974*     Given current uncertainties about Concorde&apos;sprospects, the CDC do not think it prudent to embark on a faster programme now,and moreover they believe that at least for the next twelve months or so the planned build-up of commitments on production should be slowed down.Nevertheless, the CDC considers a case may emerge for incurring some expenditure!which would enable the manufacturers to revert quickly to a faster programmeif by, say, the middle of 1969 the sales prospects were such as to justifysuch a course, and the CDC have accordingly asked the firms to submit proposals to this end.FINANCING PRODUCTION28.     The initial stages of the production programme continue to be financedjon both sides of the Channel under interim arrangements.     On the British side,the Industrial Expansion Bill, which includes provision for the long term    Hfinancing of Concorde production, has now been approved by the H0use ofCommons and is expected to be enacted by the end of the current parliamentary session.     On the French side, the loans provided by the Treasury will have beellused up by this summer, and it will therefore be necessary to establish long-ffterm arrangements by then.     British and French officials are seeking toharmonise their procedures for financing the programme in the long term.Lmm6 -

Relatively little money has yet beenirrevocably committed to production, but overthe next 18 months the British Government1scommitments are likely to rise as followsby 31st December 1968by 30th June        1969by 31st December 1969Provided Concorde is a technical and commercialsuccess, these sums would be wholly recovered.If the project were cancelled, they would haveto be written off.Recovery of development expenditure through receipts from levies10.      The following calculations are based on the following assurop-tions.aircraft(a) Aircraft are sold at a price averaging.  9.5 M over 100/-and this is sufficient to recover the Costs ofproduction plus levies for the recovery ofdevelopment expenditure at the following rates.First 50 aircraft 4$51st to 100th aircraft      5-9$101st aircraft onwards      10$(b) Over the operational life of the aircraft,receipts from sales of spares (including spareengines) will equal 65$ of the receipts from/sales of aircraft
sales of aircraft, and the price of spareswill include development levy at lCffo.(c)   The levies are shared equally between theBritish and French&apos;Governments.On these assumptions, receipts from levies, to be set againstthe uncommitted development expenditure of  110-230 M described in paragraph 6 would be as follows70 aircraft sold  33 M120        11 &quot;  69 M165        &quot; &quot;  101 If.Balance ofrayments benefits11.      The following calculations are based on the assumptionslisted in paragraph 10, with the following additional assumptions.(a) In calculating the foreign exchange benefit,7js$ should be deducted from the total receipts from sales on account of the third countryimport content (mainly American equipment in theaircraft) in the costs of production.(b) 45$ of the total receipts from sales (and of the costs of production) will accrue to the U.K.(As a result of devaluation, we can no longerreckon our share to be 50$).(c) Sales to BOAC (which would be a small, part of thetotal anyway) may be regarded as import savings.On these assumptions, the following benefits would accrue tothe U.K. balance of payments.70 aircraft sold  433 M120      &quot; &quot;  740 M165      &quot; &quot;  1019 MAppraisals of the economic consequences of continuin/t with the project/l2.

12.      The remainder of this Annex consists of appraisals of theeconomic consequences of continuing with the project,   usingtwo methods - the implied subsidy approach, and the impliedpreferance approach.   In all cases, expenditures up to 31stDecember are ignored.Implied subsidy13.      In the following calculations, the balance of paymentsbenefits described in paragraph 11 are compared with the differencebetween the Government&apos;8 uncommitted expenditure on development( 110-230 M) and its receipts from levies (as described in paragraph10), the ratio between the two being regarded as an impliedsubsidy for foreign exchange.   In each case the lower percentagerelates to the lower estimate of development expenditure (i.e. the basic total estimate of  600 M described in paragraph l) and thehigher percentage to the higher estimate of  780 M which includescontingencies.   All expenditures and receipts are discounted at&amp;fo per annum to 31st December 1968.Number of aircraft sold7.0 120 165 M                  M  Mdiscounted discounted discounted(a) Foreign exchangebenefit                                 298                470 608(b) Uncommitted development expenditure 85 - 177 85 - 177        85 - 177(c) Receipts from levies 17^- 42 58^-(d) Difference between (b)and (c) - i.e. theGovernment&apos;a loss 67^- - 160 43 - 135        26  - 118 (e) Implied subsidy i.e.(d) as a percentage of fo tfo $(a) 22  - 54 9   - 29 Ah - 19iImplied preference14.      An alternative method of appraising the economic consequences of continuing the project is to compare the foreign exchange benefitswith the national resources that will be used to secure these benefits
(i.e. the) resources used to complete the development programme and to manufacture the aircraft and spares to be sold).   Sincedevelopment is being paid for by the Government, and it is assumed that the costs of production (however they may be met initially)will be wholly recovered from sales, this method gives very similarresults to those from the &apos;implied subsidy&apos; method described inthe preceding paragraph.   The results are as follows.

ANNEX CESTIMATION OF FIRST PLIGHT date for a complex aeroplane such as Concorde one hasto distinguish between two distinct phases in evaluatingthe programme of construction and more specifically thedate of first flight: these phases are the designconstruction and testing of the airframe - fuselage,wings, tail - and the corresponding stages for equipment including in this category the engine.2.     The airframe although technologically advancedeven by aircraft standards is manufactured and assembledby processes that are well-established.     The planning of the work is directly under the control of the maincontractors who are able to switch effort as they seefit to meet impending crises.3.     In order to be cleared for flight the airframe hasto undergo a vibration test.    This is a complexinvestigation lasting 3 or 4 weeks but with moderndesign techniques one would not expect it to revealanything untoward.     The vibration tests on Concordewere completed in September 1967: they were conducted in an exemplary fashion and they confirmed almost exactly the design calculations.   At this time therefore the airframe was cleared for flight to the schedulelaid down some three years previously.4.     The situation on equipment is altogether different?there are 1050 items of equipment* each of which has its own test schedule to complete before it can beregarded as flightworthy.     The degree of difficultyassociated with these varies widely; some areextrapolations of existing items others have had tobe designed from scratch to meet the particularlyexacting standards of supersonic flight.5.     From the beginning of the Concorde project theFrench and ourselves have insisted upon standards of safety even for first flight that are more severe than for any past civil aeroplane.     The attached schedulegives some idea of the hurdles to be cleared beforefirst flight.   It is important to understand that anendurance test lasting 1,000 hours say will coverconditions more arduous than the equipment will meet in normal service and it must be completed withoutfailure.   If a failure occurs at say 900 hours the equipment may have to be stripped, modified and thewhole test repeated.*   580 under BAC control, 470 under SUD control.There are many hundreds of other items of equipment from nuts and bolts upwards that have to meet general-aircraft rather than specific-to-Concorde standards./6.    Overlying ..
6.     Overlying the clearance problem is the fact thatequipments and their associated systems react stronglyone upon the other: for example, the fuel system has alarge Content of electrical equipment.     If there aredelays in clearing the electrical system the fuel systemtests will remain uncompleted.   Equally if the electricalsystem shows a fault on test the resulting modificationsmay require modifications to the fuel system.7.     The nett result is that while the airframe operationhas its element of crisis it can be planned in the officewhereas the equipment - or more correctly systems - isa battle fought on the shop floor and in the test housewith the risk of compound delays owing to failures thatto the layman would seem insignificant*.8.     The effect of these difficulties in estimating firstflight date is clears to take an over-simplified example,if all major equipments had to undergo 1000 hours ofendurance testing one could have completed 800 hourssuccessfully and have the whole planning set awryto the extent of several months delay on the last 200.9.     Thus the business of estimating flight dates turnsupon a judgement of the degree of risk involved in theprogramme remaining and the repercussions of failure.Firms and officials alike will always estimate a timedelay several times that needed to complete the testsand instal the equipment.       Firms are invariably moreoptimistic than officials if for no other reason thanthat they are deliberately setting stiff targets tokeep their own people and their subcontractors up toscratch.*   After several hundred hours of endurance testingsome of the powered flying control units developedoil leaks hardly visible to the eye? they had tobe stripped and the whole operation started againfrom the beginning.
