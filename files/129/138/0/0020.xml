[DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY-^ GOVERNMENT)A NATIONAL HYDROCARBONS corporation memorandum by the Minister of power the recently published report of the Labour Party Fuel study group, making detailed proposals for setting up a National HydrocarbonsCorporation, may be discussed at this year&apos;s Party Conference and we ought to decide what line any Government speaker should take.2.       The previous report published a year ago recommended that aNational Hydrocarbons Corporation should be set up with the main objectof bringing a substantial part of future operations in the North Sea intothe public sector, without interfering with existing private interests.This proposal was at no time considered by Ministers collectively andwe have never taken a view on its merits,    I understand that the presentMinister of Transport, who was at the time Minister of Power thought it,and the ideas underlying it, needed consideration but that the Governmentshould certainly not become committed to the proposal at last yearTsConference and without much fuller examination.    The National ExecutiveCommittee, however, presented a statement endorsing the proposals in broad outline, which the 1967 Conference approved.    The Study Groupwas reconstituted to examine certain issues in greater detail.    Thepresent report deals with the organisation and financing of the NationalHydrocarbons Corporation and its relations with the Gas Council.    TheGroup propose to consider in a subsequent report the longer termimplications for the domestic oil industry and the international potential of the Corporation.3.      Vi/natever we eventually decide about the broad concept of aNational Hydrocarbons Corporation, I have most serious misgivings aboutthe detailed proposals in the present report, mainly because of the effectthey would have on our announced plans for the gas industry and the exploitation of natural gas.    The Study Group proposes that responsibilityfor bulk transmission and storage of natural gas and for its sale in bulkto the Area Gas Boards and large consumers would be transferred fromthe Gas Council to the Corporation.    This would be wholly inconsistent with Government policy for the future structure of the gas industry.    Tobring natural gas rapidly and efficiently into use firm central policycontrol over all aspects of the strategy of absorption from the beach tothe consumer is essential.

CO NFS DENTS AL&apos;w*and distribution of gas must all be subject to one centrally determinedstrategy and policy direction whether actually carried out by the area boards or the Gas Council.    It has already been agreed by the ministerial committee on Industrial Policy that this central control should be exercised by the Gas Council and my predecessor informed Parliament (on22nd May this year) that early legislation to achieve this objective was proposed.4.       The Study GroupTs proposals would take us in the opposite-   -direction.    Responsibility for on-shore operations would be divided andI do not see how we could secure an effective unified strategy;  therewould be risk of wasteful duplication of the transmission and supplysystem and the marketing effect would be fragmented.    Par fromcontributing to the rapid and efficient exploitation of natural gas, the study Group!s proposals would impede it.    I made these points toGeorge Brown in a letter before the report was published but apparentlywith no effect.5.       There remain the functions foreseen for the Corporation in theNorth Sea, and any other proposals that may emerge from the GroupTsfurther studies - which could have implications for the Governments oiland fuel policies.    Only the North Sea activities are dealt with in thepresent report.    The Study Group^s prospectus is, in my view, over-optimistic particularly in respect of acreage to be released by existinglicence holders.    It does not pay sufficient regard to the risks associatedwith a venture of this kind, the heavy calls on capital and the technical problems of entering into this highly specialised field.    There are anumber of ways of securing a greater public stake in the North Sea withoutestablishing a new public body.    One possibility to examine would be to change the licence terms for any future concessions with the object ofsecuring increased revenue for the Exchequer from any gas or oil foundin them, while leaving all the risks with the private sector.    Anotheralternative would be to give a more prominent role to the Gas Council,which already has some experience of North Sea operations;  this mightbe done without the need for legislation.    I do not find the GroupTsarguments against this course at all convincing, though I appreciate thatit may not appear so attractive politically.6..       I have arranged for my officials to study these issues in greaterdepth, in consultation with other Departments.    There Is no need to reach an immediate decision.    The first areas to be surrendered will not revert to the Government until near the end of 1970 and any legislation neededcould be put through in the 1969&quot;70 Session.    I suggest therefore that theright course would be to take a non-committal line at the Conference and do no more than promise to study the report, perhaps sounding a warning that we see serious objection to any diminution of the Gas CouncilJsresponsibility for implementing the Governments strategy for natural gasabsorption.    This would have the disadvantage that Conference might reach a decision which we subsequently decided not to act on.    But it would allowmore time for consideration of the Study GroupTs proposals, and would avoid giving the impression that we had made up our minds before hearingwhat Conference had to say,R.M,Ministry of Power, S.
