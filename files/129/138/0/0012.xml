jgDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY1,? GOVERNMENT)UNITED KINGDOM/UNITED STATES ADVANCED LIFTENGINE programme memorandum by the Minister of TechnologyAt the meeting of the Steering Committee on Economic Policy heldon 22nd July I v/as invited to submit to the Cabinet the question of futuresupport for the XJ 99 advanced lift engine.    I am therefore circulatingthis paper so that my colleagues may be aware of the present position onthis engine and of the reasons why I believe we should continue to supportit on the reduced scale to which the Committee gave its provisional agreement.2,       This is a joint programme with the United States intended to becarried out in three phases.    The technical content of the work is divided equally between the two countries and is being carried out byRolls-Royce and the Allison Division of General Motors.    each government is responsible for the cost of work done in its own country;because otir costs are lower than the American, the United Kingdom shareof expenditure is assessed at about 30 per cent of the whole.    Rolls-Royceare making a financial contribution of  1 million to Phases I and II and areprepared to subscribe 20 per cent of the total United Kingdom share if theprogramme goes through to completion.Progress to date.       The programme began in March, 1966 with no firm application inview but with the object of developing and proving an advanced technologyengine suitable for installation in a VTQJL production aircraft.    It was hoped that the first application would be the fighter aircraft (AVS) thenprojected as a joint venture by the United States and the Federal republic of Germany.    The total cost of developing the XJ99 was provisionallyestimated at 100 million dollars and the United Kingdom share at 10 million to  15 million including the Rolls-Royce contribution.    Thepresent position is that we and the Americans are committed to a programme for Phase I lasting until end-May, 1969.    The United kingdom share of this phase is  3,4 million including a Rolls-Royce contribution of about  0.65 million.    Of this nearly  2 million has already been spent.C(68) 92COPY NO.29th July, 1968CABINET-1-
07rZ U 0Possible Applications4.       The AVS aircraft was cancelled at the beginning of this year sothere is no definite application in view at present.    There are, however,a number of possible outlets either for the complete engine or for the newtechnology it contains.    These are as follows(a) As a direct lift engineAn American and/or another Western military requirementmay again emerge.    Two German research aircraft are alreadyfitted with an existing Pv.nicholls-Royce lift engine, the RB 162.(b) as a boosterThis seems the most promising outlet at the moment since thereare already over 1, 000 booster engines of various types in service and the market is growing.    For example, Rolls-Royceand Allison have already received a number of enquiries fromBoeing about the XJ99 for use on various aircraft such as the727, 737, 747 and 755.    British European Airways haveordered RB 162 booster engines for their new Trident 3Bprogramme and these could be replaced in due course if so desired with the XJ99 giving a 50 per cent increase in thrust.(c) adapted as a, large fan engine of a type liKely to be required forany inter-city VTOL transport aircraft coming into service inthe second half of the 1970s.Proposed Future programme.      When the AVS project was cancelled we reviewed the programme with the United States Government and we concluded that Phases II and iii of the programme should be put on one side for the moment.    At the samewe agreed to slow down the rate of expenditure on Phase I which had theeffect of moving the completion date from end-October, 1968 to end-May, 1969.    We also undertook to consider what further work shouldbe carried out after that date.6.      Following a recent visit by the Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff,United States Air Force, we are now in sight of agreement with theUnited States Government on a programme extension of 11 months to end-April, 1970 at an additional cost to the United Kingdom of  2.1 million to which Rolls-Royce would contribute about  350, 000.    The  3.4 millionprogrammes to end-May, 1969 to v/hich both countries are already committed will do little more than prove the technical feasibility of an advanced lift engine of this type.    If we are to breed confidence In the design and in the new technology embodied in the engine, then we must dosome more work and complete the programme with a special TechnologyDemonstration Test to prove performance and mechanical integrity.    Thiswill enable tire companies to go out and sell the concept to potentialcustomers on a firm basis and to make use of the new technology in otherengine designs without incurring a serious technical risk.-2-

Costs7.       A programme on these lines would cost substantially less than that envisaged before the AVS aircraft was cancelled and would give thefollowing result in terms of savings to the United Kingdom Exchequer.  M.1968-69     1969-701970-71      1971-72      1972-731968 PESCSurvey1.72. 52. 00. 7Proposed newProgrammeSaving1.40.31. 21.20.52. 00. 151. 850. 150. 55It will be seen, therefore, that the proposed new programme would savehalf of the expenditure previously planned for 1969-70, and a great deal more than half in subsequent years.Other Factors8.      There are two other relevant factors.    First, it is important tomaintain and not to disrupt the present developing relationship betweenRolls-Royce and Allison.    They are already in association on an order,worth 100 million dollars to the United Kingdom, for developing andsupplying 500 Spey engines for the United States Air Force Corsairprogramme and within the last few days have obtained, in conjunctionwith Allison, a contract for a rather different version of this engine forthe United States Navy.    This may well lead to an even more valuableproduction contract.    If we can build up the Rolls/Allison association, itwill increase our chances of penetrating the United States market stillfurther.    Second, it is important to maintain the present position of rolls-Royce in the forefront of direct lift engine technology so that theycan exploit it as the market emerges.    It would greatly undermineRolls-Royce;s position if the United States went on alone.conclusion.      For all these reasons I invite the Cabinet to agree that theUnited States/United Kingdom advanced lift engine programme shouldcontinue, but on the reduced scale proposed until end-april^ 1970 at a totalcost to the United Kingdom of  5. 5 million, to which Rolls-Royce would contribute  1 million, in place of the present programme provided inPESC which would cost the Exchequer  10.4 million up to 1972-73 and 1.1 million thereafter.    The total saving would be  7.0 million of which 5. 9 million would be saved in the period up to 1972-73.A.W.B.Ministry of Technology, S.W.1,29 th July, 1968-3-
