W. Bm\Ministry of Technology, S. &quot;W. 1.29th July, 1968
APP3NLIXCONSEQUENCES OF CANCELLATION OF VARIOUS AIRCRAFT PROJECTSi.    At its meeting on 25th April, the Committee invited us, in consultationwith the Department of Economic Affairs, to prepare a paper examining the viability of the aircraft industry if certain major projects were cancelled,and the alternative uses of resources engaged in the industry.     We have been pressed to complete the paper urgently, and have not been able to clear it with DEA, but we think it unlikely that there will be disagreement on thefacts.2.     The projects which we have taken are Concorde, Airbus and the advancedmilitary aircraft.     These are in fact the three projects upon which thetechnically advanced element in the aircraft industry&apos;s programme over thenext decade is likely to depend most critically.    The only other advancedproject in sight is   the EB 211 engine.     It is shown in Annex A that thethree projects will in the mid-1970&apos;s occupy about one-third of the labour force of the industry.     The cancellation of these projects would greatlyreduce the size of the industry and its contribution to the national economy;and also strike critically at the advanced design capability, leaving theindustry with no advanced airframe projects at all.Alternative Use of Resources3.     The &quot;alternative use of resources&quot; side of the Committee&apos;s remit is theeasier to assess.     Cancellation of the three projects in the near future wouldinvolve immediate redundancies of some 14,000, mostly due to Concorde, and unless these projects could be replaced the potential work for a further50,000 men would be lost, and these would become redundant as the aircraftwork ran down.     Except within the Rolls Royce group, there would be no possibility of absorbing redundancy within the industry.K*     The industry is of a higher standard of labour force than the national average, both professionally and in terms of skills.     It has a high proportion of qualified scientists and engineers^ and is of greatimportance over a wide range of technologies.5.    The industry is concentrated in the South-East, the Midlands andSouth Lancashire, and there is no reason to suppose that there would bemuch difficulty in absorbing the semi-skilled and unskilled workers,provided that industry generally was expanding.     The labour turnoveris about 16$ a year.     It is likely also that the skilled workers would be absorbed in the high-performance engineering industries which are growingin these areas.     The studies of the redundancies following the cancellation of TSR2, attached in Annex C, suggest that these problemsshould not be serious.1.
The professional engineers might well present a greater problem.     Thenumbers in the aircraft industry are not large in relation to the total numberof qualified scientists and engineers in the country - some 2.3?^ of the total;and the numbers in the country are growing fast and are being absorbed withoutany major impact on the shortage situation.     So there should be little difficulty in finding them employment, particularly in the expanding advancedparts of the engineering industry.   On the other hand, many of the skills andall the experience is special to the aircraft industry, and is not directlyapplicable elsewhere;    and many would no doubt go to work in the aircraft industry abroad,.     The impact upon our technological standing would workagainst us.7,    The capital facilities are not in general readily transferable.     Windtunnels, structural test facilities, simulators, and much of the specialisedproduction machinery could not be applied in other fields.     The buildings are normally too tall for ordinary manufacturing purposes, involving highheating and maintenance cost,,     The redeployment of the labour would be much easier than the losses on the capital equipments8,    But although it is not likely that the redeployment of the labour force would present fundamental difficulties, we must emphasise that what wouldreally be happening would be the breakdown of the great national assetsrepresented by the big aircraft undertakings - the combined strength of management, design teams, engineers, salesmen, skilled workers, and the wholeof their factories and capital equipment and labour force and. organisation,integrated capabilities which have been built up over fifty years.     It maybe possible for such organisations to disintegrate and for the individuals in them to integrate themselves and their work into other businesses.     Butit is a process which is bound to involve great loss.     How serious it becomes is a matter of degree.     But unquestionably it would become veryserious indeed if all three of the projects were stopped without any earlyprospect of new ones taking their place.The Viability of the industry.    The problem is seen most acutely in the ability of the industry toproduce, either itself or in combination with other countries, a wide range of civil and military aircraft,   which will be competitive in world markets and so be able to provide the needs of the RAF and of the civil airlinesat the same time talcing advantage of the rapidly expansing world market..This depends on the capability of the industry in every sense, which would be bound to be critically weakened by a further series of cancellations.     Butit is particularly sensitive to the problem of design.10,   The analysis of the industry&apos;s programme (including these three projects)in AI0(68)2 showed a substantial djcrease in R &amp; D activity in the 1970&apos;with a corresponding reduction in the numbers of design staff.     We expect areduction in the number of design teams at work in the two main airframecompanies to probably four - one military combat aircraft team, one subsoniccivil team, one supersonic civil team and the equivalent of one further teamon miscellaneous work.     So vre start from a position in which the designbase is narrowing.     The loss of the three projects would destroy the basisof three of these remaining teams, unless new projects were developed toreplace them.     The damage would be cumulative in its effect.     The lossof the advanced military combat aircraft would weaken the capability of theteams engaged on civil aircraft, etc.11.   Of course it might be possible for the aircraft industry to retainprofitable business by producing small aircraft and by doing sub-contractingwork, without any significant advanced design capability.     But it must be emphasised that the big prospects in the civil aviation world market are the bigger aircraft.     In Annex D we set out some possible lay-outs of theworld market, by size and type, up to 1985:    the calculation is bound to bespeculative, but it seems most unlikely that the market for aircraft with2o
capacities of 150 seats or less will be more than 25$ of the total.     If wecan keep in the airbus range of sizes, we can be competing for some 60$ of theworld demand.     In order to take advantage of the big world market for civilaviation, we have to be in the larger ranges of aircraft, either ourselvesor in combination with others.     Without this, the potential aeronauticalexports outlined in AI0(68)7 would be reduced by at least a half, and theinport bill much increased,unilateral12.   Again, all the three projects are European projects.     The/cancellation(or failure to go ahead) of each of them would have great repercussions upon our future ability to persuade European G-governments and aircraft industries to collaborate with us in future projects, the relevance of which is brought out very clearly in the preceding paragraph.     The size and nature of the repercussions would depend upon the circumstances of each particularcancellation.     Apart from the purely aircraft industry aspects, there aregreat implications for our reputation as a reliable partner and for our ability to conduct any kind of programme of European co-operation not onlyin the technological field but throughout our policies,13,   The facts relating to the three individual projects are set out in annex E.     In each of them is the issue of the loss of design capability,the loss of an effective industrial unit, the blow to our European policy,the combined effect of these upon our ability to take advantage of the growing world market for civil aviation and the still very large world market for military aircraft.     The difficulty Is that the future of theindustry and of the major units in it is tied to the success of a small number of very large projects.     It is this that makes the decision-makingdifficulty, for each particular decision has an effect on the totalcapability of a major importance;   and so these wider problems have to comeinto the discussion of each of the individual projects, and they cannotreally be regarded as self-sufficient cases to be judged by themselves.3.

Annex. CAIRCRAFT INDUSTRY REDUNDANCY STUDYIntroductionIn 1965 three major aircraft projects were cancelled - theT.S.R.2, H.S. 681 and the P. 115k.    In the autumn of 1967interviews were carried out on behalf.of Government Social Surveywith a sample of those declared redundant in three of the maincentres affected - Coventry, Preston and Bristol.    The objectof the exercise,, which was preceded by discussions with the firms&apos; managers responsible for handling the redundancies, was toexamine two questions.   First the nature of the redeploymentof the manpower resources achieved.    Secondly the process bywhich the redeployment was achieved.    This note will give a first impression of some of the findings relating to some aspectsof the first question only.    It must be stressed that a greatdeal of analysis of the results remains to be done but theprovisional summary which follows may be of interest to thosecurrently reviewing the Aircraft Industry.JJLs.. The Survey2.     The nominal rolls and last known addresses of thosedeclared redundant were made available by the firms.   A one ineight sample was drawn from this list giving 881 names.    17 ofthese were subsequently rejected for various reasons, e.g. theywere never made redundant, the address provided was abroad,they had been interviewed in the pilot survey or they appearedtwice.    There were thus 86k effective addresses which ledto 621 final interviews i.e. a 72 per cent response rate. 172interviews were with those declared redundant from Preston, 293with those from Coventry and 156 from Bristol.    These representedresponse rates of 70 per cent 76 per cent and 67 per cent respectively.    The 72 per cent traced and interviewed over twoyears after redundancy would tend to contain a higher proportionof older immobile workers than the population as a whole andthis should be borne in mind in interpreting the information in the following sections.3.     It should also be borne in mind that the informationwhile not confined to those registering at Employment Exchangesrelates only to those actually declared redundant and not tothose who changed jobs in anticipation of redundancy.1,11Emi grationk.     Much interest has surrounded the question of emigrationfollovri-ng redundancy.   A survey of the kind undertaken, basedon interviews and tracing people from their last known address,can throw only a little light on the question.    However thereports from those trying to trace people record 3.5 per cent of the full sample (86k) as having been reported to haveemigrated and a further 7.3 per cent to have moved without trace.No details exist on the occupations of these groups.IV. Other withdrawals from the labour force5.     18 per cent of those interviewed (621) did not takeanother job after they were declared redundant.   As Table 1shows the majority were men near, or over, retirement age, and
otwouldthus have left the labour force within a relatively short period, irrespective of being declared redundant.Table I Age and sax of those not taking another job	Percent of grand total			Sex	Aged 5h or under	Aged 8.0	Aged 65 and over	TotalWomen	12.5		0	20.5Men	10.7	33-0	35.7	79-5Total	23.2 *	41.6	-------	Too&quot;.o&quot;&quot;&quot;(Base for percentages - 112)6.     14-2 per cent of those who did not take  mother job werein Administrative, Technical and Clerical^ occupations,31 per cent (all men) in skilled occupations and the remainderin semi skilled or unskilled occupations.V.......Jobs taken by redundant workers7.     72 per cent of those who took another job found their firstemployment in some sector of manufacturing industry, 11 per centin public utilities and construction and 17 per cent in services.Table 2 shows the broad details,and also shows that thepercentage going into service industries was much lower amongthe skilled and the &quot;engineers&quot;*JLable .2Redundant workers industry of first employment, by occupationi           i   -1 .ccupcTfc i on	per cent obtaining first job in			Total number (i.e. base for is)	manufacturing industry	public utilities and construction	services	pistrativo, laical &amp; clerical	69	7	24	180pineers&quot; included pre	84	3	13	38filed	79	12	9	233[i skilled	64	13	24	55Piled	56	15	28	3911	72	11	17	507occupational classification used in the study is built up from the4ps identified in the Department of Employment and Productivity&apos; s;3e.l survey of occupations in Mahufacturing Industry (Gazette Jan. 1968)^ughout the annex where separate figures are shown for &quot;Engineers&quot; theyto. to Design, Development, Planning, Estimating, Production,Section and Maintenance Engineers and other qualified technicians.^exclude Draughtsmen, technical assistants and supporting clerical:?,ff, -
K-    More detailed figures show that 13 per cent of all those gettingI$other job found it in the&quot;&apos;aircraft industry.   The proportion was between a quarter and a third among the senior administrators andI &quot;Sigineers&quot;.   Among the skilled and unskilled much the most popularI single industry was motor vehicles which absorbed 27 per cent ofI all the skilled men including 34 per cent of all the skilled fitters.15,    The proportion actually obtaining jobs in the aircraft industry i(13 per cent) is very much smaller than the 47 per cent who started by trying to limit their search to the aircraft industry.   a desire to remain in the aircraft industry was reported by a high1 proportion of those in skilled occupations e.g. 70 per cent ofI skilled, machine tool workers and 60 per cent of fitters and of1 ohargehands and foremen, and by the Engineers&quot; (56 per cent).    ThisI suggests that a high proportion of those declared redundant thought; their skills and experience would be of greater value to them inthe aircraft industry then elsewhere.I fl,   EfAec^^ji^e^aj^iin^110,   The aircraft industry has traditionally been a high earningssector and 61 per cent of those who obtained a new job were notable to earn as much in their first post-redundancy job as in theaircraft job they left.    The proportion earning less was highestaaong the skilled workers (68 per cent) and lowest among theadministrative technical and clerical (51 per cent).    30 per cent ofthe total reported increases in earnings,with the administrativetechnical and clerical groups again doing better than average.    Thedecreases reported tended to be much larger than increases and even after allowing for poor reporting the total earnings in postredundancy jobs were considerably lower than those of the sameworkers in the aircraft industry^.HI.   Time not working11.    39 per cent of those who obtained another job did so within aweek of stopping work as a result of redundancy.    The proportionwas highest among the unskilled (45 per cent) semi-skilled(47 per cent), draughtsmen (61 per cent) and skilled plumbers,welders, sheet metal workers etc.  (53 per cent).12.    15 per cent took 3 months or more with the highest proportionsin particular occupations being among foreman and charge hands(30 per cent), and Engineers&quot; (23 per cent).    The broad picture isshown in Table 3.13.    Figures for men only in the three centres in which theredundancies occurred suggest considerable variation in the time of finding a new job.    In Bristol over 60 per cent were at work withina week, at Coventry 33 per cent and in Preston 30 per cent.    Therewas less variation among those who were not at work for 3 months or more.    The range being from 10 per cent in Preston to 20 per centin Coventry.   These variations are not what one might expect giventhe labour market situation in the three areas but more detailedanalyses whould show whether the explanation is in the type ofworkers released, or in the way the redundancy was handled in thedifferent centres.* &quot;These findings should not be taken as evidence that these workers had a higher marginal product in the aircraft industry than afterredeployment.    In addition to the usual difficulties of usingearnings as a measure of marginal productivity comparisons involving the aircraft industry give rise to special problems.    First theindustry is heavily subsidised, and secondly complications occurbecause the indivisible units of production are very large.

Annex EEffects of Cancellation of Individual ProjectsConcorde1.     Concorde is the most advanced civil aircraft project in being in theworld, and it is the largest industrial investment this country has evermade.    It is 5 years ahead of the American S.S.T., and is the one majoradvanced technological project in which European applied technology isdemonstrably ahead of the American,,   To see Concorde flying on the air routes of the world years before any American S.S.T., would be a greatboost for British and European technology and for national self-confidence.2.     Concorde currently accounts for about 13,000 jobs in the UK.About 6,500 are with BAC (out of that Company&apos;s total pay roll of 30,000on aircraft work) 3,500 with the Bristol Engine Division of Rolls Royce(out of a total pay roll for the Rolls Royce Group of 73,000), and about,000 with equipment firms.   Geographically, the heaviest concentration(7,800) is in Bristol (4,300 out of the 7,300 BAC employees there and3,500 out of the 14,500 Bristol Engine employees).   As the table at annex A shows, and as the production of Concorde gets into full swing,these numbers will increase steadily to reach a peak of about 30,000 inthe early 1970&apos;s in the two main firms with thousands more in equipmentfirms.3.     The British share in the development and production of the Concordeairframe is being undertaken by BAC Filton, with a small part of thework detached to Weybridge.   The Concorde is Filton&apos;s only major project and, if it were to be cancelled, BAC would almost certainly close downFilton and concentrate the remaining work (subcontracted from other divisions) on their Weybridge factory thereby reducing the 2,000redundancies that would otherwise occur there.   The closure of Filtonwould mean the disappearance of an advanced industrial unit (managementengineers, skilled workers, specialised capital facilities) built up over50 years, at present working together on this tremendous national (and international) project.4.     The engine for Concorde, the Olympus 593, is being developed atPatchway, Bristol.    It is the only civil supersonic engine underdevelopment in the UK.   The other major engine being developed by the bristol Engine Division at present is the Pegasus engine for themilitary Harrier.   Work on this and a number of more minor projectscould keep the Patchway Plant development team alive, but the cancellation-tion of the Olympus 593 would reduce the unit appreciably in size,importance and technical ability and would be a serious loss to the combined Rolls Royce/BSE.5.     The size and severity of the cut back on the production side would be alleviated to the extent that Rolls Royce chose and were ableto transfer work to Bristol from their many outside sub-contractors.As the new engine programmes go ahead the Derby and satellite plantsof Rolls Royce, which are already short of skilled labour, will be increasingly stretched and in the next few years there should be scope for transferring production work to Bristol;   we would expect theCompany to do this as far as possible.   Nevertheless, work of this kindcannot be shifted or generated overnight and cancellation of theOlympus 593 would certainly give rise to an immediate loss in excessof 3,000.1
6.     In addition to the airframe and the engine, 3,000 workers are involvedon the development and manufacture of equipment for the Concorde in the UK.In all, over 40 major firms in this country, including Elliotts, had,Ferranti, Ultra and the Dowty Croup, are involved to a greater or lesser extent.   The wide geographical spread of this employment is shown in the map at Annex B.   The concentration in any particular area is notparticularly high, but here again the main cause for concern would bethe loss to the companies of advanced technological work and the effectthat this could have on their ability and will to remain in the frontline of technological advance.7.     The cancellation of Concorde for valid technical reasons in agreementwith the French would be a major failure for European technology.   but its unilateral cancellation for other reasons would have the most serious repercussions   on the whole industry (airframe, engine and equipment) andon our standing in Europe, and our reputation as a reliable partner.   the cancellation would inflict a damaging blow to morale and confidence in theindustry;    and the impact would be felt throughout the advancedtechnological industries in the UK.Airbus8.   The market studies that have been done, and all that has happenedboth here and in America since the original decision to embark on the airbus was taken, confirm the view that the concept is right and thatthe world market in aircraft of this size will be large.   If the Airbusproject can be made into an economic one, its prospects will certainly be very good.   The practical effect of cancelling the Airbus might wellbe withdrawal by the UK from the development and production of mediumrange large subsonic aircraft with their export earning and import saving potential, with repercussions upon its aeroengine capability.In this as in Concorde, the effect upon our European partners of cancellation unilaterally before it is clear that no economic projectcould be framed would be highly damaging.9.     Current employment on airframe design is at the moment almostentirely concentrated on the Hatfield factory of HSA, and the RB207engine is being designed in the Derby factories of Rolls Royce.The total number of jobs which the project is sustaining at presentin these two areas amounts to about 1,000.  If the aircraft goes aheadinto development and production, employment will rise to a plateau ofabout &apos;20,000 by 1973.   At this early stage in the project, it is notpossible to forecast with any certainty the likely geographical distribution of the production work.   The manufacture of the UK shareof the airframe would almost certainly be centred upon Hatfield but it is unlikely that the area would be able to meet the peak labour demandsof the early 1970&quot;s.    It is likely, therefore, that a reasonableproportion of the work would be distributed amongst the otherfactories of HSA, such as Brough, Ramble, Chester, all of which may befacing work shortages in that period.   Without the production work whichthe project would involve or work on a similar project, HSA would face considerable contraction and plant closure in the early 1970&apos;s.Moreover, unless the project was replaced there would be &quot;insufficientwork to sustain the company&apos;s main civil design team, which is based atHatfield and this might have to be disbanded.2.
CONHDENTLtt,210.   The situation on the engine side is even more difficult to predict.If their expected engine programmes go ahead, Rolls Royce will heextremely short of capacity over the next decade and even with substantial productivity increases they will be unable to cope withtheir orders without substantial subcontracting.   It is not possibletherefore to predict where and how many potential jobs would be lostif the PJB.207 programme were cancelled.Advanced Combat Aircraft11.   Abandonment of the advanced combat aircraft project (as either anational project or a collaborative project in which Britain played a leading part) would have the most serious long term consequences forthe technical viability of the industry (airframes, engines, andequipment).   Once the capability of developing advanced military aircraft was lost it would be a long and costly process to replace it.The effects would spread into the engine and equipment industries aswell as the airframe industry and into the ability of any of them tomaintain themselves in the forefront of technological advance which inthe longer term, is essential if Britain is to maintain a viable civil aircraft industry, with its import saving and export earning potential,in a rapidly expanding market.12.   Current employment on an advanced military aircraft is still smalland restricted to preliminary design work at BAC (Warton) and atRolls Royce (Patchway).   Depending on the eventual UK share of thetotal project package, it could reach a peak of approaching 20,000in the mid 1970s.   Without an advanced combat aircraft, the designteam at Warton would quickly break up and with it the UK&apos;s capability of producing advanced combat aircraft.13.   A considerable degree of commonality has been established betweenthe RAF Operational Requirement for an advanced military aircraft and the requirement for a multirole aircraft to replace the P104aircraft at present in service in several Western European nations and Canada.   International discussions are now taking place about thepossibility of a collaborative project to meet all requirements which in value total well over  3,000m.   The abandonment of the UKadvanced military capability would destroy our chances of sharing inthis lucrative market.3.
