DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYrS GOVERNMENT)0(68^94 COPY NO. J3u29th July, 1968CABINETLOCATION OF THE INLAND REVENUE SCHEDULE E&quot; COMPUTER CENTRE FOR SOUTHERN england in his memorandum (C(68) 89) of 25th July, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer has explained why he dissents from the decision of the ministerial Committee on Environmental Plannirg that the PAYECentre for Southern England should be located at Plymouth.    Thepurpose of this memorandum is to explain why it is important thatthe decision of the Environmental Planning Committee should be upheldand affirmed by the Cabinet.2.      Plymouth was selected by the Environmental planning committee rather than Portsmouth/Southampton because a Plymouthlocation would accord with our regional and dispersal policies whilePortsmouth/Southampton would not.     The Committee appreciated thepoint made in paragraph 5 of the Chancellor^ paper, that under the agreed programme several other Computer Centres had been or wouldbe located in or near the development areas.    But the objectives ofour regional policies include a better distribution of office employmentin all parts of the country.    Although the Inland Revenue ComputerCentres will make a useful contribution towards this in Scotland, theNorth and in South Wales, this does not, of itself, mean that theopportunity of assisting the South West Region should be ignored.3.     In paragraph 2 of his paper the Chancellor refers to theadditional expense and delay which would occur if the Centre were established at Plymouth instead of Portsmouth/Southampton.    It wouldunderstandably be easier for the Inland Revenue to set up a ComputerCentre at Portsmouth/Southampton as they have more staff in the area.But the delay is a less clear-cut question.    This is based on an officialestimate looking ahead to the late 1970s on which it was difficult to agreebasic assumptions, particularly as in this case they look so far ahead.It could well be that the Plymouth office could, in practice, be set upmore quickly than envisaged in the estimates.4.     Moreover, the theoretical delay resulting from locating theCentre at Plymouth would be approximately the same as that involvedin setting up the Edinburgh Centre,    On this, the Report of the official committee on Dispersal explained that the Inland Revenue staff would prefer Edinburgh to any other site in or near a development area;thus there was reason to hope that the delay might in fact be significantly reduced at this location.     Plymouth also is an attractive location for-1-
staff and there seems no reason to doubt that if the Inland Revenue tooksteps to emphasise this to their staff, the delay could be reduced in which the same way as for Edinburgh.    The attractiveness of Plymouthalso makes it hard to accept the Chancellor *s view that it would be moredifficult to persuade staff to transfer to Plymouth or that the inclusionof Plymouth in the programme, instead of Portsmouth/Southampton,would significantly affect the attitude of the staff to the scheme as awhole.The Advantages of Plymouth5.     Although on general grounds of regional policy Plymouth is tobe preferred to Portsmouth/Southampton, it may assist my colleaguesif I set out a few of the more specific reasons why this Computer Centreshould be located at Plymouth.6.      The objectives of dispersal policy include the removal of worknot only from the London area but also from the South East Region.The work to be centralised in the Southern Computer Centre is nowperformed in local offices partly in the South East Planning region and partly in the South West Region.    If the Centre were to be located in the Portsmouth/Southampton area we should, in fact, be transferringsome work from the South West to the South East Region.7.     We must also have regard to the South West Planning Council.The Governments reply to the Draft Strategy prepared by the Council,accepted, in principle, that growth in Plymouth would be beneficial tothe South Western Development Area as a whole.    Although were fused the CounciPs recommendation for full development area status,we recognised the need for assistance to Plymouth on account of its importance as an urban centre for the whole of the far South West andpromised to take every opportunity of moving Government work there.8.     As was apparent from discussions with my colleagues about theCouncil&apos;s recommendation, it will continue to be far from easy toprovide effective answers to the problems of Plymouth and the Develop-ment Area.      It is not an area that is basically attractive to industry,with its limited industrial base.    It is heavily dependent on defenceemployment and the recent decision to divert the Joint Anti-SubmarineSchool from Plymouth to Portsmouth is an indication of the difficulties that we shall have in maintaining, let alone increasing the level ofdefence employment.     The Computer Centre with its considerableopportunities for clerical employment would make a major contributionto Plymouth&apos;s problems.9.     We have recently been obliged to refuse the proposal for thedevelopment of the West Dock at Bristol, a project which was strongly supported by the South West Economic Planning Council.    Thin was aserious blow to the Planning Council because it was a rejection of thesecond of their major recommendations and makes it all the moreimportant that we should honour our undertaking to them by providingmore Government office employment at Plymouth.-2-
10.     But possibly the strongest reason for not locating the Centre at portsmouth/Southampton lies in the recent announcement of theGovernments acceptance of the large-scale development put forward in the South Hampshire Study.    The Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment^ announcement on 10th July explained that the growth ofthe South Hampshire area would be based on existing industry, or industry tied to the South East, together with office development.    TheGovernment made it clear that the area would not be allowed to attractindustrial and office expansion which would otherwise be suitable for thedevelopment areas and that it v/ould ensure that the planning of the area would be consistent with the Governments regional policies,,    It wouldbe quite contrary to the underlying intention of this recent announcement to allow the Southern Schedule E Centre to be set up in Portsmouth/Southampton.11.     Although there are some practical difficulties for the InlandRevenue in locating the Southern PAYE Centre at Plymouth instead ofat Portsmouth/Southampton, the Environmental Planning committee did not regard these difficulties as being insurmountable.    the objectives of our regional policies must be seen to be furthered in our decisions and I invite my colleagues to endorse the decision reached bythe majority of the Environmental Planning Committee that the Centreshould be located at Plymouth.P.S.Department of Economic Affairs, S.
