DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)0(68^91CABINETEUROPEAN AIRBUSMemo^andjamJ^At their meeting on 22nd July the Ministerial Steering Committeeon Economic Policy considered my memorandum on the European Airbus.2.      In summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that thebalance of opinion in the Committee was in favour of deferment of ade cision for four months on the lines proposed in paragraph 25(B) ofmy memorandum.    However, since the Cabinet would be consideringConcorde, and, since the future of Concorde and the European Airbuswere interrelated to some extent it would be advisable for the Cabinetto consider at the same time the Governments position in relation tothe A. 300 European Airbus.3.     I circulate accordingly at Appendix my memorandum forconsideration by the Cabinet,r.opv no  6 &apos;i!A. W. B.Ministry of Technology, S. W, lra26th July, 1968
APPENDIXEUROPEAN   AIRBUSIntroductionLast year the Cabinet agreed that we should enter the project definition phase of the Airbus project in collaboration with the French and Germans.     Inconveying their agreement, the Cabinet stipulated thatfor the project to go ahead to full development fivecriteria, including a limit of  130M on total airframelaunching costs, should be met (see Annex I).     Thesubstance of these criteria was incorporated in aMemorandum of Understanding between ourselves and theFrench and Germans signed last September.2.     Our main objectives in joining with the French and germans on the Airbus were these;-(a) to continue as designers and builders oflarge civil aircraft.    This is a rapidly expanding business (world traffic islikely to reach three times its present level by 1980) with a big export earning/import saving potential.    But we recognisedthat it would be difficult to stay in this field, in the face of growing Americancompetition, except in collaboration withother countries who would share the cost and provide a bigger initial market\(b) To promote the interests of our aero-engine industry in Europe, and avoid ourAmerican rival, Pratt &amp; TiVhitney, getting a firm foothold in France, through linkingwith SNECMAi(c) to foster technological collaboration with europe in a field where our experience and resources should make us attractive partners.&apos;. /Present position
Present position3.     These aims remain valid if they can beachieved on an economic basis.     But two factorsnow cast doubt on the Airbus as a means of achievingthem. Firstly,   two American Airbuses have appeared:    while we always expected Americancompetition, the intense rivalry between Lockheedand Douglas has meant that they are offering air-craft, at least in the immediate future, at a cut price which is going to be hard to &quot;beat.Secondly, the costs which have emerged from theEuropean Airbus project study of the last year aredisappointingly high and, as they stand, offerlittle prospect of an economic return.h.     Briefly, estimates of launching costs (see annex II) have risen since last year from a totalof  186.5M ( 130M for the airframe and  56.5M forthe engine) to a total, as estimated by contractors,of  333m ( 255M for the airframe including a con-contingency of  80M, plus  78M for the engine).     the airframe contractors have now agreed to accept amaximum Government contribution of  190M for the airframe, subject to revision in the event of a&quot;serious mishap&quot;&apos;- in the programme.     The enginecost will be fixed.     This would imply a totalcost of  268M ( 190M for airframe andiS78M forengine).     Total costs to the Governments wouldbe some  250M ( 190M for airframe and  601 forengine).     Of this HMG&apos;s share would be about 75M and  l+OM, or  115M in total.5.     The selling price to achieve the necessarycompetitive margin over the American airbusesquoted at about  61 would probably have to bearound  if.. 3/U. 6M but manufacturers are at presentquoting a bare production cost of some  I4..5M(based on production of 300 aircraft) so thatthere is no margin for recovery of Governments&apos;investment and for the profits which firms willexpect to earn.      (The position on the enginealone is more favourable - Rolls Royce have beenable to quote a price which includes a reasonablemargin.     This is of particular importance to us,since UK is contributing 75% of the engine costs and will get 75% of the return).6.     On the other hand, the Airbus concept stillseems right, and it should be possible to makethe aircraft fully competitive technically andacceptable to the three National airlines andother potential customers.     BEA&apos;s attitude hasnow been set out in a letter from the Chairmanto the President of the Board of Trade (see/Annex ...* This phrase has not been defined and would notbe acceptable.
Annex III) in which he forecasts a requirement of19 aircraft up to March 1980 and says that BEAwould hope (subject to agreement on specification,performance and price) to negotiate a contract forthe first 9, with an option on the next 10, by theend of 1968.     Despite Lufthansa&apos;s public refusal of any commitment so far, the Federal GermanGovernment are confident of getting their order for 20 aircraft.     There is likely to be nodifficulty with Air France, who expect to order36.     Thus an assured market of 75 from the 3 national airlines is still a reasonable possi-bility by the end of the year,7.     At the selling prices mentioned above( if..3/L)..6M) there is a good possibility of sales of 200/300 by 1980, the lower of these figuresassuming that we encounter competition also from another twin-engined airbus (there is a possi-bility of Boeing entering the field).     The totalworld market by 1980 for this type of aircraft,excluding markets for which the longer rangeLockheed and Douglas Airbuses are more suitable,is likely to approach 700, of which slightly over half would be in Worth America.     Sales of 300European Airbuses would therefore involve captur-ing a large   proportion of the market outsideNorth America, and a modest proportion of themarket in North America.     Sales would continueafter 19809 though development of the designwould probably by then be necessary.Tripartite discussions8.     The Airbus Directing Committee,, which is the senior tripartite official level Committee dealingwith the Airbus, has agreed to recommend to ministers at their meeting on 30th July that:-(a) the general concept of the aircraft is right and that subject to the qualifications below it could havethe desired commercial success,entering service in 1973;(b) the manufacturers must- lower their production costs by atleast 10$) so as to give a bettermargin between costs and permissibleselling price;- offer better performance guaranteesto airlines;/undertake ...
- undertake the entire financial responsibility for production,subject only to Governments under-writing a minimum number of sales(say, 75 aircraft);- quote a fixed margin for the recovery of Governments&apos; investment,reducable only pro rata with areduction of manufacturers&apos; profitif this is necessary in order tosecure a particular sale;(c)    the national airlines must be ready toassume commitments on the scaleenvisaged in the Airbus Memorandum of understanding (i.e. the 75 aircraft).9.     The Airbus Directing Committee recommends that unless these conditions can be achieved with-in four months, the project should not continue.The French and Germans, to avoid forfeiting theinterest of world airlines (and no doubt also toget us more firmly committed) would like this tobe represented as a decision by Governments nowto go ahead to completion provided the conditionscan be met within four months *     We have arguedthat5 if pressure on the contractors is to bemaintained, the four months should simply beregarded as an extension of the present projectstudy, with Government decisions reserved untilNovember.Economic Assessment10.    On the manufacturer^ present productioncost estimates, the implied preference and impliedsubsidies (for the UK) for sales of variousnumbers of aircraft are as follows;    sales of 125 .are shown since this figure was mentioned in theoriginal Cabinet criteria:-Implied Preference   Implied Subsidy125 sales 53% hS%200 sales 27% 26%250 sales 19% 20%300 sales 12% 15%If, as now proposed, the manufacturers reduce their production costs by a full 10%, the figures would be:/implied Preference- k -CONFIDENTIAL
125 sales200 sales250 sales300 sales18$? 25%9% 17fo3% 12%The next four months&apos; work may permit some further improvement in these figuress since there areproposals for increasing the seating capacity ofthe aircraft5 which would allow an increase in itscompetitive selling price.Effect on Estimates 1968/6911.    The original authority for the one year&apos;work during the project study phase up to 31st Julywas ;S6Mo     Hawker Siddeley and Rolls Royce expect to spend only some  ijil and it should Toe possibleto accommodate the cost of the extra four monthswork ( 2M or less) within the original authority.12o If the project goes aheads we estimate thatwe shall spend  6.0M in 1968/69. If we stop atthe end of July, there would he a saving of some 3.0M; if we go on to the end of November, the saving would be about  1M. These figures allow for running-down costs.7Aiew^ of the^U-fIrms13.    I have seen Sir Arnold Hall and Sir DenningPearson to learn their views about the project-Both believe that the A.300 is the right aircraft and both argue that a decision to opt out of the airbus would be to yield; perhaps permanentlysto American airframe domination in Europe and world markets.1h.   Hawker Siddeley believe that the project canbe improved technicallys and they would aim to tackle this with Sud Aviation and Deutsche Airbusduring the next 3 months.     They believe that itis a worthwhile project, but are not prepared toincrease their stake beyond the  5M contributionto launching costs already offered.      (They wouldalso be at risk for capital expenditure of some 3/hM, and in quoting fixed prices).     They seek a guarantee that their education or &quot;learning&quot;costs, incurred during early production, will be recovered.     They estimate these costs at  30IJLIn practice, recovery of one-third of this sumwill be assured over the first 75 orders, so HSAare seeking a Government guarantee for losses upto  20M if sales fall short of 200.- 5 -
15.   Rolls Royce attach great importance to themaintenance of an airframe industry in Britain or within a Western Europe collaborative framework,including Britain.      They want to go ahead withthe RB 207 engine which they &quot;believe is the rightengine for the Airbus.     They v/ould like to seekapplications for this engine in America though they are less optimistic about this than theywere some time ago.16.   Rolls are prepared to finance some 30 per cent of the costs falling to the United Kingdom andamounting to about  15-181.17.   Rolls share our view that the aircraft production cost should be reduced by at least10 per cent but do not believe that the enginecosts could be reduced as a part of this exercise.The^ Choice that has to be made18.   The choice confronting us on Airbus is an extremely difficult one.     On the one hand, Iwould not recommend us to proceed with the projectas now defined and costed, because it is not aneconomic proposition.19-    On the other handt a decision by us, thismonth, to withdraw from the Airbus before the firms had been given an opportunity to correctknown defects would be a very grave one indeed.Its long term implications for the Europeanaircraft industry would be extremely serious andwith it the basis upon which the long term futureof Rolls Royce,  in their judgment largelydepends.20.    In these circumstances, a political decisionof considerable importance will have to be takenby the Cabinet and I am setting out below, asclearly as I can, what are the arguments on each side.     These lead me to the opinion, that at nofurther cost than has already been authorised, weshould prolong the project definition stage, lay down clear criteria by which we shall decide inadvance and apply them when this further work hasbeen completed.The Case for stopping now21.    The case for stopping now can be briefly summarised as follows -(1)    Certain of the criteria incorporated in the Memorandum of Understandinghave not been met.
CONHDENTUL225(2)    The project, as now defined, is noteconomically viable.(3)    There is no certainty that significantlybetter figures will emerge after four months.(k)    Costs estimates have already risensharply and there is a real danger offurther increases which governments will have to finance.(5)   The aircraft performance which the manufacturers have so far beenprepared to guarantee does not meetthe airline requirements.(6)    To achieve the required sales the selling price would have to be kept so low that even on optimistic assumptions only about 80 per cent of the Exchequer&apos;contribution would be recovered.(7)    The management of the project by Sudhas so far shown some deficiencies,and our power to intervene directly is limited.(8)   On a realistic forecast of sales, theimplied preference and subsidy are too high to be acceptable and some resourcesdevoted to other purposes would yieldbetter results.(9)   The increase in public expenditure,even assuming costs can be contained,would require the PESC provision to beincreased by  2M in 1969/70,  8M in1970/71 and a further  81 in 1971/72which would require corresponding-savings to be found elsewhere.(10) For these reasons the project is noteconomic, our support for it should be withdrawn and the longer we continue,the harder it will be to withdraw.The case for nrolono-inp: the project definition22. The case for prolonging the project definitionis -(a)    World traffic is likely to treble by1980 and much of it will require airbuses.If Europe does not make them, the americans will dominate the worldairframe industry./(b)...:
(b) Our European aircraft policy was basedupon the belief that the extended marketoffered by European airline procurementpossibilities, plus the sharing of research and development costs repres-ented the best way of staying in thisgrowth industry.(c) The A.300 is the right sort of aircraft and the prospects of selling it at theright price are good.(d) The prospects of getting the Europeanairlines to provide an assured market of75 aircraft, as a basis for a decisionto go ahead are reasonably good.(e) Rolls Royce regard a European airframeindustry of fundamental importance totheir long term future.     The productionof large aircraft is a labour intensiveindustry and lower European labour costsshould be capable of offsetting theadvantages the Americans enjoy in bettermanagement, production technology and capital investment in equipment.(f) There is no other possible Europeancombination that could meet this parti-cular market.(g) The decision to cancel now before weare satisfied that the Airbus cannotbe made at the right price and on theright conditions, would involve reach-ing a decision on the European airframeindustry before all the necessary factswere available,(h) The French and-German Governments would hold us responsible for wrecking animportant and promising project.Without the cast iron economic arguments which might be available in four monthstime, we co\.ild not rebut such an allegation-tion either to our partners or in public.23.    The knowledge that Britain would not beprepared to go ahead unless certain criteria were met should force the French and the Germans to amore realistic attitude and should improve theprospects of achieving the improvements required./2k    . . .
2k.    I &quot;believe that it v/ould be easier to withdraw from the project in four months time if the firmsdo not come up with more acceptable proposals.If we withdraw now, before the improvementsrequired have been considered we shall undermineour future prospects of collaboration with Europenot only in civil but also perhaps in military aircraft, e.g. the Advanced Combat Aircraft.The fact that this decision would follow so soon after a succession of other negative decisions inthe technological field (ELDO, GETS, and CERNaccelerator) would if it could not be clearlyjustified damage us as potential technologicalpartners for Europe in any field.Alternative Courses of Action25. In these circumstances, two courses of actionare open -(A) Withdraw now, announcing this at themeeting of Ministers on July 30th inParis and declining to support thefurther studies which the AirbusDirecting Committee has recommended,and which the French and Germans willstrongly urge.(B) Lay down criteria which we would insist upon as follows -(i)    that the production cost be cut by at least 10 per cent;(ii)    that performance guarantees forairlines be improved;(iii)    that an assured market for 75aircraft, underwritten by governments,   emerges;(iv)    that the recovery of theGovernments investment be on thebasis of a fixed margin, reducableonly in conjunction with areduction of manufacturers&apos;profit to secure particular sales.And say that if our partners are prepared to accept these criteria, and embody them in an agreed statement, we should agree that a decision as towhether to go ahead should be deferred to a further conference in four months time.     We should makeit clear that a decision to go ahead will depend/on the ...
on the size of the margin, the prospect of sales,and hence on the likelihood of Governmentsrecovering at least a reasonable proportion oftheir investment.26.    The cost of the necessary work in the U.K.during this period could be contained within exist-ing budgets for the project definition.Re co mmenda tion27.    I recommend to my colleagues that we should adopt Course of Action (B) and should present this as our view at the tripartite meeting to beheld on July 30th.A.W.B.Ministry of TechnologyMillbank Tower S.W.1.18th July, 1968.- 10 -
ANNEX ITHE CABINET&apos;S PRE-REQUISITESThe criteria against which the Cabinet agreed that adecision to continue the project should be taken were as follows.     The present position on each is shown In brackets.(i)     there must be an assured market for75 aircraft in the national airlinesof the three participating countries and a reasonable expectation of atleast 50 sales to other countries;(it may be possible to achieve thisby end November).(ii)     the launching costs should not exceed the estimate of  130m. for the airframeand should be re-examined in an effort to achieve a significant reduction;(see Annex II)(iii)     a Rolls-Royce engine must be adopted;(Accepted)(iv)     there had to be an assurance that directoperating costs 30$ below those of current jet aircraft and an in-servicedate of 1972-3 could be achieved;(This will be achieved at the selling price suggested, but comparison with theAmerican airbuses is now more significant.In-service date is 1973).(v)     the manufacturers would have to take a proper share in the financing of theprogramme.    (HSA will contribute  5m,Rolls Royce about  15/I8m.)

ANNEX IIIBRITISH EUROPEAN AIRWAYSProm the ChairmanSir Anthony Milward, C.B.E.,Bealine House, Ruislip, Middlesex,CH/70328th June,  1968.The Rt. Hon. Anthony Crosland, M.P. ,President of the Board of Trade,1, Victoria Street,London, S.\7. 1 .My dear President,I understand that a meeting of Ministers is due to beheld in the middle of July to discuss the European airbusproject, and that it would be helpful If you had a letterfrom me setting out BEA&apos;s position in relation to it.As has already been made clear, both to yourDepartment and to the Ministry of Technology, the A300European Airbus as now projected is a considerably largeraircraft than BEA would have chosen.    We believe that inthe early 1970&apos;s our need is for an aircraft with a seatingcapacity of about 200 seats in all-tourist layout, whereas the A300 Airbus would, so I understand, be a 300-seaterall-tourist aircraft.    Because the A300 would be so largethere is necessarily only a small number of routes onwhich BEA could use it economically, and with sufficientfrequency,  in the second half of the 1970&apos;s,  so that thenumber of this type of aircraft we would want would be correspondingly smaller than for a 200-seater aircraft.In the light of the information now available to us,however, BEA would find the A300 aircraft acceptable withthe following characteristics;-a) Seating capacity (all-tourist, 32&quot; pitchseating with hot meal service)?    300b) Range with full passenger payloads    1200 nm.c) Airfield required for above mission, in ISA4-10oc,to be not more than 7,400 ft.d) Seat mile cost to be 5 per cent better thanLockheed 1011 with similar seating standard and without import duty.,:;e) The noise level to be such as to conform withany U.K. noise legislation which applies duringthe aircraft&apos;s operating life.   --1-
Provided also that a satisfactory specification (with adequate performance guarantees), an acceptable price andother satisfactory contract terms can be negotiated, BEA&apos;present estimates are that it would require a total of 19A300 aircraft between 1974 and 1930 with deliveries asfollows;-Winter 1974/75 31975/76 31976/77 31977/78 31978/79 3&quot;       1979/80 4I must add that in referring in paragraph (d) above toa seat mile cost 5$ better than the Lockheed 1011 we feel it necessary to make a comparison with the competition whichthe airbus will have to meet.    This basis is, however,different from the basis used in our forecasts submitted toyou in connection with out claim for compensation;    thoseforecasts were based on a cost per seat mile 15$ below thatof a Boeing 727/200.    The airbus on this basis made a largecontribution to our improved results in the later years of out forecasts and our results would be less favourable if thenew cost standard does not match up to the old one.We would hope to be able to bring contract negotiations to finality by the end of 1968 for the purchase of the first9 aircraft to the delivery dates mentioned above, a number which would meet all our requirements until 1977.    In viewof the long term risks involved in buying an aircraft whichis not designed entirely to our requirements for periods oftime as far as ten to twelve years ahead, I believe that wewould be prudent in covering the next ten aircraft by optiononly, the whole to be subject, of course, to obtaining thenecessary investment approval from you.Yours sincerely,Anthony Milward.
