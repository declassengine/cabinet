SrHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY rS GOVERNMENT)0(68^83 COPY NO;CABINETNote by the Secretary of State for defence i circulate herewith for the approval of my colleagues thedraft supplementary statement of Defence Policy 1968, revised inthe light of the conclusions of the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee on 28th June, 1968.D. W. K.Ministry of Defence, S. W. 1.2nd July, 1968R 9
DRAFTSUFPJLE?ffiKT^RY DEFENCE WHITE PAPERINTRGDUCTIONIn its Statement on Public Expenditure (Cmd 3515) on16th January, 1968, the Government made it clear that &quot;it isnot only in our own interests hut in those of our friends andallies for this country to strengthen its economic basequickly and decisively.   There is no military strength,whether for Britain or for our alliances, except on thebasis of economic strength;    and it is on this basis thatwo can best ensure the security of this country.   We there-fore intend to make to the alliances of which we are membersa contribution related to our economic capability whilstrecognising that our security lies fundamentally in europe and must be based on the North Atlantic Alliance&quot;2,     It therefore decided that, apart from those needed tomeet certain residual obligations to dependent territories,particularly Hong Kong, Britain&apos;s defence forces shouldby the end of 1971 be concentrated in and on Europe.   Thetotal number of men now in the forces would consequently bereduced by some 20^, and substantial savings would be madein defence spending.   In spite of the growing cost of modern weapons-systems, defence expenditure in 1969/70 wouldbe cut below the already reduced level planned for 1968/69.By 1972/73 the effects of our withdrawal and the rundownwould enable the defence budget to be cut by a further 210-260M.3.     The I969Y70 target is  225UM, which is the equivalent,at 1968 prices, of the  21kOM shown in the table appended toCmnd 3515 (which was expressed in 19&amp;7/prices); ...
prices);      it thus reflects the  110M cut announced in para 2h of that paper.   The current forecast for 1972/73 is 201h-M at 1968 prices which, allowing again for pay and price changes, is within the range of defence budget targetsset in Cmnd 3515.   Similarly, our forecasts for the period between I9S9/70 and 1972/73 are inside the limits laid downin January,   The Government is confident that it will keepwithin these forecasts.U.     Since publishing the Statement on the Defence Estimates1968 (Cmd 3540) the Government has concentrated on fourmajor areas of defence policy affected by its decisions of16th January, 19&amp;8, with the following results:a. It has prepared plans for withdrawing british forces from their bases in the Persian Gulf and SouthEast Asia by the end of 1971 and has consulted theGovernments in the areas concerned about means of developing a new basis for peace and stability afterBritish forces have left,b. It has decided what initial improvements it can offer in Britain&apos;s contribution to NATO as a result.c. It Is producing a more detailed programme forreshaping the organisation and equipment of theforces up to 1972/73 so as to meet the targets for financial and manpower reductions announced on16th January, 1968.do     It has made progress in defining the character ofour forces in the European area when the withdrawal and rundown are complete.
CQNFfDINTIALIITHE FAR EAST5.     On 1st April, 1968, the total of those working in or forthe forces in Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, including ships&apos;companies on sea service in the Far East Fleet, numbered73,000.     It,   included about 31,000 UK Servicemen, 8,000Gurkhas, 5,000 locally enlisted service personnel, over1,000 UK based civilians and 28,000 locally engaged civilians.The size of these forces is a measure of the task whichconfronts us in bringing back our own personnel to Britainand of the problems that will consequently confront the local governments.6.     We have prepared an outline plan for the phased rundownand withdrawal of these personnel and for the release of ourlocal base establishments and facilities, and have begun to implement its first stages;    as already announced, the brigade of Gurkhas will be run down to 6,000 by the end of 1971.   in planning the rundown, we have sought to make immediate savings of expenditure while ensuring that our forces in the arearemain able to meet their commitments.   We have also sought to minimise the social, family and personal difficulties thatinevitably accompany so large a redeployment, to allow timefor Malaysia and Singapore to adjust their economies, and topermit the evolution of a new pattern for security in the area7.     We have agreed with the local trade unions on thearrangements which will apply to local civilians who are maderedundant as a result of our withdrawal.8,     We have announced an offer of aid to Malaysia and singapore to help in offsetting the effects of our withdrawal and have undertaken to hand over, free of charge,thoseService lands and fixed assets which the two governments wishto use for economic or defence purposes.   We hope by this/means .....
means to make a substantial contribution to plans for theeconomic development and defence of Malaysia and Singapore.The value of the installations to be handed over, and of the equipment to be transferred with them, will be reported toParliament at the appropriate time.9.     One of the most important assets to be transferred isthe Singapore naval dockyard, which will be handed over tothe Singapore Government towards the end of this year to be converted for commercial ship repairing.   Messrs Swan Hunterhave been appointed managing agents for the company which isbeing formed by the Singapore Government to run the dockyardafter transfer.10.   The dockyard buildings and installed dockyard equipment will be handed over to the Singapore Government free of charge.   These facilities, which cover an area of some 130acres, will include the large King George VI graving dock,five floating docks, berths, cranes, and numerous workshops.Machine tools and other equipment needed for the continuedoperation of the dockyard will also be transferred.   We aredisoussing with the Singapore Government and the managingagents precisely what will be required.    The net book valueof assets transferred is expected to be approximately  3-fM.11.   When the transfer takes place, the labour force oflocally engaged civilians now employed in the dockyard willbe available for re-employment by the new Company.    It isexpected that over 3,500 workers will be offered jobs.   Somenaval officers and United Kingdom civilians now occupyingmanagement and supervisory posts in the dockyard will beinvited to serve in the new company on secondment during its initial stages.   The dockyard will continue for some years to undertake repair work for the Royal Navy, thus easing the transition to commercial work.12.   Firm foixndations for new defence arrangements were laid/by.....
by the Five Power Conference held in Kuala Lumpur on 10th and11th June, 1968 at the invitation of the Prime Minister of malaysia.   In particular, Malaysia and Singapore declared thatthey regarded the defence of their two countries as indivisiblethat they would work together, and that they would do their utmost for their own defence while welcoming co-operation and assistance from the other three Commonwealth countries.The communique that was issued after the conference is printedas Annex A to this Statement.13.   In view of the distance between Hong Kong and the UnitedKingdom, our withdrawal from Singapore and Malaysia willrequire certain increases to the forces in Hong Kong, andsome support facilities previously provided in Malaysia and singapore will have now to be located in the Colony itself.Ik.   We have explained the implications of our withdrawal toour SEATO allies and have informed them of the changes we aremaking in our force contributions to SEATOTs contingency plansduring our withdrawal.   When we have completed the withdrawal,we shall not declare forces to these contingency plans,although we shall remain members of the Organisation.
iii the PERSIAN GULF15     The withdrawal of our forces from the Persian Gulf will mean &quot;bringing hack by the end of 1971 some 6,000 men, themajority of whom are on unaccompanied tours of dtity.   Theyare at present concentrated in two main areas.   At Bahrein,apart from the various headquarters, there are the royal naval base, about half the army forces, the main communicationscentre, and the RAF&apos;s ground-attack, fighter reconnaissance and transport aircraft.   The aircraft are &quot;based at Muharraq,which is also an important civil airport.   At Sharjah the tactical transport and maritime aircraft are located on the airfield and the rest of the army forces are stationed nearby.16.   In parallel with the withdrawal of our forces, we wishto see a steady evolution in the local arrangements for defence and co-operation.   We have already come to an agree-ment with the State of Kuwait for the future termination ofthe 1961 Agreement,which imposes a specific defence commitment on us.   We still have special treaty relationships not only with 3ahrein and Sharjah, where our forces are based, butalso with all the Trucial States and Qatar, under which weare responsible for their external defence and for the conductof their foreign policy.    These States appreciate the import-ance of using the intervening period to work out arrangements whereby they can emerge successfully into unqualifiedindependence in close co-operation with one another and withthe support of their larger neighbours.   We welcome the initialnegotiations that have already taken place between them.When the outcome of their negotiations is clearer, discussions about the disposal of our installations will be opened withthe Persian Gulf States.
IVEUROPE,17.     Our decision to withdraw British forces from South EastPersianAsia and the/Gulf by the end of 1971 and to concentrate our defence effort in Europe has made it possible for Britain tooffer immediate increases in the availability of some of herforces to NATO.   In deciding what additional forces should be offered and how we propose to deploy them, we must take accountof the views of our allies and of the way in which NATO is nowrevising its strategic thinking, partly in response to ourarguments.Mutual fore e.j?sduc t ijons18.     At their meeting in May of this year the NATO defence ministers agreed that the overall capability of NATO shouldnot be further reduced except as part of a pattern of mutualforce reductions balanced in scope and timing.   NATO ministers have approved the report of the Special Group which, among other things, laid down certain basic principles to guide the alliance in studying the possibility of balanced East/Westforce reductions as part of a longer term process to improve relations and redu.ee tension.    Such measures of arms control,if they could be introduced without loss of security, would create a better climate in which to approach Europe&apos;s major political problems and would release resources for more productive economic ends.I9.     Several types of possible force reduction agreements are under intensive study within NATO, and such factors as the nationality and type of forces, the geographical areas and the degree of verification which would be appropriate invarious situations are all being examined.   At their recent meeting in Reykjavik, the NATO Foreign Ministers called onthe Soviet Union and other East European countries to join with NATO in trying to secure progress in this field./Britain ..,
Britain attaches the greatest importance to the efforts whichthe Alliance is making to extend the detente.   NeitherBritain nor the Alliance can, however, advance very far inthis direction alone.   Moreover, careful preparation is needed to ensure that any measures which are eventually agreeddo not reduce the security of the Alliance as a whole.   the pursuit of detente and the maintenance of a credible Westerndeterrent are not contradictory but complementary.   NATO mustboth keep sufficient military strength to sustain the confid-ence on which progress towards a detente depends and mustdevelop a strategy which is not only appropriate to thew^rld in 1968 but can also be adapted to meet future possibleforms of mutual arms reduction without loss of security tothe Alliance.NATO&apos; s cpnyprntglmia 1 capability20.     NATO defence planning must pay special attention to possible situations below the level which would provoke a strategic nuclear response.   With active encouragement from britain, the Alliance has recently been concentrating on suchsituations.   As reported in Chapter I of the Statement on theDefence Estimates, 1968 (Cmnd 35^0), NATO strategy now placesa greater emphasis on maximizing the conventional capability of such forces as the allied Governments are willing toprovide.    That is why last year NATO decided to plan to useearlier in a conventional role combat aircraft which have adual capability but have hitherto been reserved for nuclearoperations.Anti-ballistic Missiles21.     NATO now recognizes that, while it must keepdevelopments in the anti-ballistic missile under constant review, there is at present no case for establishing an anti-ballistic missile system in Western Europe.   No system nowconceivable could prevent unacceptable damage by nuclear/missiles ....
missiles in Western Europe, particularly since an attack wouldbe accompanied by heavy bombing from manned aircraft.   Thecost of developing any anti-ballistic missile system would bemuch greater than the expense to which the Soviet Union wouldbe put in improving its offensive capability sufficiently toneutralise it.   The problems of organising the collectivecommand and control of a nuclear anti-ballistic missile system would,  since it must be used within seconds of animpending attack, be extremely formidable.Tji^Solidariti^of^jthe Alliance22.     Provided the present range of military forces availableto the Alliance as a whole is kept effective, it should besufficient to deter an attack at any level by a rational enemy.The will and solidarity of the Alliance are, therefore, the key to its security.   In Central Europe, this solidarity isguaranteed by the fact that forces of many allied countries are serving side by side under one Commander.    On the flanks,the best safeguard of NATO&apos;s political solidarity is itsability rapidly to move in a multi-national force to assistthe local powers in resisting attack.   For this purpose the alliance must maintain substantial naval, air and land forces,which can be quickly deployed on the flanks in case of need.Here the Allied Command Europe Mobile Force and the StandingNaval Force Atlantic have a special role.   As a consequenceof the recent increase in Soviet activity at sea, NATO isattaching more importance to maritime reconnaissance in theMediterranean.S itgiiQ.2jjydJ4^^23.     The importance of the change in defence policy whichthe Government decided in January 1968 will be reflected inan increase in Britain&apos;s military support for NATO.Hitherto, our allies in NATO have acknowledged the contri-bution to world peace and stability, which our forces/outside ....
outside Europe have made and they have judged our contribu-tion to NATO accordingly.   But, as we withdraw our forces from their stations overseas and concentrate them in Europe,we shall need to make a larger contribution to the Alliance.2k.     As already announced, we have decided to keep a smallnaval force in the Mediterranean.   We have also decided toforearmark/assignment to NATO the whole of 3 Division(consisting of 3 brigades), 16 Parachute Brigade (less one battalion) and 22 Special Air Service regiment.   All theseare now based in the United Kingdom as part of the new ArmyStrategic Command.   The ground-attack squadrons and short-range transport aircraft of No. 38 Group RAF will be similarlyearmarked.   Together with 3 Division and the parachute force,they will form a mobile task force.   Two Royal Navy commandoships with their embarked Royal Marine Commandos and twoassault ships with other Commandos will also be committed.A commando ship and a Royal Marine   Commando will take partin NATO exercises in the Mediterranean next year.   We areearmarking an Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron now requested by SACEUR to form part of the land element of the allied command Europe Mobile Force, and are taking steps to improveboth the short-range and the strategic air mobility of this force.   Air lift for the Army units mentioned will beprovided by transport aircraft of Air Support Command.These additional contributions, which will lead to/closer association of our land, sea and air forces with the restof NATO have been welcomed by our allies.2g.     Nearly all these improvements in our contribution to NATO take effect immediately. Under standard NATO procedure,countries ^u^,/commit forces firmly to NATO for only one year ahead butindicate their plans for the subsequent four years.   Weare therefore informing NATO also that, compared with the forward plans which we submitted last year, and in addition/to ....
to the changes already announced, we can now offer thefollowing further contributions:a. from 1969, a squadron of Shackleton long rangemaritime reconnaissance aircraft, later to be re-equipped with Nimrods, will be transferred to Malta fromthe UK.b. from 1970, a guided missile destroyer will beadded to the frigate force in the Mediterranean, andfor part of that year one commando ship with a UKbased Royal Marine Commando Group embarked will alsobe stationed there;c. from 1970, the UK-based Rapier air defence unitsof the Royal Air Force,  and from 1971, the Phantomaircraft^which under previous plans would have beensent to the Persian Gulf and Far East, will be committed to NATO.Moreover, we shall be confirming to NATO that all BuccaneerMark 2 and Phantom aircraft that enter service with theRoyal Air Force over the period I969 to 1972 will be committed to the Alliance.
commercially which will incorporate the latest developments in frigate construction, including all gas turbinepropulsion and operate with a much smaller complement thanthe LEANDER class.   This ship will be ordered as soon as its design has been satisfactorily completed, and it will lead into the new class of frigates announced in the supplementary Statement on Defence Policy 1967 (Cmnd 3357)/ *b O    oooeoCOMBAT,. FORGES26.   The Statement on the Defence Estimates 1968 (Command3514.0), Chapter IV gave details of the planned combat forcesof the three Services.   The following paragraphs record pro-gress and decisions taken in the last few months.Nuclear Strategic Forces270   HMS RESOLUTION has successfully concluded the testfiring of Polaris missiles off Canoe Kennedy and is now fullyoperat ional.European Theatre Ground Forces28.   The move of one brigade to the United Kingdom has nowbeen completed.   The brigade will take part in a NATOexercise this Autumn in order to demonstrate its ability toredeploy quickly.Royal Navy General Purpose Combat Forces29.   Aircraft Carriers.   The refit of HMS ARK ROYAL is inhand.   The first Fleet Air Arm PHANTOMS have been delivered.Cruisers,   HMS BLAKE, the first of the TIGER Classcruisers to be converted for the operation of largehelicopters as a lead in to the new class of cruisers, v/illbe commissioned for service in her new role at the end ofthis financial year,30*   Frigates and Destroyers.   The older frigates and destroy^ersare now being phased out earlier;    and there have beenreductions in the planned rate of new construction.   Meanwhileorders for two more of the LEANDER class, which, will be theof their kindlast/ have been placed.   A new ship is being designed
to follow the LBANDER class.34.   An order for the first of the new class of destroyersequipped with the SEA DART guided missile will also heplaced as soon as the design is ready.   These ships will carry a modified version of the system, which will go to seafirst in HMS BRISTOL, now under construction.   The othermain weapon system in HMS BRISTOL, the IKARA quick reactionlong-range anti-submarine weapon, will also be fitted in anumber of the existing LEAEDER class frigates to give thema greatly improved anti-submarine capability.32.   Submarines.   Seven of the nuclear-powered Fleetsubmarines will be in service by the time that the carriersphase out in 1972.   The reduction in the rate of submarinebuilding announced in January means that the eighth submarinewill now not be ordered before the end of the year.Army General Purpose Combat Forces33.   The reduction of 17 major units announced in July 1967will be completed by April 1970.   By accelerating the cutsin our commitments, we shall make further roducti ons of 9major units (or their equivalent) by September 1972:details of these further reductions are given in Annex Bto this Statement.   During this period it might prove necessary to reduce by a further major unit or the equivalent.31].&apos;.   By the end of this period, the Army will beconcentrating mainly on its primary role of defending thecentral region of Allied Command Europe   However, the unitsof Army Strategic Command will be available for other taskssuch as     additional support for Allied Command Europe,provision of a small, balanced force to take part inUnited Nations&apos; peace-keeping operations, internal security in dependent territories, and assistance to allies in land operations outside the NATO area, when the Government so/decides. ...
dec ides.35.   We shall continue to maintain a highly professional andhighly trained Army,   By the early 1970s it will have muchnew equipment.   For example, it should be making extensiveuse of the 3A.3U0 light helicopter;    its light air-defencecapability will bo greatly improved by the introduction ofthe low-level surface-to-air missile RAPIER;    a new light gunwill be introduced into service;    the CHIEFTAIN re-equipment programme will be completed;    a new mortar-locating radar,CYlffiELINE, will be in service, and major advances are planned in night fighting equipment.Royal Air Force C-oneral Purpose Combat Forcesour3.6.   Following the withdrawal of/forces from the persian gulf and South East Asia, all RAF aircraft, except for asmall force in Kong Kong, will be based in the European and mediterranean areas.   Tactical strike/reconnaissance, close support and air defence squadrons will be able to play agreater part in ensuring air superiority for the NATOforces.   The newer aircraft - Buccaneers, Phantoms,Nimrods and Jaguars - will be equipped with the same dualcapability as the existing V-Bombcrs, Canberras andShackletons,37*   Steps are being taken to reduce the gap in our strike/reconnaissance capability following the cancellation of theP. Ill and France&apos;s withdrawal from the Anglo/French project for a variable geometry aircraft.   As an interim measure, wehave decided, to purchase a further 26 Buccaneers,   This willenable us both to continue allocating this type of aircraft to SACLANT and to maintain our tactical strike/reconnaissance contribution to SACSUR, when the Canberrasare phased out from Germany./ 3 8 e     . a a o .
38e   Studies are continuing in the Ministry of defence and in industry to determine the performance characteristicsneeded in an advanced combat aircraft for service in themiddle 1970s.   We are discussing the operational requirementwith Belgium, Canada, West Germany, Italy and the Netherlandsin order      to assess the possibilities of a collaborativeproject.   All of these are NATO countries which need a new aircraft in the same timescale.Air Mobility Forces39*     The strategic transport force will continue to beemployed for routine movements, training overseas, and emergency reinforcements until completion of the with-withdrawals from the Far East and Persian Gulf, for which itwill be needed in full.   The size of the transport force canthen be reduced by withdrawing the Argosies five years earlier than had been planned i.e, by the end of 1971.Thereafter, theprincipal   roles of air mobility forces willbe to move United Kingdom-based forces and reserves toGermany or to the flanks of NATO in an emergency, to supportthe overseas training of our forces, to provide logistic support for United Nations peace-keeping operations and to deploy forces overseas as, in I-IMGfs judgment, circumstancesrequire,
VIRESEARCH A.ND DEVELOPMENTI4.Q.     The Government carried out a comprehensive reviewof the research and development programme last year and announced last July (Cmnd 3357) that it expected to achieve a cut of about  30m.  in the previously plannedexpenditure in 1970/71.      It now expects to make a slightly larger reduction.k-l.     The number of staff employed on defence work in the research and development establishments of the Ministryof Technology and the Ministry of Defence will by 1970/71be reduced by about 1,100 including about 300 qualifiedstaff, compared with the numbers previously planned forthat year;   compared with the current numbers,  the reductions will amount to about 600 and 200 respectively.Most of the savings will be achieved by cuts in the overallstaff at the establishments.      Some of those released willbe transferred to work on the industrial applications ofdefence research and development.42.     There have been no changes in the major projects inthe programme for 1968/69 as set out in Chapter VI of theStatement on the Defence Estimates, 1968 (Cmnd. 3540).It is too soon to forecast the trend of research anddevelopment after 1970/71, but the shift in emphasis ino\ir defence policy towards Europe offers new opportunities for collaborating on major items of defence equipment andfor rationalising our research and development effort.
VIIRESHAPING THE ORGANISATION and support OF THE FORCESk3*     Logistic planning to implement the Government&apos;decisions of last January has necessarily been concentrated in the first place on the withdrawal of our forces from south East Asia and the Persian Gulf.     But we are at the sametime beginning to reduce support facilities in the UK to fitthe new strategy and the contraction of our forces.     Theseare the first steps towards a radical longer term reduction and re-organisation of the UK base.Withdrawal from Overseasijii.     we do not expect that the withdrawals will createany major difficulties of transport or accommodation.     the plans for acquiring houses and renovating barracks described in the Statement on the Defence Estimates 1968 (Cmnd. 35^0)are expected to meet our needs.Reductions in Support in the UKk$.     The UK base consists of a huge complex of large andimall establishments and installations, built up by theServices over the years to meet their different needs, the changing requirements of strategy and developments in organisation.     They comprise great capital assets:    major changes, which must take account of military requirements,the best use of existing accommodation, the supply of local labour and the demands of regional planning, can only bemade sensibly over a long period.     The problems of longterm re-organisation are aggravated by short term taskscreated by our withdrawal from overseas, which involves thereturn of considerable stocks of equipment to the UK.U.6.     In spite of the extra commitments imposed by our withdrawal, all three Services will make some earlyeconomies.     These are set out in the following paragraphs./The Royal Navy
The Royal Navyll7.     Small naval depots at Dover, Harwich and Dalmuirwill he closed this year,  and two Hydrographic establish-ments will he combined.     The phased closure of a research establishment at Harlow has begun and will be completednext year.The Armyh8.     The work of reshaping the training organisation has begun.     The two Schools of Artillery at Larkhill, andManorbier are, for example, to be concentrated at Larkhill;the REME Apprentice Colleges at Arborfield and Carlisle areto be amalgamated and two RCT training regiments will be merged together.     The Royal Engineers Support Group isreducing its stocks and closing a storage depot.     The REMErepair organisation in the UK is being trimmed by thereduction and amalgamation of repair workshops.     Thenumber of explosive storage depots is being cut by thereduction and redeployment of stocks.     The RAOC supportsystem is being re-organised;    in future, units will rejymore on direct issues from central holding points.     Thechange will start to take effect later this year.     TheArmy hopes by these and other measures to save about 1500posts in the current year.The Royal Air Force1+9.     The Royal Air Force has announced a major plan to reorganise its equipment supply depots.     As a resultNo. 25 Maintenance Unit, Hartlebury will be closed,  and accommodation stores for the three Services will be concentrated at No. 7 Maintenance Unit, Quedgeley.     the saving in personnel costs alone will be rather more than 1M a year.
.50.     The Services have already set work in hand on other major and longer term changes.      In some cases broaddecisions have been taken;    in other cases major investi-gations have begun.The Royal Navy5d.     The Royal Navy has already started a comprehensiveinvestigation into the support which will be required forthe future Fleet,  including the naval dockyards, stores and armament depots and the naval air stations.     Itexpects to close down about half of present naval airstations when fixed-wing flying ceases.     The rationalisation-tion of support arrangements for the Fleet Air Arm shouldproduce further savings.The Army52.     The reshaping of the training organisation willcontinue.     In particular the number of infantry depots will be reduced.     The system for thesupply and maintenance of the Army1 s stores and equipment will also be further streamlined.The Royal Air Force53.     A major study    of    the future requirements fordeployment of the operational units in this country and ofthe training and support organisations is in hand.      Itis already clear that some 20 RAF stations of all kindscan be closed by the mid-1970s, although we cannot say atpresent which these will be.Re-organisation of the Ministry of Defence5k-     At the same time that we are planning a smaller UKbase we are re-organising and cutting down the size of theMinistry of Defence.     Here again, in the shorter term the withdrawals from South East Asia and the Persian Gulfand the re-organisations and changes in the UK base must make extra work.     Nevertheless, we aim to make/substantial
substantial reductions In the Ministry of Defence by31st March,  1969.55.     The changes in the higher organisation of theMinistry announced the Statement on the Defence Estimates,1968 (Cmnd, 55hO) are well under way,     The new staff organisation under the Chiefs of Staff is working well.On 1st April two functional Second Permanent Under-Secretaries of State replaced the three former singleService Second Permanent Under-Secretaries of State,     Newunified Finance and Civilian Management organisations havebeen established.     A revised Defence Vote structure isbeing prepared for introduction by 1st April,  1970.     plans to set up unified Accounts and Contracts organisationsare being worked out.
VIIIPERSONNEL56,   The January, 1968 decisions impose three major tasks onthe Government in respect of the future manning of the Services,Sufficient men of the right quality must he recruited, if theServices are to he able to discharge their newly definedtasks In the 1970s,   When reductions are carried out   full account must be taken not only of the efficiency of theServices but also of the welfare of the individuals concerned;at the same time, skilled and semi-skilled men must be released for commerce and industry as fast as possible.Great attention must be paid to resettlement, so that themen so released can be employed most effectively.Recruitment57*   After the rundown has been completed, the Services willoffer secure and absorbing careers in work which is essentialto the security of the country.    Because they will be smaller,an even higher standard of efficiency will be required.This will demand good equipment, a continuous supply ofofficers and men of the highest quality, and the most modernmanagement techniques at all levels.   Thus the Services will&quot;be able to offer, great opportunities to fit, able andadventurous young men in a wide variety of highly technicaltrades, operational skills and administrative functions.    Inorder to maintain forces of the right age structure and experience, we shall still need about 35,000 recruits every year, a substantially higher rate of recruiting than we areachieving at present.58,   The Services are passing through a period of radical change.   Even now, they are modern in outlook and efficientin operation.   They are among the leaders of the country intechnological development, methods of administration, and/logistic .....
1-7ilogistic organisation.   The challenge which now faces themmeans that they must maintain and improve their position inthe lead.Rundown59     The rundown to the new force levels announced in theStatement on Defence Policy 1967 (Cmnd 3357)Supplementary/is already well under way. Between April 1967and April   1968, the strengths of United Kingdom uniformedofficers and other ranks were reduced by the following:Royal Navy 1930Army 6852Royal Air Force 3767We expect that the overall uniformed strength of the three services, compared with the levels in April   19^7* will fallduring the financial year 1973/197k by rather more than75,000 officers and men and that there will have been anadditional reduction of 20,000 Gurkhas and locally-enlistedpersonnel.   This will represent a reduction of about one quarter since the start of the Defence Review in 19&amp;5.60.   So far as possible, this reduction will be achieved by means of the normal outflow of men from the Services, andby some adjustment of recruitment and re-engagement incertain categories.   Redundancy will be kept to the minimum.We shall take into account the need to preserve a balancedage, rank and trade structure, and to safeguard the careerprospects of those now entering the Services.61.    The redundancy programme has now been in operation for over a year.   Up to April   1968, about 1,000 officers andmen left the Army and Royal Air Force under this scheme, in normal outflow of someaddition to the/hh,000 officers and men.     In 1968/69,a further h,000 officers and other ranks will bo discharged from the Army and Royal Air Force with redundancy terms.   Thegreat majority of those so far made redundant have beenvolunteers.   No-one will become redundant in the Royal Navy/until .....
until the rundown of the carrier force hegins to take effect.Resettlement62..   It is in the national Interest that the knowledge and ability of those leaving the Services should be used to thebest advantage in civilian life.   The Government recognises that servicemen should be helped to find scope for theirskill and experience in a new career.   We are, therefore,taking vigorous measures to expand and improve the ForcesResettlement Service.   This involves the Ministry of Defence,the Department of Employment and Productivity, and variousvoluntary bodies, who together provide a comprehensiveadvisory, training and employment-finding service.   Inaddition, the Secretary of State for Employment and productivity will invite an eminent industrialist to act asAdviser on Forces Resettlements He will keep under review the existing resettlement arrangements, suggest possible improvements, and enlist the co-operation of civilianemployers and organisations in placing Servicemen in suitable employment.   He will be assisted by the committee of officialsdescribed in the Statement on the Defence Estimates, 1968(Cmnd 35^0), Chapter X.Preserves63.   In April, 1967, the Army Emergency Reserve and theTerritorial Army were reorganised into the Territorial and army Volunteer Reserve.   Category III of this Reserve wasgiven a home defence role.    On l6th January, 1968, it was announced that home defence would be put on a care and main-tenance basis and that this would mean the disbandment ofT &amp; have III.   There is, however, a continuing need for efficient volunteer reserve forces to support the RegularArmy.   The units for this purpose are at present in CategoriesI and II of the T &amp; have, which are providing the country with more effective reserve forces than any since the end of&apos; /National ..... \Vr;
National Service.    The Government intends to maintain this force at a size, level of training and standard of equipmentsection of the Army&apos;s Reserves which have now to he reviewed in the light of the decisions on the size, shape and cornmit-ments of the regular forces as outlined in this Statement.Ah out 170,000 National Servicemen still have a liability forrecall under the National Service Acts, but this legislationcomes to an end on 30th June, 19&amp;9.   The Government does not wish to renew this legislation if other means can be found of providing the specialists who are at present not available from any other source.   A review is therefore being carriedout to determine what changes might profitably be made inthe training and other commitments of T &amp; have I and II, andin the organisation of other sections of the Reserves inorder to meet the new situation.    This review will take afew months.    While it is going on, T &amp; have III units willremain in being on the present basis against the possibility that some modest expansion of the facilities and manpowerfor T &amp; have I and II may be desirable and can be afforded.It is hoped to make a further announcement later in the year.Civilian Manpower62j.   In the Supplementary Statement on Defence Policy, 1967(Cmnd 3357), we said that by the mid-1970&apos;s there would bea reduction in civilian manpower of some 80,000.    TheStatement of Public Expenditure (Cmnd 3515) made it clearthat the reduction would be accelerated and that the a&amp;mwould be to increase the forecast reduction of 80,000civilians and to achieve this considerably earlier than previously planned.   Both these aims will be fulfilled, andwe expect the target figure to be reached in 1973-197^- andsubsequently to be exceeded as the United Kingdom base isreorganised to meet the requirements of our forces based in and on Europe.appropriate to its role.   The T &amp; have is, however,  only one
The Royal Defence College65.   In the Statement on the Defence Estimates 1968,  (Cmnd 35H-0)Chapter III, paragraph 9, we stated that recent economic developments and changes in the structure of the forces required a reconsideration of some aspects of the proposalspreviously announced for the Royal Defence College.   We stillintend that all the Service colleges should he federated intoa single Royal Defence Academy which will exercise a centralacademic and administrative control.    But we have concluded that the cost of setting up a Royal Defence College as asingle establishment at Shrivenham to educate regular officersof the non-technical arms up to degree standard cannot bejustified in the present economic climate.66.   It remains our aim,however, to offer young officerseducational opportunities similar to those available out-side the Services and to develop to the full extent theintellectual qualities increasingly demanded by a Servicecareer.   We propose to do this in two ways.   First, we shallincrease as far as possible the number of places available at universities for those officers who are able to reach the necessary standard.    Secondly, for the remainder we intendyearto provide a foundation/of academic training under the controlof the Royal Defence Academy at existing Service Colleges.Among the officers trained at the College who are unable to gain a University place, there will probably be some who would benefit from further academic education up to degree standard.We are now investigating possible ways and means of continu-ing the academic training of such officers beyond the foundation year.
IX ----&apos;TgTC RTCRVICES IN THE... SEVENTIES67.   Long-term planning is essential in defence.   an advanced weapons-system may take up to ten years from itsconception to enter service and in some cases may then havea further twenty years of operational life.    If we are tohave forces with the right balance of skills and ages, capableof giving a worthwhile return on their expensive training, we need a stable long-term programme for manpower and recruiting.To some extent the decision to concentrate Britain&apos;s forcesin Europe has narrowed the area of choice and the scope forerror in long-term defence planning.    But substantialuncertainties remain, particularly in the fluidity of theinternational situation, the development of militarytechnology, and the allocation of roles as between allies.In these circumstances,the Government must strike a balance between the best  estimate it can now make of Britain&apos;sprobable defence requirements and the degree of flexibilitywe can afford as an insurance against the inevitablefallibility of judgement.Outside Europe68.   So long as Britain is responsible for dependent territories, she will have certain military obligations whichwill require her to station small elements of all three services overseas - for example in Hong Kong - and to reinforcethem if necessary.    She may also wish to co-operate in keeping the peace imder United Nations1 auspices    or to support herfriends.   Thus, although the Government has decided toretain no special capability for major operations overseas,Britain must preserve some of the special military skillswhich might be needed there and imiQt keep the ability tosend her forces outside Europe if she judges it her duty or:interest to do so.   We plan to keep the use of Gan andMasirah in order to maintain a number of route options,/69.....
69,   Though most of Britain.1 s forces in the Ettropean theatrewill be committed to NATO in one way or another and thenormal consultation with NATO would be required before theywere withdrawn for other purposes, this formal commitment is unlikely to prevent our sending appropriate forces overseasunless conditions in Western Europe made such deploymentobvioiisly   undesirable.   The forces that Britain might decide to make available overseas would depend on the natureof the operation concerned and the circumstances at the time,and on the political implications of temporarily reducing our NATO   contribution for the duration of that operation.While it would conflict with Britain&apos;s now political priori-ties to deploy more than a relatively small part of her total strength outside Europe, we could, if in our judgment thesituation so demanded, still provide a considerable force ofall three Services.   Indeed one purpose of the Five PowerCommonwealth exercise proposed for the Par East in 1970 isto demonstrate that Britain is in fact able to deployeffectively substantial forces overseas.70.   Such forces could include a substantial number of navalships, an amphibious force, several squadrons of combat aircraft of various types, and a land force of at leastbrigade group size.   Deployment timings would obviouslydepend upon the precise circumstances but we could expect navaland air forces and lightly armed ground troops to be quickly on the scene, although it would obviously takelonger to build up the support facilities and supplies requiredfor a major operation.    In general,we do not propose tomaintain stockpiles  of operational equipment and suppliesoutside Europe, though we may find it economical to hold smallstocks of equipment for training or exercises: in areasregularly used for these purposes.   We  already do this;in some parts of the world.
PQ71,   it will be a necessary part of our policy that our forces should train overseas in peace time.   Such training is already undertaken on a considerable     scale in many parts of the world.It will be even more important to continue this for thefollowing reasons.   Our forces must remain experienced and efficient.   We must overcome the limitations of, andfamiliarity with, the training areas In this country.   Wemust preserve our present operational techniques and skill indifferent climates and terrains and our ability to assist inpeace keeping overseas.   Finally, we must give servicementhe opportunity to serve overseas,  at least for short periods; this is, and always has been, one of the attractionsof Service life and is of     importance to the maintenance of voluntary recruiting.   Where practicable, our military trainingoverseas will be so arranged as to enable projects e.g.road construction, which are of direct benefit to the localpeoples, to be carried out at the same time.The role in Europe72.   In defence, as in every other field, the first and fundamental assumption   on which the Government believes that britain must base her future policy is the need for closerunity in Europe.   By the end of 1971 the concentration of our forces in the NATO area will be used to strengthen not onlythe military power of the Alliance but also the politicalsolidarity of the European members of NATO.    Closerintegration in defence between Britain and the european allies within the Altantic Alliance is likely to be of equalbenefit whether early progress can be made towards disarmamentor not.   It can also bring both military and economic advantages,through joint procurement of defence equipment.Moreover, so long as other elements in tie European situationare unstable, anything which reinforces the stability of security relationships between the powers must strengthenpeace.
73..     It is difficult at present to determine in detailwhat forces Europe is likely to require for its security in the longer term or how they should he deployed.     Thiswill depend among other things on what progress can he made towards disarmament and on what contribution is madeby Europe&apos;s trans-Atlantic allies.     We cannot expect thatthe United States, with its heavy burden of defence commitments in other areas, will be able indefinitely tomaintain at the present level its contribution to the defencof Europe on   the   ground. If Britain wishes to exer-cise the same influence as other European powers of similarresources in a Europe which is expected to become increas-ingly self-reliant, she must be prepared to continue con-tributing to its joint defence on a scale comparable withthem.7k*     It is, therefore,  the Government&apos;s intention that britain shall play her full part in the defence of Europe.Her all-regular Army, though smaller in size than someContinental armies, will provide the Alliance with ground forces of a professional skill and experience unmatchedin Europe.     Her air force will compare in size and quality with that of any other European power.     With thetransfer of the strategic nuclear role to the Royal navy the primary role of the RAP will be,  in conjunction withthe air forces of our NATO allies to establish an air situation favourable to the conduct of operations by landor sea.     Britain&apos;s Polaris force will be the onlyEuropean contribution to the strategic nuclear deterrentfrom this side of the Atlantic;   the British Navy as awhole will be by far the strongest navy in Europe - a contribution particularly appropriate for an islandnation.
75.     During the past decade, the future of the Serviceshas been uncertain.     The decision, however, to withdrawand ourfrom our main bases overseas,/improved methods of con-trolling the defence budget and of deciding what military-equipment the forces will need have reduced the mainuncertainties in our planning.     The next few years will see a major redeployment in the Services.     Once this hasbeen completed, and our forces are based in and on Europe,the Services can look forward with increasing confidence to a more stable future.     The Government believes thatthe Armed Forces offer a stimulating, worthwhile andenduring career.     m the future, as in the past, theywill make an indispensable contribution to the nation&apos;s security, and the peace of the world.
ANNEX AT?TVE PCFER CONFERENCE AT KUALA LUMPUR - COMMUNIQUEOn 10th and 11th June, 1968, at the invitation cfY.T.M. Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra, Prime Minister of malaysia, delegations from the Governments of Australia,Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and the United Kingdommet in Kuala Lumpur to discuss defence problems arisingfrom the decision to withdraw British forces fromMalaysia and Singapore by 31st December, 1971.     Thefollowing Ministers attended:   for Australia, the R.T., Hon. P.M.C. Hasluck and the Hon. A Fairhall;   forMalaysia, the Hon. Tun Abdul Rasak (Chairman of theConference) and the Hon. Tun Tan Siew Sin;    for NewZealand, the Rt. Hon. K.J. Holyoake and the Hon. D.S.Thomson;   for Singapore, the Hon. Dr. Goh Keng Swee andthe Hon. Mr. Lim Kim San;    and for the United Kingdom,the Rt. Hon. D.W. Healey, and the Rt. Hon. G.M. Thomson.2.     Tunku Abdul Rahman welcomed the visiting delegationsand made a general statement on behalf of the Governmentof Malaysia.3.     The five countries concerned reaffirmed at the outsettheir continuing interest in the peace and stability ofthe area and declared their intention to maintain close co-operation among themselves.     The discussions of theConference proceeded on that basis.k.     The United Kingdom delegation described the plannedprogramme for the rundown and withdrawal of British forces and drew attention to the substantial defence facilities and surplus non-operational equipment that would be madeavailable free to Malaysia and Singapore for both defence and economic purposes.     They also described in outlinethe form which their continuing interest might take after1971.5.     A general exchange of views followed.M
ANNEX A   (Contd.)-2-6.     The representatives of Singapore and Malaysiadeclared that the defence of the two countries wasindivisible and required close and continuing co-opera-tion between them.     This declaration was welcomed by therepresentatives of the other three Governments,,     Allrepresentatives at the Conference regarded it as an indispensable basis for future defence co-operation.The representatives of Malaysia and Singapore said thattheir Governments were resolved to do their utmost fortheir own defence and they would welcome the co-operation and assistance of the other three Governments.7.     The Conference went on to discuss some of thepractical defence problems that would result from theBritish rundown including the assistance that Malaysia and singapore would require in developing an effective joint defence system.      In doing so they drew upon reportsprepared by Advisory Working Groups,  set up by theCommander-in-Chief, Par East,  in which officers from thefive countries had participated.8.     The Conference recognised that an integrated air defence system covering both Malaysia and Singapore was required and agreed that the Air Defence Advisory working group should study the form of the integrated control and management of such a system.     They also discussed the elements which the system might comprise and the phasing of the necessary action and authorised further detailed examination by the Air Defence Advisory working Group.The Singapore delegation outlined their governments plans to raise an air force which would contribute to ajoint air defence system;   this would include a squadron of Hunter Mark 9 fighters to become operational prior tothe completion of the British withdrawal.     The Australian/delegation
ANNEX  A  (Contd.)-3-delegation indicated that as a contribution to an integratedair defence system, Australia would be prepared to providea Royal Australian Air Force component based on Butterworthwith elements deployed to Tengah;    the arrangements to operate beyond 1971 would depend on decisions to be takenby the Australian Government on the part which australia would play in the defence of the area after that date.The United Kingdom delegation stated that in addition tothe part that would continue to be played by Royal AirForce elements of the system up to the time of their with-drawal, the United Kingdom Government would be prepared tomake available the necessary ground facilities,  includingairfields, radar and communications facilities and ground-to-air defence equipment.     They would also assist in thedevelopment of the new arrangements by providing training and, to the extent that this proved to be necessary and practicable, by the provision of specialist personnel on loan to the other Commonwealth Services concerned.9.       In the sphere of naval defence, the Conference notedthe intentions of the Malaysian and Singapore governments to develop forces which would co-operate effectively in coastal defence;   the agreement of the Singapore Governmentthat the Royal Malaysian Navy continue to use theWoodlands Naval Base and such other facilities in singapore as might be agreed;    and the intentions of both governments to agree on arrangements for controlling after 1971 what are now known as the &quot;Naval Base Waters&quot;.     The conference agreed that the Naval Advisory Working Group should make recommendations for the retention and operation of navalfacilities in the area after 1971 in the light of therequirements of the Governments concerned.
ANNEX A   (Contd. )10,     Turning to army matters, the Conference agreed thatit was desirable that there should be joint exercises inthe area after 1971, and to facilitate this agreed inprinciple that there should be joint exercise planningmachinery and a jungle warfare training school on a multi-national basis.     These matters would be further studied bythe Army Advisory Working Group,11.     In the context of a discussion on the ability of theUnited Kingdom Government to deploy forces in the areaafter 1971, the Conference agreed that there should be a major exercise in 1970 in which all five countries would participate.     They noted that British participation would include a major reinforcement exercise from the UnitedKingdom,     It was further noted that the United KingdomGovernment also intended to continue training and exercisingBritish forces in the area after 1971.12.     The Malaysian delegation indicated that, in the lightof the commitments and contributions by the otherGovernments, their Government would be prepared to consideradditional contributions over and above the present strength of their Armed Forces which were already a sub-stantial contribution to joint defence,13.     The Conference noted that a new understanding aboutthe Anglo-Malaysian Defence Agreement would be necessaryin due course.     To this end, there would be jointconsultations at a later stage,1U.     The Australian and New Zealand delegations observedthat their Governments would take into account theproceedings of the Conference in formulating their longer-term defence policies, and in deciding what part their forces would play in the collective defence and combined training/arrangements
^5- ANNEX A  CContd.)arrangements which the Conference had discussed.     Mean-while they would continue to maintain forces in the area and to assist the Governments of Malaysia and Singaporein the development of their forces by means of assistancein training, personnel and defence aid.15.     Representatives regarded the Conference as havingpointed the way to further co-operation of a practicalkind.     They reaffirmed their determination to live inharmony with the other countries of the region.     they believed that their co-operative efforts in defence arrangements and in promoting economic and social develop-ment contributed to security and stability in South-east asia.16.     The Ministers considered that the present conference was only the first of joint Ministerial consultations among them on the questions arising out of British military with-drawal and on the larger questions of their continuinginterest in the peace and stability of the area.     they felt that their discussions had been extremely useful and agreed that they would meet again in the first half of1969.Kuala Lumpur11th June,  1968.
