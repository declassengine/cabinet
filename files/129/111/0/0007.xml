Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1962C. (62) 15716th October, 1962CABINETPOPULATION  AND  EMPLOYMENTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department i present this interim report as Chairman of the Population and employment committees.  Our terms of reference are &quot; to consider major questions relating to the pattern of employment and population in Great Britain.&quot;We have been looking to the future, long term and short term. This is what wehave seen.Population trends2. The population of Great Britain is now 51 million. It grew in the decade1951-61 by 2-4 million, or 4-9 per cent. But the growth was unevenly spread.In the Midlands it was 7 - 5 per cent.; in the South-East 7 - 3 per cent.; in the South-West 5-5 per cent. But in the North of England it was only 2-2 per cent., andin Scotland and Wales as little as 1 - 6 per cent.3. But now look forward twenty years, to 1981. There will be, according tothe best estimates, over 6 million more people in the country than there are now,all needing somewhere to live. If present trends continue, three-quarters of theaddition will be in the Midlands, the South-East and the South-West; onlyone-quarter in the North, Scotland and Wales.4. An extra 6 million people in this island means some  6,000 million tobe spent in social investment somewhere, with far-reaching consequences, social and economic. This in a country where the social and economic scene will bechanging too.5. The problem is not simply one of drift to the South-East. Migrationsouth-eastward is the undercurrent. The tide is natural increase, in every region.In the North, Scotland and Wales migration to other regions is partly offsettingnatural increase. In other regions it is augmenting natural increase; and so isimmigration from overseas.6. This is not to say that internal migration can be ignored. For theSouth-East, which already houses 17-7 million people and faces in the nexttwenty years an addition of \\ million by natural increase and perhaps \ million by immigration from overseas, the further increase of \ million by migration fromother regions may seem relatively small, but on top of the rest it may be thelast straw. Conversely, Scotland with a present population of a little over  million must naturally regard the loss by migration of \ million every ten years as a serious matter.7. In addition to this there are likely to be big movements of populationwithin regions in order to relieve congestion in the big cities, involving programmes of new and expanded towns and provision of the necessary employment.Employment trends8. There are trends too in the character of employment. The older basic industries are declining. In the coalfields the effect is to deprive whole areas ofan important element in their economy, and even to remove the traditionallivelihood of towns which are often situated where they are, sometimes in remoteSECRET1504 A.Copy No.   4STHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
places, simply because of the coal that was underneath. There are similar featuresin the decline of textile industries, though in Lancashire at least this has beenoffset by the growth of new employment nearby. Particular cities and towns areor will be hit by the decline in shipbuilding and marine engineering. Some townsmay be affected more than others by contraction in railway employment, thoughthe effect in this case may be more diffused.C t 9. The growing industries of the past 10 years have tended to have their homes in the South-East and Midlands; notably the car industry. When these have been growing, their off-shoots have established themselves successfully inother towns, often in relatively remote development districts. How far we canbank upon this process continuing or indeed accelerating will largely dependon what the growing industries of the next decades will prove to be. Study ofthis is in progress.10. There is, then, and is likely to continue to be a relative glut ofemployment in parts of the country, and a relative scarcity elsewhere. The figuresof unemployment bear this out.  The rates (as at 10th September, 1962) are Percentage PercentageLondon and South-East ... 1-2 East and West Ridings    ... 1-8Eastern and Southern    ... 1-4 North-West.......     ... 2-south-West ......... 1-6 Northern    ......... -3-8Midland      ...      ...... 1-8 Scotland     ...      ...... 3-north Midland     ...... 1-4 Wales         .......... 3-2-In terms of arithmetic, the gain in employed manpower that would be obtainedif unemployment rates in Yorkshire, the North-Western and Northern regions,Scotland and Wales could be brought down to the level prevailing in South-east england is estimated at about 130,000. But it is not evident that it would besensible to go as far as this, since to do so would be to spread more widely theconditions of over-full employment and attendant inflation now affecting theSouth-East. But there is a further consideration, that in the areas of relativescarcity of labour higher proportions of men over 65 and of women are atwork; and if work could be provided on a scale that would attract similarproportions in the less well-off regions, the country&apos;s labour force would in theorybe further increased by some 66,000 men and 413,000 women (admittedlymany part-time). This too is arithmetic, and it might not be practicable to draw so many into employment; some, for instance, might be living too far from centres of employment. But at a time when we all are aiming at steady economic growth,should such resources by lying unused?11. The drift from the land into urban employment continues. It might evenaccelerate (especially since the South-East, Southern and Eastern Regions, whereother jobs are likely to be plentiful, have no less than 37 per cent, of all employees in agriculture and horticulture in Great Britain); it would certainly do so if for any reason British farming became less remunerative.12. Moreover, there are powerful forces, apart altogether from the location of manufacturing industry, which stimulate the movement of population to theSouth-East. Less than half the total working population is employed in manufacturing and mining. The problem of Central London is hardly one ofindustry at all. In London, especially the rapid growth of office employment is theimportant factor. In Central London, the rate has been 15,000 new office jobs ayear, this rate would produce 300,000 extra jobs in Central London by 1980, plusjobs for perhaps another 70,000 to feed and serve them. Again, the personalpreferences of people who are not employed at all, but retired, accounts for a significant part of the influx to the southern counties; and the scale of suchmovement will grow with the rising proportion of aged people and their greaterprosperity.The future pattern13. To sum up, the problems ahead of us vary from region to region, as wellas from place to place. In some areas, e.g., Scotland, we face a relatively high levelof unemployment, spread widely over whole counties and communities. This isin spite of the probability of continuing migration southwards, which will not onlyprovoke criticism of the Government but will also, because of the high proportionof skilled men among the migrants, make further development in these areas moredifficult. Where for instance a colliery has been the only, or the dominant, employer
SECRET3and can no longer survive, a whole community may find itself without employment.Elsewhere, for instance in Glasgow or in the towns of the North-&apos;East coast, seriouslocal unemployment may arise from contraction of heavy engineering and shipbuilding; and new industry may be shy of going to areas with aggrieved labour,poor housing and indifferent amenities. Elsewhere again, for instance in birmingham, the problem is the different one of ample employment and thrivingand diversified industry, but old and overcrowded housing alongside modern,subsidised housing estates, with not nearly enough land for new housebuildingwithin the city boundaries; the contrast and the overcrowding worsening aspopulation increases and local industry thrives and attracts more immigrants fromthe rest of Britain and overseas.14. In London we have this contrast in its starkest form. Office employmentgrows; other employment is created to serve it; the extra workers are added to theli million commuting daily in much discomfort to Central London; meanwhile theresidential population in the built-up area within the London Green Belt declines,people move further out to find housing and are added to the longer distancecommuters. It is estimated that if present trends continue they will by 1980, addmore than another half a million people to the daily load of commuters into central london and adjacent areas served by the main rail termini. At a capital cost ofsome  100 million improvements on the railways into Central London could bemade to enable them to carry an extra 210,000 people a day, assuming that thesame proportion as now would travel outside peak hours, that standing passengerswould be carried up to the physical limits of the trains that is, that one in threewould stand, as against one in ten now and that land could be found to houseworkers in the areas from which the surface and underground railways could provide additional carrying capacity. Within Central London improvements toowould be needed for enabling all the extra commuters to get to their destinations.Beyond that 210,000 major new capital works would be needed to increase the capacity of the public transport system, and increased use of cars would onlyaggravate the problem by jamming the roads. The Ministry of Transport considerthat, at a very rough guess, the cost of a new generation of capital works might beof the order of  1,000 million, and that even this might prove to be a considerableunder-estimate, if the number of commuters grows as forecast. Large new investment would almost certainly entail increases in fares, and while this might tendto reduce the attraction of employment that involved commuting it would at thesame time worsen the lot of the commuter. In the meantime, the shortage of landfor housing would be growing worse, land values would be rising still higher on each side of the Green Belt and the pressure to open it up for building would be intensified. Because of shortage of land for housing, the number of inner London&apos;shomeless would grow as the prosperity of their city increased, and the relief nowhoped for from overspill schemes would be nullified by the increase in jobs with no possibility of a corresponding increase in housing at the centre. Congestionwould spread to the dormitory areas beyond the Green Belt, since they would, of necessity, crowd around the railway stations. It would not help that population in the country areas between the dormitory towns might be as sparse as in many more distant counties.Our approach15. The Committee has so far concentrated upon four aspects of these problems:(i) London travel.(ii) LOndon offices.(iii) Local unemployment prospects in the next three years.(iv) Groundwork for policy in the future.The first three are immediate; the fourth looks further ahead but is none the lessurgent. If we want to influence the pattern of the 1970s we must set the course in1962-63; and decisions are needed quickly if slum clearance and overspill schemes are not to be held up.London travel16. The Committee considered and supported the proposal by the Ministerof Transport to proceed with the new Victoria tube, connecting Victoria withEuston and King&apos;s Cross, via Green Park, Oxford Circus and Warren Street, and
continuing to Walthamstow. The estimated capital cost is  65 million. Althoughthe line will bring some people in from the suburbs, its main value will lie insupplementing existing transport between the main railway terminals and places of work which is already very overloaded. Clearly it cannot contribute to the wider problems of housing and longer distance commuting summarised inparagraph 14.London offices17. We have thought it right to explore first whether the demand shouldbe allowed to grow naturally or whether the Government should act to restrain the apparently unending growth of new employment in Central London. Thisquestion has been discussed both in the Home Affairs Committee and the economic policy Committee. The Home Affairs Committee were agreed on the importanceof bringing the growth of offices under control. In the Economic Policy Committeea minority took the view that new restraints were undesirable, and there is asimilar difference of opinion in the Population and Employment Committee. I amputting the Committee&apos;s views before my colleagues in the Cabinet in a separate paper (C. (62) 158).Local unemployment in the next three years18. We have considered the localities in which unemployment is likely to beor to become serious in the next three years, and the extent to which present policies might prove inadequate to check that.  On the assumptions that:(i) three years hence the unemployment rate will average 1 - 8 per cent., and(ii) recent trends in the number of insured employees in each area and in thenumbers in employment will continue, subject to the &quot; bulge &quot; and toknown contractions in mining and the railways, as well as to allowances for new jobs in prospect,our conclusions are that we do not foresee the emergence of any new area of high unemployment in this period, and that in Central Scotland and North-east england, where the crux of the problem will probably be, the unemployment situation may not change radically either for better or worse (in mid-September1962 unemployment in Central Scotland stood at 64,688 (3-9 per cent.), and in north-East England 46,034 (3-9 per cent.). Merseyside, where unemployment in mid-September 1962 was 29,602 (4-8 per cent.), could possibly be a difficult area,but is particularly unpredictable because so much depends on the degree of migration. The other main unemployment area is West South Wales (where unemployment in mid-September 1962 was 6,434 (5-4 per cent.)) but this is likelyto show a considerable improvement by 1965. Our assumption of a national average of 1-8 per cent, unemployment may of course be falsified in eitherdirection.19. In addition we note three types of pockets of high local unemployment:towns, such as the Hartlepools in Durham and the Cowdenbeath, Dumbarton,Greenock and Kirkcaldy areas in Scotland, which may be worse affected than theareas of relatively high unemployment around them; communities, such as theWest Durham mining villages and some places in North Lanarkshire and in theSouth Wales mining valleys, deprived of employment by the ebb of industry fromthe mineral areas; and isolated towns such as Stranraer, Ilfracombe or Portmadoc,that are handicapped by their sheer isolation.20. As for the adequacy of existing policies, we are impressed by the successv/hich the existing distribution of industry policy has had, when times have been favourable, in steering industry to development districts by means of the local employment Act, 1960. Between April 1960 and August 1962 the Exchequercommitted  41 million to projects to provide 30,000 new jobs in Scotland and 4 million to provide 9.000 new jobs in the North-East. This is, of course,relatively slow in operation; it takes time to obtain land and build factories. Butwe are concurrently impressed by the fact that, broadly speaking, it is only in aboom that industries have occasion to seek new premises and can thus be influenced by the policy. On the other hand, it is precisely because of local boomconditions, mainly in the South-East and Midlands, that the Government has hadon occasion to adopt national disinflationary measures; and such measures hitrelatively depressed areas twice over, by aggravating their own state and by cutting off the source from which relief might have come.
SECRET521. This is not to be read as criticism of existing policy. It is simply astatement of the limits within which that policy has to work. The significant fact is that the usefulness of the Local Employment Act depends heavily upon the rateof growth of industry. Subject to this, and subject to any expedients that canbe devised in particular localities, there is little that can now be done, by meansof our existing policies to alter the situation described in paragraphs 18 and 19within the next three years, even though that period may see other projects beingannounced and started which will bear fruit later. In this connexion the Presidentof the Board of Trade is working out a further programme of advance factories.Groundwork for policy in the future22. How are we to rectify the present unbalance, where shortage of labour in some areas can force us to put the brake on the economy and in the processpenalise other areas where labour is already too plentiful ? How are we to securethe full use of our economic resources throughout the whole country? How can we do all this without interfering with industry&apos;s own preferences in choice oflocation to such an extent as to damage the very process of growth on which thesuccess even of our present policies depends? The task is to seek new ways ofchannelling economic growth so that it relieves social problems without growthbeing weakened: to consider whether, as thousands of millions of pounds are tobe spent in any case, there are ways of spending them to better economic and social effect, with greater growth and reduced local waste of resources, than under existing policies.23. One view is that we should contemplate nothing which might imposeadditional charges or costs on particular businesses, lest their ability to competein world markets be impaired. The corollary is that if this leads to furtherindustrial and commercial development in the South-East and the Midlands, theconsequences should be accepted. Among these consequences would be new investment in housing, transport and services in those regions not necessarilyuneconomic investment, even in terms of direct revenue, and not necessarilyadditional to that which would be required elsewhere if these developments didnot take place; there may be a period of congestion to be faced while the services are built up; there will be pressure for incursions into Green Belt land; and someof us would also expect a slower rate of growth, or even a gradual decline, inother areas, excepting so far as existing distribution of industry policy couldreverse such tendencies.24. Another view is that such consequences cannot be accepted or risked,and that, even at some risk in other directions, new policies must be developed.It has been suggested that we should seek to set in operation &quot; natural&quot; economicforces in an opposite direction to the pull of the South-East, by providing newattractive environments for industry outside the Midlands and South-East. Thiswould imply developing centres of population and industry &quot; growing points &quot; at places and in conditions in which they would be attractive to industry or business in their own right. A &quot;tough&quot; policy of refusing industrial developmentcertificates in the congested areas would have to be maintained, perhapssupplemented by some form of control over the re-use of vacated factory space;and a comparable restraint on office employment will, on this view, be needed.But instead of trying to use this solely to force industry to go to development districts (some of which may be inherently unattractive) we would permit and indeed encourage industry to go to new centres, not by direct financial assistance(except perhaps for an initial period) but by making those centres economicallyattractive (as most of the New Towns are). Labour would likewise be encouraged to move from the high unemployment areas to these new centres. It might entaillessening the prospects of some parts of development districts, since the moreindustry that was absorbed by the new centres the less there would be to goelsewhere. But this is not to say that it would be any the less effective as anantidote to unemployment even to local unemployment. On the contrary, someof us think that it would be more effective, and see in it also the answer to theproblem of pressing home our overspill policy.25. To broaden the application of this idea, we might develop a number of concentrated &quot; growth &quot; centres, both North and South. These would be of two main kinds (i). those primarily to relieve regional unemployment (e.g., Scotland,the North, Northern Ireland and Wales); (ii) those primarily to deal with overspill
programmes (e.g., the South-East, West Midlands, the North-West). Some of these&quot; growth &quot; centres might well be in key positions for trade with the common market. The aims would be to relieve unemployment more effectively, to holdpopulation in the declining areas to a greater extent, to bring about greater mobility of industry and to provide enough industry for the big overspill programmes in thevarious regions. The priorities and weighting as between the various developmentcentres at any one time would need consideration and management. Much wouldalso depend on how successful a policy of this kind was in encouraging moreindustry to move. The hope would be that by offering a greater variety of choice of centres in themselves inherently attractive and being intensively developed we might succeed in getting greater industrial growth and mobility. Though a policyof this kind would certainly have its difficulties it might well offer a constructiveapproach to the problems of growth, unemployment and overspill. It is of coursenot essential that the working-out of policy should be identical on both sides ofthe Border, and it should be borne in mind that the application of this policy inthe South would have a bearing on its success in Scotland.26. We are not yet ready to make recommendations. We need to studyfurther the main kinds of industry that would be concerned; what kind ofenvironment they would need; how readily labour of the right kinds might befound; what sites, broadly, might be suitable; what pattern of transport wouldbe available or would need to be provided; what scale of investment would be involved; and what the net effect might be on the development districts. research on these and other points is in hand, under our supervision, and we have asked the research teams for ideas, however radical.27. Already we believe that the existence of the Committee is serving a useful purpose in co-ordinating the work and concentrating the thinking of thedifferent Government Departments which, each from their own angle, are concernedwith the powerful population and employment trends, regional and national,identified in the opening paragraphs of this paper. In the light of research results which should be available within the next two months, we hope then to decide whether or not to recommend to the Cabinet further developments of policy.Meanwhile, we think that our colleagues may like to have this progress report,and we should welcome any views on it.H.
