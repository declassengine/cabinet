CABINETFASCIST ACTIVITIES AND PUBLIC order memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department in the House of Commons on 2nd August I undertook to consider during the recess whether amending legislation was necessary to deal with the threat to public order arising out of the activities of the three Fascist organisations (Hansard,columns 795-804). The Government will be expected to announce their intentionswhen the House reassembles.2.   The problem resolves itself into three inter-related questions:(a) Is any amendment of the law necessary?(b) If so, what form should it take?(c) The question of timing.(a) Is any amendment of the law necessary?3. The freedom to hold processions and meetings and to express opinionsboth orally and in print (so long as what is said or written is not seditious,blasphemous, obscene or likely to lead to a breach of the peace) has been regardedas fundamental to our democratic system. The existence of this freedom is, in fact,one of the main distinctions between that system and the totalitarian regimes basedon Fascist and Communist doctrines; and restriction of it ought not, therefore, tobe contemplated unless the case for it is compelling. It is indeed the pride of thiscountry that minorities, however small, have the right to express whatever viewsthey wish, however unpopular or distasteful to the vast majority subject to no restriction other than that it must not lead to a breach of the peace.4. The law was last strengthened in 1936 by the Public Order Act of that year,which was passed to deal with disorders that in themselves were far more serious than the present ones. It proved effective for its purpose. The position has,however, changed since 1936 in two important respects: ((i) there is now a much larger coloured population in the country and, therefore, in crowded areas wherethey are concentrated, a much more inflammable situation; and (ii) television givesimmediate nation-wide publicity even to quite minor disorders. We must alsokeep in mind that the persecution suffered by millions of Jews before and duringthe war makes propaganda of the type now being put about by the so-calledNational Socialist Movement to the effect that &quot; Hitler was right&quot; particularlyinflammatory to our large Jewish population.5. The demand for some strengthening of the present law originated from theconsequences of the publicity given beforehand by Colin Jordan the leader ofthe National Socialist Movement to an avowedly anti-Semitic meeting inTrafalgar Square, on 1st July. This is one of two extremist splinter groups theother is John Bean&apos;s British Nationalist Party which broke away from Mosley&apos;union Movement, largely in consequence of Mosley denying that there would beanything anti-Semitic about the Union Movement henceforward. The union movement has about 900 members, and each of the other two between 300 and 400.Their members have been holding meetings for years without attracting attentionTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.

or causing disorder. On 1st July disorder was caused by Jordan&apos;s well-publicisedanti-Semitic meeting. Such disorder as has been subsequently caused by Mosley&apos;organisation has been the result not of anything he has said he is not now attacking the Jews or preaching racial prejudice but of his holding meetings in areas wherethe mere presence of a man with his record is provocative. In Jordan&apos;s case therecan be said to have been provocation both in what he has said and in the pamphletsand leaflets he has published. A case against him under the Public Order Act inrespect of what he said on 1st July in Trafalgar Square is still under appeal; but inrespect of his pamphlets and leaflets he could, under the law as it stands, be prosecuted only for seditious libel, and this has not hitherto been found possible.6. Such disorders as have occurred have been very largely the result ofCommunists and young trouble-makers deliberately breaking up meetings. Thepolice have dealt firmly with the situation, and advise me that they consider their present powers to be adequate. They say that the disorders have been ona small scale, and that amendment of the law is not required on public ordergrounds. I can see objections in principle to legislation to suppress a point ofview-however deplorable because those who are opposed to it have chosen to cause disorder as a means of preventing its expression. The strongestpractical ground in favour of amendment is in my view that, if the law werefurther strengthened against the Fascist bodies, those who are breaking up their meetings would have no excuse left to them for doing so and would forfeit allpublic sympathy if they did. At present we have the undesirable situation that(because everyone hates Mosley) public opinion is generally on the side of thebreakers-up, though they are directly responsible for starting the acts of violence.(b) If so, what form should it take?7. Legislation could take several forms, briefly considered in the following paragraphs:(i) An increase in the available penalties.(ii) An amendment of section 5 of the Public Order Act.(iii) A more general provision making incitement to racial hatred illegal.(iv) Power to ban public meetings in certain circumstances.8. As to (i), the maximum penalty for an offence against section 5 of thePublic Order Act, 1936 (which makes it an offence to use in a public placethreatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour in circumstances likely to cause a breach of the peace), is a fine of  50 and / or three months&apos; imprisonment.The maximum penalty for an offence under the Public Meetings Act, 1908 (which makes it an offence to act in a disorderly manner at a public meeting for thepurpose of preventing the transaction of the business for which the meeting was called together), is a fine of  5 or one month&apos;s imprisonment. Fines whichwere appropriate in 1936 and 1908 are, prima facie, inadequate to-day; and legislation substantially increasing them might also encourage the courts to takea serious view of cases brought before them where the offender is proved to have broken the law. A Bill for these purposes would almost certainly have general support, but if introduced in the present atmosphere it would be widely criticised as not going far enough.9.   As to (ii), Mr. Iremonger introduced a Bill before the Recess to amendsection 5 of the Public Order Act by inserting the words in italics:&quot; Any person who in any public place or at any public meeting usesthreatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour or words incitinghatred of any racial group of Her Majesty&apos;s subjects with intent to provoke a breach of the peace or whereby a breach of the peace is likely to beoccasioned, shall be guilty of an offence.&quot;This proposal has evoked considerable sympathy among some government supporters, though it has been attacked by others. The doubt in my mind is whether it would in practice add anything to existing powers. Any words used at a meeting to incite to racial hatred could hardly avoid being in the terms ofthe existing section 5 &quot; threatening, abusive or insulting &quot;, and so exposing theperson using them to prosecution under the law as it stands. Moreover, such an amendment would not touch offensive written matter, such as Jordan&apos;s notorious&quot; Hitler was right &quot; leaflet; nor would it catch Mosley, who now is careful to refrain in his public utterances from abusive or insulting references to the Jews.
10. As to (iii), a more general enactment making incitement to racial hatredillegal might take one of two forms. We could restate and bring up to date thelaw relating to seditious libel, which at present appears to me to be ineffective. ABill of this kind would open a wide field to debate, and for that reason among othersit might prove to be acutely controversial. Alternatively, we could simply makeit an offence in any public place or at any public meeting to use words intended topromote hatred towards any section of the public on grounds of race, or to publish,display or distribute any notice, sign or circular containing words or other matterso intended. This would probably be much less controversial, but by no meanswithout difficulties:(a) There would be difficulties of definition and interpretation.   How should&quot; race &quot; be defined and interpreted? It might be held to apply to theScots, the Irish and the Welsh, as well as the English. And what would constitute &quot; incitement to hatred &quot;? Could, for instance, exuberantremarks on St. Patricks Day or Burns&apos; Night be prevented from giving rise to prosecutions?(b) There might be difficulties of enforcement.   Once one gets away from the criterion of &quot; words which are likely to cause a breach of the peace &quot;,what sort of criterion is to be applied?(c) The legislation would be of no effect against Mosley (though, as pointed outin paragraph 6 above, it would swing public opinion against those whoare now maintaining that the only way to silence him is by violence).11. As to- (iv), we could take powers to regulate public meetings similar tothose for the regulation of processions contained in section 3 of the Public OrderAct. That section enables the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis to make an order, and the chief officer of police elsewhere to ask the appropriate localauthority to make an order in both cases subject to my consent prohibiting fora period of up to three months in a specified area processions likely to occasionserious public disorder. These may be processions of all kinds or of a particularclass. As the law stands at present in relation to meetings, the police can bring a meeting to a close or stop it at the very outset if, in the judgment of the officerpresent at the place where the meeting is to be held, disorder is likely to occur.In certain circumstances, too, persons who hold meetings in public places at whichthey use language calculated to cause a breach of the peace may be required, underthe Justices of the Peace Act, 1361, to enter into recognisances to keep the peace and to be of good behaviour. But to prohibit a set of people in advance, on general grounds, from holding a meeting for the expression of their political views wouldtake us into very deep waters. It is true that they can be prevented, under existing powers, from holding their meeting in certain places under the control of theGovernment, but that does not prevent them from holding the meeting somewhereelse instead.The question of timing12. Two cases against Jordan and his associates which are still sub judicehave a very important bearing on the matter. In my view one will not be able tosay how far, if at all, the existing law is deficient until they are finally settled. Thereare two distinct charges:(a) Jordan and Tyndall were charged under section 5 of the Public Order Actwith using at their Trafalgar Square meeting on 1st July threatening,abusive or insulting words whereby a breach of the peace was likely tobe occasioned. They were convicted by the magistrates, but Jordan&apos;s appeal was allowed at the London Sessions. The case has now gone to the Divisional Court, whose decision is not expected much before christmas, if then.   It may go to the House of Lords.(b) Jordan, Tyndall and two others of his associates were charged undersection 2 of the Public Order Act with running a quasi-military organisation and have just been convicted and sentenced. They have declared their intention of appealing.Until these cases are finally disposed of, we have good reason for declining to cometo any final decision on the question of altering the law.
Conclusion13. We are faced with a situation where we may (or may not) have a continuing series of Fascist meetings broken up by violence; and wherever such ameeting has been advertised in advance, the television cameras will be there. If thispersists and the Government are not seen to be doing anything to stop it, the wholeJewish population, and many others too, will turn against us. There is a risk thatthe flame might spread to areas of London, Birmingham and elsewhere where there&quot;is-a large coloured population; a few trouble-makers in such an area could start avery big explosion, far worse than any Fascist meeting could spark off. As we shallbe asked our intentions the moment Parliament reassembles, we must considerwithout delay the provisional position which we should take up at this stage,bearing in mind that there ultimately appear to be three courses open to us:(a) To take no action, defending this on the ground that the threat to public order from these insignificant bodies can be dealt with under the law asit stands and that no adequate case for placing further restrictions onour traditional freedom of speech and assembly has been made out.(b) To introduce a Bill to increase the penalties under the Acts of 1908 and1936 (perhaps indicating that this is not necessarily the Governmentslast word if later events prove that further strengthening of the law isnecessary).(c) To introduce a Bill increasing the penalties under the Acts of 1908 and 1936  iand making incitement to racial hatred, in publications or speech, a criminal offence.14. I should welcome the views of my colleagues. My own recommendation is that in the debate on the Address we should say that until the cases now subjudice are decided it is impossible to hold that the present law is inadequate:that we shall review the situation in the light of the decisions on those cases, andif the law should then be shown to be inadequate, we shall give that immediateattention. Meanwhile we think there is a case for increasing the penalties, andwe shall take steps to rectify that as soon as opportunity occurs. We couldprepare a short Bill confined to increasing the penalties, and decide in the light of circumstances whether to introduce it ourselves or to offer it to a Private Membersuccessful in the Ballot. These tactics would probably help us in persuadingGovernment supporters such as Mr. Iremonger to stay their hand and not givesupport to any Bill brought in by an Opposition Private Member (as is almost certain to happen) to strengthen section 5 on the lines described in paragraph above.H.
