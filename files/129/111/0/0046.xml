Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1962C. (62) 196 Copy No.   g \4th December, 1962CABINETEGYPTIAN COMPENSATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs since the conclusion of the Anglo-United Arab Republic Financial Agreementof 1959 there has been increasing agitation, both in Parliament and outside it, fora supplementary grant from public funds to satisfy those people whose needs wereincompletely met, or not met at all, by the Agreement, as supplemented by theExchanges of Notes of 7th August, 1962. In both Houses the pressure comesprimarily from our own benches. The principal demands or criticisms are these:(a) A grant to increase the Egyptian Compensation Fund, which; will fulfil the Prime Minister^ statement on 16th March, 1959, when he said&quot;The Government . . . will play their part in reaching a settlement which will be reasonable and fair, and we do not exclude a further contribution from public funds&quot;. (Hansard, Col. 150.) The total ofthe amounts claimed (including those assessed by the foreign compensation Commission where assessment has been made) was 67-18 million at 31st October, 1962. The Fund was originally  27-5 million: out of this a large number of claims have already been paid.The amount of interest accruing to the Fund is: likely to bring it upto a total figure of  29-75 million after deduction of income tax.The Fund is at present being distributed by the foreign compensation Commission on a sliding scale under the foreign compensation (Egypt) (Interim Distribution) (Amendment) Order of27th November, 1961 (S.I. 1961/2276) which produces the following effect :On the first  5,000 of each claim    ...   90   per   cent,   of   theamount assessed.On the next  45,000 .........   60 per cent.On the next  450,000 .........   35 per centOn   any   additional    amount    over 500,000     ............   20 per cent.So far as can be estimated at present the payment on this scale of all claims that have been or are likely to be presented to the commission will absorb the whole of the notional  29 - 75 million. (This assumes that payments of the amounts calculated on this scale are made infull. In fact, some of the claimants receive less than the full amount as a sum is withheld in full or partial liquidation of their ex-gratialoans. These sums will be paid to the Exchequer; but this does not affect any of the calculations in this paper.) I consider a further sumis now necessary by way of topping up.(b) The levying of United Kingdom tax on the Fund&apos;s investments, has arousedstrong protests in Parliament (Lords, 29th November, 1961 and24th January, 1962). The amount involved is expected ultimately to total about  1-3 million.   This money cannot legally be waived,
remitted or refunded; but if a further sum is provided by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment for the Fund the Treasury have agreed to an announcement that the &quot; Exchequer contribution is made with this factor in mind&quot;.(c) Compensation for cases not now covered. Article 8 of the foreign compensation (Egypt) (Determination and Registration of Claims)Order, 1962, provides for &quot; registration &quot; of claims which fail in certain respects to qualify for compensation under the provisions of the Order.Most of these claims are for sales of effects under duress. I considerthat this provision for their registration implied that they should bemade eligible for compensation when money became available.(d) Additional compensation to the British Officials dismissed by the egyptian government in 1951 (C.C. (62) 35th Conclusions, Minute 4). the officials&apos; Association are claiming  660,000. They have also maintained that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should, in addition, not ask for therefund of the legal expenses (amounting to  8,904) incurred by theAssociation (and paid by Her Majesty&apos;s Government) in presentingtheir claim to the Egyptian Government; and should also make furthergrants to cover depreciation in the value of the sum claimed since 1951and loss of interest on it (see House of Common Notices of Motions,27th November, 1962, No. 15). While we can reasonably say that a claim of  660,000 is inflated, I do not consider that the  200,000 alreadyadvanced, and partly liquidated by the  165,094 paid to Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment by the United Arab Republic, is an adequate final settlement.(e) Assistance with Agents&apos; Fees. Almost all British owners of property inEgypt have had to employ agents to arrange the return of their property and the transfer of their assets. Messrs. Toplis and Harding (middle east) Limited, who act as agents for about half the property owners,estimate their fees and expenses to average just under  250 a head,of which about  83 represents expenses in the United Kingdom. Upto now so many owners have been unable to meet these fees that Toplisand Harding have had to be kept in business by means of advancesfrom the Exchequer amounting to  100,000. I &quot;feel we must help theproperty owners to pay these fees.(/) Assistance to those who have property in Egypt worth over  E.5,000, whichis released from sequestration, but which they cannot enjoy or maintain.I am submitting a separate paper (C. (62) 197) on this aspect ofthe problem.2. In order to meet the above claims and criticisms I propose by way of afinal settlement:(a) &quot; Topping-up &quot; of the Compensation Fund. That an Order in Councilbe made directing the Foreign Compensation Commission to makefinal payments on the following scale on amounts assessed (this would of course replace, and not supplement, the scale at present in force):(Present Scale)On the first  10,000     ...     100 per cent.      (90 per cent, on first 5,000)On the next  40,000    ...      75 per cent.      (60 per cent, on next 45,000)On the next  450,000  ...      50 percent.      (35 per cent.)On the next  500,000  ...      30 per cent. ^On the next  1,000,000 ...     25 per cent. I   (20 per cent.)On the part of any claim \exceeding  2,000,000 ...      20 per cent. JThe total cost, at these rates, is estimated at  35-27 million or about 5-5 million of new money. It would give a 100 per cent, paymentof the assessed amount of their losses to over 90 per cent, of the
claimants, and substantial percentage increases.to all other categoriesup to  2 million. Claims assessed at more than  2 million will ofcourse also benefit by the higher scales up to that sum.&apos;(b) That in the eventual announcement, this extra  5-5 million should be expressed in two parts :(i) a payment into the Fund of approximately  1-3 million, to take into account the United Kingdom tax payable on the income of the Egyptian Compensation Fund investments: but notconstituting a refund of that tax; and(ii) a supplementary grant of approximately  4-2 million: these twogrants together enabling the Foreign Compensation Commissionto pay compensation on the revised scale proposed above.(c) &quot; Registered&quot; Claims. That the Foreign Compensation commission should be directed by Order in Council to pay on the same scaleother claims arising out of Suez but not specifically covered by theFinancial Agreement-i.e., the claims registered under Article 8 ofPart TV of the Foreign Compensation (Egypt) (Determination andRegistration of Claims) Order 1962 (see paragraph 1 (c) above). Thiswould require about another  1 million.(d) &quot; 1951 Officials &quot;-That  200,000 be granted to the Association of british officials dismissed by the Egyptian Government in 1951 in full and final settlement of their claim for compensation. This would bringthe total compensation paid to the Association to  400,000. I have reason to believe that they would accept this, and I consider it areasonable sum.(e) Agents&apos; Fees. That grants to individuals (not to companies) not exceeding 100 a head for assistance with agents&apos; fees and expenses be made through the Foreign Office. This would probably materially assistMessrs. Toplis and Harding to discharge their debt to Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment. This provision is expected to require not more than 500,000.3. To summarise. I ask my colleagues to agree to the provision of amaximum sum of  7-5 million for the above purposes. I appreciate that this figure is slightly above the total of the various grants I have asked for above. But,since the figures on which our calculations are based are inevitably at this stageapproximate, I think it is essential that we should have a certain margin. Inmaking this request for  7 - 5 million, I have not overlooked the fact, to which theTreasury have drawn attention, that Her Majesty&apos;s Government have already given financial assistance, mainly by loans in 1957 and 1958, to British subjects from Egypt and that, although well over  1 million of the loans then made hasalready been repaid and repayments are still being made, it is unlikely that thefull amount will ever be recovered. However, my object is to close the wholequestion of the obligations of Her Majesty&apos;s Government arising out of the Suezincident and I therefore ask my colleagues to agree to the submission of any necessary Order in Council directing the Foreign Compensation Commission tomake payments on the new scales proposed above, and to a statement being madein both Houses of Parliament at the earliest possible moment embodying theseproposals. If the proposal which is developed in C. (62) 197 is accepted, the totalmaximum of the grants I am asking for will be  10 million.H.Foreign Office, S.W.1,3rd December, 1962.
