9th November, 1962CABINETIRON AND STEEL HOLDING AND REALISATION AGENCYSALE OF FIVE SMALL COMPANIESMemorandum by the Chief Secretary to the treasury and Paymaster-GeneralThe Iron and Steel Holding and Realisation Agency have put tome a proposal to sell their holding in the five small companies remaining in their ownership.    The companies concerned are:-Bairds and Scottish Steel, Ltd.Barrow Ironworks, Ltd,Gjers, Mills and Company, Ltd.John Baker and Bessemer, Ltd.Skinningrove Iron Company, Ltd.Details of the companies are at Annex &apos;A&apos; .2.        An offer for the companies has been made by a consortium often of the major steel companies organised by the British Iron andSteel Federation.     The price which the group are offering is  7, 150, 000, but, allowing for  1. 25 million of funds deposited by thecompanies with the Agency which would be repaid, the net payment tothe Agency would be  5. 9 million.     This is well below the value of thecompanies in the Agency&apos;s books which is  11 million, and still furtherbelow the  18. 6 million which is the figure for their net assets.    Thecompanies&apos; prospects are poor and they cannot be regarded as saleablein the ordinary sense.    The present offer has been made on the basisof their break-up value.3.        The effect of the acceptance of the offer would be to completede-nationalisation of the steel industry with the substantial exceptionof Richard Thomas and Baldwins and one or two loans which matureanyhow in 1964.4.        The initiative by the Federation has been made at least inpart with the intention of helping the Government to hasten the final stages of de-nationalisation, and has been made with official, encourage -ment.     The Treasury and Ministry of Power have long had in mind the possibility that the Federation might organise the purchase of the outstanding group of Agency subsidiaries, when this had shrunk to a sufficiently small size.    For his part Sir Julian Pode, the Chairmanof the Federation, has told me that the group organised by theFederation have been actuated by a feeling that the Federation were-1-cJMLm1. 2 5(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO. jj J-
under an obligation to help to complete the process of de-nationalisation.(They recognise that Richard Thomas and Baldwins presents a separateproblem. )    They also consider that there would be advantage to theindustry, in the event of the threat of further nationalisation, inremoving as many firms as possible from public ownership.5.        Sir Julian Pode has told us that the group would think itnecessary to close one of the two hematite producing firms (Barrowand Gjers) straight away.     They do not themselves mind which isclosed.    Thereafter they would need about a year to size up thesituation but are prepared to agree to a statement about the future ofthe other four companies as set out in the last paragraph of the draft statement at Annex &apos;B&apos; to this paper.6.        The Agency recommend acceptance of the offer.     They thinkit extremely unlikely that they would ever be able to sell any of thefive companies to private investors.    If they retain them they wouldbe bound to close one and possibly both of the hematite firms.    a third company, Baker and Bessemer, are largely dependent uponorders from British Railways and ought, for economic production, tobe merged with one of the other suppliers of railway equipment.     Theother two companies - Skinningrove and Bairds and Scottish - could have a longer life, and substantial sums have been invested by them inrecent years mainly out of their retained profits.     Neither can,however, be regarded as a viable unit in the long run and, if their order books were to fall further, as is all too likely, continued owner-ship of these companies could be a real embarrassment to the Govern-ment.     The price has been increased as a result of negotiations, but is still on the low side.     The Agency have consulted Cooper Brothers,whose advice was that  8 million would be a favourable price, and  l\ million a reasonable one.    Sir Julian Fode has, however, made it clear that the price as proposed in paragraph 2 is the maximumto which the group could agree.    Allowance must be made for thefact that some of the companies may eventually be closed andredundancy payments made to the employees.7.        Sir Julian Pode has asked that, as part of the transaction,the Government should provide three assurances on the followingline s: -(i)   The Government would wind up the Iron and SteelHolding and Realisation Agency and transfer the shares in Richard Thomas and Baldwins to theTreasury.(ii) The Government would make it known that theposition of the five companies was not strong and that they could not be expected to continue in operation indefinitely.(iii) The Government would not encourage or financeany further schemes for the expansion of the steel industry.-2-
8.        The third of Sir Julian Fode&apos;s conditions does not present any-serious problem.    Sir Julian understands that Richard Thomas and baldwins will need in due course to expand capacity at the new strip-mill to enable it to operate at its most economical level of output,and that the Government have a commitment in this direction.Whether that expansion will involve Exchequer finance when it takes place will of course depend on whether Richard Thomas and Baldwinshave by then been de-nationalised.    But I believe that Sir Julian Podewould be content with a public announcement to the effect that nofurther major investment on Government account in the steel indusrty was at present contemplated, and probably the best method of handling this would be to arrange a Question in the House of Commonsfor the purpose of making such an announcement.9.        From the Governments point of view the most difficult ofSir Julian Pode&apos;s conditions is the second.    To make a public state-ment linking the de-nationalisation of the companies with theirpotential closure would be very difficult.    On the other hand theprice of the sale is going to attract criticism, and the Governmentwill be bound, in their own defence, to go some way towards making clear the companies&apos; poor earning prospects.    I have consideredwith the Agency how far the Government might reasonably go towardsgiving the assurance which he seeks and, as indicated above, I attachas Annex &apos;B&apos; to this paper the draft of a possible statement by the agency.     The draft is acceptable to Sir Julian Pode.     The Agencyrecognise that the management and unions at Gjers Mills and company, Ltd. will have to be informed in advance of the announce-ment of the substance of paragraph 4 of the draft.10.       The Federation no longer appear to attach much importanceto the first of Sir Julian Pode&apos;s conditions.    I do not, moreover,think it necessary to agree to it.    In the first place there is room for doubt whether it would be legally within the Governments powers under the Iron and Steel Act, 1953, to wind up the Agency as longas they own Richard Thomas and Baldwins with net assets of theorder of  250 million.    Secondly, and more important, I believethat the importance which the Federation attach to the Agency&apos;scontinued existence is out of proportion to its real significance.I would propose to explain this point of view to Sir Julian Pode.At the same time I would add that the Government would naturally be considering carefully what is the right future for the Agencyafter they have disposed of all their holdings apart fromRichard Thomas and Baldwins.    I would make it clear to him that i could give no assurance as to what that future might be.11.       These proposals raise very difficult and in my view fairlyevenly balanced political issues*    On the one hand, the sale to a consortium of &quot;steel barons&quot; of five small companies, one of whichwill be closed down and none of which are promised a long life,would evoke strong criticism from our opponents.    It would certainly not fit altogether into the picture of de-nationalisation as we have presented it.    Nor are Sir Julian Pode&apos;s conditions particularly-3-CO N FI DE NTS AL
sensible - though I do not think this aspect of the matter is decisive.More serious criticism would be directed at an apparently low pricerelative to book values.decision.    If it went through, steel de-nationalisation could be shown to be completed with the substantial exception of Richard Thomas and baldwins and the unimportant exception of one or two prior charges which mature in 1964.    More important is the fact that if we rebuffthe representatives of the industry and reject the advice of the agency it is unlikely that we shall ever get rid of these companies.We shall certainly have to close one of them shortly and face similardecisions in respect of others before very long.    Our own supporters in Parliament will of course learn of this matter from the industryand be very critical of Ministers&apos; apparent lack of determination topress on with de-nationalisation.     The argument that refusal was based on the price being too low is not really sustainable in view ofthe nature of these companies and the results of expert valuation bothindependently and by the Agency.13.       I have discussed the proposed sale with the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster who has certain reservations about it.14,       My own view is that on the merits of the matter we ought toproceed with the sale.     The decision however must take account of otheconsiderations on which I would be grateful for the guidance of theCabinet.    If the decision is to go ahead there would arise questionsof the timing of the announcement of the sale and of the closing ofGjers works.    But I need not trouble my colleagues on those questions at this stage.    A decision to reject the offer would also require very careful handling.12.But on the other hand to turn this down would be a seriousJ o A. B. - C.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1,9th November, 1962.-4-

Loans of  1, 250, 000 and  1, 800, 000 areowed respectively by Barrow Ironworks Limited and SkinningroveIron Company Limited to the Agency.     The right to repayment ofthese loans passes to the purchasers as a result of the sale.2.     Of the purchase price of  7,150, 000, the sum of  715, 000 hasbeen paid to the Agency;  the purchasers have undertaken to paythe balance of  6,435, 000 with interest not later than 1963.3.     As a result of this sale, and following the sale of theSecond Debenture Stock of the Steel Company of Wales, the processof de-nationalisation of the steel industry has, with the majorexception of Richard Thomas and Baldwins Limited (which, for thepresent remains in public hands) been virtually completed.     Theonly holdings remaining to the Agency are certain prior charges and a loan to the Steel Company of Wales, all of which are repayablein 1964.4.      Two of the companies included in the transaction (BarrowIronworks and Gjers Mills) are producers mainly of hematite pigiron.    During recent years the consumption and uses of this producthave been declining and it has become apparent that capacity notonly considerably exceeds current demand but also exceedsforeseeable demand in the future.    Despite the fact that productionof the two companies during recent months has been running farbelow capacity, stocks of hematite pig iron have continued to accumulate and are now excessively high.    The situation has beena source of increasing anxiety to the Agency.     They consider that-7-
the situation can best be met by the early closure, as a measure of rationalisation, of Gjers Mills.     The purchasers have indicated thatthey also expect to find themselves obliged to take this step.     Theyhave undertaken to give as much notice as possible when.a decision as to the date of closure is taken and have stated their intention ofmaking reasonable redundancy payments to those employees affected.5.      In addition to the two companies mentioned above the other three also have - like many other steel producers - been operatingfor some time at very much less than capacity.    All five are, in whole or in part, specialist producers, the demand for whose productshas declined.     The future prospects of these companies must depend both on the state of demand in the iron and steel industry generally and of demand for their special products.    But thepurchasers have indicated that they have no present intention of taking any steps that would result in an early closure of any ofthose companies.Iron and Steel Holding and Realisation Agency,1, Chester Street,LONDON, S.
