Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1962C. (62) 175 Copy No.    5113th November, 1962CABINETBUSHY PARKMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and minister for Welsh AffairsThe United States Air Force camps in Bushy Park have been vacated recently,and I have suggested to the Home Affairs Committee that the brick buildings onthe main site should not be demolished but instead be used temporarily for the accommodation of homeless families. At the meeting of the Home AffairsCommittee I was asked to submit to the Cabinet, in consultation with the first secretary of State, a statement of the case for using these buildings in this way.2. Homelessness in London has become increasingly serious since the LondonCounty Council (L.C.C.) first raised the problem with my predecessor 12 months ago. During the year the number of homeless families in the care of the L.C.C.has gone up relentlessly week by week, and has now just about reached the 1,000mark, involving some 4,670 persons. This represents an increase of more than50 per cent, on the figures a year ago 650 families, and some 3,100 persons. Therehas also been an upward trend in homelessness in Middlesex.3. The primary responsibility for looking after these unfortunate families lies with the local authorities, but we have promised to give all the help we can. TheL.C.C. have considerably increased their provision for homeless families, by meansof more short-stay accommodation, by buying up empty houses, and by puttingtemporary mobile homes (with the help of Exchequer subsidy) on vacant sites; butthey are still losing ground.4. The danger for us is that the situation may get out of hand. There hasalready been criticism that the Government have not been doing enough to help;and we may be exposed to further attack if suitable buildings at Bushy Park aresimply demolished without any attempt to put them to use to relieve the sorryplight of London&apos;s homeless.5. The buildings on the main site are sound and in good condition, wellappointed, with adequate heating and with many of the rooms of convenient sizefor family accommodation. All the buildings are connected with good concreteroads and paths. The buildings could be readily adapted to serve as a receptioncentre, i.e., to provide shelter for families who would move on after two to threemonths to permanent accommodation. It is estimated that the cost might beroughly  40,000, or   165 per family.6. The big problem is practicability. To begin with, it is impossible without legislation for the L.C.C. (or any other local authority) to take over the camp for housing purposes: they are expressly debarred by statute from managing anyenterprise in a Royal Park. In the light of the Attorney-General&apos;s advice on thelegal aspect it would appear that the only way under existing law of getting the camp used for housing would be for the Minister of Public Building and Works toappoint some body (other than a local authority) to act as his agent to manage the camp.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
7. It might therefore be possible to bring in a voluntary body-for example,one of the large housing societies, such as the Peabody or Guinness Trust-to run the camp for homeless families, working in collaboration with the L.C.C. andpossibly the Middlesex County Council.8. But much as I would like to see the camp used for homeless families I donot believe.that an arrangement of this kind would be workable. The financialand administrative difficulties would be too great. The L.C.C. would have to putipithe money for adaptation and maintenance but they would have no real control.The housing society would be in a very awkward position: they would be responsible to the Minister of Public Building and Works, but all the time would have to satisfy the L.C.C. In any case it is very unlikely that the L.C.C. would be interested in suchan arrangement. From informal consultations with the GounciFs officers it is clearthat they have no liking for working through an intermediary and can be expected toadvise the Council against any such arrangement.9. A further difficulty is that the Council&apos;s officers do not think that the campis really suitable for use as a reception centre. It is too distant and off centre to be convenient for this purpose. They think the better use would be for the campto be adapted to provide separate family accommodation for families staying for as long as 18 months or 2 years before being permanently rehoused. To do thiswould however greatly increase the cost of adaptation for example, each familywould have to be equipped with its own cooking facilities. This is likely to run intoseveral hundred pounds per family and would not be worth doing unless the campcould be retained for at least 7 years. To alienate the site for such a long period as this would be bound to arouse protests from the open spaces and other amenityinterests. There would almost certainly be opposition too from the local authoritiesin this part of Middlesex. Some of them are known to favour the retention for public enjoyment of the community buildings and recreation facilities of the campsite (hall, cinema and play spaces); but none of them suggested use for housing and they are bound to object to the bringing in of families from the County ofLondon over a period of years.10. The alternative would be to legislate to enable the L.C.C. themselves tobe brought in either as agents or to take over the camp on lease or licence. I donot, however, think this can be contemplated. Though the legislation would besimple it would be extremely awkward to handle. It would open the way to lengthyand embarrassing Parliamentary debate on homelessness, there would be an openrow with the amenity interests and the likelihood of strong opposition from the localauthorities and local inhabitants.11. Accordingly, though very reluctantly, I have come to the conclusion thatthe expedient course is to abandon any idea of using the camp in Bushy Park forhomeless families.12. If we do this, we must be ready to face criticism. But I think our positionis defensible. We could say that the.possibility had been thoroughly explored butthat in view of the statutory embargo on the L.C.C. or any other local authority,there was no effective means of enabling the camp to be used for housing purposes.If my colleagues agree with my conclusion, I think it would be prudent for astatement to this effect to be made before the work of demolition is started.K. J.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.W. 1,12th November, 1962.
