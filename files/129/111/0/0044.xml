C.(62) 1944th December, 1962UNIVERSITY TEACHERS&apos; salaries memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer this memorandum reports the views of the Wages Committee,of which I am Chairman, upon a proposal that we should announce a10 per cent increase in university teachers&apos; salaries as from 1st April, 1963, and also refer their pay to the National IncomesCommission for review.The background.     We had good reasons for our actions, but our treatment of university teachers&apos; pay has turned out harshly:(i)     The last university increase took effect from 1st January, I960.It was less than the University Grants Committee (U. G. C. )had recommended.    Within a few weeks the increases wereoutstripped by relatively larger increases with longerretrospection for the Civil Service, and Civil Service pay is taken by the universities as a main comparison for university pay.(ii)     The U. G. C. would accordingly have sponsored an additionalclaim for university teachers, but we restrained them in orderthat such a claim could be synchronised with the approachingBurnham settlement for the rest of the teaching profession.The Burnham Committee eventually reached a provisional agreement in June, 1961, on an increase equivalent to16^ per cent on average.    We wrote this down to14 j per cent on average (which still entailed as muchas 17 per cent for many teachers at colleges of advanced technology) and accepted it, so amended, on 25th July,in the context of the pay pause;  on the same day we received the expected proposals from the U, G. C. for a17 per cent increase in university salaries.(iii)     We undertook to work out what the universities shouldhave, for implementation at the end of the pause.But, while we were considering a Treasury proposalfor an 8 fcp 9 per cent increase, the time came to announce the interim phase of the incomes policy andthe Cabinet decided that the university teachers couldonly have, an average of 3 per cent taking effect from 1st April, 1962, and subject to review at the end of thatyear.-1-COPY NO.51CABINET
(iv)    Many people in other services, who were aggrieved bythe application of the pay pause and the interim phase,have since had their claims settled by arbitration, acourse not open to university teachers.    Burnhamnegotiations for a further increase for teachers have started, and the Wages Committee have agreed to theemployers&apos; side seeking to settle on the basis of afurther 3^ per cent on top of the 14f per cent theseteachers have already received.3.      There is a feeling of bitterness in the universities against theGovernment, and the Ui G. C. are under strong pressure.    The U;G. C.themselves resent our rejection of their advice in I960 and subsequently.4.     Meantime we have announced our objective of increasinguniversity student numbers by 35 per cent by 1966-67, and are provid-ing funds to keep the present ratio of staff to students.     If universitiescontinue to take for staff the same proportion as in recent times of the output of graduates, and wastage does not worsen, their staff numbers will increase by 25 per cent in this period.    But the other10 per cent means an increase in their share of new graduates.    to affect recruitment for the next academic year, we need an announce-ment on salai*ies by early January.    That ia why a decision isnecessary now.5.      The Chairman of the National Incomes Commission has been consulted to see whether he would be willing to accept a referencewith a view to an award to university teachers to match this timetable.He has indicated that he is anxious to avoid a position in which on oneof their first major tasks the Commission would have insufficient timeto do a thorough job which will necessarily take a lengthy period, buthe will accept a reference for a full review of university teachers&apos; payin the Commission^ own time and would not regard it as inconsistent with this if we ourselves made some increase in the meantime.The U. G. C. have also been sounded informally and, although theyadhere to their view that a much larger increase than 10 per cent has for some time been justified, they would be prepared to acquiesce in and advise on the distribution of an increase of this size.The views of the Wages committee.     There have been two groups of view on wages Committee.   the minority view has been that to be consistent with our incomes policy the Government should not grant increases in university pay exceedingwhat can be justified by the rate of growth of the national product,except for a revaluation by the National Incomes Commission; andthat if there is to be a reference to the Commission the Governmentshould give no more meantime than would generally be accepted as an interim increase.    The supporting arguments have been as follows:-(2)
(i)     Any increase necessary now is to help recruitment.    Itshould not take effect therefore until August, 1963, thebeginning of the next financial academic year.    TheCommission are to carry out a full review, any increasenow must clearly be only an interim increase, and an effective date of August, 1963 could justify at most anincrease of 3j-5 per cent as relating to the period sinceApril, 1962.(ii)    A greater increase is not justified by the recruitmentproblem.    Teaching posts in universities are not unfilled.Industry finds it difficult to attract scientists away fromuniversities.(iii) It does not matter if we decline to follow the advice of theU.G, C. The advice on university pay should now comefrom the Commission.(iv)     The only alternative is to give an increase in the region of10 per cent and to specify that this must stand for a fixed period ahead.    There would then not be a reference to theCommission.7.     The majority view was in favour of granting a 10 per cent increase in university teachers&apos; pay with effect from 1st April, 1963and referring the matter to the National Incomes Commission for afull revaluation.    Their views were as follows:-(i)    An increase of less than 10 per cent might imperil theuniversity expansion programme.(ii)    On recruitment we must take the advice of the U,G. C. .which is understood to coincide with the views of theCommittee on Higher Education under the chairmanship of Lord Robbins, that the situation is serious.    We must take account of future competition for graduates from industry and especially of the position in science wherelarger expansion is planned, competition from abroad iskeenest, and where the ratio of staff to students alreadyshows a deterioration.(iii)      It would have an adverse affect on outside opinion if wekeep down university pay when we are already grantingthe universities less than they want in other respects,(iv)     A revaluation of university pay will be necessary in thelight of the report of the Robbins Committee on higher education, which is expected in the summer.    a reference to the National Incomes Commission is there-fore necessary.    It is bound to mean an increase of atleast 10 per cent having regard to the present situationand given that -(a) the University Grants Committee thought17 per cent was justified in July of lastyearj-3-
(b) other teachers in higher education have already had on average 14\ per cent,while unversity teachers have had an average of 3 per cent.(v) Universities would be a good case to demonstrate that thethe Commission has a revaluation, as well as a criticalrole to play.conclusion.      The Cabinet are invited to decide whether an interim increaseof 10 per cent from 1st April, 1963 should be granted to unversity teachers with a reference of their pay to the National IncomesCommission for revaluation, as the majority of Wages committee held to be necessary.r. m.Treasury Chambers, S.
