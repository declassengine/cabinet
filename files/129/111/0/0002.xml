copy no.513rd october-t- 1962CABINETRAILv7AYMEN&apos;S WAGJMemorandum by the Minister of TransportIntroductionI have dealt in a separate paper with the important issues ofpolicy, as I see them, on which we should concentrate.     I wish hereto discuss the possible methods of imposing a particular solution, if that should prove necessary, on the British Transport Commission.Formal direction2.       I have powers under the Transport Act, 1947 (which will becontinued in similar terms under the Transport Act, 1962) to give ageneral direction to the British Transport Commission in relation to matters affecting the national interest.     The JLaw Officers of theCrown have in the past considered the way in which this power mightbe used in relation to wages.     They concluded that the chief difficultyarose from the need to ensure that directions were in fact general.Even though a direction might appear general in form, it could be opento challenge if it appeared to be designed to meet the situation presented by an actual wage claim.    I think it is inevitable that any direction given during the next few weeks would be open to this objection, and I accord-ingly recommend that we should not consider further the possibility ofa formal general direction in relation to the current wage claim.Other means of intervention3.       The second possibility is a communication of a formal character,intended to be published, which would nevertheless not have actualstatutory backing.    Such a document might state, for instance, that no more than a certain annual sum could be regarded as available from theExchequer to finance a wage increasej   alternatively it might proposesome other course such as reference to arbitration.    On 27th January,1962  the Government sent the Commission and the Unions a letter ofthis kind;  this referred to the financial state of the railways and theGovernment&apos;s wages policy, and in effect asked that the claim should bereferred to arbitration in the context of these considerations.     TheCommission agreed to this course, but the Unions rejected it (with thesupport of the Opposition in Parliament) as an interference with the established negotiating procedure, and the proposal was not proceeded with.Sis document is the property of her britannic i^ajesty^ government)
Ministry of Transport, S.E. 1.2nd October, 1962(a)(b)(c)Quite apart from this incident, it can be argued that -such an intervention undermines the statutory-responsibilities of the management.    Further,it provides them with grounds for inability tocarry out the obligations set out in the white paper on the Financial and EconomicObligations of the Nationalised Industries(Cmnd. 1337);the employees (and indeed the public) may wellregard intervention as a usurpation by the,  Government, with consequent damage to future relations between employers and employed;after Government intervention the Unions may take the line that they must negotiate direct with the Government.    If, under threat of astrike, a concession is then made, theGovernment&apos;s reputation may suffer.Further, such a conflict with the Unions would be particularly unfortunate at a time when their collaboration in the field ofeconomic policy, and more particularly in the field of incomes policy, is of special importance.E.M.
