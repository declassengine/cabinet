C. (62) 208 Copy No. 5118th December, 1962. CABINETFEDERATION OF RHODESIA AND NYASALANDNote by the First Secretary of StateMy colleagues may wish to see the attached record of a discussion whichI had yesterday evening with the High Commissioner for the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland.R. A. B.Office of the First Secretary of State, S.W. 1,18th December, 1962.RECORD OF discussion the High Commissioner for the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasalandcalled on the First Secretary of State this evening and handed him a telegramcontaining a message from the Federal Prime Minister, Sir Roy Welensky, whichwas in reply to the personal message which the First Secretary of State sent byMr. Caldicott, the Federal Minister for the Public Service. Sir Roy Welensky&apos;message contained no personal note of warmth but merely recorded that, in thelight of the Southern Rhodesian election results, Sir Roy Welensky felt it necessaryto justify his stewardship and therefore proposed to publish a White Paper which^vould, to use his terms, give an account of his betrayal over the years by theBritish Government and their weakness in face of the forces of Pan-Africanism.A copy of this White Paper would be in the hands of the First Secretary of state by lunch-time on Wednesday, 19th December.2. The High Commissioner went on to say that the reason why FederalMinisters were so concerned about Nyasaland was simply that they felt that theposition of Northern Rhodesia was entirely analogous. Their real fear was,therefore, that in six months&apos; time a similar statement about Northern rhodesia would be being made. The First Secretary of State replied that it was with thiskind of uncertainty in mind that he had felt unable to give the assurances forwhich Federal Ministers had asked last week about the continuing politicalassociation between the two Rhodesias.3. The High Commissioner ended the interview with an impassioned pleato the First Secretary of State to defer the statement on Nyasaland proposed tobe made on Wednesday, 19th December, and instead to advance to the 7th january the date of his proposed visit to Central Africa. The High Commissioner saidthat it would be more convenient for the new Governments in the two Rhodesiasif the visit were to take place rather earlier when consideration could be given to possible alternative methods of approach. The First Secretary of State said thathe, on the other hand, felt that they would need time before his visit to consider their position. While he would certainly give careful thought to what the HighCommissioner had said, he felt that there would be no point in the proposed change of plan, for his position and that of the Federal Ministers in relation tothe central problem of the situation between the two Rhodesias would be precisely the same in early January as it had been during the discussions last week. Thediscussions which had just taken place would, therefore, have to be repeated allover again and this would be a rather sterile and unrewarding exercise.17th December, 1962.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.
