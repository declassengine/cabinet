Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1962 &quot;C. (62) 199 Copy No.    513rd December, 1962CABINETIRON AND STEEL HOLDING AND&quot; REALISATION AGENCY-SALEOF FIVE SMALL COMPANIESMemorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and paymaster GeneralWhen the Cabinet recently considered my memorandum (C. (62) 178) on theproposed sale by the Iron and Steel Holding and Realisation Agency of theirholding in the five small companies remaining in their ownership to a consortiumof major steel companies organised by the British Iron and Steel Federation, some doubt was expressed about certain aspects of the proposal and I was asked toconsider the matter further in consultation with the Home Secretary and theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (C.C. (62) 68th Conclusions, Minute 4).2. Although my colleagues recognised the disposal would mean that, apartfrom Richard Thomas and Baldwins (and two loans maturing in 1964 andunimportant in this context), the Government had completed denationalisationof the steel industry, it was thought by some of my colleagues that since none ofthe companies concerned was in a strong position and early closure of at anyrate one of them was inevitable, it would be undesirable on presentational grounds to appear to be selling off all these companies to the &quot; steel barons &quot;.3. I have discussed the matter further with the Home Secretary and theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. As a result of our discussions (and offurther consultation which I have had with the Agency) I recommend the following alternative proposal for the approval of the Cabinet.4. This alternative is, in brief, that the sale should be split. The BarrowIronworks Ltd. and Gjers, Mills and Company Ltd. (both haematite companies)should be sold to the Millom Haematite Ore and Iron Company, Ltd., who had previously made an offer for these two companies, and the remaining three (Bairdsand Scottish Steel Ltd., John Baker and Bessemer, Ltd., and Skinningrove IronCompany, Ltd.) to the Federation consortium.5. The Chairman of the Agency has had exploratory discussions with theMillom Company and with Sir Julian Pode, who is acting on behalf of the consortium, and as a result it seems a reasonable probability that the disposalcan be carried out in this way.6. It also seems probable that the two transactions would together yield thesame price ( 7-15 million) as was offered by the consortium for the five companies.Allowing for funds deposited by the companies with the Agency, which would be repaid, this would represent a net payment to the Agency of  5-9 million. AsI explained earlier, although this is well below the book value of the companies in the Agency&apos;s books ( 11 million) or the figure for their net assets ( 18-6 million)the circumstances of the companies make any such comparison quite unrealistic,and it is quite clear to me that we shall not get a better price, as is confirmed bythe probability that the proceeds of a split sale are likely to be about the same asthe consortium^ package offer.
7.   The advantages of proceeding in the way proposed are:(i) We shall have made further substantial progress in implementing ourdeclared policy of denationalising the steel industry.(ii) By disposing of all five companies, we shall avoid having to close anywhile they remain in Government hands. One early closure is unavoidable and others may have to follow later: if we retained thecompanies we might thus have to face serious and protractedembarrassment.(iii) Although early closure of one of the firms is unavoidable, the MillomCompany (to whom it is proposed to sell Barrow Ironworks and Gjers,Mills) would after acquisition close Barrow which is in the same area&apos;only some 20 miles away, whereas the consortium would, of the two,have probably preferred to close Gjers, Mills. Although there may belittle to choose between the two closures from the local employmentpoint of view, the closure of Barrow would at least have the advantage that it could properly be represented as a sensible measure of rationalisation by the nearby acquiring firm. It might also provide a somewhat better prospect of alternative work for those affected.8. It is not certain whether, if the disposal took place in the different mannernow proposed, we should still be pressed to include in the Agency&apos;s public announcement a statement foreshadowing the early closure of one of thecompanies, on the lines of paragraph 4 of Annex B of C. (62) 178. But I shouldbe prepared to arrange for an appropriate statement to be included, if necessary.In this case it would also clearly be necessary for the trade union(s) concerned tobe informed in advance.9. I hope that my colleagues may feel disposed to agree with these proposals,and if they do so I will ask the Agency to attempt to dispose of the companies inthis way.J. A.
