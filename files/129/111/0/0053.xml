-    IllC. (62) 2034th December, 1962COPY NO.51CABINETFLUORIDATION OF WATERMemorandum by the&apos; Chancellor of the duchy of lancaster the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Healthhave circulated a memorandum (C.(62) 198) which recommends thatapproval should be given to local health authorities for arrangements which would secure the addition of fluoride up to one part per million to the water supplied to their areas.2.        .&apos; The evidence of the tests over a period of five years is, inmy view, clear.     I think it is important, however, that the cabinet should realise the objections, however ill-informed they may be, whichaction along the lines suggested will bring.     I think I am right in sayingthat in one area (Andover) the scheme was not proceeded with becauseof the possibility of a case being brought.     In one of the three studyareas (Kilmarnock) the scheme is not being pursued now that the testperiod has come to an end.     In many areas there will be objections andit seems to me quite certain that when we widen the field to all localauthorities a test case will be brought.     In this event, we have no more than an even money chance of success, and in the event of failure would be forced to legislate.3. The objections would come in part from those who detestthis sort of Government action (on the lines of the &quot;Gentleman in whitehall knows best&quot;) and in part from those who would spread themost absurd lies about the result of such action.     Its opponents are &apos;saying and will continue to say that every sort of disease, includingcancer, will be caused.     I know this is nonsense, but this does notalter the fact that such accusations are certain to come.4. It may well be right in spite of this to proceed with theaction that the Health Ministers recommend, and on health groundsI could not possibly oppose it.     Nevertheless it is important that weshould realise how much opposition even this apparently simple movewill attract.I. M.Office of the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, S. W. 1.4th December, 1962.
