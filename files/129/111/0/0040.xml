CABINETPOST OFFICE FINANCE AND prices memorandum by the Postmaster-general at Cabinet on the 27th November I was invited to set out how the capital of the Post Office had been assessed for the purpose of calculating its financialreturn (C.C. (62) 71st Conclusions, Minute 2).2. I now circulate statements at Annex A giving the composition of PostOffice capital and other aspects of Post Office finances.  They are:(a) Capital Account(i) Fixed assets(ii) Financing of capital(b) Current Account(i) How return on net assets is calculated(ii) Growth of income3. I have considered amendments to the tariff changes I proposed inC. (62) 187 in the light of the last Cabinet discussion. I attach at Annex B a schedule setting out alternative proposals. The yield would be reduced from 23-6 million to  15 million and the prospective return on capital from 8 per cent,to 7-1 per cent. Exchequer borrowing would increase from  46 million to 54 million and the extent of internal financing would be reduced from  103 million to  95 million.4.  The Cabinet may wish to accept these alternatives and also to agree (a) That the financial target for the Post Office in 1963-64 should be a return on net assets of 7-0 per cent.(b) That the Post Office investment figure for 1963-64 included in Cmnd. 1849be confirmed.5. I attach at Annex C a revised form of Statement appropriate to thealternative proposals.J. R. B.General Post Office, E.C. 1,4th December, 1962.1797a1Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1962C.

Annex CSTATEMENTIn accordance with Government policy for the nationalised industries, thePost Office has agreed to seek a reasonable return on net assets for 1962-63 andto aim at self-financing a fair proportion of its capital investment in 1963-64.Both last year and this year the finances of the Post Office have been adversely affected by a number of factors. In consequence the return on net assets mayfall below 6\ per cent, this year and 6 per cent, next year. As the House knows,the intention is that the net capital expenditure of the Post Office on fixed assetsshould rise from  105 million in 1960-61 to about  150 million in 1963-64.Investment on this scale is essential in order to give improved public services,notably a speedier telephone service, especially on trunks, a reduction in the telephone waiting list and improvements in postal services. On any view it is undesirable to cut back this capital investment.In order that the Post Office, with its substantial requirements for development,should continue to pay its way, I have considered tariff increases calculated toincrease income next year by  15 million or just over 2\ per cent.The principal changes I propose to make are:Telecommunications(a) The unit charge for STD calls will remain at 2d. but the time allowed for each unit charge will be changed. For all STD local calls, bothbusiness and residential, the time for each unit charge will be increased from 3 minutes to 6 minutes in the full rate period. For certainSTD trunk calls the time for each unit charge will be reduced by from17 per cent, up to 25 per cent.(b) For certain non-STD trunk calls the charge steps will be increased by amounts varying from 3d. to 9d. for 3 minutes.Some trunk charges for both STD and non-STD will not beaffected, especially from within a radius of 35 miles.(c) The charge for inland telegrams will be increased from 3d. to 5d. a word.The charges for certain overseas telegrams will also be increased.Postsid) Charges for inland parcels of 6 lb. and over will be increased on averageby about 6d. a parcel and those for oversea parcels, which vary according to destination, raised to bring them more in line with costs.At the same time, and in order to attract new business, the weight limit for inland parcels will be raised from 15 to 22 lb. There will be no increase in the charges for parcels weighing less than 6 lb.(e) The charge for registration will be increased by 3d. This should have theeffect of diverting more business to the cheaper Recorded DeliveryService, the growth of which I am anxious to encourage.if) Charges for overseas printed papers, which are incurring a heavy loss, willalso be increased.ig) The rates for inland money orders and the related cash on delivery chargeswill be increased by Is. Od. at each step in order to reduce the loss onthese services.With a view to attracting profitable (business, I have decided to introduce aHousehold Delivery Service for the delivery of unaddressed circulars and sampleson a door to door basis.Details of these changes will be published in the Official Report. Most ofthem will operate as from . . .December 1962.
