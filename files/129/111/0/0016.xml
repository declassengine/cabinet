THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of............................................TOP SECRET . Copy No.J.I.C.(62)93(Finalt),26th October, 1962 IMMEDIATEUK EYES ONLYCABINETJOINT INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEETHE THREAT POSED BY SOVIET MISSILES IN CUBAReport by the Joint Intelligence committeeObjectThe object of this short study is to comment on the USassessment of the Soviet offensive &quot;build-up in Cuba,Basis of Assessment2.     The assessment is based entirely on photographic evidenceso far released to us by the US authorities.       A firm UKassessment is difficult until more &quot;basic data is   availablefor detailed study &quot;by our own photo-interpreters.     Ourpreliminary comments below are based on the immediate advice ofstaff officers working in this field who have had a briefopportunity to study some of the more significant originalphotographic cover,     We would like to record here our appreciation-   of the US authorities for permitting tnis.Surface^to-Surface Missile Launch Sites3*      IRBM(a) US Position;    There are two launch areas locatedabout 25, make West of Havana, each of four pads,under construction, &quot;which might be ready for operational use by early December 1962*(b) Comment:    If these are IRBM they will have a range of 2200 nm, extending from Hudson Bay through .California to Lima, and be capable of striking a selection of strategic targets in the USA.     We aresatisfied that these two launch areas representsurface-to-surface missile sites capable of launchingmissiles with nuclear warheads*     On the basis of theevidence available we cannot positively identify the sites as being associated with the 2200 nm missile,,
If they are not associated with this missile we would expect them to be associated with a missile with a range of up to 1100 make,      In the case of these being1100 make missiles they would still be capable ofcovering an arc from Washington to  the Panama Canal,which would include many significant strategictargets in South East USA.      On the basis of theevidence available we cannot assess when the missileswill be operational,k*      MRBM(a) US Posi tion;    There are three launch areas locatedsome 50 nm South-West of Havana, each of four pads.These are of a simple type involving the minimum sitepreparation,.    Two are -judged to be operational, withmissiles and transporter/erectors in position.      Ineach case four missiles are on the pads and four moreare in a holding position,(b) Comment;    If these are MRBM sites with a range of1100 nm, they could strike targets from Washington &apos;to the Panama Canal, as described in para, 3(&quot;bJabove.     We do not disagree with the US assessmentbut in view of the apparently limited site prepara-tion there is the possibility that these sites are for the 650 nm missile.      If this were the case theywould cover the whole of the Florida peninsulaincluding Cape Canaveral,     On the basis of theevidence at present available we cannot assess whetherthe missiles are already operational,(c) US Position;    There are two more launch areas locatedabout 100 nm East of Havana,      These are a field type which require no permanent site preparation,   &apos; Theyare judged to be operational, with missile trailersand erector/launcher equipment present,(d) Comment;    We do not know the range allocated by theUS to missiles associated with these areas.    In viewof the nature of the site, we consider that these maybe for missiles with a range of about 300 nm and abletherefore to strike at installations in Key West,Because of the limited photography available to us weare unable to see the missiles themselves.     However,it must be assumed that they are there, in view ofthe associated equipment present; although on the basisof the evidence at present available we cannot assesswhether the missiles are already operational,Shore-to-Ship Missiles5,      (a)    US Position;    There are four launch areas; two 1+00nm East of Havana, one at Cabo Lucrecia and one onthe Isle of Pines,     These also each contain at least two launchers for cruise-type missiles and are-f judgedto be operational, with missiles on site,(b)    Comment;    We accept this assessment.     These weaponsare believed to be anti-ship and to have a range ofat least 30 nm.- 2
Surf ace-to-Air.-Missiles -6.      (a). US Position;    2k SA-2 sites each with six launchpositions are deployed,  with their acquisition and guidance radars,  throughout the length of Cuba,providing continuous cover of most of the island.17 of thesd sites are judged to be operational now.Two SAM support facilities have also been seen.(b)    Comment:    We accept this assessment.Naval Missiles7&apos;      (a)   US -Position:    There are 12 KOMAR-type patrol vessels,each mounting two launchers.Ob)    Comment;    These are primarily anti-ship missileswith .a range of 10-15 nm.      They could also be usedin support of land operations but the missile isbelieved to be limited to an H.E. warhead.Air-to-Air Missiles8*      (a)   H^Po^ition:    The presence of at least 39 FISHBEDfighters has been reported.(&quot;k)    Comment:    These could be a version capable ofcarrying air-to-air missiles. The range of this aircraft enables them to operate over the Floridapeninsula.Nuclear Warheads9.      (a)    US Position:    Some sites which are probably forstoring nuclear warheads are at present under construction.Comment:    We have no evidence on which to base a firm conclusion but we agree that these sites may befor the storing of nuclear warheads.      Neither wenor the US authorities have any evidence on which to judge whether nuclear warheads have or have not reached Cuba.Conclusions10.    Our conclusions at this stage are :-(a)    We are in agreement with the US authorities that a soviet MRBM capability is being built up in Cubawhich could, in our assessment, be up to 1100 nm range.Based on the evidence available we are not in aposition to assess whether the capability extends(as the US authorities believe) to the IRBM,  ioe.2200 nm.(b)    Provided nuclear warheads are available, missileunits in Cuba could be allocated certain strategic,targets on the American Continent at present allocated to other Soviet forces.      If all known sites are completed, we estimate that the overall Soviet initiallaunch capability against the US will have increasedsignificantly by the end of 1962.(Signed) HUGH STEPHENSONChairman,  on behalf ofThe Joint Intelligence Committee.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.26th October,  1962- 3 -TOP SECRET
