HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.16211.63 COPY NO19th October, 1962CABINET. 51WOLFENDBN REPORT ON SPORTMemorandum bj^ the Chief Secretary to the treasury and Paymaster general it is necessary for a decision to be taken and for an announce-ment to be made about our attitude to the recommendation to set up aSports Development Council in the Report on Sport and the Communitymade by a Committee under Sir John Wolfenden.    The thenChancellor of the Exchequer said that this recommendation would beconsidered in the House of Commons on 8th May, 1962.2.      On 13th July, 1962 the Home Affairs Committee after considering a paper by the then Financial Secretary, Treasury,accepted his view that we should not follow the Wolfendeh Committee&apos;recommendation to set up a Sports Development Council with the dutyof distributing public funds for the development of facilities for Sportand Pvecreation.     They preferred the course of leaving responsibilityfor public support in this matter to the Ministers now responsible,with some improvement in the co-ordinating machinery.     They also asked the Financial Secretary to revise the draft statement annexed tohis paper in the light of their discussion, in consultation with the other ministers concerned, and to circulate it to the Cabinet.3.      The Home Affairs Committee also discussed the case for an advisory committee (which would be a non-executive substitute for theWolfenden body, and concluded that whilst this was not strong on meritsit might have presentational advantages.     I am bound to say that further examination of the idea to my mind diminishes its attractionsstill further, for the following reasons -(i) It is unlikely to satisfy those who want to see aWolfenden body, with money to distribute, andit would have no real job to do.     The probability,in such a situation, is that it would eitherdevelop into a pressure group or become avisibly dead piece if wood.(ii) The selection of the Chairman and members would, considering the many conflictinginterests involved^ be a matter of particular difficulty;  and there would have to beseparate bodies for Scotland (perhaps also for Wales).
4.      These considerations have been strongly urged.by theMinister of Education, the Secretary of State for Scotland, and theMinister of Housing, who are to be responsible for supervising this expenditure;  and I myself think the arguments against an advisory body are very strong.5.      I therefore ask my colleagues to concur in my making astatement after the Recess in reply to a Written parliamentary question in the terms appended, omitting any reference to thepossibility of an Advisory Committee.J. A. B-C.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.18th October, 1962-2-
