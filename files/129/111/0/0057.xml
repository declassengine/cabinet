OCUMENT IS. THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)CABINETTAKEOVER BID FOR WHITEHEAD IRON AND STEELMemorandumbv, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and paymaster GeneralThe Iron and Steel Holding and Realisation Agency (LS, H. R. A. )have approached me on behalf of the nationalised firm of Richard thomas and Baldv/ins (R, T. B, ) about the implications for the company of thetakeover bid by Stewarts and Lloyds for the Vtfhitehead Iron and SteelCompany.2.    . Whiteheads are one of R. T. B&apos;s biggest customers, who takeannually some 10 to 11 per cent of R. T. B&apos;s total sales;  and over halfof the steel billets produced by R. T, Be at Redbourn (N. Lines. ) and west Waless     The companies have been closely associated for very many years.    R. T. B, have recently modernised their Redbourn works( at a cost of some  23 million in Government advances), with theapproval of the Iron and Steel Board, especially to ensure an adequate supply of billets and small slabs for the independent re-rollers (ofwhich Whiteheads are much the largest),3.     Stewarts and Lloyds have announced their intention of acquiringthe Whitehead shares.    I. S.H. R. A. have been assured that Whiteheadsdo not wish to be taken over;  but the shares are widely spread, andthe shareholders might well accept an offer.     The shares have risen from 28s. to around 54s. recently in anticipation of a takeover bid,4.      It must be assumed that if Stewarts and Lloyds acquiredWhiteheads-their purpose would be to use the capacity there to rollbillets from their own plants instead of from R. T. B.    It is expectedalso that the takeover bid for Whiteheads would be followed by takeoverbids for the smaller independent re-rollers.5.      There is no doubt that the effect of the Whitehead takeover onR. T. B. could be very serious.    I. S.H. R. A. estimate that if R. T. B- .are deprived of the Whitehead business their annual deficit will be worse by at least  1^ million:  and the Chairman of the company,Mr. Geoffrey Eley, reckons that the immediate consequence of lossof Whitehead&apos;s custom would be the closure cf R. T. B&apos;s Gowertonworks in West Wales, which employs 450 men, unemployment onvarying scales at Redbourn and Ebbw Vale, and the considerable financial loss too.COPY NO.
6.      The money involved must be considered in relation to thevalue of the shares - the l\ million  1 Ordinary Shares, at 50s. - 60s.a share would be &amp;.6^-$.7j million.7.      I am advised by I. S, H. R. A. that the R. T. B. board areunanimously and strongly of the opinion that every possible step should be taken to prevent a third party from acquiring Whiteheads;this might of course involve making a counter-bid when the terms of aStewarts and Lloyds bid are known, and the board have asked forI. S.H.R. A&apos;s support.    Sir William Lawson, the Chairman ofI. S.H.R. A. , who is our adviser in these matters of nationalisedsteel finance, assures us that this would be the inevitable commercialdecision for a privately owned firm in R. T. B&apos;s position.     I.S.H. R.A.are legally entitled to advance funds to R. T. B. for this purpose, orR. T. B. could borrow from the banks.    Either of these coursesrequire specific Government approval.8.      I have discussed with the Minister of Power, and we are agreed that there are fundamentally only two courses open to us.9.      The first is to accept the situation created by the Stewartsand Lloyds takeover bid when it comes, and to accept the loss toR. T. B. , which is of course in effect borne by the Exchequer, and the criticism that we have prevented a nationalised firm from taking theaction necessary to protect their commercial interest and our property.10.     The second is to seek to prevent the takeover.     The Ministerof Power and I are advised by the Agency that we could not hope to succeed in this course without the authority of the Cabinet, if necessary,to allow R. T. B. to make an offer for the Whitehead shares.    We are advised, and we fully accept this advice, that it would be impossibleto prevent Stewarts and Lloyds from carrying out their intentionsunless we were prepared, if Stewarts and Lloyds proved recalcitrant,to resist their takeover in this way.     If so authorised we would beable to see whether Stewarts and Lloyds would be prepared to compromise or to drop their proposal altogether, or whether itwould be better to enable R. T. B. to acquire the V/hitehead business.I hope that, if my colleagues decide to take this line, they would be willing to leave the tactical handling of this to the Minister of Powerand myself, with the advice of the Agency.11.     Politically, either course is difficult and embarrassing;   Iwould value my colleagues&apos; advice.J. A. B. -C.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.18th December, 1962.
