SERVICE ACTIVITIES IN THE UNIVERSITIESMemorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury- .and&apos; Paymaster GeneralThe Committee on Links between the Services and the universities have been discussing the future of the University air squadrons and the Officer Training Corps (O, T.Cs) in the universities.    It is agreed that the Air Squadrons have had some success in recruiting officers, that they secure valuable savings intraining costs, and that they should therefore be retained for afurther three years.     It is also agreed that the woman!s O. T. Cshave a derisory recruiting record and should be disbanded forth-with.      The Committee were not agreed about the male O. T. Cs.2.     The O0 T. Cs already cost  460, 000 a year and need anadditional  150,000 of new equipment.    For this cost they have produced no more than 73 recruits in nine years and four of theO, T. Cs have not produced a single one since 1953.     This, despite the fact that any young man who joins an O0 T. C. is, picima facie,already interested in a Service career.3.      In my view these units are now a waste of public money.The &quot;Service presence&quot; in the Universities will be maintained bythe Air Squadrons and abolition of the O. T. Cs would give us a useful saving on defence expenditure, at virtually no cost in theefficiency of our defences.J0 A. B-C.Treasury Chambers, S.
