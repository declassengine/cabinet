C (62) 173 Copy No.  5131st October, 1962CABINETSUPPLY OF CANBERRA BOMBERS TO PORTUGALMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in March 1962, after discussion of my memorandum C. (62) 54, it was decidedthat a licence could be granted for the supply of six B2 Canberra aircraft to Portugalif the Portuguese Government gave an assurance that the aircraft would not be usedin Africa. I was invited to ascertain what assurances the Portuguese Governmentwould give.2. It seems fairly certain that the Portuguese authorities would at least be willing to make a statement of the intended use of the aircraft when they place a firm order. To be suitable for Parliamentary purposes this would clearly have tobe confirmed to Her Majesty&apos;s Government by a Portuguese Minister. HoweverI should like to be allowed some discretion not to adhere rigidly to the formulathat the aircraft would not be used in Africa. It might be difficult to get thePortuguese to be so categoric and we might thus lose the contract. The main point, I think, is to satisfy ourselves that the Portuguese do not intend to use theseCanberras in Africa. In that case I do not think that we need more than an assurance which has Ministerial authority that the Portuguese Government had no intention of using the aircraft in their oversea territories except in the event of external aggression.3. My colleagues will also wish to be aware that the Portuguese authoritieshave now asked for a detailed offer for up to 25 of these aircraft. The british aircraft Corporation representative thinks that they will settle for not more than 16.I think that it would be better if the Portuguese broke the order up into two or moreparts and I propose that the British Aircraft Corporation should be asked to try to arrange this. But I hope that in any case the order can be approved. An orderof this magnitude would not only be useful for commercial reasons but helpful forour relations with the Portuguese in the context of our strategic requirements inthe Atlantic and Africa.H.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,31st October, 1962.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1962
