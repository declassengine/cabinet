HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C.1621.2013rd Da c emt* e r t 19,6 copy NO.51CABINETMODERNISATION OP BRITAINNote by the Acting Secretary of the CabinetBy direction of the Prime Minister I circulate, for theinformation of the Cabinet, the attached copy of a minute dated30th November which the Prime Minister has sent to the Chancellorof the Exchequer and to the Home Secretary,(Signed)  A. L. M. CARYCabinet Office, S. W. 1.3rd December, 1962MODE RNIS A TION OF BRITAINV/e have now reached a stage in our post-war history where some more radical attack must be made upon the weaknesses of our economy,both productive and structural.     We face a situation in which the conditionsof trade are becoming increasingly competitive and our commercialrivals increasingly better equipped to compete with us, while our owneconomy remains sluggish and &quot;patchy&quot;.     If we are to respond adequatelyto this challenge, we have to do two things:-(a) First, in order to enhance our competitive power and to ensure a level of exports commensurate with full employment at home, we have toincrease our productivity by bringing our productive capacity into full use, by eliminating restrictive practices and by developing to the utmostthe new methods which technology is bringing within our reach.     What-ever the result of the Brussels negotiations, thia need is urgent.    In orout of Europe, Britain needs to be brought up to date in almost everysphere of life.(b) Second, we have to re-organise the structure of the island insuch a way as to rectify the imbalance between south and north - betweenthe &quot;rich&quot; areas and the &quot;poor&quot; areas, the over-employed regions andthe under-employed regions - and redress the grave social anomalies-1-S EC RET
V   220which are created by this imbalance.    Hitherto our efforts in thisrespect have been mainly directed to influencing the economy as awhole!  and whether we have been concerned to stimulate it or to restrain it, our methods and techniques have been largely indiscriminate.But this concept of influencing the economy as a single entity has ledus to a situation in which, in order to reduce unemployment to an acceptable level in some areas, we have to stimulate excessive employ-ment in others.    And while, politically, the country may be able totolerate an average of 2 per cent, or even 3 per cent, of unemploymentoverall, it will not accept this if the figure is an average between 5 percent in one place and 1 per cent in another.I have been considering how we might make better use of ourmachinery of government for the dual purpose defined above.     Themain responsibility is shared between the Economic Policy Committeeand the Committee on Population and Employment;  and I hope that both of these Committees will press on as rapidly as possible withthe development of a coherent long-term policy, directed both-tomodernising and revitalising our productive capacity and methods andto ensuring a more balanced and healthy distribution of population andemployment throught the country.     I should like them to report progress,from the point of view of this long-term policy, not later than Easter.But we must also bend our energies to the short-term problem which now stares us in the face - the problem of an unused margin of productive resources and a sharp increase in regional unemployment.I have it in mind that, in order to deal with this situation, a smallinformal steering committee should be established, consisting of the chairmen of the two Ministerial Committees together with such other ministers as may from time to time be concerned, and meeting at regular and frequent intervals under my own chairmanship.     I should like the steering committee to hold its first meeting before the turn ofthe year, in order to agree on a selective programme of action, of animmediate and, perhaps, spectacular kind, which could be launched inthe very near future with good prospects of yielding practical results in the first six months of 1963.    For this purpose I should be glad ifyou would now arrange, as a matter of urgency, for a meeting of theCommittee over which you preside, in order that specific siiggestionsfor such a programme, framed in conformity with,the long-term policy,may be submitted to the steering committee by mid-December.    Onceapproved, they would be remitted back to your Committee, or to an appropriate sub-committee of it, for detailed implementation;  and Iwould propose that they should be announced, as evidence of, and support for, the general theme of &quot;The Modernisation of Britain&quot;, which I should like to launch very early in the New Year.There is a great deal to be done and to be done quickly.    I hopethat, as soon as our programme of action is settled, Ministers willhold themselves available during the Christmas   recess and will beprepared to devote their full energies to putting it into effect.H.M.,30th November, 1962-2-
