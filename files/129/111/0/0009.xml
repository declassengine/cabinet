CO!IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C..X62JL,1A? COPY NO. JSjL.17th October, 1962CABINETCIVIL, PUBLIC INVESTMENT:   WHITE PAPER, 1962Memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the treasury and Paymaster General&quot;We are under an obligation, following the practice of the lasttwo years, to publish a White Paper on public investment at thebeginning of the new Session of Parliament,  with   a view to a day&apos;debate before Christmas.     The accompanying draft, which has beenprepared after consultation with the Departments concerned, is circulated accordingly.2.     As last year, the &quot;White Paper will be in two parts - Part Idealing in general terms with civil public investment as a whole andFart II giving factual notes on the individual programmes.     In theattached draft, Part I is mainly devoted to an analysis of developments and an explanation of the Government1 s decisions in the field of public investment since the 1961 White Paper.3.      The draft White Paper is based, so far as public service invest-ment is concerned, upon the decisions taken in August this year(C. C.(62) 52nd Meeting, Minute 5);  but minor adjustments have since been made to some of the figures of expenditure, mainly as a result of re-estimation by Departments.     The figures for the nationalised industries are also based on decisions reached in the course of the year.Some changes in the figures may be called for if further decisions are taken before the document goes for final printing;  but apart fromelectricity (to which I refer below) any such changes are not likely to be large.4.

confidential this gives an increase of  120 million between 1962/63 and 1963/64.In his Mansion House speech on 3rd October, however, the&apos; Chancellorof the Exchequer referred to the probability of an increase of 175 million in the same period.     The difference between these twofigures is explained by the large potential claims for extra electricityinvestment in 1963/64, referred to in paragraphs 2 and 14 of the draft.This is still under discussion in respect of the related questions ofthe amount and of the return to be earned on the very large sums involved.5.      I invite my colleagues to agree to publication of a White paper on the lines of the attached draft, subject to any minor amendments which may be found necessary before fina.1 printing.J. A.

PART ONEPublic Investment 1960-641. This White Paper preserves the distinction first draw in &quot; Public Invest-ment in Great Britain October 1961&quot; (Cmnd. 1522) between(a) investment by the nationalised industries and public corporations and(b) public service investment by the central Government and localauthorities.Total Expenditure 1960-642. Public investment expenditure continues to grow rapidly. Between1955/56 and 1960/61 it rose from  1,275 million to  1,645 million. In1963/64 it is expected to reach a level of  2,055 million, without allowancebeing made for increased investment in electricity. As explained in para-graph 14 below, this expenditure is likely to add up to  70 million in1963/64.3. Expenditure between 1960/61 and 1963/64 is summarised in thefollowing table: details are given in Part Two:  	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63	1963/64	Actual	prices	March, 1962, prices					Estimated	fli if-111 t*n	Estimated	Forecast	expenditure,	vllt tUlll	out-turn	out-turn	1st October,				1962Investment by the nationalised in-				dustries and public corporations:				National Coal Board......	94	93	93	83Gas Council and Area Boards	43	46	56	64Electricity  Council,   Area				Boards and Scottish Boards	336	378	422	438(air Corporations     ......	47	37	37	50British Transport Commission	205	184	160	153Atomic Energy Authority	36	35	35	28Post Office     .........	100	119	123	-  139Other  ...      .........	6	10	8	10Total (rounded;    ......	865	905	935	965Public service investment:				Roads(J)        .........	98	108	133	144Education(3)   .........	142	164	187	198HousingC)     .........	279	296	317	348Water and sewerage......	79	88	99	105Hospital and local health and				welfare services     ......	43	56	65	78Other Investment:				Central Government^)	39	49	52	60Local Authorities^)	99	124	146	158Total (rounded)    ......	780	885	1,000	1,090Grand Total (rounded)	1,645	1,790	1,935	2,055(&apos;) Excluding the additional investment referred to in paragraph 14 below.O Including expenditure on unclassified roads and road lighting which is shown under&quot; Other local authority services &quot; in Part II (see pages 00-00).(3) Including university investment financed by the University Grants Committee.(4) Local Authorities, New Towns and housing associations.(5) For example, Government buildings, civil aerodromes and navigational services, prisons(see pages 00-00).(&quot;) For example, harbours, police and fire services (see pages 00-00).
4. Most programmes share in the big expansion of total public invest-ment between 1960/61 and 1963/64. The largest increases are in expehdi-ture on the electricity programme, on education, on housing and- on theaggregate of small local authority programmes ; but there are also sub-stantial increases in spending on roads, by the Post Office, on the health service, and on water and sewerage schemes.5. The rapid growth in the total of public service investment is a most striking feature in the general pattern of spending. Three-quarters of theincrease in total public investment over the period is in this category. Mostmarked are the increases in expenditure on education, housing, roads, andthe aggregate of small programmes.Out-turn of Expenditure in 1960j61 and 1961 / 626. The following table compares the annual totals of expenditure shown above with the totals given in October, 1961 (Cmnd. 1522):

7. The out-turn of expenditure in 1960/61 was close to the ejstim&amp;tegiven in Cmnd. 1522. The present estimate of out-turn in 1961/62 is alsoclose to the forecast of  1,75.5 million made in Cmnd. 1522 (arid to thetotal of  1,730 million given in Cmnd. 1203 in November, 1960) after adjust-ment for changes in price. Within the total, however, there are some pro-grammes where expenditure ran ahead of the estimates made in earlier years and others where expenditure fell behind.Out-turn of Expenditure in 1962/638. In 1961 the Government decided to hold back the rate of implement a-tion of a number of public investment programmes and to restrain the upward movement of investment expenditure in 1962/63. Their main aimwas to moderate the growth of new demand by the public sector uponproductive resources, including the construction industries. Special carewas taken not to disrupt work in hand or to interrupt the orderly executionof programmes.9. This action formed part of the series of measures taken by theGovernment in 1961 to relieve the pressure of internal demand and toincrease the long-term strength of the economy. The immediate objective of these measures was achieved. The pressures upon the nation&apos;s resourceshave been reduced and the balance of the economy improved.10. In the light of the general developments in the economy the Govem-ment have thought it appropriate to relax some of the more severe restraintsimposed last year upon the growth of public investment. They have accordingly approved additional work to be started in 1962/63 or 1963/64to a value of  70 million. Of this about  40 million is for housing,  5 million for university building,  10 million for school projects and othereducational schemes and  10 million for general local authority services(including facilities for sport and recreation). Most of the extra work isin those programmes where the period between planning and execution is comparatively short, and about  15 million of this  70 million is expectedto be spent in 1962/63. Increases have also been authorised in nationalised industries&apos; investment, particularly in investment on the gas and electricityprogrammes. These increases are partly offset by reductions in forecastexpenditure on other pragrammes, notably in investment by the british transport Commission.11. As a result of those changes total public investment expenditure in1962/63 is now estimated at  1,935 million. This represents a very slight increase upon the total shown in Cmnd. 1522 after adjustment for changesin price. The net increase is entirely in public service investment, which isnow expected to be some nine per cent, higher at constant prices than in1961/62.Estimated expenditure in 1963/6412. The Government have decided that a further substantial increase in public investment is called for in 1963/64. The estimated total of expendi-ture shown in this White Paper is  2,055 million, some  120 million, or six per cent., greater than the forecast out-turn for 1962/63.7
13. Of the total increase between the two years about one-quarter isin investment by the nationalised industries and public corporations, whichwill make a direct contribution to the expansion of the economy. Theprincipal increases are in expenditure on the gas programme, mainly on the project for importing liquified natural gas, on the electricity programmes,by the Air Corporations and by the Post Office. These are partly offset b.yfurther reductions in the estimated investment needs of the National coal board, the British Transport Commission, and the Atomic Energy Authority.14. Besides the increase in electricity investment specifically shown, thereis the prospect that additional investment will be needed to keep pace Iwiththe growing demand for electricity The Central Electricity Generating Boardiare reviewing requirements for the development of generation and trans-mission facilities in the light of the latest information. In addition, pro^posals from the Area Boards for strengthening distribution facilities areiunder consideration. In total this could add up to  70 million to, investment expenditure in 1963/64.15. The larger part of the increase shown in this White Paper for 1963/64compared with 1962/63, however, falls in public service investment. On27th February, 1962, the Chancellor of the Exchequer told the House ofCommons (Official Report, Col. 1137) that the Government were working to plans which would permit an increase of about six per cent, in theaggregate of public service investment between 1962/63 and 1963/64. Tak-ing account of the additional work described in paragraph 10 above, whichwill add  40 million to expenditure in 1963/64, the total now estimated for that year is nine per cent, higher than the forecast outturn for 1962/63.This greater increase is, in the Governmenfs view, justified by the generaleasing of the strain on the economy which has taken place in recent monthsland by the trend of private investment as well as by the merits of the pro-grammes concerned. Nevertheless, as a safeguard against the difficultieswhich held up the. implementation of some investment programmes in 1961,they are taking what steps are sensible and practicable to ensure that, asfar as possible, the additional building investment authorised is undertaken in those parts of the country where the pressure on resources is least.16. The largest single increase is in the housing programme, where theGovernment have made special provisions for a new drive to clear slumdwellings. But all the main programmes share in the general expansion.Expenditure financed through the University Grants Committee for thecapital development programme of the universities now gathering momentumwill be up by about 25 per cent, and there *will be a continued increase ofexpenditure on the long-term programmes of road and hospital construc-tion, water and sewerage, and local health and welfare. Provision is also made for increased capital expenditure on schools, further education andon teacher training and on the smaller investment programmes executed cen-trally and locally.

Investment by the National Coal Board mainly comprises expendi-ture for promoting efficiency (e.g. face mechanisation and workshops), for maintaining existing capacity and for completing schemes for new deep-mined capacity, for processing coal, for houses and other ancillary opera-tions as well as for replacing plant no longer useful or economic.17. With the progress made in the reconstruction of the Industry, themumber and estimated cost of new major schemes has declined over recentyears as the following table shows:  Major Capital Schemes Approved : 1957-1961Number        Estimated Capital Cost m.1957......      ...        44 67.519581959196019612114121136.913.611.65.018. During the last year there has been an increase in output and amarked improvement in productivity. This has been due to increased facemechanisation, to concentration and to more extensive use of two and threeshift Iworking as well as to the benefits of the completion of past reconstruc-Ition schemes. As a result, the Board have now, and in prospect, enoughprimary capacity (i.e. physical facilities in the shape of shafts, main road-ways and major equipment) to meet the highest demand for coal likely tOjOccur in the foreseeable future. So much progress has now been made thatjsome reduction can be foreseen over the next few years on schemes toprovide primary capacity. On the other hand, technical developments in face mechanisation and other fields designed further to raise operating effi-ciency are likely to require increased expenditure. On balance these factorsare likely further to reduce expenditure in 1962/63 from the latest (April,1962) forecast of  93 million to  90 million and expenditure for 1963/64 isnow estimated at  83 million.19. By the end of 1961 the Board had spent  427 million on capital account on major colliery schemes (schemes costing over  250,000). Of this sum, about  163 million is accounted for by expenditure upon 173 major
schemes substantially completed at the end of 1961 and  264 million byExpenditure so far incurred upon 123 uncompleted schemes. Of the-14major schemes approved in 1961, 5 related to collieries and 6 to ancillarydevelopments. The bulk of the expenditure in 1963/64 will be upon schemes already in progress.20. The prime object of the Board&apos;s colliery investment is to maintainadequate primary capacity and to reduce operating costs, first by sub-stituting new and reconstructed primary capacity for old or exhaustedcapacity, and secondly, by increasing mechanisation. It is expected thatthe proportion of coal produced from new and reconstructed pits will rise from 54  per cent, in 1961 to some 80 per cent, in 1965 and that mechanisedoutput will increase from 48 per cent, to 80 per cent, of total output overthe same period. The following table analyses the Board&apos;s total invest-ment expenditure between its different activities:.-  million					1960/61	1961/62	1962/63	1963/64Collieries and associated activities ...

Expenditure on ancillary activities in the next twoyears consists principally of the provision of houses and smokeless fuelplants.21. The distribution between Divisions of the expenditure in 1963/64on collieries is expected Iby the Board to be as follows:  Division   millionScottish      ............      ...      8-northern (N. &amp; C.)       ......      ...      2-3Durham     ......      .........      5-north Eastern      ...      ......      ...     14-0North Western      ............      4-7East Midlands......      ...      ...     14-9West Midlands     .........      ...      7-south Western     ...      ......      ...    11-south Eastern      ...      .........      0-5Total      .........    70-gas Council and Area Boards  million	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63	1963/64Gas manufacture     ...      .........	15-4	16-2	21-5	23-4Distribution and consumer services......	25-1	26-0	30-2	37-other..................	2-8	3-9	4-3	3-6Total   ...      ..........	43-3	46-1	56-0	64-0The net book value of fixed assets shown in the balance sheets of the Gas Council and area Boards at 31st March, 1962, was  512 million.
22. Investment by the gas industry in Great Britain comprises, expendi-ture toy the twelve Boards on gas manufacture and distribution, and bythe Gas Council on research (included under the head of other expenditurein the table).23. Tdtal invesitrnenit by the indusltry in 1961/62 Was  46-1 million, coin-pared with  47 million estimated in October, 1961 (Cmnd. 1522). sales of gas in 1961/62 were 2-7 per cenlt. higher than in the previous year.Although the .coMer winter caused some of Ms increase, there are signs that the demand for gas, after toeing fairly stable for a few years, is nowrising. Future investment must therefore provide for additional supplies to meet the mare rapid increase in demand now expected as well as for reduction of costs.24. The asltimalte of investment in 1962/63 given in October, 1961 (Cmnd.1522) was  48-8 million. Following the approval in November, 1961 ofthe industry&apos;s proposal to import liquefied natural gas, this was increasedto  52-5 million, as shown in the White Paper on Government ExpenditureBelow the Line 1962/63 (Cmnd. 1680). The further revision to  56 millionresults largely from re-phasing of expenditure on the natural gas project,the re-assessment of the future demand for gas, and the need to replacesupplies from discontinued or uneconomic sources.25. In 1963/64, when most of the expenditure on the project for importing liquefied natural gas will toe incurred, investment is expectedto rise further to  64 million. It is expected, however, that, even with a continued increase in demand for gas, the industry&apos;s annual investment in 1964/65 will be lower than in the two preceding years. Total invest-ment over the seven-year period of the development plan set out inGas Looks Ahead (1st April, 1959 to 31st March, 1966) is not expected todiffer materially from the then estimated total of  352 million.Electricity Council and Boards in England and Wales  million	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63	1963/64Central Electricity Generating Board Generation: Conventional Stations.........

Investment by the Electricity Supply Industry in England andWales comprises expenditure by the Central Electricity Generating Boardon generating stations and the main transmission system, and by the twelve Area Boards on local distribution.27. The forecasts of demand for electricity, on which the capital pro-grammes are based, are reviewed each year. The 1962 review showed the
need for a further increase in the forecasts. Estimates of the consequentral-increases required in the capital programme of the Electricity Boards willbe considered by the Government later in the year. As explained in para-graph 14 an increase of up to  70 million in investment in 1963/64 mayibe required. At 31st March, 1962, the total output capacity of theGenerating Board&apos;s power stations was 28,959 MW. At the end of 1962the outpuit capacity of the Board&apos;s stations is expected to be nearly31,400 MW and at the end of 1963 nearly 33,700 MW. It is expectedthat over 14,600 MW of new plant will be commissioned in the years1962-66 inclusive. On present estimates a rate of commissioningsubstantially higher than this will be required in the years after 1966 tokeep pace with the growing demand, and this, together with the associatedirransmission work required, will be reflected in the Generating BoaTd&apos;srevised investment programme.28. Increases in forecasts of demand, together with the need to prevent any increase in the backlog of work on the distribution systems, have ledto tlie increase in the Area Boards&apos; capital programmes for 1962/63 andare expected to lead to further increases in 1963/64. An increasing propor-tion, already more than 50 per cent., of the Area Boards&apos; capital expenditure,is required to cope with the growing demands of existing consumers. Therate of expenditure on new connections is increasing only slightly.29. Total investment in fixed assets by the Generating and Area boards in 1961/62 was  6-4 million or about 2 per cent., more than was estimated in October, 1961 (Cmnd. 1522). The present estimate of  357 million for total investment in 1962/63 is  22-1 million higher than the estimate given inOctober, 1961. This increase is accounted for by a rise of  13 million in expenditure by the Generating Board, mainly on conventional powerIstations, and a irise of  9-1 million in expenditure by Area Boards, onaccount of the increased growth of demand.30. Estimated expenditure on nuclear fuel in 1962/63 is  4-6 millionlower than the estimate given in Cmnd. 1522, mainly because of therephasing of payments to the Atomic Energy Authority.31. Total investment, including nuclear fuel, in 1962/63 is estimatedat  373-0 million,  17-5 million above the estimate given in Cmnd. 1522.The Minister has reviewed the industry&apos;s present capital development programme, and has approved the revised level of expenditure for 1962/63.As already indicated the figures for 1963/64 will be subject to review later in the year.South o  Scotland Electricity Board  million	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63	1963/64Generation:				Conventional stations      .........	5-7	6-0	6-5	8-0Nuclear station     ............	10-7	12-9	90	2-5Main Transmission............	3-4	6-5	6-5	6-5Distribution and other       .........	7-4	9-0	100	100Total fixed assets      ......	27-2	34-4	320	27-0Nuclear fuel (initial charges).........	. 	- -	. - &apos;	70Total   ...      ......	27-2	34-4	320	34-0The net book value of fixed assets shown in the balance sheet of the South of scotland electricity Board at 31st December, 1961, was  181 million.
32. The demand for electricity in Scotland continues to grow with greatrapidity. After an increase of 16-3 per cent! in the maximum demand inthe South of Scotland in 1960, a further rise of no less than 18 per cent, wasrecorded in 1961. 56 MW of output capacity were added to the Board&apos;sgenerating plant in 1961 ; 188 MW should be added in 1962 and a further,656 MW are under construction.33. The progress of the second half of the coal-fired generating station at Kincardine was delayed by labour troubles during &apos;the summer of 1962.As a result, the first of the two turbo-alternators (each of which will havean output capacity of 188 MW) is unlikely to be ready to meet the winterpeak although the Board hope to commission it this winter; the secondshould be ready next year. Good progress is now being made on Hunterstonand commissioning of both nuclear reactors can be expected in 1964. the investment figures for this station reflect the Board&apos;s reassessment of the expected final cost. The construction of two further conventional stationshas been authorised and work on them has been in progress for somemonths. The larger of these is a coal-fired station at Cockenzie, EastLothian, with an output capacity of 1,112 MW provided by four turbo-alternaitors, one to be commissioned in 1966, two in 1967 and the fourth in1968; the commissioning&apos; dates for the third and fourth sets are a yearearlier than was formerly planned and this accounts for most of the increasein investment in conventional stations in 1963/64. The smaller is a 56 MWsteam station at Methill in Fife which will burn colliery slurry and is due for commissioning in 1965 and 1966.34. Heavy investment on main transmission and distribution is requiredto meet the exceptional growth of demand. While some acceleration ofwork on the 275 kV super grid has been necessary the main increase is dueto the urgent need for reinforcement of existing &quot;transmission anddistribution systems.North olt Scotland Hydro-Electric Board  million	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63	1963/64Generation    ...............	7-4	8-6	11-4	8-9Main transmission    ............	10	1-6	1-9	1-6Distribution   ...............	2-7	3-3	3-6	3-6Total   .........	11-1	13-5	16-9	14-1The net book value of fixed assets shown in the balance of sheet of the North of ScotlandHydro-Electric Board at 31st December, 1961, was  200 million.35. The North of Scotland has experienced a high rate of growth in demand similar to that in South Scotland, and the Board has had to adjustits investment programme to keep pace with this and at the same time tomaintain its contracted sale of 344 MW of peak load power to the SouthBoard in 1963/64. The Board is to commission hydro plant with an output capacity of 74 MW in 1962 and 89 MW in 1963. A further 400 MW ofpumped storage hydro plant and 228 MW of steam plant are under construction.
36: The two main hydro schemes at present under construction areStratbfarrar and Kilmorack (102 MW) with four conventional power stations and Awe (440 MW) with two conventional stations and the Gruachanpumped storage station. All of the conventional hydro stations will becommissioned in 1962 and 1963. At Cruachan two of the four 100 MW setsare expected to be commissioned in 1965 and the other two in 1966.37. The steam plant is being installed at an extension of the Dundeepower station ; this will consist of two oil fired sets each of 114 MW output capacity. The commissioning of these sets is scheduled for 1965 and 1966,the second set having been brought forward from 1969.38. There is an increase of transmission and distribution work to reinforce the system to meet higher loads. 275 kV work in the north is well advanced,while construction was recently started on a new line between Cruachanand the Glasgow area.Air Corporations_   million	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63	1963/64British Overseas Airways Corporation Aircraft and spares............

The capital investment programmes of the Air Corporations arefounded on their plans for replacing or expanding their fleets of aircraft.These are designed to enable B.O.A.C. and B.E.A to maintain or improve their position in relation to other major world airlines and to achieve their aim of earning a reasonable yield in relation to capital employed.40. There may be an interval of five or six years between the orderingof a new aircraft type and its coming into service. During this interval the corporations make periodical payments to the manufacturers for aircraftunder construction. Both B.O.A.C. and B.E.A. are investing capital inthis way on their next generation of aircraft. Fluctuations in their expendi-&apos;ture from year to year reflect the phasing of the payment plans agreed with the manufacturers. The results of this investment cannot be measureduntil the aircraft are brought into full operational service.41. Estimated expenditure by B.O.A.C. during 1962/63 and 1963/64 willbe largely progress payments on V.C.10 aircraft, of which 42 are on order for delivery during 1963/64 to 1965/66. Investment in buildings, plant andequipment will be mainly on preparations for putting the V.C.10 into service ;
these include the extension of hangar and workshop accommodation atLondon Airport and of engine overhaul facilities at Treforest.42. Estimated expenditure by B.E.A. during 1962/63 and 1963/64 willbe mainly progress payments on Trident aircraft, of which 24 are on order for delivery during, 1963/64 to 1965/66. Some provision has also been included for other possible aircraft requirements. Investment in buildings,&apos; plant and equipment is mainly on the erection of the permanent West LondonAir Terminal at Cromwell Road and on the acquisition of plant and facilitiesfor the new aircraft types being introduced.43. The figures for investment by B.O.A.C in 1961/62 and 1962/63compare with estimates of  14-9 million and  23 million given in October,1961 (Cmnd. 1522): the figures for investment by B.E.A. in these two yearscompare with estimates of  29-4 million and  14-2 million given in October,1961 (Cmnd. 1522). The differences are the result of rephasing of progresspayments on aircraft and a shortfall in expenditure during 1961/62 on buildings, plant and equipment, which in the case of B.E.A. has been offset by an increase in forecast expenditure in 1962/63.British Transport Commission  million*	1960	1961	1962	1963British Railways				Building, works and plant.........	75-8	71-1	55-4	56-5Rolling stock:				Locomotives......	45-3	41-0	40-0	38-0Coaching stock......      ...	28-3	18-6	11-0	7-5Freight stock     ...      .........	12-3	14-0	12-0	60Collection and delivery vehicles .......	1-1	1-2	2-5	2-5Ships...............	3-1	1-8	\.    9*0	9 .ftPacket ports............      ...	0-5	0-4		Hotels and catering services       ...	1-2	1-5	1-6	1-other services	0-4	0-3	0-8	1-0Total   .........      ...	1680	149-9	125-3	115-other Undertakings^			14-8	London Transport.........	15-0	-   14-4		17-7Docks       ...............	8-0	6-2	6-2	5-8Inland waterways .........      ...	2-5	1-7	1-7	2-british Road Services      .........	5-7	4-9	5-2	5-5Provincial and Scottish buses     ......	5-1	5-6	6-1	6-other services............	0-8	1-0	0-4	0-9Total   ...	37-1	33-8	34-4	38-4Total   ......	205-1	183-7	159-7	153-4The net book value of fixed assets shown in the balance sheet of the British transport commission at 31st December, 1961, was  2,045 million.* The figures in this table relate to calendar years.t Under the Transport Act, 1962, these will vest, respectively, in the London transport board the British Transport Docks Board, the British Waterways Board, and (in the caseof the British Road Services, Provincial and Scottish Buses and &quot; Other services &quot;) in theTransport Holding Company.44. Under the new organisation of the Commission^ undertakingsdescribed in Reorganisation of the Nationalised Transport Undertakings
(Cmnd. 1248), presented to Parliament in December, 1960, and now providedfor in the Transport Act 1962, British Railways and certain associatedactivities will be placed under a British Railways Board and the.other undertakings will be either made independent or grouped under a holding company. The table shown above is in a form which accords with this new organisation, which is expected to take effect on 1st January, 1963.45. As foreshadowed in October, 1961 (Cmnd. 1522, paragraph 51), theCommission^ total requirements for 1961 proved somewhat greater than theoriginal estimate of  175 million. The bulk of the increase of  8-7 million was in expenditure on the railways and was the result partly of paymentsfalling earlier than originally expected and partly of faster progress than firstestimated on some major schemes.46. Total investment by the Commission in 1962 is now estimated at 159-7 million, that is  17-5 million below the estimate given in October,1961 (Cmnd. 1522). The difference is mainly in expenditure on the railways,where only a few new major works, which are demonstrably worthwhile, arebeing authorised pending a reasonably assured definition of the future size and shape of the system. Apart from the London Midland electrificationproject and the extension of diesel traction, expenditure is confined mainly to essential replacements and to the completion of works in progress as quickly as is consistent with the economic use of resources.47. The figures for investment in the nationalised transport undertakings in 1963 are the result of careful reviews, carried out by the Ministry ofTransport in conjunction with the British Transport Commission and withHhe undertakings themselves, of the prospects of the undertakings and the justification for their new [investment proposals. An important element inthese reviews has been the extent to which the proposed investment will contribute towards the Government^ aims and objectives for each of the undertakings.48. The reduced figure for investment by the British Railways in 1963reflects the present uncertainties about the future of the railway system.As in 1962, planned expenditure is confined mainly to essential replace-ments and to works in progress. Total investment will therefore fall aswork in progress is brought to completion and is not replaced by equivalentnew work. When an assessment has been made of the traffic studiesrecently carried out by the railways, decisions will be required upon theextent and timing of future new investment.49. Provision is made in the estimate for a start to be made on theconstruction by London Transport of the new Victoria Tube Line, recentlyauthorised by the Government, Major programmes for the replacement of underground rolling stock and road vehicles for London Transportcontinue. Rehabilitation of the facilities for generating and distributingelectric current accounts for a further large part of their expenditure.50. Work continues on the modernisation and improvement of dockfacilities. As in previous years, most of the expenditure on road passenger and goods undertakings is upon the replacement of vehicles, though someexpenditure will be on bus stations and depot facilities.   Most of the
expenditure on waterways is upon essential maintenance, though there willbe some further spending on the uncompleted programme of improvingselected waterways and associated facilities.Atomic Energy Authority  million	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63	1963/64Land and buildings.........	16-4	15-5	13-9	11-plant and machinery............	19-3	19-5	20-9	16-8Total   ...      ...      ......	35-7	35-0	34-8	28-0The net book value of fixed assets shown in the balance sheet of the Atomic energy authority at 31st March, 1961, was  278-5 million. The fixed assets of the NationalInstitute for Research in Nuclear Science, valued at cost and with no allowance for depreciation, amounted to  8 - 9 million at the same date.51. In addition to investment by the Atomic Energy Authority, thefigures shown above include investment by the National Institute for research in Nuclear Science, and all capital expenditure on the EuropeanNuclear Energy Agency&apos;s experimental reactor (DRAGON) at WinfrithHeath, which is financed by contributions from the Authority and member countries. The Authority&apos;s share of the expenditure is financed from the atomic Energy Vote (Class VII, Vote 3).52. Some investment continues on plant for manufacturing fuel elementsfor the nuclear power programme and for reprocessing them afterirradiation. The major part of the Authority&apos;s investment, however, isnow concerned with their research and development programme, the primaryaim of which is to establish reactor systems capable of generating electricityas cheap as, and subsequently cheaper than, electricity generated by coal and oil burning power stations. The programme includes the prototypeadvanced gas-cooled reactor (A.G.R.), which has been completed this yearand is being commissioned. It also includes proposals for developingand building prototypes of a heavy water moderated reactor and a largefast reactor incorporating the knowledge gained on the Dounreay experi-mental fast reactor.53. In the research field, work has started on a new variable energycyclotron at Harwell. Building work is now well advanced on the second phase of Culham Laboratory, the Authority&apos;s centre for plasma physicsresearch, the objective of which is to generate power from fusion reactions.54. The bulk of the expenditure by the National Institute for research in Nuclear Science will be on the continuing construction of the 7GeVproton synchrotron (NIMROD) for fundamental nuclear physics researchby universities and other, bodies. There will, however, also be expenditureon the purchase of an ATLAS digital computer for use by universities, the atomic Energy Authority, Government Departments and the Institute, andon the start of construction of a new laboratory in the north of england to house a 4GeV electron synchrotron.

A survey of current Post Office plans was included in the white paper &quot; Post Office Prospects 1962163 &quot; (Cmnd. 1653). In terms of moderni-sation and development the main objectives for the inland telecommunications-cations services are to complete by 1970 the conversion of the remaining700 manual exchanges to automatic working and to extend subscriber trunkdialling to nearly all telephones by the same date. By March, 1963, 87 percent, of the country&apos;s subscribers will have automatic service and about one-third will have subscriber trunk dialling facilities. a third main element of the plans for these services is the expansion of the inland telephone system to meet traffic growth (especially in the trunkservice) and new demands for telephone service. In addition investment is required for the continuing expansion of the telex and private telegraph services. In the overseas telecommunications field the principal objectivesare continued expansion of the submarine cable network to meet trafficgrowth and to improve service, and participation in experiments withsatellite communications. The investment in postal plant and machineryreflects the growth of mechanisation in sorting offices and the developmentof new machines for handling the mails.56. The figures in the tables exclude Post Office expenditure in NorthernIreland, on the provision of television links for the BBC and ITA andin connection with road improvement works.Other Public Corporations  million	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63	1963/64British Broadcasting Corporation......

Investment by the British Broadcasting Corporation is normallyfinanced from the Broadcasting Vote (Class IV, Vote 13); the greaterpart is for the home services, for which the amount of the Vote is related
to licence revenue. Provision is mainly for the extension and improve-ment of coverage of the television and very high frequency sound broad-casting services, and for new and improved buildings and equipment.58. Investment toy the Independent Television Authority is financed from the Authority&apos;s own resources ; it has the object of extending cover-age and improving reception. The figures for tooth the BBC and theITA include the cost of the work undertaken by the Post Office for theprovision of television links.59. Additional investment will be needed for the developments inthe broadcasting services outlined in the White Paper &quot; Memorandum on theReport of the Committee on Broadcasting 1960 &quot; (Cmnd. 1770).60. Investment, toy the Covent Garden Market Authority may be financed out of revenue, toy raising capital on its own credit, or, for thefirst ten years of its operations, by loans from the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food. In 1961/62 about  3-9 million was paid as com-pensation for the market lands vested in the Authority. Further expen-diture will depend on the Authority&apos;s choice of a site for a new market,but none is expected before the end of 1963/64.Public Service InvestmentRoads  million	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63	1963/64England and Wales Motorways ............

61. The table shows capital expenditure on motorways and on trunkand classified roads.  Capital expenditure on unclassified roads and of rail-forms of road lighting is included in the table of other capital expenditure by local authorities (page     ).62. The Ministry of Transport in England and Wales and the scottish development Department in Scotland are responsible for the building of trunk roads and motorways on &apos;trunk routes ; expenditure is met entirely from Exchequer funds (Class IV, Votes 11 and 12). The local authori-ties are responsible for the building of classified roads, and expenditure ismet partly by the local authorities and partly from Exchequer grants.63. The table shows a steady and very substantial increase in capitalexpenditure on road construction and improvement. Further expansionis envisaged under the programme approved by the Government for thefive years 1967/68, during which period approximately  590 million in England and Wales and  71 million in Scotland. In addition the localtauthorities will be spending approximately  82 million in England andWales and  9 million in Scotland.64. The first aim of the road programme in England and Wales, is toprovide a network of fast, safe roads between the chief cities and towns,the industrial areas and the ports. A considerable part of the increasingprogramme is devoted to improving communications with and within areasof relatively high unemployment. For instance the rate of expenditure inthe North East will be doubled and communications with London, the Mid-lands and the ports greatly improved. A large and expanding road pro-gramme takes time to get fully under way but by March, 1964, it isexpected that 292 miles of motorway will be open to traffic and that, sincethe inception of the present long term programme in 1961, 206 miles of trunk roads will have been modernised. The higher standards called for by the growth in iroad traffic, for example, more complex road structures,including underpasses and flyovers, and the additional mileage of dualcarriageway mean that fewer road improvements can be undertaken withthe same amount of money.65. The second main objective is to provide the new or improved roadsneeded to cope with the greatly increased traffic in urban areas. This willtake longer to achieve ; but in some areas, such as Birmingham, Bristol,Coventry, Huddersfield and Leicester, substantial progress will have beenbeen made by March, 1964, in easing urban congestion by the constructionof inner ring roads or other major improvements. In London several important schemes will have been completed or virtually completed, includ-ing the Park Lane Improvement Scheme, Stage Two of the Elephant andCastle scheme, improvement of the Holborn Kingsway junction, the Kings-way Tunnel, and the Blackfriars Bridgehead underpass. In addition, to&apos;speed through traffic and also to relieve the pressure of traffic in theLondon and Newcastle areas, new tunnels are being built under the Thamesat Dartford and Blackwall and under the Tyne at Jarrow.66. In Scotland the trunk road programme aims at the provision, bythe early 1970&apos;s, of some 240 miles of dual-carriageway all-purpose roads and motorways connecting the main industrial centres with a linkto the English motorway system through Carlisle.   By March, 1964, it is
expected that about one-third of the carriageway will be completed or inhand.67. The main aims of the proposed investment in classified roadsare the completion of the Clyde Tunnels and Forth road bridge, the pro-vision of a road bridge across the river Tay at Dundee, the continuingimprovement of the more important roads in the Highlands and Islands andthe further building and improvement of roads in the counties and towns(including new towns) to meet the needs of increased traffic.University Grants Committee  million	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63	1963/64Land and buildings   ...      ......	16-5	21-4	24-2	30-8Plant and equipment.........	3-9	4-8	7-3	7-8Total   ............	20-4	26-2	31-5	38-668. Funds are Voted annually by Parliament (Class VII, Vote 1)for Exchequer grants to the universities. These include capital (or non-recurrent) grants for the erection of new, and the adaptation of existing,buildings, including professional fees, equipment and the purchase of sites and properties. Details of the major schemes in progress and of schemesdue to start in the current yeax are given in the Appendix to the 1962/63Estimates.69. The rapidly expanding expenditure on this programme is to sup-port the great expansion in numbers of students now in progress. Thereare at present about 115,000 full time students at universities in GreatBritain ; and the Government have expressed their wish that the additional funds now being made available should be applied so far as possible toachieving a figure of about 150,000 full time students in 1966/67, whenthe universities will be feeling the full effect of the post-war increase inthe birthrate. Such an increase in numbers, equivalent to 35 per cent, in five years, will ensure university places for as great a proportion of theage-group from which university students are selected as at present, despitea rapid expansion of the total number in this age group.Education   million	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63	1963/64England and Wales Buildings: Primary and secondary schools Further education       ......

70. The greater part of this expenditure is undertaken by local educationauthorities, working within allocations administered by the Ministry ofEducation and the Scottish Education Department. Expenditure bjTlocaleducation authorities is, for the most part, financed by borrowing, andthe loan charges, together with capital expenditure from revenue, are takeninto account in fixing the general grant.71. In terms of starts the value of major school building projects inEngland and Wales averaged over  60 million a year in the two-year period1960-62 and in 1962/63 is likely to be about  65 million. For 1963/64starts of  55 million have been authorised. These are the first four ofthe five years covered by the White Paper &quot;Secondary Education for Alla New Drive &quot; (Cmnd. 604), presented to Parliament in. December, 1958. Aconsiderable proportion of these annual programmes is needed on accountof increases or shifts of population, but it is also hoped to complete the elimination of all-age schools in the 1964/65 programme and to give somepriority to the provision of additional science laboratories. Some progress will also be made with modernising or replacing the school buildings which fall seriously below modern standards, preference being given to secondary schools. A survey of all maintained schools in England and Wales is being undertaken to assist in determining future requirements for this type ofcapital investment.72. About  2 million a year is being spent on the development of colleges of Advanced Technology. These are no longer financed by local educationauthorities but receive direct grants from the Ministry. Other capitalexpenditure on further education is mainly for building new technical colleges and major extensions. Special emphasis continues to be given tofacilities for the education of craftsmen and technicians. There is evidenceof pressure of numbers increasing in many technical colleges and a survey of premises is being undertaken to assess the degree of overcrowding.73. The most important element of expenditure on other educationalservices is the expansion of teacher training colleges. This amounted to 10^ million in 1961/62, is likely to cost about  10 million this year and about  7^ million in 1963/64. The capacity of the colleges has alreadybeen increased by 12,000 places since 1960 and work designed to increasecapacity by a further 12,000 places is under way.74. In each of the years 1962/63 and 1963/64 some  4 million isexpected to be spent on youth service buildings and on projects for sportand recreation within the sphere of the education service. The latter areadditional to the playing fields and gymnasia forming part of the normalprovision for schools and colleges.75. The restrictions on minor works (up to  20,000) imposed in 1961have now been eased. Authorised starts have been increased to  16 million in both 1962/63 and 1963/64.76. The sharp increase in expenditure on land, plant, equipment andfees in 1961/62 compared . with the previous year and with the figures given in Cmnd. 1522 is mainly accounted for by an increase in estimated expenditure on land. Other items follow the trend of expenditure on building.77. In Scotland the pattern of expenditure continues to be broadly similartp that in England and Wales.   The provision for school building is based
on the five-year programme envisaged in the White Paper &quot;Education inScotland The Next Step &quot; (Cmnd. 603), presented to Parliament in December,1958. Expenditure on further education instead of rising quite steeplyin 1961/62, as was expected, rose comparatively little. It is,/however,expected that the work which was not done in 1961/62 will be overtakenin 1962/63 and as a result capital expenditure for this year will show asubstantial increase. The programme for the expansion of teacher training colleges is now likely to prove larger than was originally planned and tobe spread over a longer period. Provision has also been made for someexpansion of youth service facilities.Housing   million	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63	1963/64England and Wales............	236 0	252-9	267-1	294-3Scotland        ...............	43 0	43-3	50-3	54-078. The housing programme covers capital expenditure by localauthorities, by housing associations (including the Scottish Special housing association), and by new town development corporations and the Com-mission for the New Towns. Capital expenditure on dwellings foremployees of the public sector is not included; provision for this is madeunder the respective programmes. In addition to new building, the pro-gramme includes the costs of the acquisition of land and buildings and of improvements carried out by local authorities and by housing associationson their own dwellings.79. Expenditure is financed mostly by borrowing. Borrowing by localauthorities is subject to the issue of loan sanction by the Minister of housing and Local Government or the Secretary of State for Scotland. Housing asso-ciations, in certain circumstances, may borrow from local authorities to finance their investment; they may also receive advances from the Ministerof Housing and Local Government and / or the Secretary of State for scotland on entering into an agreement with him to provide dwellings for letting.Expenditure by the new town development corporations and by the scottish special Housing Association is financed directly from the Exchequer.80. Housebuilding by local authorities consists mainly of provision of house for families displaced by sum clearance operations, the provisionof houses for .the elderly and building for overspill schemes. As a resultof slum clearance action in 1961 over 75,000 houses were closed or demolishedin England and Wales and in Scotland, but about three-quarters of a millionknown slum dwellings still remain. These are not evenly distributed anda special drive has been begun to clear the worst of them, particularly inthe older cities in the North. To cover this and also permit of an attackon other forms of squalor, plans have been made to raise the level of buildingby public authorities in England and Wales and Scotland over the next fewyears to about 145,000 dwellings a year. The figures of investment expendi-ture given above for 1962/63 and 1963/64 allow for this. A major partof the increase in the figure now shown for 1962/63 over the corresponding figure in last year&apos;s White Paper (Cmnd. 1522) is due, however, to highercosts of public authority house building. In Scotland, the indications are thatthe low level of public sector building in 1961/62 will be followed by arise in 1962/63 and 1963/64 as local authorities make better progress with
redevelopment and more houses are completed in the new towns and other areas which are to receive overspill population from Glasgow. The &quot;figurestaf expenditure shown above allow for an increase in starts from under&apos;20,000 in 1961/62 to 24,000 in 1962/63 and 1963/64.81. The decision taken in 1961 to hold back temporarily the numberof dwellings started in England and Wales was described in Cmnd. 1522.The purpose of this action was to ease the pressure on the building industryand to permit dwellings under construction to be completed more rapidly.Subsequently there have been signs of some improvement in the rate of completion, and the trend of starts is now rising. In Scotland there wasno similar restriction of houses started but in 1961/62 public authoritiesstarted and completed fewer houses than forecast; the level of investment expenditure remained about the same as in the previous year because theaverage cost of a house was higher.Water and Sewerage  million	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63	1963/64England and Wales				Water	32-3&apos;	32-9	34-1	35-9Sewerage    ...              .........	37-9	46-2	54-4	57-0Total   ...	70-2	79-1	88-5	92-scotland				Water       ...     ...     ...     ......	5-9	4-8	5-6	6-9Sewerage    .........	2-8	3-7	4-8	5-6Total   ...      .........	8-7	8-5	10-4	12-582. The table shows capital expenditure by local water boards and authorities and local sewerage authorities, and capital expenditure on water and sewerage by new town development corporations ; expenditure by privatewater companies is not included.83. For the most part expenditure is financed by loans, for which localboards and authorities require loan sanction from the Minister of housing and Local Government or the Secretary of State for Scotland, unless borrowing powers have been obtained by Act of Parliament. To assist certain schemes in rural areas and development districts grants are paid by the Minister of housing and Local Government and by the Secretary of State for Scotland,under the Rural Water Supplies and Sewerage Acts and the Local Employ-ment Act, 1960 (Class V, Votes 1 and 9).84. The figures for expenditure in England and Wales on water schemes in 1961/62 and in 1962/63 are rather lower than those given in October,1961 (Cmnd. 1522). These changes are the result partly of the deferment bywater undertakers of schemes not immediately necessary and partly of theregrouping of water undertakings. This regrouping, which has involvedmuch of the water industry, has caused new undertakings to review their investment plans and its effect upon the actual level of expenditure in1961/62 and 1962/63 has been rather greater than foreseen. expenditure is expected to rise in 1963/64, as work is begun on postponed schemes.85. The slightly higher figure for expenditure on sewerage in Englandand Wales in 1962/63 follows the extension of the powers of river boardsunder the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act, 1961.   The higher standard
of effluent required by the boards will entail some increase in capital expendi-ture by a number of local authorities on their sewage disposal works.86. The largest water schemes in England and Wales for which provision is made in 1962/63 and 1963/64 are those shown in paragraph 94 of Cmnd.1522, with the exception of the Coquet scheme for Tyneside, which shouldbe completed in 1962/63. In addition provision has been made in these years for the construction of Diddington Reservoir for the Great Ouse WaterAuthority ; the Derwent Reservoir for the Sunderland and South ShieldsWater Company and the Durham County Water Board ; the further develop-ment of existing sources by the best Wiltshire Water Board: the Stithiansscheme for an impounding reservoir for Kerrier Rural District Council;an inltiake and treatment wOnkis for the abstriaotion of waiter from the RiverTeslt by Southampton County Borough; and, from 1963-64, the con-reconstruotion of the Whlarife syphon and Howstean Catchwater schemes forBradford County Borough and a reservoir far Oxford County Borough.87. Provision has again been made for the sewerage and sewage disposalschemes in England and Wales shown in paragraph 95 of Cmnd. 1522.The largest schemes on which expenditure has been approved are for fouland surface water sewerage at Exeter, flood relief at Ipswich, a new sewage disposal Works at Burton-on-Trenlt and the reconstruction and extensionof the North Sewage Disposal Works alt Liverpool. These schemes areexpected to start in 1962-63 and continue in 1963-64.88. The estimate of expenditure in Scotland in 1962-63 is considerably higher than that given in October, 1961 (Cmnd. 1522) and this rise isexpected to continue into the following year. The increased expenditure is mainly on schemes deferred in 1961-62 and on a number of new major projects on which important industrial developments depend. Large waterschemes for which provision is made include regional schemes in the counties of Angus and Kincardine, Perth and Clackmannan, Dumfriesshire,Lanarkshire and West Lothian. In particular, provision is made for ascheme to tap Loch Lomond, expected to start in 1963-64, as a majorisource of water supply to serve the industrial belt in Central Scotland.Sewerage and sewage disposal schemes for which provision is made includethe modernisation of works at Glasgow and Falkirk, comprehensive schemesat Granigemiouth and Kirkinitiilooh, and new works primarily to serveindustrial developmenits in West Lothian and Renfrewshire.Local Authority Health and Welfare Services          million	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63	1963/64England and Wales				Health:				Mental health services ...   -......	1-7	31	3-6	7-0Ambulance  service,   clinics,   health				centres, etc.............	3-7	4-2	3-6.	5-0Welfare:				Old people&apos;s homes, etc.        ......	7-4	9-5	10-8	110Total   ......	12-8	16-8	19-0	23-scotland				Health       ......      .........	0-3	0-2	0-4	0-5Welfare      ...............	0-3	0-3	0-3	0-3Total   ............	0-6	0-5	0-7	0-8
89. These  programmes  are the responsibility  of local authorities.Expenditure is financed mainly from borrowing within allocations aominis- ,tered by the Ministry of Health or the Scottish Home and Healtih Depart-ment, but also from authorities&apos;revenue.90. The rapidly rising level of investment in the local health and welfare services reflects &apos;bhe policy that those in need of help should wherever possible receive it in the community and should become hospital in-patientsonly if the treatment or caTe required is such as only a hospital can provide. All the local health and welfare authorities in England and Waleswere asked early in 1962 to prepare long-term plans for the developmentof their services on this footing. These plans will provide for, amongsteither things, the expansion and improvement of residentiaT accommodation for the elderly (whose numbers continue to rise) anld of training centres and residential accommodation for the mentally disordered.91. In Scotland local authorities are not responsible as in Englandand Wales for the ambulance service or, to the same extent, for trainingcentres for mentally handicapped children. The higher figures of expendi-ture for 1962^63 and 1963-64 follow the expansion of the mental heaWhservices to provide training centres for the mentally disordered, hostelsand similar facilities in the community. These services have developedlater in Scotland than in England and Wales, where legislation was enactedearlier.Hospital Services  million	1960/61	1961/62	1962/63	1963/64England and Wales Hospitals: Major projects   .........

Subject in all cases to the direction of the Minister of Health andof the Secretary of State for Scotland, capital expenditure on hospitals isthe responsibility of Regional Hospital Boards, except for teaching hospitals
in England and Wales, where the Board of Governors are responsible.Expenditure included in the table above is financed wholly from theExchequer, through the National Health Service Votes (Class VI, Votes 14,16 and 18).93. During 1961, hospital authorities in England and Wales were askedto draw up plans for capital development in terms of the work they wishedto see started by 1971. From these proposals a programme of hospital building, which is to be reviewed and carried forward annually, was com-piled and presented to Parliament in January, 1962 in the form of a comprehensive plan for the hospital service in England and Wales. this plan is described in A Hospital Plan for England and Wales (Cmnd. 1604).lit selts out a programme for the building and improvement of large numbersof hospitals in the decade ending in 1970/71 including several major projects ; it also presenlts a new concept of the pattern of the hospital services centred on the district general hospital and complemented bythe expected development of the services for the prevention of illness andfor care in the community.94. The programme rests on broad assumptions about the availability of capital funds. For the first five years of the decade 1961-62 -1970-71expenditure of  200 million has been assumed, and for the next fiveyears expenditure of  300 million. The total value of schemes planned to start before 1971 has been estimated at over  700 million. These sumsare molt commifcmenlts, however, and the rate of implementation ,of theprogramme will be reviewed annually.95. Hospital authorities in Scotland also were invited to make proposalsfor the major hospital projects which they considered should be under-taken. A comprehensive plan based on these proposals, for the develop-ment of the hospital services in Scotland, for the decade ending 1970-71was set out in the Hospital Plan for Scotland (Cmnd. 1602) presented toParliament in January, 1962. The hospital service will have as its focalpoint the main teaching hospitals in the cities, all of which are to be replacedor improved. The new district general hospitals in other main populationcentres will replace a variety .of separate units. For planning purposescapital expenditure of  70 million over the ten year period has been assumed.It is intended that in Scotland too a continuous ten-year plan should bekept in being.96. Details of the major building schemes now in progress are givenin Appendix TV to the National Health Service Votes in the 1962/63Estimates. A comprehensive list of work completed and in progress is published by the Ministry of Health and the Scottish Health and home department in a series of biannual progress reports.

Almost all this expenditure is financed from the appropriatedepartmental votes.98. Investment in agriculture and fishing is administered by the Ministryof Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of Agriculture andFisheries for Scotland (Class V, Votes 2, 7, 9 and 10). It includes investment by the Ministry in smallholdings, experimental husbandry farms and horticulture-culture stations and fishery research, and by the Agricultural Land Corn-mission and the Land Settlement Association on the Ministry&apos;s behalf;investment by the Department in smallholdings, research institutes, agricul-tural colleges, and fishery research and protection vessels ; investment by the herring Industry Board ; and the purchase by the Department of vessels forcharter for Highlands and Islands shipping services.99. Investment expenditure by the Forestry Commission is mainly on theconstruction of forest roads and the replacement of obsolete vehicles(Class V, Vote 11).100. Expenditure on Government buildings, including the provision of office furniture, is borne on the Votes of the Ministry of Public Building and works (Class IX, Votes 2, 4, 5 and 6). The largest of the current projectsare set out in the Appendices to these Votes in the 1962-63 Estimates and include the reconstruction of Nos. 10, 11 and 12 Downing Street and the old.Treasury Building in Whitehall, the construction of the new road research laboratory at Crowthorne for the Department of Industrial and scientific research and the acquisition of the Bridge Street Parliament Street site for development.101. Factory building comprises expenditure by the Board of Trade(Class IV, Vote 3) on land and buildings under the Local Employment Act,1960. The factories are built mainly to toe leased or sold on amortisationterms to manufacturers who intend to start production in development districts.   The factory space completed in 1960/61 amounted to 2 million
square feet; in 1961/62 the total was 3 million square feet it is expectedthat about a further 3 million square feet will be completed in 19,62/63 and1J-2 million square feet in 1963/64. The figures of investment expenditureallow for a further programme of advance factory building.102. Expenditure on civil aerodromes and air navigation services is administered by the Ministry of Aviation (Class IV, Vote 9). Spendingat civil aerodromes is mainly on increasing the amount of traffic that canbe handled in accordance with modern commercial air transport techniques and on expanding revenue-producing facilities. The main projects are, atLondon (Heathrow) Airport, on the long-haul terminal building, the exten-sion of freight handling and apron capacity, a multi-storey car park and theintroduction of a pier system serving aircraft stands ; at London (Gatwick)Airport, on the beginning of extensions to the terminal building and aprons ;and, at Prestwick, the construction of a new terminal building, aprons andtaxiways.103. There will continue to be substantial expenditure on the extensionof Air Traffic Control systems.104. The Ministry of Aviation&apos;s investment in civil research and develop-ment forms part of the expenditure on capital facilities for aeronautical research carried out in the Ministry&apos;s establishments (Class IV, Vote 7).The aim of this research programme is to provide a sound background of scientific knowledge for progress in aeronautics. The programme includeswork on improving safety, reliability and economy in the operation of aircraft, on problems associated with high speed flight and on the exploitation of new techniques, such as vertical take-off.105. Expenditure on harbours by the Ministry of Transport (Class IV,Vote 13) covers the provision of emergency facilities at various ports and capital expenditure at Faslane Port in Scotland.106. Expenditure on oil storage and distribution is by the Ministry of power (Class IV, Vote 15) for the provision of emergency facilities.107. Expenditure on civil defence is by the Home Office and the scottish home and Health Department (Class III, Votes 3 and 4). The figures shown above are higher than those given October, 1961 (Cmnd. 1522) becausethey now include the central purchase of civil defence and auxiliary fire service vehicles and of radiac and communication equipment for reservestocks and training purposes.108. Expenditure on prisons is financed from the Prison Commission and scottish Home and Health Department Prison Votes (Class III, Votes7 and 8).The building programme initiated in 1959 at present provides for aboutforty new establishments in England and Wales and five in Scotland. Theseare needed to relieve overcrowding and to provide facilities for observationof unsentenced prisoners and for new methods of treatment. About one-half of the proposed new establishments have been completed and broughtinto use, including England and Wales, a new psychiatric prison and thefirst of a system of remand centres, and in Scotland, a new detentioncentre and remand centres. The number of detention centres for young;offenders has been increased from four to twelve in England and Wales and;
in Scotland, where the first centre was opened in 1960, another is expected^to be in use early in 1963. Both in England and Wales and in Scotlandprovision is made for new and improved staff quarters.109. The remaining capital expenditure by the Home Office and theScottish Home and Health Department includes police colleges and trainingcentres, the provision of wireless equipment for the police and fire services,and licensed and ancillary premises in the State Management Districts.110. Expenditure by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research(Class VII, Vote 4) is on capital equipment for the departments ownestablishments and on capital grants to universities and others. Expenditureion buildings for the departments own use is borne on the Votes of theMinistry of Public Building and Works (see paragraph 100).111. Expenditure by the Stationery Office (Class IX, Vote 9) is mainly on office machinery, including automatic data processing equipment, for thegovernment service.112. The grant-aided bodies whose investment is shown in the Tablecomprise the Medical Research Council, the Agricultural Research Council,the Nature Conservancy and the British Council. Investment by certain other grant-aided bodies is included under other headings.Other Investment by Local Authorities  million	1960/61		1961/62	1962/63	1963/64	Great Britain						Road passenger transport.........	4	2	6-6	5-8	5	8Car parks.........	2	0	2-2	10-2	11	1Municipal aerodromes     .........	1	6	2-5	2-7	2	3Docks and harbours       ...      ......	9	3	9-3	12-9	13	5England and Wales						Unclassified roads and road lighting	13	0	15-0	15-0	11	0Police and fire services    .........	7	9	9-0	11-3	12	expenditure on Town and Country Plan-					19	ning Acts...............	10	8	15-9	16-6		5Agriculture, fishing, arterial drainage and sea defence       ...      ;.....      ...							8	9	12:5	14-9	14	civil defence        ............	0	5	0-8	1-2	1	new Towns...............	4	7	8-5	6-4	9	1General Services    ............	42	3	500	54-6	58	scotland						Unclassified roads and road lighting	3	3	3-0	3-1	3	0Police and fire services     .........	1	1	1-3	1-2	1	expenditure on Town and Country Plan-					1	1ning Acts...............	0	5	1-1	1-1		Civil defence        ............	0	1	0-2	0-2	0	 new Towns......      ......	1	5	1-1	2-0	2	1General Services    .........      ...	3	5	3-4	5-2	5	9Total......	115	2	142-4	164-4	172-3	113. For the most part this expenditure is financed from local authorities&apos;internal resources or by borrowing ; some items attract specific government grants.
114. Expenditure on road passenger transport is mainly upon the(purchase of vehicles for local authority bus fleets but also upon the con-struction of garages, bus stations and shelters.115. The figures for expenditure on car parks show a big expansion oflocal authority activity in this field; partly taking the form of comprehensiveschemes to control street parking, usually employing parking meters. MoreJthan one-half of expenditure in 1962/63 will be on a fairly small number ofmulti-storey and underground car parks. Nearly one-half of all expenditure is in the London Traffic Area.116. Investment in docks and harbours is carried out by port, dock and harbour authorities. These are mainly independent statutory public trustsbut some are under the control of local councils. Expenditure is financed from internal sources or by borrowing. Similar expenditure by the british transport Commission is included in the table on page . The RochdaleCommittee on Ports in its Report (Cmnd. 1824) has recommended a higher level of investment in ports and a National Port Authority which wouldsupervise all major capital investment in ports. The Government are con-sidering the Report.117. About one-half of the expenditure on municipal aerodromes in1962/63 will be for the extension of terminal buildings, runways, apronsand car parks at Manchester and Birmingham. The rest of the investment is spread over seventeen municipal aerodromes.118. Expenditure on unclassified roads and road lighting is additional to the expenditure upon roads shown on page . It includes expenditureon trunk road lighting, which is shared equally by the Minister of transport and local lighting authorities.119. Expenditure on police and fire services continues to increase. Themain needs are the modernisation of existing stations and the provisionof new stations to match movements of population and to replace stationsdemolished in connection with comprehensive urban development schemes.120. Expenditure under the Town and Country Planning Acts is chieflyupon the redevelopment by local authorities of war damaged and blightedareas, and upon town expansion schemes under the Town development act, 1952. Expenditure in 1961/62 was less that forecast in October, 1961i(Cmnd. 1522), but it is expected to grow in 1962/63 and 1963/64 following the large number of redevelopment schemes now in preparation. over three-quarters of total expenditure is on the acquisition of land and build-ings for redevelopment and town expansion. Most of the remainder ison preliminary development, that is, the provision of roads and sewers,and on other forms of development, including factories, chiefly for thepurposes of the Local Employment Act, 1960, the Town development act, 1952, and the Housing and Town Development (Scotland) Act, 1957.121. About one-half of the expenditure under the head of agriculture,fishing, arterial drainage and sea defence is upon arterial drainage and about one-quarter upon slaughterhouses, mainly in consequence of theSlaughterhouses Act, 1958. Other expenditure is on smallholdings, ruralroads and cattle markets.
122. Expenditure on civil defence is almost wholly incurred orrtheprovision of training premises and operational controls. Both forms of spending are expected to increase during 1963/64, the larger proportionbeing spent on training premises. In Scotland a seven-year programme was started in 1961/62 under which it is hoped to set up Group and area control centres where these do- not already exist. Local authoritiesare being encouraged to find buildings that can be adapted for this pur-pose. If suitably located, these buildings will also he used as trainingcentres.123. The expenditure on new towns shown here is toy the new town development corporations and the Commission for the New Towns onthe building of factories, offices, and shops ; expenditure on housing and sewerage in new towns is included in the main programmes under theseheadings. These towns are playing an important part in relieving the con-gcstion in London and elsewhere and the various forms of developmenthave to be organised as a unified operation and kept in proper relationto each other. The figures given for. 1962/63 and 1963/64 include expenditure in the twelve new towns already well established, and, inaddition, make provision for the first two years&apos; work on the new townsrecently designated at Livingston and Skelmersdale. The figures for1963/64 also allow for a possible beginning of work at Dawley. Expendi-ture by development corporations is financed by borrowing from theExchequer under the New Towns Act, 1946, and expenditure toy the Com-rnission for the New Towns is similarly financed under the New TownsAct, 1959.124. General services include capital expenditure on approved schools and remand homes. For many years capital expenditure was not enoughto provide much needed improvements in standards of accommodation.More recently the quantity of the accommodation, as well as the quality,has become inadequate in face of the increasing numbers committed bythe courts and an enlarged building programme was launched in 1960.It is designed to provide additional accommodation, to replace old build-ings or bring them up to modern standards and to improve facilities fortraining. The programme has since been further expanded to provide alarger number of new schools. Expenditure on children&apos;s homes is mainlydevoted to the provision of family group homes and small homes to replace the older and larger institutional type.125. General services also include coast protection works and the pro-vision of town halls and offices, libraries and museums, swimming bathsand recreation grounds, cemeteries and crematoria, court buildings, markets,and vehicles and equipment for refuse collection and street cleaning:the figures for Scotland include also expenditure upon slaughterhouses,river purification and flood prevention schemes. Local authorities were asked to restrain the growth of expenditure on these services in July,1961, but it has recently been possible to allow some relaxation in this field. This relaxation, and the continuing desire of local authorities to expand, improve and modernise many of these services (and particularly with the likelihood that more will be done to provide for sport and physical recreation) suggest that the level of capital investment will againtend to rise in 1963/64.
&apos; APPENDIXNotes on definition1. This White Paper is concerned with the gross fixed capital formation ofthe civil public sector in Great Britain. Except that sales of land and fixed assets are not deducted, the definition of gross fixed capital formation is the sameas that used in the Blue Book National Income and Expenditure, as explained in National Income Statistics: Sources and Methods, published by H.M.Stationery Office. It comprises expenditure on replacement of, and additions and major improvements to, fixed capital assets located in. Great Britain. Fixed assetsare land, buildings, civil engineering works (e.g. roads, reservoirs, drainage works,etc.), vehicles, ships and aircraft plant and machinery. The word &quot; fixed &quot; denotesthe exclusion of changes in stocks (if any), and &quot; gross&quot; that no allowance ismade for depreciation. Ships and aircraft, wherever based, are included if owned by public authorities in Great Britain.2. In coverage this White Paper differs in certain respects from the Blue Book.Northern Ireland and the iron and siteel companies still in public ownership are excluded and certain capital formation by private bodies financed from public funds is included. In the Blue Book the figures for the public sector includeNorthern Ireland and the iron and steel companies still in public ownership butexclude private capital formation financed from public funds.3. In this White Paper local authorities have been defined as all bodies coveredby the provisions of Part XI of the Local Government Act, 1933, and Part XIIIof the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1947, plus the Scottish Special housing association and the new town development corporations, which are defined as public corporations in National Income Statistics : Sources and Methods. the atomic Energy Authority and the Post Office are treated as public corporations in this White Paper, whereas the Blue Book classifies the Atomic energy authority under central Government, and the Post Office as Central government until March, 1961 and a public corporation thereafter.4. Most of the figures for expenditure on the individual programmes are forthe accounting years of the authorities concerned. The South of scotland electricity Board and the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board work to acalendar year; and the accounting year of the National Coal Board ends on theSaturday nearest to 31st December but the figures given in this White Paper are for financial years (1st April-31st March). The British Transport Commissionalso works to a calendar year, and in this case the figures have not been adjusted to a financial year basis.5.
