THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  October 1962 &apos;C (62)164 Copy No.  5126th October, 1962CABINETVIENNA CONVENTION ON DIPLOMATIC relations note by the Secretary of the CabinetOn 29th May the Cabinet considered memoranda (C. (62) 65 and 76) bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Selwyn Lloyd, and the Foreign Secretaryabout a proposal by the former that, in ratifying the Vienna Convention onDiplomatic Relations, we should make reservations indicating our unwillingnessto bring our domestic law into line with the provisions of the Convention inrespect of (i) tax exemption for private servants of members of a diplomatic mission, and (ii) exemption from customs duty for goods originating in thiscountry which are re-imported by persons enjoying diplomatic privilege. In the cabinet&apos;s discussion doubts were expressed on the one hand about the proprietyof seeking to contract out unilaterally from particular provisions of a convention which was designed to have the character of international law and, on the other,about the expediency of attempting by fresh legislation to bring the whole ofour domestic law on diplomatic privilege and immunities into line with thisConvention. I was instructed by the Cabinet to arrange for a report to beprepared by officials on the nature of the legislation required for this purpose.This report is annexed. In its final section it deals also with the question ofreservations on the revenue and customs points.2.   The main points in the report may be summarised as follows:(a) The Vienna Convention is a law-making treaty and was intended to havethe characteristics and effect which flow from its status as &quot; internationallegislation &quot;.(b) The United Kingdom is not, as a matter of law, precluded from enteringa reservation at the stage of ratification, but any unilateral reservationwould detract from the legislative effect of the Convention and prejudice the prospect of the rules formulated in it becoming universally accepted as representing international law.(c) The Convention could be ratified without legislation, whether with or without reservations. But if there were no legislation it would notbe possible to obtain the benefit of those provisions of the convention which would reduce the number of persons who at present standoutside the law of this country or the extent of the immunity whichthey enjoy.- (d) The legislation would take the form of a Bill with, probably, four or fiveoperative clauses and a Schedule. (There would be no technicaldifficulty about embodying reservations, if it were decided that theyshould be made, on the two points in the Convention which havealready been brought to the notice of Ministers, namely tax exemption for diplomats&apos; servants and exemption from charges on re-imported goods.)
Cabinet Office, S.WA,26th October, 1962.(e) Little revenue is at stake in tax exemption for diplomats&apos; servants butthe exemption is objectionable in revenue principle and there is no obvious need for it.(/) To concede free entry of goods re-imported might not in itself be verycostly. What the Board of Customs and Excise fear is that the concession, which would in any case be objectionable in principle,might undermine the position of excise duties as such and lead to muchmore serious extensions of privilege.3.   The questions for decision by the Cabinet are:(i) Are we prepared to obtain the advantages of the Convention by enactingin due course legislation, on the lines indicated in paragraph 10 (a) ofthe annexed report, to bring our domestic law into line with theConvention?(ii) Should reservations be made initially on ratification of the convention and subsequently in the legislation on either or both of the two points in respect of which objection was raised by the then Chancellor of theExchequer in May last?(Signed)     NORMAN BROOK.
SECRET3AnnexVIENNA CONVENTION ON DIPLOMATIC RELATIONSReport by OfficialsThis report is arranged under the following heads:I. Status of the Vienna ConventionII. Content of the ConventionIII. Form of legislation requiredIV.-Possible reservations.I. Status of the Vienna Convention2. The Convention is the outcome of the work of the International law commission set up under the Charter of the United Nations to make recommendations for the purpose of encouraging the progressive development ofinternational law and its codification. The leading authorities on internationallaw draw a distinction between treaties creating or declaring international law,sometimes called &quot; international legislation &quot;, and other treaties. The former mayeither codify existing international law or create new law, but have the commoncharacteristic that they represent the concerted view of a large number of states as to what the rules of international law in a particular field are or (as betweenthe parties to the treaty) are to be. They are, in the words of Lord McNair (law of Treaties, 1961, p. 752) &quot;centuries and miles removed from the treaty of peace or of alliance or the treaty of commerce bargaining for reciprocal but differentadvantages &quot;. A particularly important feature of such a &quot; law-making &quot; treaty is that it may, if it purports to have codified rules of customary international law,come to be universally acknowledged as having done so, and thus acquire the status of general rules of law binding not only on parties to the treaty but also on allother States; similarly, if the treaty was intended to develop new rules ofinternational law among the parties to it, those rules, if they prove their worth inpractice and are appropriate for universal application, may come to be accepted as a source of the international customary law to which all States are expectedto conform.3. Whilst it may be difficult to say precisely to what extent the ViennaConvention has codified existing international law and to what extent it has&quot; developed &quot; it, there is no doubt that the Convention is a law-making treaty andwas intended to have the characteristics and effect which flow from its status as&quot; international legislation&quot;. It follows that any derogation from the general application of its provisions by a unilateral reservation would detract from itslegislative effect and prejudice the prospect of the rules formulated in the Conventionbecoming universally accepted as representing international law.II. Content of the Convention4. The Convention is a short and workmanlike document. Within thecompass of twenty pages it gives a comprehensive statement of the rules which areto regulate diplomatic intercourse between the States who are parties to it, and the privileges and immunities which are to be enjoyed by the diplomatic agentsemployed for that purpose. The Articles of the Convention dealing with the lattersubject (Articles 22 to 40) occupy only six of the twenty pages and it is these alonewhich involve any question of legislation.5. Generally speaking, the provisions of the Convention dealing withprivileges and immunities either correspond pretty closely with the law and practice which obtains at present in the United Kingdom, or fill in gaps at particular pointswhere that law is not clearly ascertained, In so far as the Convention differs fromthe domestic law on these subjects, the former is in general less generous than thelatter. The most significant of these differences is as follows. Under the commonSECRET1540 A 2
law and the Diplomatic Privileges Act, 1708, the immunity of a diplomatic envoyfrom suit and legal process extends to all persons employed in the embassy, \yhetherin an official capacity or in a domestic capacity. The Act of 1708 refers specifically to &quot; domesticks &quot;, but the privilege extends at common law to all members of the ambassador^ suite and of his household.. The convention, on the other hand,distinguishes between members of the diplomatic staff, members of theadministrative and technical staff and members of the service (that is domestic service) staff; and under Articles 37.and 38 lower scales of immunities and privilegesare conferred on persons within the second and third of these classes.6. Another important distinction of the same kind is to be found in thetreatment accorded by the Convention to diplomatic agents who are nationals of or permanent residents in the receiving State. Under the Diplomatic ImmunitiesRestriction Act, 1955, section 2, a citizen of the United Kingdom and Coloniesis denied diplomatic immunity in respect of acts performed outside his officialduties and accordingly does not escape civil or criminal liability for anything done,for example, when driving his private car for his own domestic purposes. UnderArticle 38 of the Convention, members of the administrative and technical staff and of the service staff receive no immunities or privileges at all if they are nationals of or permanently resident in the receiving State, and diplomatic agents who are such nationals or residents are entitled only to immunity in respect of official acts unless in either case the receiving State chooses to grant more. The Conventionthus goes beyond the Act of 1955 both in withdrawing immunities and privilegesfrom persons who are permanently resident in the receiving State (as well asnationals of the receiving State) and in withdrawing all immunities and privilegesfrom staff within the lower ranks who are nationals of the receiving State.7. On the other side of the coin the Convention does to some degree extend the fiscal privileges (as opposed to immunities) which are enjoyed under thepresent law and practice. The main instances of this appear in Articles 36 and37, and these are of course the provisions to which the Revenue Departmentstake exception. In particular, except in the case of the private servants of thehead of the Mission, there is no present exemption from taxation in respect ofthe wages of private servants employed by diplomats. However, even in the field of fiscal privileges, the Convention is in several respects less generous than theexisting law, so that, for example, under Article 34 (d) the head of a Mission wouldnot be entitled to the exemption from income tax in respect of interest on BritishGovernment securities which he at present enjoys under section 119(3) of theIncome Tax Act, 1952.8. The Convention creates one further distinction as compared with theexisting law of England, which should be mentioned at this point although assuch it neither reduces nor increases the scope of existing immunities. Underthe law of England, the inviolability of the person and premises of a diplomaticenvoy depends in the long run upon the fact that he is not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts. The Convention, on the other hand, treats inviolability of person and premises as a subject distinct from immunity from suit and legal process:and those provisions of the Convention (already noted) which reduce the scopeof the immunity from suit and legal process do not operate in the same way uponinviolability. The result is (and this would be new as far as our law is concerned,considerations of waiver apart) that under the Convention a diplomatic agentmay be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts but may nevertheless be immune from arrest or execution. This situation is acceptable from the legal point of view.9. The above observations are directed to the position of diplomatic envoysin the ordinary sense. But the Convention also covers the position of high commissioners representing Commonwealth countries in the United Kingdom(Article 14.1(a)). As matters stand, these officers are not protected by thecommon law, but they are entitled under the Diplomatic Immunities(Commonwealth Countries and Republic of Ireland) Act, 1952^. to the sameimmunities (including inviolability) as an ambassador, and most of what has been said above applies equally to them. If is worth adding, however, that in this case the Convention would effect a further reduction of privilege. Under theAct of 1952, a member of the official or domestic staff of a Commonwealth HighCommissioner is excluded from immunity (except in respect of official acts) ifhe is a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies and is not a citizen of that commonwealth country-in other words the exclusion does not apply in casesSECRET&quot;
SECRET-5-of dual nationality. Under the Convention, dual nationality is immaterial. the relevant exceptions from immunity and privilege operate on all nationals of the receiving State whether or not they are also nationals of the sending State.III.-Form of Legislation Required10. The first question is whether any legislation is actually needed at all.Internationally speaking, it is arguable that the United Kingdom could safelyratify the Convention without legislation. There would be no breach of theinternational obligation unless and until immunity or privilege was denied in aparticular case where the Convention requires it to be granted. In so far as theimmunities required by the Convention do not exceed those conceded by theexisting law, and those few additional privileges which are required by theConvention could be granted by administrative action, that situation might be suffiently improbable to ignore it from the international point of view. Onthe other hand, in so far as the immunities conceded by the law of England exceed those provided for by the Convention, it is reasonably clear that the ratification of the Convention, standing alone, would do nothing to amend the existing law.Legislation is accordingly necessary in order to secure the benefit of those provisionsof the Convention which would reduce the number of persons who stand outsidethe reach of the law of this country or the extent of the immunity which theyenjoy. On that assumption, the Bill might in theory take any one of the following three forms:(a) to set out in a Schedule either the whole of the Convention or those partsof the Convention which are relevant to privileges and immunities,and enact (in either case) that those provisions are to have the forceof law in substitution for any rule of law or enactment regulating the privileges and immunities of the classes of persons covered by theConvention;(b) to codify the law of the United Kingdom as amended by the Convention,or in other words to restate in terms of domestic law all the relevant provisions of the Convention;id) to leave the existing common law and statute law standing as the basis ofthe privileges and immunities of diplomatic envoys, High commissioners and their entourage, and enact (whether by way of subtraction oraddition) those specific changes which are called for by the terms ofthe Convention.11. The operative clauses of a Bill on the lines described in paragraph 10(a)above would consist of the clause giving effect to the Convention as set out in theSchedule, and perhaps four or five clauses dealing with incidental matters. Thesematters would no doubt include translations into terms of the law of the UnitedKingdom of certain expressions used in the Convention such as &quot; national of the receiving State &quot; and &quot; Ministry for Foreign Affairs &quot; (Article 39. 1). Provisioncould also be made for the listing by the Secretary of State of the persons entitledto privilege, with or without provision for making his certificate conclusive on that question in any proceedings. The Bill might further specify the persons entitledto waive immunity (Article 32), and would re-enact with the necessary modificationsthe provisions of section 1 of the Diplomatic Immunities Restriction Act, 1955,which enables the Crown to withdraw existing immunities in particular cases byway of retaliation. Finally, the Bill would repeal the Acts of 1708, 1952 and 1955,and make any other necessary consequential repeals or amendments (see forexample Income Tax Act, 1952, section 461 and Diplomatic Immunities(Conferences with Commonwealth Countries and Republic of Ireland) Act, 1961,section 1 (4)).12. There is one difficulty about the drafting of a Bill on the lines justdescribed. At several points the immunities and privileges (or additional immunities and privileges) required by the Convention are those &quot; admitted &quot; (or &quot; granted &quot;)&quot; by the receiving State &quot; (see Article 37.4 and Article 38). It would therefore benecessary either to make it clear that no immunities or privileges (or no additionalimmunities or privileges) are granted as a matter of law, or to state in the Billwhat they are to be, or perhaps-and this is one of the outstanding questions ofpolicy still to be considered-to take power to define them by Order in council under the Bill. Subject to that point, it seems clear that a Bill on these lines would
be preferable to either of the other alternatives. The Schedule itself would not besusceptible to amendments; the operative clauses would be short and (apart fromthe question of additional immunities) uncontroversial; and the Bill would clearlygive full effect to the international obligations imposed by the Convention.13. A Bill on the lines described at paragraph 10 (b) above would be bothmore difficult to construct and more difficult to pass. The operative clauses wouldbe considerably longer, and would be open to amendment at all points. Apartfrom the fact that the end-product would consist of a re-statement of the convention in terms appropriate exclusively to the law of the United Kingdom, this courseappears to have ho advantage as compared with the first.14. A Bill in the form described at paragraph 10 (c) above is theoreticallypossible, but on the face of it it would be extremely difficult to construct such aBill. If it were possible, the Bill would be open to much the same objections asthe Bill described in paragraph (b), while the end-product would be highly confusing.It seems therefore that alternative (a) is likely to prove the effective choice whenit comes to drafting a Bill.IV.-Possible Reservations15. There are two points on which it has been suggested that reservationsshould be made when the Convention is ratified on behalf of the United Kingdom:(a) Tax exemption for diplomats&apos; servants (the income tax point); and(b) Exemption from charges on the re-import of goods originally exportedwithout payment of excise duty (the excise point).(a) The income tax point16. Article 37.4 of the Convention provides that private servants of membersof a Mission, who are not nationals of or permanently resident in the receivingState, shall be exempt from taxes on their emoluments. At present only the servants of Heads of Missions enjoy such an exemption in this country. The proposed extension to servants of all members of a Mission was unsuccessfully opposed bythe United Kingdom in the negotiations in Vienna. The question for decision is whether, on ratifying the Convention, the United Kingdom should make a reservation in regard to Article 37.4.17. The Chancellor of the Exchequer (then Mr. Selwyn Lloyd), in C. (62) 65,opposed the proposed exemption on the grounds that there is no obvious reason why private servants of members of a Mission, paid not by the foreign government but by those members, should enjoy exemption from income tax; that in thesecircumstances there are no clear grounds on which the necessary legislation couldbe justified to Parliament and that further enlargement of tax privileges in the diplomatic field would be viewed unfavourably both in Parliament and in thecountry generally. (A similar exemption is proposed in the international ConsularConvention which has now been drafted by the International Law Commission.)18. The Foreign Secretary on the other hand, in C. (62) 76, supported theproposed exemption, primarily on the ground that having signed the convention the United Kingdom ought not to seek to avoid the parts it dislikes by making a reservation on ratification. The United Kingdom view, which it had long actedon, was that reservations to international agreements should not be made unlessvital national interests were at stake. The present issue, however, was a smallmatter. It is common ground that the amount of revenue at stake must be smalland that the liability to tax is not easily enforced (as diplomatic employers cannotbe compelled at law to give the necessary data).(b) The excise point19. Diplomats stationed in this country have from time immemorial been allowed to import goods free of customs duty. But the practice has never been extended to give relief from excise duties on goods originating in this country (e.g.,the excise duty on spirits); and the law (section 35 of the Customs and Excise Act,1952) provides generally that goods liable to excise duty (e.g., Scotch whisky) cannotescape it by being exported duty free from bond and then re-imported. Thissection imposes on such goods a charge equal to the amount of the excise duty
in force at the time of importation. The law provides no concession for diplomats- -and no concession has in practice ever been accorded to diplomats or anyone else.-20. The effect of Article 36.1 of the Convention, if accepted unreservedly,would be to enable the privileged diplomat to import from overseas goods(regardless of their origin) for his personal or official use without attracting liability for payment of duties or taxes of any kind. A direct change in present practice which would be necessitated by acceptance of the Article would be that the fiscalcharge on re-importation of excisable goods exported duty free would have to bewaived when such goods were re-imported by diplomats. This change could bemade extra-statutorily-like the customs privilege for diplomats, which isextra-statutory although there is some pressure for these privileges to be writteninto the statute law. There would be no immediate question of giving diplomatsa general exemption from excise duties. But the Customs and Excise department would prefer to adhere to the basic revenue principle that no goods liable to exciseduty should be consumed within the United Kingdom without paying that duty.They, fear that if this principle were breached even in limited fashion it would notbe long before the position of excise duties as such, including purchase tax on goodsproduced and supplied in this country without the formality of exportation, wasundermined. They also believe that in course of time the privilege would have tobe extended to international organisations, Visiting Forces and others outside theordinary diplomatic field. (The draft of the international Consular Conventionfollows the text of the Vienna Convention on the excise point.)21. As in the case of the inoome tax point, the proposed change of practice on the excise point was unsuccessfully opposed by the United Kingdom in thenegotiations in Vienna. The question whether ratification should be made subjectto reservation on one or both points turns on the view taken by Ministers aboutthe balance of revenue considerations on the one hand and considerations ofinternational policy and practice on the other.October 1962.
