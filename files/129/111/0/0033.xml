COPY NO.       0 XCABINETIC.(62) 18316th November,  196GENERAL GRANTS (ENGLAND AND WALES)FOR 1963-64 AND 1964-65Memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local government at their meeting on 8th November the Cabinet invited me toinform them as soon as possible of the outcome of the statutoryconsultation with representatives of local authorities (C. C. (62) 67thConclusions, Minute 4).2.      The arguments which the representatives used were verymuch those which had been foreseen, -but I was surprised by theforce with which they were presented.     Particular exception wastaken to the fact that the reduction in general grants was beingproposed, in effect, because of the expected increase in rate-deficiency grants.     This was widely felt to be, not merely illogical,but a positive breach of faith;   as one speaker put it, the generalgrants were in aid of general expenditure, and not to be raided forother purposes.3.      It was made quite clear that if we persevered with the proposalto reduce the general grants we would bring the whole system into disrepute and play into the hands of the advocates of specific grants,which could not have been cut in this way.     The proposals now being prepared for bringing highway expenditure on everything exceptmajor schemes within the general grants would find little chance of acceptance.4.      Other speakers pointed out that the reduction in general grantswould fall hardest on those areas which did not qualify for rate-deficiency grants, and that these tended to be the areas in whichhouseholders would be hardest hit by revaluation.    I was alsoreminded that it was hardly consistent to send out a circular, as Iam proposing to do, urging local authorities to keep their ratesdown and at the same time to make a cut in the general grants whichwas bound to put them up.5.      I have come to the conclusion in the light of what was paidthat the arguments against reducing the grants are much stronger than I thought when I agreed on a compromise with the chief secretary, Treasury.    I am now convinced that we would be well-advised not to pursue this course.     This is also the view of theMinister of Health, who was present at the meeting, and of the-1-
it-Home Secretary and the Minister of Education, who were represented by junior Ministers.    I made no promises to the local&apos;authority representatives, but I did make it clear that if theGovernment reconsidered their position this would not imply apermanent addition to the aggregate of Exchequer assistance andthat we might seek changes in the rate-deficiency grants system.This they accepted.6.      The Minister of Health has a special reason for sharing my view.     The general grants cover health and welfare expenditure.Local authorities have submitted plans for developing their health and welfare services over the next ten years, and the national planpromised in The Queen&apos;s Speech will be laid before Parliament next spring.    Steady development of these community care services is approved policy:  it is not only essential for social reasons but was assumed by the Hospital Plan which would otherwise have had to beon much more expensive lines.    It would be the worst possibleconjuncture if the presentation of these plans, which ought to bea boost to local government morale and an important politicalasset, were to -coincide with a major row about grant.    Insteadof welcoming the plans many authorities would then be likely torepresent them as yet a further attempt to shift responsibilityfrom taxes to rates.    The will to press ahead would be underminedeven in progressive authorities, and the laggards would seize onthe excuse for inaction.K. J.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S. W. 1.16th November, 1962-2-
