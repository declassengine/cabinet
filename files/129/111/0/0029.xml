C (62) 179 Copy No.  5 113th November, 1962CABINETPOOL BETTING DUTYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer would welcome the advice of my colleagues on a problem that has arisenfrom the decision of the Birmingham City and Aston Villa Football Clubs tosue Customs and Excise for the repayment of Pool Betting Duty paid in respectof football pools conducted between 1954 and 1960. I wish to use the defence that payment was made and accepted under a mutual mistake of law. The LawOiiicers do not agree.2. There is no doubt that the payments were made under a mutual mistakeof law and that the defence would be effective. There is no other defence andthe alternative therefore would be to admit liability, although we have consistently said in the past, both in correspondence and in the House of Commons,that we saw no reason to make repayment.3. The total cost that might be involved if all football clubs in similarsituations then proceeded against us might amount to  7 or  8 million.The Facts of the Case4. The competitions run by these two clubs were typical. The totalnumber of such competitions being run on the same lines was about 300. Eachentrant paid Is. for a card, the cards being issued weekly. 2d. went, to the clubas &quot; voluntary donation &quot;. Tax (3d.) was deducted from the remaining 10d., andafter deduction of working expenses (approximately 2d.) the balance went intothe pool to be divided among the winners after the matches had been played.The numbered cards were at first issued without any freedom of choice. Thepolice warned the clubs that they were conducting illegal lotteries and therebyopen to prosecution. The clubs decided to avoid this danger by changing theirmethods so as to allow the entrants to make a choice of numbers or to pick theirown teams. This amount of selection was enough to avoid prosecution as the degree of choice involved was thought by all concerned to amount to betting. Asa corollary it was assumed both by the clubs and by Customs and Excise thatPool Betting Duty would become payable. The clubs took the initiative inoffering payment which was accepted.5. There were two further developments. In practice very little selectionwas made by the entrants, a great majority of whom continued merely to acceptwhatever numbered card they were given. One club, Stockport, refused payment and the Customs and Excise felt compelled to sue. They lost the case on thegrounds that, contrary to their view and the view of others concerned, bettingwas not in fact involved in the new system, the Judge holding that the verysmall number of cases of selection were de minimis.6. Tax was not collected after the judgment but action was taken in theFinance Act, 1961, to restore the situation and to make tax leviable wherever the rules provided for the exercise of judgment.7. Birmingham City and Aston Villa are now seeking repayment of theduty paid before the Stockport judgment. As I have said the total amount involved if all the clubs were to claim (and if these two succeed they seem likelyto do so) might amount to  7 or  8 million.   After considering the whole caseTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  November 1962
my predecessor refused payment. Faced with the present actions we must eitherplead as our defence that the payments were made under mistake of law, whichis a valid defence for which there are precedents, or pay up.The Arguments for Using the Defence of Mistake of Law8. In my view this is just the kind of case in which the use of this defenceisjully justified. There is no doubt that it is legally valid and the decision whether to use it is therefore one not of law but of policy. I can see no justification forrepaying large sums from the Exchequer in these circumstances, and I believe Ishould be failing in my responsibility to Parliament if I should deliberately eschewa defence which is available to me.9. The Law Officers accept that the defence of mistake of law is valid butargue that is should not be used because consistency of policy requires us not touse it if we are able to repay those who originally bore the burden of the tax, whoare, in their view, the prize winners. I cannot agree with them for the following reasons:(i) The parties to the actions against us are the clubs and everyone agrees that they did not bear the burden of the duty. They received their&quot; voluntary donations &quot; of 2d. a time free of tax.(ii) The burden of the duty is in my view, as a matter of logic, clearly bornenot by the winners but by the entrants as a whole. If it were designed as a duty to be levied on the winners, it would be expressed as a proportion of their winnings. It is in fact expressed as a proportionof the stake money, and it is deductable from the stakes before they are paid into the pool, at a time when all concerned have an equal interestand there are as yet no winners. All entrants acquire for lOd. a share ina pool which will subsequently be divided on the results of matches notyet played. Manifestly the smaller the pool the less value they get fortheir 10d., and they have already before the matches are played sufferedthis loss by bearing the burden of the duty. In other words, the entrantsall acquire equal contingent claims on the pool and the duty was included in the price of the claim.(iii) We have already said that we can see no reason to make repayment insuch cases. We must have foreseen the danger of being sued and ifwe now let the cases go by default it would be quite inconsistent withour previous attitude.(iv) Even if it were possible to identify and trace the prize winners in some cases it could certainly not be done in all the many cases, up to 300, that could then be presented. It would be impossible to identify the entrantsat all. Over the years 1954-60 there were some half million prizewinners and many millions of entries. The sheer mechanics of anyrepayment are therefore immense, if not impossible.(v) There seems to me no moral case for repayment at all.  Those concerneddeliberately adopted a course which in their view, and the view of theCustoms and Excise, made them liable to pool betting duty. They didthis to avoid prosecution for conducting lotteries, and in this aim theywere successful. There is no doubt that it was the intention ofParliament that duty should be payable in such cases, and this was the belief both of the clubs and of the Customs and Excise. Indeed, itwould have been grossly unfair if such competitions had not been included within the scope of the duty.Conclusion10. I conclude that it is not only right but necessary for me to invoke thedefence of mistake of law in these two cases.R. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,12th November, 1962.
