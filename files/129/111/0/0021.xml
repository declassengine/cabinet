C. (62) 171 Copy No.    g \6th November, 1962CABINETGENERAL GRANTS (ENGLAND AND WALES) FOR 1963-64AND 1964-65Memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and paymaster general and the Minister of Housing and Local Government and minister for Welsh AffairsThe general grant, in many ways the most important single decisionGovernment have to take on public expenditure, must be fixed by Order beforethe Christmas Recess. The decision is for 1963-64 and 1964-65. In short itcommits us for the next two Budgets.2. Before the grant proposals are presented to Parliament, statutoryconsultation between the elected representatives of local authorities and Ministersis required. This is due to take place on 15th November. Before that, consultationstake place between local and central Government officials; this process is nowgoing on.3. We wish to report to our colleagues the proposed lines of settlement forthe grant.Expenditure4. The local services which attract general grant are education (by far the biggest), health, fire, child care, and some minor services. We decide first what levelof expenditure on these services should be accepted; and then how much grant should be paid in the light of this expenditure and other relevant circumstances.5. The level of expenditure on all these services is put at  1,033 million in1963-64, and  1,082 million in 1964-65 (details are given in the table attached).This implies a rate of growth in real terms of spending on education (about83 per cent, of the whole) of 5J per cent, between 1962-63 and 1963-64, and5 per cent, between 1963-64 and 1964-65. For next year this is a slightly higher rate than was implied by the decisions on long-term expenditure which we tookin the summer but for the year after is about the same. It allows for an increased number of teachers and places and some improvements in standards resultinglargely from the effect of the educational building programme. These figures havebeen agreed between the Chief Secretary, Treasury, and the Minister of Education.Expenditure on other services is consistent with the rates of growth we accepted in the summer.Grant6. The issue here is the division of the burden between taxpayer andratepayer. This depends on how much the local authorities have to spend on all services (i.e., general grant services and other services as well) and how muchthey receive in grants of all kinds. Beside general grant there are specific grants towards certain services, and rate-deficiency grants which are designed to bringthe poorer authorities&apos; resources up to the national average.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.

7. If the new general grants were fixed on the same basis as heretofore theresult of revaluation and industrial rerating would, paradoxically enough, be tobring about a considerable drop in the proportion of local authority expenditurefinanced by rates. That is because the changes increase the disparity between theresources of the various authorities and this increased disparity calls automaticallyfor a large increase in rate-deficiency grants. The result would be that of anexpected increase of  124 million in net rate fund expenditure between 1962-63and 1963-64, only about  32 million would fall on the rates (about, a quarter)apd  92 million on the Exchequer (about three-quarters), and the proportion oflocal authority expenditure met by grant would rise to about 53-9 per. cent.8. To hold Exchequer assistance to local authorities to the present proportionof their aggregate expenditure it would be necessary to limit the increase to 66 million instead of  92 million, leaving the local authorities to bear  58 million as their share of the increase. There is a strong case on budgetary grounds for doing this.9. On the other hand, there are strong political arguments which point inthe opposite direction. Rates, and in particular householders&apos; rates, are a sensitivesubject. The revaluation will mean big increases for some, especially in ares which will not benefit from the increase in rate-deficiency grants. If we reducethe general grants it will give our opponents a chance to pin the responsibility on us and deprive us of a valuable defence. Moreover, we argued the case for not derating houses on the basis that the Exchequer would be making a substantially increased contribution by way of rate-deficiency grants, and if we offset this witha cut in the general grants we may be accused of sharp practice.10. There is also a real risk of discrediting the general grants. Theeducationists would see in the reduction confirmation of their suspicion thatthe grants were merely a device for reducing the Exchequer^ contribution tothe cost of education. No comparable cut would have been practicable in the oldeducation main grant.Conclusion11. Weighing these considerations against one another as best we can wehave reached the conclusion that a reasonable compromise would be to permit thetotal of grants to rise to 53-1 per cent, of local government expenditure, orsubstantially higher than in each of the last three years (about 52-5 per cent.).This would mean an increase in general grant as follows:or  15 million a year less than on the previous basis of calculation,. The net saving to the Exchequer will be  13 million, not  15 million, because of an offsettingincrease in rate deficiency grant. The total of general and rate deficiency grantsnext year will then be some  62 million above this year&apos;s level of  635 million anincrease of nearly 10 per cent, in one year (it was less than  500 million three yearsago). Even so, we will not be secure against all criticism the local authorities arenot likely to be satisfied but the Exchequer will, in fact, be meeting a higher proportion of local authority expenditure in 1963-64 and 1964-65: than in any year since the general grants were introduced.12.   Subject to the views of our colleagues we propose to proceed on this  million1962-^631963-641964-65519547574basis.J. A. B.-C.K. J.5th November, 1962.
