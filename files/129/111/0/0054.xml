C.(62) 204 COPY NO. JHCABINETCONGOMemorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign affairs-     BACKGROUNDWhen Mr. McGhee, the Special Envoy in the Congo of the UnitedStates Secretary of State, came here on 14th November, he told me of a plan which he had agreed with the Belgian Prime Minister,M. Spaak, in Brussels.     This was that there should be a furtherround of negotiations on the Congo with the emphasis on two points:the Constitution and the division of the revenues.    As regards theConstitution there might be a constitutional conference, perhaps withsome outside mediation.    As regards the revenues, there should bean objective assessment of the respective needs of the CentralGovernment and the Provinces by the International Monetary fund and guarantees to the Prime Minister of Katanga, Mr. Tshombe,that his requirements in foreign exchange would be adequately met.If the matter was handled in this way, Mr. Tshombe might wellagree that the Union Miniere should transfer its payments to theCentral Government.2.      M. Spaak agreed to go along with Mr. McGhee&apos;s plan but, atthe same time, expressed a preference for an alternative idea - ahigh-level meeting in New York, to be summoned by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, U Thant, and attended by the PrimeMinister of the Central Government of the Congo, Mr. Adoula, andMr, Tshombe and the Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom, theUnited States and Belgium.3.      On Mr. McGhee&apos;s return to New York for further discussionwith U Thant, the idea emerged of a two or three-man mission to the congo in order to press Mr. McGhee&apos;a plan oa both sides.    If a three-man one, the mission would be composed of Mr. McGhee,M.    Rothschild and M.    Robillart of the Union Miniere;  if a two-manone, the latter two only.     The idea of a three-man mission ran intoopposition at the United Nations, where it was apparently consideredthat Mr. McGhee&apos;s ideas were a departure from the original united nations plan.    For the same reason U Thant rejected the idea ofarbitration by the International Monetary Fund.    Instead it was proposed that the two Belgians alone should go to Eeopoldville inorder to work out an agreement between the Central Government and-1-
and the Union Miniere by which the revenues would be paid to theCentral Government and the proper share paid back to Mr, Tshombeand the Union Miniere.     This at once put the main onus of a settle-ment on the Belgians.    Mr. McGhee telegraphed to M, Spaak to saythat, although he had tried to shield the Union Miniere and the belgians, they must now face the realities of the situation.4.     Alarmed by this development, M. Spaak went to New York for consultations with the Americans and the United Nations.    Hediscovered that the United Nations were unwilling to extend theumbrella of the United Nations to either the three-man or the two-man mission.    In Washington M. Spaak was persuaded to agree to a white House communique which said that the Americans and Belgianswere in agreement upon the necessity of putting into force the laterphases of the United Nations plan, including severe economic measures if no substantial progress were made in a very short period of time.    In spite of this, M.    Spaak succeeded in persuading the President to adopt his proposal for a high-level meeting in new York to be summoned by the Secretary-General,    Subsequentlyhe also secured the agreement of U Thant to this proposal.   It wasagreed that the United Nations representative in the Congo,Mr. Gardiner, should be sent to Leopoldville to press Mr, Adoulato attend the meeting, which would also be attended by two or three members of U Thant&apos;s Congo Advisory Committee.    Mr. Tshombewould be summoned at a later stage and would be told that he must accept without argument what had been agreed,5.      When M. Rothschild passed through London on 30th Novemberhe pressed me on behalf of M. Spaak to agree to participate in theproposed meeting.    It was clear however that the Americans and theUnited Nations were not particularly anxious that I should do so, nodoubt on account of our attitude towards sanctions.    I told M. Rothschild that my preliminary view was that it would be better that I should not go.    If the question of coercive measures arose Iwould be obliged to re-affirm Her Majesty&apos;s Governments reserva-tions.     This view has subsequently been re-affirmed to the belgians.6.      The Secretary-General published in New York on29th November the full text of the &quot;Plan for Reconciliation&quot; and the&quot;Course of Action&quot; which sets out the proposals for coercivemeasures.    In order to make clear Her Majesty&apos;s governments position, guidance was issued to the Press here to the effect thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government generally support and endorse theUnited Nations plan for reconciliation but continue to reserve their position on certain parts of the &quot;Course of Action&quot;.    Notwithstand-ing these reservations, if the United Nations decided to imposesanctions as a means of ending the secession    of Katanga, her majesty&apos;s Government would not seek to prevent their application.7.      The Foreign Minister of the Central Congo Government,Mr. Bomboko, passed through London on 2nd December and was seen by an official of the Foreign Office.    He expressed doubt-2-
whether Mr. Adoula would in fact be able to attend the meeting in new York in view of the weakness of his position and the intrigues andsubversion of Mr. Tshombe and the Communist bloc embassies.Mr. Bomboko was much exercised by reports of an agreementbetween Mr. Tshombe and the leaders of two Northern RhodesianParties, Mr. Kaunda of the United National Independence Party, andMr. Nkumbula of the African National Congress.    He saw the two latter here later in the day.D.     THE AMERICAN AND UNITED NATIONS CASE8.      Both the Americans and the United Nations are preoccupied with two dangers:-(a) That the United Nations will run out of money by the spring of 1963 at the latest and will have no alternative but to withdraw or at least to change the character of their operation and give up any hope of putting effective pressure on Mr. Tshombe.     U Thant seemsto believe that member nations will not vote further funds unless hecan show that his operation in the Congo is making real progress in bringing about the re-integration of Katanga.     The proceeds ofUnited Nations Bonds can only be a stop-gap.(b) That Mr. Adoula&apos;s Government will fall unless they canachieve the early reunification of the Congo.    Mr. Adoula!s positionis now undoubtedly weak.    A majority of the Lower House present was against him on the recent vote of no confidence, even though there was neither a two-thirds majority against him nor a sufficiently strong adverse vote to take the matter to the Upper House,where he could have been forced to resign by a simple majority ofthe whole House.    In a report of 30th November, H. M. Ambassadorexpressed the view that Mr. Adoula&apos;s Government could only surviveand regain sufficient initiative and authority to tackle the country&apos;sreal social and economic problems if they could first bring Katanga&apos;ssecession to an end.9.      Whether rightly or wrongly, U Thant believes that his personal standing and reputation is at stake in the Congo and that thefailure of the United Nations to find a solution would be a seriousblow to the organisation.     The Americans appear to share thisview and have said that they are determined that the operation in the congo shall succeed.10.     The nub of the United Nations1 and Americans&apos; case is thatany Central Government in Leopoldville are bound to do everything possible to secure the reintegration of Katanga.     There is still a chance that this can be achieved by Mr. Adoula&apos;s moderate pro-Western Government with the support of the United Nations and the interested Governments.    If the opportunity is not seized in the short time still remaining, Mr. Adoula would be almost certain to be replaced by a more extreme Government.     This mightinitially be under the Minister of the Interior in the Central-3-
Government, Mr. Kamitatu, whose attitude during the recent Govern-ment crisis was far from loyal and whom Mr. Adoula does not trust.Mr. Kamitatu, if he came to power, might only be a stepping-stoneto a yet more extreme Government, e, g. , under Mr. Gizenga (theformer head of the Stanleyville Government) whose early release from prison now seems likely.    An extreme Government inLeopoldville might, after the withdrawal of the United Nations, seekhelp from other African countries in an &quot;anti &quot;imperialist&quot; campaign to subdue Mr. Tshombe.     This would be likely to be accompaniedby an increase of Communist bloc influence in Leopoldville and perhaps by the supply of bloc equipment, if not manpower.11.     As the United Nations and the Americans see it, therefore,the best hope is to put the strongest possible pressure on mr. Tshombe, including if necessary sanctions, in order to avoid the far worse alternative of a resort to force by an anti-WesternCentral Government supported by other African countries andpossibly the Soviet bloc.    Both the Americans and the United nations have frequently told us that it is their strong hope that Mr. Tshombecan be brought to accept terms (he would not be destroyed) withoutresort to force.    They believe that if there was sufficientsolidarity among the countries concerned, the threat of sanctionsmight alone do the trick.    If not, sanctions themselves would haveto be applied, perhaps in graduated doses, to convince Mr. Tshombethat everyone concerned was in earnest.    They have pointed out thatthe history of the past two years has made it clear that negotiation with Mr. Tshombe is useless by itself because he has no intention ofgiving up positions unless he is forced to.    Progress has only been achieved under pressure.12.     While being opposed in principle to the use of force, theUnited Nations - and probably also the Americans - believe, however that effective pressure cannot be put on Mr, Tshombe without some risk that it would lead to fighting.     The embargo on copper andcobalt foreshadowed in the&quot;Course of Action&quot;was chosen because itwould minimise this risk.    Other forms of pressure would be more likely to provoke violent Katangan reactions, e. g. , if theUnited Nations tried to seal off the southern routes by which thebulk of Katanga&apos;s copper, etc. is now exported.    It is a con-comitant of the United Nations&quot; willingness to apply strong pressurethat they believe that in the event of an armed clash started byMr, Tshombe they have sufficient force to deal with him.    TheUnited Nations believe that the situation elsewhere in the Congo isnow sufficiently stable for them, if necessary, to move furthertroops and equipment into Katanga, leaving the African national congress to take over their security duties further north.    the americans have recently made air transport available to the united nations for the purpose (initially) of moving vehicles toElisabethville,13,     The Belgians, though they supported the &quot;Course of Action&quot;and the proposals recently worked out in New York, are in an-4-
9 9 9*v d* t)unhappy position.     They do not feel able to oppose sanctions or todissociate themselves from them if they are proposed by the united nations.    They are, on the other hand, anxious if possible to avoidaction which could harm the Union Miniere and which might have repercussions in Belgian internal politics.    It is for this reason that M. Spaak tried to persuade me to take part in the proposedconsultations in New York with Mr, Adoula and possibly Mr. Tshombe.The probability is that if the United Nations, with American support,eventually call for sanctions, the Belgians would reluctantly play their part;  but they are likely to do everything they decently can towriggle out.In&apos;   THE UNITED KINGDOM CASE14. We have all along seen the problem of reunifying the Congo ina somewhat different light. Mr. Tshombe began his secession whenthe rest of the Congo was plunging into chaos and anti-Europeanhysteria under Mr. Lumumba. Although it is our policy to work forthe peaceful reunification of the Congo and we accepted and supported the Proposal for National Reconciliation, we do not believe that apoliticalsettlement should be imposed by force or threat of force; if itwere it could not be lasting. For this reason we reserved ourposition on those parts of the&quot;Course of Action&quot;which foreshadowedthe threat or use of sanctions which, in our view, could easily leadto fighting. Though we did not say so publicly, we informed theUnited Nations, the Americans and the Belgians that, if an embargowere imposed on Katanga&apos;s copper exports, we would probably haveto take action to limit our own imports of copper to their existing level (about 3, 000 tons a year) to avoid disruption to. the london market.15.    At the   same time we have been conscious of the need toavoid encouraging Mr. Tshombe to be intransigent and to avoiddrawing upon ourselves odium at the United Nations and elsewhere forundermining the attempts of the United Nations to bring about asolution.    We have accordingly stated that, if the United Nationsdecide to impose sanctions as a means of ending the secession of katanga, we would not seek to prevent their application.    We havealso warned Mr, Tshombe that we could not and would not oppose theuse of such pressure by others.16.    In the present state of deadlock over the application of theProposal for National Reconciliation, we recognise that Mr. Tshombehas been stalling, but we do not think that the blame lies entirelyupon him.    Mr, Adoula rejected the cease-fire agreement atfirst approved by his representative in Leopoldville in October.He has resisted pressure by the United Nations to allow them toshow the draft constitution to Mr. Tshombe and invite his comments.(Mr, Tshombe equally chose to absent himself when copies of theConstitution were given to other Provincial Presidents inLeopoldville in October. )    The Central Government have also failed-5-
LUWHUfclU I \kiso far to enact or decree an amnesty in accordance with the united nations plan, though President Kasavubu has pronounced an amnestyin a public speech.17,    Our position is, therefore, that the scope for negotiations hasnot been exhausted and that pressure on both sides, and not just on mr. Tshombe, will be needed to bring about a reasonable settle-ment, including in particular an agreement on the sharing ofKatangars taxes and revenues balanced against an acceptablefederal constitution.    (The difficulty about balancing these two basicelements is that the Federal Constitution is now in the hands of theCentral Parliament and it will take a long time for it to go throug hall the stages required by the procedure in the Loi Fondamentale.This means that satisfaction on the Constitution for Mr. Tshombeand the sharing of revenues could not be balanced in terms of timing; unless Mr. Tshombe&apos;s payments to the Central Governmentremained on a provisional basis until the constitutional procedurehad been completed.)IV*   ^QgSIBLE SCOFF FOR INITIATIVE BY HER MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT &quot; &apos; &quot;&quot;18.    Tf Mr. Adoula refuses U Thant&apos;s invitation to New York (andthe two- or three-man rolooion.-*i8 not revived) or if Mr. Tshomborejects ouch further proposals as may be agreed, the re, may bo - ,scope for an initiative.by Hur Majesty&apos;? Government before. bo united nations have recourse to sanctions.    The basis of such an initiativemight be:-(a) that the International Monetary Fund or some similarbody should be called in to assess Katanga&apos;capacity to pay part of her revenues and taxes tothe Central Government and to recommend whatthe proportion should be;  and(b) that there should be independent arbitration, for exampleby the Prime Minister of Nigeria or the Presidentof Senegal, on the Constitution.    Mr, Tshombewould be asked to define (which he has not yetdone) precisely what are his objections to thepresent draft and Mr. Adoula would be pressed to accept any suggestions which were consistent with the outline in the Proposal for NationalReconciliation,19.    The difficulties in the way of such an initiative might be:-(i) U Thant was not attracted by the suggestion of arbitra-tion by the International Monetary Fund, thoughhis reasons were not very convincing.     We couldargue that the Americans themselves have now accepted that a 50-50 split of revenues and foreign exchange is unrealistic.    Mr. Tshombe hasoffered to allow his accounts to be inspected to
coMUULMIIALdetermine his capacity to pay.    It would belogical to take him up on this and face him withthe opinion of an impartial body.    If he rejectedthis opinion he would put himself clearly in the wrong.(ii)  Mr. Adoula has consistently refused to &quot;consult&quot;Mr. Tshombe about the terms of the Constitutioneither directly or through the intermediary ofthe United Nations.    He has taken this line because it is, as he sees it, impossible for him to treatMr. Tshombe as an equal negotiator withoutirretrievably damaging his position in Leopoldville.The recent weakening of his position and the concessions he has been obliged to make to hiscritics make it still less likely that he could be induced to compromise on this point.    We might conceivably persuade him to do so if we wereprepared to give an assurance that, in the eventof this new initiative breaking down because ofMr. Tshombe&apos;s intransigence or evasiveness,we would then be ready to join the United nations and other countries in taking coercive measures.20.    More broadly, a British initiative would need careful considera-tion for two further reasons.    First, we might be suspected by theUnited Nations and other Governments of seeking only to confusethe issue and to gain further time for Mr. Tshombe.    Secondly, wewould by taking the initiative be assuming a measure of responsibilityfor ensuring its success.    For both these reasons it might benecessary, in order to persuade Mr. Adoula to give our proposals afair run and also to reassure the United Nations and other Govern-ments about our good intentions, to undertake a commitment to givepositive support to coercive measures if Mr, Tshombe blockedfurther progress.    If, however, wewsre ready to support sanctionsin the context of our own initiative, it might be asked why we are unwilling to give similar backing to the United Nations plan.21.    If we were to consider stating our readiness, in the context of a British initiative, to impose sanctions in the last resort, it couldbe argued that such sanctions might logically have to be appliedagainst Mr. Adoula as well as against Mr. Tshombe, if the formerrather than the latter were responsible for blocking agreement.Given the present mood at the United Nations and in Africa, it isinconceivable that we could expect any wide measure of support fromother countries for sanctions against the Central Government,irrespective of where the blame lay.    In any case few, if any,   othercountries would be willing to lay the blame upon Mr. Adoula,    for practical purposes, therefore, we would have to accept that a commitment by Her Majesty&apos;s Government to join in the applicationof sanctions would be one-sided, directed only at Mr. Tshombe.-7-
S% S\ after.    FURTHER POSSIBILITIES22.    Even the advocates of the present United Nations/Americanpolicy concede that there is no certainty of arriving at a solution in the near future.     The application of sanctions, if we reach that stage, might fail to bring Mr. Tshombe to heel.     The attempt might lead to fighting;  and, though the United Nations may be confident of winning a battle for Elizabethville, it is much less certain that theycould subdue and pacify the whole of Katanga if Mr. Tshombe and hisGovernment withdrew to the bush and conducted a guerrilla campaign.The application of sanctions would do temporary damage to Katanga&apos;economy;  that would be its object.    An outbreak of fighting could do much more permanent damage and impose a huge burden of reconstruction.23.    If the present United Nations initiative led to neither asolution nor to the destruction or crippling of Katanga&apos;s economy,and if Her Majesty&apos;s Government took no initiative before there wasrecourse to force, there would remain a further possibility.The United Nations could admit failure and leave the Congolese tosort out their differences according to their own lights.     This wouldnot in theory mean the total withdrawal of the United Nationspresence;  the United Nations could change the character of their operation to a programme of economic assistance.    But in practice it is difficult to believe that there would, at the United Nations,be a sufficient measure of support for an economic programme, once the political objective of reunifying the Congo had been abandoned.The alternatives seem therefore to be either the successful conclusion of the present United Nations plan (or of somethingsimilar to it) or1 the total withdrawal of the United Nations as an effective power in the Congo.24.    The consequences of this are difficult to calculate.    Nodoubt individual Governments, in particular the Americans, would continue to give the Central Government economic assistance;  and,even if the United Nations as such withdrew, the Central Govern-ment might be able to retain the services of economic advisers on loan or in their individual capacities.    It is by no means certain,therefore, that the Congo&apos;s economy would collapse, though itsrecovery would no doubt be retarded.25.    It is also worth considering whether it might be possible togo for some lesser objective than the reunification of the Congo,for example an agreement on the sharing of revenues between mr. Tshombe and the Central Government, which would still leaveMr. Tshombe in an independent political position, perhaps even with links with other territories like Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland.    It must, however, be doubtful whether, once theUnited Nations had admitted failure, Mr. Tshombe would have anyincentive to make an ex gratia division of his revenues with theCentral Government;  and it is quite likely that the latter would inany case refuse to receive such payments.- 8-
26.    H. M. Ambassador has made it clear that, in his view, noCentral Government in Leopoldville could renounce Katanga and remain in power.    A United Nations withdrawal would thus belikely to be followed by an attempt by the Central Government(probably no longer led by Mr. Adoula) to go it alone or perhapswith the help of African countries.    To this extent the logic of theAmerican and United Nations thesis seems valid.27.    How dangerous such a situation could be, and how far theCommunist bloc would be able to exploit it, is difficult to say with certainty.     It is possible that Mr. Tshombe would be strong enoughto ward off an attack by the Central Government and its externalallies and that there would be a de facto stalemate and an uneasytruce between the two sides.    Alternatively, Mr. Tshombe mightfinally be brought to his knees by superior force and the country might be reunited, even though it would be ruined in the process.In either event Western interests would be likely to suffer.    If theCentral Government and their African allies failed to subdueMr. Tshombe we would bear the odium of earlier refusing togivemore effective help through the United Nations and for (allegedly)supporting Mr. Tshombe,     If the attack on Mr. Tshombe succeededthe Union Miniere would be ruined and the Central Governmentwould probably hold the West responsible for the damage to Katanga&apos;economy which, they might argue, would have been unnecessary ifeffective pressure had been put on Mr. Tshombe at the right time.28.    The Communist bloc would, without needing to intervene,reap political benefits equivalent to the West&apos;s political losses.They would no doubt do all they could to encourage the CentralGovernment in their campaign against Mr. Tshombe and to enlist the support of other African countries.     They might also givelogistical help.     Without, therefore, risking a dangerous politicalinvolvement, they might well be able to make up for their earliermismanagement of the situation in I960.29.    It remains to consider whether there would be any chance,in the &quot;post Cuba&quot; atmosphere, of an understanding between the&quot;West and the Russians to refrain from intervention.    As already mentioned, the Russians would not in fact need to intervene, in anostentatious physical sense, in order to draw considerable dividendsIt would seem unrealistic to expect them either to make or to keepan agreement to refrain from cashing in to this extent.    Theywould be likely to interpret any &quot;Western approach as either aconfession of weakness and failure, and thus as a tacit encourage-ment to themselves, or as an attempt to secure for the West a free hand in Katanga.CONCLUSIONS30.  (a) There is a chance that the present United Nationsinitiative may produce the desired result.    It will entail servingan ultimatum on Mr. Tshombe and being willing to back this up with a threat of sanctions.    I think, however, that Mr. Tshombewould fight if it came to the point of the use of force by the united nations.-9-
(b) Any British initiative would have to be delayed at least until the present United Nations plan had got into difficulties either because Mr, Adoula refused the invitation to New York or because it proved impossible to reach an agreement with him there or becauseMr. Tshombe rejected such an agreement.(c) We would, however, have to be very careful not only about the timing of an initiative but also about the way our proposals were put.    Otherwise our intentions might easily be misunderstood.If this were to be avoided we should probably have to express a readiness to join in sanctions if our initiative failed because ofMr, Tshombe&apos;s attitude,(d) If the United Nations cannot soon bring about a solutionthere will probably be no alternative to their withdrawal from the congo.     This could be damaging to the reputation of the united nations and of the Secretary-General.    It would not necessarilylead to an economic catastrophe in the Congo,    The United Nationsmight avoid damage to their reputation by going for the international monetary Fund solution of the revenue problem and putting thepolitical future of the Congo in cold storage.    It is however doubtful if the Afro-Asians would allow this.31, I have given my colleagues a very long and detailed analysis.32, I do not accept that the United Nations and United Statesreasons for action have much validity.     The only one that has somesubstance is that Mr, Adoula may fall and let in the Left, whichwould let in the Russians.    But Mr. Adoula is quite likely to fallanyway through intrigue,33, On the other hand I do not believe that sanctions shouldbe applied to impose a political settlement in the Congo or anywhereelse.    If the United Nations tried to interfere in such a way, they wouldhe   exceeding their mandate, courting failure because they were soweak and risking grave damage to their future,34,        If they were to defeat Mr. Tshombe they would have to occupy the country for years.    It is almost sure that the UnionMiniere would be destroyed in the process and could probably never be rebuilt.    For the reasons given I therefore prefer our line,but I would welcome the advice of my colleagues.H.Foreign Office, S.W.1,7th December, 1962,-10-
