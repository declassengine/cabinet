(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSIC.162JL.202. COPY NO.CABINETREDUCTION IN HOURS IN THE SCOTTISH&quot;&quot;       BUILDING. industry memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the employers and trade union representatives in the buildingindustry in Scotland agreed on 16th November on a reduction of the normal working week in the industry from 42 hours to 40 without loss of pay as from 1st November, 1963.    This settlement was triggered off by asimilar settlement recently negotiated for a comparatively small group of Scottish plumbers.    In itself the reduction in hours, without loss of pay, is equivalent to an increase of 5 per cent in the hourlyrate of pay.    Assuming that the actual number of hours worked inScotland will remain over 47 a week on average, as at present, theeffect of this settlement will be to increase the earnings of 90, 000Scottish building workers by over 7 per cent.     These workers havealready received increases totalling about 16 per cent since October,1961, (partly in the form of a reduction in the working week from44 hours to 42).2. This case illustrates the serious effects which can be created by a pay settlement which may not, at first sight, appear to be of verygreat importance.    Faced by sporadic industrial unrest the Scottishbuilding employers appear to have given in without much of a fight.They were relatively well placed to do so.     The building industry isalmost wholly protected from foreign competition, it is prosperous(thanks in part to large-scale public contracts) and by delaying theintroduction of the new concession for almost twelve months theemployers have ensured that they can pass most of the cost on to their customers.3. On the other hand the building industry is a key industry in pay matters both because of its size and because building workerswork alongside those in many other industries.     The recent settlement is bound to react directly on the building industry in England and wales and on the civil engineering industry throughout Great Britain.Ultimately the repercussions may be much wider still.4. It was precisely to secure that settlements of this sort,which appear to conflict sharply with the public interest, should be subjected to full impartial and public scrutiny, that the Governmentreserved the right (as described in the White Paper on the national incomes Commission, Cmnd, 1844, paragraph 4(iii)) to refer settle-ments to the National Incomes Commission (N. I. C.) for retrospective2; fc&apos;
examination.   The Wages Committee have considered the Scottishplumbers&quot; and builders&apos; cases described above and are in no doubt thatthey ought to be referred to the Commission without delay.     TheEnglish building employe rs and the British Employers Confederationhave both privately urged this course.Ministerial responsibility for making the reference5. The White Paper says no more than that a reference of this type will be made by a Minister of the Crown.     It might be natural for formal action to be taken by the Minister most closely concerned withthe affairs of the industry in question, e.g. , the Minister of public building and Works in the case of the building industry, the Presidentof the Board of Trade in that of engineering, chemicals, textiles,etc. , and so on.    On the other hand, the main purpose of a reference toN. I. C. is to protect the national interest in the widest sense and thecircumstances and interests of a particular industry or of a particulardepartmental Minister may prove to be only one of a wide range of considerations which the Commission will need to examine.    For thisreason the Wages Committee came to the conclusion that, on balance,it would be preferable for references to N. I. C. to be made by treasury Ministers, who have a central responsibility in economic affairs and are concerned particularly with incomes policy, as one aspect of the Governments general economic policies.Form of reference6. The formal reference of a settlement to the N. I. C. forretrospective examination would be made in an official communication to the Commission, a copy of which would be sent to the parties to thesettlement for information.     It is for consideration how fully the reference should set out the reasons which had led the Government tomake it.    If too much detail were given, the Government might appearto be pleading the case and pre-judging the outcome of theCommission^ enquiry.    Any such impression might both embarrass the Commission and alienate the parties concerned, thus increasingthe difficxxlty of obtaining evidence in this particular case and ingeneral making the voluntary reference of current claims to N, I. C.less likely.    On the other hand the Government are likely to be questioned on each reference and will need at least to say enough toexplain why it was judged that there was a jjHm^Jacie^case for examination.    A draft reference for the Scottish plumbers&apos; andbuilders&apos; agreements is annexed. l ^JXLi^lJ2M?lig- announ c erne nt7, The making of a reference to N. I. C. ought to be publicly announced as soon as practicable after the formal letter of reference has been sent.    Such an announcement could be made, whilstParliament was sitting, in reply to an arranged parliamentary question or, in a particularly important case, by a statement after-2-
QuestionsBut to announce the first case in Parliament would set a precedent for subsequent cases which might later prove embarrassing.The Wages Committee felt that at least on the first occasion it mightbe desirable to limit publicity to a statement for the Press whichwould follow the same lines as the formal reference.    In order togive greater formality to the announcement, the text of the reference might also be inserted in the London and Edinburgh Gazettes and inthe Ministry of Labour Gazette.Conclusionsj-8. I invite the Cabinet to agree that:-(a)    the recent agreements for the reduction of hoursrelating to Scottish plumbers and to the Scottishbuilding industry should be referred to theNational Incomes Commission for retrospectiveexamination in accordance with paragraph 4(iii)of Cmnd. 1844;(b)the reference (and other references of this type)should be made by the Treasury on my behalf inthe form of the draft annexed;(c)the Government1 s action should be announced bypublishing the formal reference to the Commissionin the London and Edinburgh Gazettes and byreleasing it to the Press.R.M.TreasuryChambers, S.W.1.3rd December, 1962.-3-
On 16th November, 1962, the Scottish National Euilding TradesFederation (Employers) and the National Federation of Building TradeOperatives (Scottish Section) announced that they had reached agreement(the &quot;Scottish builders1 agreement&quot;) on the reduction of the normal working week from 42 hours to 40 hours without loss of pay from4th November, 1963.     This followed a similar agreement between theSdottish Federation of Plumbers and Domestic Engineers (Employers)Association and the Plumbing Trade Union (the &quot;Scottish plumbers&apos;agreement&quot;) which was reached in May, 1962, and took effect from 1st October, 1962.Since the actual number of weekly hours worked in theconstruction industries in Scotland is on average substantially greaterthan 42, the principal effect of both agreements seems likely to be toincrease the effective rates of remuneration of the workers concerned and to increase the costs of the industry.     Taking into account:-(a) the fact that hourly rates of pay for building workersin Scotland have already been increased by about15 per cent since October, 1961, when the standardworking week was last reduced from 44 to 42 hours;(b) the damage to the public interest which could beoccasioned by a further increase in costs in an industry which is largely protected from foreigncompetition and in which labour costs account for a large proportion of total costs;(c) the possibility that the agreements might have repercussions in other employments;the Chancellor of the Exchequer is satisfied that the effect of theScottish builders&apos;and Scottish plumbers&apos; agreements on the remunera-tion of the workers concerned and on the costs of the industry makes it advisable in the public interest that these agreements should be examined by the National Incomes Commission.     The Commission is accordingly requested to undertake such an examination, in accordancewith its terms of reference as set out in a Royal Warrant dated5th November, 1962, and described in Cmnd. 1844.-4-annex draft REFERENCE TO THE NATIONAL INCOMES*       &quot; COMMISSION&apos; &quot;
