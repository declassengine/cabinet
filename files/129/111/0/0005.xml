confidential.(62) 155CAEINETIMPORTS,OF1 COTTON TSXTILES FROli PAKISTANMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade on 6th June, 1962 I informed Parliament that Hong Kong had offered to continue until the end of 1965 the present ceiling on importsof piece goods and garments and to introduce a new limit on yarnimports at the 1961 level (Hansard, Column 467).    I said that this offer was subject to the acceptance of similar arrangements by Indiaand Pakistan, which I was expecting shortly.     Lancashire has taken this as a firm indication of the Governments intentions, on whichfuture action can be based. ,2.     At the end of July I informed the Cabinet (C. (62) 130) that india had offered a similar undertaking, subject to acceptance byPakistan, but that Fakistan was asking for substantial increases.The Cabinet then agreed that if Pakistan could not be persuaded togive a voluntary undertaking the Government would themselves haveto take steps to ensure that imports from Pakistan did not exceed theproposed levels (C.C. (62) 52nd Conclusions, Minute 3),3.      Eefore the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting I agreed,in deference to the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s view that some concession to Pakistan would sweeten the attitude of president Ayub Khan over the Common Market, to accept anincrease in the figure for yarn to the I960 level, which was thebest for Pakistan of the last three years, on condition that this didnot lead to any increase in the figures for India and Hong Kong.After difficult discussions, President Ayub informed theCommonwealth Secretary that the least that Pakistan could acceptwould be the 1956 figure for yarn and an annual increase of 5 percent in the ceiling figure for yarn and cloth.     This was laterrepeated in a letter from the Fakistan High Commissioner.4.      In the meantime, without any prior notice to us, therepresentative of Pakistan at the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade entered an objection to the United Kingdom reservation to thelong-term arrangement for cotton textiles, which relieved us fromany obligation to increase the ceiling of imports during the fiveyears for which the arrangement will run.    Pie offered to withdraw his objection if we accepted President Ayub&apos;s demands.    This were fused to do and Pakistan has maintained her objection.-1-COPY NO.-51CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER britannic majesty&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
CONFIDENTIALBoard of Trade, S. W. 1.11th October, 1962-2-/- \CONFIDENTIAL/i *5.      Pakistan has now offered to withdraw her demand for growth in yarn and cloth imports if we will give her the 1956figure for yarn.     This I cannot accept.     Though the amountsat stake may seem small (the 1961 figure was 0. 6 million lbs. ,the I960 figure 1, 4 million lbs. and the 1956-7 figure2. 56 million lbs. ) tJjtffrStev&amp;eafts equal to the yarn content of severalmillion yards QijSl^^-&apos; *&quot;kis is not the issue;  any increasein the figure, faoyov&amp;g- small, would be taken by Lancashire,which regards the present level of imports as grossly excessive,as yet another indication that when there is a clash of interestbetween a Commonwealth exporter and the domestic industry,it is always the domestic industry that is the sufferer.    Thiswould shatter any hope of restoring confidence in the future ofthe industry, of which the first faint signs are at lastbeginning to appear, and wreck all prospects of adequatere-equipment and reorganisation, without which the industry will not be able to withstand competition, not only from lowcost producers in Asia but from the countries of the common market, against whom the tariff barrier will be removed after we join.,6.      The Pakistanis say that if we accepted the 1956 figure for her, India would not ask for any increase.    Hong Kongwould however certainly ask for one, and it would be inequitableto withhold from a territory which has been helpful and co-operative, a concession forced from us by the blackmailingtactics of Pakistan.    Any concession to Hong Kong wouldcertainly have to be extended to India;   this we should have torefuse, and the whole basis of the voluntary undertakingswould then be jeopardised.7,      The annual conference of the Cotton Eoard begins on19th October.    Before then I must inform the industry what arrangements are to operate after the end of 1962;  indeed,such a statement is long overdue.     I consider that the cabinet decision of 1st August, 1962 (C. C. (62) 52nd Conclusions,Minute 3) should be reaffirmed;  that Pakistan should now be told firmly that in the absence of an undertaking from her, weshall have no option but to impose the limits which   we have asked her to accept;  and that I should make this clear in thestatement which I propose to issue within the next forty-eight hours.     This decision will no doubt be taken ill by Pakistan,but I find it hard to believe that it will seriously prejudicerelations or add materially to the bad feeling which the difficultdiscussions during and since the Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting havealready caused.   In any event, if the choice lies betweenannoying Pakistan and breaking faith with Lancashire, I have nodoubt what it should be.F. J. E.
