THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1962C. (62) 165 Copy No.   gj[26th October, 1962CABINETIMMUNITIES AND PRIVILEGES: INTERNATIONAL and commonwealth ORGANISATIONSNote by the Secretary of the cabinet at their meeting on 29th May the Cabinet considered a memorandum bythe then Lord Chancellor (C. (62) 80) suggesting principles which might beadopted for determining the extension of diplomatic immunities and privileges to international and Commonwealth organisations established in this country. Inthe Cabinefs discussion the then Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, althoughthe underlying intention of the memorandum was to restrict the grant of immunities and privileges, the result of adopting these principles might in practice be seriousfor the revenue; and the Cabinet instructed me to arrange for the practical results to be examined. I attach a summary of the conclusions reached by officials of theDepartments concerned on this point.(Signed)      NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,26th October, 1962.
Annex -IMMUNITIES AND PRIVILEGES: INTERNATIONAL and commonwealth ORGANISATIONSSummary of Conclusions reached by officials in paragraph 15 of C. (62) 80 the then Lord Chancellor suggested that international organisations should not as a general rule be accepted as eligiblefor the grant of immunities and privileges unless their primary function was themaking or co-ordination of policy; and that the immunities and privileges grantedto organisations and individuals should be limited to what was required for the necessities of each case. He also suggested that Commonwealth organisations which would qualify if the members were foreign countries should have treatmentcomparable with that given to international organisations: no more and no less.2. To judge the practical results of applying these principles would involvea detailed assessment of how each existing and proposed organisation would beaffected by their adoption. Such an assessment could be no more than speculationand it has not been attempted. Even within the limited field of organisationsalready in being, or in immediate prospect, it has been difficult (because of the lack of information readily available and the large element of subjective judgmentwhich has to be applied) to reach agreed views on the treatment which would be appropriate, under the principles proposed, for particular organisations and forthe individuals employed in them. It has also been difficult to distinguish betweenorganisations which are primarily policy-making and those which are not, and itis suggested that in practice the question whether immunities and privileges arerequired by a given organisation turns more on the circumstances in which theorganisation^ work has to be done than on whether it is primarily work of apolicy or of an executive character.3. Applying the principle of necessity, the following main conclusions were reached:(a) If immunities and privileges were granted to organisations and individualsonly when it is in a strict sense functionally necessary for them to begranted, few would enjoy them. In most cases, the need depends onextraneous political, economic and administrative reasons, such as those mentioned in paragraph 9 of C. (62) 80.(b) Two international organisations which now have immunity from suit (theCustoms Co-operation Council and the European Free trade association) do not need it; nor do the three Communities of the Sixneed more immunity than they have. It was not possible to reach a unanimous conclusion with regard to the European Space research organisation and the European Launcher Development Organisation.(c) If all the Commonwealth organisations which were considered had legalentity, three of them (the Commonwealth Telecommunications Board,the Commonwealth Education Liaison Committee and theCommonwealth Economic Committee) would qualify for immunity from suit.id) Inviolability of archives and premises is generally more necessary for an organisation than immunity from suit and unlikely to hurt the public.(e) The international organisations which were considered and twoCommonwealth organisations (the Commonwealth TelecommunicationsBoard and the Commonwealth Education Liaison Committee) requireexemption from taxes and rates solely for political, economic or administrative reasons. For similar reasons, the majority need thenormal customs concessions.(/) The grant of immunity from suit to individuals working for an organisationmatters less if the organisation itself is not granted immunity.
T6?(g) The individuals working for all the international organisations that were considered, except the Commodity Councils, need immunity from suitin respect of their official acts; only a few high officers need it forunofficial acts.(h) For political, economic or administrative reasons, the individuals (otherthan United Kingdom nationals) working for all the organisationswould need tax exemption on their official salaries; agreement was not reached on whether United Kingdom nationals working in the UnitedKingdom would need it or not.(i) It is estimated that the approximate numbers of individuals, permanentlylocated in the United Kingdom, for whom immunity from suit andexemption from taxes are necessary are as follows:Immunity exemption from suit from taxes(i) Existing International Organisations(present number) .........      238 253(ii) Commonwealth Organisations    ......      100 10** (a) if United Kingdom nationals, resi-dent in this country, were alsogranted exemption from taxes,approximately another 90 wouldhave to be added to the number whowould be exempt from taxes; and(b) if exemption from taxes were granted to United kingdom nationals employed by theCommonwealth AgriculturalBureaux, up to another 300 indi-viduals might have to be addedto this figure.(iii) Proposed International OrganisationsE.S.R.O. and E.L.D.O. ...      ......      Nil NilEuratom will probably have estab-lishments in the United King-dom; but the numbers of foreignersand United Kingdom nationalsworking for them will not be knownfor some time.(/) It is not possible to estimate what additional cost, if any, would fall onthe Exchequer if the Lord Chancellors principles were applied in themanner adopted in the examination: the precise cost of the present arrangements is not known. On the best guess which can be made(and it is no more than a guess) the whole cost of exemptions (not the extra cost) would be unlikely in foreseeable circumstances to amountto as much as     million.
