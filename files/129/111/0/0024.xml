P-IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)51    &apos;C. (62) 174, COPY NO.        V.1-3rd November, 1962CABINETTHE SUPERSONIC AIRLINERMemorandum by the First Secretary of state the Committee on Civil Scientific Research and Development,of which I am the chairman, have considered a proposal for a jointenterprise by British and French industry to develop an airliner withtwice the speed of sound which would come into commercial serviceabout 1970.     We have not reached any final conclusion partly because we have not hitherto had adequate opportunity of comparing this projectwith possible competitors in the scientific field.    It is fair to say thatthe Chief Secretary has reserved the Treasury point of view and thatthe Ministers of Aviation and Defence are in favour of the proposal.The Minister of Aviation wishes the matter to be considered by theCabinet at an early date.    I therefore set out certain considerations in this memorandum.2.      The Annex contains our appraisal of the facts and estimatesconcerning this proposal.3.      We have felt that the proposal is a natural manifestation of technological progress.    Supersonic military aircraft are in commonuse already;  and history has repeatedly shown that technologicaladvance in military aircraft has been successfully applied in new types of civil aircraft at a rate faster than, on purely economic grounds, the airlines would have wished.     We are inclined to believe that super-sonic passenger travel is sure to come, though two reservations havebeen suggested:  first, in other forms of travel - the railways and the motor car - there was at the outset rapid technological advance andthen the pattern of passenger travel settled at speeds which were relatively moderate compared with what was technically pocsible:   thesame pattern might repeat itself in air travel, with the use of super-sonic speeds as the exception rather than the rule.    Secondly, mostairlines are operating at a loss at present:  there may have to beradical changes in the fare structure.    It is at least possible that the changes would be directed to exploiting a new market - not so much for the businessman who can travel in luxury and must travel fast,but for the general public who want to go from place to place withinwhat they can comfortably afford.-1-
4.      The prevailing opinion in my Committee, after their studies,is that because of the unusual degree of risk the case for proceeding with the proposal cannot stand on normal expectations of an economicreturn (Annex, paragraphs 2-14), nor to any great extent upon grounds of tndicpensability to the aircraft industry (paragraphs 15-18 of the annex).     The commercial judgment of the manufacturers is expressedin their keen advocacy of this project, and their willingness to commita large part of their resources to it for many years, but against thissome members of my Committee set the fact that the United Kingdomcompanies look to public funds to bear all our share of the pre-production costs (paragraph 2 of the Annex).    I have also sought theviews of the British Overseas Airways Corporation.    They have explained that if they were looking at this question purely from thecommercial point of view they would have preferred to enter into no commitment.    They emphasised that what is important is to havethe best plane rather than to be first in the field with a new plane.From this point of view, therefore, it would suit them best to sit onthe side-lines while supersonic airliners are developed and to decide to order the most likely winner when developments are a lot furtherforward than they are now.    On the other hand, they recognise thatas a nationalised corporation they have certain obligations and that ifthe Government decide to go ahead with this project they and they alonecan provide the operating experience and advice which the builderswill need.    In view, however, of their x*ecent heavy financial lossesthey cannot afford to do this unless the Government agree to under-write the risk until such time as a commercial judgment can be made.They are accordingly ready to be associated with this development onthe conditions summarised in paragraph 4 of the Annex.     TheMinisters of Defence and Aviation, however, consider that there is greater merit in the economic case than their colleagues in theCommittee have found.5.     Suppose we went ahead with this project.    There is room fordoubt whether the technological advance could be fruitfully exploitedfor any length of time.    It would not suffice for a further increase inspeed to three times that of sound, because this would require different methods and different materials.    The Americans, however, havebeen studying the possibility of this still more advanced and costlyvehicle and if they decide to go ahead would hope to be producing it byabout 1975.    They have come from behind us in this way before, when their Boeing 707 followed our Comets and Britannias,    Nor can wediscount altogether the possibility that, despite our lead in a designfor twice the speed of sound, they could even now bring a comparableaircraft into production good enough and soon enough to spoil our market (paragraph 9 of the Annex).    The Russians too may be in the race.    Moreover, while it might well be that except in partnership with the French (the Americans will almost certainly wish to &quot;go italone&quot;) we could not tackle supersonic airliners at all, it mightdetract from any credit to our industry that the project had been under-taken jointly with the French, who would take the larger share ofdevelopment work for the airframe and already know the aircraft as the&quot;Super-Caravelle&quot;.    On the other hand the venture would be an out-standing example of interdependence and would help to promote the integration of the aircraft industries of Western Europe.-2-
6.      In the techniques of civil passenger transport the proposed air-liner would be a long stride ahead of any airliner flying now;  journeytimes would be markedly reduced, especially on long flights;  in company with the French we could get in first with the assurance of atleast a substantial part of the European airliner market;  if the projectwere both technically and commercially successful and completed ontime a very substantial volume of export business would be obtained,and our aircraft industry would be assured of a place in the front rank of the world&apos;s suppliers of large civil aircraft, at least some way intothe 19?0&apos;s;  in the competition for civil air passenger traffic some ofour airlines at least could enjoy for a time some advantage frompioneering a very much faster aircraft;  and we might expect on past experience to reap from the project advances in technology whichcould help industries besides the aircraft industry.7.     As for the technological argument, there are two other aspectsto be considered.    First, if we were to undertake this airliner wouldthere be a risk of having spread our effort too wide, of completingprojects too late or abandoning them half done ?    We have noted thelarge nuclear programmes, the space research programme, our contributions to the European Launcher Development Organisation andto the European Space Research Organisation and the possibility of a civil  satellite communications system.    Subject to the views of theChancellor of the Exchequer, whose position has been reserved in my committee&apos;s discussions, we do not think it likely that if the super-sonic airliner project went ahead successfully these projects orprogrammes would be affected.    But while there is ample capacity inthe aircraft industry and Government aeronautical establishments toundertake the project, we have noted also the effort devoted in various ways to civil scientific and industrial research and development.and weare not in a position to say that resources devoted to a supersonic air-liner might not be better directed to other industries on which our future economy may depend more heavily than upon the manufacture oflarge civil aircraft.8.     To sum up, this proposal may well constitute a natural andinevitable step in technological advance, offering the benefits of suchadvance and a moment of opportunity to enhance British and Frenchprestige, but we may find in later years that United States ind.ustryousts it with something better, and we are left v/ith too small a market for our pains.    And some of usbelieve that the right lines of technological-logical advance for this country to exploit cannot be selected without regard to commercial prospects.    On the other hand to decide not toventure in this field while America and perhaps Russia,  and Francego ahead could well mean contracting out of the large passenger air-craft business.R. A. B.Office of the First Secretary of State, S. W. 1.1st 3Hovember, 1962.-3-
annex the SUPERSONIC AIRLINERThe proposal in the United Kingdom a substantial programme of applied research was begun in 1956, co-ordinated by the supersonic transport Aircraft Committee representing the Ministry of Supply,the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, the aircraft industryand the Air Corporations.    Feasibility studies were latercommissioned from the airframe and aero-engine companies andresulted in I960 in the decision to concentrate on a long-range air-craft with twice the speed of sound for operation by the british overseas Airways Corporation on the North Atlantic.    meanwhile the French had also been carrying out research and preliminarydesign work on a medium-range aircraft with twice the speed of sound, with which they hope to follow up the Caravelle.    The FrenchGovernment have already authorised substantial funds to be committed for the development of such an aircraft.    negotiations between the United Kingdom and France brought these separateapproa.ches together and the outcome is the proposal now beforeus for an aircraft that could be produced in two versions, long-range for the London-New York run (3,250 nautical miles) and medium-range for stage lengths up to 2,400 nautical miles.    Thework of building the aircraft would be divided between UnitedKingdom and French airframe and aero-engine companies.    TheBritish Aircraft Corporation and Sud Aviation would co-operate onthe airframe;  Bristol-Siddeley and SNECMA on the engines.    the project would be controlled by a joint committee structure withequal United Kingdom and French representation, with the presidency, which would possess a casting vote, held alternatelyby the two nations.     The broad distribution of work has beenagreed.     The aim would be to get as nearly as possible a 50/50split in development, production and proceeds of sales, irrespective of whether the long-range or medium-range version gained moreorders.    On this basis Britain would have about 70 per cent of thework of developing the engine and about 40 per cent of the workof developing the airframe.The cost to public funds2.      The whole of the pre-production work (that is, development and production of two prototypes and two pre-production aircraft,all associated development work on the airframes, engines andequipment, component tests, flight development tests to fullCertificate of Airworthiness, together with the cost of jigging andtooling for production) would have to be financed by&quot;.public funds in both countries.     This has been estimated, after review of theBritish Aircraft Corporation^ figures by the Ministry of Aviation-4-
and the Treasury, at  150 million, with a margin (of error of atleast  20 m illion either way, though an increase is thought moreprobable than a reduction.     The United Kingdom and France wouldeach take half shares of this expenditure, subject to minor adjust-ment according to the actual division of work between the twocountries.     The United Kingdom share is expected to be about 1.25 million in 1962-63 rising to  8 million in 1964-65 and to a peak of some  12 million a year in the period 1966-68.     TheGovernment would seek to recover at least part of this expenditure by participating in the proceeds of sales.3.      In addition there might be some continuing expenditure forthe Government in minor developments after a full certificate of Airworthiness had been obtained.    Moreover, during the currency of the project the Government aeronautical establishmentswould continue to give it support, to an average annual value inthe United Kingdom of about  1 million.4.      While development was proceeding it would be necessary to identify the British Overseas Airways Corporation particularly with the long-range version, both to ensure the authoritativeguidance of an intending user and to encourage other airlines totake a serious interest in it.    A proposal has therefore been madeto the Corporation that they should act as if they had decidedfrom the outset to buy and operate the aircraft, includingplacing an initial order in 1964 for four-six production models.At a date to be determined, which would be about the end of 1966,the Corporation would be asked to make a firm commercialdecision.    If they rejected the aircraft, the Government wouldrelieve them of their commitments up to that date, which might beof the order of  10 million.    If, however, they confirmed theirrequirement for the aircraft, the Corporation would assume thefull financial responsibility for the order.5.      To sum up, taking a.ccou;at of paragraphs 2 and 3 above, the exchequers expenditure on launching the aircraft might be some 85 million spread over the period up to about 1970.    In the eventof the British Overseas Airways Corporation rejecting the aircraft at the end of 1966, the Government would become liable for production commitments of some  10 million, in addition to thedevelopment commitments incurred up to that date.6.      Looking further ahead, if the aircraft continues in production, in order to make possible early delivery dates itmight be necessary for the Exchequer to underwrite otherproduction in advance of orders.     This is provided for in thepolicy announced to Parliament in February, I960, but so farhas been done only for smaller and less expensive aircraft.7.      The Exchequer would be required to find the capital forany purchases by the nationalised Air Corporations which were authorised, to the extent that the Corporations&apos; revenue wasnot sufficient.     There is little reason to think that the Corporations-5-
could make any significant contribution.     Thus the cost of any-premature retirement of subsonic aircraft would fall on theExchequer, though market assumptions have throughout madeallowance for the continuing use of subsonic aircraft on  someroutes in parallel with supersonic aircraft.The market8.      The airliner would be expected to be ready to enter serviceshortly after 1970.    Bu that time most airlines that were equipped with subsonic jets between I960 and 1962 are expected to have written off their expenditure on that equipment and to be ready tore-equip, though there will be other aircraft, including theUnited Kingdom V. C. 10s. , which will have to come into serviceafter 1962 and will not be due to be written off until well after1970.     The best available evidence suggests that by 1970 traffic on routes with stage lengths over 1, 000 miles (outside Russia and china) may have grown by 120 per cent.    On the extremeassumption that supersonic replace subsonic aircraft on all these routes (including the subsonic aircraft that entered service after1962) the maximum requirement for supersonic aircraft in 1970would be some 320;  and, allowing for further growth of traffic, itwould be rather more than 400 by 1975.9.      By 1975 the United States may be entering the market withan aircraft with three times the speed of sound;  and the Americanmarket may be resistant throughout to the Anglo-French model ifa reasonable alternative is in prospect.    Discounting theAmerican market altogether and allowing for 40 per cent of otherroutes with stage lengths of over 1, 000 miles to continue with sub-sonic jets, the potential scope for the Anglo-French aircraft wouldbe about 170 (estimated value, with spares, about  1,000 million).This might be further eroded if airlines outside the Americanmarket also preferred to await an American or Russian aircraft,and because some routes include stages which could not economicallybe flown by either version of the Anglo-French aircraft.    And,finally, there is the risk that the operating costs of the supersonicairliner might prove to be such as to discourage sales.10.    In short, substantially less than 170 aircraft (estimatedvalue, with spares, about  1, 000 million) might eventually be sold;and the proceeds of these would fall to be divided between theUnited Kingdom and France.SsssMss^^ouois-ics.11.     The operating economics will depend to a considerable extent on the capital cost of the aircraft.    This has been estimatedat  3 million each for production and nearly  1 million each forpre-production costs if amortised over 170 aircraft.    If pre-production costs (which would be borne by the Exchequer, as explained in paragraph 4 above) are written off, and if develop-ment goes according to plan, it is estimated that the operatingcost per seat mile of the supersonic airliner might be rather-6-
less than that of a V. C. 10 and, except on the longest runs, rather more than that of a Boeing 707.12.    The British Overseas Airways Corporation do not think thatit would be right to base the project on the assumption that it wouldbe possible to charge higher fares for the greater speed withoutreducing demand too far.Operating requirements13.    The aircraft could use existing airports and would complywith present regulations about &quot;fly over&quot; noise.    But noise in theimmediate vicinity of the airport on take off and landing wouldbe higher than that of existing subsonic jets.    During supersonicflight,   the aircraft will create a sonic boom which could causediscomfort and annoyance to members of the public within a fewmiles of the flight path.    It is thought that this would be reducedto tolerable levels if the aircraft were restricted to subsonicspeeds up to a height of 35, 000 feet, but further study and researchis needed before any firm conclusions can be reached.    The air-craft will normally cruise at not more than 60, 000 feet, at whichheight neither passengers nor crew would probably be exposed to an unacceptable level of cosmic radiation in normal circumstances.    However, aircrew would have to be classified as&quot;radiation workers&quot; (to whom a relatively high &quot;maximum permissible level&quot; of radiation exposure is applicable) andsubjected to the appropriate safeguards;  it might be necessary togive passengers a medical check on the rare occasions when solarflares occur unexpectedly, and the aircraft cannot take avoidingaction in time.14.    These requirements tend to impair the operating economicsof the aircraft;  and the airlines might seek an indemnity against them if they purchased the aircraft at the instance of the Govern-ment.Effect on the British aircraft industry15.    The labour force of the industry stood at 308, 000 inJanuary, 1957.    In 1958 a decline in military work was forecast,but has been less than expected and in June, 1962, there were293, 000.    A decline is expected now until June, 1963, when itis estimated that the total will be about 275, 000.    What happensthere after depends on how many new projects, of which the super-sonic airliner is one (the other large ones are mainly military),are approved in the meanwhile.    The British Aircraft Corporation,who would be concerned with the airframe of the supersonic air-liner, have estimated that their labour force which stood at46, 850 at the beginning of this year would drop to about 41, 850 by theend of next year if no new projects had been approved by then.    Onthe same basis, the other major airframe group, Hawker-Siddeley,estimate that over the same period their labour force would decline from 63, 700 to 38, 000.-7-
9a16.     The picture for airframe design staff is specially-significant.    The teams of the two largest groups, the british aircraft Corporation and Hawker-Siddeley, numbered 8, 750at the end of 1961;  and 150 of those in the British Aircraft Corpora-tion were engaged on the supersonic airliner.    By the end of 1963this total would have run down to 5,100 on projects already approved,with the possibility of 2, 850 being needed for projects not yetapproved.    Of these 2, 850, 2, 000 would be on military projects:600 on the supersonic airliner.    Thus a substantial decline in design staffs will occur in any event, and will be more severe ifthe supersonic project were not approved.    At the same time,however, it is generally agreed that some rundown is appropriate and reasonable over the next few years.17.    On aero-engine design, Bristol-Siddeley have 2,800 staff at present.    This will tend to build up, mainly on militaryvertical take-off projects, and at the maximum could reach3, 200 by the end of 1963.    Rolls Royce design staff, on theother hand, which amounts to 3,500 at present, may decline,perhaps to a minimum of 2, 600 at the end of 1963 if no new projectsare approved.    The extent of the variations depends on the approvalof new projects.    But, whereas Bristol-Siddeley already haveGovernment financed work next year to the tune of  15. 6 million(with a further  3. 7 million as yet unapproved, of which  0.5 million would relate to the supersonic airliner), Rolls Royce - who are relatively far more dependent on non-Government work - haveGovernment work in 1962-63 already approved for next year and work as yet unapproved which are respectively about half Bristol-Siddeley&apos;s figures.    Forecasts of the Government-financedwork of the two concerns in 1965-66 show possible expansion in both, but relatively more in Bristol-Siddeley than in Rolls Royce,even after discounting Bristol-Siddeley&apos;s work on the supersonicairliner which would then be running at about  4 million a year.The proposals envisaged that Rolls Royce would probably have nohand in development for the supersonic airliner, partly becausethe British Aircraft Corporation favour the Bristol-Siddeleyengine, which would be a development of that used in the T.S. R. 2.and partly because the French firm that would be concerned with the engines, SNECMA, is part-owned by Pratt and Whitney who aremajor American competitors of Pvoils Royce.   It would, however, bepoaoibja to arrange for Rolls Royce to participate in the productionwork.18.    It does not appear from the figures in paragraphs 15-17that, however important in the long term, the supersonic airlineris indispensable to the life of the aircraft industry, at least in the short term;  and, distributed as is proposed, it would do little to balance the degree of Government support between the majorconcerns - rather the reverse.    On the other hand, it would fillsome awkward gaps.    Indirectly it would make it easier toprovided some continuing aircraft production work for Shorts of belfast.November, 1962-8-
