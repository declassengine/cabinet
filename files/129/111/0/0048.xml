CABINETFLUORIDATION OF WATERMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of health in July we received and published a report on a controlled experiment inartificial fluoridation of water in three &quot; study areas&quot; (Anglesey, Watford andKilmarnock) over a period of five years. This showed beyond any doubt id) thatthe addition of one part per million to the water supply drastically reduces decayin children^ teeth and (b) that it has no harmful side effects whatever on anyage-group. The Central and Scottish Health Services Councils and their StandingMedical and Standing Dental Advisory Committees have endorsed the reportwithout reservation and recommend that fluoridation be adopted.2. Fluoride is naturally present, often in quantities exceeding one part permillion, in drinking water in many places in this country (as well as elsewhere inthe world). This fact disposes effectually of any suggestion that fluoridation, whichis now widely practised in many countries, could have any harmful effect.3. The professional organisations concerned and the local authority associations have passed resolutions and sent deputations in favour of the principleof fluoridation, to which they are publicly committed. It is quite impracticable even if it were desirable for the Government either to dissent or to continuemuch longer to suspend judgment. Local authorities who wish to arrangefluoridation are pressing the Government for guidance, particularly on the legal position.4. Some doubt exists as to the power of water undertakers (whether localauthorities or not), whose statutory duty is to provide a supply of &quot; pure andwholesome &quot; water, to add any substance (even if beneficial) to water which isalready &quot; pure and wholesome &quot;. The point has not been judicially tested. (InAnglesey, Watford and Kilmarnock, fluoridation has been carried out as a researchproject and the Government indemnified the local authorities concerned, who arealso the water undertakers, against the costs of any Court action.) The EnglishLaw Officers advise that if a local authority or water undertaker were taken to court there would be an even chance that they would win. If they lost, it wouldbe on grounds which would probably also condemn the addition of other substances(to soften or harden water or to protect lead pipes) which has been long and widelypractised. The Scottish Law Officers, while more doubtful about the chances ofa favourable result in a legal action, do not think this a reason for discouragingauthorities from going ahead.5.   There are two courses open.(a) One is to announce legislation to declare fluoridation lawful. A one-clauseBill for this purpose is ready and was approved by Home AffairsCommittee and Legislation Committee.(b) It is open to local health authorities to seek approval under Section 28of the National Health Service Act, 1946, and the correspondingSection of the Scottish Act of 1947, for &quot; arrangements &quot; which wouldPrinted for the Cabinet.

secure the addition of fluoride up to one part per million to the watersupplied to their areas. The process is simple and inexpensive and thecost would rank as &quot; relevant expenditure&quot; for General Grant. Wecan therefore announce that if an authority submits such proposals,we are ready to give our approval (subject to being satisfied on details^, such as the technical arrangements to be made by the water undertaker)and that we will indemnify it (and the water undertaker, where separate)against the costs, direct or consequential, of any Court action, as we havealready been doing in relation to the &quot; study areas &quot;.6. Course (b) offers at least an even chance of avoiding legislation altogether:fluoridation continued for five years in the three &quot; study areas &quot; without anychallenge in the Courts. In the event of an action being brought and succeeding, theGovernment would have to legislate; but they would do so with the local authoritiesand the water undertakers, as well as the whole of professional opinion, entrenchedin favour. Course (b) also has the advantage that the initiative would be seen to lie with the individual local health authorities; thus it could not be represented that fluoridation was being imposed by the Government.7. Accordingly, we sought the agreement of our colleagues in the HomeAffairs Committee to course (b). The general view of the Committee was that thiscourse should be adopted, but they wished the matter to be brought to the Cabinet&apos;sknowledge.M. A. C. N.J. E. P.30th November, 1962.
