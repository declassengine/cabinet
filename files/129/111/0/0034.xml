IHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)--------&quot; ii62)^184 COPY. NO.CABINETTHE SUPERSONIC AIRLINERMeaiorandum by the Minister of aviation at their meeting on 6th November the Cabinet authorised me toinform the French Government that the proposal for the joint develop-ment of an Anglo-French supersonic airliner was in principle acceptable to the United Kingdom Government subject to assurances on certain points.     I was invited to bring the subject before the Cabinet at a later meeting, in the light cf my discussions with the French authorities(C. C. (62) 66th Conclusions, Minute 2).    I now report the outcome ofmy meeting with M. Dusseaulx, the French Minister of Transport, inParis on 8th November, with particular reference to the points mentioned in the Cabinet Conclusions.    I also attach as an Annex anote on financial participation by the United Kingdom Companies.M. Dusseaulx said that Air France would participate in the project from the outset as intending operators of the medium-rangeversion and probably of the long-range version.     Because of the relationship between this nationalised Company and the French Govern-ment, a categorical assurance could be given that at the time when theprogramme required initial production commitments to be undertaken,Air France would do what the Government wished.    The french authorities did not regard it as necessary to define in advance whether,or for how long, the Government might underwrite such commitments.M. Dusseaulx was confident that the example of Air France would befollowed in due course by other members of Air Union, who would be under strong pressure to adopt a conamon policy in regard to theintroduction of supersonic aircraft.^*    French views on the marketI found that the estimates of the market made by the french authorities were very similar to our own though both sides ax*e agreedthat no very firm assessment can be made as yet.     They put the combined requirements of Air France and the British overseas airways Corporation at 30-40 aircraft and judged that sales to otherairlines might amount to a further 120, on the assumption thatcompetition from at least one other type cf supersonic airliner hadto be faced.    (If there were no such competition, the total world market would in their opinion be about 300.)    They do not entirelyrule out the possibility of sales to American airlines, and regard
the association of Pratt and Whitney with the engine as potentiallyhelpful in this respect.    At an earlier stage there was some dis-agreement betv/een our experts and theirs as to the relative prospects of the long and medium-range versions but now that the structuraldifferences have been reduced to a minimum both sides recognise theadvantage of developing the two versions.     The future joint programmed could of course be altered at any time if it appeared that one versionwas likely to be markedly more successful than the other.4.     Name^ of^h.eaivcva.i.iThe French authorities agree that it would not be appropriate to call the Anglo-French aircraft &quot;Super-Caravelle&quot;.    A name shouldbe chosen which has the same meaning in both languages and, ifpossible, the same spelling.     The British Aircraft Corporation andSud have suggested &quot;Concorde&quot; (with and without the final &apos;e&apos;).Other possibilities might be &quot;Alliance&quot; or &quot;Europa&quot; but perhaps theCabinet may think of something better.5.    Proposed agreementWhile in Paris I discussed with M. Dusseaulx the draft of a proposed agreement between the two Governments.    A number of amendments were proposed and the resulting text appears to me to be satisfactory.    It is very similar in content to the draft discussed atan earlier stage between the then Miniates? of Aviation and hie oppositenumber in France at the time, M. Buron, a copy of which was circulated to the Committee on Civil Scientific Research andDevelopment,     It begins by saying that the two Governments haveagreed on the joint development of a civil supersonic transport air-craft, and that the basis of this collaboration is to be the equalsharing of work, cost and proceeds.     There follow clauses andannexes defining the technical proposals for the aircraft and the engine, the development programme, the industrial organisation to beset up, and the teimns of reference of the committee of officials whichwill supervise the progress of the work and report to the two Govern-ments.    All this is on the lines already reported to the Cabinet.Subject to any further amendments on points of detail (e. g. , toavoid having to make the text available to the United Nations) whichmay be suggested from either side, the next step will be for each government to signify their formal acceptance of the terms of this document in order that the development work can proceed.6.    Approval by French government. Dusseaulx informed me by telephone on 14th november that the proposals had that day been submitted by the French PrimeMinister to General de Gaulle, and had been approved,    M. Dusseaulxwas therefore ready to come over to London to sign the agreement as soon as would be convenient to us.-2-
..    . &quot; &apos; *7.     conclusion accordingly seek Cabinet authority to confirm that the UnitedKingdom Government also approve the proposed agreement and to invite M. Dusseaulxto come to London to sign it.J. A.Ministry of Aviation, W. C. 2.16th November, 1962.ANNEXFINANCIAL PART IC IP AT IONJY BRITISH MANUFACTURERS-,-;&apos;lN THE ANGLO-FRENCH SUPERSONIC AIRLINER PROJECTSince the Cabinet meeting on 6th November, I have had further discussions with the British Aircraft Corporation and Bristol SiddeleyEngines on this question.     I am not sure that the Cabinet fully appreciate the extent of the commitments the firms have already agreedto undertake towards the project, which may be summarised underfour headings:-(i) From the outset they will devote a large part of their manpower and material resources to this project to the exclusion of other possibilities, e. g. , military projects which would normally be financedon terms at least equally favourable to them.(ii) They will be responsible for all capital expenditure on buildings,plant and machinery necessary to complete the work.     In the case ofthe British Aircraft Corporation this is estimated at  2 million,(iii)    In the early stages of production of a new type costs are much higher than is eventually achieved because of the learning processesinvolved in the factories.     These &quot;education costs&quot; will inevitably bevery great in the case of the supersonic air liner.    They will be entirely the responsibility of the firms.     This expenditure forms part of the launching costs of the project and has to be recoveredgradually over sales.     The estimated effect is that the british aircraft Corporation will expend some  10 million and Bristol
Siddeley Engines some  4 million which will be recovered only after some 50 aircraft have been sold, assuming that the whole of the marginon sales is earmarked for this purpose.     Thus the two firms will be increasingly at risk from the earliest production stage.(iv)   The firms will carry the entire liability arising from their contracts with the airlines which will no doubt be on a fixed pricebasis and may also include guarantees of performance and deliverydates.    After-sales service may equally involve them in heavyliabilities.    Bearing in mind the complications arising from thesharing of costs and proceeds with the French (whose industry isnationalised) I consider that this degree of financial participation(which amounts to at least  16 million as against the estimatedGovernment contribution of  75 million) is as much as can beexpected and should provide an adequate spur to efficiency in carryingout the United Kingdom share of the work.I shall of course pursue with the French later the possibilityof each Government recovering at least part of the pre-productionexpenditure by means of levies on the proceeds of sales.Novernb e,rj/ 1 962-4-
