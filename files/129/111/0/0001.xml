ANNEX &apos;A&apos;ANALYSIS OF THE UNIONS&apos; CLAIMS-Wages Grades(a)    National Union of Railwaymen.    The Claim.The National Union of Railwaymen (N. U.R.) claim that rail-way wages should rise by at least 11. 5 per cent in order to achieve&quot;Guillebaud&quot; comparability, and probably by 12. 9 per cent.     Theirargument runs as follows:-(i)  To find out how far railway labourers&apos; pay was outof line with that in other industries, the guillebaud committee compiled three tables, each showingthe rates of pay in a number of selected industries.They took the medians of each of these threetables as at 31st December, 1959.    (See the foot-note for a definition of &quot;median&quot;).     Thesemedians were 8. 9 per cent , 10. 2 per cent and11. 3 per cent respectively above the then currentrailway rate of 156s. for a 44-hour week. *    TheCommittee concluded that the average differencebetween railway wages and wages for comparableoccupations was of the order of 10 per cent.(ii)   The industries in two of these tables were anonymous.Only those in the table where the median was. 9 per cent above the railways were named.    Theindustries in this table are commonly referred toas &quot;Appendix 9&quot; industries.     They are thoselisted in Annex &apos;B&apos;.(iii)  The median of rates paid to-day to the industries of this third table is, according to the N. U. R. ,11. 5 per cent above the railways (see N. U. R.table at Annex ,Ct).(iv)  Assuming that the medians of the two tables ofanonymous industries have risen proportionatelyto the median of the third table, the average ofthe three medians should be 12. 9 per cent abovethe current railway rate of 173s. for a 42-hour week.Footnote s; -i.    If a series of rates is arranged in either ascendingor descending order of magnitude the median is thatrate which is half way down the series.* ii.    In order to take account of variations in hours the table at Annex &apos;B&apos; shows wages reduced to the ratefor a 44-hour week in I960 and a 42-hour week in1962. i
Comment(i) In calculating the current median the N. U.R. have included in their table the rate of pay for theLocal Authorities1 labourer who is not now the lowest paid Local Authorities&apos; employee although he was the lowest at the time of Guillebaud.    Thepresent lowest paid employee gets 190s. 9d. , not196s.    If 190s. 9d. is accepted as the appropriatefigure in this case the median is 191s. 2-g-d. , not192s. lljd,     Thus, the deviation from the presentrailway rate becomes 18s. 2^d. not 19s. 11 jd, ,i.,e. , a deviation of 10. 5 per cent not 11.5 per cent.The figure of 10.1 per cent which the british transport Commission at one time mentioned inthis connection takes no account of the recent-increase to National Health Service Workers.^/(ii) Although the Guillebaud Committee agreed thatrailway wages were 10 per cent behind the averagemedian of pay in the three sets of comparableindustries they recommended a rise of only8 per cent because they said there were other conditions of service for the manual grades inwhich the railways had the advantage over outsideindustry.    True Guillebaud comparability istherefore lower than the lowest of the threemedians, not (as the N. U, R. claim) higher.In I960 it was 0. 9 per cent lower (i. e. , the lowest median was 8. 9 per cent above therailways, but they only got 8 per cent).    Onthe same basis to-day the relationship would beabout 1,1 per cent lower (i. e. , the railways are10. 5 per cent behind the median, so the correct&quot;Guillebaud&quot; rate and hence the necessaryincrease in pay to restore the correctcomparability with the &quot;Appendix 9&quot; industries would be 9.4 per cent above what they now get).If the N. U. R. interpretation of the current medianis correct, the railways are 11. 5 per cent behind the median, and the appropriate &quot;Guillebaud&quot;increase becomes 10. 3 per cent.conclusion the Wages Grades would need an increase in pay of about10 per cent to restore the same relationship to the &quot;Appendix 9&quot;industries as existed immediately following the &quot;Guillebaud&quot;increases in January, I960.
(b)   Associated Society:,of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen.JhejpiaimThe Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and firemen (A.S. L. E. F.) have claimed 7 per cent without any detailed supporting argument.     This is because they are nowclaiming only the balance of the claim for 10 per cent made inMay, 1961, which in their view, would have restored comparabilityat that date.     This claim was met only to the extent of the3 per cent award made in April, 1962.    In other v/ords their claim takes no account o  the movement in rates of pay in the&quot;Appendix 9&quot; industries since May, 1961.ConclusionTheir claim is demonstrably less than what is needed to restore true Guillebaud comparability which, as shown earlier,is about 10 per cent.jjalaried StaffWhat Guillebaud did for Salaried staff the Guillebaud Committee recommended increases in pay for railway salaried staff of 10 per cent, with higher increases incertain special cases.     They based this recommendation, liketheir recommendation of 8 per cent for wages staff, oncomparisons with the pay of certain selected outside industries.In the case of the lowest paid railway salaried staff (ClerksClass 4) there were ten such industries.    The ten were notnamed in the Guillebaud Report, but the Unions and the british transport Commission have in fact identified them.    They arelisted in Annex &apos;D&apos;.    The Guillebaud Committee said that theaverage difference between the pay of the Railway Clerk Class 4and that of outside industry, taking the medians of the differentpoints on the various scales, was about 10 per cent.    But at themaximum point the railway clerk was 13. 7 per cent out of line with the median.    So, in addition to the 10 per cent general increase, they recommended the creation of a further point onthe salary scale, making 12 points in all instead of 11 as previously, which would bring the maximum, as well as the other points, into line with the median.    (In the later negotiations between the British Transport Commission and the Unions this new maximum point was actually fixed a little above the median,but this was due to technical difficulties connected with thearranging of the scales of the various classes of clerk, and doesnot affect the general principle of comparability with themedian. )
The Unions&apos; Case(a)  National Union of RailwaymenThe claim the N. U. R, who, as well as the Transport SalariedStaffs&apos; Association (T.5.S.A, ) have salaried members, claim that the median of the current maxima of the salary scales for thesame ten industries as those chosen by Guillebaud is  655,     Thepresent maximum of the Railway Class 4 Clerk, following the3 per cent award on 1st April, 1962, is  620,    An increase of5, 65 per cent would be required to bring the Railway Class 4 Clerklevel with the median.    The N. U,R. claims an increase insalaries of this amount.JCommentThe N. U. R. assume, when they take the currentmedian as  655, that salaries in the National health service will in fact rise by not less than the 3j per cent which has been offered and is at present under considera-tion.     If this were not the case, the median would be 652 10s. Od. and the salaries of Railway ClerksClass 4 would only need to rise 5, 24 per cent to catchit up.    We may, however, accept that the median shouldbe taken as  655.ConclusionSalaries of railway salaried staff should, to restoreGuillebaud comparability, be increased by 5.65 per cent.03)   Transport Salaries Staffsf association the claim the T.S.S.A. point out that the median, at  655, is 62 10s. Od. above the median figure of  592 10s. Od. on the effective date of the Guillebaud award.     The median has in factrisen by 10.6 per cent.    The T.S.S. A. therefore say that theproper salary maximum of the Railway Class 4 Clerk should beat least 10 per cent over the maximum awarded as from4th January, I960.    This maximum was  600, so the newmaximum should be  660.    But as railway salaries have already(on 1st April, 1962) been increased by about 3 per cent, the Unionclaim the remaining 7 per cent, which would give the class 4 Clerk  40 per annum more than his present maximum of 620.
CommentThis claim argues that the percentage movement inthe median itself is the proper percentage increase forthe railways.    But it is probably more correct to regard the extent to which railway salaried staff payfalls short of the current median as the guide to theappropriate &quot;Guillebaud&quot; increase.ConclusionAs we have seen, the proper figure for a &quot;Guillebaud&quot;increase to railway salaried staff is probably 5.65 per cent on current rates not 7 per cent on the I960 rate.    The former figure would, however, give a maximum salary only  5 less than thelatter figure ( 655 as against  660).october, 1962iSSsCPtET
