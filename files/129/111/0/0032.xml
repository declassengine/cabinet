C.(62) 182 COPY NO.     &apos;13th November, 1962CABINETNEW references to THE MONOPOLIES commission memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in the course of his speech in the censure debate on 26th July, 1962,(Hansard, Col. 1765) the Prime Minister referred to a review of thelegislation relating to monopolies and restrictive practices, includingmergers.     This review is in hand:   an interim report by officials isexpected to be available before the end of the year.     It is already clearthat several difficult decisions will then have to be taken before anytbingcan be made public.     We cannot expect to announce even the outline of our future policy until the spring of 1963 at the earliest.     In the meantime,the best evidence of our continuing intention to protect the public againstabuses of commercial power in private hands must be found in the work ofthe Monopolies Commission.2.      The Commission will be reporting on electrical accessories formotor cars early next year;   on &quot;solus sites&quot; arrangements for petrolabout the end of 1963;  and on wallpaper about the middle of 1963.    If nofurther references are made fairly soon, the Government will be subjectto criticism on the grounds of being indifferent to monopolistic situationsand of letting the Commission run down.     The Chairman of theCommission has indicated privately that the Commission^ staff couldstart the preparatory examination of new references without delaying the reports on the three existing references.3.      In these circumstances, the Economic Policy Committee have examined various industries and trades which might usefully be thesubject of investigation by the Monopolies Commission, consistently withthe policy which has hitherto been followed in referring matters to them,i. e. , that we have positive reason to believe that there is somethingworth looking into.    A list of possible candidates for reference on this basis is given in Annex &apos;A*.    A further list (in Annex &apos;B&apos;) containspossible matters of reference which present some claims for attention,but in respect of which there is little or no prima facie evidence ofabuse of power or of damage to the interests of consumers or of the economy and which, accordingly, would not under the present policybe referred to the Commission.4.      There was no unanimity of opinion in the Economic PolicyCommittee about the course of action to be recommended.    some ministers felt that it would be bad timing to stimulate criticism ofthe methods of private industry in advance of a general review of our
monopoly policy, while others took the view that we ought to continueto make and be seen to make real use of the Monopolies Commission;this was the instrument designed by the Government for the protectionof the public against abuse of monopoly power and conspicuous casesought therefore to be referred to it.5.      In the discussion of particular references to be considered,the President of the Board of Trade argued in favour of selecting tiedhouses, and detergents and soaps.    Some Ministers, however, doubted,the expediency of action on tied houses now, while recognising that we might be under pressure to alter the system eventually if we enter theCommon Market.    Other Ministers questioned whether the case ofdetergents and soaps was appropriate for reference to the monopolies commission, so long as the chief complaint against the practices ofthe manufacturers was about the scale and methods of theircompetitive advertising.     In support of the President of the Board ofTrade, it was said that both matters were the subject of lively interestin the country, and that there would be general public approval of adecision to refer them to the Monopolies Commission.6.      I invite my colleagues to consider:-(a) whether we should now make further references to the monopolies Commission;   and, if so,(b) whether we should refer tied houses, and detergentsand soaps.R.M.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.13th November, 1962.
