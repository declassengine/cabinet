C. (62) 15816th October, 1962CABINETGROWTH OF OFFICES IN BIG CITIESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department in another memorandum (C. (62) 157) I have described some of the maindevelopments in location of population and employment that are foreseen by theCommittee on Population and Employment. One of these developments is the rapid growth of office employment in some of our big cities, especially London.This raises issues which, on behalf of the Committee, I now put before mycolleagues.Ministers&apos; previous studies2. When the growth of office employment was discussed in Home AffairsCommittee there was general agreement that, if the Government are to avoidjustifiable criticism, every effort must be made to check that growth in central london. The matter then went to Economic Policy Committee for considerationparticularly of specific proposals that the means of containing office developmentmight be amendment of the planning law or a tax on offices or employment in central areas. In the Economic Policy Committee, however, a minority expressedthe view that new controls were undesirable and that the problems should be tackled by means of other measures to remove the congestion. The majority view,on the other hand, was that it was right to bring the growth of office buildingunder more effective control and that there should be further study of the meansof doing so. Studies were made of the practicability of and the arguments forand against taxes on office employment and on any other possible fiscal means of checking the growth of office employment in Central London; and of the financialcost of providing transport to get people to work if employment in Londoncontinues to increase at the present rate. These studies have been considered bythe Population and Employment Committee.London in the future3. In paragraph 14 of the interim report on the Committee&apos;s work(C. (62) 157) there is a sketch of the situation in London as we think it would be between now and 1980 if present population and employment trends continue:THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.

shortage of land for housing; high land values on each side of the Green Belt;intensified pressure for modification of the Green Belt; the number of London&apos;shomeless growing as the prosperity of their city increases; relief by overspill schemesnullified by the increase in jobs, with no possibility of a corresponding increase in housing at the centre; congestion spreading to dormitory towns beyond the GreenBelt; high cost of travel to work and congestion of the transport system which wouldbe soluble only by major new capital works.4. In theory, if it became more and more expensive to obtain labour in the-centre and to live by commuting to work there, the point should come where itIwould not be worth while either for managements or for labour that employment should grow further in the centre. Similarly, if, short of this point being reached,the transport system had to be modified and expanded, any consequent increasein fares to defray the cost should also reduce the workers&apos; willingness to commuteand increase the managements&apos; willingness to locate their offices in outer areas;and this would be only one specific instance of the tendency of high costs to dampdown demand for offices in the centre. In due course, presumably, such influenceswould take effect in any case. Would things work out satisfactorily like this,socially and economically?   What would happen in the meantime?The issues  or decision5. The question, then, which has been before us is whether, and if so how,we should do anything in advance of the operation of the market, or to reinforceit. We all reject building licensing as undesirable, and control of offices on thelines of the Industrial Development Certificate as impracticable. We all favourintensifying dispersal of Government offices and encouraging by a special agency,which would co-operate with local authorities and the business world, the use of offices outside central areas. We are agreed on the need to explore new ways of promoting staggered hours. As for the influence of the Green Belt, this is something which we shall be considering further.6. But on two proposals we are divided; and the decisions upon them, one way or the other, will be important. They are a proposal to remove or curtail ameasure of latitude in present planning controls of office building and a proposalto tax employment or offices in central areas. Should we be doing, or appear tobe doing, too little if we did not adopt one or both of these proposals? Or too much if we adopted either or both of them?Amendment of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, Third Schedule7. The former entails amending the Third Schedule to the Town and country planning Act, 1947, which gives owners of existing office property a notional rightto extend the cubic space by 10 per cent, on redevelopment if desired, with a claimto compensation if permission is refused. Because of the very heavy risk ofcompensation, no local planning authority dare refuse at present; yet modernmethods of construction and reduction of ceiling heights turn 10 per cent, extra incubic space into an addition of up to 40 per cent, in persons employed. Theamendment would remove any right to compensation if, on future applications forredeveloping existing office space, permission to increase existing floor space bymore than 10 per cent, were refused. The implications of the proposed amendmentare set out in Annex A.A tax on offices8. The other proposal, for a levy on offices, might take several forms. these have been analysed by a working party whose views are summarised in Annex B.The effective choice is between a capitation tax on all employment in central london, an annual tax on the occupation of office space there, and a once-for-alltax on net additions to office space in new buildings there. Of these three, the tax on employment would be the best economically, but would involve administrative difficulties, especially if exemptions were admitted, for which there would be strongsocial and political arguments. It would also arouse the most widespreadopposition, unless the exemptions were extensive. The taxes on office occupation and on new office building should not be particularly difficult to administer,whether by central or local government, though the need to distinguish between
office and other use could be troublesome. Of these two, the tax on officeoccupation would be preferable economically, and more effective in reducing thegeneral demand for offices in Central London. But, because it would be more effective, it would correspondingly arouse more opposition than the tax on new building only, though some of this might be mitigated by refinements, such asexemptions or reliefs for offices with small staffs.The impact9. The amendment of the planning law would not touch 10 million square feet of new office building, providing three or four years&apos; work ahead, for which planning permission has already been granted; but it would bite on any futureapplications to redevelop the 66 million square feet of existing pre-war office space.The levy proposal, on the other hand, would exert its influence immediately, bothon new building and on the users of existing buildings.The majority view10. In the view of the majority, we cannot afford, socially and economically,to go on as we are doing now in Central London. If we do there will be severehousing shortages and pressures, very serious transport congestion, soaring land and business costs and in the end we shall be driven into big expenditures ofpublic money and the sacrifice of living conditions. In the opinion of most of usthis is not a situation which should be accepted.11. It need not happen if effective measures are taken now to deal with theoffice problem which is at the heart of this situation. If a grip is taken on that now,much can be done to improve the situation in terms of congestion and housing.We shall need more offices; but the aim should be to get a better spread overLondon as a whole and beyond, with less at the centre. To do this it is essentialto make the central area less attractive to Office developers and occupiers. Thebest way of doing this is by adopting the proposals for a tax on offices and an amendment to the Third Schedule, together with the other ancillary measures. a tax can be devised which is both practical and effective. Physical planning controlsby themselves are not enough and extreme forms of control are undesirable.12. In the opinion of most of us it would be wrong and unrealistic to do nothing, on the basis that if things get really bad the situation will right itself;there is no reason for thinking that the experience of the last ten years will not be repeated (with more serious consequences) over the next ten. Moreover, a deliberateand negative decision of this kind would be likely to be extremely unpopular andthe process of adjustment extremely painful.13. The commercial efficiency of London will not be damaged by theseproposals. A lot of routine work in big London offices can be done just as efficiently and a good deal more cheaply outside the central area, leaving room there for thosewho have to be close in.The minority views14. In the opinion of the minority of the Committee, the proposed specialforms of Government intervention (and especially the proposals for new taxes onoffices) are unnecessary. Many of the social problems, it is said, are the inevitable result of the growing prosperity and are tolerated as a price of it. The working of ordinary economic forces will set a limit to the growth of office employment in central London, and the boom will break.15. The particular measures are held to be undesirable because they would put further burdens and restraints on business expansion; concentrated upon offices,they would discriminate against London&apos;s commercial enterprise in favour of other activities which create employment and congestion in Central London, such ascinemas, bingo halls, restaurants, multiple stores. It would be untimely to add afurther tax to the duties imposed on office employers by the forthcoming Offices,Shops and Railway Premises Bill.16. This body of opinion, moreover, doubts the efficacy of the tax measures,unless the rates of tax were so heavy as to be virtually prohibitive on new office
building. If the tax were only a minor addition to&apos; office costs, there would be noreason to suppose that it would impose any greater deterrent than the increases in costs that have already taken place and that would be expected to happen inthe ordinary course.17. Objections in principle have been advanced against amendment of theThird Schedule as amounting to confiscation of part of the value of certain property.The contrary view has been expressed, however, that it would be preferable to take an even tougher line on planning (i.e., cancelling without compensation approvalsfor re-development which have already been issued), rather than to use the fiscalmethod of discouraging office building.Conclusion18. We have now been considering this matter in various ministerial committees for over two years. Criticism of the position in London is growing;the Minister of Housing faces pointed attacks over London&apos;s congestion (particularlyhomelessness) and unless he can state how the Government will deal with these problems as soon as Parliament reassembles we shall lose ground. We therefore ask the Cabinet to decide:(i) Whether to invite the Chancellor of the Exchequer to give furtherconsideration to the idea of a levy on offices in central areas of Londonand possibly of other large cities.(ii) Whether to invite the Minister of Housing, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Scotland, to bring forward detailed proposals for amending the Third Schedule to the Town and Country planning act, 1947.H. B.Home Office, S.W.1,15th October, 1962.Annex ATHE THIRD SCHEDULE TO THE TOWN AND COUNTRY planning act, 1947The effect of the Third Schedule is that a property owner can expect to add10 per cent, to the cube of his building on redevelopment. This allows an increasein floor space of as much as 40 per cent. There is still some 66 million square feet of pre-war office building and if only half were redeveloped with a 40 per cent,increase in floor area the additional space would amount to some 13 million square feet, i.e., about half the total increase in the last nine years. But if the local planning authority tries to hold the amount of floor space on redevelopment to that of theexisting building the chances are that the owner can establish a claim for compensation. In the case of a valuable central site, the potential liability is soheavy as to inhibit the London County Council from taking effective planningaction.2. The London County Council (as well as the Conservative Policy Committeeon Planning and the Town and Country Planning Association) are in favour of amending the Third Schedule. This would require legislation, the basis of whichwould be to provide that local planning authorities might, without fear ofcompensation, refuse permission for rebuilding which involved an addition to theoffice floor space in the existing building (with or without a 10 per cent, tolerance).This would not mean that sites would be under-developed: there would be cases in which it would be in the public interest to allow more office space than there isnow and in addition there could be more mixed development, with the extra bulkin the form of fiats.
TOP SECRET53. The obstacle to an amendment is the argument that compensation shouldbe paid to owners affected by it. The Schedule has been par,t of the legislationsince 1947: statements about rights were made at that time and land transactionssince then have taken place on the basis that redevelopment rights included theexisting cube plus 10 per cent. Moreover the value of these rights was excludedfrom the claims made under Part VI of the 1947 Act for loss of development value.There would undoubtedly be criticism from property owners-not all of themspeculators who would feel that legitimate rights had been confiscated ifcompensation were not paid. Compensation for the abolition of the rights hasbeen estimated to be likely to cost about  75 million if paid in a lump sum.4.   Arguments on the other side are:(i) The right to compensation is not clear and explicit and there is no certainty that a claim can be successfully established in every case.(ii) There is a provision in the Act under which the Minister of Housing mayrule out compensation in particular cases. It has never been used butit does mean that an owner cannot say that his right is unqualified.(iii) Parliament did not intend in 1947 to confer such generous rights to add to existing floor space. In other fields of legislation there would be no hesitation in correcting an anomaly which unexpectedly and undulyfavoured the individual at the public expense.(iv) If this is the right remedy for the problems of congestion in London itshould not be set aside merely because it might reduce the profit accruingon redevelopment to owners of office sites; there is now general acceptance of the need for severe restrictions on development of landwhere vital planning objectives are at stake.11th October, 1962.Annex BCONCLUSIONS OF A REPORT BY OFFICIALS ONFISCAL MEASURESA Working Party of officials were instructed to examine the possibility of taxes on office employment or on new office building or any other fiscal means of checking the growth of office building in Central London. They considered acapitation tax, either on employment generally or on office employment, an annualtax on occupation of buildings generally, or of office buildings, and a once-for-alltax on new office buildings.  The main conclusions were as follows:(i) A general capitation tax on all employment in Central London wouldstrike directly at the root of the problem, namely, the number of peopleemployed there. It would be in accord with economic desiderata in leaving the price mechanism to determine the most profitable uses of space in Central London and in prompting existing occupiers to reconsider their position and perhaps to move out, leaving room for more profitable activities. It would be difficult to administer: new machinery of returns and inspections would be needed, there would beproblems of applicability in regard to peripatetic workers and the like,and there would be pressure for exemptions, which if conceded wouldinvolve further problems of definition and equity and administrativecomplication. Some, though not all, of these difficulties could be avoided by a general exemption for the first (say) 25 of an undertaking^employees.(ii) Although the strictly economic arguments are against any discrimination against office employment or office building, and this is an objection to
all the forms of tax considered except the general employment tax,there are social and political arguments for discrimination againstoffices. Moreover, the growth of office employment does account forthe major part of the growth of employment in the central area.(hi) A capitation tax on office employment alone, with a general exception for small offices, would avoid some of the difficulties of a generalemployment tax. But it would seem illogical, for each and every person causes congestion in the same degree, whether employed in an office or not; there would be problems of definition of office workers;and there would be the same problems about peripatetic workers, etc.New machinery of administration would again be required.(iv) An annual tax on occupation of offices would have an impact on totalemployment only by discouraging new additional office building; but,after a time, it would effectively do this by generally weakening thedemand. It would have the economic merit of directly and immediatelyprompting existing occupiers to consider moving all or part of their offices out of London. There would be problems of definition and ofexemptions, which might be mitigated by a general exemption for smalloffices. Such a tax might be administered either by the Inland Revenueor by local authorities; in either case there are practical problems which would require further consideration after a decision in principlehad been taken to introduce a tax of this type.(v) A once-for-all tax on net additions to office space in new buildings wouldbe simpler to administer. It would not strike immediately at existingoccupiers, but in the long run, after a delay varying according to theterms of existing leases, it would drive up the rents of existing office buildings. There could be no provision for exemptions, and theadditional revenue would go to the landlords of existing buildingsrather than to the Exchequer.(vi) Whether for an employment tax or for a tax on buildings it would bedifficult to choose an appropriate rate of tax; so that powers to vary the rate in the light of experience would be desirable. It might alsobe desirable to take power to impose the tax at a reduced rate in anouter zone.(vii) Any of these taxes would be unpopular with those to whom it applied.The more effective the tax, the more unpopular it would be, and themore general the tax, and hence the better economically, the more widespread the unpopularity.11th October, 1962.
