(fHIS DOCUMENT IS.THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(62) 19223rd november^ej^B^962COPY NO.CABINETINDUSTRIAL TRAININGMemorandum by the Minister of labour with the approval of the Economic Policy Committee I haveopened discussions with the British Employers&apos; Confederation (B. E. C. )and the Trades Union Congress (T. U. C. ) on proposals for improvingindustrial training arrangements.     I have also kept the nationalised industries informed.2. The immediate reaction both of the B. E, C. and the T, U. C.was generally favourable. The proposals are now to be studied by both bodies with a view to detailed dicsussion with my Department.3.      There is widespread interest in this whole question ofindustrial training and it is important in my view that Parliament andthe public should know the nature of the proposals which are underdiscussion.    It was for this reason that I proposed, and the economic policy Committee agreed, that a White Paper should be issued at anearly date.     I informed both the B. E. C. and the T. U. C. when I sawthem on 21st November that I proposed to take this step and there wasno dissent.4.      I am circulating herewith, as requested by the economic policy Committee, the draft of a White Paper which I would proposeto issue if my colleagues agree.J.H.Ministry of Labour, S. W. 1.23rd November, 1962
DRAFT   W H IT E   PAPERINDUSTRIAL TRAINING-I.     THE CASE FOR ACTION1,     Ever since the war industry in this country has been short of skilled labour.   This has usually been the case even in&apos; those partof the country where the general demand for labour has beenrelatively low.   There is no doubt that shortages of skilled man-power have been an important factor in holding back the rate ofeconomic expansion of which, as a country, we were capable - not least in those parts of the country where such expansion would havdone&apos; most to reduce the higher than average level of generalunemployment.2.     The G-overnment has pledged itself to a policy of securing a steadier and more rapid rate of economic growth,&apos; and the implications of this decision are at present being studied by theNational Economic Development Council.   On the success of thispolicy will depend the country1s ability to increase its living standards, the pace at which such desirable social objectives asthe building of new hospitals, slum clearance and educationalexpension can proceed, and our ability to play a proper role in world affairs.   But it will be impossible to make a successof this policy unless the skilled manpower is available to put it into effect.    This means that the rate of industrial trainingmust be increased,3,     But an increase in the supply of skilled labour will need to he matched by an imnrovement in its quality.   Whether or not we decide to join   the Common Market our exports are going to be faced with increasing competition.    The standard of training inthis country at its best is high;   unfortunately this is by no means universal.     Much of it is barely adequate and someis definitely unsatisfactory.     Many firms do not make adequate use of the facilities for technical education.Our overseas competitors, particularly in Western european countries, have paid great attention to the need to maintain/ an
an adequate supply of well trained skilled labour.    We must be  . .quite sure that our own arrangements do not fall behind,,4,     At present training for industry in this country is primarilythe responsibility of individual firms, though the Government;Local Education Authorities, and other agencies such as the city and Guilds of London Institute are contributing to it,&apos; TheIndustrial Training Council which was set up in 1958 hy the british employers&apos; Confederation, the Trades Union Congress and the nationalised industries to provide encouragement and help to industries in dealing with the training of workpeople, has helped to stimulate interest in the question.     In recent years many firms have taken advantage of the rise in the number of school leaversby increasing substantially their recruitment of apprentices,,    In1961 there was an increase in the number of apprentices-recruited over !-the previous year of 12,321 (or 10$) and in the first ten months of1962 there was a further increase of 10,989 (or 9$) over thecorresponding period of 19611    These increases basro been very welcome.Even so, it remains doubtful whether the number of new entrants intoskilled occupations is going to be sufficient to match the country&apos;future needs.    The experience of industry in the United States, forexample, suggests that technological progress requires an increasing proportion of trained and technical manpower in the working population,with a correspondingly smaller demand for unskilled and semi-skilled labour.    In this country the great majority of unfilled vacanciescall for some degree of skill, while a high proportion of the adultunemployed are labourers.   The moral is surely obvious,5o     A serious weakness in our present arrangements is that theyleave the amount and quality of industrial training to the unco-ordinateddecisions of a large number of individual firms.    These may lack thenecessary economic incentive to invest in training people who, oncetrained, may leave them for other jobs.   While the benefits of train-ing are shared by all firms in industry its cost is borne only by those firms which decide to undertake training themselves,6,     That these weaknesses exist, and must be remedied, is/increasingly
increasingly accepted within industry itself.    The Government has there fore decided that the time has come to strengthen and improve the existing partnership between industry, the Government and theeducation authorities in the provision of industrial training,    It -has accordingly begun discussions with representatives of employers&apos;and workers&apos; organisations on proposals for improving the present arrangements.    Discussions are also being arranged with theappropriate representative bodies in the educational worlds7.     The objectives to be achieved can be stated as followsg-(i)   to enable decisions on the scale of training to be betterrelated to the needs of the economy and to technologicaldevelopments!(ii)   to improve the overall quality of industrial training and to establish minimum standards5and(iii)   to enable the cost of training to be more equitably spread,8,     So that discussions on how to achieve these objectives may takeplace on 3. realistic basis the Government has drawn up proposalswhich are set out in the paragraphs which follow.    They have been drawn up after a study of existing practices both in this countryand abroad,II,    THE GOVERNMENT&apos;S PROPOSALSA Training bill.     The Minister of Labour would bo given statutory power to setup Boards to be responsible for all aspects of industrial trainingin individual industries,,   The Minister would be required to consulttho organisations principally concerned on both sides of theindustry before setting up a Board,10,    The range of functions which the Boards would be empoweredto undertake would be set out in the proposed Bill,    These mightincludes-(1)   Establishing policy governing training in the industry,including such questions as admission to training(whether apprenticeship or otherwise), length of/training
training, registration of trainees, and a provisionfor appropriate attendance at colleges of further education.(2)   Establishing standards of training and syllabusesfor different occupations in the industry; taking intoaccount the associated technical education required,(3)   Providing advice and assistance about training to firms in the industry,(4.)   Devising   tests to be taken by apprentices and othertrainees on completion of training and, if necessary,at intermediate stages - e. g.the end of the first year.(5)   Establishing qualifications and tests for instructorsresponsible for training,(6)   Establishing and running training courses in its owntraining centres,(7)   Paying grants to firms to reimburse them all or part ofthe costs incurred by them in the provision of approved training,(8)   Paying allowances to trainees not taken on by firmswhile being trained in public, or the Board&apos;s own,centres.(9)    Collecting money from establishments in the industry by means of a levy,(lO)   Borrowing money,IT,   A levy on firms in the industry, is an essential part ofthe proposals.   If a Board undertook the functions set out at(6),  (7) and (8) above it would incur considerable expense,The Bill would provide that rebates could be allowed from the levy where firms were providing industrial training of approvedquality.    Whether or not this should be done would be a matter/for 
exclude firms belo?; a certain size from the levy.    In addition,the G-overnmeht would propose that the Bill should empower theMinister of Labour to make loans or grants to the Boards12.The Bill would provide that the Minister of Labour, atthe request of a Board, could undertake the duty of identifying,subject to appeal, the establishments comprised within the definition of the industry.   It would give the necessary powersto obtain information for this purpose, e.g, as to numbers employed and types of work undertaken in establishments,13.     The Boards would be empowered to appoint qualified persons to undertake duties in connection with the promotion ofindustrial training including making reports on the quality oftraining provided by firms applying for grants.   The Ministerof Labour vrould be empowered to appoint officers to satisfyhim that the standards of training adopted by the Board weresufficient to justify payment of grant to the Board by theMinister,,The kind of scheme^ which might be operated by the Boards^14*   Legislation on these lines would leave latitude to the boards in deciding on their activities within the range of functions set out in paragraph 10,     It might well be, however,that some Boards would find that particularly in dealing withapprenticeship trades they could best make progress by concentratingtheir main attention - at any rate in the first place - on theimprovement of first-year training.    This view is based on theexperience of firms which have their own training schools andon the success achieved by the Ministry of Labour and manyeducation authorities in the last two or three years in trainingfirst-year apprentices on a full-time basis in both government training Centres and Technical Colleges,15*     Experience has clearly shown that if young people on leaving school are given a systematic.course of training in the5(TO M Pi O F M TO A L
basic principles of their trade, their progress thereafter to full skill will be more rapid and their adaptability, within their trade much greater than if they started out on a narrow range ofproduction work.    It is particularly difficult for many employers,particularly the small and medium-sized employer, to make available the machinery and instructors to give the apprentice thissystematic grounding in his tra.de in his first year.   The Widerprovision of opportunities for systematic training in the first-year of apprenticeship would do much to improve our whole systemof training by remedying it at its weakest point, namely, thehaphazard and narrow training all too often given at the beginningof apprenticeship.16,     If a Board decided to concentrate on first-year trainingit might find it desirable to provide that the cost, includingperhaps wages, of all first year industrial training should beborne by the Board.   The actual arrangements for training would no doubt vary according to the circumstances of the industry t.ndthe area, but the powers set out in para. 10 above would enable theBoard to make any arrangements which might be necessary,17.     Clearly a Board which took over responsibility for first-year training on these lines, would also, find it necessary tocarry out some of the other functions set out in paragraph 10above, e.g. establishing standards of apprenticeship training.Definition of Industries18.     The definition of industries for inclusion in the Orderssetting up Boards would have to be worked out in detailed dis-cussions with those concerned in the industries affected.Composition of the Boards19.     The composition of the Board would be a matter for consultationwith the industry concerned in the ce.se of each scheme.   How far it would be necessary to lay down a general pattern In the bill would be for consideration.   It would seem clear that the major part of the representation would have to be provided by employersc /and.
7CONFIDENTIALand trade unions;    that representation of GovernmentDepartments would be necessary;    and, in view of the, close links between industrial training and education, that there shouldhe appropriate educational representation also.
