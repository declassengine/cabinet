Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1962C. (62) 18722nd November, 1962CABINETPOST OFFICE FINANCE AND prices memorandum by the Postmaster-general in agreement with Treasury Ministers the financial target of the Post office for 1963-64 is to secure a return of 8 per cent, on net assets and so justify its large capital investment in accordance with the policy for nationalised industries setout in the White Paper on &quot;The Financial and Economic Obligations of the nationalised Industries &quot; (Cmnd. 1337).2. The return on capital was 8 per cent, or more in the three years prior to1961-62. Subsequently the finances of the Post Office have been adversely affectedby the higher level of wage awards after arbitration and by the general state ofbusiness. In consequence the return last year was 6 - 5 per cent, and this year it islikely to be less. For 1963-64 the return on capital may fall to about 6 per cent.An additional profit of about  25 million may be needed to increase the return to per cent.3. Relatively small cuts in current expenditure would involve poorer serviceswhile reductions in capital investment are economically undesirable andimpracticable on any scale. In agreement with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, Ipropose with reluctance to increase prices to raise nearly  24 million in a full year. A list of the proposed increases is given at Annex A. They will not be popular but at least they avoid increasing the 3d. post and telephone rentals whichare the most politically sensitive spots. They include the attraction of relaxing the timing of local telephone calls.4. If my colleagues agree to these proposals I should propose to announcethem in early December and to make them effective in the early part of the newyear.  I attach a draft Statement at Annex B.J. R.

In consequence, the return onnet assets threatens to fall below 6^ per cent, this year and 6 per cent, next year.As the House knows, the intention is that the net capital expenditure of the PostOffice on fixed assets should rise from  105 million in 1960-61 to about  150 million in 1963-64.  Investment on this scale is essential in order to give improved public
services, notably a speedier telephone service, especially on trunks, a reductionin the telephone waiting list, and improvements in postal services. On any view it is undesirable to cut back this capital investment.In order that the Post Office with its substantial requirements for development should continue to pay its way properly, I have to consider tariff increases calculated to increase income next year by about 4 per cent. Some  15 million will come fromtelecommunications and  8 million from posts.It has not been easy to choose which tariffs should be increased and in thisI have been guided not only by economic but by social considerations.The principal changes I propose to make are:Telecommunications(a) The unit charge for STD calls will be increased from 2d. to 3d., but thetime allowed for each unit charge will be increased for both local andtrunk calls. For STD local calls the time for each unit charge willbe increased from 3 to 9 minutes in the full-rate period and from12 to 15 minutes in the cheap-rate period. The introduction of theseextended times depends on modifications to equipment which cannotbe made until 1st April, 1963; meanwhile, the time allowed for thenew unit charge will be increased from 3 to 6 minutes in the full-rateperiod. .:(b) For non-STD calls the local call fee will be increased by ^d. and certaintrunk call charge steps will be increased by 3d. to 9d. for 3 minutes.(c) The charge for inland telegrams will be increased from 3d. to 5d. a word.The charges for certain overseas telegrams will also be increased.Posts(d) Charges for inland parcels will be increased on average by about 6d. aparcel, and those for overseas parcels, which vary according todestination, raised to bring them more nearly into line with costs.At the same time, in order to attract new business, the weight limit for inland parcels will be raised from 15 to 22 lb. To prevent thetransfer of packages from the parcel to the letter post, increases willbe made in the charges for inland letter packets weighing morethan \\ lb.(e) The charge for registration will be increased by 3d.; in the inland service this should have the effect of diverting more traffic to the cheaperRecorded Delivery Service, the growth of which I am anxious toencourage.(/) Charges for overseas printed papers, which are incurring a heavy loss,will also be raised.(g) The rates for inland money orders and the related cash on delivery chargeswill be increased by Is. at each step to reduce substantially the loss on these services.With a view to attracting profitable business, I have decided to introduce ahousehold delivery service for the delivery of unaddressed circulars and sampleson a door-to-door basis.Details of the changes will be published in the Official Report. Most of them will operate as from 7th January, 1963.November 1962.
