 ,.(621209 C OPY NO.31st December, 1962CABINETNATlONAj^I^URANCE AND OTHER benefits memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Cabinet have agreed that legislation shall be introduced during the current session to increase national insurance and related rates of benefit and that national assistance rates shouldalso be increased (C. C. (62) 68th Conclusions, Minute 5).     ThePrime Minister set up a Committee of Ministers, with myself inthe Chair, to examine the case for differential rates of benefit and other questions referred to in C. (62) 177 and to bring thematter before the Cabinet at a later meeting.    I do so on behalfof the Committee in this memorandum.The background.     My Committee have taken account of three special factors:-(a)   There has for some time been pressure from varioussources for differential benefits, and we have said      /as long ago as October, 1961, that we are examiningthis.. (b)    There is need to increase unemployment benefit asunemployment rises to a peak in the early monthsof 1963.(c)   A Private Member&apos;s Bill to give effect to theOpposition^ promise to double the 10s. widow&apos;pension and to abolish the earnings rules appliedto widowed mothers&apos; allowances and widows1pensions will come up for Second Reading on25th January.51kg, alternative course s3.      We have considered and rejected a number of possible courses.    We are left with two alternatives;  we are not agreedupon which is to be preferred.4.      One course would be as simple a Bill as possible, providing  -for a flat increase of 7s. 6d. a week in the single rate of benefit under the national insurance scheme, and (subject to discussion between the Minister of Pensions and myself on the exact amounts)corresponding flat-rate increases in the other national insurance ratesand in those under the industrial injuries and war pensions-1-S EC RET
scfc.em.es.     The National Assistance Board could be expected torecommend an increase in the national assistance scale rates ofabout 4s. (for the single householder) which, together with theincrease of last September, would amount to an increase of 8s.in all.5.      The alternative would be a Bill providing for an increaseof 6s. a week in the single national insurance benefit for all thosewho are unemployed, sick or pensioners aged less than 70 years,and 12s. 6d. a week for those aged 70 years or more(the increases under the industrial injuries and war pensions schemes wouldrequix*e further consideration).    It might also be desirable for theBill to provide for the introduction of a similar differential in the scales of national aesie-fcance - although this could be done by regula-tions - also effective at age 70, the exact amounts of the revisedrates to be determined subsequently in the normal way uponrecommendations of the National Assistance Board,    Such a differential would involve a lower increase for those aged lessthan 70 than would otherwise be appropriate.Provisiong^ common tojjc^h^alterjiative s6.      Whichever&apos; of the two alternatives is adopted, theCommittee are agreed that provision should be included also forthe following:-(a) The increases in unemployment, sickness and maternitybenefits under the National Insurance Scheme, ininjury benefit and unemployability supplement and additional treatment allowance, should all be paid from the earliest practicable dates, which would fall in the first half of March, even though it willnot be practicable to bring into payment the increases in other benefits, including retirement pensions or national assistance, until a few months later on.(b) Contributions would not be increased until after mostof the benefits were increased, so that increasedrates of certain benefits, particularly unemploy-ment and sickness benefit, would have been in payment for some months before contributionsrose.     This would be consistent with thereflationary measures which we are adoptingfor the immediate future.(c) The abolition of the widowed mothers&apos; earning rule,.proposed in Mr, Bipton&apos;s Bill, should be resisted.It would cost  ljr million a year, would benefitwidowed mothers who are already reasonably welloff and would almost certainly lead to the abolitionof the earnings rule for widows&apos; pensions andprobably for retirement pension itself.    Instead,the following improvements in respect of widowed mothers would be introduced.
(i)   Widowed mothers&apos; earnings up to  6 a week (insteadof  5 as at present) should be disregarded incompLiting their allowances.     (Draft regulations for this have already been put to the national assistance Advisory Committee and published. )(ii)   The allowances in respect of children of widowed mothers should be increased by more than thecorresponding provision for.children of parentsreceiving unemployment or sickliess benefit.(iii)    The earnings rule applied in computing widowed mothers&apos; allowances should be modified by theBill so that in addition to her children&apos;allowances the widow should ad ways have about25s. a week of her own allowance free of the earnings rule.     This would replace the ruleunder which the whole of her own allowance -except 10s. in the case of a widowed motherfrom the pre-1948 scheme - is subject to the earnings rule.The argument s for the simple^fjha^t^aj^^^crea^^7. Those in the Committee who favour the simple flat-rateincrease do so for the following main reasons:-(a)    The interest which has been displayed in recentyears in differential benefits may be overlaid tosome extent in the immediate future by concern about the unemployed.    Speed might be a greatervirtue than development of the national insurancesystem at this stage.(b)    Vvlth unemployment rising, the public may be more concerned with the sharp drop in the standard ofliving of a man who loses his job than with the prolonged erosion of the resources of the aged.There may be a case for some differential orgraduated unemployment benefit varying with thetime for which the recipient has been out of work.This has not been fully examined, and should beconsidered along with any other proposed differentialbenefits;  but the examination would take time.Meanwhile, it may be best in the present situation to give the maximum possible increase all round -to the unemployed, the sick and the younger pensioneras well as to the older pensioner - rather than togive less to those classes in order to give more tothe over-70s.
(c) The pressure for differential benefit, though real, maynot have been fully thought out.    It is not clear, forinstance, how far its advocates want greaterselectivity as a means of transferring people fromreliance upon national assistance to reliance uponnational insurance, or how far they want it as a means of directing benefit to some group withparticular need, instead of distributing it generally.We ourselves may want, in the light of our ownstudies, to develop the system in one such directionrather than another, and we cannot be sure at thisstage that by adopting differential benefit for the over-70s we might not be putting an obstacle in the path that we should want to follow.(d) Differential benefit for the over-70s would not beuniversally welcomed.     It might be resented by theunemployed, the chronic sick, retirement pensionersunder 70, particularly those in ill health, those tooold to have become insured in 1948 (who are now well over 70 years of age) and women (who would receivethe lower rate of retirement pension for as long asten years from age 60 to age 70).    It might indeedprove impossible to limit the differential to retire-ment pensioners over 70, but there are serious difficulties involved in extending it further.(e) The Committee agree that it would not be practicable to recognise that the over-70s have aspecial claim to extra benefit under national insurancewithout at the same time recognising the same claim under national assistance,.    On the other hand, if acorresponding benefit were introduced in the national assistance scales, this would defeat what might beregarded as one of the objects of a national insurancedifferential for the over-70s, namely to take many ofthe older pensioners off national assistance.(f) It would also be open to formidable objections from thepoint of view of national assistance principles.    Thepurpose of national assistance is to meet need on an individual basis:  where the old or any others, suchas the chronic sick,have special needs these are met by discretionary payments supplementing the scalerates.     To introduce a new conception, of a higher standard of need in favour of a whole group irrespective of individual need would undermine this principle and inevitably lead to pressure from other groups wherehardship was no less and possibly greater.    it certainly cannot be said that the needs of a hale man of 70 are as great as those of a chronic invalidunder 70.4-SSCKET
(g)  The administrative complexities in introducingdifferential benefit for  the over-70s would delay the payment of new rates of national insurance retirement pension and widows&apos; benefits from theend of May to the second week in July.    It wouldnot be practicable to pay the lower rate as fromthe end of May and to add the differential as from july.The arguments for ,^^J^S^iS^h^Si^Ll2E^kS^^S Jz3^8, Those membersof th&amp; Committee who favour the differentialbenefit do so for the following main reasons:-(a) There is widespread criticism among both supporters of the Government and others of the non-selectivenature of the overall non-discriminating increases in national insurance benefits.    In October, 1961,at the Conservative Party Conference at Brighton,the motion advocating selectivity in the case of future changes was accepted by the then Minister ofPensions and National Insurance,    It has been theunderstanding of those Government supporters in theHouse who concern themselves with these matters that a close study was being given to measures tomake national insurance more discriminating inrespect of future increases.(b) There is merit in the view that old age as suchjustifies additional benefit, both generally and for specific reasons, for instance that in old ageresources have frequently been eroded, healthmay be imposing extra burdens and household goods and clothes may need replacement.     TheCommittee on Economic and Financial Problemsof the Provision for Old Age, under the Chairman-ship of Sir Thomas Phillips, can be quoted in general support of the view that benefit should be concentrated on those over 70.(c) There is a large group of old people whose standard of life has fallen heavily since they were at work andwho yet, being still above national assistancestandards, cannot be benefited by national assistance.(d) Publication of &quot;The Economic Circumstances of old people&quot; by Dorothy Cole and J.E. G. Utting hasstimulated sympathy for the aged, with theimpression that is given that there are up to halfa million old people who are living at or belowthe poverty line but are unwilling to apply for national assistance.-5-
(e)   The principle of differential &quot;benefit has been recognised in war pensions, where widows receive 10s. a weekextra at age 70 and the full basic rate for war pensioners is raised by up to 15s. a week for theseverely disabled on reaching age 65j  in national insurance itself, where larger allowances are paidin respect of widowed mothers1 children than ofchildren of parents receiving other forms ofbenefit;  and in our recent Pensions Increase Act,1962, which gave additional increases to publicservice pensioners over 70 and which was very well received.9.      Even if we decide to introduce differentials for the over-70sat this stage we can see no escape from some form of public inquiry, if only to focus attention on the merits of, and arguments for and against, differential benefit for the newly unemployed;and we shall need our own private inquiry for the determination of our long-term policy on national insurance and assistance.These, however, are matters to which the Committee will be giving further thought.Cost10.    The scheme of flat-rate increases would cost the national insurance Funds  158 million a year, towards which the exchequer would contribute  22 million and would also bear  11 million inrespect of war pensions increases.    There would be a saving tothe Exchequer of about  8-1 million on national assistance, assuminga national assistance single householder increase of 4s.The differential scheme would cost the Funds  185 million ayear, including  26 million a year from the Exchequer, which wouldalso bear  13 million a year in increases in war pensions;  and the saving on rational assistance would be about  10 million, assuming that the national assistance increases were 2s. on the general ratefor the single householder plus an extra 6s. 6d. for the over-70s.The se savings on national assistance take no account of the cost for&quot;attraction&quot; of new recipients when national assistance scale ratesgo up, as this cannot be estimated.    This additional cost would be higher, and might be substantial, with a national assistancedifferential which would represent for people over 70 by far thehighest increase ever given on national assistance.The graduated national insurance scheme11.     We have considered how the burden on the Funds should be financed.     The majority of us favour finding a substantial part ofthe money (about  44 million) by extending the range of earnings onwhich the 8j per cent graduated contributions are levied from 9- 15 to  9- 18 a week, with a correspondingly larger increase-6-
in the flat-rate contributions paid in respect of employmentscontracted out of the graduated scheme than in those paid in respectof employments participating in it.    The same members also,favour a relatively larger increase in the employer^ contribution in contracted-out employments, making it equal to that of the employee s.12.    We recognise that these two measures will create serious difficulties in a number of contracted out employments, includinglocal government and the National Health Service.    But, while wehave considered a proposal that these difficulties might be avoidedby levying all the required money by increasing the normal flat-rate contributions, the majority of us consider that the objections tothis are overriding.    The main objections are that the resultingrate would be too large for the poorest paid; that men&apos;s average earnings have risen above the top of the graduated scheme which is,therefore, reverting in effect to a flat-rate scheme;  and that itis desirable that the scheme should be extended to offer largergraduated pensions.Conclusion13.    We invite the Cabinet -(a) to decide between the alternative schemes of flat-rate and differential increases in benefits out-lined in paragraphs 4 and 5 above;(b) to approve the inclusion in the Bill of the provisionsoutlined in paragraph 6;(c) to approve the inclusion in the Bill of the provisionsoutlined in paragraph 11.r. m.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1,31st December, 1962.secret
