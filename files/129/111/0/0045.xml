Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1962C. (62) 19527th November, 1962CABINETLONDON OFFICESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerFollowing the discussions at Cabinet on 29th October, 1962, I was invited, inconsultation with the Home Secretary, to consider the proposal by the Minister of housing to amend the Third Schedule to the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947(C.C. (62) 63rd Conclusions, Minute 4).2. The substance of the proposal is to make it possible for the planning authorities to keep rebuilding on sites at present used for offices to 110 per cent,of the existing floor space.3. There is a strong case on merits for doing this. Until it is done, the planning authorities will continue to be badly handicapped in their efforts to hold office development in Central London within reasonable limits. At the same time it is not unreasonable treatment of landowners. They will still have the right tore build with more office space than they now have (or be paid compensation); andthey will still be free to apply (or appeal) for permission to go even bigger in aparticular case.4. I have been concerned, of course, that we should not find ourselves forcedby Parliamentary pressure to incur greater Exchequer liabilities for compensationif we embark upon this course. The Minister of Housing and Local Governmenthas given me an absolute assurance on this point.5. The Home Secretary and I are satisfied that this measure is necessary.Propaganda efforts to persuade employers not to crowd into the central area willnot be enough without some measure of reinforcement. Unless we take this step,we have no answer to those (including the London County Council and the otherplanning authorities in and around London) who attack the Government for notdealing effectively with London&apos;s housing and congestion troubles. Numerousbodies, including Sir Colin Thornton-Kemsley&apos;s Committee, after studying thewhole problem, have come out publicly in favour of amending the Third Schedulein the way proposed.6. We recommend therefore that authority should be given to the Ministerof Housing to prepare legislation to carry through this improvement. It is hopedthat a short Bill will suffice.R. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1.26th November, 1962.Copy No.  51
