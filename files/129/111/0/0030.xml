(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) ..16.^180^ COPY NO.     ^ j;14th november eg,  1962CABINETPOOL BETTING DUTYMemorandum by the Lord Chancelloi^and. theLaw Officers of the CrownThe Chancellor of the Exchequer desires that Customs shouldbe authorised to plead the defence of mistake of lav/ in the actions byBirmingham City and Aston Villa Football Clubs.     This raises issues of principle which affect the Government^ good faith and which are ofparticular concern to us.2.      The question whether this defence should be pleaded in anyparticular case is, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer points out,a question of policy.    It is also a question which the Treasury have since 1949 required Departments to submit to the Law Officers ofthe Crown so as to ensure consistency of policy.     This was the resultof a case in which Customs were sued for the return of money paid aspurchase tax and in which the Judge said that he thought the defenceof mistake of law was one which ought to be used by the Crown withgreat discretion.     (The relevant passage from Mr. Justice Vaisey&apos;judgment is set out in the Annex to this memorandum. )    The Judge&apos;remarks attracted a good deal of attention, both in and outsideParliament.    It was as a result of this that a Treasury circular (ofwhich there is no mention in the memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer) was issued which drew the attention of all departments to the Judge&apos;s observations and required them to arrange that infuture all cases in which it was proposed to raise the defence shouldbe referred to the Law Officers.     On 30th June, 194-9, the thenLord Chancellor (Lord Jowitt) made a full statement in parliament in which he referred to the Treasury circtdar and said that theGovernment had taken steps to ensure that there was consistency ofpolicy amongst all Departments on the matter (House of Lords,Official Report, Fifth Series, Volume 163, Columns 744-746).3.      Such consistency of policy can only be secured by departmental ministers acting on the advice of the Law Officers and from 1949 untilnow this has always been done.
4.      The policy adopted by all Law Officers since 1949 has beennot to sanction the pleading of this defence in respect of a claim for repayment of tax if they are satisfied that the money, if repaid,will get back into the hands of those who really bore the burden of paying it.    If (and only if) it is not possible to ensure that those whotruly bore the burden of paying the money in the first place arereimbursed, the pleading of this defence has been sanctioned on theground that it is better that taxpayers in general should benefit from the mistake rather than that some intermediary should befortuitously and unjustly enriched.     The policy was explained tothe House of Commons by the then Solicitor-General(Sir Jocelyn Simon) on 16th May, 1961, when he gave an undertaking that it would be applied in these cases (House of Commons, official report; Fifth Series, Volume 640, Columns 1304-1326).     Thatundertaking was given after the then Law Officers had advised that,on the facts as they were then known, the defence ought not to bepleaded.5.      No question of moral entitlement to repayment arises.    Butif the defence is pleaded in these cases one can expect in the courts and in Parliament criticism on the ground of the immorality of theCustoms&apos; action in doing so in order to retain money collected astax which they never had any shadow of right to receive.6.      The Law Officers have advised that, as a matter of law inthe light of the information so far given to them as to the rules of theclubs, the real burden of paying the duty unlawfully exacted byCustoms was borne by the prizewinners and they have accordinglyasked Customs to put the simple question to the clubs whether, ifthe money were repaid to them, the prizewinners could and would be reimbursed.     This information (for which the Law Officers have asked on a number of occasions) could have been asked for, and could be asked for now, without in any way embarrassing the Crown&apos;position in the pending litigation.     Therefore the statement by theChancellor of the Exchequer in paragraph 1 of his memorandum thatthe Law Officers do not agree to the pleading of the defence ofmistake in these two cases does not correctly state the position.7.      Liability to repay the tax has until now been denied.     Whenthe matter was considered by the previous Chancellor of theExchequer no writs had been issued and the decision to continue torefuse repayment was taken on the express understanding that thequestion whether the defence of mistake of law should be. pleadedwould be considered if and when proceedings were instituted.     TheLaw Officers are still without the information which would enablethem to decide whether the pleading of the defence would be consistent with the established policy.8.      It was clearly inherent in the policy adopted in 1949 that each case should be separately considered in order to see whetherit is proper to plead the defence.     The fact that it might not bepossible in many of the cases to identify the prizewinners does not warrant the pleading of the defence where it is possible to identifythem.     Parliament, the legal profession, and the public would bemisled if we allowed the decision in an individual case to depend on what might happen in other cases.-2-
9.      If, without the information for which the Law Officers have asked, the defence of mistake of law were pleaded in the presentcases, we should be departing from the arrangements which the then Lord Chancellor told Parliament in 1949 had been made toensure consistency of policy;  abandoning the policy which the thenSolicitor-General assured Parliament in 1961 would be applied tothese two cases;   and rejecting the unequivocal advice of the LawOfficers of the Crown on a matter of law.10.     If the decision is to plead this defence despite the absenceof information v/hich would justify it, then we think that the LawOfficers should no longer be charged with the duty of securingconsistency of policy, and that either fresh arrangements must bemade to that end or Parliament informed of their absence.    Furtherit would, we think, be necessary to inform Parliament that the pledge given by the then Solicitor-General in 1961 on behalf of theGovernment was no longer going to be adhered to.D.J. G.

annex extract from Mr^ Justice^Vaisey&apos;s Judgmentiii j.949 in^Sebej prodjicts Ltd. vvCommissionersjofCustoms and Excise11.....I cannot help feeling that the defence is one which ought tobe used with great discretion, and that for two reasons.    First,because the Defendants being an emanation of the Crown which isthe source and fountain of justice are in my opinion bound to main-tain the highest standards of probity and fair dealing, comparable to those which the Courts, which derive their authority from thesame source and fountain, impose upon the officers under their control;  See Re Tyler,  1907, 1 King&apos;s Bench, page 865.    Secondly,because the taxpayer, who is too often tempted to evade hisliability and to keep in his own pocket money which he ought tohave paid to the Revenue, will find too ready an excuse in the pleathat the Revnue Authorities will, if they can, keep in their coffers,if they can get it there, money which the taxpayer was under no obligation to pay to them, and they had no right to demand.    Althoughsuch an excuse would have no validity in either a court of law or inthe forum of the taxpayer&apos;s own conscience, I think that, in thepublic interest, grounds for proffering it should, so far as possible,be avoided. &quot;-4-COMFBBE(MT!lAL
