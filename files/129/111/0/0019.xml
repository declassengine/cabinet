I am proposing that, in addition to Mr. Geoffrey Lawrence, Q. C.the Chairman, there should initially be four or five members.    Severalsuitable people have expressed willingness to serve and I am satisfiedthat we shall be able to appoint a Commission which will command general confidence.     I contemplate that we might wish to appointfurther members at a later stage, as the work of the Commissionincreases.Terms pf^Ref^erence3. The formal terms of reference of the Commission, which will follow the general lines we have discussed, will be set out in a Royal&quot;Warrant.    Since the language of a Warrant cannot be simple reading,I think that it will be desirable to publish a White Paper, which bothsets out the composition of the Commission and explains in straight-forward language the substance of its terms of reference.    A draft&quot;White Paper is attached.Timing4. It will be helpful to present the White Paper to parliament before 1st November, when economic affairs are likely to be debatedduring the Debate on the Address.    I would accordingly propose, ifthe Cabinet agrees, to present it on the morning of &quot;Wednesday,31st October.R. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.24th October, 1962.
