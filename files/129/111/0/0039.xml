Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1962C. (62) 189 Copy No.26th November, 1962CABINETFUTURE OF THE OFFICER TRAINING CORPSMemorandum by the Minister of DefenceThis note sets out the case for the retention of the Officer Training Corpsunits in 16 Universities in the United Kingdom.2.   The role of these Officer Training Corps is as follows:(a) To provide pre-service training for those undergraduates who considerjoining the Regular Army.(b) To provide pre-service training for candidates for commissions in the ArmyEmergency Reserve, in the Territorial Army and in the Combined CadetForce.(c) To provide a practical link between Service thought and the Universities,thereby fostering interest in the military forces of the nation and in theArmy as one of the instruments in the policy of national defence.These three functions are of equal importance.Regular Recruiting3. The Army is badly in need of officers from the Universities. All majoremployers now recognise the value of recruiting graduates so as to have suitablematerial for filling their highest posts and great efforts are being made by the WarOffice in various ways to attract officers from this source. The supply is, as yet,quite inadequate and it would be most unwise deliberately to risk losing thegraduates who now come forward, by abolishing these units.4. Recruiting generally has certainly not been satisfactory (statistics are at annex A) but the War Office expect to see an improvement, and there are signs ofit this year. The Universities were particularly asked at the end of 1960 to putmore emphasis on regular officer recruiting through their Officer Training Corps.It may well be, therefore, that there will be a significant improvement in recruitingtowards the end of next year when the effect of their efforts on undergraduatesjoining in 1960 will be felt. In any case the Universities should in fairness be given at least the three-year period of a normal University course to show results in termsof recruiting before closures are imposed on them.Reserve Recruiting5. The Officer Training Corps is an important and increasing source of recruitment of young officers for the Reserve Forces. The ending of NationalService means that no more young officers are joining the Territorial Army with previous full-time service. This increases the value of the pre-service trainingprovided by the Officer Training Corps. The statistics at Annex B show that many of the units which have not up to date been good recruiters of regular officers have, nevertheless, made a significant contribution in terms of Territorial army officers. The Corps is also valuable as a source of officers for the Cadet forces now that newly qualified schoolmasters no longer have National Service experience.Links with the Universities6. The abolition of the Officer Training Corps would deprive the Army of its&quot; presence &quot; in the Universities with their increasing populations and would sever a link, which both the War Office and the Universities particularly value, between
the Army and the outside world. This would affect many military activities otherthan regular officer recruitment. The ending of National Service has made it evenmore essential for the Army to maintain its links with the civilian world and its future leaders. The Officer Training Corps has a very real contribution to make in:th&apos;is field, and I understand that the Universities would bitterly resent its abolition.Women&apos;s Units7. The case for the retention of the 14 Women&apos;s Royal Army Corps sub-unitsis less strong and, in the circumstances, I am prepared to agree to their disbandmentwith a consequential saving of about  30,000 a year.cost. The running cost of these units is now about  460,000 a year. Taking intoaccount the abolition of the Women&apos;s units and other agreed economies, this willbe reduced to less than  400,000 a year. A good part of the sum relates to the costof regular Army staff who, if these units were abolished, would simply be transferredto other duties. The immediate saving to Army Votes, in terms of running costs,from abolition would therefore amount to no more than about  230,000 a year. Inmy view this would be wholly false economy. .recommendation . I ask the Cabinet to agree that (subject to the closure of the Women&apos;s units)all the Officer Training Corps units should be retained.P. T.Ministry of Defence, S.W. 1.23rd November, 1962.
