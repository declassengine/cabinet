secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTiPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1962C. (62) 168 Copy No. 5125th October, 1962CABINETTHE PROBLEM IN CENTRAL africa memorandum by the First Secretary of StateIntroductionOn 28th June I announced to the House that I had appointed a small group of Advisers, headed by Sir Roger Stevens, to visit Central Africa and examinethe problem of the future association of the three Territories. They have nowcompleted their work and an abridged version of the Report which they have presented to me is available for study if required. The Report is not intended for publication.2.   There are two issues on which decisions are required now.  These are:(A) The secession of Nyasaland.(B) Our immediate approach to the problem of the two Rhodesias.These questions are inter-connected and I deal with them in the following paragraphs.(A) THE SECESSION OF NYASALAND3. The Advisers have recommended that Nyasaland should be granted theright to secede from the Federation at the time of the Constitutional conference which opens on 12th November (as a prelude to the negotiation at the Conferenceof internal self-government as the first step towards independence within theCommonwealth).Economic and Financial Implications4. It is clear that the effects of this step on the financial and economic position of Nyasaland would be grave. The territory would find itself with anannual deficit of something like  5 million on a  14 million budget, as comparedwith a deficit of  1-5 million on a  9 million budget this year. This estimate isbased on the assumptions that Nyasaland would maintain the present level ofexpenditure on services within Nyasaland now provided by the federal government, and would take over her due share of liability for the Federal debt;also that she would secure that amount of revenue now raised in the territory by the Federal Government, plus tariffs on goods from the Rhodesias. On this basis, Nyasaland would face very serious financial and political problems as shemoved forward towards separate independence within the Commonwealth, and afterwards.5. On the other hand, although Malawi Ministers are prepared broadly toaccept this assessment of Nyasaland&apos;s financial difficulties, they are not in theleast shaken in their determination to secede.   We have achieved something by
obliging them to face more realistically the problems that will confront them.They maintain however that, given sympathetic treatment by the BritishGovernment over the next five years or so, they can solve their difficulties &quot; bya combination of retrenchment, increased taxes, agricultural and industrialdevelopment, foreign borrowing and nationalist enthusiasm &quot;.6. Professor Brown (the Economist in the Advisers group) has expressedthe view that their hope of balancing their budget within this sort of period,although optimistic, might not be too optimistic provided that sufficient temporaryexternal aid is forthcoming to keep up the momentum of economic expansion.A considerable potential commitment for Her Majesty&apos;s Government is of courseinvolved, and a claim upon us for substantially increased assistance over the nextfew years is to be expected. But the approach of Malawi Ministers appears to acknowledge that Nyasaland can never be truly independent until she is financiallyindependent. They look forward to the negotiation of a &quot; tapered off &quot; financial settlement with the United Kingdom Government. In the circumstances thiswould probably be the best solution from our point of view.Political Considerations7. I informed my colleagues in my paper of 20th June (C. (62) 100) that itwas going to be extremely difficult to defer the secession issue beyond the autumn.I am now convinced that in the special circumstances of Nyasaland, we can nolonger spin out time. Indeed, if the right of secession is not conceded as the starting point of the Constitutional Conference next month, the probability isthat Dr. Banda will decline to attend, and withdraw from the Government. Weshould then very rapidly find ourselves in the situation of attempting to holdNyasaland in the Federation by force against the declared wishes of its inhabitants.Such an attempt would in the long run. be likely to prove both more expensivefinancially than facing the consequences of secession, and also extremely costlyin terms of our international reputation.8. I am also sure that only when he has achieved internal self-governmentand secession will Dr. Banda be disposed, politically and emotionally, to facesquarely the problems which he will have to solve before he can hope to makeNyasaland function as an independent State, Our wisest course is to move as quickly as possible towards that position which is also calculated to improve the chances of bringing Dr. Banda to recognise the advantages, in relation to his ownfinancial and economic problems, of some continued association with the Rhodesias.Proposed Statement9. I therefore seek the agreement of my colleagues to a statement, beforethe Consitutional Conference begins its work, of Her Maiesty&apos;s governments acceptance in principle that Nyasaland should be allowed to withdraw from theFederation, and of their readiness to take formal steps to this end as soon as the detailed negotiations necessary to implement this decision can be completed.10. It will be necessary for the statement also to make clear that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment, in accepting the secession of Nyasaland, will expect the NyasalandGovernment to shoulder the consequential commitments and obligations, politicaland financial, which flow from this step. Many matters of this kind will haveto be examined and negotiated, but in particular it will be incumbent upon the nyasaland Government to bear a due proportion of the Federal national debt,and also to accept their proper responsibilities in regard to the problems whichwill arise over the redeployment and possible displacement and compensation of individual Federal officials.11. We shall have to follow up this statement by early action, by way of acommission or otherwise, to work out the various problems involved in detachingthe territory. Dr. Banda is believed to envisage a period of about nine monthsf or this process. At least as long as this will be needed, and with the otherFederal complications still on our hands it might well prove difficult to complete the work before the end of 1963. This means that we should hope to be cleareron the general Federal problem before the actual secession of Nyasaland takes place. In that event there should be time to evolve some new form of association between Nyasaland and the Rhodesias though this will not be easy.
SECRET-.1(B) NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN rhodesia the Immediate Problem12. The decision on Nyasaland cannot be taken in isolation. The federal prime Minister, Sir Roy Welensky (and at least some members of his Cabinet),is now conditioned to the prospect of Nyasaland&apos;s secession. He has however made it clear to me that the Federal Government will strongly oppose any decisionto allow Nyasaland to secede unless this forms part of a general settlementproviding for a strong and &quot; permanent &quot; political association between northern and Southern Rhodesia. Clearly the nature of the future association of the twoRhodesias cannot be settled before the decision on Nyasaland is taken and announced in November. In these circumstances strong reactions must beexpected from the Federal Government. I have promised Sir Roy Welensky thatI will consult with him when we have reached our conclusions here.13. Moreover this announcement will produce a reaction in the other territories. The African Nationalist Parties (as also the Liberal Party) in northern rhodesia have long been campaigning for the secession of that Territory. whatever the results of the Northern Rhodesia elections may be, this campaign is bound tobe intensified once it is known that Nyasaland is to go. Moreover, the PrimeMinister of Southern Rhodesia, Sir Edgar Whitehead, although anxious to maintain a strong association between the Rhodesias, is deeply dissatisfied with certain features of the present Federal association. He may therefore well attempt to reserve a right to negotiate the best terms he can with Northern Rhodesia outsidethe Federal framework.14. We therefore have to devise a line of approach to the problem of thetwo Rhodesias (including the possibility of a modified form of association betweenthem and Nyasaland) which:(i) will provide a steadying influence in the difficult situation described inparagraphs 12 and 13 above;(ii) will enable us to handle the local situation effectively during the months immediately ahead; and(iii) will take account of the exigencies of our political situation at home.Alternative Approaches(a) An Immediate Conference15. The Advisers have proposed that the decision to allow Nyasaland tosecede should be embodied in a statement (to be agreed if possible with the federal government) which would announce the intention of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentto call a Conference with the Federal and Territorial Governments early in theNew Year &quot; to reach an early decision as to the effect of Nyasaland&apos;s secession onthe future relationship between the Rhodesias and to decide what constitutional changes are required in relation to them &quot;. The Advisers anticipate that such aConference would demonstrate the impossibility of reaching agreement on the basisof a Federal solution, and propose that in these circumstances an alternative form of association should then be negotiated between the Territories on lines which her majesty&apos;s Government would themselves have indicated.16. This proposal has certain advantages. Persuasively^ presented it might do a good deal to curb the immediate reactions of the Federal Government andin the other Territories to the prospective secession of Nyasaland. It would alsoenable the difficulties of maintaining a Federal association to be brought outthrough the confrontation of the parties themselves. On the other hand I seeadvantage in following the second alternative as set out below. If there is to beany chance at all of achieving an asssociation as I indicate in paragraph 19, I donot think that January is the time to bring things to a head.(b) Bilateral Conversations17. An alternative course, which I prefer, would be to initiate bilateralconversations with the Federal and Territorial Governments in the light of theelection results in Northern and Southern Rhodesia. The possibility of an eventualConference would not be excluded, but we would hold this in reserve.   The
advantage of this course is that we would not be committed to holding a Conferenceat a time when we may not have been able fully to assess the import of the /electionresults in Northern and Southern Rhodesia a Conference, moreover, which would(almost certainly) bring the Federal issue to a head earlier than we might wish. Ofcourse it would be extremely difficult to find a basis for fruitful bilateral discussions with the Territorial Governments which would also be acceptable to the federal government.18. But with the present situation in Southern Rhodesia, and with the uncertainty of the Northern Rhodesia election result, it will be realised that any future association will be very difficult to achieve. I would rather take a little time to explore the ground. Under this second alternative we have more chanceof bringing things to a head at a time which suits us and our situation at home.19. I should like to make plain that if I can help ease and improve thesituation it would be my earnest desire to secure some form of association between north and South, preferably based on an association of the Governments.SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS20.  I ask my colleagues to agree:(i) that before the Nyasaland Conference starts work Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment should announce their acceptance in principle thatNyasaland should be allowed to withdraw from the Federation(paragraphs 9 and 10), and(ii) that at the same time Her Majesty&apos;s Government should announce their intention of initiating, in the light of the elections in northern and Southern Rhodesia, bilateral conversations with the Federal and territorial Governments, leaving the question of a Conference to bedecided in the light of these conversations (paragraphs 17 and 18).My first step would be to consult with Sir Roy Welensky and others concerned on this basis.R. A. B.Office of the First Secretary of State, S.W. 1,24th October, 1962.
