C. (62) 6lst Conclusions,Minute 3) to consider the legal justification for the imposition of theAmerican &quot;quarantine&quot; of Cuba with a view to briefing the UnitedKingdom Permanent Representative at the United Nations.2. I have, in consultation with the Attorney-General, the solicitor-General and the -Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office,considered the instructions already sent by the Foreign Office tothe Permanent Representative  (Foreign Office telegram No. 3881to New York (Annex &apos;A&apos;)) in response to his request (New Yorktelegram No. 1703 (Annex &apos;B&apos;)).    We agree with the views expressedby the Foreign Office.3. In our view the imposition of the &quot;quarantine&quot; cannot bejustified as &quot;pacific blockade&quot; under international law. In fact,the United States&apos; conduct is not in conformity with internationallaw.We think that the most favourable line of argument that can be advanced in support of the United States is that the conductof Cuba and the Soviet Union constitutes a threat to the United Statesof such imminence as to necessitate the taking of immediate stepsto render that threat nugatory.    But we doubt that this can beestablished as the United States&apos; action appears to be designed toprevent the threat becoming imminent.If the threat could be regarded as immediate, the rightof self-defence would entitle them under international law to destroy the missile sites and they would be equally entitled to stop war-headsreaching those sites.     The issue depends on the immediacy of the threat being sufficient to justify the United States in acting beforehaving recourse to the Security Council.4. We are agreed that the situation in Cuba constitutes a threat to peace under Article 39 of the United Nations Charter. r&apos;5. &quot;We have also considered what would be the best line for ministers to take in Parliament if they are pressed to comment on thelegality of the United States&apos; action.     In our view the best line wouldbe to state the accepted principles of international law as to the rightof self-defence, but to refuse to express any opinion as to theirapplicability in circumstances which are not yet fully known.-1-
5. &quot;We think it important that we should make it clear to theUnited States Government exactly what our views are on the legality of the proposed blockade and emphasise that, while in the presentcircumstances we will co-operate with them and not stand on ourrights, we do not concede that they have any legal right to search ordetain British ships on the high seas.     I suggest, therefore, that wesend to the United States Government a communication on thefollowing lines:-&quot;Her Majesty&apos;s Government regret that after carefulconsideration they are not satisfied as to the legality of the blockade   .measures to be taken by the United States against Cuba in the absenceof adequate cover from a competent organ of the United Nations.Nevertheless, they fully sympathise with the measures and under-stand the reasons that have made them necessary.     They will givethe fullest possible support in the Security Council and, if need be,in the General Assembly, and they hope that all British ships will infact co-operate with the United States&apos; armed forces so far as thoseships may be affected by the blockade measures.    But Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment also fully endorse the decision of &quot;^he JBiutiah Chamber Z^r&quot; ^&amp;  Ghipprt-n-g that the legal rights of British ships should be reserved.Although Her Majesty&apos;s Government do not, in present circumstances,intend to stand on their legal rights in this matter, they also must reserve the right to extend such diplomatic and legal protection toBritish shipping as may be permissible in accordance with inter-nationa.1 law. &quot;If we send such a communication to the United StatesGovernment it might prove very useful in Parliament if we arecriticised for permitting the search of Bijitish vessels.D.House of Lords, S. W. 1.24th October, 1962.
COPY OF FOREIGN OFFICE TELEGRAM No. 3881TO THE UNITED KINGDOM MISSION TO THE UNITED NATIONS23rd October, 1962.Your telegram No. 1703:   Cuba.If the sequence of events works out as expected, I think you should make a short and sharp intervention in support of the americans at whatever moment you think appropriate during the debate.2.        In view of the difficulty of the legal case, you should leave it to the Americans to defend the legality of their blockade.    for your own information, while it may be possible to justify actionagainst Cuban ships and possibly against Soviet ships, I am advised that in the absence of United Nations authority it is very difficultto justify action against the ships of third countries.    If you feel obliged to say anything on this point, it should be to the effect thatthere is an inflammable situation, that there is no virtue in a detailed examination of the legal point by the Security Council, thatthe Americans have acted properly by corning to the security council at the first possible moment, and that the Council shouldtake immediate steps to deal with the situation.     The inference maybe left that the Americans were justified in taking immediateemergency action having regard to all the circumstances.    Theimportant thing now is to obtain adequate United Nations cover, for what the Americans are doing, and for that purpose the finding ofa threat to peace is vital.3.        We do not dispute that a sovereign State is entitled to call for military aid from another Government if necessary for thepurpose of its defence.     In no case in which the United kingdom has been involved have we gone beyond this.     The situation inCuba is entirely different.     The threat comes not from withoutagainst Cuba but from within Cuba against its neighbours,&apos; and the threat is created by the import of the offensive weapons which theSoviet Union seeks to defend on the basis of the right of Govern-ments to ask for military aid in their own self-defence.4.        We see considerable difficulty in the argument about&quot;secret disturbance of the balance of power&quot;.     While the presenceof Soviet missiles in Cuba no doubt greatly increases Sovietstriking power, it could still be argued that total American nuclearstrength was still ahead of Soviet nuclear strength.     We thinkthat it would be better to emphasise and elaborate on other points in the Presidents speech as follows :-
(i)    This is a deliberately provocative action, particularly at a time when disarmament negotiations are inprogress.(ii)    The secrecy with which the transfer of SovietmissiJas has been conducted, and the deliberatelymisleading statements made on the subject,contrasts with the American attitude towards the stationing of their own missiles in other territories and can only give rise to the inevitable inferencethat they are not for purely defensive purposes andtherefore constitute a threat to the peace,5.        These seem to us to be far the most powerful general argu-ments and we think that it would be best to concentrate on them.There is the comparatively subsidiary point that the transfer of soviet missiles has been taking place at a time when, there havebeen American/Soviet conversations about limiting the spread of nuclear weapons, and the prospect of further discussion on thissubject in the General Assembly.     There is also the propagandapoint that the transfer has taken place at a time when the soviet union are urging the complete abolition of foreign bases during thefirst stage of disarmament, i. e. , within 18 months according totheir own plan.6.        With reference to paragraph 3 of your telegram, in theevent of a Soviet veto you may support the Americans if they wishto rGfer the matter to the General Assembly.
ANNEX .IB&apos;COPY OF NEW YORK (UNITED KINGDOM mission to THE UNITED NATIONS) TELEGRAM N.O..J703&quot; TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE&quot;Sir l-atrick Dean. 23rd October, 1962.My telegrams Nos. 1698 and 1699:  Cuba.I would expect the sequence of events in the Security Councilto be as follows.    Possibly after a procedural wrangle, the UnitedStates representative would speak first.    He would be followed by the cuban representative who will have been invited to the table and thenby the Soviet representative.     Thereafter, the United States Missionwould hope for interventions by the two Latin-American members ofthe Council (Venezuela and Chile).     The Americans would then, Ithink, look to us to speak next.     The other members would have no interest in pushing themselves forward.     The French here expect that they will have to speak in the course of the day.2. When the issue comes to the vote the Americans should beable to count on seven votes in favour, provided they can keep theIrish and Chileans up to the mark.    I would expect Ghana and theUnited Arab Republic to abstain and the Rumanian and soviet representatives would of course vote against, the latter casting have to.3. The Americans are still undecided about whether to go forthe uniting for peace procedure in the event of a Soviet veto.    Theyhave some doubts about whether they will be able to muster a sufficiently impressive majority in the General Assembly, but unless the Soviet response in the Security Council shows some signsof a desire to negotiate they may be compelled to move from theSecurity Council to the General Assembly.    Much also depends on how the Organisation of American States&apos; meeting goes and howsolid the support of the Latin American countries is.4, As for our speech, at first sight the most difficult pointswill probably be the legal ones.     We should therefore be grateful for as full a briefing as possible on what we should say about the&quot;quarantine&quot;.     We should also like material to deal with the argument which we frequently use that any sovereign State is entitledto call for military aid from another Government if they feel their security is threatened.-1-
5. In his broadcast the President laid great stress on the&quot;secret disturbance of the balance of power&quot;.     This seems an effective way of dealing with the argument that, as the Americansmaintain missile bases in certain European countries, the russians are equally entitled to maintain them in Cuba.     The President alsostressed the importance; of the balance of nuclear power, which was emphasised by you in your speech to the General Assembly, and given the probable difficulties in the legal case it seems to methat this might be a profitable line to pursue.     If you agree, pleaselet us have as much supporting material as possible.-2-
