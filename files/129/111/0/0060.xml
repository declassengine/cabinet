SECRETTIMS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENT 259Printed for the Cabinet. December 1962 &apos;C. (62) 210 Copy No.  5131st December, 1962CABINETPROPOSALS FOR . SENDING TECHNICIANS OF THE BIRMINGHAMSMALL ARMS COMPANY TO SOUTH africa memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the treasury and Paymaster general at the suggestion of the First Secretary of State, whom I have consulted, Iam seeking, as Chairman of the Strategic Exports Committee, the guidance of mycolleagues to a proposal which has been submitted to and approved by themembers of that Committee.2.   Some time ago the Birmingham Small Arms Company (B.S.A.) sirppliecthe South African Government with plant for the production of the-LiWITrhle^- *^js(the British version of the FN).  The South Africans have now asked for the help of technicians from this country in helping them to start production of the rifle,and B.S.A. are willing to make the men available if authorised to do so.3.   The question for decision is whether we should agree that these techniciansshould be sent.4. In normal circumstances, having supplied the plant, it would seem to be both odd and contrary to our economic interests to object to technicians being sent to help operate it.5. I think the decision will turn on whether my colleagues think that thesituation in South Africa, and in the United Nations, is such as to make it toopolitically embarrassing to give help to the South Africans in the manufacture ofrifles. It must be admitted that, whatever may be said of heavier war material which we have supplied to the South Africans, rifles are possible instruments of&quot; repression &quot;.6. As above indicated, the unanimous view of members of the strategic exports Committee is that we should allow these technicians to go. Although Iwould have had serious doubts as to the wisdom of this in present circumstances ifthis had been the beginning of a new transaction designed to facilitate themanufacture of rifles, I think on balance that it is right to agree to the techniciansgoing for the purpose of efficiently completing a transaction already embarked upon.There seems to be no reason to assume that by objecting to the sending of B.S.A.technicians we would prevent rifles from being manufactured at all. and action ofthis sort would clearly not be helpful in the context of future United Kingdomarms exports.J. A. B.-C.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,28th December, 1962.
