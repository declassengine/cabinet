Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1962C. (62) 200 Copy No.   514th December, 1962CABINETCAMBODIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsPrince Sihanouk of Cambodia has been much upset by the constant intrusionsover his borders of Thai and South Vietnamese troops. Not only does this bringloss of life and property, but it causes him to think that the Thais and Vietnameseare pursuing their ancient attempts to partition Cambodia. In August therefore the Prince asked for an international conference of all the nations which had attended the recent Laos conference in Geneva, to draw up a treaty for Cambodiasimilar to that for Laos. The Communist Powers accepted but we, the Americans,the Indians and others did not because we did not want to be involved in freshcommitments.   This annoyed Prince Sihanouk.2. The Prince has now produced draft proposals for a Cambodian Agreement.This follows the Laotian Treaty in providing for the neutrality and independence of the country, but also goes a good deal further in asking for guarantees of the frontiers. The obvious intention is that the Americans should thus become responsible for forcibly restraining the Thais and Vietnamese from further borderincidents.3. It is in our interests that Cambodia should be genuinely neutral and anagreement to this effect would not add in practice to our existing obligations inCambodia. Frontier guarantees are a different matter, particularly since the borders of Cambodia are ill-defined. On the other hand, if we reject PrinceSihanouk&apos;s proposals, he has threatened to break his ties with the West and tocall in Chinese troops to protect his frontiers. This would be a very serious setbackto our policies in South Vietnam and Laos.4. In these circumstances we are trying to persuade the Americans andFrench that we should accept Prince Sihanouk&apos;s proposals in form, but tell him that certain provisions will have to be altered. We would try, as part of thenegotiations, to get arrangements for the delimitation and demarcation of theCambodian frontiers and for control of border incidents by Mixed Commissionsunder international supervision. The frontier guarantees asked for by PrinceSihanouk would then no longer be necessary and he might be satisfied with no more than what we gave to Laos. We may, however, have considerable difficultyin achieving this because of the reluctance of Thais and South Vietnamese tocome to any terms with Prince Sihanouk. We shall try to achieve our aims withouta conference, but may in the end be obliged to accept one.H.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,3rd December, 1962.
