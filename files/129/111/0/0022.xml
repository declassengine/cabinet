Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1962C. (62) 172Copy No-51r, 1962CABEVETTREATY OF COMMERCE, NAVIGATION AND ESTABLISHMENTWITH Japan Memorandum by the President of the Board of trade the negotiations for the conclusion of a Treaty of Commerce, Navigationand Establishment with Japan which have been in progress since 1956 have nowbeen completed. My colleagues have been kept in touch with the progress ofthese negotiations in a series of papers the last of which was C. (62) 113, and theyhave already approved both the general principle of the Treaty and to a largeextent the detailed arrangements for safeguarding domestic industries. TheTreaty with its associated documents, if finally approved by the United Kingdomand Japanese Governments, will be ready for signature when the Japanese PrimeMinister visits London on 12th-15th November. I think we can safely assume that the Japanese Government will accept the draft Treaty, and I hope that mycolleagues will agree that we should do so and will authorise its signature onbehalf of the United Kingdom.The Treaty2. The Treaty itself is in the usual form for commercial treaties and providesfor the exchange of most-favoured-nation treatment (and in some cases nationaltreatment) in respect of persons, companies, establishment rights, shipping and goods. The Japanese have fallen in with our views at almost every point over thedifficulties about companies and shipping which I mentioned in C. (62) 113, andI regard the outcome on these matters as very satisfactory.Accession of Colonies3. The same paper mentioned certain problems regarding the accession of colonies to the Treaty. On this subject it has been agreed that Colonies whichcan accept the Treaty without modification can accede simply by notification beingmade to the Japanese Government; if, however, a Colony requires modifications,these will have to be agreed with the Japanese Government before accession.The Japanese have, however, assured us that in such cases they will raise noobjection in principle to the accession of a Colony, other than Hong Kong,provided that the modifications sought are of a minor character. In the case of hong Kong, the Japanese have said that they cannot agree to accession without qualification because of doubts about the possible infiltration of mainland Chineseinto Japan through Hong Kong and their unwillingness to give establishmentrights to Hong Kong companies which might be controlled by Chinese. Wehave therefore said that we will not extend the Treaty to the Colony until agreement has been reached with the Japanese Government. This arrangementhas been accepted by the Government of Hong Kong. Even without accession,Hong Kong will be able to secure most-favoured-nation rights in Japan ii shedecides, as she probably will, to withdraw her invocation of Article XXXV ofthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY QE HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
Safeguard Provisions to Protect Domestic and Colonial Industries4. Two Protocols and certain letters annexed to the Treaty deal withderogations from the most-favoured-nation provisions which will permit us to restrict imports of Japanese goods so far as is necessary to protect our own industries against disruption. Under the first of these Protocols (the SafeguardProtocol) either party will have the right to impose restrictions in cases whereimports cause or threaten disruption; a period of 30 days is provided for consultation before such action is. taken during which other remedies might befound, e.g., self-imposed restraint by the Japanese. In urgent cases action maybe taken to restrict imports on seven days&apos; notice. When either party takes action under this Protocol, the other has the right to retaliate to an equivalent extent.5. The protection afforded by this Protocol, may be extended to benefitColonial goods in which there is an established trade with the United Kingdom,i.e., a trade which was substantial at the time when the Treaty comes into effect,as envisaged in C. (62) 113. We have successfully resisted Japanese pressure to limit this benefit to Colonies which have acceded to the Treaty, but before a Colonycan invoke the safeguard it will be expected to have withdrawn the invocation ofArticle XXXV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against Japan.The Sensitive List6. The second Protocol (the Sensitive List Protocol) will allow us to retainrestrictions for a period of years on a number of sensitive items without proof ofdisruption. The items to which this procedure will apply together with the datesby which we undertake to liberalise them and the quotas which we shall allow for imports from Japan during the intervening period are set out in Annex A.These are in accordance with the proposals which were approved by the Cabineton 10th July (C.C. (62) 45th Conclusions, Minute 4), except that we agree to terminate the restrictions on metal toys in five years&apos; time instead of retainingthem without time limit, we have accepted a reference to 1968 as a &quot; target &quot; date for the termination of the restrictions on pottery but without any sort ofcommitment that we shall in fact terminate the restrictions then, and we havemade a minor concession on unassembled parts of sewing machines, microscopesand binoculars.7. The Cabinet earlier agreed (C.C. (60) 62nd Conclusions, Minute 10) thatin suitable cases I should accept control of exports by the Japanese instead of restrictions enforced by us on imports. The remaining sensitive items (including all the textiles), as approved by the Cabinet in the above-mentioned Conclusions(apart from the deletion of radio gramophones, to which the Minister of Aviationhas agreed), will be controlled in this way. For these goods the JapaneseGovernment will authorise exports only within limits which have previously beenagreed with us, and the United Kingdom Customs will admit only consignmentsfor which the proper authorisations are produced. The control will thus be similar to the controls which have been operated for some time by theGovernments of India, Pakistan and Hong Kong on exports of cotton textilesto the United Kingdom market. The Japanese Government already havearrangements to restrict their exports in this way with a number of other countries,including the United States, Canada and Australia. I am satisfied that inconjunction with the check which our Customs will operate on the goods whenthey arrive in this country we shall find it a satisfactory method of restriction,though there may be some criticism from our industries. If in any case it shouldbreak down we shall be entitled to impose our own restrictions under the generalSafeguard Protocol.8. Formally, the Japanese Government^ intention to apply &quot; voluntary&quot;export control to these goods will be recorded in a letter from the JapaneseGovernment which will be signed at the same time as the Treaty. A separate letter(which will be confidential although we shall be free to disclose its substance) willrecord in detail the arrangements which the Japanese Government have agreedto observe in applying the control. Under these arrangements quotas have beenagreed for each item as set out in Annex B. The quotas provide for a moderateincrease in the first year over those at present in force and for a reasonablerate of increase in subsequent years. Except in three cases, no dates are set forliberalisation of these goods and the Japanese control will not be discontinuedexcept by agreement with us.   The three exceptions are radio equipment and
transistors; the heavier types of wool cloth which, as agreed by the Cabinet on19th July (C.C. (62) 48th Conclusions, Minute 4), will be liberalised ind964 only if the Japanese then reduce the high temporary duties on imports of wool clothwhich they at present enforce and liberalise their own imports; and light-weightsilk cloth, which will be liberalised on 1st January, 1966. I have not yet beenable to reach final agreement with the Japanese about the quotas for radioequipment, etc., wool cloth and silk cloth, but I expect to do so in the nextfew days.Duration9. The Treaty will remain in force for an initial period of five, six or seven years from the date of ratification. (The precise period is still under negotiation.)Thereafter it will continue at a year&apos;s notice. The Protocols will have the sameduration as the Treaty.Withdrawal from Article XXXV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT)10. When the Treaty has been ratified by both sides we shall withdraw ourinvocation of Article XXXV of the GATT and enter into GATT relations with japan. On the face of it, the arrangements under the two Protocols which enable us to discriminate against Japanese imports would be inconsistent with our GATTobligations. The Japanese have agreed, however, to the exchange of confidentialletters to the effect that neither party will exercise their GATT rights in respect ofany action taken consistently with either Protocol. Although the existence of this letter is to remain confidential, we shall be free to state publicly that we have an assurance to this effect from the Japanese.Japanese Export Subsidies11. I have made it clear to the Japanese Government all along that thedifficulties for us of signing the Treaty would be much eased if they would withdraw the tax rebate on export profits which Japanese companies at present obtain. I am glad to say that I have been promised a letter from the Japanese Foreign minister before the Treaty is signed (the Japanese are anxious to keep this issue separate fromthe Treaty) to the effect that it is the Japanese Government^ intention not to renew the legislation on this subject when it expires early in 1964 and before that date to subscribe to the GATT Declaration (adherence to which is optional) forbiddingthe use of this and other forms of export subsidy.Interim Trade Arrangements12. Since the Treaty is not likely to come into effect until April or May of nextyear owing to Japanese ratification procedures, it will be necessary to extend the1961-62 Trade Arrangements which expired at the end of last month to cover the intervening period. The Japanese are liberalising some useful items and giving ussubstantial quota increases on others when the Treaty is signed. I propose thereforeat the same time to place on Open General Licence a few of the items due forliberalisation under the Treaty and to increase the quota for some others (mainlyoutside the textile field) to a point about half-way between the current quotas andthose which will take effect in the first year of the Treaty.Recommendation13. Accordingly, I ask my colleagues to approve the draft Treaty, and thevarious provisions and arrangements relating to it.F. J. E.Board of Trade, S.W. 1,29th October, 1962.
