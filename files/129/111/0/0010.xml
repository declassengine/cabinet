Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1962C. (62) 160 Copy No.    5118th October, 1962CABINETUNITED NATIONS BONDSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Cabinet will remember that on 29th January the Lord Privy Seal announced in Parliament that we would buy United Nations Bonds within a maximum of$12 million subject to the cash requirements of the Organisation and the extent towhich other countries subscribed (Hansard, columns 689-692). Later our mission in New York was instructed to inform the Acting Secretary-General of our decision and to tell him that, for Parliamentary reasons, it would not be possible for us to buy any bonds before July 1962 (i.e., until the passage of the Appropriations Act);but that, if our conditions were fulfilled, we expected to make our initial purchaseas soon as the necessary legislation had been adopted.2. As the United Nations deficit is likely to approach $200 million by theend of the year, the first of our conditions is met; and as 49 other United Nationsmembers (including the United States) have made or pledged purchases totalling about $150 million our second condition has also been fulfilled. The AppropriationsAct received the Royal Assent during the first few days of August and there is noParliamentary bar to an immediate purchase.3. The Cabinet last discussed this matter on 25th January (C.C. (62) 9thConclusions, Minute 2). I have deferred bringing it to their attention again untilnow because of uncertainty about the terms on which the United States congress would agree to an American purchase of bonds and because United Nations actionin the Congo might have made it very difficult for us to justify our purchase inParliament. The United States Government have now approved legislation authorising the President to purchase bonds up to a maximum of $100 million but&quot; not exceeding the aggregate amount of loans made by other nations &quot; in other words the United States will match the purchases made (not simply pledged) byother Governments within a total of $100 million.4. Subscriptions paid now total about $34 million. The United States willpurchase a similar amount of bonds soon; and, as more than eight months have elapsed since we gave our pledge and the cash needs of the United Nations become more urgent as each month passes, we must expect that pressure on us to make animmediate purchase of bonds will build up rapidly over the next few weeks. TheMinister of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Godber, who is now in New York, has suggested that this is as favourable a moment as we are likely to get to redeem atleast part of our pledge and recommends that we buy bonds to the value of$6 million immediately. Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington stronglysupports this recommendation but advises that the holding back of $6 million wouldmake a deplorable impression in the United States; he therefore proposes that webuy our full quota of $12 million now. (The texts of New York telegram No. 1554and Washington telegram No. 2538 containing these recommendations are annexed.)5. The purpose of the bond issue was to pay off a United Nations deficitamounting at the end of 1961 to about $100 million. In practice most of the moneysubscribed so far has had to be used for current expenses, including those of theUnited Nations operations in the Congo, rather than for paying off old bills; sincethe last period for which members were assessed for the Congo operation endedon 30th June of this year, anything we subscribe to the bond issue will be usedindirectly to pay for this operation.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
6. Funds for current expenses in the Congo could theoretically be providedby a further assessing resolution for the Congo at&quot; the present session of the general assembly. The United States Administration are, however, against a furtherassessment because they believe that Congress, having been induced with difficulty to pass the Bond Bill, would be unwilling to contribute a further $20 million orrrnore to the Congo operation on an assessed basis. In the face of American^opposition, there is no chance of a majority being found for an assessing resolution,to which, the bond issue must therefore be seen as an alternative. From our pointof view it is the better alternative, since it leaves us some freedom to decide how much we shall contribute and when.7. Although the United Nations have not always behaved with good sense inthe Congo and elsewhere, the conclusion to which we have come is that it is in our long-term interest that the United Nations should not be reduced to completeimpotence. We have also accepted that it is most important that an early settlement should be reached in the Congo; and that the chances of this being peacefullyaccomplished would be much reduced if the United Nations were obliged to admitfailure and bankruptcy and withdraw. It was with this consideration in mind thatthe Cabinet recently decided to make a contribution of $2 million in short-termaid to the Congo and that they would be ready to consider with other interested governments and with the United Nations the possibility of making a further contribution in support of a settlement in the Congo in the light of theirheavy financial obligation in respect of the Colonies and the Commonwealth(C.C. (62) 55th Conclusions, Minute 3).8. It could be argued that we should continue to postpone our purchase ofbonds until we can be surer that a negotiated settlement can be achieved. both parties having accepted the Proposal for National Reconciliation, the key question at present is whether they can be brought to co-operate in carrying it out in detail.The latest news of the Commissions in Leopoldville holds out some hope but the outcome is still impossible to predict. It may be some time before we can be certain one way or the other.9. In the United Nations context a powerful objection to postponing adecision much longer is that no condition as to the use to which our money mightbe put was attached to our original pledge, and to introduce one now as a reasonfor withholding our contribution would almost certainly expose us to charges of bad faith and upset our friends, particularly in the United States, Western europe and the Commonwealth.10. I am inclined to think we should purchase the whole $12 million now;but there is no doubt that the United Nations are getting very impatient and may-impose sanctions on Katanga.   I would therefore value a discussion in Cabinet.H.16th October, 1962.AnnexTEXT OF NEW YORK TELEGRAM No. 1554 FROM THE MINISTEROF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSCongress has, in effect, now approved funds for purchase by the administrationof United Nations bonds up to a total of $100 million on the basis of matching to total of actual purchases by other countries. The Americans want to make as large a purchase as possible very soon. They may wait at least until the Germansmake their purchase of $10 million next week, as now expected. But we shalldoubtless be pressed to help increase the amount which the Americans can subscribeby making a substantial purchase quickly.2. We are committed to a purchase, and this would appear to be as favourablea moment as we are likely to get to redeem at least part of our pledge.  As seen
from here, purchase at this time would please both the Secretariat and the americans and it would be welcomed by many other delegations. As seen from home, itwould appear that the United Nations is not at the moment as unpopular as it hasbeen at times in the past or as it is likely to be again before very long. AlsoParliament is not sitting and it might be well to get the purchase over and let itbe overtaken by other events before Parliament reassembles.3. If no purchase is made soon we shall come under pressure here and from certain sections at home while we may well be faced in a few weeks&apos; time with avery harsh resolution on Southern Rhodesia and possibly another Congo crisis.To purchase bonds under such conditions would be intolerable to opinion athome, while to refuse to purchase would be seen here as a repudiation of our oftvaunted claim that we support the United Nations even when we disagree withits actions.4. If we subscribed, say, half our maximum amount at about the same time as the German purchase, the Americans could then put in about $50 million, andthe organisation^ cash resources would be increased by over $72 million this month.However, the capacity of the United Nations to act objectionably in the Congo,if they so chose, would not depend on our decision about the bonds, if only because there would be about $60 million anyway from the Americans, Canadians and germans. At the same time, we should still retain some leverage in respect ofany further bond purchases by the United Kingdom.5. I conclude that, on balance, the right course would be for Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to purchase United Nations bonds to the value of $6 million withinthe next week or 10 days if possible.TEXT OF TELEGRAM No. 2538 FROM HER MAJESTVS ambassador in WASHINGTONCongress is expected to pass the appropriation for the American contributioneither to-day or tomorrow.2. According to the State Department, other countries&apos; contributions so faramount to $34 million, plus the German pledge of $10 million to be paid onOctober 17. The State Department at present have no timetable for UnitedStates matching contributions. But they would expect their first contribution tobe made in a matter of 10 days or so and further contributions to be made insteps of about $10 million or $20 million as other countries contribute.3. One of the consequences of the battle with Congress over this matter isthat the administration are determined to put even more effort in trying to makea success of the bond issue as a whole. Apart from this, the administrationconsider that the more success is achieved in raising speedily and fully contributions to the bond issue, the better the prospects will be for collecting United Nationsarrears, and for long-term financing of the United Nations.4. In view of these considerations, I would recommend that we should makea speedy purchase of our full quota of $12 million. I doubt whether it wouldgive us much leverage if we were to hold back $6 million for later purchases.Anyhow, if we were to try to exercise such leverage and continue to hold back the $6 million, it would, of course, make a deplorable impression here and forthe reasons given in the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs&apos; telegram it may bedifficult to find another occasion for payment which was equally opportune.
