(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT51C. (62) 205 COPY NO..11 mt---J MT^Decernberj .1962CABINETKATANGAN COPPERMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI was invited by the Cabinet at their meeting on 6th December(C.C. (62) 73rd Conclusions, Minute 2) to circulate, for information,a memorandum about Katangan copper supplies.    The present memorandum considers the effects of a cessation of Katangan suppliesof copper on (a) the world market, (b) the United Kingdom and (c)Northern Rhodesian producers.2.      Free world production of copper in 1961 amounted to4, 030, 000 short tons of which Union Miniere of Katanga accountedfor 320,000 short tons, or about 8 per cent.     The following listgives the 1961 production of the major producers, in short tons:-United States 1,160,000Northern Rhodesia      630,000Chile 600,000Canada 450,000Katanga 320,000Peru 220,000Japan 110,0003.     From 1957 onwards copper has generally been in easy supply,despite the fact that a strike has usually been in progress in one or another of the producing countries.    Since the end of I960, theleading companies of the free world have, more or less systematically,either been making voluntary cuts in production or been withholdingsupplies from the market.    However, in 1961, production exceededconsumption in the free world by about 160,000 tons, although about70, 000 tons were lost in strikes.    At present, the leading producersare making cuts of 10 per cent to 15 per cent (or putting the equivalentinto reserve stocks) and they seem by this means to have achieved a fairly close balance between supply and demand.    As regards price,certain producers (mainly the Northern Rhodesian companies) have,since March, 1961 been engaged in an operation to stabilise theprice of copper on the London Metal Exchange at  234 a ton (a price which corresponds with the ruling price in the United States).     Thishas involved them not only in cutting back production, but in takingsurplus supplies off the market when the price has shown any tendency to weaken.
4.      Against this background, the total loss of Katangan supplies could be made good fairly easily by the restoration of full productionelsewhere and the bringing out of reserve stocks, unless a number of strikes in other producing areas happened to be going on at the sametime.     The market price would of course tend to rise, but unlessthe producers acted irresponsibly and tried to squeeze the market(which on the whole is unlikely), any price rise could be kept within reasonable bounds because of the spare production capacity and reserve stocks in the producers1 hands,5.      Apart from price, the United Kingdom would scarcely beaffected directly;   in 1961 less than 1 per cent of our imports came from Katanga, the main suppliers being:-Northern Rhodesia 48 per centCanada 19 per centChile 18 per centUnited States 9 per cent(Belgium on the other hand would be seriously hit.     The UnionMiniere both refines copper in Katanga and exports blister copperto Belgium for refining there.    Blister copper is generally in short supply and without supplies from Katanga the Belgian refinerieswould probably have to close down. )6.      Setting aside the possibility that developments in the Congomight lead to industrial unrest in the Northern Rhodesian copper-belt (a contingency on which it is not for the Board of Trade to advise),the cessation of Katangan supplies of copper would not seem likely tocreate difficulties for the Northern Rhodesian producers.    On thecontrary, it ought to help them to resume full production in their ownmines, and it would certainly facilitate their market operation to stabilise the price of copper.7.      As regards stockpiles, the United States authorities have142, 000 tons of copper in their stockpiles surplus to strategic require-ments which they might be prepared to release in case of need.F.
