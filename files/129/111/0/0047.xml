Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1962C. (62) 197 Copy No.    g 14th December, 1962CABINETEGYPTIAN COMPENSATION: ASSISTANCE FOR BRITISH NATIONALSDEPRIVED OF THE USE OF THEIR ASSETS IN egypt memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs am submitting to the Cabinet a separate paper (C. (62) 196) on the general question of Egyptian compensation, in which I am asking for grants totalling up to 7-5 million.2. As my colleagues are aware, however, I have for some time considered thata sum of up to  10 million in all (i.e.,  2-5 million more than this) will be required,if the whole question of the obligations of Her Majesty&apos;s Government arising out ofthe Suez incident is to be finally closed. I am asking for this further  2 - 5 million inorder that Her Majesty&apos;s Government may be able to give assistance to an importantgroup of British subjects from Egypt who cannot benefit by any of the other grants;whose case has been strongly pressed in Parliament; and on whose behalf I amcontinuing to receive the strongest representations.3. These are the people who, owing to Suez, were obliged to leave Egypt at amomenfs notice, leaving large assets behind. They regain ownership of these assetsafter desequestration, but they are in fact deprived of the use of them; since, even of those assets which are liquid, they cannot export more than the first  E.5,000.They can sell their non-liquid property, if at all, only at a great loss; and even then the proceeds must remain immobilised in Egypt. They had made their lives in egypt and now cannot return there; many of them have no resources other than the assets which they have had to abandon. They are uprooted; and many are finding it veryhard to make ends meet.4. The case of these people is sui generis, and what I am proposing is not intended to create any kind of precedent. Moreover, they are worse off than thosewho were definitively deprived of their property by &quot; Egyptianization &quot; and whoare receiving compensation in sterling, since their assets, though returned, are useless to them.5. Many schemes for relieving them have been suggested; but most of these would have involved Her Majesty&apos;s Government in taking over liquid or liquidatedassets in Egypt far in excess of the Egyptian currency which our present commitments would allow us to absorb. Loan schemes, as well as possible trade agreements involving currency commitments, have been carefully examined butfound to be open to insuperable objections. The only alternative left is a systemof outright grants.6. I consider it essential on grounds both of policy and equity that somethingshould be done towards relieving the cases of hardship among these people. It is extremely difficult to know how many of them there are. A number have fortunesamounting to over  100,000 frozen in Egypt and have practically no resources in thiscountry. I believe it should be possible to work out a scheme of criteria of comparative hardship which would enable us to give them just and reasonable relief.7. The representatives of these people have been pressing Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to make a very large contribution towards their assistance and have

It is extremely difficult to know how many of them there are. A number have fortunesamounting to over  100,000 frozen in Egypt and have practically no resources in thiscountry. I believe it should be possible to work out a scheme of criteria of comparative hardship which would enable us to give them just and reasonable relief.7. The representatives of these people have been pressing Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to make a very large contribution towards their assistance and have
even suggested sums amounting to over  20 million. This is, of course, outof the question. My proposal is that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should authorisethe expenditure of up to  2-5 million for such relief, and that an independent committee should immediately be created to establish appropriate criteria of comparative hardship and eventually to make suitable grants. As soon as thisCommittee has been set up an announcement should be made that British subjectswho consider that they are suffering hardship because of the blocking of their assets in Egypt may apply for grants. Applications should be made within adefinite time limit ending, say, six months after the creation of the proposed committee. The Committee would consider all the applications, and, in the lightof the material before it, would decide on the best method of making grants.It may well be that, when all the applications have come in, it will be found thatthe deserving cases will not absorb grants amounting to the full sum i am asking for. On the other hand, if the applications should appear to involve grantsexceeding that amount, they would be scaled down by the Committee so that theamount would in any case not be exceeded.8. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury feels some doubt about the advisability of a scheme of this kind. I believe, however, that if it were possiblenow to include this scheme in the statement which will very shortly have to bemade in Parliament, it would go a long way towards disposing of the criticismsto which Her Majesty&apos;s Government are subjected, and towards bringing thiswhole question to a final solution. I therefore ask my colleagues to agree to agrant of up to  2-5 million for this purpose, thus bringing the total commitment of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in this matter to a maximum of  10 million.H.Foreign Office, S.W.1,3rd December, 1962.
