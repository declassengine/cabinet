THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1962C. (62) 167 Copy No. 5125th October, 1962CABINETNYASALAND CONSTITUTIONAL conference memorandum by the First Secretary of state the Conference &quot; to consider further constitutional advance in Nyasaland &quot;,which I agreed upon with Dr. Banda during our discussions in July, is due to openat Marlborough House on the 12th November. In my paper C. (62) 100 of the20th June, 1962, I said that I would be consulting my colleagues nearer the timeabout our objectives at this Conference.Dr. Banda&apos;s Aims2. There is no doubt what Dr. Banda&apos;s objectives will be. He will expecta decision in principle on the secession of Nyasaland from the Federation beforethe Conference starts work (on which I am consulting my colleagues separately).With that issue settled, he will press for a complete constitutional programme, withfixed dates, for Nyasaland&apos;s progression to internal self-government and independence within the Commonwealth, without the need to convene any laterConference. He is probably prepared to contemplate a period of about nine monthsf or working out the detailed arrangements for Nyasaland&apos;s withdrawal from theFederation. He will however expect independence to follow hard on the heels ofthe date of actual secession, and in the meantime an immediate move to full internal self-government. He will probably aim at completion of the whole process by theend of 1963.General Strategy3. Politically and constitutionally, Nyasaland is well set on the road towardsindependence; and, against the pace elsewhere in Africa, the extent to which wecan hope to apply the brake in the remaining stages is extremely limited. It wouldbe wise to have mid-1964 in our minds as the target date. On the other hand, whileavoiding a political breach, we must seek to gain all the time we can in which tobring Malawi Ministers to realistic examination and negotiation of the very serious economic, financial and administrative problems which they must face if Nyasalandis to function as an independent State. Only thus can Nyasaland be led to independence in conditions which constitute an honourable and orderly dischargeof our responsibilities as protecting Power.4. I suggest therefore that our strategy in the forthcoming negotiations both at the Conference and afterwards should be to give Dr. Banda the firm impression that we broadly accept his views on the general pattern of future progress: but,to make clear that, in working out that pattern, the pace and manner must besubject to realistic assessment by Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the NyasalandGovernment of all the factors on which the ability of the territory to stand on itsown feet depends. We should seek to demonstrate that the decision on secession(assuming my colleagues accept my views on this) means that there is a great dealof hard thinking and hard work to be done before comprehensive conclusions canbe reached about Nyasaland&apos;s future as an independent State.Self - Government5. I said in my paper C. (62) 100 that by agreeing to a constitutional conference this autumn we should be virtually committing ourselves to theintroduction of internal self-government in Nyaraland at an early date in 1963.
I think this must now be accepted as our purpose, and I would propose to workfor a self-governing Constitution on the normal pattern, subject however to suchlimitations as I can succeed in negotiating on two important issues in particular.6. First, it is clearly undesirable that we should give up all control overinternal financial matters before the economic and financial aspects of Nyasaland&apos;sdetachment from the Federation have been worked out. (I hope of course that before that stage is reached there will be opportunity also to reopen the possibilityof maintaining some links between Nyasaland and the Rhodesias). Since Nyasalandis grant-aided, we can exercise considerable control in practice. But, in the next stage of advance at least, we should try also to retain some constitutional control.Fortunately, there appears to be some prospect of Dr. Banda&apos;s agreeing to theretention, possibly into 1964, of an expatriate official as Minister of Finance. Theretention by the Governor of formal reserve powers in financial matters mayhowever be a more difficult matter to negotiate.7. Secondly, it is necessary for the Governor to retain some measure ofresponsibility in respect of the civil service. If full responsibility were to betransferred to local Ministers, we should be bound to offer a full-scale &quot; voluntaryretirement&quot; compensation scheme to expatriate officers. The result would undoubtedly be a large-scale exodus, which would involve a grave risk of administrative breakdown. This is going to be a difficult issue, as Dr. Bandais known to attach great importance to securing control of the service.8. It will also be my objective to retain adequate powers in the Governor^hands in respect of the police and internal security. I propose to insist upon theintroduction of a Bill of Rights as a protection for individuals belonging to minority communities.Independence9. There are very obvious arguments against promising Dr. Banda a firmdate for independence at this Conference. To do so before the broader Federalissues are further resolved would clearly increase the African pressures in northern rhodesia, and make it more difficult to carry the Federal Government with us overthe next few months. It might also lead to repercussions in Southern Rhodesia.So far as Nyasaland herself is concerned, there are obvious disadvantages incommitting ourselves to a specific date for independence before the mainconsequences of Nyasaland&apos;s withdrawal from the Federation have been worked out.10. I would therefore seek to persuade Dr. Banda that it is unrealistic to expect Her Majesty&apos;s Government to give a firm date for independence at thisstage. He will however press me hard on this and, if it were to become a breaking-point with him, I might have to consider giving him some assurance, in private atleast, that Her Majesty&apos;s Government are thinking in terms of mid-1964 for thecompletion of the whole process.Conclusions11.   I therefore seek the agreement of my colleagues(a) that I should negotiate with Dr. Banda at the Conference on the broadbasis of accepting his aspirations for the future progress of Nyasalandto self-government and independence, but seeking to secure as orderly and stable a transition of power as possible, by emphasising her majesty&apos;s Government^ need to be satisfied regarding the conditionsin which constitutional advance will take place before relinquishing its responsibilities;(b) that internal self-government should be conceded next year subject to suchlimitations as I am able to negotiate in the fields of finance and thecivil service in particular;(c) that we should, if possible, avoid any commitments on the date of independence (though some private assurance at least to Dr. Bandamay be necessary).R. A. B.Office of the First Secretary of State, S.W.1,,    24th October, 1962.
