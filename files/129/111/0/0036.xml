C. (62)18619th November^ 19,62CABINETGENERAL GRANTSMemorandum by the Chief Secretary to the treasury in the paper which the Minister of Housing and I circulated tothe Cabinet (C.(62) 171) it was proposed that General Grant should befixed at  547 million and  574 million in 1963-64 and 1964-65respectively;  following his consultations with the local authorities theMinister now proposes that Grant should be fixed at  562 million and 589 million -  15 million higher in each year.2. No new arguments were adduced at the consultation;  buthe states that objection was taken more vehemently than had been expected to our taking into account other grant income when fixingGeneral Grant.    We have, of course, always intended to take otherincome generally and Rate Deficiency Grant in particular into account;if we do not the grant system is entirely open-ended.     If we give wayon this point, we have for the future no effective way of protecting theExchequer.3. This the Minister concedes, and suggests it might be met bynegotiating a revised Rate Deficiency Grant, to come into effect theyear after next.     I cannot believe that this will work unless somestimulus to agreement is provided;   we risk finding that the objectionsto reducing the Rate Deficiency Grant, taken by itself, are just asvehemently urged;  particularly damaging could be the charge thatwe should be throwing an extra burden on householders in the poorerareas.4. There is a way, however, in which this might be made towork.    If we keep the General Grant at the level we at present propose,and promise to restore to the authorities, via the General Grant, in1963-4, any money saved by altering the Rate Deficiency Grant, weshould enter negotiations with some hope of success and the legisla-tion Would be much less, Controversial in Parliament.     If it were passed at the beginning of next session, it would still be possible toincrease the General Grant by Order before the end of 1963-64.Increase Orders have been used in the past to change General Grantretrospectively in this way;  and Rate Deficiency Grant is regularlyaltered retrospectively to take account of changes in expenditure during the year.    I would add that the  15 million at issue is only about lj per cent of total rates and I cannot believe that authoritiesCOPY NO.
will be seriously hampered in the development of essential servicesbecause of the sum of money equivalent in the new values to rather less than a 2d. rate is being withheld temporarily pending clearing up of the Rate Deficiency Grant position.5. The choices before us appear to be:-*(a)    To concede the local authorities&apos; demands in full.     Thiswould involve not only an increase of  78 million on this year&apos;s budget for England and Wales, but more also for Scotland and more still for1964-65.    It would also leave us completely at risk on the open-ended commitment which the Rate Deficiency Grant system would haveshown itself to be.     This would be a disastrous course,(b) To leave the figure for General Grant in the order whichwe must now present to Parliament as originally agreed between theMinister of Housing and myself.     But to tell the local authorities thatwe propose to legislate to amend the General Grant provisions, andthat an additional order will be made before the end of 1963-64,increasing the General Grant for that year to take full account of savings resulting from the Rate Deficiency Grant amendment.     Thiswould involve legislation either this session or next.    It would bean important part of this package to attempt to negotiate it now withthe local authorities, whose attitude would appear from the Ministerof Housirig&apos;s paper (C. (62) 183) likely to be not unhelpful.(c) To postpone the coming into effect of the new valuationsand the re-rating of industry.    As the increase in Rate DeficiencyGrant springs directly from this revaluation and re-rating, thefinancial problem would be resolved and time given for furtherconsideration of the working of the Rate Deficiency Grant system.There might also be other attractions in this course.(d) To face the local authority associations&apos; objections and maintain the proposal put forward by the Minister of Housing and myself in C. (62) 171.     The local authority associations are in the topleague as pressure groups, and it may well be that if the localauthorities themselves saw that we were in earnest they would not look too closely at &quot;a gift horse&quot; which after ail would in any event beproviding for them an increase of  65 million a year from central funds.    The case as argued in our joint paper is a strong one on merits, and it would not be plausible to argue that  13 million had very much to do with the level of rates involved in the local authority expenditure of over  1, 800 million.    If we decided to take this line i think a small upward adjustment would take account of the Ministerof Health&apos;s difficulty.J.A.B,-C.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.19th November, 1962.-2-
