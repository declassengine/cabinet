BroadcastingDRAFT WHITE PAPER

1753B*BROADCASTINGDRAFT WHITE paper. In its previous White Paper on Broadcasting (Memorandum on theReport of the Committee on Broadcasting, 1960, Cmnd. 1770) theGovernment set out its first series of proposals for the future of broadcasting and television. These included a second B.B.C. programme on 625 lines inthe Ultra High Frequency bands and some colour television; improvements in the present 405-line television services in Scotland, Wales and elsewhere;a more liberal allocation of hours for sound broadcasting; and more hours in television for programmes of education for adults. By these and other changes the Government sought to give the public a more rewarding choice of services, to keep abreast with technical progress, and to encouragepotential exports. These decisions have met with a very general measureof public approval.2. The remaining questions in particular the future of independent television, local sound broadcasting and pay-television are much morecontentious. The Government thought it right to reserve its views on these important matters in order to allow time for further consideration in thelight of public opinion.3. In the event, widely differing opinions have been expressed both- inParliament and in public. The Government, after taking account of thesediverse views, has now reached its own conclusions. These are set out inthis White Paper, together with comments on a number of other issues.Independent Television4. The Committee on Broadcasting proposed that the independent television Authority should sell the advertising time and purchase the programmes from companies supplying them under contract. As theprevious White Paper explained, the Committee&apos;s main argument was that,in the context of the present structure, it is impossible fully to reconcile thecommercial purpose of the companies with the realisation of the &quot; purposesof broadcasting&quot;. The Government does not discount the evidence ofdisquiet with certain aspects of independent television, although it considersthat some of the criticisms were exaggerated by witnesses while othersapply equally to the B.B.C. But the Government does not consider thisjustifies the Committee&apos;s opinion that independent television suffers from astructural defect calling for the radical change they recommend, and thatthe faults, such as they are, could not be remedied by less drastic measuresthan the proposals recommended by the Committee. In any case, althoughthe Committee&apos;s system would have the merit of simplicity, it is a matter for speculation how it would work in practice. Some feel that the tendency of the Committee&apos;s proposals wOuld be to produce not better television,but more expensive and more lavish programmes. They doubt whethersufficient scope would remain for originality and enterprise among the3
programme companies, since the initiative would pass into the hands of the monopoly buyer of programmes. Others dislike the prospect of a centralisedsystem which they claim would be an inferior edition of the B.B.C., whoseuniform structure it would lack.5. These doubts about the justification for the Committee&apos;s proposal,and its practical consequences, have led the Government to decide not toaccept it. In the Governmenfs view the achievements of the existing systemare such as to justify its continuance, although it recognises that a numberof improvements are required. The Government has, therefore, consideredthe merits and demerits of the present system with a view to taking advantageof the former and eliminating the latter.6. The system created by the Authority since 1954 rests on four large programme contracts which, between them, cover the three main areas of population London, the Midlands, and Lancashire and Yorkshire and anumber of regional contracts, some of medium size, others quite small.7. Any television system must be constructed on one or more units ofconsiderable size, possessing the financial resources, the studios, the outsidebroadcast and other equipment, as well as the staff and professionalexpertise, to produce the expensive and often specialised programmes whicha national television system demands.8. Most of the programmes seen on independent television are produced by the four companies which hold the large contracts. Many are good-quality, popular programmes. The regional companies produce several hours a week of programmes specially designed for their own areas, and in additionsome have produced programmes which have been shown on the nationalnetwork.9. It would be contrary to the interests of good television for largecontracts to disappear or to be appreciably diminished in size. This,however, is not to say that the companies to whom these contractsmay be awarded should dominate the system and should themselves decide what viewers everywhere should be able to see. The present system has developed a defect in the tight control exercised by the larger companiesover networking in general; and the financial arrangements between these companies and the regional ones positively discourage the production oforiginal programmes by the regional companies, which pay for programmesbought from the big companies on a basis which does not vary in proportion to the number of programmes they buy.10. It is desirable to eliminate this feature and to replace it by a genuinesystem of &quot; free trade &quot; in programmes to allow all programmes to be boughtand sold freely on their merits. In the Governmenfs view this should encourage good and lively television, composed perhaps more than now ofcontributions from programme companies of differing outlook andpersonality.11. The Government proposes that the control of networking shouldpass to the Authority, which should generally take a much more positive role in the affairs of independent television. The Authority will chair a committeerepresenting all the programme companies.    It will also approve and4
supervise the arrangements for the buying and selling of networkprogrammes, so that this may operate in a manner which is helpful to-allcompanies alike, large and small. Moreover, it will be responsible- forthe shape, content, balance and quality of the service as a whole. t12. The Government considers that the system of free trade in programmes, carried on under the general supervision of the Authority,should produce a service of properly balanced and good quality television.The Government proposes, in addition, that the Authority should be givenreserve powers to nominate programmes for the network to guard againstthe contingency that the new system may not produce the results expected of it.13. The Government also proposes that after 1964 programme contracts should be allocated for not more than three years at a time, although theywould be renewable.14. In future, therefore, the Authority, suitably equipped, will take acommanding position in the affairs of independent television. Theprogramme companies will maintain their individuality; they will beresponsible for producing the programmes and for collecting the advertisingrevenue, and will enjoy contracts which will be reviewed at least every threeyears. Programmes should achieve their position on the network throughquality and merit, and if quality failed to measure up to promise then the renewal of contracts would be in peril.15. Enterprise and variety would be encouraged by putting an end tothe over-powerful position of the present &quot; network&quot; companies, and by giving the smaller regional companies the opportunity to provide programmes for the network.16. The Government is confident that the combination of public and private elements in independent television has great, potentialities. It believes that the Authority and the programme companies will justify this confidence.17. The Government will presently bring forward for the considerationof Parliament a Television Bill embodying these changes.Advisory Committees18. The Television Act, 1954, provides that the Authority must set upthree Advisory Committees, and that it must comply with their advice.These Committees are the Advertising Advisory Committee, the ReligiousAdvisory Committee, and the Children&apos;s and Young Persons AdvisoryCommittee. The Government reserved its view on the recommendations ofthe Committee on Broadcasting in regard to these Committees (paragraph 17of Cmnd. 1770). The Committee recommended that the Authority shouldnot in the future be required by statute to comply with the advice of itsadvisory committees. The Government accepts this recommendation. TheCommittee also thought it unnecessary to continue to require the Authorityby statute to set up advisory committees. The Government takes the viewthat there is merit in continuing to provide in the Act for Committees whichare clearly necessary. It considers that there should be two Committees,as now, for advertising and religion respectively, and a third to advise on
broadcasts intended for reception by schools or other educational establish-ments, and to offer advice in particular on policy and planning. It will clearly fulfil part of the function of the present Children&apos;s Committee (whichadvises only in regard to programmes intended for children and youngpersons) and the latter may no longer be required or may need to be changed.The Government does not therefore propose to make its continuance an obligation on the Authority. It will in any case be part of the Authority^general duty to consider the nature of programmes for children, as well as toconsider the effect of other programmes on children when large numbersmay be expected to be viewing. The Government is assured that theAuthority would itself wish to have the three Advisory Committees whichit is proposed should be statutory.19. The Committee on Broadcasting recommended that the authority should have a statutory duty to set up a General Advisory Council. TheGovernment prefers to leave the decision whether or not to establish one for the Authority to take in the light of experience of its new and enlargedfunctions. It is proposed to provide in the Television Bill for the Authorityto have power to establish such a Council.Second I.T.A. Programme20. In Cmnd. 1770 the Government deferred a decision on the timetableand shape of a second I.T.A. programme, while expressing the view thatthere would be scope for one at a later stage. There is little evidence ofa public demand for this. Furthermore the financial prospects of independent television may be less assured after 1964, when the existence ofthree television programmes instead of two will create more competition.The Government is not at present satisfied that in such a situation sufficientadvertising revenue would be forthcoming adequately to sustain twocommercial programmes. The Government still feels, however, that a secondcommercial programme may prove to be desirable in order to allow fullscope to independent television to offer more selection to viewers and toexperiment. While the Government does not propose to authorise a secondindependent television programme in the near future, it does not dismissthe possibility of doing so later.Press Representation21. The Committee on Broadcasting recommended that the Pressinterest in a programme company should not be dominant. By this theymeant that a Press interest should not be the largest single interest. Theydid not, however, recommend a complete bar to such participation. they recognised that, with the statutory bar on the expression of editorial views and the statutory duty to treat controversy impartially, the risk of bias orinsufficiency of treatment of affairs of public concern on television was small,but said that the suspicion of too great a concentration in too few handsof the power to influence and persuade could not be dismissed by the argument that the power had not been used and was not very likely to beused. The Royal Commission on the Press recommended, within their terms of reference, that programme contractors should not be controlled by newspaper undertakings.6;
22. The Government agrees that the situation does not call for completeprohibition of Press participation. It also agrees that there should be adequate safeguards against any possible risks as a result of undueconcentration of share-holdings. It is true that the practical results of Pressparticipation in independent television have given little cause for anxietyso far, and any latent dangers there may be in the situation are likely to beeven less, given the Government^ intention to strengthen the general powersof control of the Authority itself. There is, nevertheless, a body of opinion which feels it is undesirable in principle for control of the media ofcommunication to be unnecessarily concentrated.23. The recommendation of the Committee on Broadcasting would meanfixing definite maximum percentages of Press-held voting shares in respectof each individual contract. The Authority already takes power, under its existing contracts, to control the transfer of voting shares in programme companies; but definition of control or dominant interest, in the sense thatthe Press should not be the largest single interest in a programme company,would mean that the size of Press holdings might frequently need to be variedby reference to extraneous factors. For example, a Press holding whichinitially was not the largest single interest might become so as a result of changes in other and unconnected shareholdings. Moreover, if an arbitrarylimit were fixed, for example, the holding of a certain percentage of the voting shares, it would not follow that effective control of a company wouldbe prevented by this means, since the degree of control exercised in each casedepends on the disposition of the remaining voting shares.24. The Governmenfs provisional view is that the problem can best,be dealt with in the Bill by directing the Authority to take power in itscontracts to suspend or cancel the contract of a company should newspaperholdings give rise to abuse. The Authority will be required, beforeexercising this power, to obtain the agreement of the Postmaster-General.The Authority might wish to be assisted by some body of individualsindependent of the management of the companies and appointed with the function of advising the Authority on any aspect of the conduct of a Pressinterest in a company. In addition, the Government proposes that thePostmaster-General should be given a reserve power to direct the Authorityto suspend or cancel a contract in similar circumstances, any such powerbeing exercisable by Statutory Instrument subject to affirmative resolution in both Houses of Parliament.25. Pending further discussion in Parliament, the view of the Governmentis that, given these safeguards against the possibility of abuse in the future,direct restrictions upon Press holdings in programme companies areunnecessary.Identity of Programme Companies26. The Government considers that the I.T.A. contracts should includesuch provisions as are necessary in order to ensure that the programmecompany granted a contract retains its basic original identity andcharacteristics, and that control is not so changed that the. IT.A. would7
not, if the change had occurred previously to the grant of the contract, haveallocated it to the company. This statutory duty will be placed on theI.T.A.Profits.27. The profits of the programme contractors may decline after 1964.But they are still likely to be substantial, at any rate in the larger areas,while there is only one commercial programme. The Government will include in the Television Bill a specific provision to ensure that adequaterentals are paid by the companies, which will include a substantial paymentcalculated by reference to the profits of the companies before tax. Thispayment will be made to the Authority and then remitted to the Exchequer.The Government considers this to be the simplest and most effective methodof securing economic rentals for the valuable concessions which thecompanies enjoy. In agreeing the arrangements to flow from this decision the differing financial circumstances within the industry will be taken intoaccount.Independent Television News28. The Bill will provide that the Authority should ensure that thetime given to news in its programmes is sufficient, and that adequatefinancial arrangements are made to enable the company to carry out its functions, which include the provision of other types of informationprogrammes. The appointment of the Editor of I.T.N. is at present approved by the Authority.   This will continue.Television Advertising29. The various aspects of television advertising referred to in cmnd. 1770, paragraphs 65 and 66, have been discussed with the Authority.30. The Advertising Advisory Committee of the Authority will be strengthened in its general consumer representation. The Committee on broadcasting referred to the attendance of observers as well as representatives from advertising organisations at meetings of the Advertising AdvisoryCommittee. Any observers who are asked to attend such meetings will not do so as of right; their sole function will be to assist the Committee withtheir expert knowledge and to form a practical link between the Committeeand their own organisations.&apos;31. The Authority will consult with the Consumer Council when it is appointed.32. The setting up of an Advertising Standards Authority by the advertising industry is , evidence of its responsible attitude and of its intention to cultivate good standards of advertising in all media. The I.T.A.will consult with this Authority, and any other external advisory bodiesthat may from time to time be appointed, as to the most effective meansof co-operation.33. The Authority has invited its Advisory Committee to review thePrinciples for Television Advertising and to consider amplifying thePrinciples, for the additional guidance of advertisers, by the inclusion of8
more detailed rules based on &quot; case-law &quot; and practice over the years. TheAuthority lightly recognises that practice in other advertising media is notnecessarily appropriate to television, where standards may need to be moreexacting; that the onus of proof of claims made in advertisements must always rest on the advertiser; and if there is any reasonable doubt theviewers&apos; interests must come first.34. In relation to advertisements in children&apos;s programmes, and the part played by children in advertisements, the Principles for Television Advertisingstate that:&quot;No product or service may be advertised and no method of advertising may be used, in association with a programme intended for&apos; children or which large numbers of children are likely to see, whichmight result in harm to them physically, mentally and morally, and nomethod of advertising may be employed which takes advantage of thenatural credulity and sense of loyalty in children; &quot;.Particular restrictions on advertising in relation to its effect on children arespecified. In practice the Principles have been strictly interpreted, and ithas been insisted that children should not be shown in advertisements insituations that are likely to lead young viewers into undesirable emulationand that children in advertisements should be seen, within reason, to be wellbehaved. In its review of the Principles the Advisory Committee has been invited to amplify the rules in these respects and to make it clear that noadvertisements in children&apos;s programmes should give undue emphasis to free gifts and competitions.35.   In addition to this review of Principles the Authority will assume a.more formal and direct control of the executive decisions after the inspection of advertisements and is now considering how this can best be done.36. Discussions have taken place with the Authority on the distributionof advertisements, their presentation in natural breaks, and the tone andstyle of some advertisements in relation to programmes. On the averagethere are three advertising intervals in an hour. To specify a long minimum period between advertising intervals would make programming moreinflexible, without necessarily reducing the number of advertising intervals.The Television Bill will give the Authority the power to regulate practicewith regard to advertising and natural breaks. Meanwhile the Authority willcontinue to examine the distribution and presentation of advertisementsbetween programmes and in natural breaks, and will also act to avoidstridency and undue repetitiveness in advertisements.37. The Postmaster-General has issued a direction under Section 4 (5)of the Television Act that advertising magazines should be excluded fromthe Authority&apos;s transmissions after 31st March, 1963. This allows areasonable period for the rundown of existing commitments.Programme Standards38. Discussions have taken place with both the B.B.C. and the I.T.A.on programme standards. The Government is seriously concerned toprevent the danger not only of excessive violence, but also of excessivetriviality in the treatment of programmes.   In the last resort these are9
matters which must depend on the vigilance of the broadcasting authorities.Prescription by legislation of detailed programme standards would be ineffective. The Government, nevertheless, considers that codes of standards and practice in programmes, issued by the broadcasting authorities themselves, are valuable, not least in focusing the attention of producers onthe need for care, and it expects the broadcasting authorities to make themost effective use of them. Written codes are better adapted to dealingwith recognisable incidents in programmes, such as acts of violence, than with the essential spirit underlying production. For current affairs anddocumentary programmes in particular, the aim must be to provide interestingand satisfying programmes which are neither superficial nor sensational.Both broadcasting authorities recognise the problems here and have assured the Postmaster-General that they will do all they can to surmount them.39. The Television Act, 1954, provides that proper proportions of therecorded and other matter in programmes are of British origin and ofBritish performance. This provision will continue, and the Governmentlooks to the B.B.C. and the I.T.A. also to ensure that proper proportions of programmes are designed to appeal especially to the tastes and outlookof the audience in the United Kingdom.40. There has been criticism of the lack of co-ordination between thetwo existing programmes, sometimes leading to similar types of programmesbeing shown on both channels at the same time. When this happens thosewho do not like the type of programme offered are deprived of any alternative; while equally those who like the programmes sufficiently towant to watch both cannot do so. Co-ordination over programmes as awhole, however, would lead to a measure of joint planning which, even ifit were feasible, would undermine the benefits of competition. nevertheless the Government has told the two broadcasting authorities that they should consist-operate as far as possible in respect of programmes where competition isinappropriate namely, educational programmes, religious and Welsh orGaelic language programmes. Discussions have also taken place with theB.B.C. on their attitude to their own programming on two televisionnetworks, and they have assured the Postmaster-General that at all times thetwo programmes will be genuinely complementary, and will offer a realchoice of selection; each channel being at the same time comprehensive inits scope.Local Sound Broadcasting41. Further consideration has confirmed the Government in its viewthat this development should not command a high priority in the allocation of national resources, though it does not discount a possible latent demandfor local sound services. It will later review the situation in the lightof the other developments in broadcasting dealt with in this and the previous white Paper.Television for Public Showing42. The Governments tentative view, as set out in the previous white paper, was that there may be a place for the televising of programmes orevents on a big screen in places where people would pay to see them.  The10
would last for some two to three years; there would be no guarantee thaton the conclusion of the experiment the Government would authorise ageneral or permanent pay-television service.47. The experiment will in any area cater for one pay-television programme only, but wire networks used in the experiment must also make available B.B.C. and I.T.A. programmes, including the second B.B.C. servicewhen it is transmitted. No advertisements will be allowed. The financing of such surveys and returns as the Postmaster-General requires must beborne by the operator. The control of the experimental arrangements willbe exercised by the Post Office who may be assisted by an Advisory group of other official and independent members.48. If there are a number of acceptable organisations wishing toparticipate in the experiment they may be required to combine in one ormore consortiums. An announcement will presently be made invitinginterested organisations to apply. In view of the time needed to mount anyexperiment it is unlikely to start before 1964.12
