THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC&apos;MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1949CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.&apos; 3 1CP. (49) 31l$th February, 1949CABINETPARLIAMENTARY SECRETARIESNote by the Prime MinisterCONSTITUTIONALLY, a Parliamentary Secretary is not &quot; a Ministerof the Crown &quot;; he is appointed by the Minister whom he serves, not by the King.*It is true that by modern practice Parliamentary Secretaries are selected by thePrime Minister and that their appointments are, as a matter of courtesy, formallysubmitted to the King. This does not, however, affect their constitutional position.The powers on which the administration of a Department depends are the powersof the Minister. It is the Minister alone who is answerable to Parliament for theexercise of those powers. Day-to-day decisions are taken on the Minister&apos;s behalfby virtue of the delegation of his authority (either express or implied) to agentswho act in his name. In this respect there is no difference between a Parlia-mentary Secretary and an ^ official-; both, equally, are exercising the Minister&apos;spowers on his behalf;2. Historically, it was the primary duty of a Parliamentary Secretary toassist his Minister in Parliament, or to represent him there when he was absent.This still remains an important part of his duties, but, by modern practice, theParliamentary Secretary is by no means restricted to Parliamentary work; inrecent years he has played a large and increasing part in helping the Minister withthe administrative work of the Department. The way in which this help can best be given is a matter for arrangement between a Minister and his Parlia-mentary Secretary. Where a Minister is in the Lords, and the parliamentary secretary has to answer for him in the Commons over the whole range of theDepartments work, it will be necessary that the Parliamentary Secretary shouldinterest himself in the work of the Department as a whole. Where the Minister isin the Commons, he may find it more convenient to ask the Parliamentary Secretary-* Anson : &quot;Law and Custom of the Constitution,&quot; Volume II, Part 1^ pp. 223-224 :  andErskine May (XTVth Edition), p. 202.- 36580
to concentrate on particular aspects of the Departments work and may delegate tohim the responsibility for supervising the day-to-day administration of certain branches. Thus, in the Service Departments, the Junior Ministers have definedresponsibilities for specified subjects, as Members of Council; and in otherDepartments where there is more than one Parliamentary Secretary there is a clearallocation of duties between them.3. In the administrative work of the Department a Parliamentary Secretarycan relieve the Minister of much of the work which would otherwise coine to him;and he is specially qualified to see that due weight is given to Parliamentary and&apos;political considerations in the execution of approved policy. Full use should alsobe made of the advice and assistance which Parliamentary Secretaries can give inthe formulation of policy. They are on occasion asked to represent their ministers at Cabinet Committees; but I should like to feel assured that Ministersbring them fully into their counsels in the formulation of policy within theDepartments. Apart from the current assistance which they can give in theseways to busy Ministers, it should not be forgotten that it is by experience in thisoffice that they hope to fit themselves for higher responsibilities.4. The assignment of duties to the Parliamentary Secretary is thus a matter,for the Minister to decide and will vary from one Department to another. In thedischarge of their duties, however, Parliamentary Secretaries should not lose sight of the fact that they have no powers save by delegation from the Minister, and special attention should be paid to the following points : (a) Although a Parliamentary Secretary may be authorised to supervise theday-to-day administration of specified subjects, this arrangement can-not relieve the Minister of his ultimate responsibility for policy. nor can it relieve the Permanent Secretary ot his general responsibilityfor the organisation and discipline of the Department or of his duty&apos; to advise on matters of policy. The Minister is entitled to look to asingle person who can advise him on policy over the whole range of theDepartments work, and that duty must be discharged by thePermanent Secretary.(6) The Parliamentary Secretary, not being part of the official hierarchy ofthe Department, is not subject to the directions of the permanent secretary. But equally, the Permanent Secretary is not subjectto the directions of the Parliamentary Secretary. It follows thatany conflict of view between the two can only be resolved by referenceto the Minister.       &apos;.&apos;/.&apos; .(c) The Permanent Secretary will wish from time to time to refer papers tothe Parliamentary Secretary, or to submit them to the Minister throughhim, particularly if they raise Parliamentary or political considera-tions. But it follows from what has been said above that on theseoccasions the Parliamentary Secretary will not be at liberty to makea final decision contrary to the recommendation made by the permanent secretary. If he finds himself in disagreement with that recommen-&apos;dation, he will normally discuss the matter with the Permanent
Secretary. If, after discussion, the issue is resolved by agreement, anote to this effect should be placed on record in the papers. If,however, there remains a conflict of view between them, the issue mustbe submitted for decision by the Minister; and the parliamentary secretary should normally take the initiative in submitting it.(d) When the Minister is away, the Permanent Secretary may seek theadvice of the Parliamentary Secretary on the political and Parlia-mentary aspects of any question which would normally have beensubmitted to the Minister. If there should be any conflict of view between them, the final decision should be postponed until theDepartmental Minister is available or, if postponement is undesirable,the question should be submitted for decision by another Minister.Matters of major policy should in any event be referred to theMinister deputed to act for this purpose during the absence of theDepartmental Minister.- C. R. A.10, Downing Street, S.W.1,lQth February, 1949.
