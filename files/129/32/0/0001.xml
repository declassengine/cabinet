THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY QF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT ^,. .     r Printed for the Cabinet. x. January-1$^-;.&apos;t:v-X-secret .&quot;. t::&quot;::;^ 26CP. (49) 1     S$th January, 1949CABINETCENSUS OF DISTRIBUTION ,Memorandum by the President of the Board: of trade at their meeting on 22nd December, 1948 (CM. (48) 82nd Conclusion,Minute 4), the Cabinet invited me to prepare a paper, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer arid the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,dealing with :-(i) the questions which small shopkeepers will be expected to answer^(ii) the extent to which policy could be framed without waiting for theresults of the Census.2. Part I of this memorandum describes, the information (which has beenreduced to the bare minimum) we propose to collect from small traders. /Jv3&quot;. Part II argues that although plans are being madeJo take direct action,in a number of limited fields, no detailed and informed general policy can be formulated to cover the ordinary run of consumer goods until we have the resultsof the Census, and that the taking of the Census is itselfan important part of distribution policy. &apos;4. This paper has been agreed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It hasalso been seen by the Chancellor of the Duchy of. Lancaster,who is, I understand,submitting a separate paper. -&apos;/../ part I.-The Forms5. It is proposed to cover the following sections of the distributive and service trades at the 1949 Census : Retailers, food and non-food, including pawnbrokers, market traders andmail order houses.Restaurants, caf^s, snack bars, &amp;c. i.e., the nonrresidential caterers,hut not public houses, hotels or boarding houses.Motor dealers and garages.Certain service trades, the main ones being hairdressers, photographersand undertakers,Repairers working for the public, e.g:; shoe repairers, watch repairers,cycle repairers.Wholesalers, importers and exporters, including brokers and agentsassociated with the wholesale trades.6. The Advisory Committee set up last July under the provisions of the statistics of Trade Act has been at great pains to prepare forms which will besimple for the small trader, who should be able to answer them by reference tothe records he normally needs to keep for income tax or P.A.Y.E. purposes. Theseforms have been generally accepted by trade associations as reasonable and therehave been very few complaints that the small shopkeeper would have difficultynv giving the information; indeed, the National Chamber of Trade have saidiBtormauy, that tney do not regard the forms as causing traders any particular36389
difficulty. The information required relates to the calendar year 1949.. withthe exception of questions on employment and wages; traders who would find itdifficult &quot;to give figures for the calendar year because their business year differs from this may make their return for their business year ending between5th April, 1949, and 6th April, 1950. The questions asked of the smaller.retailers, with a turnover up to  5,000 for 1949, are (a copy of the form isattached) : &quot;Name and Address:   .    : .Description of Business :.e.g., grocer, ironmonger (no figures).Method of Trading: e.g., shop, market trader, credit trader, milk depot(no figures).Services Provided: A description of any services provided, such as hair-,       dressing, watch repairing (no figures).Sales and Charges for Services: Total turnover for the year sub-divided intosales of goods, sales of meals and receipts from services.Purchases: For the year.Stocks: At the beginning and end of the year.Persons Working in the Business: In one week in the year. Proprietors and paid employees sub-divided to show full-time and part-time Workers,males and females, with a further division of paid employees into those over and under 18 years. &apos;.Wages: Of paid employees for the same week as employment figures and also for the whole year.Delivery: Asking whether or not the trader makes a regular practice ofdelivering goods to customers (no figures).Goods Sold: A short description of the main classes of goods sold by theretailer (no figures).The main additional information required of larger retailers who will often behandling a wider range of goods is a division of their total receipts between the broad classes of goods which they are handling, e.g., groceries, ironmongery.*7. The programme which has been worked out for the Census involves theissue of forms to traders early in January, 1950, for completion by the end ofMarch (with an extension for traders making a return for a business year endinglater than 31st December, 1949); reminder letters would be sent out early inApril to those traders whose returns were overdue and repeated as necessary,until a sufficient response had been obtained to permit the summarising of returns,but prosecutions for failure to make returns would not be likely to commencebefore July and would then be applied only to a limited number of cases. Therehas been pressure from Trade Associations to allow traders a longer period inwhich to complete returns and there might be less opposition in 1950 if theywere given until the end of May or June; such a concession would, however,delay the publication of Census results probably until early 1952. In view ofthe political repercussions of the Census, however, the Board of Trade wouldbe prepared to give this extra time, and in any case to ensure that no stiff follow-up action was taken in respect of unreturned forms, for some time.Part II. Distribution Policy and the Census8. The broad lines of a policy for the distribution of food were decided by the Lord Presidents Committee (L.P. (48) 14th Meeting, Minute-1) when they accepted the recommendations of the Food Distribution Committee (L.P. (48).71).These were, in. brief: &quot; (i) That in the retail food trade the aim should be complete freedom of competition.(ii) That the Ministry of Food should work out proposals for nationalisingappropriate sections of the wholesale food trades,(iii) That preparation should be made for improving the marketing of fruit,vegetables and certain other agricultural products:9. In addition, the Ministry of. Food is sponsoring an experiment designedto test the possibilities of &quot; self -service-&apos;&apos;\;meth(^s of ..diMribution, &quot;which; aregenerally suitable only for food products.
10. action is being taken in connection with the distribution of certain otherspecialised products. The Ministry of Works is taking steps-by the review ofmargins and by reference to the Monopolies Commission-to improve the methodsof distributing building materials on the lines recommended by the Simon Com-mittee set up by the Minister of Works. At the same time, the National coal board is attempting by direct efforts to simplify the wholesale distribution of coalW, ,--0------- .......11. As a more general measure I have appointed a committee to inquire into resale price maintenance. This Committee is expected to report in March,1949, and it will be open to my Department to refer to the Monopolies Com-mission any restrictions which the Committee finds to be acting as obstacles tothe improvement of efficiency in the distributive trades. In general the programmeof investigations planned for the Monopolies Commission should throw up as aby-product a good deal of useful information about the distribution of particularproducts and may lead to the removal of obstacles to efficiency.12. The Board of Trade has reviewed a wide range of distributors&apos; marginsduring the past year, and reductions have been made in many cases, and will soon be made in others, including footwear, pottery and dome non-utility fabrics. Inthe case of other goods where current margins are not   being lowered, there werereductions at the time when the subsidies on cotton and wool cloth Were removed.13. It will be seen, therefore, that certain steps are already being taken which, when added together, may have a significant effect on the distribution of consumer goods in this country. These measures are already being prepared and will be unaffected by any decisions taken about the date 6f the Census.14. A long series of reports into the distribution of primary productsculminating in the reports of the Lucas Committee on the Agricultural MarketingActs, the Williams Committee on Milk Distribution, the Food Policy working party and the Jay Committee on Food Distribution already exists as a basis for action in connection with these products. Moreover, enough is no doubt known about such highly organised trades as cold storage and grain milling to make it possible to take informed action in advance of a Census.15. No such body of information exists for the ordinary run of consumer goods, and not enough is known about the channels through which, and themethods by which, these goods are distributed, to enable departments to say with confidence which are the weak spots in distribution (let alone whac is the most appropriate type of action to be taken) nor except perhaps against a back-ground of comprehensive statistics^ are those trades suitable for particularenquiries. Even in the case of textiles, which may seem at first sight to be an exception, a very large proportion of these goods is distributed by &apos;&apos; mixedretailers handling a wide variety of articles. The co-operative societies andthe multiple, department, variety-chain and village stores cut across all thethe barriers between trades, while at the wholesaling end not only are mostwholesalers very mixed traders but the mixture varies enormously. For these reasons an Interdepartmental Committee rejected the possibility of holding a partial census limited to specific trades. It is possible, indeed, that the census of Distribution which will for the first time provide comprehensive informa-tion about the numbers and types of shops and the people employed in them willreveal a need for enquiry not into specific trades but into specific aspects of distribution (for example, the use of labour, variations in gross margins, &amp;c).Such enquiries cannot, however, usefully be carried out until the whole pictureis known: moreover, direct action of the type mentioned in the first threeparagraphs of this paper must wait, as far as the main field of retail distribu-tion and large sections of the wholesale trades are concerned, until the results ofthe Census are available.16. On the basis of the present inadequate information it is not possibleto say what form direct Government intervention could take. There is, however,an enormous gap between the methods of the most up-tordate and enterprisingtraders and the run-of-the-mill small shopkeeper : there is a useful function, there-fore, for Government to perform in the dissemination of information on whichthe trade itself can act and thereby bring the standards of the lowest nearer tothose of the highest.  It is manufacturers -rather.- than Government Departments
who are in the best position to influence distribution as airhole, and they ha?e\every incentive to get their goods distributed as Gheajply as possible (indeed, manyof them are among- llie^^fc^e^r-t^y^t^.Q^.^i&apos; Census). Mfatfiout a Census,which will not only give them-the ekj^experience;pf their own trades but will give them information about other traces with which to compare their own, manu-facturers are too much in the dark to risk inaking-any significant changes inthe pattern of distribution. It may be that the taking of a Census will be foundto be by itself the best policy for distribution in this varied field.17. If the Census were to be postponed there would no doubt be considerable pressure for enquiries into particular trades, but it would be idle to expect anyvery worth-while results from these. Apart from the difficulties mentioned inparagraph 15, it is hardly likely, considering the opposition which the, Censushas aroused in some quarters, that a committee carrying out an enquiry muchmore directly related to efficiency than the Census and backecl by nd.&quot;compulsqjjypowers and no means of checking the validity of evidence cquld produce result^reliable enough to be used as a basis for Government action-. (This argument i&amp;illustrated by the fact that an enquiry recently carried out on a voluntary-basilby the British Committee of the International Chamber of Comftierce into the costs and methods of distributing men&apos;s shirts, has produced very meagre results.)18. The arguments used in the preceding paragraphs are limited to th$relation of the Census to a general policy for the distributive trades. Tfievital need for the permanent provision of statistics for. national income and ex-penditure estimates and for indices of current sales and stocks (referred &apos; tc- ;-inparagraph 9 of the annex to CP. (48) 305) remains. Indeed, the more direct action which the Government takes in any part of the economy which in anyway affects the distributive trades, the greater the need for information at least as detailed as the figures which the Census will provide.19. It should be added, too, that four full Censuses (in 1929, 1933, 1935 and1939) and one partial Census (in 1937) have been carried out in the United States;Censuses have been taken in Canada in 1931 and 1941, in Eire in 1933 and in botlfAustralia and South Africa since the war.20.   To sum up (i) Action is being taken by a number of Departments which may have animportant bearing on the distribution of specialised products. this action will be unaffected by decisions taken about the date of the&apos;Census.(ii) The ordinary run of consumer goods are to a great extent untouched.by these measures and must remain so until the Census figures areavailable to make informed enquiry possible.(iii) If we postpone the Census we may be forced into time-wasting enquiriesfor which insufficient basic information is available to make theirireally useful as guides to policy.(Mixed trading makes &quot; trade by trade &quot; enquiries of very doubt-ful value and enquiries which are not backed by compulsory powers are unlikely to produce satisfactory results.)(iv) Whatever the effect on distribution policy the need for the Censusfigures for other purposes remains a vital one.H.

this document is the property of hib britannic majesty&apos;8 governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.  January 1949SECRET Copy No. 31CP. (49) 2Uh January, 1949CABINETCENSUS OF DISTRIBUTIONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster i have thought further about this question since the Cabinet discussed iton 22nd December last (CM. (48) 82nd Conclusions, Minute 4) and feel even moresure than before that it would be a serious political blunder to hold a Census of distribution in 1950.2. I have studied the proposed form attached to CP. (49) 1 for the smallerretailers, and I have no doubt that completion of this form would present real difficulty to many small shopkeepers, particularly questions 6, 7, 8 and 10. our political opponents will certainly lose no opportunity of magnifying these diffi-culties. Many small shopkeepers especially village shopkeepers are part ofthe floating vote, and their shops are significant social centres of gossip andpolitical discussion.3. The proposed timetable could hardly be more disadvantageous from anelectioneering point of view. Forms would be issued to traders early in January1950, reminder letters in April, while prosecutions for failure to complete forms no doubt with earlier warnings would begin in July. I do not think that thesuggestion that traders should be given a slightly longer period in. which tocomplete returns, ie., until May or June, would much improve things.4. There would, of course, be some political embarrassment in going backnow on Drevious decisions and announcements, including the Census of Distri-bution (1950) Order, 1948 (S.I. 1948 No. 2176), made in September last, andpostponing the Census. But this change in plans would be soon forgotten andanyhow would be much less embarrassing in my view than holding the Censusnext year.5. I fully recognise the desirability of having regular information aboutwholesale and retail distribution. Indeed, I was myself responsible, as Presidentof the Board of Trade, for the various steps taken in appointing the Census of distribution Committee, short of the actual signature of the minute of appoint-ment on 12th June, 1945, soon after the Caretaker Government had taken over.But, having waited so long, I do not think that even two years&apos; further delay in the holding of this first Census would be a very serious matter.6. The holding of a Census of Distribution in 1950 would not, of course,help us to frame a policy on distribution for our General Election programme.But that does not mean that we can have no policy. We shall, I hope, be able toinclude in our programme proposals, particularly in the important field of food distribution, which should be both practical and popular.7. I hope, therefore, that my colleagues will agree to postpone this Censusuntil after the Election.H. D.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,6th January, 1949.36387
