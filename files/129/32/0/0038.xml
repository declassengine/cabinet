THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C ONFIDENTIALCP. (49) 38 * COPY NO. 2 \25TH FEBRUARY. 1914-9CABINETECONOMIC SURVEY FOR 1 949Note by the Chancellor of the exchequer the draft Economic Survey which was circulatedunder cover of rny memorandum C. P. (49) 29 has now beenconsidered by the Economic Planning Board, the official committee on Economic Development and the production committee.A large number of detailed amendments arisingfrom these discussions are being incorporated in the text.      It will not, unfortunately, be possible to circulate a revised print as a basis for our discussion at Cabinet, but it is hoped that some copies will beavailable for reference at our meeting..  Accordingly I am circulating herewith a listof the major modifications which are being made.R. S, C,Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1.25TH FEBRUARY, 1949.ANNEXECONOMIC SURVEY FOR 1949Modifications to Provisional ProofPART I   -The text has been simplified, particularly inparagraphs-3, 5 and 6.PART IIElectricity:    Paragraphs 21 to 27This has been very much shortened.

Textiles:    Paragraphs 32 to 36Paragraphs 35 and 36 have been removed.     The sub-stance of paragraph 36 will be transferred to the discussion on consumption in the section dealing with national income and expenditure.-Agriculture:Table VI has been removed since the figures forfeedingstuffs and fertilisers for the&apos; year 1949-50 may provemisleading.Balance of Payments:Revisions to the statistics in this section are notyet completed, but I shall be able to report on this to mycolleagues.      It might be desirable to express the exporttarget for 19^9 rather differently from the way now drafted in view of the high level of exports in January.     This point is under consideration by the President of the Board of Trade.Paragraph 60 has beqn redrafted so as not to appearto belittle the achievement of overall balance, while retaining the emphasis on the dollar problem.Paragraph 65 has been redrafted to avoid misunder-standings in the United States about &quot;unrequited&quot; exports tothe non-dollar world.The following hew paragraph has been introduced afterparagraph 79 to deal with the Canadian position:-&quot;In any consideration of these long-termpolicies, one point must be emphasised.      Our object isnot to build up a non-dollar world from which dollargoods are to be permanently and increasingly excluded;it is to eliminate our deficit with the dollar world sothat we can ultimately get back to normal trading methods.-The restrictions that have been imposed on dollar imports are painful to our overseas suppliers, and particularly to Canada, whose producers have; in many cases,deliberately adjusted their methods so as to meet our special needs.      But these restrictions are not imposedfrom choice;    they are an inescapable consequence of our.shortage of dollars..   That is why they are beingaccompanied by measures to intensify our export drive to canada and the U. S. A. &quot;The section on Import Diversion (paragraphs 8h to 87)has also been recast with an eye for its possible effect in theUnited States of -America and Canada.Man-power:   Paragraphs 88 to 9hA difficulty has arisen over the presentation ofthe figures for manpower in the coal industry.      The forecastfigures in Table XX contrast with the requirement figure statedin paragraph 93 and suggest rather clearly that we may be unable to attain the manpower requirements for the productionestimate.     At the Production Committee I wa-s invited to con-sider how this difficulty could be overcome.      I suggest thatthe best solution would be to remove the word &quot;forecast&quot; fromTable XX, to include the requirement figure for coal manpower,i.e. 795,000, in the Table, and to leave the distinction

between the status of the different figures to appear fromthe text of paragraph 93, which might now read as follows:-&quot;During 1949 there will be no more large netaccessions of manpower from the Services or from arma-Reinforcements work, and no large scale redistribution of labourbetween industries is required.     But more labour con--tinues to be needed in certain industries and it willalso be important to keep other industries uo to strength.The Government therefore intends to maintain&quot;unchangedits existing labour policy.      In the textile industriessubstantial increases would be extremely valuable.Increases of 10,000 in cotton and 5,000 in wool are shownin Table XX, but an improvement on these figures would bedesirable,      In the coalmining industry the^main objec-tive will be to increase by 1h,000 the number of workers employed at the coal face.     To the extent that it isnecessary to replace men upgraded to work at the face, afurther increase in the total number of wage earners oncolliery books will be needed.     Not all the men upgradedto the coal face will have to be replaced.      The estimatemade by the industry is that the number of replacementsrequired will be some 10,000.      On this basis, the labour requirements would be for about 736,000 men on collierybooks at the end of 19h9.      The corresponding figure for total manpower in the coal industry would be 795,000 andthis is the figure included in Table XX.     The attainment of this total will need intensive efforts to reducewastage,  increased recruitment and the entry in particular of further foreign workers.      In agriculture some increase will be &quot;needed but the most acute need will be for temporary labour at harvest time. &quot;This was very much the way in which the matter was treated inthe Economic Survey for 19^3.      I understand that the Ministerof Labour is putting forward a separate memorandum (0. P. (h9) k-O)giving his views on this awkward point of presentation.The paragraph on Government manpower has beenredrafted to stress the importance of economy in public admin-,istration, both national and local.A footnote is being inserted to the Tables to explainsome of the differences in. classification between the old andthe new statistical series of manpower statistics, and to make clear, for example, where the Post Office is included.National Income and ExpenditureCalculations of the national income and expenditurein 19^9 are not yet complete, but I hope to be able to givemy colleagues some account of them.      Table XXVII and paragraph116 have been removed, together with some phrases elsewhere toavoid any possible budgetary implications.PART IIIIn accordance with the recommendation of theProduction Committee paragraph 119 has been recast in a more general form and references to particular targets have been removed.

But more labour con-tinues to be needed in certain industries and it willalso be important to keep other industries up to strength.The Government therefore intends to maintain unchangedits existing labour policy.      In the textile industriessubstantial increases would be extremely valuable.Increases of 10,000 in cotton and 5,000 in wool are shownin Table XX, but an improvement on these figures would bedesirable.      In the coalmining industry the main objec-tive will be to increase by 14,000 the number of workers employed at the coal. face.     To the extent that it isnecessary to replace men upgraded to work at the face, a: .     further increase in the total number of wage earners oncolliery books will be needed.     Hot all the men upgradedto the coal face will have to be replaced.     The estimatemade by the industry is that the number of replacementsrequired will be some 10,000.

I understand that the Ministerof Labour is putting forward a separate memorandum (0. P. (49) 40&apos;)giving his views on this awkward point of presentation.The paragraph on Government manpower has beenredrafted to stress the importance of economy in public admin-,istration, both national and local.A footnote is being inserted to the Tables to explainsome of the differences in classification between the old andthe new statistical series of manpower statistics, and to make clear, for example, where the Post Office is included.-National Income and ExpenditureCalculations of the national income and expenditurein 1949 are not yet complete, but I hope to be able to givemy colleagues some account of them.      Table XXVII and paragraph116 have been removed, together with some phrases elsewhere to-avoid any possible budgetary implications.PART IIIIn accordance with the recommendation of theProduction Committee paragraph 119 has been recast in a more general form and references to particular targets have been removed.

Productivity;    Paragraphs 120 to 128The definition of productivity in paragraph 122 hasbeen widened to relate it to man-years instead of man-hours,.and to draw attention to the importance of regular atten-dance.     The footnote to paragraph 122 and the earlier -footnote to paragraph 96 have been removed.      Paragraphs126 to 128 have been strengthened in order to emphasise theneed for initiative in introducing improvements in productiontechniques on the part both of managements and of workpeople.The Need for- International Co-operation:    Paragraphs 138to 1h-3Amendments have been introduced into this section to acknowledge Canadian credit, to emphasise the attention weare giving to the problem of Canada, and to make it clearthat economic co-operation through 0. E. E. C. will continuewhen external aid comes to an end.Appendix on Capital Investment in 19h9Various amendments have been introduced to meetdepartmental wishes, and-the whole has been shortened.      Inthe section dealing with housing a distinction will be drawn between expenditure on temporary and permanent housing inorder to show that the fall in expenditure between 1948 and19h9 is accounted for mainly by the termination of thetemporary housing programme.ChartsOwing to the absence of firm figures at a sufficientlyearly stage, it has not been possible to prepare enough chartsto give an .adequate coverage of the principal economic sectors.In consequence, the Production Committee has agreed to dispense with illustrative charts in this year&apos;s published version.R. S. C.Treasury Chambers, 3. W.&apos;1.25TH FEBRUARY,  19h9.
