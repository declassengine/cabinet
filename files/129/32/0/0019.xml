David Morse (Government delegate, UnitedStates of America) and the Mayor of San Francisco welcoming the conference to the United States of America and to San Francisco, Mr.lAlvarado (Govern-ment delegate, Peru) as Chairman of the Government Body, declared theConference open. On the nomination of Sir Guildhaume Myrddin-Evans;Mr. Justin Godart (Government delegate, France) was unanimously electedPresident of the Conference. The Vice-Presidents elected were Mr. NurullahEsat Sumer, Turkey, fqr the Government group, Mr. H. C. Oersted, Denmark,for the Employers&apos; group and Mr. Percy R. Bengough, Canada, for the-Workers&apos; group.THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL6. Many deservedly warm tributes were paid to Mr. Edward Phelan who-had announced his intention to retire at 31st August, 1948, and who thus-was attending his last Session of the Conference as Director-General. Mr.Phelan joined the Office from the Ministry of Labour when the organisation was founded in 1919 and has been a member of the staff ever since. Hebecame Deputy Director in 1938 and Acting Director on Mr. Winant&apos;resignation in 1941. In 1946 the Governing Body appointed him Director-General^ antedating the appointment to the date in 1941 when he assumed the duties of Acting Director. -Throughout his association with the Organi-sation his work has been marked by exceptional qualities of imagination and administration and by complete devotion to the Organisation and its aims and ideals.   He will be a great loss to the Organisation.7. The Conference offered a warm welcome to the Hon. David Morse,.Under Secretary for Labor in the United States Government, Who had beenelected by the Governing Body to succeed Mr. Phelan as Director-General.* The title of the post was changed from Director to Director-General in 1946.
MEMBERSHIP OF THE ORGANISATION8. The Conference was informed that Pakistan, Syria^ Burma, the Philip-pines and El Salvador had joined the Organisation since the previous aiessionin 1947. The Conference was also called upon to consider an applicationfor membership by Ceylon. In the course of the Session the Conferencedecided that Ceylon should be admitted. This brought the number of states members of the Organisation to 59.CREDENTIALS9. ;The Credentials Committee established by the Conference was com-posed of Mr. Paal Berg (Government delegate, Norway) as Chairman, withMr. Ppns (Uruguay) and Mr. Paul Firiet (Belgium) as employers&apos; and workers&apos;members respectively. The Committee had to consider objections concern-ing the appointment of the workers&apos; delegates and workers&apos; advisers of theArgentine Republic, Cuba, France, Greece, India, Mexico, Peru andUruguay. &apos;Objections to the credentials of the French workers&apos; delegate.10. The Credentials Committee had before it four objections concerningthe credentials of the French workers&apos; delegate.   The first was from theFrench General Confederation of Labour (Confederation Generate duTravail), and the other three were from the workers&apos; delegates of Czecho-slovakia, Italy, and Poland respectively.   The objection from the GeneralConfederation of Labour (C.G.T.) alleged that, in appointing the Frenchworkers&apos; delegate, the French government had not respected paragraph 5 ofArticle 3 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, which provides that the workers&apos; delegates shall be appointed by the Government&quot;in agreement with the industrial organisations . . / which are most repre-sentative of . ...... workpeople . . . in their respective countries &quot;.     Theyclaimed that the most representative organisation was the C.G.T. and notthe Confederation Generale des Travailleurs-Force Ouyriere, whose president had been appointed&apos; the French workers&apos; delegate. The C.G.T. furtherclaimed to be senior to the C.G.T.-Force Ouyriere and also alleged that thelatter organisation was not independent of the Government. The objectionsof the workers&apos; delegates of Czechoslovakia, Italy and Poland contained sub-stantially the same arguments. The conclusion of the Credentials Committeewas as follows:&quot;. . , the Credentials Committee, having noted the refusal of the C.G.T.to come to an agreement for the appointment of the French workers&apos;delegate, and considering that the appointment by the French Govern-ment of the delegate whose credentials are contested was made in accord-ance with the terms of the Constitution of the International Labour.Organisation, unanimously rejects, as being without foundation, the objection to this appointment.&quot;Objection to the credentials of the workers&apos; delegate of India and his advisers.11. The Credentials Committee had before it objections to the credentialsof the Indian workers&apos; delegate and his advisers from the All-India TradeUnion Congress, the Indian Federation of Labour and the Italian workers&apos;delegate. The Indian workers&apos; delegate to the present Session of the Con-ference and his advisers are members of a new organisation, the indian national Trade Union Congress, established in May, 1947. The first ofthe objections was contained in a letter of 3rd June, 1948, to the Secretary-63105 A3
General of the International Labour Conference from Mr. Joshi, Secretary-General of the All-India Trade Union Congress. This claimed that theIndian National Trade Union Congress was not the most representativeorganisation of the workers of India; that this position continued to be occupied by the All-India Trade Union Congress which had provided theIndian workers&apos; delegate and his advisers to previous sessions of the Inter-national Labour Conference; that the enquiries made by the Government so asto determine which of the Indian trade union organisations was the mostrepresentative were made in an irregular manner and through the intermediaryof Government agents instead of by a strictly impartial tribunal as had been by the All-India Trade Union Congress; and that the indian national Trade Union Congress was dependent upon the Government andeven upon employers. The objections from the Indian Federation of Labourand the Italian workers&apos; delegate contained substantially the same argu-ments.   The Credentials Committee reported as follows:&quot; The Committee thus considers that it is not in a position to maintainthe objections to the credentials of the Indian workers&apos; delegate and&apos;his advisers since no convincing proof has been presented that the con-tested nominations were made in violation of the provisions of the Con-stitution of the Organisation. It hopes, however, that more completeinformation will allow it during subsequent sessions of the conference to arrive at a clear picture of the real position of the trade union move-ment in India.&quot;The Committee asks the Indian Government to make further efforts to obtain the agreement of the various organisations concerned whennominating the workers&apos; delegate of India and his advisers. But, lack-ing sufficient proof, the Credentials Committee unanimously rejects theobjections to the credentials of the Indian workers&apos; delegate to the 31stSession of the Conference and his advisers.&quot;Objection to the credentials of the Peruvian workers&apos; delegate and adviser.12. This objection was submitted by the Confederation of Peruvian workers on the ground that the appointments had been made without agreement oreven consultation with that body.. To the Credentials Committee it appeared that &quot; the Confederation of Peruvian Workers is still the most representativeorganisation, being the only representative industrial organisation of an inter-occupational character in that country&quot;. The report of the CredentialsCommittee continued:&quot;In these circumstances, the Committee could not conclude that theappointment in question was made in accordance with the provisions ofthe Constitution of the International Labour Organisation.&quot; The Committee would, however, draw the attention of the conference to the fact that its power to refuse to admit a delegate or adviser whom it considers has not been appointed in accordance with the Constitutionof the Organisation is of a discretionary character. In the present case,since the Committee considers it possible that the contested appointment was made as a result of a misunderstanding, and since it takes intoaccount the fact that the delegate and adviser appointed exercise certaintrade union functions in their country, the Committee is of the unanimousopinion that it is not desirable for it to exercise this power.&quot;It wishes, however, to&quot; draw the attention of the Conference and ofthe Governments of States Members to the obligations incumbent onthese Governments to conform to the Constitution of the InternationalLabour Organisation when appointing delegates and advisers to sessions of the Conference.
&quot; The Committee would like to emphasise the fact that its decision inthe present case should not be considered as a precedent in future, andthat it reserves the right to re-examine the validity of the credentialsof the Peruvian workers&apos; delegates and their advisers to subsequentsessions of the Conference if, during any such session, a similar objection is made.&quot;Other Objections.13. The objections to the credentials of other delegates, all of which were rejected by the Credentials Committee, do not call for any special comment.14. In concluding this section of our report, however, we wish to call attention to an important proannouncement of the Credentials Committeefollowing its examination of the case of an employers&apos; delegate of a StateMember who was a Government official. The Committee commented in thefollowing terms:&quot;In finishing its work the Committee wishes to report upon a serious problem.&quot; It discovered that the Employers&apos; delegate of a State Member was aGovernment official. However, it took note of the fact that the mandateof this delegate was subsequently changed and that he continued hisparticipation in the work of the Conference as a Government delegate.&quot;The Committee wishes to draw the attention of Governments states members of the International Labour Organisation to their obligation under the Constitution of the Organisation to appoint the Employers&apos;and Workers&apos; delegates and their advisers in agreement with the indus-trial organisations most representative of the country concerned, subjectto the reservations that such organisations exist.&quot;This being the case, there is no question of such delegates and advisers being appointed from among persons who are purely Govern-ment officials. Such an appointment would in fact be inconsistent withthe principles upon which the Organisation is founded.&quot;REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL(Item I of the Agenda)15. The Director-general&apos;s Report contained a general study of world economic developments, a description of trends in social policy and a state-nient of the activities of the International Labour Organisation since the30th Session. Several plenary sessions were occupied with the discussion on the Report in which eighty-seven speakers participated.16. In his speech on the Director-GeneraFs Report, Mr. Isaacs spoke ofthe action of the British Government on some of the problems to which theDirector-General had drawn attention. He referred to the action taken witha view to the stabilization of income and price levels and to promotingincreased production, and to the measures adopted with a view to utilizingto the full our resources of manpower.   He continued:&quot; It is three years almost to a day since the Charter of the united nations was signed in this city. The statesmen of fifty nations lefthere with high hopes, and they carried these hopes back with themto the peoples of the world. They had created an organisation withtremendous potentialities for good, but they knew that everything nowdepended upon the will of the individual nations to work together withinthe new organisation in the spirit of co-operation, of democracy andof the tolerance which the Charter proclaimed.63105 A4
&quot;The representatives of the International Labour Organisation left san francisco sharing these high hopes to the full. Too often, in the years between the wars, we had seen our efforts to work for social justicemade ineffective through the failure of the nations to work together inthe political and economic fields. In the birth of the new organisation,designed to secure that collaboration between the nations in virtually all fields of human effort, we saw new possibilities of advancementopening out before mankind. In these the International LabourOrganisation would fully share, making a contribution which would bethe more effective because of the new and powerful framework ofinternational organisations within which the international LabourOrganisation was to operate.&quot; It would be idle to deny that the three years which have passed have failed to bring fulfilment of most of our high hopes. The impressivemachinery of the United Nations has been set up, and it has worthyachievements to its credit, but the will to use it in the true spirit of the charter has been lacking on the part of some who are possessed of great power and resources, whether for good or evil.&quot;But we in the United Kingdom, while we confess to pur disappoint-ment, affirm that, in spite of them, we retain our faith in the Charterwhich we signed and our high hopes for the organisation which wehelped to create. It is, I think, especially fitting that I should make thataffirmation in this place and at this time.&quot;We retain our faith in the fundamental freedoms on which the Charteris based, and the International Labour Organisaition itself rests upon these same basic conceptions of freedom, the same ardent faith in thevalue and the rights of the individual. That faith found expression nearlythirty years ago in the Constitution of the International Labour Organisa-tion, which gave full rights not only to Governments, but to the repre-sentative organisations of workers and employers. The InternationalLabour Organisation rests upon the solid democratic belief that Govern-ments are not the repositories of all wisdom, and that States are notthe only human groupings in which sole power and authority shouldreside. I speak as a member of a Government and am fully conscious,therefore, of the claims which the Governments can rightly make, andthe special place which they must hold within this Organisation. ButI grew up in the free trade union movement of my country. I know what that movement has contributed to the development of Britishdemocracy; I know how much this Organisation stands to gain from thegrowth of free institutions within its Member States. The InternationalLabour Organisation as we know it could not exist in a world wheretrade unions-were simply part of the State machine, instrumentsdesigned solely to make sure that the worker in field or factory knowswhat the State demands of him and responds to the demand in theway which the State requires.&quot; The International Labour Organisation rests also on the solid demo-cratic, belief in the ultimate force of informed public opinion. Andby informed I mean freely, widely and liberally informed. Conventionsbecome effective because through democratic processes, where there isfree thought, a free press and free public discussion, the will of those affected by the Convention can ultimately be brought to bear. TheInternational Labour Organisation as we know it could not exist in a world where thought is bounded by one political or economic creed,
where the press exists only to promulgate that creed, and where the will of the majority is completely determined and controlled by theleaders of the one political party which the creed allows.&quot;FINANCIAL AND BUDGETARY QUESTIONS(Item II of the Agenda)17. The financial and budgetary questions before the Conference were referred for consideration to the Finance Committee of government representatives.18. The main business of the Committee was in connexion with the Budget.The Committee recommended to the Conference a Budget of net expenditure for 1949 amounting to $5,185,539 compared with $4,425,930 for 1948. Asthe result of increased contributions from certain Members the number of units of contributions from the States Members of the Organisation will beincreased from 784 in 1948 to 817J in 1949. The United Kingdom contribu-tion remains at 108 units and the United Kingdom share of the expenditureBudget is 13.2 per cent, in 1949 compared with 13.8 per cent, in 1948. Aftercrediting the 1947 surplus the net cash contribution to be made to theOrganisation by the United Kingdom will be $581,630 (about  144,000)compared with $541,718 (about  134,000) in 1948.19. The Conference adopted the Budget as proposed by the Committeewithout a dissentient vote. The United Kingdom Government, employers&apos;and workers&apos; representatives all voted in favour of the Budget.20. In addition, the Committee proposed to the Conference certain arrange-ments relating to the arrears of payments of Hungary, Liberia and Bulgaria;recommended certain amendments to the Staff Pensions Regulations; and supported certain other dispositions relating to the Staff Pensions Fundproposed by the Governing Body. The Conference accepted the Committee&apos;sreport and proposals on the various matters dealt with therein.   .REPORTS ON- THE APPLICATION OF CONVENTIONS(Item ILT of the Agenda)21. The Committee set up by the Conference to deal with this item onits agenda had before it the Report of the Committee of Experts on theApplication of Conventions as well as the Reports on the Application ofConventions submitted by Governments in accordance with Article 22 oftfhe Constitution. In the course of its meetings the Committee heard anumber of statements by Government representatives supplementing informa-tion already furnished or supplying new information. The Committee.also considered certain tables originally presented by Sir John Forbes Watson,showing the position of ratifications and votes cast by Government delegates,as brought up to date and supplemented by the International Labour Office.22. In its report the Committee pointed out that although the number of reports submitted by Governments was relatively higher than last year,the situation was still far from satisfactory. In particular, it listed a numberof States Members which had not submitted any reports for several years.Representatives of those States, who were present at the Conference, ,were invited to explain to the Committee the situation in their various countries and this they did.63105 A5
23. The report of the Committee concluded with these words:&quot;The Committee recommends to the Conference the approval ofthis report, which was adopted unanimously. At the same time itaddresses a renewed appeal to States Members to comply scrupulouslywith their obligations. The value of the International Labour Organisa-tion depends on the use to which its Members put it. While it isimportant for the Conference to adopt Conventions and recommendations which further social progress and are based on healthy economic con-ditions, and, while it is important that there should be the widest possible ratification of Conventions, it is of no less importance that theStates Members should comply conscientiously and in a spirit of democracy and of fruitful collaboration with the explicit obligations ofthe Constitution.&quot; ,24. The Conference adopted the Committee&apos;s report.EMPLOYMENT SERVICE ORGANISATION(Item IV of the Agenda)25. At its 30th Session the International Labour Conference had decidedto place on the agenda of the following General Session:(1) the question of employment service organisation with a view to finaldecision on a Convention and Recommendation on the subject,and(2) the question of the revision of the Fee-Charging Employment Agen-cies Convention, 1933 (No. 34).26. On the first of these subjects the Committee set up by the Conference toexamine them had before it a draft Convention and Recommendation preparedby the International Labour Office and modified in the light of the observa-tions submitted by Governments. The United Kingdom Government^ obser-vations were limited in the main to points of detail, the proposals for aConvention and Recommendation on this subject being acceptable in principle.27. The object of the proposed Convention was to set out the main prin-ciples on which an employment service should be based, having regard to thewidely different administrative systems and stages of industrial developmentof the many countries concerned. In presenting the first report of the Com-mittee to the Conference, Miss Mary Smieton (Government representative,United Kingdom), the Committee&apos;s reporter, said:&quot; I should like to draw the attention of the Conference to the unani-mous view of the Committee as expressed in the report that the employ-ment service as provided for in the Convention Will be of the gratest value in the economic life of those countries which adopt it. The employ-ment service is a voluntary service and depends therefore for its effective-ness on its own efficiency on the one hand, and on the use which is madeof it by employers and workers on the other. It is the more encouraging,therefore, to be able to report that on none of the more important ques-tions of principle included in the Convention was there any substantialdisagreement between the three groups on the Committee.&quot;28. The Convention was adopted by 127 votes to 0. The United KingdomGovernment, employers&apos; and workers&apos; representatives all voted for the Con-vention.
29. The draft Recommendation before the Committee contained detailedguidance on the means for providing an efficient employment service. Itraised certain questions of policy of particular importance relating to thereferral of workers to employment in cases of trade dispute, sub-standardwages and unfair discrimination. So far as the Convention was concerned theCommittee had agreed to a provision that each country would decide its own policy on the referral of workers in such cases, but that representatives ofemployers and workers would be consulted before decisions were taken. TheUnited Kingdom Government delegation would have liked to see a similar line taken on this question in the Recommendation, but the majority of the Com-mittee took the view that the Recommendation should contain more positiveproposals on the matter. Accordingly that section of the draft Recommenda-tion dealing with this point which the Committee submitted to the conference was to the general effect:(1) that the employment service should observe strict neutrality in thematter of the reference of workers to employment in an estab-lishment in which there is a labour dispute affecting such employ-ment, and(2) that the employment service should not refer workers to employmentin respect of which wages or conditions of work fall below thestandard denned by law or regulation, collective agreement orprevailing practice.The United Kingdom Government representative pointed out to the plenary session of the Conference that the second of these requirements would creategreat difficulty for the employment service. Not only would the strict applica-tion of this principle tend to force the employment service into the positionof a wages inspectorate and enforcement service for which it was not qualifiedand which would inevitably militate against its effectiveness as an employment service; in addition it might find itself estopped from bringing to the noticeof unemployed workers, even in times of high unemployment, employment opportunities in respect of which it had reason to think that sub-standard con-ditions of wages or work obtained, a matter which itself might in many caseswell be difficult to determine. He accordingly invited the Conference torecommend in these cases the same requirement as it was proposed to recom-mend in the case of employment affected by trade disputes, namely that theemployment service should observe strict neutrality. Although this proposalobtained considerable support it was not accepted by a majority of the Con-ference. Accordingly the United Kingdom Government delegate felt it neces-sary to inform the Conference that while the United Kingdom Governmentwould vote for the Recommendation as a whole and would give its pro-visions the most sympathetic examination, it must not, in view of the decisionof the Conference on the particular point just referred to, be regarded as.committed without further consideration to accepting every detail of those;provisions. -30. The Recommendation as a whole was subsequently adopted by the Con-ference by 86 votes for to 20 against. The United Kingdom Government and.workers&apos; delegates voted for the Recommendation, the United Kingdomemployers&apos; representative voted against.31. On the question of the revision of the Fee-Charging Employment Agencies Convention, 1933 (No. 34), the Committee had before it a draft preparedby the International Labour Office on the basis of views put forward by governments regarding the direction in which revision seemed desirable.The 1933 Convention provided for the abolition of fee-charging employment:agencies conducted with a view to profit and for the regulation of such agen-cies not conducted with a view to profit.  The United Kingdom Government
had refrained from any comments on the nature of the proposed revisionsince it retained the principle of abolition and accordingly it was not con-sidered that it would enable the United Kingdom Government to ratify theConvention.32. The employers&apos; members of the Committee moved amendments to thedraft text prepared by the Office, the effect of which would be to change the whole basis of the Convention. Whereas the existing Convention con-templated the abolition of fee-charging employment agencies, the employers&apos;group in the Committee proposed that the revised Convention should bedirected to securing adequate Government control over such agencies. the basic amendment proposed by the employers&apos; group, adopted by a narrowmargin when the clause itself was voted, was defeated in the vote on theConvention as a whole. In view of the fundamental nature of the change proposed, it was considered desirable that Governments should be consulted on the principle involved and it was therefore unanimously agreed to recom-mend to the Conference the adoption of a Resolution placing the questionof the revision of the Convention on the agenda of the next Session of theConference. The Conference by 118 votes to 0 agreed with this proposal.The United Kingdom Government, employers&apos; and workers&apos; representative allvoted for the Resolution.VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE (first discussion)(Item V of the Agenda)33. The Governing Body of the International Labour Office at its 101stSession decided to place the question of vocational guidance on the agenda of the 31st Session of the International Labour Conference, under the doublediscussion procedure. The real work of the 31st Session was therefore toconsider how far the matters in question were suitable for international regu-lations at this time and to consider what form such international regulationsmight most appropriately take. It would then be for the next Session ofthe Conference to give definitive form to such international regulations as might be considered desirable.; 34. The Conference decided that this item of the agenda should be re-mitted to the same Committee as considered Item IV of the agenda. TheCommittee had before it a draft list of points considered suitable for inclusion in international regulations. The Committee recommended to the conference that the proposed international regulations should take the form of a Recom-mendation and indicated certain general principles of vocational guidance,technical methods of major significance and appropriate administrative pro-cesses which should be dealt with in the Recommendation. Stress was laid upon the need for sufficient flexibility within the general framework of theRecommendation to meet alternative national approaches to the problem. Inparticular the Committee, while favouring the maximum experimentation withpsychological and psychotechnical methods of vocational guidance, took theview (largely on the initiative of the United Kingdom Government representa-tive) that such methods should not at this stage be regarded as an essentialto successful vocational guidance in all cases and in all conditions.35. The Conference accepted the Committee&apos;s report and adopted, by 117votes for to 0 against, a Resolution placing on the agenda of the next GeneralSession of the Conference the question of vocational guidance with a viewto final decision on a Recommendation on the subject. The United KingdomGovernment, employers&apos; and workers&apos; delegates all voted for the Resolution.
15,WAGES(Item VI of the Agenda)36. The Committee on Wages consisted of 70 members 30 Governmentmembers, 20 employers&apos; members and 20 workers&apos; members. Sir GodfreyInce (United Kingdom Government representative) was elected Chairman.37. The Committee had before it six reports from the International LabourOffice and its discussions covered the following subjects:.(1) Points for inclusion in a Convention and a Recommendation to beadopted next year dealing with labour clauses in public contracts-(first discussion);(2) Points for inclusion in a Convention and a Recommendation to beadopted next year dealing with protection of wages (firstdiscussion);(3) A resolution on equal pay for men and women;(4) A resolution on the application of the principle of a guaranteed week;(5) A general Report on wages.Labour clauses in public contracts38. Principles which the text before the Committee suggested,might be embodied in a Convention differed on a number of important points from thegeneral principles of the Fair Wages Resolution in Great Britain and it wasnecessary for the United Kingdom Government member to propose a numberof amendments. The more important points of difference were that theproposed text required labour clauses to deal not only with terms and con-ditions of employment which are ordinarily the subject of collective agree- .ments in this country, but also with matters such as health, safety and welfare which are ordinarily dealt with by statutory regulation; in addition the proposed text required the Government in certain cases to determine theappropriate terms and conditions of employment to be observed by con-tractors. The United Kingdom Government member proposed a redraft ofthe paragraphs dealing with these and related points and after a lengthydiscussion the Committee adopted a revised text which, in general, followed the main lines of the Fair Wages Resolution in Great Britain while allowingalternative principles to be applied to meet the circumstances of a numberof other countries, The text, as first proposed, also imposed an obligation on Governments to enforce the Fair Wages Clauses by a system of Govern-ment inspection! The United Kingdom Government member proposed amendments to this part of the text on the grounds that Government inspec-tion was inappropriate in this and other countries where effective enforcement:was ensured through the established machinery of organised industry. The:amendments were accepted by the Committee The text was also revised ina manner satisfactory to the United Kingdom as regards the position of LocalAuthority contracts and the penalties to be imposed on contractors. Twoamendments raising important points of principle were proposed by theemployers&apos; group and the workers&apos; group respectively. The employers&apos;&quot;amendment was to extend the scope of the Convention to cover workersdirectly employed by the Government. In the view of the United KingdomGovernment representative it was clearly inappropriate to deal with suchworkers in a Convention relating to contracts and in fact the amendment was rejected by the Committee. The workers&apos; group proposed an amendmentwhich would have had the effect of requiring contractors to observe terms andconditions more favourable than those provided for in collective agreements:.
or than those generally observed in the industry. The United KingdomGovernment member and other Government members opposed this amend-ment on the grounds that it was contrary to the fundamental principles ofthe Fair Wages Clause and would weaken the authority of joint negotiating machinery in the industry. The amendment was defeated. The revised draftadopted by the Committee was accepted by the Conference.39. A number of amendments to the proposed text of the Recommendationwere agreed. During the discussion of the Recommendation the UnitedStates Government Member proposed the inclusion of a new paragraph tothe effect that the terms and conditions of employment which would have tobe observed by virtue of the labour clauses in public contracts should envisagethe possibility of the regular work day being defined as eight hours and theregular work week as 40 hours and overtime rates of pay being not less thanone and a half times the straight time rate. This was strongly opposed by a number of Governments including the United Kingdom GovernmentMember and the amendment was rejected.40. The Resolution placing on the agenda of the next General Sessionof the Conference the question of Labour Clauses in Public Contracts, witha view to final decision on a Convention and Recommendation on thesubject, was adopted by the Conference by 103 votes for to 0 against. TheUnited Kingdom Government and workers&apos; delegates voted for the Resolu-tion; the United Kingdom employers&apos; representative abstained.Protection of wages41. The proposed text of points for inclusion in a Convention dealt inpart with matters covered in Great Britain by the Truck Acts and relatedlegislation and in part with matters dealt with by collective agreements. in discussion on the scope and the application of the proposed Convention, theUnited Kingdom Government member explained the difficulties which thiscaused and proposed a new paragraph which would give Governmentsreasonable freedom in the application of the different provisions of aConvention to various categories of workers and which would make it clearthat the application of certain provisions need not be by law or regulationbut could be through collective agreements or other appropriate arrange-ment. This proposal received the support of a number of Governments andof both employers&apos; and workers&apos; groups and was adopted.42. The proposed text of points for inclusion in a Recommendation werein general unacceptable to the United Kingdom. It contained, for example,considerable detail as to the periodicity of wage payments, and the main-tenance of wage records. The United Kingdom Government memberproposed the deletion of many of the provisions on the grounds that theywere completely inappropriate for international regulation, and the amend-ment of others. . Few of these proposals were, however, agreed by theCommittee and the text of the Recommendation was not substantiallyaltered.43. The Resolution placing on the agenda of the next General Sessionof the Conference the question of the Protection of Wages with a view to final decision on the subject was adopted by 124 votes for to 0 against.The United Kingdom Government, employers&apos; and workers&apos; delegates allvoted for the Resolution.Equal pay44. This was one of the questions raised in the general report on Wagesbefore the Committee.  It had also been dealt with in a Resolution of the
Economic and Social Council of the United Nations which had been trans-mitted to the Director-General of the International Labour Office by theSecretary-General of the United Nations. The Polish Government delegatesubmitted a Resolution on the subject to the Resolutions Committee of theConference which transmitted it to the Wages Committee. The Wiges Com-mittee decided to consider the Polish Resolution in conjunction with the relevant passages of the general report on Wages and the Resolution ofthe Economic and Social Council. When the Polish Resolution had been moved the United States Government member moved an alternative Reso-lution in substitution of the Resolution proposed by the Polish memberwho withdrew his Resolution; A number of amendments were proposed and adopted. The revised text was adopted by the Committee and theConference. The general effect of the Resolution is to recall the variouspronouncements made in favour of the principle of equal remuneration forwork of equal value and, while proposing certain early steps which mightbe taken with a view to the wider application of the principle, to invitethe Governing Body to place the subject for detailed discussion on theagenda of an early Session of the Conference.Guaranteed week45. The United Kingdom Government member proposed a resolution on the guaranteed weekly wage which drew attention to the desirabilityof the progressive extension of the principle where possible, asked theappropriate Industrial Committees to consider possible methods of appli-cation, and invited the Governing Body to consider placing the subject onthe agenda of an early Conference. It.was clear in the discussion on theCommittee that the practice and methods of &quot; a guaranteed wage &quot; variedconsiderably in different countries and that the Resolution, in referring toa guaranteed weekly wage was drafted too narrowly to be generally accept-able. A number of amendments to meet this were accepted by the UnitedKingdom Government member and adopted by the Committee. other amendments which would have involved a substantial change in the termsof the Resolution were rejected and the Resolution, largely in the termsof the original draft, was adopted without opposition by the Committeeand agreed by the Conference.General Report.46. The Committee was unable to complete the discussion on the material in the general report on. Wages owing to the amount of other businessthat was before it. A Resolution placing the general report on the agenda of the next General Session was proposed by the Committee and adoptedby the Conference by 124 votes for to 0 against. The United KingdomGovernment, employers&apos; and workers&apos; delegates all voted for the Resolution.FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND PROTECTION OF THERIGHT TO ORGANISE.(Item VII of the Agenda)Convention on Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right toOrganise47. This subject is, without doubt, one of the most important and most-difficult which has ever been dealt with by the Conference, and the framing of a Convention which the Conference was able to adopt without anydissentient vote represented a striking achievement.
48. Preliminary consideration had been given to the subject at the 30thSession of the Conference which decided to place it on the agenda ofthe 31st Session, with a view to the adoption of one or more Conventions,and also approved a list of the points on which these international regula-tions might be based. The Economic and Social Council and the general assembly of the United Nations had subsequently endorsed the principles-proclaimed by the Conference and had requested the International LabourOrganisation to continue its efforts for securing the adoption of one orseveral international Conventions.49. The importance which the United Kingdom Government; attach tothe subject, and to the adoption of a Convention to deal with it, is clearly-brought out in the following quotation from a speech made io the Con-ference by the Minister of Labour and National Service, when he outlined the United Kingdom Government^ general attitude:&quot;We are specially concerned at this Conference with freedom of association, the aspect of freedom which is of the greatest moment to the International Labour Organisation and one with which, by our traditions and our Constitution, we are pre-eminently suited to-deal. Last year we laid the basis for a notable advance, and it i,sthe profound hope of my Government that when this Conference endswe shall have adopted a Convention embodying the fundamental prin-ciples on which freedom of association must rest. This task has cometo us on the initiative of the United Nations; it forms an essential part of the wider task of establishing fundamental human rights andfreedoms, on which the United Nations is itself engaged.&quot; The work done last year and the International Labour Organisation^approach to the subject have been attacked in some quarters, becausethe resolutions which were adopted have recognised that organisations-of employers have rights, no less than workers&apos; organisations. Thatcriticism strikes a queer note ,to democratic ears. British trade unionists will, I am sure, stand second to none in their insistence on trade union rights. They struggled to secure them for 150 years. Butin democratic countries men do not beheye that their own rights andfreedoms are the better safeguarded by denying them to others. Theydo not think of the rights which are implied in freedom of associationas being the exclusive possession of any one group or type of organisa-tion. They know that the freedom of the individual, and of theorganisation which individuals create, does not grow in that way. Iwould therefore repeat that the approach which the International LabourOrganisation has made is the right approach, the only approach for those who understand social and industrial democracy, and that it willhave the full support of the United Kingdom.&quot;50. The Committee established by the Conference to consider this. item of the agenda consisted of 80 members (40 Government members, 20 em-ploy ers&apos; members and 20 workers&apos; members). It thus included representa-tives of the. great majority of. the. Governments attending the Conference.As a basis for its work the Committee had before it a draft text prepared,by the International Labour Office in the light of replies submitted by governments to a questionnaire based on the list of points approved bythe 30th Session of the Conference. In their&apos;reply to that questionnairethe United Kingdom Government had stated their preference fOr inter-national regulations in the form of a single Convention, provided thatthe regulations did not require the enactment of legislation concerning free-
dom of association or the protection of the right to organise in cases where this freedom and right exist under current law or are satisfactorily secured in other ways.      &apos;51. As was the case in 1947, the Committee was faced with one funda-mental problem on the, satisfactory solution of which all its work depended.This is described in the Comrmttee&apos;s report as the &quot;problem of legality&quot;.On the one hand many members of the Committee considered it essentialthat the Convention should exphcitly embody the obligation of workers&apos;and employers&apos; organisations to respect the law of the land. It was argued that without such a provision organisations would be free to engage inactivities generally recognised to be illegal, and that States would not ratifyany Convention which might have consequences of this kind. On the otherhand it was emphasised that while organisations did not wish to be placedabove the general law, no Convention would be acceptable which mightbe used to support or provide cover for national laws restrictive of thoserights and freedoms which it was the precise object of the Conference tosafeguard. A solution was ultimately found by stating these two principlesas parallel obligations in a single Article, i.e., Article 8 of the Convention,which in its final form is as follows:&quot;1. In exercising the rights provided for in this Convention workers and employers and their respective organisations,&quot; like other persons or organised collectivities, shall respect the law of the land.&apos;&quot;2. The law of the land shall not be such as to impair, nor shall itbe so applied as to. impair, the guarantees, provided for in thisConvention.&quot;52. At the suggestion of the United Kingdom Government representative,the Committee made it clear in its report that the words &quot; nor shall it beso applied as to impair&quot; could not be interpreted as involving any inter-fererice with the independence and authority of the judiciary.53. Of the other matters dealt with in the Committee particular importance was attached by many. Government representatives including those of theUnited Kingdom to the heed for avoiding the obvious difficulties whichwould arise if it were made Mandatory for States to apply the Convention,without reserve or modification, to the armed forces and to the police,but it was recognised that the relevant clause in the Convention should-not be drafted in such a way as to jeopardise any existing rights regardingtrade union organisation or relationships which were enjoyed in certain countries by members of the armed forces or the police. It was found possible to meet these points in the text of the Convention in a way generally acceptable to the members of the Committee.54. Reference should also be made to one other question touching on thescope of the Convention. The Polish Government representative introducedan amendment designed to exclude employers&apos; organisations from the Con-vention altogether. It is noteworthy that the vast majority of workers&apos;representatives joined with those of Governments and employers in supportof the view previously advanced by Mr. Isaacs in his speech to the Plenary-Session and the proposal was defeated by 101 votes to 6.55. In the discussion of the Committee&apos;s report in the full ConferenceMr. Jouhaux (French workers&apos; delegate) while stressing that the Conven-ition did not go as far as the workers would have wished, said that theywould vote for it as a first step in the application of a freedom indispensable
to the development of humanity, and because it was a first statement ofthe necessity for workers to participate through their organisations in social and economic development. Mr. Cornil (Belgian employers&apos; delegate) com-mented on the unanimous desire to get results and said that the extent ofthe concessions made by all parties revealed a mutual trust which had neverbefore been so clearly shown. The degree of unanimity achieved on this difficult and&apos; contentious subject is indicated by the fact that the Con-vention was finally adopted by the Conference by 127 votes to 0. TheUnited Kingdom Government, employers&apos; and workers&apos; delegates all voted in favour of the Convention.International Machinery for Supervising Freedom of Association56. The Committee also considered in the light of a report by the governing body the question of international machinery for supervising freedom of association.  The report of the Governing Body contained two conclusions:(1) once a Convention (or Conventions) on freedom of association had entered into force the system of supervision provided for by theConstitution of the International Labour Organisation would automatically become applicable;(2) the Governing Body in consultation with the United Nations shouldexplore the question of elaborating further machinery for dealingwith certain cases, e.g., where freedom of association may beaffected by the possibility of the exercise of other rights of a.more general character.57. The workers&apos; members of the Committee submitted to the Committeea proposed Resolution recognising, on the one hand, the value of theprovisions in the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation con-cerning the application of Conventions, and, on the other hand, the needfor consultation with the United Nations in order to ensure the widest possible application of a Convention concerning the exercise of the rightof freedom of association.   %58. The United Kingdom Government member proposed certain amend-ments to this text, the object being to reconcile conflicting points of viewby making more specific the nature of the consultation to take place betweenthe Governing Body and the competent organs of the United Nations. after some discussion, the Committee adopted unanimously the text of the workers&apos;Resolution as amended by the United Kingdom Government member. TheResolution was subsequently adopted by the Conference without discussion.APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES&apos; OF THE RIGHT (TOORGANISE AND TO BARGAIN COLLECTIVELY, collective agreements, CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION, ANDCO-OPERATION BETWEEN PUBLIC AUTHORITIES and employers&apos; AND WORKERS&apos; ORGANISATIONS(First discussion.)(Item VIII of the Agenda.). 59. The 30th Session of the Conference decided to include this item on theAgenda of the 31st Session for first discussion with a view to the adoptionof one or more Conventions at subsequent Sessions. The Committee setup by the Conference to consider Item VII of the Agenda (see paragraph 50above) was also entrusted with the consideration of this item.
60.- The Conference had before it a report on the law and practice in the-various countries and the replies of Governments to a questionnaire circulatedby the International Labour Office. In replying to that questionnaire theUnited Kingdom Government expressed their agreement with the desirability.of drawing up international regulations on these various matters, but preferred to reserve their views on the form and scope of these regulations until afterthe discussions at the 31st Session. &apos;,61. In the time available the Committee was not able to do more thandiscuss the general problems to which this item gave rise, and to adoptcertain conclusions relating to the application of the principles of the rightto organise and bargain collectively. The first of these conclusions embodiedthe view of the United Kingdom Government that the regulations might takethe form either of a Convention or a Recommendation. The remainingpoints covered the guarantee of the workers&apos; right to organise, the protec-tion of workers&apos; organisations, acts of wrongful coercion, union; securityclauses, guarantee of the principle of collective bargaining and supervisorymeasures. The Committee also decided to ask the Conference: (1) to put this question on the agenda of its next Session for a second discussion and(2) to put the questions Which had not been discussed collective agree-ments, conciliation and arbitration, and co-operation between public authori-ties and employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations on the agenda of the next session for a first discussion.62. The Conference adopted the report of. the Committee on this subject and adopted by 117 votes to 0 a Resolution embodying the proposals ofthe Committee for the inclusion of items on the agenda of the next GeneralSession of the Conference. The United Kingdom Government, employers&apos;and workers&apos; representatives all voted in favour of the Resolution.PARTIAL REVISION OF THE NIGHT WORK (WOMEN) CONVEN-; TION, 1919, AND OF THE/ NIGHT WORK (WOMEN):   CONVENTION (REVISED), 1934-CONVENTION No. 41.(Item IX of the Agenda.)63. The decision of the 102nd Session of the Governing Body to place the question of the partial revision of Convention No. 41 on the agenda ofthe 31st Session of the Conference was taken in some measure at theinitiative of the United Kingdom Government. Convention No. 41 requiredthat individual women workers should not be employed in industrial under-takings during the &quot; night&quot; period which was defined in the convention as a period of at least eleven consecutive hours including the interval (knownas the &quot;barred period&quot;) between 10 p.m. and 5.0 a.m. (or, exceptionally,11 p.m. and 6 a.m.). In explanation of their attitude the United KingdomGovernment submitted a written statement to the Governing Body which dealt particularly with the definition of &quot;night&quot; in the Convention and thelength of the &quot; barred period &quot;:&quot;The definition of :.&apos;night&quot;V-it ran-&quot;may have been not inapprb-priate, generally speaking, when it was originally framed; but subsequentdevelopments, including changes in social habits and the more extensiveemployment of women in industry, appear to indicate that the olddefinition is too inelastic. In particular it would seem to interfere undulywith the development of double day-shift systems. ... It is suggestedthat the definition of &apos;night&apos; in the Convention should be reconsidered63105 A 6
. with a view to amending it so that, without reducing the minimum periodof eleven hours for the individual workers (indeed the minimum might even be increased to twelve hours), the &apos; barred period&apos; would bereduced in length or at any rate made more flexible so as not to preventevening work on day-shift systems up to 11.0 p.m. as a normal arrange-ment and perhaps even up to 12.6 midnight in some cases. This maybe felt to be desirable in some countries besides the United Kingdom. . . .,.It is suggested that in considering the definition the main point to bekept in mind is the fundamental object of the Convention, namely toprevent employment through the night or on a night shift and to secure;a minimum interval for the individual,iand that the precise times to-be specified as the beginning and end of the &apos; barred period&apos; withinthe eleven hours are relatively, unimportant,1 and the customs and OtherJcircumstances of the country or area or industry as regards startingtimes in the morning and stopping times in; the evening ought to be,taken into account. Another, consideration which is by no means irrele-vant is the modern tendency to alter-the clock so that^ 11 o&apos;clock ormidnight by the clock may really mean 10.0 p.m.: by the sun.&quot; S      n64. The Committee established,by the: Conference to consider this, item onthe agenda made no recommendations for alteration of the scope of. thejConvention. A proposal by the United States Government member, to;-include transport of all kinds was withdrawn on the understanding that the;attention of the Governing Body would be drawn to the question of the night work; of. women in transport&apos; with a view: to a detailed study.j TheCommittee later recommended to the Conference the adoption of a resolution to this effect.&apos;   &apos;;; v-- &apos;. . -       .;&apos; rK ----- - k&quot;to        - tiy.    --&apos;65. The main discussion in the Committee centred on the definition of;&quot;night&quot; for the purpose of the Convention and the length of the &quot;barredperiod&quot;.  The Committee finally proposed to the Conference for adoptiona text in the following terms: (.   v&quot;For the purpose of this Convention the&quot;term? night&apos;-signifies a! periodof at least eleven consecutive hours, including an interval prescribed by the competent authority of at least seven consecutive hours fallingbetween ten o&apos;clock in the evening and seven b&apos;clbck- in the morning;the competent authority may prescribe ^different, intervals for different areas, industries, ^undertakings or branches; of industries -or undertakings,;but shall consult the employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations; concerned; before prescribing an interval beginning after eleven o&apos;clock in the-evening.&quot; j - ,;, cvfiio-This text reconciled the need for continuing the provisions safeguarding theinterests of the workers concerned and the need for making the operation ofthe Convention more flexible. In this important respect, therefore, the re-vision met the point&apos; raised by the United Kingdom&apos; Government^,. &apos;66. The Conference adopted the report of the.Corhmittee.. The revisionof Convention No. 41 the Convention - concerning night work of women employed in industry (revised), 1948-was adopted by 120 votes,, for to2 against. The United Kingdom Government, employers&apos; and^workers&apos; re-presentatives all voted for the revision.      &apos;  1    ;%
PARTIAL REVISION OF THE NIGHT: WORK OF YOUNG PERSONS(INDUSTRY) CONVENTION, 1919(Item ,X of the agenda)67. This Convention, the framing of which i largely dates back to before1914, was felt to be antiquated in various respects, and to call for review in the light of modern&quot;conditions;&quot; Asi in the case of Convention No. 41, animportant point for cbnsideratiori was the introduction of some, greater flexibility so as not to hamper unduly the employment; of young persons in industries in which shift&apos; systems are worked.a Committee tp. de^^wifr^isV^tem at^vhich the main discussion, as in the case of Item IX, centred on the de-finition of &quot;night&quot; and the length of the &quot;barred period V In the case of young persons under 16 the Committee recommended to the conference the adoption of a rest period of 12, hours and a &quot; barred periodfrom7 pin. to 6 a.ih. On the latter point the Conference adopted an amendmentfixing the period from 10 p.in&apos;.&quot; to 6 a.m. As regards young persons of 16and over, the Committee proposed,a rest period of 12 hours and a provision as to the &quot;barred, period&quot; similar to that proposed for women workers(see paragraph 65 above)!69. There, was also discussion in the Committee regarding exceptions.&apos;It was agreed that young persons of ;J.6, iu^&apos;;&apos;oyi^jii^g^^^pap^M towork through the night &quot;for purposes of apprenticeship or vocational train-ing in specified industries or occupations which&apos;are required&apos; to be carriedon continuously &quot;. In &quot;such cases the competent authority should be requiredto consult with the employers&apos;,&apos; and workers&apos; organisations concerned and young persons so employed would be given a rest period/pf at least 13 hoursbetween two work periods. It was alsb agreed that ,a; specific exceptioncovering night; work , in the baking industry should be regained \&apos; subject toamendments bringing it into line with other changes in the Convention. &apos; :&apos;...70. Subject to the amendment referred to in paragraph 68 above the-Conference approved the Committee&apos;s conclusions and adopted the proposedxevision of Convention; No. 6 Convention concerning the night work ofjoung persons.employed^ in industry (revised); 1948-by* 120 votes to 0.The United Kmgdom Government, employers? and workers&apos; representativesvoted, in faypur of/the Convention.SUBSTITUTION FOR THE PROVISIONS OF THE NIGHT. WORK(WOMEN) CONVENTION (REVISED), 1934, AND OF THE NIGHTWORK OF YOUNG PERSONS (INDUSTRY) CONVENTION, 1919,CONTAINED IN THE SCHEDULE TO THE LABOUR STAND-ARDS (NON-METROPOLITAN TERRITORIES) CONVENTION,1947, OF THE CORRESPONDING PROVISIONS OF THE REVIS-ING CONVENTIONS NOW PROPOSED,(Item XI of the Agenda)i71. Article 1 of the Labour Standards (Non-Metropolitan Territories) Con-vention (No. 83) provides for the communication to the International LabourOffice by ratifying States of a declaration stating, in respect of the territoriesreferred to in Article 35 of the Constitution of the Organisation as amendedih,,l?,46, the extent to which it undertakes that the provisions of the variousConvention, set forth in the Schedule to that Convention are, applied:inrespect, of the said territories. /Further, Article 5 of the same Convention.63105
No. 83 provides that the Conference mavi at any session at which the matter-is included in its agenda, adopt by a two-thirds majority amendments to theSchedule, substituting for the provisions of any Convention set forth in theSchedule the provisions of any Convention revising that Convention whichmay have been adopted by the Conference.&quot;72. Having in the course of the Session revised Conventions No. 6 and.No. 41; both of which are reproduced in the Schedule to Convention No. 83,.the Conference decided by 84 votes to 0 to substitute for them the provisiohs-of the revising Conventions as provided for in Article 5 of Convention No. 83..The United Kingdom Government, employers&apos; and workers&apos; representativesall voted1 in favour of the adoption of the Instrument for the Amendmentof the Schedule.PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES OF THE INTERNATIONALLABOUR ORGANISATION(Item XII of the Agenda)73. At its Second Session (September-November, 1947), the general assembly of the United Nations, by resolution of 21st November, 1947,approved a Convention on the privileges and immunities of the specialised agencies. This Convention was divided into two separate parts: (1) a partof a general nature, defining the standard privileges and immunities apphc-able to all the specialised agencies and based, in general, on the united nations Convention on Privileges arid Immunities; (2) nine draft annexesrelating to each of the existing specialised agencies. The object of the annexes was to adapt the standard clauses to each of the specialised agencies and to define the extent to which they applied..to the specialised agency con-concerned. The two parts of the Convention formed a complete body of pro-visions, but whereas the standard clauses constituted a definitive text, the annexes contained in the second part of the Convention were recommenda-tions addressed to each of the specialised agencies. Under the terms of theConvention it was for these agencies to adopt a final text in accordance withthe procedure provided by their respective Constitutions. In order that theConvention on Privileges and Immunities should apply to the InternationalLabour Organisation, the annex concerning the Organisation had thereforefirst to be adopted by the International Labour Conference with such modi-fications or amendments as that Conference saw fit to introduce into the annex and then transmitted to the United Nations.74. The Conference determined that this matter should be considered inthe first place by the Committee on Standing Orders of the Conference (seeparagraph 81 below). -   .   ,75. During the discussion m the Committee On the standard clauses of theConvention a number of Governments reserved their position on certain points. In particular, the United Kingdom Government representative drew attention to the fact that certain Governments were not satisfied, that special,telecommunications rates should be granted to the specialised agencies; thismatter was under consideration by the International Telecommunications^Union and it might be that, as a result of action taken by that organisation,it would be necessary for this section to be further considered; his Govern-ment must accordingly reserve their position as to the attitude they wouldadopt in the discussions on the International Teleconnnunicatibhs Union..The Committee as a whole, however, while taking note of the various reser-vations, supported the standard clauses. &apos;&quot;&quot;
76. The Committee agreed that it would be desirable to introduce twomodifications of substance into the draft annex drawn up by the general assembly of the United Nations.77. The first modification was to include in the annex a new paragraphproviding that the full diplomatic immunities conferred by Section 21 ofthe standard clauses on the Director-General of the International LabourOffice should also be accorded to any Deputy Director-General of the Inter-national Labour Office and to any Assistant Director-General. During thediscussion of this matter in the Committee the United States and canadian government representatives expressed the view of their Governments thatthese immunities should be restricted to the DirectorrGeneral and the UnitedKingdom Government representative expressed the view of his Governmentthat such immunities should be accorded only to the Director-General andone other official of the Organisation. The Committee decided, by 16 votes to 4. to include in the text of the annex submitted by it to the Conference aprovision according this status to any Deputy Director-General and to anyAssistant Director-General In taking this decision the Committee wasinfluenced by the desirability of maintaining the prestige and dignity of theInternational Labour Organisation and of ensuring that its highest officialsby being granted the immunities which are granted to members of diplomatic missions should enjoy the fullest independence for. the discharge of the dutiesentrusted to them.78. Secondly, the Committee proposed that certain immunities, not pro-vided for in the draft annex, should be granted to experts serving on Com-mittees of, or performing missions for, the International Labour Organisation.79. With these modifications the Committee recommended to the Con-ference the adoption of a Resolution accepting on behalf of the organisation the standard clauses of the Convention on the privileges and immunitiesof the specialised agencies as modified by the annex relating to the Inter-national Labour Organisation and providing for the necessary consequentialaction. The Committee also proposed the adoption by the Conference of aResolution recommending that the States Members of the Organisation should&quot; immediately accord as far as possible to and in connexion with the Inter-national Labour Organisation the benefit of the privileges and immunitiesprovided for in the said general Convention as modified by the annexrelating to the International Labour Organisation &quot;.80. In the course of the discussion of the Committee&apos;s report in the plenary session of the Conference, the United Kingdom Government representativereferred to the reservations which Governments had on certain points. sir john Forbes Watson (employers&apos; delegate, United Kingdom) asked for hisdissent from the report to be recorded:  Speaking on the report he said:&quot; I come now to the question of privileges and immunities of the staff.These include among other things exemptions from military service, theright to cross the frontiers of countries other than,their own without having their luggage disturbed, the privilege of diplomatic envoys (withwhich, I am afraid, I have no acquaintance) and immunity from income: tax. &apos;.        *&quot;The Constitution says that this Organisation and its staff shall have such immunities and privileges as are necessary for the fulfilment ofits purposes and I agree to that; But I do not accept the view that the privileges I have mentioned here are essential or necessary for the fulfilment of our purpose.&quot;The Conference accepted the Committee&apos;s report and the Resolutionsproposed in it.63105 A is
STANDING ORDERS81. Apart from the question of the privileges and immunities of theOrganisation (see paragraphs 73-80 above) the Standing Orders Committeehad to consider four questions:(1) the procedure to be followed in the case of the transfer to anotherinternational organisation of all or part of the responsibilities of the International Labour Organisation under a Recommenda-tion. The Committee recommended to the Conference that theappropriate course would be by way of revision of the originalRecommendation and put forward a draft Article for insertion in the Standing Orders of the Conference, providing for a procedure for the revision of Recommendations.(2) the procedure for the admission of States to membership of theInternational Labour Organisation. The Committee recommendedthat the Conference add a new section to the Standing orders of the Conference governing the procedure of admission. Thissection codified the existing practice of the Organisation.(3) the rules concerning the powers, functions and procedure of regionalconferences. The Committee had before it proposed rules for regional conferences convened by the International LabourOrganisation, drawn up by the Governing Body in accordancewith Article 38 (2) of the Constitution of the Organisation,Having made one slight modification the Committee recommendedthese to the Conference for adoption,(4) the relations between the International Labour Organisation and non-governmental organisations. The Committee recommendedthat the Conference approve the recommendation on this subjectsubmitted to it by the Governing Body which proposed that representatives of non-governmental international organisationswith which consultative relationships have been established shouldbe admitted to the Conference and (with certain exceptions) its committees, and set out the procedure to be followed in regardto the hearing or receiving of statements from such representatives.The Committee also recommended to the Conference amendments to itsStanding Orders designed to give effect to these principles.82. The Conference adopted the Committee&apos;s report.RESOLUTIONS83. The Conference adopted a Resolution inviting the Supreme CommanderAllied Powers in Japan to send an observer delegation to the current Sessionof the Conference and suggesting that the delegation should reflect the tri-partite character of the International Labour Organisation. Replying to this invitation the Supreme Commander regretted that the shortage of timemade impracticable the attendance of a delegation on that occasion, but said that the future opportunity of participating in the work of theOrganisation was warmly anticipated.84. The Conference adopted a number of other Resolutions including oneendorsing the aims of the United Nations Appeal for Children and another,submitted by the United Kingdom workers&apos; delegate, requesting the Govern-ing Body to consider the advisability of placing on the Agenda of an earlySession of the Conference, preferably the 1950 Session, the whole questionof the status and employment of domestic workers.
