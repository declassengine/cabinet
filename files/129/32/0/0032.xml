(THISjOGrjM3MT^ISJimjftOPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential cp. (49) 32 OOPY N0.3J17TH FEBRUARY, 19*4-9CABINET321ARMY AND AIR FORCE COURTS- MARTIALMemorandum by the Minister of defence&quot;t their meeting on 15th December, 1948,(CM.(48) 81st Conclusions, Minute 3), the Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Chancellor (CP. (48) 300) covering the reports of the Committee under the chairmanship ofMr. Justice Lewis, and of an inter-departmental committeeof officials, on Army and Air Force Courts Martial.The Cabinet -(1)    Invited the Secretary of state for War toarrange for the publication of the lewis committee report as a Command paper - thereport was presented to Parliament on24th January (cmd. 7608).(2)    Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty, inconsultation with the Lord Chancellor, to set upa corresponding Committee to enquire into NavalCourts Martial - this Committee (under thechairmanship of Mr. Justice Pilcher) is on thepoint of being set up and will be speciallyrequested to conduct its review with someurgency and, if possible, to report within three months.(3)   Agreed that consideration of. the major issues raised should be deferred for the time being,but that the Secretaries of state for War andAir should implement any minor non-controversialrecommendations which were regarded as desirable and which did not require legislation.   Thisis being done.I have recently considered with the service ministers and with the Lord President the Parliamentaryimplications of the position thus reached.   The difficulty is, as the- Lord Chancellor explained in paragraph 2 of his paper, that Parliament had. been led to expect that, when the lewis Committee report was published, it would be accompaniedby a statement of the Government&apos;s decisions on it.   We shall certainly,  therefore, be subject to considerable pressure,both generally and on particular points, for action on therecommendations.We propose that -(a)    v/e should adopt, as soon as possible, any minornon-controversial recommendations not requiringlegislation (as already agreed by the Cabinet).

We shall take care, in doing so, to ensure thatany action on these lines will not embarrass theAdmiralty (indeed the Admiralty may be ablethemselves to adopt some of the minorrecommendations concerned in advance or thereport of Mr, Justice PiIoher&apos;s Committee).(b) on the major recommendations we think it-necessary, before taking final decisions, to wait for the report of the Committee on Naval courts martial.   We think that an early opportunity shouldbe taken, either by myself or by the Secretaryof State for War or Air, to explain this to theHouse and in doing so to underline the fact thatthe Lewis recommendations are of fundamental importance, that many of them are of a controversialnature and that the Government do not propose totake hasty decisions on them.   I append ;-he draftof a possible statement on these lines.    It v/illno doubt be difficult to convince the House that,having set up the Lewis Committee in 1946 andhaving had its report before us for some ten months,we have only now decided that the position of theNavy must be explored and only now set up aspecial Committee to examine it..  Nevertheless weare convinced that the course we propose is right in principle and that Parliament must bebrought to accept it;(c) the question how best to give effect to oureventual decisions on the major recommendations should be considered later, in the light of thereport of the Admiralty Committee and of theParliamentary situation at the time.   special legislation covering all three Services, willprobably be necessary.In view of the political importance which thismatter may assume I think, after consultation with uheLord President, that the Cabinet would wish to consider these proposals..A.V.A.Ministry of Defence, S.W.I.,17th February, 1949*

appendix draft STATEMENT(Question:   To ask the Minister of Defence what action is being taken on.therecommendations of Army and Air force courts Martial Committee (Cmd. 7608) -MR.  ALEXANDER;As the House knows, certain major recommendationsof Mr. Justice Lewis TsCommittee have already been adopted.Chief of these are those for changes in the status and functions of the Judge Advocate General, who is now appointed on the advice of the Lord Chancellor and is responsible tohim, while continuing to advise the Secretaries of State forWar and Air, and whose former functions of preparing cases and conducting prosecutions at courts-martial are now carriedout by directorates of legal services in the War Office andAir Ministry which are quite distinct from the Judge advocate general&apos;s department.     Changes have also been made in the -procedure for the announcement of findings at courts-martial.In addition certain of the final recommendations designed toreduce delays in trial by courts-martial are in process ofbeing implemented by administrative action.Certain of the new features proposed by the lewis committee already form part of the Naval court-martial system.In regard to others, the Admiralty are taking administrative action on similar lines to the War Office and Air Ministry.In particular the Judge Advocate of the Fleet will in future be appointed by, and will be responsible to, the Lord Chancellorinstead of the First Lord. ,The major recommendations, of the Committee still outstanding include the creation of a courts-martial, appeal court,   the reconstitute ion of courts-martial with civilianJudge Presidents, and unanimity of findings.     The changesrecommended require legislation and they are fundamental andconcern the basic structure of the administration of justice in the Services.    Qn the view of the Government they requirethe most careful consideration, and decisions regarding them should on^no account be^ reached hurriedly, or without examining ;their prbbahle-effect&quot;&quot;&quot;oh members of the Army and Air Force andtheir possible consequences in other directions.      In particular7jalthough&quot;for good reasons the Lewis Committee was concerned only with Army and Air Force courts-martial, the question howfar their recommendations should affect the&apos;Naval system is obviously of the first importance and also, owing to thedifferent circumstances of life and service in the Wavy, amatter of considerable difficulty.     The Government have there-fore set up a Committee under the chairmanship of Mr.  JusticePilcher, of similar composition to the Lewis Committee and of equal authority, to&apos; examine the Naval courts-martial system.We hope that this Committee will be able to report in about three months, and we do not propose to take final decisions onthe more fundamental recommendations of the Lewis Committee oron any consequential legislation until their reactions on theNaval system have been made clear.The short further delay which will thus result before final decisions are reached and announced is solely, I can assure the House,&apos; in the interests of members of the Servicesthemselves.
