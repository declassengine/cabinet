(48) 79th Conclusions, Minute 6).&apos; R. S. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,17th January, 194.ECONOMIC  report . Man-power the total working population, which declined between the end of 1947and July 1948, has been rising in recent months and at the end of november was only 80,000 (0-4 per cent.) less than a year ago. In this total working population there are less in the armed forces than a year ago, and fewer ex-membersof the armed forces who have not yet taken up employment. As a result the totalnumber in civilian employment in Great Britain is over 30,000 (1 - 6 per cent.)more than a year ago, and the figure of 19-2 million is again the highest figuresince this series of statistics began in 1939.2. Compared with a year ago the increase in civil employment has been mainly in the number of men, due to the reduction in the size of the armed forces. The figure for men has fallen slightly since September 1948 owing tothe suspension of releases of National Service men, but this fall has been morethan offset by a rise in the figure for women since August 1948.3. During November there was a further increase of 22,000 workers inthe manufacturing industries and the total employed at the end of november was 7-36 million almost 1-7 per cent, more than at the end of 1947. during november there were increases of 7,000 in metals and engineering, and 3,000in textiles. &apos;Under-manned industries4.   The number of wage earners on the colliery books, which had fallenfrom 725,900 in August to 723,700 in November, increased steadily each week to 726,300 in the last week of the year the highest total for any week in 1948,36424 b
2The wool industry and both sections of the cotton industry gained more workersin October and November; the 6 per cent, increase in employment in textiles in1948 is the highest percentage increase for any industry group.Unemployment5.   The number of unemployed persons, which had risen from 282,200 at12th July to 327,000 at 15th&quot; November, declined slightly to 327,000 at6th December.  The rise was largely seasonal.II. Production6. The index of total industrial production (1946 = 100) is estimatedprovisionally at 127 for October compared with 124 for September. This was points above the level in October 1947. Preliminary estimates based on a smaller number of series than are used in the compilation of the index suggest that thetotal industrial production rose further in November. Compared with thecorresponding months of last year, the figures for September and October showabout the same improvement as that recorded in May and June before the holidayperiod.7. In October, however, the index for manufacturing industries did not show any increase compared with September. For the six months May to october the level of production in manufacturing industries was about 7 per cent, greater in 1948 than in 1947. Over the same period employment in manufacturing industries rose by about 2 per cent. The evidence available suggests that thelevel of production continues to rise, although some falling-off in the rate of increase during 1949 is probable since employment is unlikely to increase much further.Interim Index of Industrial Production(1946 = 100)	1947	All Industries 1948	Increase	Manufacturing Industries 1947            1948        Increase		May       ......	109	117	4- 8	111	119	4- 8June	114	124		.

Total output of deep-mined and open-cast coal in 1948 was 208-4 million tons. This was 11 - 7 million tons more than in 1947 but 2 - 6 million tons short of the target of 211 million tons. Production of open-cast coal exceeded the target, but output of deep-mined coal was 1-6 per cent, below the target of200 million tons.9. Although the total output of deep-mined coal in 1948 was h\ per cent,greater than in 1947, output since the beginning of November has, on the average,been less than 3 per cent, above output in the corresponding period from November1947 when the extra hours&apos; agreement came into force.10. - Average output per man-shift at the coal face rose from 2-86 tons inthe year 1947 to 2-92 tons in 1948. Absence from work of coal-face workers fell to 10-58 per cent, in the week ended 18th December, but it is too early to say whether the improvement during the last few months will be maintained after the holiday period.

Total overseas shipments and bunkers for 1948 exceeded the target of16 million tons by 300,000 tons. This was made possible mainly owing to thefact that inland consumption was 2^ million tons less than had been allowed for in setting the 1948 production target. Distributed stocks at the end of 1948were 1-6 million tons less than at the end of 1947 though undistributed stocks were 1-2 million tons greater. Most of this increase, however, was in stocks ofopencast coal.Iron and steel12. The output of steel ingots and castings in December was16 per cent, greater than in December 1947. Total output for theyear amounted to 14,877,000 tons, which was 16-9 per cent, greaterthan in 1947 and exceeded the target of 14,500,000 tons for 1948 by 377,000 tons.This increase in steel production was made possible mainly owing to the improve-ment in the supply of home bought Steel scrap which amounted to 4-55 million tons compared with the 3 - 70 million tons forecast in the Economic Survey. this surplus was sufficient to make good the deficit in the forecast receipts of importedscrap and to allow total stocks of scrap to be raised from 336,000 tons at theend of May to 483,000 tons at the end of the year.13. There was a substantial increase in stocks of steel in the country during1948. Stocks at producers&apos; works and British Iron and Steel Corporation stock-yards rose from 749,000 tons at the end of February to 1,003,000 tons at the endof October. Stocks at consumers&apos; works and yards are estimated to have increased from 2-45 to 2-67 million tons during the first six months of 1948.Textiles14. All the main branches of the textile industry recorded increased output in November. Production of cotton yarn rose to a new post-war record of 18 - 53million lbs. in the third week of December, and the weekly average for themonth amounted to 18-02 million lbs. Total production for the year (fifty-two weeks ended 25th December) was 890 - 4 million lbs., compared with the economic survey target of 900 million lbs. for the year. Output of woven cotton and rayonfabrics increased to a new record of 51 - 4 million linear yards a week in november and production of rayon yarn and staple fibre rose to 21-0 million lbs. Table 4,however, shows that total production for the year will fall short of the targetsgiven in the Economic Survey.Motor Vehicles15. The output of passenger cars, which declined from &apos;6,926 a week inSeptember to 6,539 a week in October, fell further to 6,432 a week in November.The number of cars produced for export fell from 5,046 a week in september to 4,371 a week in November, while the number produced for the home marketrose from 1,880 to 2,060 a week. The number of large cars (over 2,200 c.c.) pro-duced rose further from an average of 500 a week in the third quarter of the36424 b 2
year to 843 a week in November. Of these the number produced for export rose from 268 to 507 a week.16. Production of commercial vehicles declined from the record level of3,904, a week in October to 3,816 a week in November. The number produced forexport was lower in November but production for the home-market increased again to 2,059 a week more than in any month since November 1947. t:- III.-Building17. There was a small reduction in the number of new houses (excludingaluminium houses) completed in November but the number of new houses startedrose further from 15,099 in October to 15,710 in November. The number of houses under construction therefore fell less rapidly from 194,424 to 192,343 during themonth. .18; New contracts were granted during November for 19,077 houses andthe number on contract but not started rose further to 60,934 at the end of themonth. -IV.-External Trade19. The value of British exports rose again in November to  147-1 million or  1-5 million greater than the record figures of July 1948. The volume of exports in November is estimated to be 48 per cent, higher than in 1938.20. The value of exports in December is provisionally estimated at 145 - 7 million slightly less than in November, but December contained one lessworking day. .21. Exports of metal goods in November rose to  70 million-the sameas in July and exports of textiles increased to a new post-war record of 31 - 6 million. Table 12 shows that value of exports of cotton goods in Novemberexceeded the target rate for the end of the year, although exports of othertextiles and clothing were still well below the targets set.22. The value of imports also rose in November and the adverse visiblebalance of trade was almost the same  28-8 million as in October. This* compares with an adverse balance of  34 -1 million a month in the third quarterand of  41 - 8 million a month in the first half of 1948. On the basis of pro-visional figures for December the adverse balance appears to have declined further in that month to  26 - 5 million.Visible Balance of TradeQ)(Monthly average in   million)		Total all countries	Western Hemisphere	Other non-sterling countries	Sterling area British colonies     Other	1947	Year         ......	-49-3	-51-7	-1-2-0	-3-0	4-3-51948	1st half	-41-8	-37-3	-4-7	-4-1	-1-4-2	3rd quarter......	-34-1	-38-0	-1-7	-1-4	4-7-1	October	-29-0	-31-9	-2-7-	+0-6	+5-0	November  ......	-28-8	-29-6	-8-0	4-4-5	4-4-3	December   ......	-26-5(2)				(&apos;) imponv (&quot;ifl) teg Exports and re-exports (f.o.b.).\ea* w*ftft$ (e-Vfc,(2) Provisional estimates.23. The balance of trade with the Western Hemisphere countries is lessunfavourable than it was earlier in 1948 and in 1947. In November there wasa marked increase in the adverse balance with other non-sterling countries. .
Y.; Balance of Payments24. The sterling area gold and dollar deficit for the fourth quarter 1948was  93 million. E.R.P. reimbursements to the United Kingdom (for various parts of 1948) amounted to  107 million, and there were drawings on the Inter-national Monetary Fund during the quarter of  6 million hy India. TheExchange Equalisation Account gold and dollar holdings therefore increased, by 20 million, to  457 million at the end of 1948.25. The quarterly record for the year, in a form designed to bring out thechange in gold and dollar holdings, is shown in the following table :- Changes in Gold and Dollar Holdings  million		1948			Year	1st Qtr.	2nd Qtr.	3rd Qtr.	4th Qtr.

Holdings at end of quarter  (gold, US.  and Canadian dollarsX1)	552	473	437	457	C1)  512 million at 31st December, 1947.26. In addition to the actual holdings of gold and dollars by the exchange equalisation Account, the further reimbursement due to us under E.R.P. inrespect of expenditure to the end of 1948 amounts to about  90 million. The totalgold and dollar reserves (excluding the remainder of the Canadian Line of Credit)therefore effectively amounts to nearly  550 million. This compares with.a figureof  552 million at the date when E.R.P. began 1st April, 1948. It is this figurethat we aim at preserving during the E.R.P. period.27. The December gold and dollar deficit was  25 million compared with 22 million in October and  46 million in November. The improvement from thelarge November deficit was due to a sharp reduction in the Indian drawings onthe central reserves and a reduction in the rate of expenditure in Canada on food, which, after averaging f27 million a month in the third quarter, rose to$44 million in October to $539 million in November, and was f 30 million in December. An unfavourable item during the fourth quarter has been theincrease in dollar expenditure by Persia, which was running at a monthly averageof $2 million in the first half of this year and has risen during the second half-year, reaching a rate of $9 million a month in the fourth quarter. There are signs that a rather high rate of expenditure may be maintained by Persia, but our ability to control this expenditure is weakened by our vulnerable position in thatcountry.28. E.R.P. reimbursements have been coming in rapidly. They were 59 million in December ( 17 million in October,  31 million in November).29. During the first half of 1949 little improvement in the gold and dollar deficit can be expected in comparison with the rather high fourth quarter result.The main factors leading to an improvement in the middle of this year may have
been halted or reversed; the dollar surplus of the Colonies may be lower becauseof lower cocoa prices and possible lower production; and Indian expenditure willcontinue to be high, though largely covered by her drawings on the international monetary Fund (which may amount to  19 million in the coming six months). the trend of exports to the United States does not seem to be sharply upwards, andthere has been a fall in the price of oil which will tend to reduce our earningsbelow previous expectations; the net result of all these considerations is that,taking into account the amount of E.R.P. due to us and to Eire up to the end ofthe first Marshall year (July 1948 to June 1949), we shall just about have our gold and dollar deficit covered. The future, after June 1949 (when E.R.P. will be ata much lower rate), is difficult to foresee, but it is clear that one particularly important consideration will be the way in which our gold and dollar deficits withthird countries (Belgium, Persia, &amp;c.) are covered in the second Marshall year.Gold and Dollar Payments to Non-Dollar Countries, 1948$ million	1st Qtr.		2nd Qtr.	3rd Qtr.

Prices30. There was a further adverse movement in November in the terms oftrade. The index of import prices (1938 = 100), which rose from 289 in september to 293 in October, increased further to 296 in November. This rise was due to higher prices of raw materials and of tomatoes and Australian butter.31. The price index of United Kingdom exports (1938 = 100) showed nochange between October and November at 258.Retail prices32. The interim index of retail prices (June 1947 - 100) rose from 108 inOctober to 109 in November. The index of retail food prices rose by half a pointfrom 107-6 to 108-1, but this was still lower than in the first quarter of the year.The index of clothing prices has risen steadily every month since the middle of1947 and at 16th November was 15 per cent, higher than in June 1947. There wasno significant change in November in the indices for other groups.Wholesale Prices33. The Board of Trade index of wholesale prices has shown very little change since April 1948. The index for manufactured articles has remainedalmost constant since June 1948 but the indices for basic materials and semi-manufactured products have continued to rise. Wool prices were higher inNovember and December and prices of both raw cotton and non-ferrous metalsrose in December.
Prices in the United States34. The general index of wholesale prices (1938 = 100) declined further inNovember to 209 and was only 3 per cent, above the index for November 1947.The index of wholesale prices of farm products has declined from 284 in June to258 in November, compared with 274 in November 1947. Moody&apos;s index of staplecommodity prices showed very little change in December.VII.-Wage Rates35. There was no significant change in November in the Ministry of Labour&apos;sindices of wage rates. The total index for all industries was 107, compared with100 in June 1947.36. Increases in wage rates which became effective in November as theresult of agreements reached during the month or earlier added approximately 115,000 to the weekly wages of about 492,000 workers.37. The most important claim presented in November was that by theNational Union of Mineworkers for linking wage rates to movements in the index of retail prices. The Union also presented a claim for holidays with pay for twoconsecutive weeks which has been rejected by the National Coal Board. Thebuilding trade unions have submitted claims for an increase of 11*. a week forlabourers and for payment of certain semi-skilled workers at craftsmen&apos;s rates.The employers have proposed reductions in the rates of pay for apprentices.38. A dispute now exists over the claim by the National Union of Railway-men and the question whether the existing joint conciliation machinery of theRailway Executive and the London Transport Executive is adequate to deal withthe dispute has been considered by a panel of five members of the National Arbitra-tioh Tribunal. The Agricultural Wages Board was due to meet on 15th january to consider further the claim for wage increases, a reduction in hours and anincrease in annual holidays.YIII. Bilateral Negotiations39. Agreement has been reached with the United States Government forthe prolongation for three months from the end of 1948 of the Fusion agreement for the Combined Zones of Germany. Negotiations between the United Kingdomand the Bizonal authorities on trade and payments are expected to follow in thenear future.40. The outstanding questions in the Yugoslav negotiations have been resolved and the trade agreement was signed on 23rd December. The questionof a longer term trade agreement may lead to further negotiations between thetwo Governments;41. The trade and financial negotiations with Poland, which have covered the last four months, have now been concluded and a five-year agreement was signed on 14th January. Under it we shall obtain increasing quantities of bacon,eggs and other food-stuffs and substantial supplies of timber, and Poland will obtain various raw materials and manufactured goods including capital equip-ment. We have also secured agreement to a procedure for the settlement of Polishdebts and compensation.42. Trade and payments agreements for 1949 with Sweden and Norwaywere concluded on 16th and 17th December respectively.43. As a result of negotiations with Spain which were concluded on15th December our Monetary Agreement with that country has been replaced by a Sterling Payments Agreement. During these negotiations the course of anglo-Spanish trade was also reviewed.44. Trade and payments negotiations with Switzerland, covering the yearbeginning 1st March, 1949, have been taking place in Berne, but have been suspended temporarily, largely on account of differences of view on the questionof tourism.  They will be resumed this week in London.
45. Trade and payments negotiations are now in progress with Russia,Egypt, Brazil, Belgium, Finland and Turkey, and negotiations with France,Italy and the Netherlands are expected to begin before the end of January.Negotiations with Ceylon and Burma on their hard-currency requirements arealso expected to begin this month. ,46.: It has not yet been possible to fix a date for the opening of negotiationswith Argentina for an agreement to succeed the Andes Agreement. It now seems unlikely that Senor Miranda will come to London in the near future,and the talks may have to begin in Buenos Aires, I am at the moment con-si dering, with my colleagues, a report by the Overseas Negotiations Committeeon the policy to be pursued. .IX. European Recovery Programme47. Quarterly Programme.-A.- programme for the expenditure of E.R.P.funds in the first quarter of 1949 is being prepared in consultation with the british supply Office in Washington. This has been hampered by difficulty in obtainingagreement on the eligibilty of certain items of expenditure for E.R.P. finance butit appears probable that decisions will shortly be reached.48. Examination of the 1949-50 Programmes. The Report on the 1949-50Programme, covering the national programmes of the participating countries, was approved by the Council of O.E.E.C. just after Christmas and transmitted toE.C.A. The total of the individual bids for aid in 1949-50 was $4,654 million.The O.E.E.C. reduced this figure to $4,347 million. No part of the reduction was applied to any particular country&apos;s bid for aid, since this was technicallynot possible. The Report from O.E.E.C. contained a critical analysis of each country&apos;s programme. In quite a number of instances these comments expressedconsiderable doubts about the correctness of the economic policy which,the country concerned was pursuing. As regards the United Kingdom programme for1949-50, the emphasis was mainly placed upon the anxieties of certain countriesabout a possible sterling shortage in 1949-50 and upon the ambitious character ofthe investment programme, which would call for the continuance of determinedmeasures to avoid inflation.49. Long-term Programme. The O.E.E.C. Interim Report on the Long-term Programme was approved by the Council and handed to E.C.A. at the sametime as the Report on the 1949-50 Programme. This Report summarises nationalprogrammes and analyses the problems which arise from them.50. No solutions are proposed at this stage. The next task, in the capitalsof the participating countries and in Paris, will be to re-examine the nationalprogrammes in the light of the Interim Report and to study possible solutions.We are making a thorough examination of the problems involved in Europeanviability by 1952. We are, at the same time, examining in detail how this affects the United Kingdom and the Sterling Area. We hope that discussions in. Pariswill start not earlier than about the middle of February, when a meeting of theCouncil at the Ministerial level is likely to take place. It is also probable thatthe Committee of Nine Ministers will meet before the Council to consider what changes should be made in the structure of O.E.E.C. to enable it to deal competentlywith the new problems it has to face. This matter will be discussed in a pre-liminary way with M. Spaak and M. Schuman when they are here for the consultative Committee meeting at the end of this month.51. E.R.P. Trades Union Advisory Committee.- The Council of O.E.E.C.at a recent meeting formally recognised the E.R.P. Trades Union AdvisoryCommittee as the official link with O.E.E.C. on all matters affecting Trades Unions.52. E.R.P. legislation. The Economic Co-operation Administration hasembarked on a study of existing E.R.P. legislation in preparation for its work of drafting the new legislation which is to be laid before Congress in 1949. a working Party was set up in London to consider &quot; Troublesome Features ofE.R.P. Legislation &quot;with a view to influencing United States opinion on pointsdirectly concerning the United Kingdom, An informal meeting has been held with Mr. Finletter in London to explain our views and his attitude in general was sympathetic.
APPENDIXRelaxations in Economic ControlsDuring 1848 the machinery of Controls has been under review by Depart-ments. Examiners of Controls have been appointed in the Board of Trade, theMinistry of Supply and the Ministry of Food. The relaxations made fall broadlyinto two classes : (i) Several controls have been relaxed because commodities have become lessscarce (whether because of increased supplies, or because of demandbeing reduced by increased prices, reduced purchasing power or other causes). These relaxations may mean more freedom for the consumeror the resumption of competitive conditions between firms.(ii) In other cases the procedure has been simplified, sometimes by thesubstitution of voluntary co-operation for statutory controls. Suchsimplifications should not greatly alter the degree of control exercised,but they should save some unnecessary irritation to industry andtrade, and result in some increase in efficiency.2. The importance of the relaxations should not be exaggerated. the saving in staff will not be large. The official Co-ordinating Committee on Controls(G.O.C. (48) 31) summarised the effect of the reviews as being &quot;more of a preliminary clearing of the ground than any far-reaching change in the structure of controls operated through the allocations systems.&quot; (Price controls have beenoutside the scope of the reviews of controls, though some small relaxations havebeen made.) Nevertheless a good deal has been done to relax restrictions; toencourage a positive attitude towards relaxations on the part of thoseadministering controls; and in overcoming the reluctance of the various trades,whose private opinions do not always agree with their public professions, to forgo the sheltered conditions induced by some controls.3. The following detailed information on relaxations of controls has beenfurnished by the Ministers concerned : Board of Trade4, Where controlled commodities have become less scarce, controls have beenrelaxed the controls affecting any commodity usually being relaxed by stagesrather than all at once. Though the list of relaxations .made in 1948 is long,the majority of the commodities subject to control at the beginning of the yearstill remain so.5. Consumer Rationing. The following have been taken off the ration:leather apparel, gloves, footwear, children&apos;s rainwear, plastic waterproofs,knitted bathing costumes, ties, curtain cloth and furniture.6. Control of Manufacture has been abolished for some twenty commodities,including mechanical lighters, fountain pens, musical instruments, perambulators,toilet preparations, linoleum, fertilisers, &amp;c.7. Restrictions on the Use of Materials. All restrictions (other than import and export licensing) have been removed on the use of some materials and chemicals, e.a., waste textile materials, glue and gelatine, acetates andparaformaldehyde, &amp;c.8. The Substitution of Private for Public Purchase-Where the. supplyand currency position has permitted, the resumption of private purchase has been allowed, e.g., silk, constructional veneers, oiticica oil, &amp;c.Ministry of Supply9. Revocations of Supply Licensing. Previously no one without a licencecould supply (nor in some cases acquire or manufacture) the following: newtypewriters, various types of office machinery (such as dictating equipment oraddressographs), certain domestic electrical appliances, or wireless receivers.This requirement has now been revoked. Similarly manufacturers of the plant and equipment used in many trades had to have a licence before they could supply them: of the 81 types of machinery previously subject to licensing 75 have now36424 c
been freed. These controls were used to influence the distribution between homeand export. It is hoped to achieve the same result by voluntary co-operation.The relaxations will save time and trouble to the engineering industry. But notmany staff will be saved in the Ministry, because firms must still be given guidance and the provision of statistics must continue.10. The Steel Distribution Scheme. From the beginning of 1949, firms whouse or sub-authorise not more than 25 tons of controlled forms Of steel will (withsome exceptions), be given a single authorisation for their whole allocation. Thiswill be a considerable simplification because these small firms constitute 75 percent, of all firms covered, and because they have a varied production, the steelfor which had often to be sub-authorised from their customers or obtained from several Government Departments. These firms consume less than 5 per cent,of industrial steel, so that the bulk of the engineering industry will remain subjectto steel allocations. Some clearly definable types of steel, however, which are nolonger scarce have been removed from control, e.g., steel castings and tube fittings.Building Controls11. A revised system of building controls has been in operation since november 1948. Industrial building is subject to control from various aspects :the distribution of industry over the country as a whole; . town and country planning in the locality; the limitations of the investment programme; the,useof scarce building materials; the local building situation; and sometimes theprovision of new finance. (There is also the development charge to be settled with the Central Land Board.) The new procedure is designed to make thesecriteria as little as possible like a series of hurdles which the industrialist hasto surmount.   .12. The smaller projects have been freed from licensing because few of them were, in fact, rejected under the old procedure, le., work on industrial, agri-cultural or educational buildings, warehouses and offices with over 10,000 sq. ft.of floor space may now be done without a licence if the cost is not more than 1,000 over a period of a year. (For all other types of property the free limit was raised to  100 from 1st July, 1948.)13. Sponsoring Departments have been given more effective powers to selectprojects for inclusion in the building programme. Each of the principal Sponsor-ing Departments now has an allocation of steel for licensed building, whereas,under the old system, steel was allocated to industrial projects by the inter-departmental Priorities Sub-Committee. Responsibility for selecting projectscosting up to  10,000 has been decentralised to the Regional Controller ofSponsoring Departments.14. Distribution of industry consents will now normally be given by the regional Controllers of the Board of Trade, in consultation, where necessary,with other Departments affected. Previously, these applications were first con-sidered by Regional Panels and could be finally decided only by Panel A, an inter-departmental Committee in London.15. The W.B.A./Materials Priority Scheme, which compelled manufac-turers and distributors to give preference to orders backed by priority certificates,has been abolished, as the materials concerned can now be obtained more easily.16. A pamphlet, written for those wishing to carry out industrial building,will shortly be issued explaining the revised procedure.Ministry of Food17.   The main relaxations in 1948 have been : (i) Consumer rationing was abolished for some commodities; the mostimportant were bread, flour, preserves and certain cereal products.Some of the administrative savings from the ending of bread and flourrationing have been offset by the new arrangements which then hadto be made to control the delivery of flour from mills.(ii) Retail licensing has been abolished for most foods and only a few remain for which a retailer must have a licence before lie can deal in them.While modifications have been made in the past, the pre-war pattern of distribution has remained practically unchanged, but this relaxation-tion is a step towards freedom of trading and unrestricted entry.
(iii) Allocations. It has been possible to get away from the pre-war datumin allocating materials for jam and marmalade and in allocatingcoffee, canned points foods, sugar, poultry and rabbits.18. The other controls affected are very miscellaneous; some minor pricecontrols-have gone and new entrants have been allowed into the import trade insome commodities. But the structure of consumer rationing has not been radicallychanged; the saving in staff has not therefore been large.Ministry of Transport19. Ship Licensing and Freight Rates. Requisition of British ships ceasedin 1946, but until recently British shipowners have had little freedom to use their ships for other than Government cargoes. Now they can employ them inany trade throughout the world after obtaining only a general licence. (Specificvoyage licences are still required for tankers not employed on Governmentapproved programmes, and for dry-cargo ships not registered in the UnitedKingdom, the Channel Islands or Isle of Man when engaged in the UnitedKingdom coasting trade.)20. Since 1946 there has been control of freight rates, but this has beengradually reduced, and from December 1948 has been removed entirely from alltrades other than the United Kingdom coasting trade.
