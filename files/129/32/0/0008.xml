THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1949SECRET Copy No.CP. (49) 812th January, 1949CABINETNORTH-WEST ATLANTIC FISHERIES  CONVENTIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Agriculture and fisheries the Government &quot;of the United States have convened a Conference to openin Washington on 26th January, 1949, to draw up a Convention for the investiga-tion, protection and conservation under international control of the fisheriesresources of the North-West Atlantic. Invitations to participate were sent inthe first place to the Governments of Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy,Newfoundland, Norway, Portugal and Spain, and later, at our request, to theUnited Kingdom. The area proposed to be covered by the Convention includesall the important fishing grounds outside territorial limits in the North-WestAtlantic from the West Coast of Greenland to the New England States ofAmerica. These waters, although at present fished to only a limited extent byBritish fishing vessels, are potentially of great importance to the British fishing industry, and it is important that the United Kingdom should take part in aConference at which machinery for the future control of the fisheries in thearea will be discussed. It is proposed therefore that a British Delegation (drawn from the Fisheries Departments and His Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Washington)should attend the Conference.2. A draft Convention for discussion at the Conference has been circulatedby the United States Government and is reproduced as Appendix A. It proposesthe establishment of an international Commission, to meet at least once a year in North America, consisting of three representatives of each participatingcountry: each country to have three votes which could if necessary be exercised by one representative. The Commission would be empowered to co-ordinate anditself conduct investigations into the fisheries of the area and collect and publishinformation. Provision is made in the draft Convention for the sub-division ofthe whole area into four sub-areas, for each of which a panel with prescribedmembership would be set up. Both the Commission and the panels would beempowered to make regulations dealing with such questions as statistics, fishingoperations for prescribed species of fish, subject in the case of the panels toco-ordination by the Chairman of the Commission. Each participating country would be under obligation to take the necessary steps to implement such regula-tions in the case of its own nationals, and regulations Would not become effectiveuntil such legislative or other action has been taken for the purpose by each country. In order to enforce the regulations, duly authorised enforcement officersof any participating country would be empowered to board and examine anyvessel fishing within the area of the Convention. The draft Convention providesthat countries ratifying it may not withdraw until after the expiry of ten years from the date on which it comes into force. Each participating country wouldbe required to make a contribution towards the expenses of the Commission.3. The Convention contains a provision that the Commission shall enterinto arrangements with the competent authorities of other public international organisations concerning methods of co-operation with them. The activities ofthe proposed Commission do not fit exactly with those of any existing international36423 b
2organisation. In so far as it is a body for promoting and co-ordinating investiga-tions into the productivity of the sea. it would appear to come within the scopeof the Food and Agriculture Organisation. The United States have, however,intentionally initiated these proposals independently of F.A.O., possibly for thereasons stated below, and the British representative at the recent F.A.O-Conference indicated that the United Kingdom did not wish to oppose this method of approach.4. In this connection a complication arises from the invitation to Spainto participate in the Convention. Resolution No. 39 (1) of the General Assemblyof the United Nations recommends that the Franco Government of Spain be debarred from membership of international agencies established by and broughtinto relationship with the United Nations. Spain has, however, already been invited to attend the Conference and in view of her large fishing interests inthe area it would be illogical to exclude her. We propose, therefore, that theUnited Kingdom Delegation should be instructed not to oppose Spanish member-ship of the Commission, although this would probably debar the commission from any formal relations with F.A.O.5. Although the danger of oyerfishing in the North-West Atlantic is not, webelieve as imminent as the Americans have represented, we think it is desirablethat international machinery should be established for the scientific exploitation^and control of the fisheries in that area. A Regional Council, under the auspices of F.A.O., such as the Indo-Pacific Regional Fisheries Council recently consti-tuted, would provide such machinery, but the Americans prefer ad hoc machinery,probably for the reason that membership of a Regional Council under F.A.O.would be open to any member of F.A.O. claiming an interest.6. Having regard to the Truman Declaration of September 1945, withrespect to coastal fisheries in certain areas of the high seas, it is not at presentclear whether the United States Government intend to use the proposed Con-vention as a means of preserving the fisheries in the North-West Atlantic for those countries which have recently conducted fishing operations there. If, how-.ever, that is their intention, it would be at variance with an important principle,which we think should be maintained, that all nations should have the right of free access to the high seas outside territorial waters, subject to any necessaryconservation measures applied equally to all. Subject to the United kingdom delegation receiving satisfactory assurance on this point, we think that themachinery proposed in the draft Convention could, with some modifications, beaccepted as satisfactory for the control of fisheries in the North-West Atlantic.But m any case His Majesty&apos;s Government must insist that they be accorded fullrights of representation on the Commission and its appropriate panels. Thedraft Convention has been examined by the Departments concerned, who haveagreed upon a number of amendments to be put forward at the Conference.7. If the Cabinet endorse our proposals we propose later to examine thepossibility of including in the Sea Fish Bill some provision to enable us to imple-ment regulations made by the Commission, so as to avoid the need for fresh legis-lation on every occasion.Summary8. We accordingly seek authority to take part in the Conference atWashington and to sign a Convention on the general lines of that in Appendix A,provided that the right of all nations to fish on the high seas outside territorial waters is maintained and provided that full representation is accorded to theUnited Kingdom on both the Commission and its appropriate panels.The amendments which we think the United Kingdom Delegation should endeavour to secure are set out in Appendix B.A. W.T.

y57INTERNATIONAL NORTHWEST ATLANTIC FISHERIES CONFER-ENCE TO BE CONVENED AT WASHINGTON, 26TH JANUARY, 1949Background SummaryEarly in the history of the North American Continent the value of the fisheries of the North Atlantic Ocean was recognised. For centuries the nationals of North American and western and southern European countries have fishedportions&quot; of this important area. As a result of the international interest incertain fisheries of the number of treaties dealing with accessory rights onshore and in adjacent waters have been developed and adjusted from time to timeover the years. Until recently, however, consideration was not given to thedesirability of formal international co-operation in the conservation and develop-ment of the fishery resources in question.The increasing recognition of the seriousness of the existing and potentialdepletion of commercially important species of fish in the North Atlantic resultedin an international conference in London in 1937. It was, at that time, consideredfeasible to treat the entire North Atlantic as a single conservation unit. TheInternational Convention for the Regulation of Meshes of Fishing Nets and the size Limits of Fish which was concluded at this conference was accordinglydesigned to apply to the entire North Atlantic.The 1937 Convention did not enter into force and the British Government,therefore, convened other international conferences in London in October 1943and April 1946 to reconsider this general problem. At these International Over-fishing Conferences the United States, after discussions with the other Statescontiguous to the Northwest Atlantic, suggested that there were actually two areas in the North Atlantic which were readily separable because of the nationalsconcerned and the problems involved. It was therefore proposed that considera-tion be given to. the desirability of separate treatment for the Northwest andNorthwest Atlantic. The agreement of the 1946 Conference to this concept isevidenced by the fact that the Convention which resulted from the work of theConference set the western boundary of the Convention area at 42c west longitude.Since it has been agreed that it would be preferable to give separate con-sideration to the Northwest Atlantic, and since it is recognised that there is a genuine need for formal international co-operation in investigation of conservationand development of certain fisheries of this area, the United States Governmenthas prepared convention intended for use as a basis of discussion at aninternational conference to be called by the United States in the near future.The draft convention is designed to provide a means for a continuing co-operativestudy of the fishery resources of the area and a method for the application of suchconservation measures as are found necessary for species of international interest.
APPENDIX BPoints to be put forward by the British delegation in order to anticipate any intention on the part of the Americans to use theConvention as a means of preserving the Northwest Atlantic fisheries for thecountries at present exploiting them, the Delegation should take an early oppor-tunity of making the position of the United Kingdom clear, namely, that all nations have the right of free access to fisheries on the high seas outside territorial waters, and if the signing of the Convention plainly involves the abandonment of this principle the Delegation must refer back for further instructions.The Delegation must also insist on full participation of the United kingdom in the deliberations of the Commission and the Panels. The Delegation willsimilarly refer back for instructions should this be opposed. The Delegation will further endeavour to secure the acceptance of the following points : 1. The Commission to be the sole governing and regulating authority with power to appoint such panels or sub-committees as it may find necessary to carryout investigations and other matters which would facilitate its business.2. The reduction from 10 years to 5 years in the minimum period for whicha Government may be bound by its ratification of the Convention.(It is extremely difficult at this stage to forsee how a Convention of this kindwill be operated in practice. It would be unwise to undertake commitments for as long a period as 10 years)3. The replacement of the enforcement procedure in the American draft bythe procedure adopted in the Final Act of the International Fisheries Conference,London, 22nd October, 1943 (Cmd. 6494).(The American draft provides that the duly authorised enforcement officersof any participating country would be empowered to board and examine anyvessel fishing within the area of the Convention, e.g., Spanish enforcement officerscould board and examine United Kingdom vessels. This will almost inevitably lead to incidents. The procedure of the Final Act of the 1943 Conference pro-vides that vessels shall be boarded and examined only by enforcement officers oftheir own nationality. Other delegations will almost certainly take this pointalso). t4. Insertion of an Article enabling any country other than those who have signed the Convention to adhere to it at a later date and to obtain fullparticipation. .
