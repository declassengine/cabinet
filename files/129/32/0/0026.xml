1 210THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT    /Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1949SECRETCP. (49) 26VSth February, 1949CABINETSEA-BED OIL IN THE PERSIAN GULFMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on 4th November, 1948 (CM. (48) 68th Conclusions, Minute 6), the cabinet agreed at my request to defer for the time being consideration of a memorandum(C.P. (48) 248) which I had circulated on the exploitation of the oil which isbelieved to exist under the sea-bed of the Persian Gulf. I have now considered this matter further and wish to bring it before my colleagues again. The subject is one of considerable difficulty and complexity, but it seems necessary that some decision should be taken with regard to it. The present memorandum supersedesCP. (48) 248.2. It is now technically possible to drill for oil under the sea. There is reason to believe that oil exists in the bed of the Persian Gulf outside the limits of territorial waters. The problem therefore immediately arises how thesepotentially valuable resources should be divided up and developed. I have sought the opinion of the Law Officers on the principles involved in such division, andI attach the text of their opinion-as Annex A: :3. I have been hoping that it might be possible to avoid taking any definiteattitude on this question in view of the disturbed state of the Middle East: andthe conflicting territorial claims in the area, but there are various factors whichwill not allow.of any further delay. The Saudi Arabian Government asked us and the United States Government sOme time ago for advice as to the claim&quot; theyshould make to extend their sovereignty or jurisdiction beyond territorial watersin order that they might give a concession for the oil under the sea. The UnitedStates Government, no doubt largely under pressure f rqm the Arabian-AmericanOil Company, have now decided they can wait no longer and intend very shortly to give certain advice to the Saudi Arabian Government. At least one of theBritish-protected rulers of the States on the western side of the Gulf is underheavy pressure from the oil companies to grant them similar concessions. Theycannot take any step of this kind without our consent. Once Saudi Arabia hastaken action it will hardly be possible for us to advise these States to delay any longer.4.   The States having sovereignty over the shores of the Gulf are-(i) Persia. -(ii) Iraq. ..(iii) Saudi Arabia.(iv) Certain British-protected States, namely: the Arab Sheikhdoms of Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrein and the seven minor Trucial Sheikhdomsof Ajman, Kalba, Dubai, Sharjah, Ras al Khaimah, Umm al Qawain,Abu Dhabi.(v) The State of Muscat and Oman, which, although fully independent, isin great measure under British influence.5.   It is clear what our general objectives should be(a) The British-protected States in (iv) above have entrusted to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment the control of their foreign relations, and this specialpolitical position is of considerable advantage to us: In return wehave a strong obligation to look after the interests of the rulers under36552 BCojiy^ No..31
our protection to the greatest possible exent. It would be difficult forHis Majesty&apos;s Government to advise these rulers not to take actionwhen it appears to be clearly in their interests to do so, specially asregards the grant of concessions for oil development. We must notlet them claim what is not properly theirs, but neither must we letany just claims of theirs go by default or be prejudiced by the acts ofother States.(&amp;) We must so far as possible avoid taking action which will upset inter-national relations in the Persian Gulf and in the Middle Eastgenerally. This means in particular that we must take great care notto offend Iraq or Persia, who have important legitimate interests inthe Persian Gulf. This objective is complicated by the fact thatPersia has a long-standing, but we believe quite unjustifiable, claimto the island of Bahrein, which is one of the Sheikhdoms under ourprotection, and other less important claims to some other small islands in the Gulf. There is a serious danger that, whatever action is taken;whether by Saudi Arabia alone or otherwise, will precipitate furthertrouble with Persia over Bahrein or perhaps even lead the PersianGovernment to make some wild claim to the sea-bed of the persian gulf as a whole or at least to that surrounding Bahrein.(c) While not being unduly influenced by the oil companies, we ought to seethat the British companies get a fair deal and fair opportunity tonegotiate for such concessions as may be legitimately available, i.e., weshould not use our influence to restrain British companies whileAmerican companies are free to negotiate as they wish.(d) We should try so far as possible to keep British and American policyin line.recommendation. I should hope to receive the endorsement of the Cabinet for the general objectives stated above.7. I set out below a summary of several courses which might be adopted in pursuit of these objectives, most of which are open to one or more objections whichI have briefly noted. I do not feel able confidently to recommend the adoptionof one of these courses, but I hope that the Cabinet will consider these alternativesand either come to a decision which should be adopted or give me discretion whichcourse or which combination of courses to follow in pursuit of the general obiec-tives I have mentioned, on the understanding that I would, of course, keep in close touch with the Minister of fuel and Power and that on legal issues I would be guided by the Law Officers.8.   The following are the possible courses of action : ^(1) To call a conference of the riparian States. This is at first sightattractive, since it avoids any suggestion of secret decisions or unfairpressure, such as we might perhaps be accused of if any of those concerned were confronted with a fait accompli. But it seems tohave insuperable obstacles. We hope that in certain circumstances the Persian Government might refrain from taking objectionableaction in this matter in relation to Bahrein and the other Persianclaims, but there is no chance that at a conference of this kind anyPersian Government could do anything but put forward the mostextreme Persian territorial claims to Bahrein and other islands andrefuse to accept any arrangement which did not take account of them,i.e., there is a chance of Persian acquiescence but not of their outrightacceptance. Secondly, there is a long-standing dispute between iraq and Persia on boundaries in the Shafct el Arab which would no,doubtcause great difficulty and delay. Thirdly, at the best such a conference would take a very long time and it is clear that neither the saudi arabian Government nor the Arabian-American Oil Company northe United States Government are prepared to wait. Fourthly,America could not be represented at such a conference, whereas wewould have to be represented, since we are responsible for the foreign relations of the protected States. We should then no doubt be accusedby America of plotting to damage American interests.
. (2) We could seek with American co-operation to ensure the adoption ofthe Continental Shelf &quot; theory adapted to the special needs of thePersian Gulf, i.e., the &quot; Median Line Scheme.&quot; A full description of this plan and some of its difficulties is given in Annex B. In essenceit is as follows. President Truman made a proclamation in 1945extending United States jurisdiction over the continental shelf of theUnited States, i.e., the sea-bed extending round the coasts of the UnitedStates up to the 100-fathom depth. (The text is given in Annex C.)We have made a similar proclamation with regard to the Bahamasand Jamaica and a similar principle was incorporated in a treaty which we made with Venezuela in 1942. The manner in which this principle would be applied to the Persian Gulf, all of which is under100 fathoms in depth, has been worked out in considerable detail byBritish and United States technical experts. The most equitablemethod would be for a &quot; median line &quot; to be drawn down the middleof the Gulf and for lateral lines to be drawn from the shore to thismedian line extending the land boundaries. These lines would divide the sea-bed between the riparian States in accordance with the positionof the land frontiers between them. This division of the sea-bedwould not in any way affect the extent of territorial waters or therights of navigation on the high seas or fishing and pearling rights.The practical result would be that Persia would acquire control ofthe sea-bed in all the north-eastern half of the GulfIraq would get a comparatively small area at the northern end; and the western and south-western &quot;half would be divided between Saudi Arabia andthe British-protected States. The opinion of the Law Officers dealsspecifically with the validity in international law of an arrangement of this kind, and their observations are generally favourable. they say that, while no one can foretell exactly what decision theInternational Court might take, there are good grounds for holdingthat proclamations by the States Concerned putting into effect a schemeof this kind would be legal provided that they were followed by acts of effective occupation, i.e., in this case provided that drilling for oilstarted soon after the proclamations were made. If we were goingto pursue this course we and the Americans would advise the saudi arabian Government to issue a proclamation extending their territory in accordance with this plan. We would advise our protected rulersin the same sense and we and the Americans would tell the iraq and Persian Governments that we had given this advice.- This is undoubtedly the tidiest and most equitable form ofarrangement which can be devised, but to put it into practice by the, means mentioned above would amount to facing Persia and Iraq with more or less of a fait accompli and, therefore, probably cause most undesirable political difficulties.(3) The United States Government have also been seriously impressed bythe political difficulties of going for a full and immediate implement a-tion of the median line proposal. After considerable reflection theyare now thinking of a revised plan under which they would explainin the very near future to the Saudi Arabian Government the general principles of the Truman declaration and the way in which these could be applied in the Persian Gulf. They might then suggest theissue of a proclamation &quot;extending jurisdiction and control oversubmerged areas of the Persian Gulf sea-wards beyond territorial waters within boundaries to be determined as occasion arises onequitable principles by the Saudi Arabian Government in agreementwith States having jurisdiction over adjoining submerged areas.&quot;The next alternative for us to consider is, therefore, that we should join the Americans in giving advice on these lines to the saudi arabian Government; The general idea would be that this saudi arabian proclamation might be regarded as experimental, to test there actions of other States and to see whether the principle waschallenged in international law. The timing of similar advice by usto our protected States would require consideration. We could eithergive advice to the Sheikh of Kuwait in the same sense immediately,since he is the ruler under the most severe pressure, or we could advise36552 B 2
them all in the same sense at once, or we could advise them all tohold their hands for the time being in order to see how the saudi arabian proclamation was received.If all went well the situation would no doubt develop gradually inthe direction of a division of the sea-bed on the basis of the medianline scheme referred to above, but there would be no need to commit ourselves to the whole scheme from the beginning.The State Department do not, so far as we can tell, seem to have considered whether they should tell Persia and Iraq that they are giving this advice to Saudi Arabia or merely let them learn of itwhen the proclamation is issued. There seems no reason why, if weadopted this course, we and the Americans should not tell the iraq and Persian Governments that we were giving this advice. But thiswould certainly mean that we must tell our protected rulers at leastat the same time. We should also have to ensure that the Sheikh ofBahrein was ready to issue a proclamation of his own on the above lines in order to forestall any Persian proclamation relating to thesea-bed round Bahrein in case the Persian Government seemed likelyto make such a claim.To sum up, this alternative is that we should join with the UnitedStates Government in advising the Saudi Arabian Government toextend its jurisdiction over the sea-bed (but not over the sea itself)outside territorial waters but without laying down fixed boundaries,that there would be advantage in informing the Persian and IraqGovernments that we were giving this advice, and that if we did soinform them we must at the same time inform all our protected rulersin order that they might be ready to take early action to stake theirown claims in a similar manner.(4) We could refrain from taking any initiative for as long as possible.This would mean that the Americans would give their advice to theSaudis, who Avould no doubt issue their proclamation at once. this might precipitate action by Iraq and Persia, and it would certainly lead to intensified pressure on us from our protected rulers and fromthe oil companies with a view to concessions being granted in respectof the sea-bed off the protected States. It seems most doubtful if wecould resist this pressure for more than a short time or whether having in mind the interests of the protected rulers we ought to do so. Thereis a serious risk that if we adopt this negative attitude the States for whom we have responsibility may lose patience, particularly when they see Ibn Saud receiving further large sums from the oil companies, andmay decide to go ahead, either openly or secretly, on their own, in orderto obtain further contributions from the oil companies in respect of concessions for the sea-bed. If they did this our whole position in thePersian Gulf would be undermined and we should have lost the chance that we now have of guiding these States in the direction of healthysocial and economic development, with the prospect of full indepen-dence by the time they are ready to stand on their own feet.E. B.Foreign Office, S. W. 1,10th February, 1949.
THE PERSIAN GULFOpinion of the Law Officers of the CrownThe principles of international law applicable to the appropriation of thesubsoil of the sea cannot be said to be settled; and it must be to some extent amatter of conjecture how the International Court would view the proposed appro-priation of the sea-bed and subsoil of the Persian Gulf. The matter must be approached on the basis that the Court would, in applying existing principlesso far as they can be ascertained, adapt them to new circumstances brought about by modern methods of exploitation of the sea-bed and subsoil, with their vastlyincreased range and potentialities. In effect, however, if not in theory, the Courtwill really be called upon to exercise a legislative jurisdiction, and it is quite impossible to say with confidence how they would deal with the matter.Subject to this qualification, we think it can be said to be broadly recognisedthat, whereas the high seas outside territorial waters form an internationalhighway, and, as res communis, cannot be the subject of appropriation, the subsoiland possibly the sea-bed itself are still res mdlius; and, therefore, in accordancewith the ordinary principles applicable to the acquisition of new territory, can beappropriated by effective occupation. Occupation in this sense, however, meansmore than mere notional occupation. In general, a mere declaration of an intent to occupy, not followed by any effective de facto occupation, is not sufficient, to convert new territory into the property of the would-be occupying State. Theapplication of these principles to the given case produces an uncertain result,and the Court would look for guidance to such precedents as can be found. Wethink that the Proclamation of the United States relating to the continental shelf, which has not been the subject of objection by other nations and which,indeed, has been followed by similar Orders in Council by the Crown in relationto the Bahamas and Jamaica, and which moreover itself followed the UnitedKingdom and Venezuela Treaty of 1942 in relation to the submarine areas ofthe Gulf of Paria, constitutes a precedent, not only confirmatory of the rightof a State to acquire the sea bed and subsoil of the seas adjacent to its territorial waters, but also affording some guidance as to the extent to which such acquisitionmay be recognised in international law. At the same time, we are not at presentsatisfied that the precedent would be accepted as establishing that the subsoiland sea-bed can be appropriated by a mere proclamation not followed by anyacts of &quot; effective occupation,&quot; at any rate as a principle of general application.Upon this basis, it seems to us that the following general principles arelikely to be followed in the further development of this branch of internationallaw by the International Court: &apos;1. A riparian State can acquire the subsoil and probably the sea-bed of thehigh seas adjacent to and beyond its own territorial waters.2. In order so to do, it must exercise some measure of effective occupation in the areas which it seeks to acquire.3. Effective occupation in this sense must be conditioned by the type of acts of occupation which in the nature of things can be carried out inrelation to the sea-bed and subsoil.4. The subsoil can, so far as experience has gone (whatever the future maybring) be brought into possession by boring or some similar process,which presumably in general will be carried out from the territory of the riparian State, and could, strictly, only amount to effectiveoccupation in a very limited area.5. International confusion, however, would result unless such boring were carried out within the framework of some announced plan of operations in relation to a specific region which could be co-ordinated with similar activities on the part of neighbouring States. It is thus tobe expected, and it will be a necessary feature of &quot; effective occupa-tion &apos;&apos; for this purpose, that the acquiring State should announceand de-limit some zone of the sea-bed within which it proposes tocarry out these acts of occupation. The zone should be announced in order to avoid incident and dispute with neighbouring States beforethe purported Acts of occupation are carried out.36552 b 3
The above principles, if the scope of exploitation should in the future increasein range so far as to extend over the whole bed of an ocean, will no doubt need tobe adapted to the then existing circumstances. But in present circumstances these principles may, we think, in relation to the case under consideration be summarisedas follows : A riparian State can lawfully announce its intention to acquire and developan area of the subsoil and probably also the sea-bed underlying the waters adjoiningits own territorial waters so long as the claim that it makes is not extravagant inrelation to the area which it has the means, either through its own nationals or inconjunction with other friendly States effectively to possess and develop. If,having announced its intention to acquire such a reasonable stretch of the subsoilof the ocean, it then proceeds by boring or other similar methods to make reasonableuse of the subsoil, it will be recognised in international law as the owner at least of the subsoil in the zone which it has so declared its intention to acquire.On the other hand, we think that the International Court would, withoutfurther authority from precedent in the form of international treaties and accepted practice, hesitate to go beyond this principle in recognising appropria-tion of the subsoil of the ocean by particular States. The question has, forexample, beexi put whether acts of occupation by a Great Power remote from itsown shores and immediately outside the territorial waters of a smaller distantnation, could be recognised as conferring a title upon the Power carrying out theseacts of occupation. In our view, the International Court would not recognise suchoccupation, [at all events until it had been long and effectively persisted in], asconferring a title unless it was accompanied by some long-standing historicalhistorical association between the areas to be acquired and the acquiring State, soas to bring into being something which could be regarded as in the nature of aprescriptive title.We think, however, that, as in the case of the Bahamas and Jamaica, a country can, consonantly with the principle which we above enunciated, acquire the subsoilof seas adjoining the territorial waters of its possessions, as distinct from its ownmetropolitan territory. We do not, furthermore, think that of necessity theremust be something in the nature of a Continental Shelf to enable the subsoil to be acquired. The existence or otherwise of a Continental Shelf and the question!whether the waters are shallow or deep is in our view only relevant in the sense that (as we assume) it is less likely that very deep subsoil could be in fact exploitedor bored in such a manner as to constitute effective occupation in the sense aboveindicated.A further complication arises in relation to the Persian Gulf, in that in substance the acquiring States would be acting, although of their own volition, infact under the guidance and at the instigation of the United Kingdom through theinfluence which the United Kingdom can bring to bear in the conduct of the affairs of those States. We think it likely that the International Court, if it appeared that the Governments of those States were in fact willing and. consenting partiesto the attempted acquisition, would recognise such acquisition as being valid in international law if the other requisites above indicated were fulfilled, although,of course, the resulting property rights would be vested in the acquiring State.This being so, in our view, it would be in international law possible for a goodtitle to be obtained by the littoral States on the shores of the Persian Gulf to thesubsoil of the Gulf by purporting to partition it up to the median line, providedthat, with the assistance of the British and American enterprises willing to operate under licence from those States, the subsoil can be effectively exploited toan extent which reasonably covers the area sought to be appropriated by eachlittoral State.We accordingly think that, upon the assumption that the above-indicatedconditions are fulfilled, and upon tils further assumption that there is no effectivechallenge supported by actual acts of occupation by any other Power, a good title to the subsoil, and probably the sea-bed could be acquired by the littoral States.We are, of course, assuming that the method of exploitation would not materiallyinterfere with ordinary user of the high seas as such. We would emphasise, how-ever, that this expression of opinion in such an uncertain domain of internationallaw must remain to a large extent conjectural; but, in our view, in modern circum-stances, the case could be argued with a sufficient degree of plausibility to justifythe claim being asserted, if the matter ever came before the International Court.
. ANNEX B.The Median Line SchemeThis is the scheme on which the opinion of the Law Officers was specificallysought. When our advice was first asked for, it was the view of the departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government concerned that it would be most objectionable inprinciple and create endless difficulties in practice if, in an area say 15 miles off the coast of State &quot;A,&quot; but nearer to State &quot; A &quot; than to any other State,State &quot;B&quot; were to claim jurisdiction over the subsoil underneath the sea onthe grounds that its nationals were working the minerals there, and that it had acquired the sovereignty and jurisdiction over the part of the sea-bed in question by occupation. Occupation is a method of acquiring territory which is resnullius (i.e., belongs to no State). The bed of the sea is res nullius and, accordingto the prevalent view of international law, capable of being acquired by occupationthough the sea itself cannot be so acquired. Consequently, it had been felt that matters must be so arranged that, in the instance given above, it should beState &quot; A &quot; which should have the jurisdiction and the sovereignty over the occupied sea-bed outside territorial waters but nevertheless off its coasts. Onthis view, the right principle for the solution of the problem would be thatembodied in the proclamation with respect to the natural resources of the subsoiland sea-bed of the continental shelf made by President Truman on 28th September,1945, a copy of which is annexed (Annex &quot; C &quot;) for convenience of reference.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government have already decided to follow the TrumanDeclaration in establishing. British sovereignty over the sea-bed with its natural resources adjacent to the Bahamas and to Jamaica up to the limit of the con-continental shelf which surrounds these islands. The relevant Order-in-council for so doing has now been issued.3. Although President Truman&apos;s proclamation is the most importantdeclaration on this subject, the United Kingdom and Venezuela had previously,by a Treaty signed in February 1942, divided the sea-bed and subsoil of thesubmarine areas of the Gulf of Paria outside territorial waters. By this Treatyeach party agreed not to assert any claim to sovereignty or control over those parts of the submarine areas lying on the other&apos;s side of the boundary, and thesubmarine areas renounced by Venezuela under this Treaty were subsequentlyannexed to His Majesty&apos;s Dominions by an Order-in-Council.4. On the other hand, the application of the principle of President Truman&apos;sproclamation to the Persian Gulf is difficult. In the case of the Eastern coast of the United States, as also in the case of the Bahamas and Jamaica, theapplication of the United States principle is relatively simple. There is acontinental shelf (where the sea-bed is shallow and the depth of the water doesnot exceed 100 fathoms) extending 40 or 50 miles from the shore, followed bya drop in the ocean bed to great depths. The place at which the sea-bed dropsis more or less clearly marked and comes at about the 100 fathom line, and forthe purpose of President Truman&apos;s declaration and for the purposes of our ownannexations in the Bahamas and Jamaica, the 100 fathom limit is being taken as the extent of the continental shelf, and in these cases there is no doubt towhom the bed of the sea belongs by the application of this principle. The persian gulf is, however, a shallow sea which may be regarded as being entirely a-continental shelf. There is no deep water below the 100 fathom line to forma boundary-the lowest depth in the whole Gulf is about 50 fathoms-norindeed is there any marked submarine configuration in the form of a sudden- drop in the level of the sea-bed.  The United States Proclamation itself recognisedWe should, however, add that it seems to us most probable that if the contem-plated action does give rise to any international dispute, attempts might be madeto raise it in the Assembly or even in the Security Council of the United Nations,rather than before the Court. If so raised, it would, of course, be dealt with on purely political grounds.(Signed) HARTLEY SHAWCROSS.FRANK SOSKICE.Law Officers&apos; Department,l%th January, 1949.
that circumstances such as these might exist, but it merely says that in thesecases the boundary should be determined by the States concerned in accordancewith equitable principles. The solution in this case which best carries out these principles would be for the areas claimed by the different States bordering onthe Persian Gulf to be delimited by a line extending lengthwise down the centre of the Gulf equidistant from the eastern and western shores and by transverselines extending the boundaries between the territorial waters of adjacent states to the median line.5. The division of the bed of the Gulf is also complicated by the existenceof islands, in the case of a few of which the title is in dispute, and secondly bythe fact that the boundaries on the land between the various States are notprecisely settled. In one area, indeed, the boundary between Saudi Arabia onthe one hand and the British-protected States of Qatar and Abu Dhabi on theother hand is in dispute between His Majesty&apos;s Government and Saudi Arabia,and the disputed area includes some coastline on both sides of the Qatar peninsula.Thirdly, there is the further complication that the British-protected State ofBahrein, which is most important from the oil point of view, is claimed (albeit,according to the advice of the Law Officers, without any legal justification) to bePersian territory.6. There will be available at the meeting of the Cabinet at which thismemorandum is discussed a map giving a rough indication of the results of dividing up the whole of the sea-bed of the Persian Gulf by a median line drawn between the north-east and south-west shores. The map will also show thetransversal division of the sea-bed on the western side of the median line, andthe place where the median line is terminated at the north-west end and replaced by lines running to the Iraqi-Persian and Iraq-Kuwait frontiers. It must berecognised that no proposals for dividing up the bed of the Persian Gulf, howeverequitable, would be likely to lead to complete agreement between all the Statesinterested. In the first place, Persia might be likely to try to hold up any final agreement since, though getting the lion&apos;s share, she would not be able, under her present legislation, to grant any concession over it, and she would at thesame time experience considerable embarrassment in giving her consent to any action by Bahrein on the lines proposed. In the second place, as stated above,the land boundaries are not in all cases defined or demarcated, and any finaldivision of the waters of the Gulf would depend upon settled land boundaries.Thirdly, the possession of certain islands is in dispute, and lastly, in some areas,there is likely to be scope for disagreement as to what in fact would be an equitabledivision.7. If the median line proposals were taken as a basis for action or discussionwith other Governments it would be made clear that (a) The division of the sea-bed would in no way affect the general characterof the waters outside territorial waters as high seas, or the right of free navigation therein;(b) all existing rights in regard to fishing or pearling or any other establishedright appertaining to any riparian State must be protected and wouldin no way be affected by the division proposed;(c) suitable adjustments of the division of the main sea-bed would have to bemade to take account of islands and their territorial waters apper-taining to a State other than that off whose shores they lie;(d) the median line must cease at a certain point in the north-west (closed)end of the Gulf and there is some question as to precisely where itshould cease and be replaced by lines radiating to the Iraqi and Kuwaitboundaries.8. It will be seen from the Law Officers&apos; Opinion that they consider that theproposals are sound and that action to claim jurisdiction over the sea-bed taken under them would, if followed by acts of effective operation, be likely to besustainable if called in question before an international court.9. The division of the sea-bed on equitable principles by means of individualStates claiming jurisdiction over an area, the boundaries of which shall be fixed in consultation with neighbouring States, appears to,have reasonable legaljustification. There is no doubt that, though for the present the United StatesGovernment will not specifically mention the median line proposals in advising
the Saudi Arabian Government, these or similar equitable principles will, never-theless be the underlying ones governing any division of the sea-bed which mayensue in due course and may at a later stage require to be referred to by the saudi Arabian Government (and such of our protected Governments as we maypermit to act similarly) should their action be called in question by other States.In any case, the present technical limit on the depth of water in which sub-surfaceboring can be carried out is about 16 fathoms. This means that effective occu-pation by boring can only be carried out in comparatively shallow water wellaway from mid-Gulf boundaries which might be the subject of dispute. Thesuggestion has been considered that jurisdiction should be proclaimed only overthe area which can effectively be occupied, that is within the 16-fathom line.The objection to this is that technical advances will no doubt soon make it possible to extract oil at depths greater than 16 fathoms, and if jurisdiction hasbeen claimed only over the area less than 16 fathoms deep, it will then be necessaryto make a further series of proclamations. This would be less convenient than asingle series of proclamations.10. By virtue of His Majesty&apos;s Governments special treaty position withthe Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf, we could ensure that their rulers would apply the principles agreed between us and the Americans for the division of thePersian Gulf waters. The interest of the Government of Iraq is comparativelyunimportant as far as concerns the area which any equitable division of the sea-bedwould allot to them, but they will appreciate that the problem requires an earlysolution and they would naturally attach the greatest importance to their ownshare, small as it must be. The place where the median line is terminated is thus of importance to them. The application of the present principles might conceivably lead to difficulties between the Iraqi and the Persian Governments,but this is a risk which would have to be accepted if this scheme were to beadopted.11. In the worst possible circumstances, Persia might feel impelled to takeus to the United Nations about Bahrein if the issue were brought to a head by thecontinental shelf proclamations. We have discussed this possibility with the americans and have been assured of their close support. If it were impossible toavoid a reference to the United Nations, we should try for a reference by theUnited Nations to the International Court. The Law Officers have recently statedthat the Persian case for Bahrein has no legal validity, but they cannot, of course,guarantee how the International Court may react in any particular set of circum-stances. In any case, we could not avoid the difficulty by refraining from imple-menting the median line or similar proposals. The oil companies have for sometime been busily making enquiries about concessions in the sea-bed off the Arab sideof the Persian Gulf. If they were to ask the Sheikh of Bahrein for a concession,we could hardly advise him to refuse on the ground of the unfounded Persian claim.12. Strong objections to the immediate application of the median line schemehave, however, been raised by the American Ambassador at Tehran, whose views were supported by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Tehran. The ambassador con-sidered that it might affect adversely the present delicate situation in Persia,where an unstable but friendly Government carries on under the hostile eye of theSoviet Union. Persia cannot, owing to the legislation preventing the grant of concessions to foreigners, itself benefit from the proposals, and the ambassadorconsidered the only results for Persia would be to attract Russian pressure in theform of a propaganda campaign based on Persian participation in what might bestyled an Anglo-American &quot; imperialist oil deal.&quot; The ambassador was, there-fore, in favour of delaying action until the situation in Persia improved and feltthat, in view of the important political considerations involved, it was reasonable to resist the heavy pressure of the oil companies, particularly since there was noover-riding world shortage of oil. These views appear to have considerable force;and there is the added consideration at the moment that the Anglo-Iranian oil company have this week resumed in a tense atmosphere discussions with thePersian Government on a number of points which the Persians have raised aboutthe operation of the company&apos;s concession. Course (3) in the main paper aboveseems to go a long way to avoid this difficulty.
