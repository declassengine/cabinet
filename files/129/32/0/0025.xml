Record of conversation between the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs and the Pakistan HighCommissionerWhen the Pakistan High Commissioner called on meyesterday at his request he referred to the Indonesian question,and in particular to the recent Resolution of the security council.      He did not raise any specific points on the Resolu-tion, but told me that the Pakistan Government were worried bythe situation.I told Mr. Rahimtoola that it would in my view be a mistake to concentrate too much on criticising this or that point in the Resolution.      If the Indonesians and their friendsinsisted on the absolute letter of every point in their favour the Dutch might well do the same in regard to points in theResolution which favoured them.      We should then be involved inarguments which might last for weeks or even months, and afterfruitless efforts on the part of the Committee of Good Officesthe whole dispute would only go back to the Security Council.I was seriously concerned myself with creating the necessaryconditions for the Indonesian authorities to take over from theDutch.      The population of Pakistan had the same religion asthe majority of Indonesians, and I hoped that the pakistan government might use their influence with the Indonesians toadopt a more co-operative attitude towards the Dutch, just aswe were advising the Dutch to be more forthcoming in theirattitude towards the Indonesians.      It was surely in the general interest that the efforts of both parties should be directed to the restoration of law and order and to the creation of conditions in which transfer of authority might take placepeacefully, as it had in the Indian sub-continent.      Therewere, after all, vital economic issues at stake, and it wassurely in the interests of the Indonesians themselves to main-tain&apos; a close relationship with Holland, at all events at thepresent stage of their development.      Conditions in Indonesiawere not comparable with those in the Indian sub-continentin so far as the Indonesians had no trained civil servants, armyor other services which had been in existence in Pakistan andin India at the time of the transfer.      I knew that the pakistan Government shared our fear that chaotic conditions inSouth East Asia would only result in a growth of Sovietinfluence there, and it was surely incumbent on all the Govern-ments concerned to do all they could to prevent such chaosarising.      In reply to a question from the High Commissioner-as to whether the Dutch could be relied upon to co-operate onthe lines I had indicated,  I said that I thought that if bothsides approached each other in a rather more co-operative-spirit and the Indonesians showed themselves less suspicious,the Dutch would fulfil all the promises they had undertaken.I informed Mr. Rahimtoola of my earlier conversationwith Mr. Krishna Menon on the same subject, and told him thatI would instruct Mr. Dening to keep in touch with both the high commissioners with a view to exchanging views and seeing whether we could contribute respectively to a satisfactory solution of the Indonesian problem.(Sgd. )    ERNEST BEVIW.5th February, 19k9*

Points raised by the Indian High Corinissionerin his tall: with the Secretary of State on 3rd February, 1949I. Paragraph 2 of the Resolution of the Security Councilon the 28th January, 1949* called upon the Government of theNetherlands -(a) To release immediately and unconditionally all political prisoners arrested by them since the17th December,   1948, in the Republic of Indonesia.(b) To permit officials of the Government of the Republicto return at once to Jogjakarta in order that theymay discharge their responsibilities as under para-graph 1 of the aforesaid Resolution, and further(c) To enable them to exercise their appropriatefunctions in full freedom including administrationof the City of Jogjakarta.The Netherlands authorities were further enjoined interms to afford to the Government of the Republic such facilities as may reasonably be granted by that Government for effective function in Jogjakarta and for communication and consultation with all persons in Indonesia.Hi Paragraph 3 of the Resolution -(a)    noted that the expressed objective and desire of both parties was to establish a Federal independent andsovereign United States of Indonesia(b;    recommended that negotiations be undertaken as soon&quot;as possible by representatives of the Government of.the Netherlands and representatives of the republic of Indonesia with the assistance of the Commission(as set out in paragraph 4 of the Resolution).These negotiations were to be on the basis of the principle setout in the Linggadjati and Renville Agreements and taking advantage of the extent of the Agreement reached between parties on the proposals submitted to them by the United States represen-tative on the Good Offices Commission on the 10th September, 1948.III. It is to be particularly noted that the security council Resolution contemplated the establishment of theFederal Interim Government in Indonesia as a result of negotiations preceded by the fulfilment of the conditions laiddown in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the said Resolution and that thetransfer of sovereignty over Indonesia was to be a further step in the process of negotiations.IV. In accordance with the information received by theGovernment of India, the Government of the Netherlands is notcarrying out and does not appear to intend to cawy out theResolution of the Security Council either in spirit or in terms..The following facts are relevant in this connection:(a) That the prisoners have not been immediately andunconditionally released;(b) that Republican leaders have not been permitted toreturn to Jogjakarta;

(c) that the Republican Government have not been permitted to be reinstated at Jogjakarta;(d) that the Republican authorities and leaders havenot the facilities for effective functioning inmatters of communication or consultation withall Indonesia.The Netherlands Government appear to follow thetactic of relying on Federalist groups to adversely affectthe Republican position and to set up units in the proposedFederation which will function as the creatures of theNetherlands Government.      It is to be noted that the Nether-lands Government are attempting to constitute the territory of Jara, which they occupied during the first police action and has a population of seven and a half million, into a newregional Government with a view to creating Federalist unitsneutralising Republican influence.The Netherlands Government have further ignored thespirit and the special direction in paragraph 3 of the security council&apos;s Resolution -(a) With regard to their and the Republic being theprincipal parties of the negotiations;(b) with regard to invoking the assistance of theCommission;    and(c) in not accepting the principles of previousagreements.V. The Government of India have been informed that sir William Strang and Sir Francis Shepherd who are nowvisiting Singapore have seen the Republican leaders -Professor Supomo, Dr. Dharmasatyawan and Dr. Sjahrir, and atthe same time the Federalists - Drs. Djumana and Wayne.      TheGovernment of India very much hope that British influence andthe good offices of its representatives will be directed tobring about direct negotiations between the Republican leaders and the Dutch Government    in terms of the Resolution and theirtalks with the Federalists would not act in encouragement ofwhat Government of India believe to be Dutch tactics.     TheGovernment of India also hope that no pressure will be put orrepresentation made to the Republic to abandon the rightconceded to them in the Security Council Resolution to returnto Jogjakarta.VI. The Government of India are fully conscious of the concern of His Majesty&apos;s Government and of the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs to bring about a peaceful solution in South East Asia.      The Government of India are making no suggestion that Sir William Strang and Sir Francis Shepherdhave intervened on the side of the Dutch and against theRepublic but have only referred to the impression which theyapprehend might be formed in the minds both of the Dutch andthe Indonesian leaders concerned.

5th February, 1949My dear High Commissioner,Thank you for your letter of 4th Februaryenclosing a note on the points which you raised with mein the course of our talk on 3rd February.I hope to let you have my views on the general position very shortly.     As to your last two paragraphs,I am afraid things are going to be made very difficultindeed if the perfectly normal activities of my officialsare to be liable to misinterpretation of the kind you suggest.As you are well aware, Sir William Strang&apos;s journey is forthe purpose of acquainting himself with the general situationin the East and in this connection with my full approval heis naturally making as many contacts as possible in eachplace which he visits.      It is perfectly natural for him tohave met Republican. as well as Federalist leaders during his brief visit to Java, and since his purpose is, as Ihave said, to seek information and not to act as the instrument of policy, it would be very regrettable if attemptswere made to put any other construction upon his visit toBatavia or the contacts which he made there.I had hoped that the purpose of Sir William Strang&apos;stour had been made quite plain before he set out.     But ifit was not plain, I very much hope you will now explain theposition to your Government.Yours sincerely,(Signed)    ERNEST BEVINMr. V.K. Krishna Menon,High Commissioner for India.
