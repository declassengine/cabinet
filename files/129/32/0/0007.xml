/47 /(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. 0+9) 711TH JANUARYa 19U9CABINETINDONESIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State foeForeign, affairs attach a note on recent events arising out of theDutch military action in Indonesia,2. This note will show that we made great efforts toprevent the Dutch from taking this action.   In line with our policy throughout the whole of this affair, we used the full weight of our influence on the side of a fair and peaceful settlement.   We offered to use our influence also with the republican leaders where we thought that a refusal to meet theDutch on certain points was unreasonable and likely to make asettlement impossible.   We warned the Dutch of the very grave consequences to the whole position of the Western Powers inSouth East Asia which violent action on their part would provoke.   Until the last we had at least the partial support ofthe Dutch Foreign Minister, who v/as working on his colleagues in the Dutch Cabinet in favour of a peaceful settlement.   we failed, but we have no reason to regret our action or to feelthat we left anything undone which could have promoted theobject we had set ourselves.3* We now have to pursue the policy which may bestretrieve the situation in Indonesia and heal the breach which is rapidly developing between the East and the West on the subject,and of which the Indian Prime Minister&apos;s action in calling aconference without including or consulting us is a significantinstance.   The line on which I have been working, and which I am convinced is the only line possible for us, is to urge theDutch to meet the Security Council, which is now resuming itshearings in New York, first of all with a satisfactory statemen tregarding the cease fire and the release of the political prisoners, and secondly, and still more important, with a boldand statesmanlike plan involving the immediate formation of a comprehensive Interim Government (to include the Republic), theIIearly holding of elections to confirm that Government in office, and the transfer of power to an independent sovereignIndonesian Union on a fixed date.1+. Nothing less than an assurance of this nature willconvince the Security Council and the world that the Dutch meanto carry out their promises regarding independence forIndonesia.   But, if the Indonesians can be guaranteed that,within a fixed period, they will attain their independence and be able to choose their own leaders, our main object, andthe main object of the Security Council, will be achieved.COPY NO.3 I

5&apos; The Dutch have not gone the whole way to raeet us over this and I do not under-rate the difficulties.   But I thinkthat we can at least take credit for the fact that certainactions and declarations of theirs have at least shown a disposition to realise that a serious situation has arisen -notably the visit of the Dutch Prime Minister and the DutchAmbassador here to Indonesia and the Queenfs speech of6th January containing a re-affirmation of the intention ofthe Netherlands Government to establish a sovereign independentIndonesia, to set up an early federal government and to holdelections as soon as possible.   I have reason to believe thatthese actions have been due in no small degree to ourvigorous and plain speaking in The Hague.   We shall continue topress the Dutch Government to make more precise proposals andwe shall urge the Republican and other leaders, if occasion arises, to co-operate in the federal government as the best means of hastening the remaining stages of their independence.6. The attitude of the Security Council will depend on howfar the Netherlands Representative is able to meet the resolutions,which call for a cease.-fire and the release of the political prisoners.   Our Representative^ instructions are to concentrate on securing the implementation of the resolutions already passedand upon a constructive approach towards the final settlementof the problem.   At the same time he   has been instructed to be strongly critical of the Dutch failure to carry out the termsof the Security Council&apos;s resolution up to date.7. I should end, however, with a word of caution asregards action in the Security Council.    Our experience ofother disputes in the Council makes us doubtful of the wisdom of provoking a head-on collision between the Council and either party to a dispute.    Over Indonesia we have always haddoubts about challenging the Dutch contention that, in view oftheir sovereignty over Indonesia, admitted by the security council itself in the Renville Agreement, the Security councils not competent to pronounce upon the matter.   We must avoid committing ourselves on this point, and above all we must avoid committing ourselves to acting under Chapter VII of the charter and the prospect of sanctions, which it envisages.This would put us into the dilemma into which the Soviet union is only too anxious to push us, as their policy in theSecurity Council has demonstrated.8. I ask my colleagues to endorse the policy described in the preceding paragraphs.E.B.Foreign Office, S.W.I.,11th January, 1949.

NOTE BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS ONEVENTS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING AND FOLLOWING THE renewal of DUTCH MILITARY ACTION IN INDONESIA- Breakdown of NegotiationsWhen I saw the Dutch Foreign Minister in Paris inOctober he spoke to me with anxiety of the developments inIndonesia.   He told me that the Dutch could not accept thewhole of the plan put forward in September by the Americanmember of the Committee of Good Offices, Mr. Cochran.   To thebulk of it they had no serious objection, but there wereelements in it which, in their view, would undermine thesecurity of the country and their authority as the responsiblepower during the interim period.   I offered to speak, and didspeak, to Mr. Marshall on the subject but I also warnedMr. Stikker in strong terms against any kind of military action.2. Conversations thereafter proceeded between Mr. Cochranand H.M. Consul-General in Batavia, and on 22nd November theNetherlands Government sent a mission to Batavia, consistingof Mr. Stikker (Foreign Minister), Mr. Sassen (Minister of overseas Territories), and five Members of Parliamentrepresenting all Parties.   This mission returned to The Hagueon 7th December and reported failure to reach agreement withthe Republicans, in particular on the crucial matter of the powersof the Crown Representative and the control of the federal. (Indonesian) armies during the interim period.3- A serious point had obviously been reached.   we felt ourselves that these particular Dutch points had sanesubstance.   How to get round them was a matter of some difficulty,given the growing distrust between the Republicans and theDutch.   But, in the rather similar situation in India duringthe period of transfer, the Viceroy and Governor-General hadretained all his residual powers and the retention of these powers in some form seemed to us unavoidable.   In Indonesia therewere threats of communist outbreaks.   One such outbreak hadalready occurred.   It had been repressed by the Republicansthemselves, though &quot;at the cost of some compromise with pro-communist elements in Republican political circles.   but other outbreaks were possible.   Some safeguards had to be agreedupon if order and free expression of opinion were to be ensured during the difficult period of transition.   Over thefederal army, the main crux was the existence of the republican army, which had never been very amenable to discipline and which,as experience in Burma has shown, would constitute a definitethreat&apos;to peace and to the non-Republican elements in Indonesiaif it remained as a semi-private militia.h. When the Dutch issued their statement that negotiations had broken down, the Republican Government alsoissued a statement to the effect that their views and those ofthe Netherlands could not be reconciled.    The Dutch, on their side, complained with truth that the Republican Army showedless and loss disposition to respect the truce arrangedafter the Renville Agreement.   Dr. Hatta, the Republican PrimeMinister, thereupon wrote a letter (on lhth December) to Mr.Cochran, to be passed to the Netherlands Government, suggesting,on his personal authority, a compromise on the points demanded by the Dutch.   Opinion, however, was hardening in the DutchCabinet.    The latter regarded this communication as

prevaricatory ana insincere and replied by a note toMr. Co oh. ran in most unf orthcoming tones, requesting an assurance that these views were the views of the UnitedRepublican Cabinet as a preliminary to further discussion.   they also demanded, as a further condition of discussions,  the cessation of breaches of the truce.   Mr. Stikker personallyrequested us to persuade Dr. Hatta to give these assurances,despite the uncompromising tone of the Dutch note, which he himself deplored.   He did not inform us, however, - he wasignorant of the fact when he made the appeal - that the Dutchnote had been accompanied by a time-limit which made a replyvirtually impossible.   No reply was in fact received andmilitary action began immediately (on 18th December);    theDutch defending their action in particular on the continuedinfringements of the truce by the Republicans and the latter&apos;slack of intention to reach agreement, as evidence of which theycited the announced intention of the President and part of theCabinet to proceed to India.5. The Security^council was immediately summoned by theUnited States and Australian Governments, as members of theCommittee of Good Offices.   The United States Delegate intro-duced a resolution calling on both parties to cease fire, andto withdraw to their previous positions, and upon the Committeeof Good Offices to report on the situation by telegraph.The United Kingdom Representative on the Council was instructedto support the&apos; American resolution, and to express the hopethat the Committee of Good Offices would report fully on thecircumstances leading to the breakdown.   In the event, theAmerican resolution was passed (2ij-th December) with an australian addition calling for the immediate release of thepolitical prisoners, but without that section which called for the withdrawal.    That section failed to pass, partly,paradoxically enough,  owing to the abstention of the soviet and the absence of the Ukrainian delegate.   The Soviet delegatesubsequently proposed a more extreme resolution, containingvarious undesirable elements, which failed to pass theCouncil.6. The Council finally adjourned on 30th december to reassemble in New York, having passed three resolutions -the American resolution already mentioned and two subsidiaryresolutions.   The texts of all three motions are appended.It met in New York on 7th January and, after an inconclusivedebate, agreed to meet again on 11th January.
