THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted, for the Cabinet   January 1949 ,-.   &apos; \-SECRET    ..CP. (49) 15 *j20*A January, 1949 .. - ^       **CABINETRESUMPTION OF AUSTRIAN TREATY negotiations memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in the papers which I circulated to the Overseas Reconstruction Committeeon 24th November, 1947 (O.R.C. (47) 47), and to the Cabinet on 4th January, 1948(OP. (48) 9), I set out the position regarding the Austrian Treaty immediately before and after the fifth session of the Council of Foreign Ministers held inLondon from 25th November, 1946, to 18th February; 1947. As was stated inthe second of these papers, which was considered at the Cabinet meeting of8th January, 1948 (CM. (48) 2nd Conclusion? Minute 4), the Foreign Ministers&apos;Deputies were due to meet in London early in 1948 with a view if possible toconcluding the Treaty, on the basis of a proposal which I myself had putforward at the end of the Conference, and of a promised Soviet counter-proposal.2. The Deputies duly met in London on 20th February, 1948, and continued in session until 6th May, when the negotiations were suspended indefinitely.Now, after an interval of several months, it seems probable that they will resume their meetings here in February. The purpose of this memorandum is to informthe Cabinet very briefly of the history of this latest phase of the protractednegotiations on the Austrian Treaty, and to set out the present position, withsome indication of the prospects.3. As I explained in the memorandum of 4th January, 1948, M, Molotovwas induced at the very end of the last meeting of the Council of foreign ministers to accept the principle of a proposal put forward by the french delegation, and supported by the United Kingdom and United States, for a&quot;concrete &quot; solution of the German Assets problem. The figures in the Sovietcounter-proposal, mentioned in paragraph 4 of that paper, turned put to beroughly double those put forward, by the French; it was obvious that there wouldhave to be much hard bargaining to bridge the gap, and that the Soviet wouldhave to make substantial concessions if Austria were to have any chance ofattaining independence and prosperity. By painfully slow degrees we did infact get nearer to agreement, until the stage was reached where the principaloutstanding differences were (a) the Soviet claim to 60 per cent, of the totalof the undeveloped oil prospecting areas in Eastern Austria, as against the47 per cent, offered by the Western Powers; and (b) the Soviet demand fora lump sum payment of 150 million dollars over six years for the residual&quot; German Assets,&quot; whereas the Western Powers were not prepared to agreeto an amount appreciably higher than 100 million dollars over seven years.There were a number of other points still to be cleared up, but these were themain fields of disagreement. The Western Powers felt that they had virtuallyreached the limit of their concessions, and in default of any abatement of theSoviet claim it was difficult to see how further progress could be made.4. The Deputies accordingly turned to the other unagreed Articles of theTreaty, giving particular attention to those embodying claims by Yugoslaviato territory and reparations. In Annex A to O.R.C. (47) 47 I made it clearthat we regarded both these claims as indefensible, and could not agree to anypart of them being granted. After the lengthy hearing of a Yugoslav Delegation,during which these claims were re-stated with only a minor reduction in the36459
territory demanded in Carinthia, the Western Powers strongly re-asserted theirattitude and called on the Soviet Government to abandon their support of the yugoslav claims. Failing agreement on these fundamentals, it was felt, thatcontinued negotiations on the Treaty could hardly be profitable. The Soviet^Deputy was not, however, authorised to withdraw his support, and after incon-clusive exchanges the meetings were suspended.5. At the beginning of December last the Austrian Government addressed a note to each of the Four Occupying Powers drawing attention to its unimpaireddesire for the conclusion of a Treaty and the withdrawal of Allied forces,, and asking them to seek a basis on which the Treaty negotiations could usefully be resumed. The response of the Powers was favourable, and the United StatesDeputy, as next Chairman, then proposed a resumption of the meetings in london on or about 7th February, 1949. Both the United Kingdom and French Deputieshave agreed to this proposal, and although Soviet concurrence is still awaitedI do not think there will be objection from that side either.6. There are still nearly 20 unagreed Articles of the Treaty, but themain issues outstanding are those I have mentioned, namely, the &quot; German Assets &quot;settlement and the Yugoslav claims. Since it was expressly on the latter question that the Deputies meetings were suspended last May, they will presumably haveto start again at that point. While I do not believe that these Yugoslav claimsmean anything more to the Soviet, ultimately, than a bargaining-counter, I amhot optimistic as to the chances of securing any early assurance of their readiness to withdraw support for them. (There does not seem to me very much in thecurrent speculations as to the possibility of a change in the Soviet attitude beingrendered likely by the Tito-Cominform dispute.) I think that the Russians willbe anxioUs to get the discussion back to German Assets, in which they are primarilyinterested, and Will try as before to\extract the maximum concessions here before giving way on any of the other main outstanding questions. Naturally we shalldo our best not to let them dictate the course of negotiations, while at the sametime avoiding a deadlock so long as there seems to be any chance of progress;7. I feel no more able now than I was a year ago to prophesy regarding the willingness of the Russians to conclude an Austrian Treaty^ on tolerable terms and-to withdraw their forces from the country. The Austrian problem iscertainly for them only part of the general and strategic situation in Europe.I would only say that nearly four years of occupation of Austria have not brought the Soviet anything like the success they hoped to gain, and it may well be thatthey are more ready now than previously to explore alternative&apos; possibilities,including the general evacuation of Allied forces. But whatever their tactics,they will undoubtedly try to secure all the advantages they can in the Treaty itself&apos;.E. BForeign Office, S.W. 1,20th January, 1949.
