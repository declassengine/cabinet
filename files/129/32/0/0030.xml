S. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,17th February, 1949.ECONOMIC  report . Man-power the total number of persons in civil employment declined by 63,000 during december. There was a fall of 47,000 in the number of women at work and arise, mainly seasonal, in unemployment.2. In the manufacturing industries there was a decrease of 20,000 inDecember. Employment was lower in all the main industrial groups, excepttextiles.3. Over the year 1948, the total number in civil employment rose by 265,000.The manufacturing industries gained 93,000, compared with a rise of 74,000assumed in the Economic Survey for 1948, and the basic industries (mining,agriculture, fishing, transport, shipping and public utilities) gained 77,000.Although there was a reduction of 10,000 in the numbers engaged in consumers&apos;services, man-power in distribution rose by 55,000. The Public Service (including -local government) increased by 57,000. The number of persons unemployed roseby only 48,000 compared with the rise of 150,000 assumed in the Economic Survey.Over two-thirds of the 180,000 by which the industrial population exceeded the survey figure was due to an unexpected increase in the number of women taking up, or remaining at work.Change in Man-power from December 1947 to December 1948Basic industriesManufacturing industriesBuilding and civil engineeringDistribution...Consumers&apos; services       ...Public serviceTotal in civil employmentUnemployed       ...Total industrial population	Assumed in actual	Economic SurveyThousands	Thousands4- 77	4-1234- 93 ,: 1	4- 74-   7   i	-164-4- 55	- 31- 10	4-   3-f- 57 &apos;,	- 224-265	- 174- 48	4-1504-313	4-1333136563b
II. Production4. The index of total industrial production (1946 = 100) rose to the seasonalpeak of 129 in November. This was: 6 points above the index for November 1947.The index for manufacturing industries rose to 132 in November.5. Production declined in December owing to the holidays.. The index forthe fourth quarter of 1948 is provisionally estimated at 126, compared with 119for the fourth quarter of 1947. Production for the whole year 1948 was about21 per cent, higher than in 1946.Interim Index of Industrial Production(1946 = 100)	All industries				Manufacturing industries			1947	1948	Increase		1947	1948	increase may	109	117	4-	8	111	119	4- 8June    .........	114	124	4-	10	116	127	4-11July     ...	107	113	4-	6	109	115	&apos; 4-6August.........	104	110	-1-	6	105	112	4- 7   .September......	115	126	+ 11		117	130	4-13.October        ......	120	127	4-	7	122	129	4- 7November     ......	123	129	4-	6	123	132	4- 9December      .......	115				115		Coal6. Production of deep-mined coal recovered, after the holidays, to 4-06million tons in the second week of January and, since then, has been runningslightly higher at about 4 08 million tons a week. Although output since november 1948 has been only about 2-3 per cent, greater than in the correspondingperiod since November 1947, when the extra hours agreement came into force,there has been a steady, though small, improvement during the last four months.Output of Deep-mined Coal(weekly averages)   /	1947^18 Th. tons	1948-49 Th. tons	Change Per cent.November December to mid-January         ......

Since the middle of January average weekly output has been 3 - 3 per cent,greater than in the corresponding period of last year. This was due to moreworkers at the coal face and higher output per man shift. Absence from work,however, is still high.Man-power, Absence from Work and Productivity at the Coal FaceWorkers atcoal face(thousands)1948        1949Absence from work at coal face(per cent.)1948 1949Output per man-shift at coal face(tons)1948        1949January2nd week3rd. week4th weekFebruary1st week13-4313-9114-6214-6913-9614-4614-6214-962-932-902-942-912-972-983-002-98
Iron and steel8. The output of steel ingots and castings recovered to an average of305,000 tons a week in the last fortnight of January. Stocks of scrap continueto rise and stocks of pig-iron, which declined in January, are expected to increase to Over 500,000 tons by the end of March.Textiles ...9. Cotton yarn production made a slow recovery after the holidays and inthe last week of January had risen only to 18*22 million ^8.-^1633 than in october and November/10. Although production of worsted yarn was 18 per cent, greater in 1948than in 1947, and output of woven wool fabrics 15 per cent, greater, output rosevery slowly during 1948.11. Production of rayon yarn in December was only slightly below the peakreached in November and total output for the yfear was only 1 - 3 per cent, lessthan the &quot;target.&quot; Output of staple fibre, however, showed no improvementduring 1948 and was weir below the target set; it is expected to increase during1949 as a result of the factory reorganisation during 1948.Motor vehicles12. Although motor vehicle production in December was affected by the holidays, the output of large passenger care (Over 2,200 cg.) rose further to 862a week. Of these 521 a week were produced for the export market comparedwith an average of 124 a week in the first quarter of the year. The number of smaller cars produced for export declined during the year.Weekly Output of Large Passenger Cars (including Chassis)(over 2,200 c.c.)Number	Total	For home market	For export1948 1st Quarter   ......	^ ^. .-\	106	1242nd Quarter   ....	280	112	1683rd Quarter   ..;	501	233	268October	833	346	487November	843	336	507December	862	341	521			13. Although the total Value of exports of passenger cars (including chassis)has shown no further improvement since the second quarter of 1948, the propor-tion of these exports going to the United States and Canada rose to 21 per ceiit;in the last quarter of the year. The value of exports of commercial vehicles rose from  2,486,000 a month during the first quarter of 1948 to  3,361,000 a month in the last quarter. Exports of commercial vehicles to the United States and canada, which were negligible in 1947, increased to  188,000 a month in thelast qtiarter Of 1948.Exports of all Passenger Cars (including Chassis)(monthly averages)  thousand	Total to all countries	To United States	To Canada1948 1st  Quarter   ...	4,575	286	522nd Quarter   ......	5,582	360	251         .3rd Quarter ....	4,697	593	4334th Quarter   ...	5,233	634	46036563			b 2
III.^-Building14. The number of new permanent houses (excluding aluminium houses)completed rose in December to 18,180-just above the average for the year. Thenumber of new houses started declined to 13,673 and the number under constructionfell further to 187,836 compared with 252,988 under construction at the endof 1947.15. During the last quarter of 1948 new contracts were greater than thenumber of houses completed. The number on contract but not started rose from52,063 to 65,221.IY. Agriculture16. Autumn sowings of wheat were affected adversely by the delayedharvesting of grain and the heavy crops of potatoes and sugar-beet. It isestimated that only 1 - 58 million acres in England and Wales had been sown withwheat by 4th December, 1948, compared with 2-02 million acres on 4th December,1947. The target wheat acreage for England and Wales in 1949 is 2-34 million 150,000 acres more than the final acreage sown by June 1948. In order toreach this target 760,000 acres must be sown between December and June.Acreage of Wheat in England and Wales(million acres)Final acreageSown by at 4th June of4&apos;th December following year1942 ............ 3-08 3-281945 .........      ... 1-84 1-981946 .........      ... 1-86 2-071947 .........      ... 2-02 2-191948 ............ 1-58 2-34 (target)Y. Food17. Consumption per head of most foods has increased since 1946. Theconsumption of potatoes has declined as a result of the general improvement indiet and the increased supplies of bread, but consumption of meat and bacon andof cheese was still lower than in 1946.18. Consumption of flour, potatoes, sagsr, fish, fruit and vegetables and milk was higher in 1948 than before the war. Consumption of meat and baconwas about one-third lower than before the war, and consumption of rationedfats, eggs and cheese was also lower.Consumption per Head of Certain Foods in the United Kingdom	Pre-war	1946	1947	1948	- Change	Change &apos;	lb.	lb.	lb.	lb.	pre-war to	1946 to	per head	per head	per head	per head	1948	-  1948					Per cent.

YI.-External Trade19. There are still no signs of any slackening in the expansion of exports. Provisional figures of the value of British exports in January 1949show a further substantial rise from  145-7 million in December to  159-million a new record. The index of volume of these exports (1938 = 100) isprovisionally estimated to be 160-162 per cent, of 1938, compared with 147 in thelast quarter of 1948 and 128 in January 1948.tndem of Volume of British Exports(1938 ^ 100)1947: 1st quarter 2nd Quarter3rd quarter 4th Quarter1948: 1st quarter 2nd Quarter3rd quarter 4th Quarter1949: January101102114118126134138147160-16220. The value of total imports also rose in J^W^-^^iT^: 1-6 million more than the previous highest figure in July 1948. The visibleadverS balance of trade declined further. for the fifth ^^^Wbg 22-9 million in January-the lowest level since July 1946. The adverse vwiDiebalance with the Western Hemisphere countries increased f^^^^J^^in December. There was a further increase m the &quot;adverse balance potherSn sterling countries and a significant rise in the favourable balance with the sterling area.Visible Balance of Traded)(monthly average in   million)	Total all countries	Western hemisphere-sphere	Other non-sterling countries	Sterling area					British colonies .

Although the value of British exports was almost 40 per cent, greater in 1948 than in 1947 there has been only a small increase in the proportion goingto &quot;Western Hemisphere countries. In the last quarter of 1948, 17-4,per cent,of British exports went to these countries compared with 16 per cent, in thecorresponding period of 1947. On the other hand, the proportion of our importsfrom the Western Hemisphere declined from 43-3 to 32-0 per cent, over the sameperiod.   &apos; .

Balance of Payments		22. Once again the first month of the quarter has produced a low figure for the gold and dollar deficit. In January it amounted to only  19 million,smaller than in any month since 1946. This compares With  25 million inDecember and  46 million in November 1948.23. The January rate is substantially below expectations for the first quarteras a whole. There is no evidence that expenditure on imports has been materiallyless than the programme and it is unlikely that increased exports will havemade much difference. On the other hand, net drawings by the rest of the sterling area appear to have been rather light and Colonial earnings, particularly fromcocoa and tin, have probably been running at a higher level than was expected.24. We lost  3 million ($11 million) to Belgium in January in settlementof the adverse sterling area balance,  1^ million ($6 million) to the Bizone, and 1 million ($4 million) to,Indonesia in settlement for trade between indonesia and the United States conducted through Singapore in the first half of 1948.25. Reimbursements during January by the United States Economic Cb-operation Administration amounted to  23 million ($93 million) in respect ofthe United Kingdom and  f million ($2-9 million) in respect of. Eire. (Thiswas the first amount received by Eire. There has since been a further  1 million($3-7 million).) We also made our first monthly drawing of  2^ million($10 million) on the Canadian Credit. Finally, India has drawn  6 million($24 million) on the International Monetary Fund in the first half of February.As a result of all these transactions and a low dollar deficit, gold and dollarholdings by the Exchange Equalisation Account have been increased and at themiddle of February were about  471 million, or  14 million more than at theend of December.YIIL-^prices import and export prices26. The index numbers of import and export prices both rose in Deceiiib&amp;rby about \ per cent., leaving the terms of trade unchanged.Retail prices &apos;    *27. The interim index of retail prices (June 1947 = 100) for all itemscombined remained unchanged in December at 109. The index of food pricesremained at 108. Clothing prices are still rising slowly and an increase of16 per cent, in electricity charges raised the index for fuel and light from 112to 114.Wholesale prices28. The index of wholesale prices of food and tobacco showed no significant change in January and remains below the peak reached in June 1948. Theindices of basic materials, intermediate products and manufactured goods continueto rise slowly. During 1948 tha pressure of rising prices of basic materials on prices at later stages of manufacture was intensified: Prices of basic materialsrose sharply during the first half of the year and by December were 20 - 2 per cent,higher than in December 1947. Prices of intermediate products, however, roseby only 6-2 per cent, and prices of manufactured goods by 9-1 per cent.
Prices in the United States29. American commodity prices continue tp weaken, Moody&apos;s index ofstaple commodity prices (31st December, 1931 * 100) fell from 391 at the beginningof January to 37(8 on 16th February, This compares with 407 a year ago, and459 at the end of 1947. Prices of farm products are now lower than in February1947 and many have fallen to the levels at which they will be supported by theloan programme of the American Government. Prices of metals and mineralsare higher than in February 1947; there has been a fall in prices of steel scrapin recent weeks.IX,-Wage Rates30. The Ministry of Labour&apos;s index of weekly wage rates (June 1947 = 100)rose one point in January to 108.31, Increases in wage rates which became effective during December addedapproximately  33,000 to the weekly wages of about 159,000 workers. The mostimportant increase was in the bleaching, dyeing and finishing sections of the textile industry and followed the increases in other sections of the textile industry which took place earlier in the year.32. The most important new claim presented in December was one for anincrease of 6s. a week for adult workers in the food industry. The claim hasbeen rejected by the employers and will probably be referred to arbitration.33. The claims put forward by the National Union of Mineworkers forincreased cost-of-living scale payments, and for an extra week&apos;s paid holiday,have been rejected by the National Coal Board.34. The agricultural workers&apos; claim was considered by the agricultural wages Board on 27th January. The Board recommended an increase of 4s. aweek in the minimum wage for adult men with proportionate increases for women and juveniles; a reduction in the working week from 48 to 47 hours, and anincrease in paid annual holidays from 6 to 7 days.X. European Recovery ProgrammeVisit to Washington.- 35. A delegation from O.E.E.C., including the British Chairman of the,Executive Committee, has been in Washington at the invitation of E.C.A. toassist in the interpretation of the O.E.E.C. Interim Report on the Long-term programme and the O.E.E.C. Report on the 1949-50 Prograinme. These reports are important material in the preparation of the United States Administration^case for Congress, when a fresh appropriation is sought to cover the period april 1949-June 1950. The visit has enabled the O.E.E.C. delegation to get a clearer impression of the measures E.C.A will press the participating countries to adopt during the year 1949-50.Mr. Hoffman&apos;s Six-Point Programme36. In his statement before Congress on 8th February, Mr. Hoffman laiddown a Six-point Programme on major readjustments that the countries ofEurope would have to make. This included the necessity for increasing exports,decreasing imports, developing intra-European trade, and the development of new sources of supply. The other two points were: first, the necessity for renewedefforts to stabilise currencies and to check inflation by increased and more effectivetaxes, balanced budgets, and balanced investment programmes ;&apos;and, secondly, theneed to exchange full information concerning investment plans and needs so thatinvestors, whether private or governmental, may be able to make their investmentdecisions in the light of all the facts and thus reduce to a minimum themisdirection of resources. The United Kingdom is already carrying out thefirst five points of Mr. Hoffman&apos;s programme.1949-1950 Programme37. E.C.A. has tentatively suggested an allotment for the United Kingdomof $940 million, the figure we submitted to Paris. The final figure depends on discussions at O.E.E.C. after the total appropriation has been voted; even then the final division of aid must be formally accepted by E.C.A.
Structure of O.E.E.C.38. O.E.E.C. now faces the task of dealing more firmly with long-term issues,decisions on which will have significant effects on the economies of the partici-pating countries. A Ministerial Committee comprising the eight countries repre-sented on the Executive Committee and Eire is now meeting to review the structure of O.E.E.C. The United Kingdom view is that to undertake its future work O.E.E.C. requires stronger ministerial guidance. This would be besteffected by means of a small ministerial group which would help the Chairman ofthe Council to guide the work of the organisation between regular meetings of theCouncil. It is suggested that this group should consist 01 Ministers from theUnited Kingdom, France, Italy and Sweden. Further, the United Kingdom view is that the Executive Committee (comprising at present the United Kingdom,France, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and Netherlands) should be recognised as the body where the day-to-day work of O.E.E.C. should be planned&apos; and wherepolicy decisions should be formulated and co-ordinated. Below it, general economic questions should be handled by the existing Programmes Committee (which hasa United Kingdom Chairman) on which all countries are represented.1952-1953 Programmes39. As a result of reconsideration of our own 1952-53 Programme, certain changes have been made in our import programme which will make it more acceptable to other O.E.E.C. countries whilst maintaining the existing balance ofpayments surplus. Few changes have been necessary in our own investment programme. A study of other long-term programmes, however, shows that drastic changes in imports, exports and investment policy will be required if some countries are to achieve viability by 1952-53.
