THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 1949SECRET Cbpy No. 3CP. (49) 2715th February, 1949CABINETEUROPEAN ECONOMIC  CO-operation the  EUROPEAN LONG-TERM  programme memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate herewith, for the consideration of my colleagues, a report bythe European Economic Co-operation Committee on the European long-term programme.2. This report has been considered by the Official Committee on economic development and by the Economic Planning Board.3. The Official Committee on Economic Development expressed generalagreement with the proposals made in the report, and made various suggestions which have been incorporated in it.  The main points which they stressed were : (a) Section I. Recovery of Western europe the Committee did not dissent from the view that it is possible for western europe (with the exception of certain countries) to become viable by 1952-53,but wished to emphasise the magnitude of the task and the optimistic natureof the assumptions made. The whole plan depended upon success in carryingout internal financial reforms and applying essential controls, e.g., import and exchange control. This presented great political difficulties and also might be quite beyond the competence of some administrations. These considerations,however, made it more important to follow the policies proposed, if economicindependence was to be achieved.(6) Section II. Impact upon the United KingdomThe Committee felt that Ministers should be left in no doubt that the UnitedKingdom Government must be prepared to modify their own programme on thesame lines as they recommend for other European countries. While on our ownassumptions we consider that our plan stands up well, there would undoubtedly be considerable pressure by the other participating countries for modifications in particular fields.The Committee also wished to stress the importance of a realistic screeningof the needs of the participating countries. It emerged quite clearly from an examination of the reports that all the participating countries would be seeking to purchase in non-dollar sources of supply; This would have three effects. First,it might endanger the supplies on which the United Kingdom itself was counting.Secondly, it would put up the prices of supplies in non-dollar areas. And, finally,supplies might be drawn by Europe from non-dollar sources which we are countingupon selling to the dollar area. For all these reasons the realistic screening of requirements was of the first importance.(c) Section III. Revision of United Kingdom Long-term programme the Committee took note that the dollar position in 1952-53 now lookedconsiderably less favourable than had been thought at the time our long-term programme was drawn up.   Further, they wished to stress that the assumptions
upon which we were relying to establish dollar viability as set out in paragraph 55are extremely optimistic. The Committee did not wish to recommend a detailedre-examination of our programme, but thought that Ministers should be warned that our programmed supplies were by no means secure. We should intensify our efforts to save and earn more dollars.id) Section IV. The Impact on the commonwealth the Committee attached great importance to the problems dealt with underthis section and noted that a further detailed memorandum would be submitted.In particular the Canadian position would need further careful thought in thelight of a more detailed appreciation.(e) Section V. Proposals for Action at O.E.E.C.The Committee, in agreeing generally with the proposals in this section, feltthat the timing of our discussions with E.C.A., and in particular the other european countries, would want most careful consideration. It would be fatal to the prospects of getting a plan of this nature seriously considered if there werepremature leakages. The danger of leakages arose mainly from discussions withother European countries, and they therefore felt than any such discussions shouldtake place at as short an interval&quot; as possible before our proposals were formallyput forward to the Organisation, and should be in general terms.4. The Economic Planning Board generally approved the document as abasis for the brief for the United Kingdom Delegation and suggested certain changes which have been incorporated in the paper. They wished the attentionof Ministers to be drawn to the precarious nature of the dollar balance of theUnited Kingdom in 1952-53, and hence the limited extent to which the UnitedKingdom could make concessions to the other participating countries withoutjeopardising its own position. They considered that the other participating countries had provided insufficient evidence about the proposals for &quot; integration &quot;of the economies of Western Europe and recommended therefore that the positionof the United Kingdom on this point should be reserved. They recommended thatthe United Kingdom should not offer to reduce the production target for coalduring the first round of discussions within the O.E.E.C. and that, if sueha reduction had to be effected at a later stage, it should fall upon the opencasttarget and the target for deep-mined coal should not be altered (paragraph 63).In the case of steel, the board considered it undesirable that the United Kingdomsteel development programme should be reduced (paragraph 69). *5. There are two points on which it has not been possible to reach agreement at the official level: (a) Coarse grain imports (paragraph 62);(b) Ministry of Food reservation on import programme (paragraph 74,et seq.).In both cases the general view, both on the Official Committee and the planning Board, has been contrary to the Departmental view.6. The report was, of course, prepared before Mr. Hoffman had made his statement to Congress.   This contained six main points:-&quot; (i) They (the countries of Europe) must make renewed efforts to stabilisecurrencies and to check inflation. The year 1949 should be the year offinancial and fiscal stabilisation of Europe. This requires increased and more effective taxes, balanced budgets, balanced investment programmes.(ii) They must increase exports by increasing productivity per man-hour, bylowering prices, and by improving marketing techniques.(iii) They must make much&apos; greater efforts to develdp, at home, in their overseas territories, and in other countries, new sources of supply for those imports which Europe will not be able to afford to buy in dollars.(iv) They must make a much greater effort to develop intra-European trade.This objective will require drastic changes from traditional patterns.It is going to require European Governments to agree on plans tobreak down tariff barriers, to build customs unions, and to modifyimmigration barriers to permit the sensible deployment of labour.
(V) They must exchange full information concerning their respective invest-ment plans and needs, so that investors, whether private or Govern-mental, may be able to make their investment decisions in the lightof all the facts, and thus reduce to a minimum the misdirection of resources.(vi) They must alsb further curtail imports that are not vitally needed.They must forestall the danger or drastic and sudden reduction ofimports when the European Recovery Programme ends.&quot;In the light pf this statement we should expect to receive the support of points (i), (ii), (v) and (vi) are entirely in accordance with the views put forward.It may be felt that on point (iii) increased production our approach is nega-tive. This, however, is not the case. What the proposals seek to ensure is thatwe get the greatest possible production within the limit of the resources available.Even after the proposed reductions have been made there will be great increases in production, but not such great increases as envisaged in the original plans.This would be made clear when our proposals are put forward. The first sectionof point (iv) also fits in generally with our ideas, but there will be differences of view on the second section.I am myself in broad agreement with the general line taken in the report,though I do not necessarily agree with every detailed recommendation.E.C.A. in putting forwardreport attached.R.

DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  majesty&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRETThe European Long-Term ProgrammeReport by the European Economic Co-operation CommitteeTOWARDS the end of February the O.E.E.C. will resume its work of preparing a joint recovery programme for the 19 participating countries.The Interim Report was published at the end of December; since then, Govern-ments have been considering it; the discussions in O.E.E.C. in the next fewmonths will show how much substance there is in the idea of European economic co-operation, and what progress can be made.2. For the reasons set out in E.P.C. (49) 6, it is necessary for the UnitedKingdom to take the lead at this stage, and even to run some degree of riskin the hope of restoring Western Europe. But it is laid down in E.P.C. (49) 6,which was approved by the Economic Policy Committee on 26th January(E.P.C. (49), 5th Meeting, Minute 2), that in doing this we must do nothing which would damage irretrievably the economic structure of this country. this paper is framed according to this dual instruction.3. This paper is the result of comprehensive analysis of the long-termprogrammes submitted by the participating countries to O.E.E.C., and of the interim Report of O.E.E&quot;C.; it takes into account the discussions at the meetingof Commonwealth Prime Ministers in October and during the Chancellor of theExchequer^ visit to Canada; it seeks to pull together all the strands of long-term economic policy.  The paper is in five parts :-I. A programme for the recovery of Western Europe.II. The impact upon the United Kingdom.III. Revision of the United Kingdom long-term programme.IV. The impact upon the Commonwealth.V.-Proposals for action at O.E.E.C.4. At the outset, we must emphasise that this paper deals with the long-term programme-the course of action which we and other countries must follow inorder to be independent of United States aid by 1952-53. In order to measure the size of the problem and illustrate the scale of remedial action which is required;it is necessary to make statistical estimates, based upon assumptions which are bound in the event to prove false. It is impossible now, either for the UnitedKingdom or for the other participants, to decide what will happen, in 1952-53.The point of the analysis is to assess what is possible, and to show what isimpossible on any reasonable prediction about the future. With this guide,present action can be directed along the right lines; action which worsens thelong-term prospect can be avoided; the public&apos;s expectations can be kept within areasonable distance of what can in fact be achieved.5. We must further emphasise that wherever proposals are made for action the participating countries, or for review of policies by O.E.E.C., we mustbe prepared to take action on the same lines ourselves and to have our own policiesreviewed and scrutinised at O.E.E.C. We cannot stand in. a special position inany respect.I. The Recovery of Western Europe6. The Interim Report of O.E.E.C. showed the scale of the problem whichconfronts the participating countries. In 1947 they paid for less than 40 per cent,of their imports from the outside world; in 1948-49 they hope to pay for about half. In 1952-53 they have to pay for all their imports. The Report advocatesa three-pronged attack on the problem, by expansion of exports (especially to north America), development of new sources of supply, and rigorous import
saving. The Report estimates that, even on the most favourable view of exportprospects and the most determined export drive, the participating countries willbe able to afford only 85-90 per cent, ot the imports they are expecting in 1952-53,and only 75 per cent, of the imports from North America.7. The position of the Continental countries is much less favourable, forthe total O.E.E.C. figures are heavily weighted by the inclusion of the UnitedKingdom, which showed itself in balance in its. long-term programme. Thesecountries provided in their programmes for imports of $9,600 million from the outside world (including f2,400 million from North America); we estimate thatthey cannot hope to afford more than $7,700 million (including only $1,400million from North America). In order to be self-sustaining without aid, afterpressing exports to the maximum possible, they must arrange their economiesso that they need 20 per cent, less imports than they now expect to need, and do without nearly half their projected imports from North America. This is,the scale of their problem.8. We have examined each country&apos;s position in order to form an opinionof what it would have to do in order to become &apos;&apos; viable &quot; i.e. able to existat a tolerable standard of living without external aid-by 1952-53. Following arethe assumptions: (i) no O.E.E.C. country should plan on the assumption that it will beable to earn gold or dollars from other O.E.E.C. countries in 1952-53;with certain specific exceptions (see paragraphs 24-26 below) eachmust therefore bring itself into balance by 1952-53, both with north america and with the rest of the world;(ii) the United States of America assists recovery, not only by giving enoughaid, but by allowing imports from Continental O.E.E.C. countries to grow to more than double the present rate;(iii) trade with Eastern Europe and the U.S.S.R. grows to about pre-warvolume (nearly double the present rate);(iv) some worsening of the terms of trade a necessary assumption, forthe-Continentals&apos; export prices are in general far higher than oursand other competitors&apos;;(v) no further increase in the amount of resources devoted to nationaldefence.9. Judged by these criteria, very little revision is called for in the UnitedKingdom programme; the concessions which would be most helpful to the other.E.E.C. countries are described in Section II below, and our recommendations for revision are given in Section III. We had taken account of these criteriawhen drawing up our long-term programme, and the other countries, on thewhole, had not done so. That is why the changes in theirs must be greater thanthose in ours.10. Each country has been treated on its merits, but there are many commonstrands running through the whole which are points of general Western Euro-pean application. The basic problem is the same for every country, and, whilst the amount of adjustment needed differs from country to country, the generaltype of ad j ustment is the same. It is designed to reduce the total imports of thegroup from North America by 40-45 per cent, of their stated needs for 1952-53*The distribution of these programmed imports is as follows : Imports programmed from North and Central America for 1952-53Per cent.Food and feeding-stuffs    ...      ... ...      ...      30Tobacco      .............   ....      ......       %\Oil and products......      ...      ......      ....      16Copper        ...      .........      ....      ......       2gOther non-ferrous metals  ..............      ...       4.&apos;   -      Cotton ...      ...      ......   .   ...      ......      13Vehicles and equipment    ...      ...      ...      ...      ....      16Other .        ...      ...      ....      ...      ...      ...      ...      16* Detailed statistics are shown in Tables I and II of Appendix II.
11. Food. The general line is to cut back livestock expansion programmes(especially pigs and poultry, which, depend upon imports of coarse grains) concen-trating upon the production of bread grains and root crops, in order to getthe maximum amount of basic food for humans produced. If the very rapidplanned expansions of livestock are allowed to take place now, financed withMarshall aid, catastrophe will confront the O.E.E.C. countries when they nolonger have the purchasing power to buy imported coarse grains on the scalerequired to support the expanded pig and poultry populations, The effect of this,coupled with reduction of imports of meat and fats, must be to slow down theimprovement in the diet.12. Nevertheless, consumption would in general be considerably better in1952-53 than now, and normally little below pre-war in nutritional terms, althoughmonotonous. This is perhaps the most important (and difficult) single series of proposals. If these countries (particularly tfenelux and the Bizone) ,can be induced to concentrate upon producing basic foods for humans first, leaving thegrowth of livestock to come rater, their food supply in 1952-53 can be assured.But this will be an unpalatable policy for farmers, who find it more profitableto grow food for animals, and it will be very difficult for Governments to imposethis policy. [If we emphasise the food and agriculture problem, we must beprepared to defend our own policies in detail;. they stand up reasonably well irithis context.]13. Energy. Almost all O.E.E.C. countries are envisaging a rapid expansion of oil consumption the 1952-53 programmes provide for nearly double pre-war consumption. This is in many cases coupled with large projects of oil refining. About half the consumption comes from dollar sources, and this represents about one-sixth of their total dollar bill. We consider that thereis no possibility that most of the countries &quot;will be able to afford dollar oil on anything like this scale, and it is proposed that the rate of expansion of oilconsumption should be halved; this would still leave consumption in 1952-53 at50 per cent, above pre-war and above the current level. This, too, is a difficulteconomy to achieve, for once the use of oil is established in transport or industry,it is necessary to meet requirements in order to prevent breakdown of essential services. So action must be taken now to prevent the further expansion. [Ourown oil policy, which envisages an expansion of consumption of about 20 percent, above the present level to about double pre-war, may be criticised on this score, but can be justified because we are producers of oil; however, the proposals to restrict European consumption have implications for us, see paragrapn 64 below.J14. Industry. In general we recommend a lowering of the sights on industrial investment programmes, in order that expansion projects should notbe begun and then left unfinished because too much is being attempted at once.There are special problems of the cotton, wool and rayon textile industries, whichcountries are seeking to expand far beyond their capacity to afford or procureraw materials, and far beyond their possibilities of exporting; the expansionof the engineering industry is likely to be held up by shortage of non-ferrous metals, especially copper. There are supply difficulties as well as financial difficulties in getting enough raw material to run the expanded industries whichmost countries expect to have; it is, therefore, necessary to slow down the rateof expansion. If countries can tackle their investment programmes in this way,they will in fact achieve a bigger and better balanced expansion in the time than would otherwise be possible. . We propose that the adjustment of investment programmes should be specially directed to clear the way for dollar-saving and dollar-earning projects. [The shortage of important raw materials, e.g., non-dollar cotton, wool, copper has implications for United Kingdom, see para-graphs 35-37 below.]15. Raw Material Supply. The shortage of certain raw materials, bothworld-wide and in the non-dollar area, is likely to be acute. We propose that special^stress be laid upon the expansion of production of raw materials, both inthe O.J&amp;.E.C. countries themselves and in their dependent overseas territories,although we should not encourage facile hopes that Colonial development willyield quick results. [Our own programme probably provides for as rapid expansion as is possible, but this is under continuous examination.]16.   Exports. Very few of the countries have export drives with any realbite in them.   In their programmes they envisage great export expansion, but36556 B 2
this is an arithmetical consequence of the size of their import requirements,and is not backed by any plan. Our proposals envisage the diversion to exportof supplies otherwise destined for the home market, and concentration uponsales to hard currency markets. [Our record entitles us to give them advice;but their competition will increase against us, and to the extent that our adviceis taken, will increase even more.]17. Within this general structure, which is common to our proposals forevery country, major emphasis is placed upon the national effort which is required.There is no escape from this. The French, supported to. some extent by Beneluxand Italy, claim that by some miracle of co-operation the need for unpleasantnational decisions can be avoided. This claim has no substance. It will be arguedin Paris, and the argument may be supported by E.C.A., that integration ofindustry, specialisation, or customs unions will in the long run benefit everyoneand result in a higher standard of living. This will no doubt be discussed at length. It could not in fact be carried out without most unpleasant nationaldecisions. But the essential point is that no action of this kind could possiblybear fruit within the next four years and thus assist towards general european recovery. Our proposals refuse to accept such projects as a substitute for imme-diate action to put right the difficulties in the economies of the various countries.18. The difficulties are formidable, and the eagerness to find a substitute isreadily understandable. Few of the O.E.E.C. countries are administrativelyequipped to carry out the sort of measures which are needed to pull them round.It is not necessary for each country to have the full British apparatus of controls.But if they have no system of direct controls, they need drastic use of fiscal weapons budget surpluses and credit control; and transitional unemployment. It may beas difficult, politically and administratively, for them to do the latter as it wouldbe for them to adopt the full rigour of the British control system.19. Import and exchange control will of course be necessary everywhere,although the administrative implications of this are very difficult for many countries. A drastic internal policy, with a large budget surplus, is likewisenecessary everywhere. Both of these are so important, indeed, that we considerthat they should be kept continuously under review by O.E.E.C. Countries mustalready defend their import plans in O.E.E.C.; they should also be required todefend their internal financial policies eai post facto. The necessity for otherphysical controls, such as food rationing and raw material allocation, will vary from country to country, and we should not seek to lay down general rules. It will depend partly upon the strength of the public&apos;s insistence upon &quot; fair shares &quot; andpartly upon the adequacy of the budgetary policy. But we should emphasise theimportance of the investment programme, insisting that action must be preventednow which would increase the country&apos;s difficulties in four years&apos; time (e.g.,increased allocations of coarse grains, expansion in oil consumption, investment intextiles).20. Exchange rate adjustment is likely to become necessary at some stage;most of the continental currencies are over-valued in terms of the dollar and some countries would probably have to devalue before they could get much further ahead with their export drive. But what is required is adjustment which is preceded by the establishment of reasonable financial stability otherwise the advantages which can be reaped from devaluation are rapidly lost while the disdvantages ofincreasing distrust of the currency remain. At present, when very few of theO.E.E.C. countries enjoy even reasonable financial stability, we consider it too early to move towards general currency stabilisation and at this time it is much better for confidence that the matter should not be discussed at O.E.E.C.21. Taking all these considerations into account, we consider that Norway,Sweden and Denmark can become viable without undue difficulty. Both theNorwegian and Danish industrial investment programmes are too optimistic and require to be curtailed or spread over a larger period. Denmark&apos;s agricultural programme needs some tilting away from dependence upon dollar feeding-stuffs,and she is certain to have a large surplus with the sterling area, which may directly.or indirectly cost us dollars. But in none of these countries is the necessarychange of programme such as would present critical problems.22. France can, in our view, become viable in four years, but only bymastering her internal financial problem.   This is vital, not only because of the
demoralising effect of the inflation upon the whole of her economic and political life, but because her recovery depends primarily upon the growth of agricultural production, both for home consumption and export; it is quite impossible to directthis production unless there are sound price incentives. Industrially, France willhave continuing difficulty in the supply of non-ferrous metals, timber and oil, andsome lowering of the Monnet Plan industrial targets is inevitable. However, the physical problems of the French economy are not insuperable, provided that the inflation is conquered.23. Benelux has most difficult adjustments ahead. If Benelux carries outthe policy of free consumption and imports set out in the Belgium-Holland long-term programme, it will be highly vulnerable as soon as the United Kingdom andother countries can afford to reduce their purchases of Belgian steel and other&apos;&apos; essentials &apos;&apos;; Benelux will not be able to sell fruit and vegetables, textiles and miscellaneous manufactures to other O.E.E.C. countries for dollars. AlreadyBelgium is feeling the strain; there has been a rapid increase in unemployment,which is now equivalent to a United Kingdom rate of over 1,500,000. There areill dlC tit IOI1S that she is ready for a change of policy; indeed,.if Benelux followed the present Belgian policy, the Dutch would be dragged down too. Benelux hasthe task of slimming its textile industry and recasting its agriculture; it mustreimpose import control and secure a budget surplus; if it is to achieve anymodernisation of industry, it will almost certainly nave to reintroduce rationing and other consumption controls. The problem is probably worse for Benelux than for any other O.E.E.C. country-^especially as Belgium has so far been able tomaintain her economy with other O.E.E.C. countries&apos; dollars and has securedworld esteem for her recovery. Indeed, the adjustments required are so serious that Benelux might prefer to run the risks of relying upon its competitive powerto force dollars from other O.E.E.C. countries and the sterling area.24. Italy&apos;s problem is also difficult, and we do not consider that Italy shouldbe pressed to seek to become wholly viable by 1952. Her central problem is over-population, and she is faced by the dilemma that the investment programme needed to absorb her man-power is far more than her economy can afford. She is relying on big expansion of exports of fruit and vegetables and textiles to balance heraccounts, and no markets for these exist. Adjustment of agriculture and loweredsights for industry are the line of modification; as the change is in investment programmes [i.e., the direction: of future effort) this will not be immediatelypainful, but it does carry the implication that Italy must continue to wrestle witha serious problem of surplus man-power.25. The Bizone likewise cannot become viable by 1952 at a reasonable standard of living. But it must move towards viability, and the existing long-term programme is far from it. The important element in the Bizone economy isfood, and here above all it is necessary to make certain of the best use of resources to make sure the humans are fed. The position calls for drastic slowing-down ofthe livestock expansion- which, if allowed to continue, will result in catastrophewhen aid is withdrawn. If the food programme could be got right, and the indus-trial investment programme brought within financial possibilities, the Bizonecould get within a reasonable distance of viability by 1952, and could possiblybecome viable by the middle 1950&apos;s. At present, there are neither the controls northe drastic internal budgetary policy which could serve to keep the agricultural and industrial effort on the right lines.26. We have not examined in detail the prospects of Portugal, Turkey,Greece and A ustria. The two former should become viable without serious difficulty; Greece and Austria have clearly no hope of becoming even nearly viableby 1952, and will need subventions for a further period of years. Switzerlandsubmitted no long-term programme to O.E.E.C. and is of course viable.27. The position of Eire and Iceland should be mentioned here, as O.E.E.C.countries who are part of the sterling area. Eire has no prospect of eliminatingher dollar deficit altogether, for she has virtually no dollar income. The problem is to reduce her deficit to manageable dimensions, and this implies developmentof her agriculture in such a way as will limit her feeding-stuffs imports. this can be done in the last resort only by limiting the amount of dollars released to eire from the sterling ai*ea reserves and by telling Eire that the United kingdom market for agricultural produce is strictly limited. We are considering theappropriate balance of Eire&apos;s agriculture, and our ideas are likely to be extremely
unpalatable to the Irish, who will be very difficult to persuade. The position of iceland depends upon fish and fish products; and particularly upon safes of these to the United Kingdom; the revision of our import programme described belowgoes as far as we can to meet what may be an intractable problem.28. It is clear that the prospects of the O.E.E C. countries vary widely.None of them (except Switzerland) will become viable at all easily. It can beconfidently expected that the Scandinavian countries will solve their problems;it is certain that the Bizone, Italy, Austria and Greece will require further aidafter 1952; the prospects of France and Benelux are wholly uncertain. Whetherone looks at the problem from the point of view of import-saying and export-earning or from the point of view of internal financial reform, its dimensionsare grim.29. There is no doubt that the lines of policy which we recommend are thosewhich O.E.E.C. countries must follow as part of a joint recovery programme.But this is highly unpalatable doctrine to them; their Governments and peoplesare not ready for it; there is no apparent crisis in their affairs which calls forresolute action, nor will there be while Marshall aid continues. Moreover, thereare possibilities open to some of these countries particularly Benelux and theBizone-to seek their salvation independently of the other O.E.E.C. countries,and by framing their whole financial and commercial policy in a manner designedto extract dollars from other O.E.E.C. countries, to pass their share of Europe&apos;sviability problem on to others. This has indeed been the Belgian policy so far,and although its adoption as a long-term policy would involve tremendous risks,it might be less distasteful than the certain adjustments implicit in a jointEuropean programme. It certainly cannot be assumed that everybody will be convinced that in four years&apos; time they cannot seek to earn dollars from everybodyelse. The point of a joint recovery programme is to get the adjustments instructure which will prevent this situation from becoming acute and disruptingthe whole intra-European trade.   But this may not appeal to everybody.30. In conclusion, we believe that, with the exceptions mentioned above, itmay be possible on favourable assumptions (some of which relate to matters not under our control) for Western Europe to become viable by 1952-53. But thedifficulties are great; some of the countries may prefer to pass their problem onto others&apos; backs; and there is serious doubt whether the political and administra-tive conditions will permit the indispensable action to be. taken for a joint recovery programme, even if we succeed in convincing the Governments.II. The Impact upon the United Kingdom31. The difficulties which confront our partners in O.E.E.C. are so great that they will inevitably bring strong pressure to bear upon us to modify burplans in a manner favourable to them, for this could greatly ease their problem.The following are the points at which changes in our programme would be mosthelpful to them, and at which we may expect to be pressed:-(i) Dollars : should we not run a large deficit with Europe as we did beforethe war, and finance it with dollars?(ii) Supply of non-dollar materials : the sterling area is the main source ofnon-dollar supplies, and should not the O.E.E.C. countries have a bigger share?(iii) Exports : should we not help the O.E.E.C. countries to sell their exportsby market-sharing, &amp;c.?(iv) Guaranteed markets: should we not give long-term contracts foressentials to European suppliers, and take the risk off their shoulders?(v) Less essentials : is it not our duty to allow entry from Europe of air the traditional European goods which they care to send ?(vi) Sterling : should we not ensure, by loans or import policy, that theO.E.E.C. countries have all the sterling they need to buy sterling areafood and raw materials ?(vii) Integration : should not the United Kingdom enter into agreements withO.E.E.C. countries to permit an efficient division of labour,co-ordination of investment and freer trade ?32. These are serious questions, which can be argued with great force.Indeed, if we are pressing our partners to carry out extensive and unpalatable
changes in their economies, they can legitimately ask us to make changes too.The fact that our original plan made us viable whereas theirs did not make them,viable is a valid answer, but requires defence against the charge that we aremaking ourselves viable on the Europeans&apos; backs.33. We have examined these points in a constructive spirit, with full regardto the need political, strategic and economic to help Europe as far as possilbe within the limits laid down in E.P.C. (49) 6. But we have found that our ownlong-term position is so precarious and is so vulnerable to the action of othercountries outside our control that we cannot recommend significant concessions in our plans.34. Dollars. The analysis of our dollar viability problem in paragraphs53 to 61 below rules out any possibility of our planning to provide O.E.E.C.countries with dollars. We may have to provide some when the time comes;at the end of the E.R.P. period, we shall be back in a position in which all deficitshave to be settled in the last resort by payments of gold, and some Q.E.E.C.;countries (particularly Switzerland) may succeed in extracting gold from us(especially by exporting to the Dominions). But neither we nor they shouldbudget for this.35. Supply of non-dollar materials. In our own programme, we assume that- the United Kingdom secures for itself the increasing primary productionof the rest of the sterling area. In considering the other countries&apos; programmes,we assume that these supplies are not available to them. This is particularlyrelevant to cotton, wool, and copper, where participating countries&apos; statedrequirements exceed our estimates of available supplies by 25-30 per cent. the exact size of the real problem is not clear, for the participating countries&apos; estimates of material consumption are no doubt inflated, and after examination will bereduced.&quot; But the problem clearly exists. If everyone is switching away from dollar sources of supply, there will be acute competition to get the non-dollarsupplies. It must be borne in mind that the same question has been raised by canada, and by the sterling area countries, particularly India. By our tradeconnections and bulk-buying system we are regarded as pre-empting the availablenon-dollar supplies.36. It is difficult to say how far these charges are valid; in the bulk of cases(e.g., wool) we have no control whatever over the supply, which is distributedby free auction. But where we have no control (i.e., where our supplies arenot assured by long-term contracts or close trade connections) a serious question arises for our own programme, for we are relying on getting those supplies,and others may buy them, bidding up the price as far as necessary. Where wehave effective control over the supplies, we should claim that we should be entitledto take the Colonial supplies ourselves (just as the French and Belgians takefirst cut at their Colonial supplies), treating them for this purpose as home supplies. Whether we have control or hot, we should put main weight on the positive measures in the following paragraph.37. It is proposed that where O.E.E.C. examination shows the likelihood of a shortage or non-dollar supplies, we should advocate positive action to dealwith the situation (i) by organising increased production where possible; (ii) byeconomy of use throughout the O.E.E.C. countries as a matter of long-term policy (including use of substitutes); (iii) by taking this into account in O.E.E.C.examination of investment programmes. We may be asked to arrange jointbuying; this may suit us in some cases, but we do not see how any allocationarrangements could be made between the O.E.E.C. countries alone, and not world-wide.38. Exports. Proposals will no doubt be made for inter-Governmentalaction designed to share export markets (and thus to endanger our export targets).We recommend that these be rejected. We should keep the door open in theColonies for the development of export markets by certain O.E.E.C. countries,and take such steps as we can to encourage the latter to supply the Colonieswith the goods they need. It is possible that the question of Imperial Preferencewill be raised, because of the need for O.E.EU. countries to sell in the sterling area.39. Guaranteed markets. We can accept long-term contracts for primaryproduce from the O.E.E.C. countries and their dependent overseas territories,provided that the price is right and subject to change and provided that the
quantities are in proper relation to the imports we can afford in our long-term programme, having regard to our commitments to take supplies from other sources and especially the Commonwealth.40. Less-essentials. This question generates considerable heat in O.E.E.C. indeed, more heat than it intrinsically merits. The term &quot; less-essentials &quot; hasnot been defined and has been understood differently in different contexts. Itshould be defined, not absolutely, but as &apos;&apos; goods to which, in the light of theneed to achieve viability in 1952-53, participating countries attach a low priority in determining their imports and of which producing countries are likely, there-fore, to have a larger amount available for export than importing countries willdesire to purchase.&quot; Different commodities will be concerned in different countries.In the case of the United Kingdom, &quot;less-essentials&quot; may vary from luxuriestraditionally supplied by the Continent to certain staple commodities above the levels which we can import in the light of the need for viability. We must in anycase modify to some extent the proportion of essentials and less-essentials in our import programme (see paragraphs 74-82 below); the programme as we submittedit originally was indefensible on commercial grounds, for it provided for othercountries buying our less essentials, while we were not buying enough of theirs.41. It is proposed that we seek to establish agreement in O.E.E.C. on thefollowing lines, which spell out further the discussion on the Interim Report: (a) Every participating country which produces &quot;less-essentials&quot; should attempt to develop export markets for these goods outside the participating countries.(b) To the extent that &quot; less-essentials &quot; cannot be absorbed on the home orexport markets, participating countries should attempt to discourageproduction of those goods; in particular, they should not press suchexports on participating countries or facilitate new investment in their production.(c) The E.R.P. period is one of transition in which countries should endeavourto change from the production of &quot; less-essentials &quot; to &quot; essentials.&quot;To make the necessary change of structure easier and to avoid violentshocks, participating countries should adopt a less stringent attitudetowards &quot; less-essentials &quot; than would be justified by a given level of exports. (This aspect is allowed for in the Trade Rules.) They arein a better position to do this while they are receiving help in dollarsby which their overall balance of payments is assisted.(d) Even after the years of E.R.P., when each country will have to maintain its overall balance without extraordinary outside assistance, there isroom for give and take, and each country may be expected to make some contribution in the general cause. In some cases, for instance,the process of adaptation may be slow and the problems of an abruptchange great, while in others it has been argued that the background of a stable European trade may be necessary as a basis for competitiveexports of the same goods to other countries. In such cases, the importing country, even after the end of the period of E.R.P., shouldadmit some &quot;less-essentials&quot; from the other participating countries.But it must be recognised that this may mean a lowering of the importing country&apos;s overall standards (judged by the only possiblecriterion the importing country&apos;s preference) on the assumption thatoverall balance must be maintained; therefore imports such as thecountries cannot really afford must be kept within reasonable limits.(e) There may be cases where an exchange of &quot;less-essentials&quot; may benefitboth exchanging countries as an addition to the trade which would otherwise take place.This line of policy would imply the maintenance of a measure of detailed import control on Intra-European trade. Whilst import control, especially on dollar imports, is a necessary part of the administrative apparatus of recovery, as setout in paragraph 19 above, the difficulties it involves, even for countries withrelatively efficient machinery, are a strong argument for the progressive relaxation-tion of quantitative restrictions on Intra-European trade to the extent the balanceof payments position of individual countries permits.42. Sterling. Some O.E.E.C. countries (especially France) see themselveschronically short of sterling; others (e.g., Denmark) will certainly be heavily in
surplus in sterling, and will wish to convert into dollars. The position of thevarious O.E.E.C. countries differs very widely, as of course it should, for thereis no need for bilateral balance. There is a general desire to build up sterlingearnings, especially by sales to the United Kingdom, and the more sterling areamaterials there are available, the more pressure there will be on us to providesterling somehow to the countries in sterling deficit. It is clearly necessary thata pattern of trade should develop by which countries in sterling deficit earnsterling from countries in sterling surplus (either European or Middle East).This will be resisted, possibly both by the deficit countries and by the surpluscountries the former wanting to be given sterling by us, and the latter wantingto convert into dollars. No ready solution can be found at this stage; but clearlycommitments to provide sterling for deficit countries must be avoided. In orderto forestall criticism, it is proposed that we in future show the sterling area as awhole in small deficit with the O.E.E.C. countries as a whole, indicating thatthere is no intention of making sterling &quot;scarce,&quot; and that there will be apossibility of using sterling for purchases elsewhere. It is proposed that weshould also indicate willingness to permit some investment in the deficit countries;43. Integration. Such suggestions as have been made for the so-called&quot; integration &quot;of the economies of the O.E;E.C. countries fall into four types (a) co-ordination of new investment;(6) specialisation of production (i.e., &quot; planned &quot; arrangements by which one country specialises in one line of production and others in others);(c) removal of trade barriers;(d) agricultural integration.This is a series of questions to which great importance is attached by some other.E.E.C. countries, and by E.C.A. None of them has been at all clearly worked out by its advocates, and considerable discussion will be necessary before anythingpractical emerges. We shall have to be ready to consider any reasonable proposal,and must expect to be under continuous pressure, though rarely on concretepropositions.44. On (a), there is a strong case for action where the unit of capital invest-ment is large, e.g., steel, oil refineries, fertiliser plants. Serious waste can takeplace if these facilities are duplicated. Indeed, with this in mind, E.C.A. isinsisting upon &quot; an agreed plan &quot; for steel development and oil refineries beforeaccepting requirements of plant for E.C.A. financing. How such a plan can bemade is far from clear, for the issues involved extend far beyond the industry concerned, and affect the countries&apos; balance of payments and security. In theserelatively few industries, however, where the unit of investment is large and it isthought that there is a danger of over-expansion and waste of resources, it ishoped that it will be possible to bring the supply of new plant into line with thedemand by persuading countries with projects of doubtful wisdom to postponethem all their investment programmes are too large anyway. If this techniqueis applied, it is hoped that our projects will not suffer, but clearly there is some risk.45. Even in the limited field of industries with a large unit of investmentit is by no means clear that practical action can be taken&apos;to co-ordinate invest-ment. It is impossible to determine effective criteria; those industries raise questions of strategy, politics and prestige, and are not governed by purelyeconomic considerations; there is no uniform system of control of investment inthe various O.E.E.C. countries; any work which is done is bound to be experi-mental in character, and may in the end lead only to formation of cartels.However, E.C.A. regards this as a necessary condition for the approval of theuse of E.C.A. funds (and possibly for the issue of export licences) for steelworksand oil refinery plant; the danger of waste from duplication is considerable;we do not think the United Kingdom has much to lose; and we consider that inthis field the attempt should be made. We propose, however, that no attempt should be made to co-ordinate new industrial investment except jn such casesas described above. Where the unit of investment is small, Governments cannoteffectively control it in any event, and it is clearly hopeless (even if desirable)to seek international co-ordination.46.   On the other hand, the examination of individual countries&apos; investment programmes in relation to their plans for securing viability and their internal36556 c
financial stability can probably yield useful results in that this examination byO.E.E.C. would increase the pressure upon Governments to bring their invest-ment plans into line with realistic possibilities of achievement, and it is proposedthat we should attach most weight to this type of &quot; co-ordination of new invest-ment.&quot;47. On (6), no precise proposals have been made, although the French havetalked about the possibility of France making all the motor cars of one size, Italyall of another, United Kingdom all of another. It is difficult to see how any proposals of this kind could be put into effect without cartel agreements, enforcedby Governments. These would hardly be likely to lead to greater efficiency and reduction in export costs. From our own point of view, such proposals containlittle attraction. If definite proposals are submitted, we should of course beprepared to examine them. But we recommend that our Delegation should takethe line that, in so far as such proposals envisaged the limitations of competition,by cartels or otherwise, in such a way that less efficient producers would be protected, His Majesty&apos;s Government would regard them as disadvantageous.This answer would, we presume, be acceptable to E.C.A.48. On (c), a general relaxation of quantitative restrictions is in many waysthe most promising approach to &quot; integration,&quot; but anything like a completeremoval of quantitative restrictions between the O.E.E.C. countries assumes thatall the O.E.E.C. countries are equal from a currency standpoint; although we canadopt a very liberal policy towards imports from France, we clearly cannotcontemplate increased imports from Belgium or Switzerland. While quantitative restrictions remain, tariffs are of secondary importance, and we should maintain that the tariff reductions already made or impending represent as much as canbe attempted for the time being.49. On (d), agriculture presents special problems, and it is known thatE.C.A. attaches great importance to a common agricultural plan for the O.E.E.C.countries, although it is unlikely that their idea of the proper objectives for european agriculture would correspond with the dollar-saving line in para-graph 11 above. Our proposals do provide for a modification of agricultural policyin the same direction in all O.E.E.C. countries, and.in effect represent a very far-reaching co-ordination of agricultural investment policy. [The particular case of horticulture may present us with some difficulty.]50. As we stated earlier, it is difficult to see how proposals for &quot; integra-tion &quot; can have much practical value to help European recovery; they may be advantageous in the long run, but they are hardly relevant to the immediate problem of European viability.51. Of the matters listed in this section, (i), (ii) and (vi) appear to bethe most important in reality to the other O.E.E.C. countries--and naturallyenough the points at which we can least readily make concessions. But we shallencounter continuous pressure on &quot;integration.&quot;&apos;III. Revision of United Kingdom Long-Term Programme52. With these considerations in view, and in the light of all the happeningssince last September, we have thoroughly reviewed the United Kingdom long-term programme (Cmd. 7572). Our new assessment of the situation is somewhat less favourable than that of six months ago; we have found that our prospects of achieving the consumption levels and industrial activity laid down in our long-term programme are less promising than they appeared to be. It will bevery difficult to work up to the food consumption levels envisaged in our original long-term programme; the raw material supply is much less assuredthan it seemed safe to count upon six months ago. On the balance of paymentsside, in particular, although the figures are artificial, they point to real con-clusions; if the actual action which is taken now does not corresoond to thisrevised view of our situation, we feel that risks are being run and that we shallbe faced with continuous disappointments in our struggle for viability. Thisapparent worsening of our prospects has a definite implication for our policy on the points at issue in European co-operation as described in Section II above.Our own viability is not so firmly based that we can afford to run risks with it.
53. Dollars.-The new estimates show that the achievement of dollarviability will be more difficult than was originally thought. These additionaldifficulties arise not from changes in the quantities of imports required or of export expectations, but from a more refined analysis of the geographical distri-bution of our trade. This shows that we were previously implicity countingupon earning dollars (e.g., from Brazil) where this is clearly impossible.54. According to the revised estimates, the United Kingdom deficit with the dollar area is put at $311 million. It is noteworthy that we are shown as in deficitwith Canada to about $250 million, and in surplus with the United States itself.Canada emerges as the critical problem.55. It must be emphasised that this deficit with the dollar area of over%300 million contains optimistic assumptions : (i) Full success of our policy of import diversion, i.e., that we are able tocarry out our policy of switching imports to non-dollar sourceswithout interference from other countries which are trying to dothe same; in wool and copper, for example, if we were required to sharesterling area supplies with other O.E.E.C. countries, we might be unable to procure the supplies at all, and if we could, we might be faced by additional dollar expenditure of well over $100 million.In general the rate of progress in the development of new sources ofsupply is disappointing, and if upon this is superimposed greatercompetition for sterling supplies, our plans can be badly set back.This is the crucial implication of the policy issue described inparagraphs 35 to 37 above.(ii) That we can succeed commercially in conducting an export driverequiring the maximum of goodwill and co-operation from theCanadian and United States Governments, while buying very little of the goods which they want to sell to us. On the lay-out proposed,we should be in surplus with United States itself, limiting our purchases to cotton, tobacco, machinery and various raw materials; weshould be buying literally no food and hardly any manufactures. Weshould certainly be under continuous commercial pressure from theUnited States, which is not a good atmosphere for out export drive. OurCanadian programme consists largely of wheat, non-ferrous metalsand timber, with some bacon and cheese; the purchases of wheat,bacon and timber would be less than in recent years, and our policy would be incompatible with the Canadians&apos; objective of a mixedagricultural policy. The Canadians are eager to help us to build up our export drive (and also want to draw supplies from the rest of theCommonwealth). But the long-term pattern of imports from Canadawhich we contemplate is not commercially attractive to Canada, andwe are about at the limit of diversion from Canada which iscompatible with good political and trading relations with them.(iii) That we shall be able to sell $368 millions&apos; worth of crude oil and petroleum products to United States companies the full achievement of this must be regarded as doubtful in a general context of worlddollar shortage preventing other countries from absorbing UnitedStates companies&apos; own supplies.   See paragraphs 64 to 68 below.(iv) That we can increase exports to North America by about 25 per cent.above their 1949 level, and more than double our income from UnitedStates tourists. We regard the latter estimate in any case as too high, especially if we are not prepared to take special steps in suchmatters as petrol and food to attract American and Canadian tourists.56. In addition to the $311 million deficit with the dollar area, we shallhave to pay gold or dollars elsewhere, especially, e.g., to Persia and Curacao, whichmay take as much as $100 million as our oil production expands; nor can we see how we shall avoid paying some gold to Switzerland. It would be most unwise to put our net dollar expenditure at less than $450 million, and this makes no allowance for payments of gold or dollars to O.E.E.C. countries suchas Benelux and Denmark; we should not budget for this, but we may not beable to avoid it consistently with the consumption level envisaged for 1952-53,even if we press our exports hard to these countries, as we must (see paragraph34 above).
57. We are thus implicitly relying upon being able to finance dollar expenditure of $450 million from the gold production and net dollar earnings ofthe rest of the sterling area. We have made a more detailed examination than was possible last September, and consider that this is possible, but highly pre-carious. The gold production of the rest of the sterling area is estimated at about $450 millions, but the net dollar earnings of the Colonies are expected to fall short of the dollar deficit of the independent sterling area countries. Tocover the United Kingdom net dollar expenditure of $450 million in this way,the following things would have to happen : (i) South Africa, now facing acute crisis with imponderable consequences,would have to arrange her affairs so that she reduced her dollar deficitfrom the present rate of f675 million a year to $200 million, and continued to sell her gold to us.(ii) Eire, whose long-term programme envisages a dollar deficit of $55million, would have to. limit herself to about $20 million; this involvesserious modification of her agricultural plans.(iii) India and Pakistan, now running a dollar deficit of nearly $200 million a year (half financed by the International Monetary Fund), would haveto reduce this to about $80 millions (plus what they could borrow fromthe United States).(iv) The Colonies would have to continue to increase their earnings of dollarswithout increasing their imports from the United States and Canada.These are all very difficult things for these countries to do, in some cases with serious political implications. They can happen, but it would be imprudent to rely upon them all happening at once. Moreover, it would be very difficult to achieve (iv) and to persuade Australia and New Zealand to economise in dollars ifthe rest of the sterling area were not fully playing its part; the Colonies, Australiaand New Zealand are prepared to inconvenience themselves as part of a combinedeffort with the United Kingdom and the sterling area as a whole, but not tosupport South Africa, India and Eire.58. The conclusion which we draw is that on our revised programme our dollar viability is by no means assured. We need another $100 million a year in hand before we are justified in saying that we are planning viability. this seems to us inescapable. It is proposed that we cut the import programme by$50 million, and raise the export sights by $50 million, as follows : (i) An increase of $50 million in exports to the dollar area from $922 million to $972 million, compared with $712 million in 1948.(ii) A reduction of $50 million in imports could be achieved by (a) not increasing the coarse grains import figure submitted toO.E.E.C., although it is now calculated by the Ministry ofAgriculture to be 270,000 tons less than required for the agri-cultural programme ($18 million) see paragraph 62 below;(6) a cut of 5 per cent, in raw material imports from the dollar area(1 per cent, on all raw material imports), which would fallmainly on cotton, timber and non-ferrous metals ($32 millions).59. The fundamental point about dollar imports is that our long-term programme already provides for very effective (and optimistic) diversion of imports to non-dollar sources of supply; there is very little left at which to cut.The only food which we expect to draw from the dollar area in 1952-53 isCanadian wheat, bacon and cheese. On this revision of the programme, we have reduced supplies of wheat from Canada from 130 million to 100 million bushels,compared with 140 million bushels in the current year&apos;s contract, and we cannotplan on taking less than this; the Canadians were warned at a recent meeting ofthe United Kingdom-Canada Continuing Committee that we should probablyneed to reduce the figure of 130 million bushels implied in the original programmeput in to O.E.E.C., and they expressed concern at this; further discussion withthem will be necessary in due course and this will require careful treatment atO.E.E.C. The quantities of bacon and cheese from Canada in our long-term programme are small, and exclusion of these would certainly be incompatible with our plans to build up exports to Canada on a huge scale.60. We are, therefore, forced towards raw material cuts which manifestlycreate difficulty. We do not think it necessary to allocate a theoretical cut betweenthe raw materials, nor can we compute the implications, except to say that the
burden would be bound to fall unevenly, and might involve critical shortages ofparticular qualities of materials. What we are saying is that the raw materialsupply is not assured; if we fall even a little way short of success in our plans for1952-53, the raw material shortage can rapidly become critical and inevitablycreate unemployment or a fall in the standard of living.61. In Table IV of Appendix II, where the balance of payments position isset out in detail, we have taken account of the proposed treatment of coarse grains,but not the other adjustments proposed in paragraph 58. This is to secure a balance of payments table which would be used at O.E.E.C.62. Agriculture. It is proposed (the Ministry of Agriculture representa-tive dissenting) to retain the programmed import of coarse grains tabled atO.E.E.C. in September, although the Ministry of Agriculture do not now think this is enough to permit the egg and bacon targets in the agricultural programme to be achieved. This is because the Ministry are no longer confident that they can rely upon the full implementation of the home production plan for fodder crops.The Ministry emphasise the importance, from the point of view of gettingagricultural output, of satisfying the farmers that they are being fairly treated,both in comparison with other industries and in comparison with other countries;the Ministry feel that this proposal is unwise from this standpoint. However,apart altogether from the dollar considerations, it would be extremely difficult for us to go to O.E.E.C. proposing slashing cuts on European livestock pro-grammes and at the same time with an increase in our own coarse grains imports.It is not thought necessary at this stage to make any public revision of the eggand bacon targets.63. Co.al. The question of our long-term production target is raised bythe fact that other O.E.E.C. countries are expecting to take 9 million tons lessUnited Kingdom coal than we were expecting to send them. It is possible toincrease our prospective exports to other countries by 2 million tons, but unlessthe O.E.E.C. countries themselves increase their estimates of their prospectiveimports from us, there is a p?&apos;ima facie case for reducing our production targetby 7 million tons. It is proposed that the matter be examined further after thenext round in Paris, but that the O.E.E.C. countries should not be pressed toincrease their requirements from us. Even if the production target were reduced,it would not affect the coal investment programme, which is designed to increase efficiency.64. Oil. An examination of the long-term programmes of the participating countries suggests two factors which might lead to a revision of the UnitedKingdom oil programme.   These are :-(i) It is proposed as one of the measures for securing European dollarviability that the dollar oil imports of the European countries shouldbe restricted to a level some $200 million (or about 8 million tons)below the level contemplated for 1952-53. Assuming the validity ofthe estimates of world demand on which the oil programme was based,this reduction in the outlets for dollar oil would probably make it more difficult for British companies to sell oil in dollar markets.This raises the question whether the oil programme will make the contribution to closing the dollar gap estimated in the long-term pro-gramme as it now stands,(ii) The participating countries&apos; programmes show 1^ million tons more of sterling crude oil imports and 3 million tons less of sterling refined products imports than the United Kingdom had programmed to export. It is considered that, although some of these estimates maybe revised after the refinery construction programmes have been further examined in the O.E.E.C., they should, at this stage, beaccepted.65. The proposal to restrict the O.E.E.C. countries&apos; imports of dollar oilwill raise considerable difficulties, for it means reducing the business of theUnited States oil companies&apos; subsidiaries in Europe a very unpalatable adjust-ment for them to make, and one which may result in heavy pressure from E.C.A.This is perhaps the chief case, indeed, in which the achievement of Europeanviability runs directly counter to United States commercial interests. From our point of view, the complexity of this problem is increased by the fact that in effectBritish and American companies are the only suppliers of the world market.
66. We shall probably be pressed to undertake to supply more sterling oil,and so permit the O.E.E.C. countries to continue to expand oil consumption iaspite of lower imports of dollar oil. We shall be unable to make commitments to do this, although we may be able in the event to supply some extra crude oiland fuel oil.67. These factors in themselves create a prima facie case for a reconsider a-tion of the oil production and investment programme. But they cannot beregarded as firmly established until there has been further discussion in Paris.Moreover, the United Kingdom oil programme depends on the world oil situation,and it has not yet been possible to assess the world-wide repercussions of thereduction in European demand for oil.   This is being examined.68. It is therefore proposed that our Delegation at O.E.E.C. should acceptthe O.E.E.C. countries&apos; estimates of their demands for sterling oil (if these are maintained after discussion); if the O.E.E.C. countries seek to increase theirtakings of sterling oil to compensate for reduced imports of dollar oil, our Deie-gation should indicate our willingness to consider this, but should not hold outprospects of higher supplies, except for crude oil and fuel oil.69. Steel. The general position revealed in the O.E.E.C. Interim report is that the O.E.E.C. countries&apos; steel production in 1952-53 is likely to exceeddemand, at home and for export, by about 1\ million tons; there is thus a generalcase for spreading the steel development programmes over a rather longer period than that now envisaged. It does not appear necessary that this spreading pro-cess should apply to the United Kingdom programme, either for finishing capacityor for crude capacity. The type of finishing plant in question is not economicunless operated on a large scale; if adjustment is necessary, it should be made onthe smaller and less economic plants. Some of the Continental schemes are infact already being modified. The expansion of United Kingdom crude capacity is necessitated by our inability to obtain a regular flow of crude and semi-finished steel from abroad.70. As explained in paragraph 39 above, E.C.A. is insisting upon the pre-paration of an &quot;integrated&quot; steel programme; the United Kingdom still hasa few orders to place in the United States and may have to argue in O.E.E.C.the case for these. Failure to secure approval would involve some modification inthe direction of the expansion programme but no major change in its scale. Itwould be unwise to put forward any general upward revision of the UnitedKingdom programme at this moment.71. Textiles. It is not considered necessary significantly to modify theUnited Kingdom production and export plans for textiles in face of the potentialover-production revealed in the O.E.E.C. Interim Report. Our 1952-53 exportestimates of rayon and wool manufactures are lower than our present exports,and our cotton estimate, though above the present level, is still below pre-war.The output of textiles for clothing the civil population is assumed to be ratherbelow pre-war; the total production target is modest.72. We are unlikely to be pressed to alter our figures for the cotton industry,since both output and exports are lower than in 1938; a small reduction may bemade in the estimates for wool manufactures. Both in the cotton and wool textile industries, the current level of investment in new capital is relatively small andis mainly designed to improve efficiency, not to expand capacity. In the rayonindustry, however, a total investment of about  20 million in new factories is dueto take place over the next four or five years and this will raise capacity from about 120,000 tons per annum to 200,000 tons per annum. This expansion isjustifiable on the grounds that it will improve the supply of industrial fibres(e.g., tyre yarns in substitution for imports from the United States); and that itwill also reduce the need to import raw cotton for dollars. The estimates of exports on which the British rayon expansion programme is based are below whatthe rayon manufacturers themselves are disposed to predict; a large part of the exports will consist of specialities, such as spun yarn and dyed ciscose staple, inwhich British industry has a clear advantage over its Continental competitors.73. Raw Material Supply. Apart from the possible raw material shortageswhich may result from our lack of dollar-earning power, as explained in para-graph 60 above, it must be emphasised that our industrial programme generallyis highly vulnerable to failures of raw material supply.   We are assuming
throughout that we are able to procure the supplies that we need, although itseems very likely that there will be intensive competition for non-dollar supplies,especially if United States business activity continues at its present high level,and the United States Government wishes to press its stockpiling policy. the potential shortage applies particularly to non-ferrous metals, but supplies ofnon-dollar cotton, wool and jute are also in question. It is difficult to plan on araw material shortage, but the dangers which arise from this potential shortagemust be stressed.74. The Import Programme.-A thorough review of the import programme(non-dollar as well as dollar) reveals a disturbing position. Our 1948-49 import programme contains too much less-essentials and not enough essentials (not enough are available). In framing our original 1952-53 programme, we providedheavily for essentials; on consideration, we found this programme, as revised totake into account new availabilities, to be untenable commercially, in that wecould not hope to sell our less-essentials (necessary to achieve our own exportestimates) unless we were willing to take more of other people&apos;s less-essentials.This applies particularly to the other participants, but also to commonwealth countries.75. The full statistical picture is set out in Appendix II. The total balanceof payments, not taking account of the dollar cuts (except coarse grains) suggestedin paragraph 58 above, may be summarised as follows :-1952-53$m.Imports Food and feeding-stuffs     ... 3,326Animals, seeds, &amp;c.         ... 135Tobacco       ......... 184Raw materials        ...... 3,369Machinery and vehicles     ... 118Manufactured goods         ... 422Petroleum     ......... 5108,0631952-53$m.Exports and re-exports       ...      ...       7,376Net invisibles  ...      ...      ...      ...       1,0878,463Surplus ...      ...      ...      ... 4008,06376. This table contains provision for the raw materials needed for theindustrial programme; petroleum including a basic ration; machinery from theO.E.E.C. countries on the assumption of free import licences; manufacturedgoods from the O.E.E.C. countries at $245 million, which is 80-85 per cent, of pre-war volume (except from Germany), which is probably reasonably in line with what they expect to send to us, although it cannot be said to provide for a sub-stantial freeing of trade it is only about 10 per cent, above the current level.77. The critical problem is the distribution of the food programme so thatit provides the best possible ration levels while taking enough less-essentials tobe commercially tenable as a working basis. The original long-term programme(Cmd. 7572) failed to satisfy the latter test on analysis; it provided the followingration level: Fats    ...... 101 oz.Sugar  ...... 8 oz.Meat   ...... Is. 2\d. plus Id. canned for 16 weeks.    . .   .Bacon ...... 4 oz.Cheese....... 2 oz.Eggs in shell ... 120Tea     ...      ... 2\ oz.78. It is possible within the same financial limits to produce a programme which would be more justifiable to O.E.E.C. and more tenable commercially, andnot inferior from a food point of view : Fats...... 101 oz- (now 9 oz-)Sugar        ... 10 oz. (as now)Meat        ... is. 2\d. plus 2d. canned for 13 weeks (maximum available; now Is.including canned)Bacon       ...       4 oz. (now 2 oz.)Cheese      ...       2 oz. (now \\ oz.)Eggs in shell 130 (how about 100)Tea......       2\ oz. (now 2 oz.)This cannot be regarded as a satisfactory programme from the point of view ofthe balance between essential and less essential items, and the Ministry of Food
representative reserves his position on it. This programme in detail for 1952-53is of considerable practical significance. The marginal butter, bacon, eggs andprocessed milk come from the O.E.E.C. countries; they may press us to give themlong-term contracts, and they will certainly ask for a sign of our intentions. Thefigures here are appreciably less than they hope to sell to us. But this consump-tion level is the maximum we shall be able to afford (consistent with our rawmaterial supplies) if exports do not exceed 150 per cent, of 1938 volume.79. It may be added that in the programme outlined above our imports of fruit and vegetables from all sources would be about three-quarters of the present level and about two-thirds of present imports from O.E.E.C. countries. Never-theless, they would be about five times the pre-war value from the participants.We should be taking only one-half of the present imports of wines and spirits(but these are not now selling at all easily). We should be importing fish at about half the present level but nearly four times the pre-war value from the participants. Home production of fish of course would be substantially greater.This programme treats the O.E.E.C. countries better than anything we havehitherto promised but it is bound to disappoint them. It will be unwelcome tosome because we shall be taking fewer less-essentials than we are taking now, andit will be unwelcome to others because we shall not be taking as much essentialsas they would like to supply. But if in order to reach an overall surplus withoutoutside assistance we cannot afford more for food, our import programme fromthe participants is bound to be displeasing to them.80. With a food import programme some 5 per cent, larger it would bepossible to provide the rations in paragraph 78 above (with 2^ oz. tea, and 140 eggs and more bacon) and not far short of current supplies of fruit and vegetables,wines and spirits and miscellaneous foods. If we worked on the basis of sucha programme, this would involve a consequential increase in our export estimateby f 165 million, or to 153 per cent, of 1938. From a formal point of view, itis clearly legitimate to increase our export estimate in order to balance trade at a higher level. Indeed, a lay-out showing expanded trade in both directionswould be acceptable to the O.E.E.C. On the other hand, it must be emphasised that the 150 per cent, export forecast has been regarded as a reasonable maximum,to be achieved year in and year out. It is doubtful whether we could in factrely upon higher exports than 150 per cent, of 1938, which itself involves a continuous improvement in the competitive power of British exports, particularlynow that the massive export plans of the Bizone are revealed. It would, there-fore, be improvident to make commitments on import policy which depended upon a higher export figure.81. It is proposed that we plan on the basis of the programme outlined inparagraph 78 above, related to exports at 150 per cent, of pre-war volume.It is proposed that in addition to this we use a programme based on higher food imports and exports as in paragraph 80 above, explaining to O.E.E.C. that we are willing to consider this on the basis of bigger trade both ways; we should makeit clear to them, however, that much as we would like it we cannot commit ourselves to a programme which implies a level of exports which we cannot feel sure of achieving.82. There is no doubt from the preceding paragraphs that we shall have considerable difficulty in attaining the food consumption levels implied in theoriginal long-term programme. There is inevitable uncertainty about our ownagricultural programme; there is hardly any freedom of manoeuvre in the import programme, and we shall have little scope for flexible treatment of our suppliers.Prices of some foods may fall as they become more plentiful, but the extent towhich this will ease our situation will depend upon the fall in the prices of our exports.  The outlook for consumption levels must be regarded with great caution.83. The Revised Programme and O.E.E.C. Even the lower revised import programme above would be a marked improvement from the O.E.E.C. countries&apos;point of view; we shall be taking some $80 million more of imports from them(making $1,825 million) compared with the programme submitted to O.E.E.C.on 1st October. Of the further $168 million in the additional food programme,nearly f 100 million would come from O.E.E.C. countries.84. It is proposed that our revised long-term programme as a whole shouldnot be submitted to O.E.E.C. at this stage, but that our Delegation to O.E.E.C.should be guided by it in the discussions of programme adjustment which will
take place in O.E.E.C. during the next few months. It is proposed also thatsuch action as is taken by Departments in the next few months which directlyaffects our long-term position should be in general accordance with this revisedlong-term programme.IY. The Impact upon the Commonwealth85. The series of problems raised in sections I to III of this paper hasweighty, impact upon the Commonwealth. As part of the normal work of informing other members of the Commonwealth of the course of events, we should,of course, let them know through the ordinary channels of the general lines onwhich the United Kingdom delegation will be authorised to discuss matters atO.E.E.C. and we should also communicate to them copies of any documents sub-mitted to O.E.E.C. In addition there will be a number of special points affectingparticular Commonwealth countries on which it will be necessary to consult them.But in addition to this, policy questions of considerable importance to the Com-commonwealth and ourselves fall to be decided. A detailed memorandum is being prepared for submission to Ministers on these policy questions, and no decisions are sought at this stage. But in order to bring these questions into perspectivewith the decisions to be taken on this paper, the nature of the problems raised is described below.86. Canada. The revision of our own programme is in a direction less favourable to Canada than the programme explained to the Canadian government by the Chancellor last September. In particular, as stated in paragraph 59 above,we are now expecting to take less Canadian wheat and more Australian wheat than we had previously estimated. In relation to our own and the other commonwealth countries&apos; import needs, and indeed to Canada&apos;s exports, these are marginal adjust-ments. But it is, nevertheless, necessary to explain the change to the canadian government, for it would be disastrous for this to come to the Canadian Govern-ment&apos;s notice for the first time via O.E.E.C. The essential point is that ourrevised long-term programme is less acceptable to Canada than our original programme.87. Sterling Area Dollar Deficit. In the course of programme revision, wehave examined the long-term balance of payments prospects of the Colonies and sterling Members of the Commonwealth, and have come to the conclusion thatthe dollar deficit of the latter is likely to be larger than had previously been hoped, and that the assumptions which we are making in assessing our viability(paragraph 57) are highly optimistic unless these countries (particularly Indiaand Pakistan, South Africa and Eire) take vigorous and painful action. Howremedied is a very difficult question; any approach to the Common-wealth Governments will require careful thought.88. Drain on United Kingdom Resources. Besides the dollar deficit of the sterling Commonwealth, there &quot;is also the question of many of these countries&apos;general balance of payments deficits, which of course represents a drain upon our resources. We have always counted on the Colonies having a long-term deficitrelated to the development programme, but our estimates suggest that SouthAfrica and India, in particular, will be running large deficits, and their existing policies probably rely upon a greater direct or indirect assistance from us than weshall be able to afford.89. Sterling Area and O.E.E.C. As the amount of E.R.P. aid diminishes,there will be increasing pressure upon supplies from non-dollar countries. Wemay be pressed by the O.E.E.C. countries to arrange for them to receive a larger share of supplies from the sterling area; we shall certainly be pressed by them to seek to organise increased primary production in the sterling area; questions ofO.E.E.C. countries&apos; markets in the sterling area will arise. These are all matters which O.E.E.C. may wish to discuss with the countries of the Commonwealth,and in any event it will probably be desirable for us to concert a common lineof policy with the sterling Commonwealth countries.90. A memorandum will be submitted to Ministers, but we thought itnecessary to make these points now so that they can be borne in mind when our capacity to incur obligations is being considered.
Y. Proposals for Action at O.E.E.C.91. To sum up, the situation as we see it is governed by two majorconsiderations:  (i) The prospects of the United Kingdom in four years&apos; time, when marshall aid comes to an end, are less secure than had previously been thought.It can still reasonably be hoped that we shall be able to afford a con-siderably higher food consumption than that now ruling, and sustainour industry as well, but the margins are very narrow, and if any ofour main plans go seriously awry, the consequences can be grave. Animportant source of uncertainty, which can disrupt our entire position,is the development of certain Commonwealth countries (particularlySouth Africa and India) into chronic debtors. The conclusion is thatour external earning power is already fully committed (if not overcommitted) and we cannot afford to change our plans in a manner which would give long-term assistance to the O.E.E.C. countries.(ii) The problems confronting Western Europe are capable of solution, but toget within reach of sblving them in four years requires national efforts of an unprecedented character, involving acute political and adminis-trative difficulties. The courses of action which we recommend, though a logical and inevitable development of the agreed O.E.E.C. InterimEeport, will be extremely unpalatable to nearly all our O.E.E.C.partners, and this distaste will be accentuated by the fact that we areunable significantly to modify our own programme in a manner helpful to them.92. This situation can lead to highly delicate and explosive negotiations inO.E.E.C. It is complicated by the fact that there is little common economic interest binding the O.E.E.C. countries together indeed, their interests divergein many important respects. Some are potentially viable by their own efforts andothers have some prospect of finding their own salvation at our and others&apos; expense.The attitude of E.C.A., when real problems come to be discussed in O.E.E.C., isunpredictable, and certainly cannot be relied upon in our support. Mr. Hoffman&apos;sstatement to Congress suggests that he may now be thinking on similar lines to ourselves, but this cannot be taken as sure evidence of E.C.A. support.93. A further difficulty in developing action is that there is now no obviouseconomic crisis in Europe. With Marshall aid, countries are getting along reason-ably smoothly in many cases pursuing policies which will make&quot; their situationmore difficult rather than less as the amount of aid falls. It is still uncertain whether the amount of aid voted by Congress will be big enough to permit thissmooth &quot; progress &quot;to continue. If it is not enough, a crisis is bound to comenext November, when O.E.E.C. prepares its bid for the 1950-51 appropriation.If no action is taken on the lines of section I above, the bid for aid for 1950-51will probably be higher than the bid for 1949-50, just as the bid for 1949-50(except for the United Kingdom) was higher than the aid received in 1948-49.The Americans would then nave to decide between cutting the aid drastically andvirtually perpetuating aid.94. It has been suggested by M. Spaak and others that the United kingdom should table a joint recovery programme at O.E.E.C. This opportunity has theadvantage of giving us the initiative and of enabling us to steer the work ofO.E.E.C. in a practical manner in the right direction. But it also embarrassesus, for any proposals that we make will be unpopular with our Continentalpartners.95. Nevertheless, it is recommended that we do submit a joint recovery pro-gramme at the earliest opportunity. The presentation is of first-class importance,and before firm decisions are reached it is suggested that the considered views ofour O.E.E.C. delegation should be obtained. What follows is, we believe, ingeneral accordance with the delegation^ views.96. Our proposals should be presented as a course of action for the european countries as a whole, translating into concrete policy terms the general principles laid down in the O.E.E.C. Interim Report. They should not be a &quot; blueprint&quot;telling each country what to do.   They should concentrate on the points set out in
section. I (and, where appropriate, section II) of this paper. The central featuresshould be : (i) the importance of internal financial policy, with the definite proposal that O.E.E.C. should consider each country&apos;s internal policy (after theevent, of course; obviously countries cannot discuss future budgetarypolicy);(ii) the importance of import control and dollar-saving; countries&apos; policiesare already under examination at O.E.E.C.;(iii) countries should not plan to earn dollars from each other;(iv) food and agriculture; slowing-down livestock expansion, dependingupon coarse grains; increasing basic food production for humans;(v) energy; checking the increase in oil consumption;(vi) industry; concentration of industrial effort upon dollar-saving and dollar-earning, particularly economy in use of raw materials;(vii) exports; intensification of (or starting) export drive, especially to dollar area;(viii) raw material supply; stimulation of production of raw materials whichare likely to be scarce in the non-dollar world and which could bedollar-earners, both in O.E.E.C. countries and their dependentoverseas territories;(ix) co-ordination of investment; action limited to industries with heavyunits of investment (e.g. steel, oil), but main hopes of effective actionbased upon examination of national investment programmes ratherthan on the 19 countries&apos; programmes for each commodity;(x) intra-European trade; attempt to move forward to progressive relaxation of import restrictions, provided that there is no loss of gold or dollars;(xi) less essentials; policy as in paragraph 40 above.97. Our proposals will inevitably involve a lowering of sights, both in investment and in consumption; this is the only way to get the plans on to a realistic basis. But we should not insist on open renunciation of paper &apos; ^targets &quot;which have acquired quasi-political significance; we should strongly stress a distinction between paper, targets and actual planning action, and in particular the importance of not doing things now which will increase the difficulties infor years&apos; time. In particular, consumption should not be increased above thelevel which can be afforded without assistance later.98. We should emphasise the improvement which is possible over the present state of affairs rather than the &quot; cuts &quot; in paper programmes for 1952-53. Ifwe can show a development towards viability which some countries will succeed in reaching in 1952 and others not till later, the whole concept may become morepalatable.99. In submitting our proposals, we should emphasise the need for immediate action along the lines suggested in order to ensure that the O.E.E.C. countries will be able to go forward next December with a bid for aid for 1950-51 sub-stantially less than that for 1949-50. It would be desirable, if possible, to fix a definite target now to which the O.E.E.C. countries should seek to reduce their required aid for 1950-51.100. The United Kingdom will be more able to offer assistance in the next two or three years than later on. We can give certain countries (e.g. France)considerable help now, which we shall not be able to afford when we are no longerreceiving Marshall aid. The main assistance which we can give is by contributions to the Intra-European Payments Scheme, although this may not yield the desiredresults. It may be possible also to develop a number of relatively small types of assistance, which, though not quantitatively significant or expensive, wouldbe effective. Illustrations are technical assistance of various kinds (e.g., for agriculture), or the permitting of private interests to invest capital in O.E.E.C.countries (except Belgium and Switzerland). What form of assistance will be most appropriate is not yet clear, but assistance there will have to be, and weshould offer it in submitting our proposals.101. The fact that we provide assistance and take the lead will not of coursegive us a specially favoured position; we shall have to defend and justify our ownprogramme and policy in just the same way as anybody else. There is no reason,however, why this should alarm us; our programmes are sounder than others,
and on each of the eleven points in paragraph 96 above we have a reasonablystrong case.102. In preparing this paper, v/e have examined the application of theprinciples in paragraph 96 to each of the O.E.E.C. countries. It is not proposed,however, that we should go into detail about the task of each country at the initial stage. This should be reserved for our use at the stage of examinationof country programmes envisaged in paragraph 105 below.103. On procedure, we propose that the United Kingdom proposals couldbe most effectively floated in the first instance at a meeting of the proposed new Ministerial Committee at the beginning of March. Before this, it will benecessary to have some discussion with E.C.A., and we propose that this shouldbe undertaken as soon as possible. It may suit us to reveal our proposals beforethe Ministerial Committee meets, but we cannot do so more than a few days before the Ministerial Committee, because of the danger of leakage and pressmisrepresentation.104. The strategy would be to get the Ministerial Committee to agree tothe general principles according to which the work would be tackled, and theExecutive Committee would then have the task of setting the machinery in motion.105. Our view is that the procedure should centre on the examination of country programmes fiscal policy, investment programme, viability plan ratherthan upon commodities. It is only by interrogation of countries that a realunderstanding of the problem of each country can be secured, and pressure exertedto remove anomalies. Some technical problems can be handled by 19-countrycommittees dealing with particular commodities. But the real policy questionscan be discussed only in relation to a country&apos;s position and this is the only way in which programme revisions can be induced. We should oppose formalrevision of countries&apos; programmes, with the full statistical apparatus of examina-tion and collation at this stage. It will be necessary to produce a revised O.E.E.C.joint programme for 1952-53 for submission to E.C.A. next December with thebid for the 1950-51 appropriation. But in the next few months the organisation should concentrate on the policy questions rather than on making a new statisticalassesssment for 1952-53.106. In Appendix I is shown a draft reply to a letter of M. Marjolin,the Secretary-General of O.E.E.C., raising various questions on the UnitedKingdom long-term programmes which arose from last Novembers discussions at O.E.E.C. It is proposed that this reply be approved, for presentation toM. Marjolin at our Delegation^ discretion.YI. Conclusions107. It is proposed that the paper as a whole be approved as instructions for our O.E.E.C. Delegation, and in particular decisions are sought on thefollowing points: (i) The United Kingdom must be prepared to submit its programme tothe same scrutiny and to take the same action as we propose for others (paragraph 5).(ii) We refuse to plan to provide dollars for O.E.E.C. countries at the endof E.R.P. (paragraph 34).(iii) We should advocate positive measures for dealing with commodities which are likely to be scarce in the non-dollar world (paragraphs35-37).(iv) We reject all proposals for market-sharing (paragraph 38).(v) We are willing, where prices and conditions are right, to make long-term contracts for primary produce from O.E.E.C. countries (paragraph 39).(vi) We seek agreement on policy on trade in less-essentials (paragraph 41).(vii) We show the sterling area in deficit with O.E.E.C. countries (para-graph 42).(viii) We agree to discuss &quot; integration &quot; on the lines set out in paragraphs43-49, but do not enter into commitments which would involve modifi-cation of our industrial structure and plans without further study and reference to Ministers,(ix) For planning purposes, the United Kingdom dollar programme isadjusted as in paragraph 58.
(x) The imports of coarse grains is limited to the amount included in theO.E.E.C. programme last September (paragraph 62).(xi) The coal target to be examined further after the next round in O.E.E.C.,but no pressure to be exerted on O.E.E.C. countries to increase importsfrom us (paragraph 63).(xii) We should accept the O.E.E.C. countries&apos; estimate of their needs of sterling oil, but not commit ourselves to replace dollar oil.(xiii) The import programme should be modified on the lines indicated inparagraph 81, with an additional higher programme based upon higher-   exports.(xiv) We should not at this stage submit complete a revised programme toO.E.E.C. (paragraph 84).(xv) The revised programme should be taken as a basis for current actionaffecting our long-term position (paragraph 84).(xvi) A full report should be submitted to Ministers on implications for theCommonwealth (paragraph 85).(xvii) We should put forward a course of action for O.E.E.C. countries onthe lines suggested in paragraph 96, with the presentation points in paragraphs 97-99.(xviii) We propose consideration of countries&apos; internal financial policy byO.E.E.C. in a way which will not prejudice budget secrecy (para-graph 96 (i)).(xix) The procedure in paragraphs 103-105 to be approved,(xx) The reply to M.

APPENDIX IREQUEST BY THE SECRETARY-GENERAL OF O.E.E.C. FOR FURTHERINFORMATION ABOUT THE UNITED KINGDOM LONG-TERMPROGRAMME1. Following the interrogation of the United Kingdom delegation atO.E.E.C. on the long-term programme last November, M. Marjolin put in writingthe following seven questions, and requested an early reply. Similar questionshave been asked all the other countries. The full text of M. Marjolin&apos;s letter was circulated as E.R. (P) (48) 118.2. M. Marjolin voices the main criticism which had emerged of the UnitedKingdom programme, as follows :- &quot; The programmes as now presented to the Organisation show importantdivergencies on certain points between the United Kingdom&apos;s plans on the onehand and those of the other participating countries on the other. It is essentialthat the European Recovery Programme should envisage a satisfactory balance between the sterling area as a whole and the non-sterling participating countries,taking account of such multilateral arrangements as appear likely. certain aspects of the United Kingdom programme, to which I shall revert later, havegiven rise to the fear that the achievement of this programme would cause in afew years&apos; time a scarcity of sterling for certain countries which would clearlyadd to the difficulties which the majority of participating countries will encounterin balancing their payments. This problem, which is made more acute by the traditional role played by the United Kingdom in the trade of the countries of western Europe and in their multilateral system of payments, and by theimportance which the sterling area holds for these countries both as a supplierand as a market, leads the Organisation to ask the United Kingdom Governmentfor further information which is necessary to enable it to draw up a balancedrecovery programme.&quot;He then proceeds to ask a number of questions, which call for specific reply.3.   It is proposed that our reply should be as in the Annex below.annex draft REPLY TO SECRETARY-general. The United Kingdom has re-examined its position in the light of the interim Report and the questions posed in your letter of 29th November, 1948.Before answering your specific questions we should like to make some general observations on the points which you raise.2. We agree, of course, that the European Recovery Programme shouldenvisage a satisfactory balance between the sterling area as a whole and thenon-sterling participating countries. We would emphasise, however, that itwould serve no useful purpose to attempt to &apos;&apos; plan &apos;&apos; a balance four years ahead,or to draw marked conclusions from the results of statistical analysis which is bound to be arbitrary in character. The transactions between the sterling area and the non-sterling participants are estimated at the order of $4^ billion in either direction in 1952-53; in this scale of figures, no significant conclusionscan be drawn from a small deficit in one direction or the other.3. These is no more reason why the sterling area as a whole should be in balance with the non-sterling participants as a whole than that every individualparticipating country should be in balance with the sterling area. Sterling isan international currency, and it is our intention to extend its international use;
the United Kingdom has and will continue to have large current deficits withother parts of the world (particularly the Middle East) which give participating countries considerable possibilities of acquiring sterling by exports there-possibilities of which many of the participating countries are actively taking advantage; the United Kingdom likewise may achieve surpluses in other partsof the world (e.g., certain parts of Latin America) which will help other countries to settle their deficits there. It is impossible to attribute quantities to these possibilities of multilateral payments in sterling, but they are certainly large.4. The problem which appears to us to concern certain O.E.E.C. countries is that they, as individual countries, are likely to be in deficit with the sterling area; there is likewise a problem, however, in that certain other O.E.E.C.countries are likely to be in substantial surplus with the sterling area. Ideally,a multilateral system should offset these deficits against these surpluses (not onlyamong the O.E.E.C. countries, which for this purpose are an arbitrarily chosengroup, but world-wide). But this is not possible if countries in deficit with the sterling area are not in surplus with other countries, or if countries in surpluswith the sterling area are not in deficit with other countries. The problem which appears to us to create difficulty is the existence of chronic debtors and chroniccreditors. If each country puts its balance of payments in order, these difficultiesdo not arise.5. May we take this opportunity of emphasising the importance of each country being in reasonable equilibrium, both with the dollar area and with thewhole world. If any important country is out of balance with the dollar area,intra-European trade will inevitably become distorted and dominated by each country&apos;s efforts to extract dollars from the others. If any important countryis a chronic debtor or a chronic creditor in its overall balance of payments, nomultilateral payments system which includes that country can work.6. The United Kingdom clearly does not wish to become a chronic creditorvis-a-vis the non-sterling participants. This year the sterling area is in asubstantial creditor position. In 1949-50 it is hoped that this creditor position will be greatly reduced. In 1952-53 we should not expect there to be either a significant deficit or a significant surplus; indeed, our latest examination suggeststhat a deficit is rather more likely than a surplus. We do not think that the fears of a scarcity of sterling to which you refer have any foundation.7. Question 1. Given the existence of a large net surplus in the forecast ofthe balance of current payments in the United Kingdom Programme, would theUnited Kingdom Government be ready to consider in certain cases an increase inits imports which would permit participating countries to develop their sales inGreat Britain about the figures at present given in the United KingdomProgramme ?Answer. The estimated surplus of $400 million is a necessary element in the United Kingdom long-term programme. This has to cover the needsof investment in the dependent overseas territories and elsewhere, which iscrucial to the development of new supplies of primary products and alsoto the welfare of the peoples of these territories; it must also cover the repayment of debt to countries which have accumulated large sterling balances. We cannot contemplate a reduction in this figure, and, indeed, after further examination, we consider that it may prove to be too low in relationto our commitments.8. Question 2.-Can the United Kingdom Government indicate the products in which it would wish to see such an increase ? Would it be limited to those products which, as at present foreseen, the United Kingdom proposes to buyoutside Europe ?Answer. Our plans provide for a very substantial increase in importsfrom participating countries of wheat, dairy produce, timber, &amp;c. The scope for expansion of imports from the participating countries is by no meanslimited to items which we now import from outside Europe, although it isclear that we are most interested in getting supplies from Europe whichcontribute directly to the solution of our dollar problem. But much depends upon our ability to earn by exports to Europe, and it is impossible to say we advance what this position will be.
9. Question 3. Would the United Kingdom Government consider that a partial solution of the problem outlined above might lie in the use for investment in the non-sterling participating countries of a part of the net surplus on thebalance of payments forecast in the United Kingdom Programme?Answer. We contemplate some investment in participating countrieswhich tend to be short of sterling, provided, of course, that this investmentcontributes to the solution of United Kingdom problems as well as thoseof the countries concerned.10. Question 4. Does the United Kingdom Government think that a division of labour in certain sectors, operated in particular through the co-ordina-tion of investment policies, would allow certain non-sterling participating countries to develop their sales in the United Kingdom of products that theUnited Kingdom within the framework of its general economic policy might wishto make available to its population? In what fields does the United KngdomGovernment think that eventual studies might be most profitable ?Answer. We find this question difficult to answer, for we are not clear what is precisely meant. The traditional method of securing an internationaldivision of labour is by the reduction of trade barriers. As we have saidbefore, we entirely favour this, provided that the freeing of trade does not involve us in ^additional expenditure of gold or dollars. Your question,however, appears to envisage &quot; planned &quot; action to stimulate the divisionof labour. We would prefer not to state a view on this, in the absence of specific proposals to discuss. We are bound to say, however, that this wouldappear to envisage the limitation of competition, by cartels or otherwise, insuch a way that less efficient producers would be protected; if this is so,His Majesty&apos;s Government would regard it as disadvantageous.11. Question 5. In the absence of forecasts on the operations of the sterling area as a whole it has not been possible so far to explore the possibilities open to non-sterling participating countries of earning sterling in third countries. can the United Kingdom give the Organisation, in spite of the difficulties which sucha question raises, estimates which would permit the other participating countries to determine more exactly their own position vis-a-vis the sterling area, and to bebetter able to appreciate their position vis-a-vis the United Kingdom ?Question 6. Can the United Kingdom Government give the Organisationestimates for the forecast balance of payments for the Crown Colonies for1952-53?Answer. We have made some estimates of the prospective balance ofpayments of the Colonies, and will submit them as soon as possible. As forthe non-participating sterling area countries, we have made estimates whichwe are willing to place at the Organisation^ disposal. It must be emphasised,however, that we have made these on our own responsibility for our own purposes; and of course we have no power to influence these countries&apos;policies, for they are entirely independent. We should be glad to transmitany enquiries from O.E.E.C. to Commonwealth countries.12. Question 7. To what extent and under what conditions does the UnitedKingdom Government consider that the non-sterling participating countries would be able to transfer into gold or dollars the surpluses which they might eventually achieve with the sterling area ?Answer. The non-sterling participants certainly cannot rely uponbeing able in 1952-53 to transfer surpluses with the sterling area into gold or dollars. It is, of course, our ultimate objective that this should become possible so far as current transactions are concerned, but the essential priorcondition is that the United States should be in balance with the rest of theworld, without undue discriminatory import restrictions against UnitedStates exports, i.e., that a natural world equilibrium is re-established. Itwould also be necessary for the currencies of other important tradingcountries to be likewise convertible, so that&apos; the sterling area^ surpluses withother countries could also be converted into gold or dollars.

Table V. United Kingdom Balance of Payments 1952-53Principal Changes in the United Kingdom programme a. ImportsThe original United Kingdom long-term programme was drawn up on the following assumptions: (i) A high level of employment.(ii) The maintenance year in year out of a volume of exports equal to 150 per cent, of the 1938volume.(iii) A level of raw material imports sufficient to sustain the volume of industrial activity laid downin the long-term production forecasts.(iv) An overall food consumption level as close to that of 1946-47 as the general balance ofpayments position would permit.The revision of this programme has followed existing policies. Departmental totals have notbeen changed but have taken account of new information on availabilities, switching imports betweensources as required.  In the case of cereals, however, current E.C.A. prices have been used.The general effect upon the quantities of imports of those principal commodities cheifly affectedby this revision is set out below: CommodityFood and Feeding-stuffs-Bacon ......Total net increase (-(-)or decrease (-) onoriginal long-termprogrammeThousandmetric tons     mn.4- 36-r-8Egg productsEggs in shell4- 8- 44-1-4-1-butter     ......Cheese (ration) ...Cheese (fancy)......Processed milks......Sugar     .........Fats and oils (excludingbutter)Meat, carcase, canned corned, and othercanned meats......4- 7-1- 40+2714-1-8-1-84-2-14-3-64-7-14- 34       4-8-8(crude oilequivalent)Poultry and game-174-24+ 1-34-8-0Comments (quantities inthousand metric tons)Imports from Denmark, Eire and Netherlandsunchanged.

Invisible ItemsTourism United Kingdom travel expenditure with the non-sterling participants has been reduced fromthe very high figure of $200 millions to $170 millions. This total agrees with the other countries&apos;own estimates of receipts except in the case of France and Italy, whose estimates are consideredhighly unrealistic.. Oil Sales-Oil sales to participating countries have been reduced from $760 millions to $674 millions, whichis the estimated total value of sterling oil imports in the non-sterling participants&apos; programmes. this figure may be revised when more information is received from O.E.E.C. of the quantities of products and price assumptions of other countries&apos; programmes. The additional oil made available has notbeen added to oil sales to other areas.
