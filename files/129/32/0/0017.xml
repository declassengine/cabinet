/      &quot;r:THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;8 GOYEBNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1949SECRET Copy No. 31CP. (49) 171st February, 1949CABINETNEWFOUNDLAND: CONFEDERATION WITH CANADAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations in The King&apos;s Speech at the opening of the present Session it was statedthat legislation would be laid before Parliament to give effect to whatever decisionsmight result from the negotiations for admitting Newfoundland to the CanadianConfederation.2. The detailed Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada were signed in Ottawa on 11th December, 1948, by representatives of the Canadian Govern-ment and of Newfoundland, and have since been published as a White Paper(Cmd. 7605). The terms provided that Newfoundland should enter the CanadianConfederation on 31st March, 1949.3. A Bill (The British North America Bill, 1949, of which a copy is attachedto this memorandum) confirming and giving effect to these terms has since beenprepared, for presentation in due course to the Parliament at Westminster, andwas approvecL^taSpfigHpR by the Legislation Committee at their meeting on25th January (H.P.C. (49), 3rd Meeting, Minute 1). In view of the fact thatit may be expected to meet with some opposition in Parliament, I feel that mycolleagues should be aware of and should now be asked to approve formallythe policy which it entails. ^ 14. It will be recalled that, at their meeting on 27fh November, 1945(CM. (45) 56th Conclusions, Minute 5), the Cabinet approved the proposals setout in CP. (45) 234 and 292 for enabling the people of Newfoundland to choosetheir future form of government. These proposals were, briefly, that a NationalConvention of Newfoundlanders should be elected to examine the position ofthe country and to recommend to His Majesty&apos;s Government &quot;possible formsof future government to be put before the people at a National Referendum.&quot;Subsequent events, leading up to the holding of the first referendum in June1948, were explained in CP. (47) 98 and CP. (48) 187, and are set out in greater detail in the accompanying note (Annex &quot; A &quot;).5. The British North America Bill cannot be introduced into Parliamentuntil (a) the Terms of Union of Newfoundland with Canada have beenapproved by the Canadian Parliament, and (b) an Address has been sub-mitted to The King by the Parliament of Canada. The terms of the Bill,have, however, already been approved by the Newfoundland Government and discussions with the Canadian Government on various drafting points are almost complete. The Canadian Parliament reassembled on 26th January and isexpected to devote at least a week to Newfoundland business. It is to be hopedthat the Address will have been voted by both Houses of the Canadian parliament by the middle of February. There can, of course, be no guarantee of this. But,as the Lord President of the Council and I informed the Prime Minister ofCanada during his visit to this country in October 1948, it is essential, if ourBill is to receive the Royal assent by the end of March, that the Address shouldhave been passed fairly early in February.36504 b
6. Opposition to the Bill in Parliament here is likely to be based on thesame contentions as those advanced in a petition which was presented bySir Alan Herbert at the Bar of the House of Commons on 23rd November last.This petition called for (a) the restoration of Responsible Government as it existed in 1934; ,..    :(b) the cessation of negotiations for the entry of Newfoundland intoConfederation save by representatives of a duly elected new found land government. &apos;&apos;These requests were based on the following main arguments : (1) The arrangements made when the Newfoundland Act, 1933, was passedclearly indicated that &quot; it would be understood that, as soon as the island&apos;s difficulties are overcome, and the country is again self-supporting, Responsible Government, on request from the people of new foundland, would be restored.&quot;(2) Contrary to the recommendations made by the National Convention inJanuary 1948, the question of Confederation with Canada was addedby the United Kingdom Government to the other alternative formsof government on which the people were to vote.(3) At the referendum of July 1948, less than 43 per cent, of the totalelectorate voted for Confederation.(4) The people were asked to commit themselves to Confederation without any negotiations on terms.(5) The referendum failed to take into account the terms of Section 146 ofthe British North America Act, 1867, which provided that an Addresswas required from the Houses of the Newfoundland Legislaturebefore Newfoundland could enter the Confederation;Taking these arguments in turn, the following comments may be made :-(1) The recommendation of the Royal Commission which is annexed to the newfoundland Act of 1933 was, as indicated in the above quotation,to the effect that, when the country was again self-supporting, Respoh-sible Government would be restored on request from the people of new foundland. Without entering into the question&apos; whether or notNewfoundland can now be regarded as definitely &quot; self-supporting &quot;(and this is at least doubtful in view of the exceptional financialtreatment which the new province is to receive from Canada underthe Terms of Union), the point is that no request for the restorationof Responsible Government has been made by the people of new foundland. On the contrary, the people, at two successivereferenda, were given the opportunity of returning a majority vote for Responsible Government, but at neither referendum did themajority take this course.(2) The Terms of Reference of the National Convention included these words,&quot;to make recommendations to His Majesty&apos;s Government as to possible forms of future government to be put before the people by aNational Referendum.&quot; No less than 16 out of 45 members of theConvention voted for the inclusion of Confederation with Canadaas an alternative on the ballot paper. I was, therefore, obliged to take into account this strong minority vote in the Convention. It was clearalso that there was a strong feeling in the Island that the people should be given the opportunity of voting on this alternative. To havetaken any other step would have meant the virtual disenfranchisementof a large section of the population, and my decision to include Con-federation with Canada on the ballot paper was clearly justified by theresult of the second referendum.(3) The plain facts are that at the second referendum 78,541 votes were castfor Confederation, and 71,217 for Responsible Government. The totalvote represented 85 per cent, of the electorate. 52 per cent, of allvotes cast were in favour of Confederation. Further, of the formerelectoral districts no less than 18 were for Confederation and only7 for Responsible Government, which is a very clear indication of
what the position would have been, had Newfoundland had a Legisla-ture. In a statement issued on 30th July, 1948, the Prime Ministerof Canada announced himself as satisfied that the plebiscite had indicated beyond possibility of misunderstanding that the people of new foundland were in favour of Confederation;(4) The terms presented by the Canadian Government to the NationalConvention represented the result of long discussions with a body ofNewfoundlanders elected to the Convention and selected by theConvention to discuss with Canadian Ministers the financial and othereffects of Confederation. Moreover, the terms were not final at thetime the referendum Was held, and as the Canadian Prime Ministerannounced in his statement of 30th July &quot; the (Canadian) Governmentwill ... . be glad to receive ... - authorised representatives of new foundland to negotiate the Terms of Union .... In these* negotiations any special problems which may arise in connection withthe entry of Newfoundland into the Confederation will . . . . receivemost careful consideration before a final decision is taken.&quot; Therecent discussions in Ottawa proved conclusively that the canadian government have paid full attention to Newfoundland^ interests inevery field, and, in particular, the amount of the financial assistanceto be given by Canada to the new Province has been substantially increased in comparison with the terms originally proposed.(5) This is a technical point. There is in fact:no reason why Confederationshould be brought about under the terms of Section 146 of the british north America Act, 1867. This Act could not have envisaged thepresent constitutional position of Newfoundland. In view of theresult of the referendum, it would have been contrary to the majoritydecision of the people of; Newfoundland to re-establish responsible government, even as a preliminary to negotiations for Confederation.The brief answer to the critics of the Bill is that there was no pledge in the newfoundland Act, 1933, that Responsible Government would be restored uncon-ditionally; that the people had two opportunities to vote for its restoration, butpreferred to take another course; and that they have shown by their vote that thatchoice is Confederation with Canada.It would of course be difficult, if not impossible, at this stage, for HisMajesty&apos;s Government to retreat from the policy which they have been consistentlypursuing since November 1945. All three Governments concerned, the UnitedKingdom, Canadian and Newfoundland Governments, are publicly committed tothe entry of Newfoundland into the Canadian Confederation, and the canadian parliament are known to be on the point of submitting an Address to The King, to request that an Act be passed here to give effect to the Terms of Union. In thesecircumstances, my colleagues will, I am sure, agree that the British North AmericaBill must be introduced into Parliament as soon as the Address has been received.To do otherwise would endanger the arrangements under which the date of unionhas been fixed for 31st March, 1949.P.

&apos;   &apos;&quot;&apos;.. 1/ .r&apos;, V &quot;  annex &quot;a.&quot;    ;    ; ;&apos; &apos;, J;&quot;;In September 1946, a National Convention, consisting of forty-five elected members and presided over by a Judge of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland,assembled in St. Johns.  :     , ., ,2. In May of the following year the Convention, with the consent of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, sent a delegation to the United Kingdom to enquirewhat financial and fiscal relations could be expected between the United Kingdomand Newfoundland under various forms of government. The Governor. of new foundland&apos;arid one of the Newfoundland Commissioners were presentthroughout the discussions.1 Subsequently a similar delegation visited Ottawaand discussed with Canadian Ministers and officials the numerous questions whichwould arise in the event of Newfoundland deciding to join the Canadian Con-federation. Following these talks, the Canadian Government sent to the Governor,for communication to the National Convention, the terms on which they would*beprepared to admit the Island into Confederation. These terms, and the reportby the first delegation on their earlier discussions in London, served as the basis for the final debates in St. Johns leading up to the framing of the Convention^recommendations.3. These recommendations, contained in a report of 29th January, 1948,were that the following forms of Government should be placed before the peopleat the proposed Referendum :  (1) Responsible Government as it existed prior to 1934.(2) Commission of Government.A resolution recommending that Confederation with Canada should be placed before the people of Newfoundland in the Referendum was negatived by 29 votesagainst 16.4. In a dispatch which was sent to the Newfoundland Government on 2nd March, 1948, it was pointed out that the terms offered by the canadian government represented the result of long discussions with a body of Newfound-landers who were elected to the Convention, and that the issues involved appearedto have been sufficiently clarified to enable the people of Newfoundland to express an opinion whether Confederation with Canada would commend itself to them.In these circumstances, and having regard to the number of members who supported the inclusion of Confederation with Canada in the ballot paper, theGovernor was informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government had come to the conclusionthat it would not be right that the people of Newfoundland should be deprived of an opportunity of considering this issue at the Referendum. It was, therefore,decided that the questions to be put before the people at the Referendumshould be : (a) Commission of Government for a further period of five years.(6) Responsible Government as it existed in 1933 prior to the establishmentof Commission of Government.(c) Confederation with Canada.5. The first Referendum, which took place on 3rd June, 1948, gave thefollowing results: (1) For Commission of Government, 22,311 votes.(2) For Confederation with Canada, 64,066 votes.(3) For the restoration of Responsible Government, 69,400 votes.6. As no one form of Government received an absolute majority over theother two combined, a further Referendum was held on 22nd July. This resultedin 78,323 votes for Confederation with Canada, and 71,334 votes for responsible government. Of the former electoral districts, 18 voted in favour of Confederationwith Canada and 7 in favour of Responsible Government.7. On 30th July a statement was issued by the United Kingdom Govern-ment to the effect that they had ascertained that the Canadian Government were willing to proceed with arrangements for the entry of Newfoundland into theCanadian Confederation and that the United Kingdom for their part, as the
Government at present responsible for the administration of Newfoundland, werein agreement with this. It was added that the next step would be for appointedNewfoundland representatives to go to Ottawa in order to arrange, in negotiation with representatives of&apos;:the canadian government; the final&quot; terms of the UnionThese Would later be submitted for approval to the Canadian Parliament, with1whom the final decision would rest. A statement was also issued by the PrimeMinister of Canada on the same date to a similar effect.8. The Newfoundland Delegation, which was under the Chairmanship ofMr. (now Sir Albert) Walsh, the Vice-Chairman of the Commission of Govern-ment, reached Ottawa in October^ 1948. After full discussion, agreement wasreached on the terms on which Newfoundland should enter the Canadian Con-federation, and the Terms of Union were signed on 11th December last.
