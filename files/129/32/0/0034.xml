THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITAHNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMEJNTPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 1949SECRETCP. (59) 34ISth February, 1949CABINETNORTH ATLANTIC PACTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will have read in the press of the deplorable debate which took place in the American Senate on 14th February. I attach at Annex I threetelegrams giving Sir Oliver Franks&apos;s comments on this debate, which I need hardlysay had a depressing effect on M. Lange and has no doubt also encouraged theSoviet Government and their sympathisers all over the world.2. The immediate point to be considered is how far ought we to go in accepting the greatly modified version of Article 5 of the proposed North atlantic treaty which will probably be acceptable to Senators in the light of this debate.I attach at Annex II the draft Article 5 (a) as it emerged from the last, meeting of the Ambassadors&apos; Committeein Washington;(b) as subsequently modified on 4th February to meet the Senators&apos;preliminary objections; and(c) as now proposed publicly by Senator Connally, apparently at the sugges-tion of the State Department.Even in the event of this last version being accepted, however, it has beensuggested by some Senators that it would not connote even a moral obligation on the part of the United States to go to war if a co-signatory of the Pact isthe victim of recognised aggression, though no doubt in such circumstances theUnited States would go to war, more especially of course if United States armed forces had previously engaged in hostilities. Mr. Acheson is no doubt doing his best to wrestle with the Senators, and we shall know the result of his efforts ina few days time when the Ambassadors&apos; Committee reassembles.3. Clearly draft (&amp;) is better than draft (c), since it retains the thoughtthat an attack on one is an attack on all and does not specifically say that the determination of any action that any party may take is a matter for individualjudgment. Our Ambassador is doing his best to keep as much stiffening in theArticle as possible, and in particular to restore the words &quot; military or other action &quot; which appear in draft (a) but not in (6) or (c). If, however, all that wecan get the Senators to agree to is Senator Connally&apos;s version, we shall have todecide whether a Pact so weakened is still worth signing. (I need not herediscuss the further unsolved difficulties, such as the definition of the area; whetherItaly should be excluded; whether Algeria should be within the scope of theTreaty, and so forth, since, though important, they are all largely dependent onthe solution adopted in regard to Article 5, and cannot be dealt with satisfactorilyuntil that has been settled.)4. First of all we must be clear on one thing: what we have to decide is,would it be better to have the Pact as watered down by the Senate than not tohave any Pact at all. Even with the feeble version of Article 5 we should stillpresumably secure consultative machinery and, above all, the establishment of amilitary committee which would be capable of drawing up plans and of dividingup the available arms among the signatory Powers. By such means we could, ofcourse, hope that, when and if the aggression came, the operative clause(Article 5) would be of less importance since, under the various schemes andCopy No.36594b
xForeign Office, S.W. 1.18th February, 1949.plans adopted by the military committee, a situation would have been created in which, in fact, the United States would not able to avoid being involved inthe conflict whatever view the Senate took as to its technical right in regard tothe declaration of war. In the end, I suppose it is the existence of preparedcommon plans, rather than of paper commitments, which usually proves effective in determining a Government to go to war in aid of an ally.5. On the other hand, I cannot say what the views of my Brussels Treatycolleagues are, and notably the French. The French have unhappy memories ofbeing let down by the Americans in 1919, and it may be that the ParliOpposition to the present Government in France would profit by the obvious lackof teeth in the Pact as drafted to cause the defeat of the Government if it acceptedit and endeavoured to get it ratified by the National Assembly. On the other hand,a weakening of Article 5 would also mean a loosening of French and other european commitments in the event of a Soviet-American conflict in some other part of the world, and might therefore help certain elements in French opinion to accept the Pact. However, this can only be found out by consultation withthe French themselves, and I hope to ascertain their views in the permanent commision.6. It may be, however, that it might be best for tactical purposes for allthe Brussels Treaty Powers to tell the Americans that they could not guarantee the acceptance of the Pact by their own Parliaments if it were redrafted inaccordance with the Senate&apos;s wishes. This being so, they would requestMr. Acheson to go back to the Senators and try to induce them to stiffen up theArticle, if not to the extent of accepting the original version as it came out of theAmbassadorial Committee, at any rate to the extent of making it clear that military aid would be afforded by America to a co-signatory which the UnitedStates Senate had itself recognised as victim of aggression. This end might,I suggest, be achieved by inserting the phrase &quot; according to its own Constitu-tional processes &quot; after the words &quot; by taking forthwith &quot; in the text of Article 5,which would make it clear that nothing could be done except with Senatorialconsent.7. The article as it would then appear, is given as the fourth alternative(d) in Annex II.E. B.
SECRETTelegrams from Sir Oliver Franks1. No. 938 of 15th February, Senate debate on North Atlantic Pact.You will have seen in the newspapers accounts of the discussion on the atlantic Pact which took place yesterday in the Senate. We have now had timeto study the full text in the record which we are sending you by bag together witha covering letter.2.   In the meantime you may be interested in the following impressions: (A) The debate was impromptu and it seems clear that several Senators spokewithout very much thought regarding the exact meaning of what theywere saying, still less its repercussions abroad;(B) the most important fact is that Vandenberg tried to minimise the extentto which the United States was committed to take action under theRio Treaty and went on to insist that a similar complete reservationconcerning American decision to act must be made plain in the AtlanticPact. He rested his case on the belief that &apos;&apos; the mere formal recognition &apos;&apos; of the community of interests of the Atlantic countries would be the best assurance against another war almost regardless ofthe form which the wording took;(C) Connally&apos;s intervention was lamentable and served only to make mattersinfinitely worse. Senator Borah himself could hardly have done betterwith his remarks, cautioning the United States against playing the role of Sir Galahad and plunging into war every time a gun was firedand similar inanities such as &quot; letting European nations declare warand letting us fight&apos;&apos;;(D) The voices of Lodge and Knowland were the only ones of the half-dozenspeakers raised in opposition to all this negative emphasis.2. No. 939 of 15th FebruaryMy telegram No. 938.Senate debate on North Atlantic Pact.While the debate, -coming as it did on top of the Norwegian affairs, isunfortunate in that it may still further delay matters and, while we may regretsome of the remarks made in the Senate, more especially by Senator Connally,we should not, I think take matters too tragically, nor feel that the debate inany way implied that Congress was opposed to the principle of a closer association,in some form of pact, between the United States and the countries of western europe. The debate will certainly have the effect of making Acheson redoublehis efforts to push on with his talks with the Senators and speed up the businessof reaching agreement with the Ambassadors in Washington on the actual text of the pact. I think (and in this both my Netherlands and Belgian colleagues agree) that it would be a mistake for the Brussels GoA^ernments to say anything to the State Department about the debate and that we ought to do what wecan to persuade our own newspapers to adopt an attitude of restraint a line which I see from your telegram 1850 you are already taking in London.2. There was bound to be a rambling debate of this sort in the Senatesome time and although, as I have reported, there has been surprisingly little opposition to the idea of the pact from the press and public opinion as a whole,it does involve a very radical reversal of traditional United States policy and,in view of the amount of publicity it has recently attracted, it is only natural that some of the Senators should have been inquisitive and dubious about itsproposed terms.3. The State Department have, during the Washington discussions,repeatedly referred to the necessity for carrying the Senate along with them at all stages of the negotiations but I am afraid the plain fact is that theyhave made a bad job of doing so. During December and January, Lovett said on several occasions that he was in close touch with Senate leaders and, after36594 b 2
-a morning spent by Bohlen and himself in mid-January on Capitol Hill, theState Department assured us that everything had gone well and that Senateleaders seemed quite happy about the broad implications of the draft treaty. Itseems doubtful, however, whether the State Department can have consulted theSenators in any detail about the actual provisions of the treaty or whether they took Connally into their confidence.4. At all events, it was only after Acheson came into office and starteddiscussing matters with Connally and Vandenberg that we heard of objectionby the two Senators to the wording of Article 5. Connally has undoubtedly been more awkward than Vandenberg. He is of course a man of lesser calibre andmay not fully understand the issues involved. But I suspect that he is jealousof Vandenberg and disposed to be difficult about the North Atlantic Pact onthe grounds that it derives largely from the Vandenberg resolution. He wouldalso no doubt like to establish a position for himself as chairman of the Foreigndelations Committee comparable to that previously held by Vandenberg and isno doubt anxious to assert his own independence and that of the Senate vis-a-vis the State Department and the new Secretary of State. The fact, too, that he is.an old man and naturally conservative may make him genuinely hesitant aboutthe idea of &quot;entangling alliances.&quot;5. I think Vandenberg&apos;s attitude is somewhat different. He undoubtedlywants a strong pact and I am not too worried about what he said yesterdayin the Senate. It is part of his technique, if he wants something badly, to avoidshowing his feelings too obviously in the early stages. He may have felt yesterdaythat he would only have stultified his position had he disclosed his full support for the Pact.6. However that may be, and unwise though it is to make predictions, Ithink that, as I said above, it would be wrong to be too disturbed by the debate.But I think the debate will encourage the Senators to continue their oppositionto a reference to &apos;&apos; military action&apos;&apos; and that they may insist that Article 5should state clearly that each Government should decide for itself what actionit will take in the event of an attack. Acheson will no doubt do what he canto persuade the Senators to modify their attitude. I am afraid, however, that,in the light of the debate, the Senators may be hard to shift and that we maywell be asked by Acheson to submit to our Governments a revised text on thelines desired by the Senatois.3. No. 965 of 16th FebruaryMy telegram No. 498 : North Atlantic Pact.When I saw Acheson to-day in connexion with the signing of the Anglo-American Consular Convention, he spoke to me for a few minutes about theNorth Atlantic Pact and, in particular, about the formula for Article 5 suggestedpublicly by Senator Connally (at, as we know, the instigation of the state department).   He asked me what I thought of this revised text.2. I explained that I had no idea what your views or those of the other interested Governments on the Connally text would be. I could, therefore, onlyspeak entirely personally. Acheson then asked what I thought of the insertion of the words &quot;as it may deem necessary &apos;&apos; in place of the words &apos;&apos; as may benecessary &quot; in arguing that, since it was everywhere agreed that the decision as to what action individual Governments should in practice take would infact always be taken by those individual Governments themselves, it was difficultto maintain that this should not be spelled out in the Article. I told him that,while I would have preferred the original wording, I appreciated his point and did not see any very great objections to the new draft provided that it was clearly understood both by the United States Administration and by Congress that its adoption would not in any way preclude joint consultations, military staff talks,advance planning, &amp;c, taking place between the parties to the Pact. However,I went on to say I could not agree to the revised wording unless the words&apos;&apos; military or other &apos;&apos; Were re-inserted before &apos;&apos; measures &apos;&apos; earlier in the Article.I said that this seemed to be much the most important point of all and that toleave out these words would have a most unfortunate effect on public opinion allover Europe, where it was now known that it had originally been intended toinclude these words.  To omit them would be regarded as a clear indication that
the one form of action which the United States Government did not contemplatetaking was military. It was, in my view, most important that it should bemade clear to the world at large that in fact the parties to the treaty wereprepared, in certain eventualities, to consider taking military action.3. Acheson then asked if it would make things any easier if the word&apos;&apos; forthwith &apos;&apos; were to be re-inserted. I told him that while I would welcomethis, I did not regard it as of great importance. Certainly it would not make upfor the omission of &quot; military or other.&quot; I made it clear, that the Article mustbe regarded as a whole and that the individual phrases could not be dealt withpiecemeal. We did not discuss the alterations proposed by Connally in the earlier part of the Article.4. Later in the day the French Ambassador summoned a meeting of the brussels Powers representatives. After giving the latter an account of what had transpired during the Norwegian Foreign Ministers visit to London, forwhich they were very grateful, I told them of my conversation with Acheson. Theyseemed generally to agree with the line which I had taken and to feel that theConnally text was open to grave objection. In addition to the points I had madewith Acheson, they clearly attached importance to retention of first passage oforiginal Article 5 and of reference to assisting the parties attacked. It was decidedto ask Acheson to summon an early meeting of the seven, at which it was hopedhe would be able to give the considered views of the United States Governmenton Article 5. It was agreed, however, that it would be a mistake to cause Achesonany embarrassment in his discussions with the Senators and that it should bemade clear to him that we did not want to press for an immediate discussionof Article 5 if he thought this would make things more difficult, and that we shouldbe ready, if he preferred, to discuss other topics, such as Italy.5. On the latter point, it was generally agreed, in view of Acheson&apos;s remarks to the Norwegian Foreign Minister, that a firm effort should be made to extractfrom him a definite statement of the American views on the admission of Italy.Incidentally, it became apparent that the French Ambassador was still under theimpression that it was definitely agreed at the Consultative Council that the brussels Powers should now take initiative in withdrawing their opposition toItaly&apos;s admission. He agreed that there was a good deal of misunderstandingover what had actually happened at the Consultative Council and will, I think,ask Paris to try and clear matters up.ANNEX IIATLANTIC PACTAlternative Drafts of Article 5(a) As drafted by last meeting of Ambassadorial CommitteeThe Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europeor North America shall be considered an attack against them all, and consequentlythat, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of indi-vidual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of theUnited Nations, will assist the party or parties so attacked by taking forthwithsuch military or other action, individually and in concert with the other Parties,as may be necessary to restore and assure the security of the North Atlantic area.(b) As subsequently modified by State Department to meet the Senators&apos; pre-liminary objectionsThe Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europeor North America shall be considered an attack against them all; and consequentlythat, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of indi-vidual and collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of theUnited Nations, will assist the party or parties so attacked by taking action,individually and in concert with the other parties, to restore and assure the securityof the North Atlantic area.
