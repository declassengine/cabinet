this document is the property op his britannic majesty&apos;8 governmentPrinted for the Cabinet. February 1949CABINETCOUNCIL OF europe memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs at their meeting on 28th January the Cabinet approved a directive fromthe Consultative Council of the Brussels Treaty to the Permanent Commissionconcerning the establishment of a Council of Europe. This is attached at Annex I.In accordance with this directive the Permanent Commission has now prepared the attached draft proposals for the constitution of the Council(Annex II). The proposals are not yet in final form, and the points on whichpreliminary agreement has not yet been secured have been placed in brackets.When finally approved by Governments, this paper is intended to form the basisof discussion at a Conference to which will be invited, not only the five BrusselsPowers, but also Italy, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Eire, all of whom have indicated their willingness to accept. I hope that it will be possible to convenethis Conference some time in March. As regards the draft proposals I havethe following comments to make: 1. The Form of the DraftIt was felt that, although the Brussels Powers must agree on the general principles, they ought to present their proposals in as flexible a form as possibleso as not to give the impression that they were dictating to the other Powers atthe Conference. The draft is not, therefore, couched in legal language, but is merely a series of principles and proposals. At the same time it was felt bythe Permanent Commission that a distinction should be made between-(a) points of principle, on which the Five Brussels Powers would agreeconfidentially among themselves before the Conference not to acceptamendments save by mutual agreement; and(b) other points on which they would be at liberty to accept amendmentswithout prior agreement.The draft shows (by a marginal line) which points are to be regarded as points of principle. My colleagues will appreciate that this system will prevent, say,the French from re-opening at the Conference, in the presence of other Powers,the basic points of principle agreed in the Consultative Council. Without such anarrangement, indeed, we might find ourselves once again having to oppose all kinds of undesirable suggestions for increasing the powers of the Assembly, and forconverting it into something much more nearly resembling a European Parliament.2. Seat of the CouncilThere is general agreement that the seat of the Council shall be Strasbourg.This will avoid any jealousies which might result from placing it in the capital of one of the Powers. Strasbourg is also likely to be acceptable to the new WestGerman State, which I hope will eventually become a member of the Council.I understand that the facilities are entirely adequate.36592 BO -i-SECRET Copy No.9 -jG.P. (49) 3S18th February, 1949
3. Numbers of Representatives in the Consultative AssemblyIt was agreed that the draft proposals should not specify the numbers ofrepresentatives in the Assembly from each country. The Permanent commission has, however, suggested -rightly in my view-th Five Brussels powers should reach agreement confidentially on this subject among themselves beforethe Conference and not go back on it during the Conference except by commonconsent. 1 proposed that all the major European Powers (i.e., the UnitedKingdom, France, Italy and Germany) should have equal representation, and thishas been agreed. Clearly this will avoid much friction in the future and prevent,e.g., the Germans from claiming larger direct representation than the other great powers in view of their potentially larger population.Actual numbers have not yet, however, been fixed. The Belgians have proposed18 and the French 20 for the major Powers, with corresponding numbers for the smaller Powers: Holland, Belgium and Sweden 6, Norway, denmark and Eire 4, and Luxembourg 3. If the French proposal is agreed this wouldmake a total of 93, rising to 113 when Germany joins. If the major powers have 20 however, it is probable that the smaller Powers will also ask for anincrease with the result that the grand total (with Germany) would be about 120.I should have preferred smaller numbers all round say 15 for the major powers, and proportionately less for the others. Belgium and Holland have,however, made it plain that 6 is the minimum which will enable them to ensureadequate representation of the various elements in their national life, and luxembourg mentions that, for the same reason, 3 would be the minimum.At the risk of raising the total number of representatives in the assembly to well over 100 if Germany and other Powers, such as Portugal, Greece and turkey come in, I am, therefore, inclined if my colleagues agree-to accept theBelgian proposal referred to above, but not to go further.4. Procedure for enabling the Assembly of Us own initiative to place. Items on\its Agenda.It will be seen that there are two sets of alternative proposals to cover thisquestion, which is dealt with in paragraph 5 (6) and paragraph 11 (b) of the*   draft proposals.The intention of the Consultative Council, expressed in its directive to thePermanent Commission, was that before the Assembly could of its own initiativeplace a question on its agenda it must first be approved by (a) a two-thirds majority of all the members of the Assembly, and (b) a two-thirds majority ,ofthe Committee of Ministers. This arrangement is provided for by Alternative 1of paragraph 5 (&amp;) and Alternative 2 of paragraph 11 (ft) of the attached draft.Two modifications of this original arrangement have now been proposed, one by myself, and the other by the French. My own proposal (Alternative 1 ofparagraph 11 (6) is that a question may be put on the agenda of the Assemblyby a majority, not of all its members, but merely of those members present and voting.   This is less restrictive than the original directive; but it will, I think.give a useful appearance of greater freedom to the Assembly, and cannot really3 dangerous so long as items so approved still require the consent of a two-thirds majority of the Committee of Ministers before they can be discussed.The French proposal is that a question may be put on the agenda of theAssembly provided it has the approval of a two-thirds majority of all membersof the Assembly and merely of a simple majority of the Committee of Ministers.The French argument is that it is unnecessarily restrictive to insist on two-thirdsmajorities in both the Assembly and the Council of Ministers.My own view is that the French proposal is likely to be more acceptable to public opinion; but I am afraid that by reducing the Committee of Ministers vetoto a simple majority we shall run a serious risk of getting undesirable items onto the Assembly&apos;s agenda. I think it would, therefore, be essential not to go beyond our original proposal as modified by myself, i.e., a two-thirds vote in theAssembly of members &quot;present and voting&quot; and a two-thirds majority of theCommittee of Ministers.I might add that the Belgian Government have agreed to these last pro-posals provided as far as the Assembly is concerned abstentions are countedas votes: that is to say they wish the Assembly&apos;s decisions to be taken by two-thirds of those present; but not of those present and voting. The effect of thisprovision would normally be to make decisions dependent on a larger majoritythan under my plan, but on a smaller one than that contemplated in the decision
of the Consultative Council. In other words, it is a half-way house proposal.Unless my colleagues feel strongly on the subject, however, I shall be reluctant toaccept, it, since the Slavs (for obvious reasons) are trying to get it adopted in theUnited Nations, and its adoption by the Council of Europe might serve as a usefulprecedent.5.   Sooial, Cultural and Juridical QuestionsMy colleagues will see from paragraph 10 (6) of Annex II that the Assemblymay, on its own initiative, and without the approval of the Committee ofMinisters, discuss social, cultural and juridical problems of interest to the member nations. I put forward this proposal in order to give greater freedom to the working of the Assembly in a field where it could do no harm. This, Ithink, would be desirable from the point of view of public opinion. If mycolleagues think it would be safer, I could try to get inserted something to thematter to be discussed is or.is not entirely cultural, social or juridical, the Com-mittee of Ministers must decide; but I doubt whether this would really be wiseor necessary.6.   Economic QuestionsIt was originally suggested by the Sub-Committee of the Committee on european Unity that some provision should be included in the Statute of theCouncil of,Europe to prevent the Assembly duplicating or interfering with thework of other international European bodies, by which phrase &quot;was meant, inthe first instance, the O.E.E.C. It.is now suggested, however (see paragraph 10(c) (i)), that the Assembly should be given the power to discuss economic matters-subject, of course, to the consent of the Committee of Ministers provided thatthey do not fall within the province of other international organisations such as this is obviously better, to my mind at least, since it asserts positively thatthe Assembly may discuss economic matters in principle, subject only to such discussion not encroaching on the preserves of the O.E.E.C. I hope, therefore,that my colleagues will agree to this new insertion.7. Overseas territories the clause at 10 (c) (iii) is strongly supported by the French and the Dutch,and to some extent, also by the Belgians: It has already been watered down fromthe original proposal, which talked about the &quot;association&quot; of overseas Statesand territories in special relationship with member countries with the Council ofEurope. I still think, however, that it would be better to have ho such rjaragraphat all, but if I cannot induce my colleagues to agree, I propose to accept this phrasein the last resort.effect that, in the eventAssembly over whether aO.E.E.C.recommendations i ask my colleagues to accept the draft proposals in Annexpoints made in this paper.II subject to theE.
