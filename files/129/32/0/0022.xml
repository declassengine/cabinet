PHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)secret,P.(u10)  22 COPY NO.314TH FEBRUARY, 1949CABINETINDONESIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for foreign AffairsNow that the United Nations Security Council has passed the American-sponsored resolution designed to achieve a settlement of the Indonesian problem, it is desirable toconsider future developments.2. Whatever course events may take in the next fewmonths, it seems clear that sooner or later Indonesia will emerge as a self-governing state and will be a factor inAsiatic and also in world affairs.3. It is the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom to welcome such a development and to assist in bringing it about.   But there are several dangers ahead:(a) So far as the Dutch are concerned, there is the danger that the Security Council may seek to impose a policy which theDutch cannot implement and which may force them into floutingthe authority of the Security Council.   This may lead to theimposition of sanctions by the Security Council, whereupon theNetherlands might withdraw from the United Nations.   Any such development would be bound to weaken the position of theNetherlands in the Western Union, and to that extent would weaken Western Union itself.   In Indonesia it will do no good to undermine the authority of the existing sovereign power at a time when an Indonesian government is in no way ready totake over power.(b) So far as the Indonesians are concerned there is thedanger that they will focus their attention exclusively ongetting rid of the Dutch and devote too little attention topreparations for the transfer of power by the Dutch.   There isalso a danger that the Security Council&apos;s Commission on Indonesiawill intervene to such an extent in the negotiations that the indonesians may leave matters too much in the hands of united nations agents and not face up to their responsibilities inregard to a common policy agreed among themselves, and in regardto control of Indonesian forces.   The result may be that, whenthey achieve self-government, there will be a state of disorder in the country, a general breakdown in the machinery of government through weakness and inexperience, and that the independent state of Indonesia will emerge as another centre of instabilityin the Par East rather than, as v/e hope, a peaceful, orderly anddemocratic member of the Asiatic anti-Communist group,   if thetransfer of power is not planned with care, and if the indonesians do not now begin to look to the future as well asthe present, such a situation is almost certain to arises

198(c)   Finally, there is a very serious danger that ourrelations, both with Asiatic nations and certain members of theCornmonwealth on the one hand, and with Western Union powers onthe other, will be Jeopardised by the failure of both these groups to realise the actual issues at stake, which have becomeobscured as a result of the natural indignation aroused bythe behaviour of the Butch.A-. The magnitude of the task in Indonesia is such thatno agency of the United Nations can hope to bring about asatisfactory solution by its own efforts alone *   As in other cases which have come before the Security Council, a successful outcome is only possible if both parties to the dispute can be induced themselves to make a real effort to achieve it.In Indonesia, it is the Indonesians who from now on have got todo the spadework if they are to be in a position adequately to perform the full functions of government by 1st July, 1950,when the transfer of power is due to take place in accordancewith the Security Council resolution.   For&quot;the Dutch, their dutylies in facilitating the progress towards self-government andnot interfering with the process.5. The first step is to be the creation of a FederalInterim Government by 15th March, 1949.    In order to do this,it will be necessary for the Federalists and the Republicans tocome to an agreement on the composition of such a government,and they should be urged to get on with this.   When the FederalInterim Government has been set up, it is to be hoped that itwill have sufficient influence to put a stop to guerilla warfare and sabotage, which can only increase the existing chaos inthe country.   The cessation of these activities should render it possible for the cease-fire to become a reality instead ofa farce as it is at present.6. Not until the cease-fire has become really operativeand the authority of the Federal Interim Government is establishedwill it be possible to proceed seriously to the next step, whichis the holding of elections throughout Indonesia by 1st October.In view of the necessity of preparing electoral rolls,  it willbe by no means easy to complete the procedure by the due date.In addition to this task, the Federal Interim Government willhave to create a police force,  and to build up the federalarmed forces of Indonesia against the transfer of power.   the example of Burma makes it clear that private armies must be abolished and that the only forces in existence at the transferof power apart from the Dutch forces (which should then finallywithdraw) should be the federal Indonesian forces under the direct control of the central government,7. After the elections have been held, it will presumablybe possible to set up the new Government of the United Statesof Indonesia, and in the few months which will then remain itwill be necessary to ensure that the machinery of government functions smoothly in order that the transfer of power con takeplace on 1st July, 1950, with the minimum of dislocation.8. In all the above, clearly the Agency of the security council can obviously help.   But however large the Agency may be,and1 however many observers it may have, it will be impossiblefor it to exercise more than a general supervision over these- developments in so vast an area.    It can smooth over difficulties and iron out disputes, but it cannot govern.    It can urgeupon the Dutch the relincjuishment of authority in this or thatsphere when it is clear that the Indonesians are capable of taking over.   But it should be careful not to undermine Dutchauthority before the Indonesians are ready to assume a given

199responsibility, since no authority at all will result in chaos.The principle must surely be that one administration mustbe in effective control until another administration is in aposition to assume that control.    The fact that definitedates have been set for the various stages leading to thetransfer of power should safeguard the Indonesians from any danger that the Dutch will deliberately delay the hand-over,always provided that the United Nations Agency holds awatching brief.    There is a greater danger that the indonesians will not bestir theinselves sufficiently to be readyto take over efficiently when the time comes,9. It emerges from the above that our influence must beused in tv/o directions:-(1)    to urge the Dutch to give every facility to theUnited Nations Agency and its observers and to the indonesians to push on with the various steps necessary before the transfer of power takes place;(2)    to bring home to the Indonesians, more especiallyin view of their temperament and comparativeinexperience, the paramount necessity of reaching agreement among themselves and of proceeding withall speed to undertake the measures necessary tocomplete the various stages in the transfer of power *It is true that we are not represented on the United nations commission, though we may expect to be asked to provideobservers and have in fact military observers on the spot.    Onthe other hand, as a permanent member of the Security Council,the United Kingdom has a responsibility to see that a satis-factory solution is reached in accordance with the Council&apos;resolution of 28th January.   From the point of view of our ownrelations with the other countries of the Commonwealth, withAsiatic countries and with the &quot;Western Union, it is equallyessential that a solution should be achieved,  since until it is achieved we shall continue to be exposed to the dangers outlinedat the beginning of this memorandum.RECOMMENDATIONS(l)    If my colleagues agree with the above analysis ofthe Indonesian situation, I recommend that we should as soon as possible make known our views, as set out above, to the- United States Government, in view ofthe fact that they are not only represented on theUnited Nations Commission, but have also taken a leading part in the Security Council, both in bringing the Indonesian situation to its attention in Paris and in putting forward resolutions.(2)    Since the Indonesian question was raised in therecent meeting of the Consultative Council of theWestern Union, I recommend that I be authorised tocommunicate our general attitude to the Indonesianquestion, as set out above,, to the Western Unionpowers through the diplomatic channel.

(3)    I also invite my colleagues to consider whetherv/e should not clarify our position v/ith the othercountries of the Commonwealth, and in particularAustralia., India and Ceylon, in order to remove the misapprehensions which obviously exist as toour policy.E *B foreign Office, S.W.I.kth February, 1949*
