THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1949SECRETC.P. (49) 510th January, 1949CABINETIRELANDMemorandum by the Prime minister with CP. (49) 4 I circulated the report of the official working party whichhas been considering action consequential upon Eire&apos;s ceasing to be a memberof the Commonwealth. As stated in. that paper, the proposals put forward onbehalf of the Northern Ireland Government have since been discussed with northern Ireland Ministers; and, in the light of those discussions, I now submit for the Cabinefs consideration the following modifications of the recommenda-tions made by the official working party.2. Constitutional Safeguards-The working party suggested (paragraphs10-11 of their report) that the leaders of the other political parties at Westminstermight join me in reaffirming my assurance that &quot; no change shall be made inthe constitutional status of Northern Ireland without Northern Ireland&apos;s freeagreement.&quot; I was not attracted by this suggestion and I have verified that itwould not satisfy the Northern Ireland Government. They have pressed for some form of statutory declaration and, further, have asked that this should be framedin terms which safeguard the territorial integrity of Northern Ireland.It is clear from Part I of the working party&apos;s report that the decision notto regard Eire as a foreign country despite her secession from the Commonwealthwill involve legislation by the Parliament at Westminster. I recommend thatin this legislation Parliament should dselaj^^s4^^Ireland remains partof His Majesty&apos;s dominions and of the United Kingdom and should affirm thatin no event will Northern Ireland or any part thereof cease to be part of HisMajesty&apos;s dominions and of the United Kingdom without the consent of the parliament of Northern Ireland. The draft Bill annexed to CP. (49) 4 has been revised to reflect the results of the discussions with Northern Ireland Ministers,and a copy of the revised draft is attached. A provision to this effect will befound in Clause 1 (1) (b) of the revised draft. The long title of the revised draft also makes specific reference to the territorial integrity of Northern Ireland.This Parliament cannot of course bind its successors; and a statutory provision on these lines could be repealed or modified by a subsequent Parliament.This is clearly appreciated by the Northern Ireland Government; but, even so,they think it valuable that Parliament should make a solemn declaration andaffirmation in these terms. I share that view, and I hope the Cabinet will agree,that this provision should be included in the Bill.3. Defence of Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Government areapprehensive that the anti-Partition campaign which is now being fostered bythe Eire Government may give rise to civil disturbance in Northern Ireland.Rumours are already rife that I.R.A. contingents are drilling in parts of Eirenear the Border, and suggestions are beginning to be made that the UlsterVolunteers should be re-established as a defence against possible outbursts bygunmen from the South. The Northern Ireland Government are most anxious that these anxieties should be allayed. With this in view the Prime Ministerof Northern Ireland asked, in our recent discussions, whether I could give apublic assurance that, if need arose, British troops would be used to defend36391 copy No.31
Northern Ireland against aggression, as they would be used to defend any other part of the United ^Kingdom. I should welcome the views of my colleagues onthe expediency of my making such a statement. If such an assurance is to begiven, it would be appropriate to give it in explaining the significance of clause 1. (1) (6) of the Ireland Bill on the Second Reading of that Bill in theHouse of Commons. , Hi. . f4. Titles. The majority of the working party recommended that NorthernIreland should henceforward be known as &quot; Ulster &quot; and that the correspondingchanges should be made in The King&apos;s title and in the titles, of the -UnitedKingdom and of the Parliament at Westminster. The Commonwealth relations office preferred that the North should continue to be known as &quot;NorthernIreland.&quot; The arguments on both sides were summarised in paragraph 19 ofthe working party&apos;s report.The consideration which weighed most with me and with the other Ministerswhom I consulted was that the proposed use of the title &apos;; Ulster&apos;&apos; was likely to provoke acute controversy among Irishmen in other Commonwealth countries.This in itself would be unfortunate : but, even worse, it would aggravate thedifficulties of securing the agreement of other Commonwealth Governments tothe necessary change in The King&apos;s title. In discussion with the Northern ireland ministers we found that they were not disposed to press very strongly for theadoption of the title &quot; Ulster.&quot; Their main anxiety was that the UnitedKingdom Government should not formally admit the Eire Governments.claimto the title &quot; Ireland &quot; and thereby prejudice the Partition issue. They wouldhave preferred that we should continue to use &quot; Eire &quot; as a formal description ofthe twenty-six counties. We convinced them that, as by international usage; a country is free to determine its own title, it would be fruitless for us to try to secure international acceptance of the term &quot; Eire &quot; as a title for the South,and: that we had no practical alternative but to recognise the new title taken inthe Republic of Ireland Act. At the same time-, we explained that we shouldmake it clear in our legislation that the term &quot;Republic of Ireland &quot; applied only to the territory which had hitherto been known as Eire (i.e., the twenty-six counties); and that we should be careful in all official usage to refer to the south as &quot; the Republic of Ireland &quot; or &quot; the Irish Republic &quot; reserving &quot; Ireland-&quot;as a-geographical description of the island as a whole. In colloquial usage itwould no doubt be possible to mark the distinction by speaking of &quot; southern ireland &quot; and &quot; Northern Ireland.&quot; We added that we should also be preparedto recommend a change in The King&apos;s title by which &quot; Northern Ireland &quot; wouldbe substituted for &quot; Ireland.&quot; This last point made a great appeal to the NorthernIreland Ministers; and on this basis they were content that we should formallyrecognise the title &quot;Republic of Ireland &quot; as a description of the twenty-six counties and should continue to use &quot;Northern Ireland&quot; as a description ofthe North.I commend this solution to the Cabinet. It involves no change in the titles ofthe United Kingdom or of the Parliament at Westminster, and the minimumchange in the Royal Style and Title. There should be little difficulty or delay in securing the consent of other Commonwealth Governments to this simple changein The King&apos;s title. Their consent ought to be obtained before we here introduceany legislation, or make any announcement, foreshadowing any change inThe King&apos;s title. The draft Bill annexed to this paper gives effect to the proposals put forward above. .5. Boundary of Northern Ireland (paragraph 23 of the working party&apos;sreport). We convinced the Northern Ireland Ministers that it would be highlyinexpedient to raise with the Eire Government at this stage any questions whichmight provoke legal argument about the boundary between the North and theSouth. The Northern Ireland Government have, however, a practical problemconnected with the fisheries in the Foyle, on which it is difficult for them to avoidtaking any action, since the holders of the fisheries rights have applied to themto protect the fisheries against poaching, having failed to obtain an injunction inthe Eire courts. To meet this difficulty the Northern Ireland Government proposeto try to reach friendly agreement with the Eire Government for the establishmentof a public fishery under the control of a joint board operating on behalf of thetwo Governments. In this approach to the Eire Government they will avoidraising the boundary question or putting forward any claims based on legalrights to the fisheries. &quot;&apos;
I welcome any such attempt to initiate joint collaboration by agencies of thetwo Governments on practical matters of administration not involving: political issues.6. Irish Lights Commission. The Northern Ireland Ministers were per-persuaded that, for the reasons given in paragraph 24 of the working party&apos;s report,it would be inexpedient to propose that control over the Northern Ireland light-houses should be transferred from the Irish Lights Commissioners. They werenot, however, impressed by the suggestion that we should try to secure for NorthernIreland adequate representation on the Irish Lights Commission. They pointedout that the United Kingdom Government had a greater interest than they in the efficient administration of the Irish lights; and that it would be preferable thatthe interested Departments of the United Kingdom Government should be enabled to have a voice in this administration. They explained that the most importantpractical objective was to secure that reliable people were employed in the Irishlighthouses; and that there would be a better chance of securing this if some of themembers of the Commission were persons nominated by the United KingdomGovernment. That Government would have grounds for making this proposalsince the revenues of the Commission were largely derived from dues levied on ships entering ports in Great Britain.I recommend that the Commonwealth Relations Office, after consultationwith the Admiralty and Ministry of Transport, should submit to the Eire Govern-ment proposals for securing adequate representation of United Kingdom interests on the Irish Lights Commission.7. Extra-territorial powers. The Northern Ireland Ministers were informed, as recommended in paragraph 25 of the working party&apos;s report, thatwe should be prepared to include in our legislation a provision enlarging thepowers of the Parliament and Government of Northern Ireland to operate, in concert with the Eire Government, specified schemes extending athwart the boundary. This enlargement could not, however, be in purely general terms: itmust take the form of extending to certain specified subjects the powers conferred by section 1 of the Northern Ireland Act, 1947. Northern Ireland Ministers werecontent with this solution, and have given a provisional list of the additionalsubjects to be covered. This has been included in Clause 6 of the revised draftof the Ireland Bill. It will be noted that the subjects covered by this list include&quot;the conservation of fish&quot;; and this will provide the authority required for northern Ireland&apos;s collaboration in any joint board which the two governments may agree to establish for controlling the fisheries in the Foyle (paragraph 5 above).The list is subject to further consideration by the Northern Ireland Government.If, however, any additional subjects which they may wish to include are of similarcharacter to those covered by this provisional list, I think that the cabinet could readily agree to this kind of extension of the powers already granted bysection 1 of the Northern Ireland Act, 1947. The final details of this Clause canbe scrutinised in due course by the Legislation Committee.8. Westminster Franchise (paragraph 26 of the working party&apos;s report).-The Northern Ireland Ministers pressed strongly their suggestion that thereshould be a six months&apos; residence qualification for the exercise in Northern Irelandof the Westminster franchise. They feel very strongly that they are entitledto ask for this protection against the danger that Eire citizens will get their names on the register by paying a short visit to Northern Irelandaround the qualifying date; and they argue that if this is done on any large scale as it can without difficulty be done across a land boundary it couldfalsify the representation of Northern Ireland in the Parliament at Westminster.They are genuinely apprehensive that this may be one of the stratagems employedin furtherance of the anti-Partition campaign which the Eire Government arenow fostering.There is undoubtedly some risk in this respect and it is difficult to denyNorthern Ireland the protection for which it asks. It can be argued that condi-tions in the two countries are sufficiently different to justify a differentiationin the qualifications for voting in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland respec-tively. On the other hand, if we now re-open this question, which was decided in the opposite sense when the Representation of the People Bill was passedlast session, we shall provoke considerable controversy in the Parliament at westminster. There will, in particular, be allegations that the Northern ireland government are guilty of gerrymandering the elections for their own Parliament.36391 b 2
In our discussion with the Northern Ireland Ministers we suggested thatthey should reduce the residence qualification (at present seven years) for the franchise for their own Parliament, on the ground that our difficulties atWestminister might be eased if we were able to say, when proposing a shortresidence qualification for the exercise of the Westminster franchise in NorthernIreland, that the Northern. Ireland Government, had undertaken to reduce ,theresidence qualification for the franchise for their own Parliament. Jt would inany event be difficult, to justify a six months&apos; qualification for the Westminsterfranchise. If, however, the Northern Ireland Government are willing to authoriseus to announce that they intend to reduce to, say, three years the residencequalification for their own franchise, I suggest that we should be justified in proposing a three months&apos; residence qualification for the exercise in NorthernIreland of the franchise for the Parliament at Westminster. A. Clause providingfor such a residence qualification has been provisionally included in the revised draft of the Ireland Bill (Clause 5 in the attached draft).9. Membership of Northern Ireland Parliament (paragraph 27 of theworking party&apos;s report). I was not prepared to recommend that the NorthernIreland Parliament should be given general powers to legislate with regard to the qualification and disqualification of Members of the Senate and House of commons in Northern Ireland. It seemed to me that the Parliament at Westminster, inits capacity as trustee for the interests of minorities in Northern Ireland, should keep in its own hands the general control over this subject. From dilr discussions with the Northern Ireland Ministers, however, it emerged that they were concerned only to obtain power to legislate with regard to the disqualification of members who accept places of profit under the Crown or are concerned with government contracts. To delegate this limited power to the Northern Ireland parliament would not involve any derogation from our general responsibility for protecting the interests of minorities; and there may be less objection to giving them powers&quot;to legislate within this limited field. Since our discussion the Northern ireland government have submitted a draft clause on this subject, which has been pro-visionally included as Clause 7 in the annexed draft Bill. My colleagues will wish to consider whether a clause on these lines will be acceptable.*10. Supreme Court (paragraph 28 of the Working party&apos;s report), TheNorthern Ireland Ministers were disposed to press their suggestion that power to legislate on all matters affecting the Supreme Court should be transferred to theNorthern Ireland Parliament. They supported this on the, ground that thelaw regulating judicial procedure in Northern Ireland is in many respects out of date, and that reforms which are urgently needed could be more quickly secured inthe Northern Ireland Parliament than in the Parliament at Westminster which,,amidst its many other preoccupations, has little time for legislation of this kind.On the other hand, I am satisfied that it would be inexpedient to transfer to northern Ireland Ministers the power to appoint judges of the Supreme Courtin Northern Ireland. My impression that they would allow political cbrisidera-tions to influence their appointments has been strengthened by some of the argu-ments which they put forward in support of their request for the transfer of thisjurisdiction. We suggested in our discussion that all responsibility for theappointment of Judges and for other functions in relation to the Supreme Courtof Northern Iceland should be transferred from the Home Secretary to the LordChancellor-on the ground that the Supreme Court of Northern Ireland forms part of a single structure of judicial administration culminating in the House ofLords. At the same time we asked the Northern Ireland Government to submitspecific proposals for legislation to reform their judicial procedure generally, andwe promised that sympathetic consideration would be given to the possibility, of arranging for legislation giving effect to those proposals to be introduced in the parliament at Westminster at an early date. Such legislation could appro-appropriately be introduced in the House of Lords; The proposed provision trans-ferrihg to the Lord Chancellor the Home Secretary&apos;s existing responsibilities inthese matters could be incorporated in that legislation. There will therefore beno occasion to include in the Ireland Bill any provisions relating to the SupremeCourt in Northern Ireland.11. Financial Matters. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has held separatediscussions with the Northern Ireland Minister of Finance on the financial prb-posals discussed in paragraph 29 of the working party&apos;s report.   As a result, the
two Ministers have agreed to appoint a special working party, comprising repre-sentatives of the Treasury, the Bank of&apos; England and the Northern IrelandMinistry of Finance, to consider these proposals generally and, in particular, toexamine means for securing more effective control over local banking in NorthernIreland. It may be found that some of the measures to be adopted as a result ofthe enquiries made by this working party can be included in a Finance Bill., Inany event it is not proposed that any provisions on these questions should beincluded in the Ireland Bill.12. ^Legislation Relating to Northern Ireland. In paragraph 80 of theirreport the working party raised the question whether any of the miscellaneousproposals of the Northern Ireland Government should be included in the IrelandBill. As stated above, any proposals which may emerge from the furtherconsideration which is to be given to the financial questions and to the reform of judicial procedure in Northern Ireland must in any event be reserved for separate legislation. There will, however, be political advantage in including,in the legislation consequential upon Eire&apos;s ceasing to be a member of theCommonwealth, some provisions designed to strengthen the hands of the NorthernIreland Government; and, in view of the course taken by our discussions with northern Ireland Ministers, it will be possible to include in this legislation, notmerely the declaration regarding the territorial integrity of Northern Ireland,but also provisions dealing with the Westminster franchise, the disqualification ofmembers of the Northern Ireland Parliament and the extension of NorthernIreland&apos;s powers to conclude agreements with Eire on matters extending athwartthe boundary. Provisions on these three points have in fact been included inthe draft Bill annexed to this paper. If the Cabinet approve the specific proposals put forward in paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 above, I recommend that provisionsgiving effect to them should be included in the Ireland Bill.13. Other Recommendations of the Working Party. The foregoing paragraphs of this paper cover, with modifications, the recommendations made inparagraphs 10-11 and 14-30 of the working party&apos;s report. There remain therecommendations made in Part I, paragraphs 9, 12 and 13 and Part V of that report. These recommendations are summarised in sub-paragraphs (i)-(vi), (viii)and (xxii)-(xxviii) of the Summary of Recommendations in Part VI of the report.I invite the Cabinet to approve those recommendations.14. If the Cabinet endorse the proposals made in this paper, the immediate action to be taken will be as follows: (i) I will take His Majesty&apos;s pleasure regarding the proposed substitution of &quot; Northern Ireland &quot; for &quot; Ireland &quot; in the Royal Style and Title.(ii) Other Commonwealth Governments will then be asked, as a matter of urgency, to assent to this change in The King&apos;s title and to undertaketo promote in due course the necessary legislation in their Parliaments.(iii) While this consultation with Commonwealth Governments is proceeding,the Government of Northern Ireland will be given an opportunityto comment on the text of the draft Bill annexed to this paper; and,when their comments are available, the details of the Bill will bescrutinised by the Legislation Committee.(iv) The Eire Government should not be consulted on the text of the Bill,but its general terms might be explained to them a few days before its introduction.(v) The Ireland Bill should not be introduced until it is known that all commonwealth Governments concur in the proposed change of TheKing&apos;s title. Subject to this, however, the Bill should be introducedsoon after Parliament re-assembles and, if possible, before the dateof commencement of the Republic of Ireland Act. The Eire Govern-ment had intended to bring their Act into operation on 21st January,1949; and they could now be informed that the United KingdomGovernment do not desire to suggest that its commencement shouldbe postponed beyond that date.C.
