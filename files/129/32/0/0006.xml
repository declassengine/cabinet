THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1949PROCEDURE FOR ORDERING CIVIL AIRCRAFT FOR THE AIRWAYSCORPORATIONSMemorandum by the Prime Minister ,FOLLOWING the report of the, Hanbury-Williams Committee, the Cabineton 29th July, 1948 (CM. (48) 55th Conclusions, Minute 2) and the socialisation of Industries Committee on 14th December, 1948 (S.I. (M) (48) 14th Meeting,Minute 5) had under review the procedure for the ordering of civil aircraft for the &quot;Airyraja. Corporations. In order tp. implement the decisions which havebfeen reached, I have instructed the Minister of Supply and the Minister of CivilAviation to put into effect the following arrangements which are in substitution for those outlined in paragraph. 3 of my note of 11th September, 1946(CP. (46) 344). &apos;*        ,2. : The Airways Corporations will ift the ordinary course of events keepwiderconstant revriew^the composition of their fleets of aircraft in the lightof their commercial, operational and engineering requirements. In view of thetime taken to produce new types of aircraft they must plan their fleets for seventoten years ahead. &apos;The. representatives of each Corporations on the Aircraft Requicements and contracts Committee (a joint agency of the thjree Corporations) will be in close touch with their: own possible requirements and those of the other.: Cpz^fytipaPiand will keep both their own Corporations and the Committee informed as tothe position. - ,&apos; Irt the future the main fleet of each Corporation is likely to consist of notmore than two or three types of standardisedaircraft in order to seeure economicaloperation. These aircraft should normally have a Tife of fi^e to seven, yearsr inview/iof all] the heavy first costs incidental to the introduction of a new type:Hence the number of new aircraft actually in production at any time will oeSmall, but there, will be frequent discussions of possible projects in which therepresentatives on the Aircraft Requirements and Contracts Committee will be associated./&apos;-.. &apos; &apos; &apos;    &apos;. - 3i As soon as a definite need&apos; for a new^ aircraft emerges the: aircraft requirements; and Contracts Committee, will receive frjOni individual Oorporja-tions their commercial and operational requirements in terms of. traffic to be handled], routes, frequencies and expected competition. They will formulate inconsultation with the officials of the Corporation concerned broad aircraft require-ments to meet these needs in the light of the accumulated prac.ti.Gal experienceof the Corporations, especially in its engineering&apos; aspectsconsulting, specialistsin the Ministries and outside as necessary. The pbsslBfe heeds Of all the corporations will be given full consideration at this stage to ensure that theaircraft likely to emerge will have a maximum usefulness to all.4. If the project looks promising the Committee will have informal discus-sions with the Ministry of Supply on its technical, aspects, and the Corporationswill discuss with the Ministry of Civil Aviation its bearing on routes, frequencies,competitive requirements and aerodromes, and its effect on the annual andtriennial programmes and estimates of the Corporations. In these preliminary discussions with the Ministry of Civil Aviation, the Chairman of the Committeeand the relevant members will take part.36403Secret!I0t,k Jfammry, 1949CABINETCopy No.
25. When the project assumes the shape of a definite requirement, detailed discussions will follow with both Ministries pn the following lines: (a) A Project Party will be formed consisting of representatives of the corporations and of both Ministries to discuss and agree the implications-tions of the requirements as regards research, design and development and the practicability of its realisation. The Project Party! willfinally settle the outline requirement.(b) This requirement will then be put to the Interdepartmental civil aircraft Requirements Committee (at one time known as the SelfCommittee) for approval, the Aircraft Requirements and[ContractsUommittee being present at the meetings. The constitution of the interdepartmental Civil Aircraft Requirements Committee shouldbe modified to permit representation on that Committee of the aircraft requirements and Contracts Committee.(c) After approval by the Interdepartmental Civil Aircraft requirements committee, the Ministry of Supply, in consultation with;,the&apos; aircraft requirements and Contracts Committee, will invite all firms withavailable design capacity to submit design tenders, together with anestimate of costs.(d) When the design tenders have been received, the Project Party will assess the merits of the designs submitted and they will recommend to theAircraft Requirements and Contracts Committee their selection. Atthis stage the chairmanship of the Project Party will be taken bythe Ministry of Supply.(e) The Corporations will then be responsible for deciding on the design tobe adopted, subject to the Research and Development Programme,Com^mittee of the Ministry of Supply deciding where capacity is to be madeavailable. :(/) The Project Party will decide whether a prototype order, to be placed by the Ministry of Supply, is necessary. Should the Project Partyfail to agree, the procedure of reference to Ministers and appeal tothe Civil Aviation Committee, set out in paragraph 6, will come intoforce. &apos; 16. The Corporations will place their own orders for production aircraft,1provided that the stage at which orders for production aircraft should: be soplaced is first agreed with the Ministry of Supply- through&apos; the Project Party.(The possibility is not excluded of a production order being placed at an;earlier stage by the Ministry of Supply as agent of a Corporation, but only with theconsent of that Corporation.) If the Project Party fails to agree, the question as to the stage at which the Corporations should place the order would be referredto the Ministers of Supply and Civil Aviation to consult together and, if theyshould fail to agree, to the Civil Aviation Committee, for decision, the Corpora-tions being allowed to state their own case if Ministers agreed that they should do so.7. Except in the special case provided for in the second sentence (In brackets) of paragraph 6 above, at the stage agreed by the Project Party (orby the Ministers or the Civil Aviation Committee under paragraph 6) the aircraft requirements and Contracts Committee will negotiate the production contracton behalf of the Corporations with the firm selected and will administer the contract when placed.C.
