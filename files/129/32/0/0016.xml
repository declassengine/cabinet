These detailed estimates were to be scrutinised by the Ministry of defence and the Treasury, in collaboration with the Service Departments, with a view to seeing what further reductions could be effected without interfering withessential services. ..3. The Service Departments prepared detailed estimates on this basis, andthe Ministries of Supply and Defence submitted revised estimates of  58 million and  0-712 million. Each of the Service estimates has now been scrutinised by officials of the Treasury, the Ministry of Defence and the Service department concerned. The series of heavy reductions already made to reach the figures stated above make it extremely difficult to impose further cuts unless there are to becorresponding cuts in our commitments. Any further cut must increase the risks which we are taking and the likelihood that supplementary estimates will benecessary later in the year. To endeavour to meet the Chancellors wishes to come degree I am willing to recommend reductions totalling approximately  5 - 3 million in the departmental estimates, which would reduce the previous over-all estimatefrom  763 million to  757-7 million. To this, however, must be added  2-3 million for the Berlin airlift, which brings the total up to  760 million. the revised details are as follows :  millionAdmiraltyWar office air Ministry   ...Berlin airlift   ...Ministry of supply ministry of Defence189-25304-70205-102-3558 000-71760-11These figures have been very closely estimated although there may have to be a.few minor adjustments. The First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary ofState for Air have accepted these proposals, but the Secretary of State for Wardesires to reserve his position.4. These figures are less than those originally asked for on the basis ofmaintaining the full emergency programme and achieving the desirable man-power strengths. They represent a substantial reduction of the programmes forthe modernisation and conversion of ships, and of the purchase of vehicles andother equipment required to increase the Army&apos;s preparedness for war. many other measures complementary to the emergency measures-specifically approvedwill have to be abandoned. It will not, however, be necessary to revoke theGovernment&apos;s decisions of last summer, although the tempo in many instanceswill have to be reduced. The works programmes will have to be slowed down, andwe shall have to be content with smaller instalments towards our long-term plans for improving the living conditions of the Forces. Details of the proposed expen-diture will be shown in the Defence White Paper which I propose to submit forthe Cabinet&apos;s approval at an early date.,, 5. The purpose of the present paper is to invite the concurrence of theCabinet in the net total for the Defence Budget, 1949-50, proposed in paragraph above.A. V. A.Ministry of Defence, S.W. 1,20th January, 1949.
;    . . , ANNEX &quot;. .;[DO. (48) 83]I. ExplanatoryFor some months past I have been examining with my Service colleagues and the Chiefs of Staff the Defence requirements for 1949-50 in terms of menand money. . :12. A year ago I sought and obtained acceptance of a Defence Budget of 892-6 million for 1948-49. The man-power strengths set out in the 1948Defence White Paper were as follows:-1.4.48   , 31.3.49Navy      ...      ........ 145,000 145,000Army      ...      ...      ...      ... 534,000 345,000Air Force ...      .......261,000 226,000Total ...      ...      ... 940,000 716,000 .3. When I put forward to the Cabinet in January, 1948, (CP. (48) 2)my proposals for 1948-49, I emphasised that it had been necessary to takevery considerable risks, and that I was bound to warn my colleagues that, shouldthese mature against us, or should we be faced with additional commitments which had npt been taken into account in preparing the estimates, I should be compelled to seek authority for reasonable Supplementary Estimates. At thesame time the Cabinet had before them the report of the Joint War production staff, which pointed out that there could not be indefinite delay in the modernisa-tion of our armed forces; and that, since the programmes then submitted assumed the extensive use of obsolescent equipment, future programmes must containincreased provision for the production of equipment. i4. In the event, the position has deteriorated. Our Forces have not beenable to be withdrawn from Austria, Trieste and Greece, and I have recentlybeen forced, after consultation with the Foreign Office, to agree that plans should proceed on the basis of our Forces remaining in Austria and Trieste up to31st March, 1950. Our commitments in Greece are also likely to continue through-out the year. We have, moreover, had an unforeseen and continuing commitment in Malaya. In addition, previous strategic decisions and plans had assumed thatthere would be no major threat of war before 1957. The Berlin crisis and the rapid deterioration in international relations have made it imperative that plans should envisage such a threat in the near future. The position was speciallyreviewed last summer and, at their meeting on 26th August (CM. (48) 57thConclusions, Minute 2), the Cabinet approved a number of emergency measures designed (a) to remedy some of the most serious deficiencies in equipment, and(6) temporarily to stabilise the strength of the Forces. These decisions&apos;furtherupset the plans made a year ago for 1948-49. &quot; :: -        .!,5. As a result of the deferment of releases by three months, the strengths of the Services at 31st March, 1949, will considerably exceed those approved a year ago. Strengths as originally planned and as now estimated for 31st March,1949, are as follows : As planneda year agoNavy      ............. 145,000Army     ............ 345,600 VAir Force ...      ...      ... 226,000Total ...      ....... 716,000 791,0006. It is as yet early for,the.Service Departments to estimate the probableactual out-turn of this year&apos;s Votes, particuiarly in view of the difficulty of estimating the expenditure which will result this year from the emergency measures of last summer.As now estimated&apos;,y&apos;- ; 145,000v  412,000234,00036464
Provisional figures are as follows:  &quot; &apos;.&apos;  millionAdmiralty       ...............      - - - ^9&apos;   &apos;      War Office &apos; (excluding special terminals in India       &apos;and Persia)       ......      -\        - ianAir Ministry   ...............       ;- THO&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; Ministries of Supply and Defence ...      ...------- 730This represents an increase of over  35 million on the Estimate provision.II.- 1949-50 Defence Requirements7. In 1949-50 the Services will unfortunately still be charged with responsi-bilities of which we had hoped that they would be relieved. It is true that expenditure on terminal charges will be less, but they can no longer continue to depend to the same extent as hitherto on war-time stocks for their current needsof equipment and stores, which in 1949-50 must be met from fresh production..This will involve a considerable increase in inescapable expenditure. Even whereit is still possible to rely on such stocks, as in the case of vehicles, a very expensiveoverhaul and repair programme is unavoidable, and it has also been essentialto arrange for new production of spares on a large scale, e.g., to avoid the speedydissipation of vehicle assets. The programme for transport vehicles of the three services is estimated to cost nearly  17 million in 1949-50, of which; more thana half will be for spares alone. For all these reasons the requirements of theServices in both men and money will be greater in 1949-50 than I would have wished.  &quot; &apos;. ...  -8.   I obtained reports from the Service Departments of their requirements, for 1949-50 in the light of present circumstances.  These reports assumed averageman-power strengths for next year as follows :-Average.Navy ...      ..... ......      146,000Army...      ...      ............      434,000Air Force ....... ...      237,000Total ...      ...      ......-   ...    &apos; 817,000The total Defence Budget was estimated to be about  83 million. The chancellor had, indeed, indicated to me that the economy of the country could hot sustain a defence Budget of more than  700 million plus the provision of about  12 million for the pay increase announced on 24th November.9. I therefore requested the Service Departments to revise their plans andto state the effect of accepting a total Defence Budget of  700 million. I indicated that, after making provision for pay increases and for Ministry of Supply and ministry of Defence expenditure, there would remain some  627 million, whichI suggested should provisionally be allocated :   millionAdmiralty (including  2 million for terminals and;  12 million for research and development)......      177War Office (including  9 million for terminals)......      270Air Ministry (including  4 million for terminals)  ....      180, 10. Navy-The Admiralty pointed out that they had already reduced their strength to 145,000 before the beginning of this year, and that there never hadbeen any intention that it should fall below this figure. No saving could thereforebe expected from cuts in man-power. The approved Navy programme hadenvisaged an expenditure of  160 million for the current year. A special shadowout of  7 million was applied on the understanding that a supplementary estimateup to that amount would be allowed if the programme progressed at such a rate as to show that the money would be required, as indeed it will be. In 1949-50they would have to spend  5 million on emergency measures already in handand a further  19 million on account of higher prices, higher civilian wages,
increased non-effective charges, maintenance, production in respect of items inregard to which wartime surpluses no longer existed, increased expenditure onworks : this figure also allowed for a fall in receipts. In addition, they wouldhave to provide for the sanctioned stockpiling of oil fuel (an approved programme for which had, it will be remembered, suffered a serious set-back by the help whichthe Admiralty was called upon to make to civilian needs a year ago) and for essential refits on Reserve Fleet ships. If, therefore, the Admiralty were held to 177 million they would be forced (i) To abandon all further measures, both long and short term, designed toI         - improve the Navy&apos;s state of readiness, and, indeed, to cancel somesimilar measures already in hand;(ii) to abandon all improvements to machinery and equipment ashore andafloat;(iii) to abandon measures designed to remedy the most serious deficiencies inpresent stocks of naval ammunition;(iv) to reduce the already inadequate provision for works (as described above); and(v) as a last resort, to reduce the man-power strength.The cumulative effect would be that the state of material readiness of the navy would go back practically to the level at which it stood before the emergency oflast summer, and if (v) proved to be necessary some immobilisation of ships nowin commission would be inevitable.11. Army. The. War Office pointed out that to get down to a net total of 270 million they would have to abandon entirely the emergency production pro-gramme approved by the Cabinet last summer and, in addition, assume an averagestrength of only 327,000 men. As they would start the year with about 412,000,this average could be attained only by reaching a strength of some 242,000 by 1st April, 1950. But by that date they expected to have about 192,000 regulars(men) and some 16,000 women and boys. They could therefore have only about34,000 national servicemen. Most of these 34,000 would be men called up late in1948 and whose period of service of at least 18 months would not have expired by 1st April, 1950. There could, therefore, be a mere token intake of national service-men in 1949. Moreover, such a sudden and extensive rundown would involve earlywithdrawal from present overseas commitments for which the necessary forces could iiot be provided. If, on the other hand, the strength had to be maintained,it would be necessary to make a very large reduction in production and works.But men without stores and equipment would be useless and the works programme is already inadequate, as was stressed so forcibly in the Debate in the House ofCommons on 1st December.12. Air Force. The Air Ministry pointed Out that to effect their savingsthey would have to abandon entirely their emergency production programme,including the much-needed provision for extra jet aircraft; to cut substantiallytheir works programme; to reduce their average man-power strength by some45,000, and to make other substantial reductions over the Vote as a whole, a cut of about 45,000 in the average strength would lead to a strength at 1st April,1950, of about 150,000, of whom about 142,000 would be regulars. Most of thebalance of 8,000 national servicemen would have been called up in 1948, so that only a token intake would be possible in 1949.13. General. Drastic reductions in Army and Air Force man-power Ofthe magnitude indicated above would produce chaotic conditions from whichthese Services could not recover for many years. They would not be able to fulfil the conuhitments which His Majesty&apos;s Government has placed upon them.Further, these, reductions would only permit such a token intake of national servicemen in&apos; 1949 that the whole national service scheme would be stultified.Moreover, in the field of equipment the economies envisaged&apos; would \iny$ye notonly the complete and public repudiation of the emergency production measures announced last summer, but also some curtailment of the normal maintenanceproduction programme for all three Services. For these reasons I am fullyconvinced that a Defence Budget of  700&apos; million even with the addition, assubsequently agreed by the Chancellor, of some  12 million for , recent pay increases, is. quite inadequate to support effective Armed Forces.
Revised Proposals14.   After discussion, my Service colleagues further reviewed the provision to be made in 1949-50. They submitted revised average strengths for 1949-50as follows :--    Navy ...      ...      ... ...      145,000Army............      ...      398,000:   R.A.F.............      ...      228,000Total       ..........      ...      771,000With these average strengths the strengths as at 1st April, 1950, would beabout as follows : Navy ..............,      145,000Army...............      386,000R.A.F..............      ...      213,000Total.........      744,000The figure of 745,000 would be some 75,000 below the figure of requirementsgiven in the initial appreciation by the Chiefs of Staff.15. They informed me that, with the above reduction in strength and bya drastic limitation, if not complete exclusion, of new projects and by a curtail-ment of already approved programmes, but allowing for pay increases, they could reduce their next year&apos;s Estimates to :  MillionNavy (including  11 million for Research and Develop-:      ment) ..........      ...      ...      ...      196&apos; -   Army........................      315RAF..............    ..........  ,  ...      208With an allowance of  61 million for the Ministries of Supply and Defence,this would give a Defence Budget of  780 million. It may be possible, as a resultof further detailed scrutiny, to effect an overall reduction of some  5 million to 10 million, giving a Defence Budget of a little over  770 million.16.   If we are to remedy some of the most striking deficiencies in our Defencesit is clear that no smaller total provision than  770 million will suffice.   To gobelow that figure would have serious consequences on our ability, should the needarise, to fight with what we have got.   The task which each Service has to per-form, both in the immediate future and iii a major war, has been most carefullyreviewed.   It is not possible to place the major share of any economies on one service&apos; either in present circumstances or in view of the role of each in thesupport1 of the three main continuing pillars of our overall strategy, viz., defenceof the United Kingdom, maintenance of sea communications, and Middle: east defence.   If drastic cuts were imposed they would have to fall mainly on pro-ductiort and works and I must remind my colleagues of the importance which hasbeen attached by members of all Parties in recent Debates to the essential need.pf ensuring that our Armed Forces have both the equipment which is vital if theyare to be able to function effectively and to be properly housed.  To secure a sub-i stantial. reduction below  770 million would involve a slowing down, if noti cancellation, of many of ithe &apos;mesu:presrin, t^e&apos; emergency programme which only as recently as last September we informed the House rif Commons that we had[accepted as ^essential for the well-being of our: Forces.  Some retardation may bepossible, but complete cancellation is, in wy: view, out of the question.   Moreover,, there, is no more certain way of wasting money than to start a programme and then.xp^as,tie^liy:; curtail, it just as it,is getting - into itsI stride!    Indeed^ the&apos; actual^saving, is in some,.respects,,problematical, becajhse instead of paying &amp;c for the delivery of needed.stores;and,eqmpmerVt one. pays, a!considerable part of such asum for,. half -completed, ,and in such form useless, ltemsj ahd&quot;&apos;f or cancelled^contracts,     j &apos; . ,       ,        * r ,*    &apos; ,/&apos;   &apos;*   . -
17. I have, however, considered the effect on our Defences of a defence budget of  750 million which would have to be divided, approximately asfollows:--       -    - - !V      &apos; ..  million    iAdmiralty (including Research and Development)    about 190War Office   ...      ...      ............    about 300Air Ministry ...&quot;.........      ...    about 200Ministry of Supply.......      ......      ...    about   56Ministry of Defence ...      ...      ... about    118.. With a Budget of  770 million the Admiralty would have to eliminateall provision for the first instalment of the plan to prepare the Navy for a majorthreat of war by 1957 and the other two Services would also be unable to make provision for long-term re-equipment. A reduction to about  750 million would affect the three Services in the following ways : 19. Navy. The Admiralty would have to abandon or curtail the followingvital measures: (1) Provision of anti-submarine and anti-aircraft weapons and ammunition,.radio and radar equipment, in replacement of obsolescent andunserviceable items;  and the replacement of over-age submarinebatteries.(2) The replacement of obsolete aircraft and aircraft stores.(3) The provision of boom defence equipment and degaussing material for merchant ships.(4) Stock-piling of oil fuel. ;!;     &quot;&quot;(5) Refitting of Reserve Fleet ships at present rate (which would involve further serious deterioration in their condition).20. A rmy. The War Office would have to abandon at least two-thirds of theemergency programme, retaining only some increased production of anti-aircraftammunition and tanks. They would be forced further to reduce the number of civilians on aftermath of war tasks and to effect a reduction of some thousandsin uniformed man-power. &apos; -21.   R.A.F. The Air Ministry would have to take the following steps :;(1) Cancel double-shift working on production of jet fighters.(2) Defer production of other aircraft.(3) Defer production of some ammunition. &apos;     ij(4^ Reduce provision for stocking of petrol, oil and lubricants.&apos;     ; 1    1(5) Cancel the provision of clothing for reservists On mobilisation;(6) Reduce the provision for works services; and(7) Reduce the civilian strength in Maintenance Command. -The broad effects would be to abandon the measures already in hand to remedy the worst deficiencies in our air strength and to defer expenditure until1950-51. ;   f22. In reaching a decision as to the 1949-50 Defence Budget it is necessaryto take into account:- *   ; ;   .(i) the need to meet more normal maintenance from fresh production aswartime surpluses have now largely been consumed; -1 1 !:;(ii) the need to balance the stocks of the most important items and avoid a relapse to the state of unpreparedness which existed at the time ofthe emergency last.summer;&apos; 111,11(iii) the need to effect some stock-piling,e.^V, of P.O.L. as1 already aMfor the Navy and Air ^ &quot;     &quot;(iv) the need for adequate Works provision to allow for re-deploymeritof our Forces, particularly in the Middle East, for the maintenance and extension of airfields and for the improvement of bad housing conditions which are impeding recruitment of regulars;      vi^viiob(v) the increases to be borne hy all Services on account of higher prices;higher wages, particularly in the case of industrial staffs; extra
non-effective charges; increases in Service pay; and increased pro-vision for National Insurance. There are other miscellaneousinescapable increases but those mentioned account for an additional expenditure of nearly  35 million;(vi) the need to make some additional provision for research anddevelopment.Recommendations23.   I invite my colleagues (i) to agree that it is not possible to reduce the Defence Budget to 712 million as this provision would compel us to abandon manypresent commitments; to reduce the Forces to an extent which wouldmake them ineffective and permit of a mere token intake of national servicemen in 1949; and to deny them the equipment which is essential if they are to be effective;(ii) to approve, for submission to the Cabinet, a Defence Budget for 1949-50of  770 million, of which the precise distribution will be further considered by myself, my colleagues in the three Service departments and the Minister of Supply.&apos;   .
