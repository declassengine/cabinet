this document is the property of hib britannic majesty&apos;8 governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.  January 1949SECRET Copy No. 31CP. (49) 2Uh January, 1949CABINETCENSUS OF DISTRIBUTIONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster i have thought further about this question since the Cabinet discussed iton 22nd December last (CM. (48) 82nd Conclusions, Minute 4) and feel even moresure than before that it would be a serious political blunder to hold a Census of distribution in 1950.2. I have studied the proposed form attached to CP. (49) 1 for the smallerretailers, and I have no doubt that completion of this form would present real difficulty to many small shopkeepers, particularly questions 6, 7, 8 and 10. our political opponents will certainly lose no opportunity of magnifying these diffi-culties. Many small shopkeepers especially village shopkeepers are part ofthe floating vote, and their shops are significant social centres of gossip andpolitical discussion.3. The proposed timetable could hardly be more disadvantageous from anelectioneering point of view. Forms would be issued to traders early in January1950, reminder letters in April, while prosecutions for failure to complete forms no doubt with earlier warnings would begin in July. I do not think that thesuggestion that traders should be given a slightly longer period in. which tocomplete returns, ie., until May or June, would much improve things.4. There would, of course, be some political embarrassment in going backnow on Drevious decisions and announcements, including the Census of Distri-bution (1950) Order, 1948 (S.I. 1948 No. 2176), made in September last, andpostponing the Census. But this change in plans would be soon forgotten andanyhow would be much less embarrassing in my view than holding the Censusnext year.5. I fully recognise the desirability of having regular information aboutwholesale and retail distribution. Indeed, I was myself responsible, as Presidentof the Board of Trade, for the various steps taken in appointing the Census of distribution Committee, short of the actual signature of the minute of appoint-ment on 12th June, 1945, soon after the Caretaker Government had taken over.But, having waited so long, I do not think that even two years&apos; further delay in the holding of this first Census would be a very serious matter.6. The holding of a Census of Distribution in 1950 would not, of course,help us to frame a policy on distribution for our General Election programme.But that does not mean that we can have no policy. We shall, I hope, be able toinclude in our programme proposals, particularly in the important field of food distribution, which should be both practical and popular.7. I hope, therefore, that my colleagues will agree to postpone this Censusuntil after the Election.H. D.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,6th January, 1949.36387
