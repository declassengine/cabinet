S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAHDTIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERMMENT)SECRETCP. (49) 37TH JAHUARY.  19U9CABINETEUROPEAN UNITYMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign affairs as my colleagues are aware, the Committee on european unity considered, a report by its Sub-Committee before Christmasand decided to consult the Governments concerned before resumingits labours on 5th January.      I myself examined the Sub-Committee &apos;s report during the Christmas recess, but in orderto give it more thorough consideration and to have time toprepare a paper for circulation to my colleagues,  I asked fora short postponement of the final session of the Committee.This delay may be of additional value since Monsieur Schumanis due to arrive in London for a short visit on Thursday, 13thJanuary, and it would be highly desirable if possible to arriveat -some general agreement with him before the Committee producesits final report.      The report would then have to be taken bythe Consultative Council at its next meeting in London on26th January.2. I attach at Appendix A a copy of the report of the Sub-Coiiimittee of the Committee on European Unity.     As the reportstates &quot;while reserving to each of the Governments concerned thefinal decisions on the principles of the problems studied, theSub-Committee has sought to find common ground between thedifferent plans before it. !&apos;3. In any case,^having reflected on the subject, I donot myself like the Sub-Committee&apos;s plan.      I think,  in fact,that even though the agenda of the proposed consultative assembly might be largely controlled by the proposed Councilof Ministers, the possibility of individual voting might giverise to all kinds of &quot;undesirable complications and even resultin the Assembly being used as a stick with which :ipublicopinion&quot; - in other words, to a large extent, the variousOppositions - might belabour the various Governments of theday.      Indeed I do not much like any plan which would resultin the larger body meeting in public &quot;(whatever it may be called)being even to a limited degree independent of a smaller bodymeeting in private and truly representative of the various governments.      Consequently, my own inclination is to emphasise the unity of the whole concept and to arrive at a system whereby the larger body meeting in public is, as it were, an emanationof the smaller body meeting in private.      I attach at appendix B a tentative scheme designed to put this general principle into operation.      My colleagues will see that one ortwo points are put in alternative form and it is not necessaryfor me to elaborate    here what the differences between these various alternatives are, as they are self-evident.COPY WO. O

ij.. There are, however, three major points to which Iwould like briefly to allude, as follows.MembershipIt would be the intention, of course, that germany should be associated with the Council of Europe at a fairlyearly date.      If, indeed, the Council of Europe is not estab-. lished until some Western German Government is in the saddleand functioning properly, Germany might even become a PounderMember.      If the Council is set up before this it might bepossible to bring in officials from the Allied Military Govern-ment, representing the various zones, as observers, accompaniedno doubt by Germans.     This point, however, could be examinednearer the time, and in any case it may be necessary to providefor some limitation on the discussion of matters connected withthe Occupation Statute if,the German Government is admitted tothe Council of Europe with full rights in all other respects.It would also be the intention, provided agreement is forth-coming at the next Consultative Council meeting, to inviteItaly, the four Scandinavian States, Eire and possiblyPortugal, Switzerland and Austria as well, to a Conference atwhich the final form of the Council of Europe could bedetermined.      This might give rise to protests from Greece and turkey, but here again we should,-I feel, face that particular problem when it arises.Simplification of existing agenciesIf the Atlantic Pact is signed it is evident thatthe military organisation established under the Brussels Treaty -and indeed for practical purposes the military obligations ofthe Brussels Treaty - will, if they do not actually lapse, be merged in a greater whole.      The social, cultural and to someextent the economic side of the Treaty of Brussels will, how-ever remain;    and it might of course be possible to arrange forother European countries, such as Italy and the scandinavian countries, to accede to that part of the Treaty of Brusselsonly.      If, however, some Council of Europe is to be estab-lished, it would seem far simpler to arrange for the social,cultural and economic work now proceeding within the framework of Brussels to be transferred to the Council of EuropeSecretariat, which might well be increased and suitablepublicity arrangements made.      This should be all the easiersince the Council of Europe would, after all, meet in public and, it is to be hoped, have a considerable popular appeal.     Weshould thus eventually get tv/o main organisations (1) defence,centring round London and Washington, and (2) social, culturaland economic, centring round the headquarters of the Council ofEurope and designed, along with 0. E. E. C. , to lay the foundationsfor greater European unity.      It seems evident, too, that whenE.R. P.  comes to an end in 1952 (if indeed it does not end before then) some fusion should be effected between the 0, E. E. C.  andthe Council of Europe machines.      This ma.y well be in accordance  .with the general trend of world events consequent upon theestablishment of any Planning or New Deal system in the UnitedStates.NumbersIt will be seen that in Alternative B in Section 11(a)of my &quot;Draft Heads of agreement&quot; I have provided for equal numbers for the United Kingdom and Prance and for slightly fewer numbers for Italy and Germany.      The position is that the French wouldbe extremely relu.ctant to accept smaller representation thank-0 million people in Prance as compared with about h-6 million in Western Germany, 1+6 million in Italy and 50 million in the

United Kingdom.      However, by adding to the French-figures thepopulation of Algeria, which is, after all, part of the Metro-politan territory of France and very close to Europe, the Frenchfigures could he pushed on to 5.0 million, which would give thernequal representation to ourselves and more than Western Germanyand Italy.      I&apos; think this v/ould-Jie equitable in all the circum-stances, and at any rate wourldgiveXsatisfaction to the French.If the Scandinavian States.\IrelandJand Portugal join thegroup, suitable figures for Sfeeffl-etfuld be worked out, not basedentirely on population figures but also on the intrinsic import-ance of the States concerned.5. In conclusion I^ptLToPbYily say that, having launchedthe idea of Western Union^rayselfjhearly a year ago, and beingunder very great pressure Tre^h^Trom the Continental Democraciesof Western Europe and from the United States to achieve some further stage in the direction of European Unity, I am con-vinced that we must now take a new forv/ard step and at anyrate agree to something which could be called a Council ofEurope, the meetings of which will be held in public.      That,as I see it, is the essential point with which I feel mycolleagues will be in agreement, and it is for them to say whether in all the circumstances the alternative plan which put forward at Appendix B is broadly speaking sufficient tomeet the demand which has been created, and at the same timeto provide-the necessary safeguards,6. I would also emphasise that all that I am actuallyseeking now is authority to instruct the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster to put forward the scheme at Appendix B,with any modifications on which the Cabinet may agree, when theCommittee on European Unity reassembles in Paris, possibly on1&apos;7th January.      If he should do this, it seems likely that theCommittee would present a divided Report which could then be sub-mitted to the various Governments before the consultative council meets^jn 26th January.      In the light of subsequentdevelopments 1 should then propose to consult my colleaguesagain, and clearly I could not enter into any real commitmentsat the Consultative Council without further Cabinet authority.Indeed, it does not seem likely that any final commitments needoe entered into until such time as the Conference referred toin paragraph h above, meets to decide on the final shape of the -Council of Europe.E.

The French Delegation considers- that there is urgent and vital need for a close union among all the peoples ofEurope.The difficulties of achieving such a union cannot be overcome without understanding and support from, public opinion in the various European countries.      For this reason itappears indispensable that a European Assembly should be convened.      When such an Assembly has been set up,  one important step will have been taken, from the political pointof view., along the road to unity.      This Assembly will be a consultative one.      It should, have as representative a .character as possible and should possess due freedom &apos;of .expression.1.     The Assembly will be composed of delegates appointedby thu various European parliaments according to the method ofnomination appropriate to each of these parliaments.      Thenumber of delegates should not be unduly large and should befixed in such a way that none of the countries with the greater-populations can have more than JLj.0.      The term of office of delegates to the Assembly will end at the same time as the life of the nominating parliament      The European Consultative Assembly will meet twice ayear for sessions of a fortnight each..      It will be empoweredto establish standing Committees to meet during the period between the sessionsDebates in the Assembly will be public and it will take steps to arrange for their publication.3,    The subjects for debate in the Assembly will be proposed by Governments       The Assembly will   however, beentitled to place on its agenda any other matter.      Theresults of its labours,  set forth in the form of resolutions adopted by majority vote; will be transmitted to theGovernments whose business it will be to take decisions.U-    It appears desirable that,, once the EuropeanConsultative Assembly has been set up in this way, theGovernments should establish a Council to meet at regular intervals or whenever circumstances may require,  either toprepare the business of the Assembly or to take any other decisions.5,    It is desirable that the Assembly,  in its final form,should bring together representatives of all the nations ofEurope       To begin with,  it should include any Power whoseparticipation in its work may be deemed immediately desirable,for example    ItalyMEMORANDUM PROM THE FRENCH DELEGATION ON THE plan for A EUROPEAN CONSULTATIVE ASSEMBLY(Translation) V

ANNEX IVMEMORANDUM OP THE BRITISH PROPOSAL FORA COUNCIL OP EUROPE.It is common ground that through the various organsestablished by the Brussels Treaty Powers great progress hasbeen made in the direction of effective Western european co-operation.      What appears to be necessary now is tocomplete this framework.      To this end, the United kingdom delegation proposes the formation of a new body, to becalled the &quot;Council of Europe&quot;.; on the following basis:(a) This Council of Europe would be established inthe first instance- for a period of five years and would meet at stated intervals for the discussion of all mattersof common concern.(b) The Powers represented in the initial stage would be the five Brussels Powers.      Eventually,  the council might be extended to. comprise delegations from other states members of 0.E.E.C.      At a comparatively early stage,  italy might be included..      Later, subject to necessary safeguards.,it might be thought appropriate to include Western Germany.(c) The States would be represented in the Council ofEurope by delegations appointed by the Governments&apos; and headed by Ministers       These Delegations would be composed on linessimilar to national delegations to the United Nations or tothe old League of Nations Assembly    i. e.   they might includepolitical figures outside the government and other persons with special qualifications.(d).   The Council of Europe would be served by a strongpermanent international secretariat It would operate witha minimum of formality and rigid procedure       Decisions wouldbe taken by agreement and not by a majority vote.(e) Defence matters are now the responsibility of the brussels powers and may later be covered by the projectedAtlantic Pact. &apos;      Economic matters will be mainly the&apos;responsibility of 0.E.S.C.  until 1952.(f) Each government represented in the Council ofEurope would report to its own parliament.      This would afford opportunity for the full expression of public opinion in each country.In framing these proposals, the United Kingdom Delegationhave been influenced by the following considerations.      Whatis most needed at the present time is to set up an organisation which would enable the governments of western europe to work together more effectively.      The UnitedKingdom Delegation consider that the energies of western europe should be directed to this end and that it would be unrealistic and impracticable to attempt to give executiveor legislative power to any non-governmental body.This proposal also has the merit of simplicity.      Onthe one hand,  it leaves open the possibility of associatingwith the Council of Europe overseas.  countries having specialrelations with member governments       On the other hand itavoids the difficulties which might arise through differences of constitutional procedure

National delegationsshould be led by a Minister.      The numbers of national delega-tions might vary.     A possible scheme would be:-Alternative A        &apos;        sUnited Kingdom	8Prance	8Italy	8Germany	8Holland	3Belgium	3Luxemburg	2Alternative B	United Kingdom	25Prance	25Italy	23Germany	23Holland	8Belgium	8Luxemburg	2(b)   The Committee of Ministers would consist of thePrime Ministers, or the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, or theirDeputies, of the participating countries.III. Functions(a)   The Conference would be empowered to discuss any matter of common concern to the Member countries placed before it by the Committee of Ministers.      In particular, it would bethe intention that the Conference should examine all possible&apos;and practical means of ensuring a greater measure of unityamong the participating countries.      No recommendation of theConference would be in any way binding on Governments.      the meetings of the Conference would normally be held in public.h Alternative A would be on the assumption of one delegationone vote: Alternative B on assumption that proportionate&apos;voting would-be accepted - see V(a).

0 411(b)   The Committee of Ministers would discuss any matterof common concern brought before it by any Member v/ith theexception of questions relating to defence.

Frequency of Meetings(a) The Conference would hold one or more ordinarysessions a year, the date and duration of which would bedetermined by it with due regard to the Parliamentary situationin the various countries concerned.      In no case, however, shouldthe ordinary session or sessions exceed three weeks in all.Extraordinary sessions could be held with the consent of or atthe instance of the Committee of Ministers.(b) The Committee of Ministers would meet shortly beforethe Conference in order to prepare the Conference agenda.      Itcould also meet during or after the session of the Conferenceat any time that might seem to be desirable.V. Procedure(a) Alternative AEach Delegation to the Conference would have onevote.alternative BVoting in the Conference would be by nationaldelegations in proportion to their sise, votes being cast bythe Heads of Delegations.Decisions of the Conference on matters of substancewould be taken by a two-thirds and on matters of procedure bya simple majority.(b) In the Committee of Ministers decisions would normally be taken by common consent.      As an exception,decisions to refer any matter to the Conference for discussions would, however, be taken by a two-thirds majority, and decisions on matters of procedure woulds if necessary, be taken by a simple majority.(c) Both the Conference and the Committee of ministers would have the right to constitute such subsidiary bodies as might seem to them to be desirable.VI. CommissionsThe Conference would be empowered to establishCommissions for the examination and preparation of important questions.      Such Commissions would be constituted if need beby the Conference at the end of each ordinary session, andwould normally report to the Conference at its next ordinarysession.-1 2r

VII. finance the expenses of national delegations will be borneby the Governments concerned.Common services will be financed by the participatingPowers in a proportion to be established by the Conference.VIII. secretarial the Conference would elect a Secretary-General whowould have the right, subject to the agreement of theConference, to appoint such staff as he might think necessaryfor the fulfilment of his functions.IX. RevisionProvision should be made for revision on suitable terms of any instrument setting up a Council of Europe,  so asto give effect to any possibilities of greater European Unitythat may emerge in the future.
