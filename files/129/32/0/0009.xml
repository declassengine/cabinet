(48) 257 of 8th November, 1948, Norway is seeking to extend her maritime jurisdiction over large areas off the Norwegian coast,which His Majesty&apos;s Government, for important reasons of principle, regard as high seas and which contain fishing grounds long frequented by British trawlers. A final attempt is being made to settle the dispute by negotiation,but it is doubtful whether the Norwegians will consent to terms which HisMajesty&apos;s Government or the British fishing industry could accept. The only practicable alternative is to submit the case to judgment by the international court. The Law Officers have given their opinion on the legal aspects of thisquestion.2. I recommend that, if agreement cannot be reached in current negotiationswith the Norwegian Government regarding Norwegian Fishery Limits, the dispute should be referred for decision to the International Court at The Hague,preferably by a submission agreed with the Norwegian Government.3. My colleagues will recall that the position which has arisen&quot;&quot; as a resultof differences between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Norwegian Governmentwith regard to their fishing rights off the coasts of Norway was considered bythe Cabinet on 15th November (CM. (48) 73rd Conclusions, Minute 4). It wasthen decided that: (i) An opinion should be obtained from the Law Officers pn&apos; the strengthof the British case. &apos;(ii) The prospects of arriving at a direct settlement with the Norwegians,while maintaining the status quo in the meantime, should be explored.(iii) All preliminary steps should be taken to enable the dispute to be referredto the International Court without delay should negotiations for adirect settlement prove abortive.4. An opinion of the Law Officers on the legal position in this matter hasnow been obtained and is annexed hereto. It will be seen from this that, whilethe Law Officers find it impossible to forecast with any confidence or accuracywhat might be the ultimate verdict of the International Court in such an uncertainmatter, they think it unlikely that the Norwegian claims to the so-called &quot; BlueLine &quot; would be accepted. They are inclined to believe, though here again theycannot advise with certainty, that the boundary which the Court might lay downwould probably be somewhere between the &apos;&apos; Green Line &apos;&apos; (representing a four-mile limit drawn strictly in accordance with established principles) andthe &quot; Red Line &quot; (which is the four-mile limit plus certain concessions to Norwayagreed as a modus vivendi in 1933). The Law Officers confirm the view alwaystaken by the Departments that, as against Norway, there is no chance ofestablishing a three-mile, as opposed to a four-mile;- limit. They are. however,confident that a submission to The Hague tribunal is, in principle, the right course. Further, they do not think that any substantial concessions going beyondthe &apos;&apos; Red Line &apos;&apos; modus vivendi should be offered to the Norwegians as a meansof avoiding the risk of an adverse decision by The Hague Court.36427
25. Meanwhile, in accordance with the Cabinet conclusion quoted inparagraph 3 (ii) above, we have had further inforrnal exchanges with theNorwegian authorities and technical discussions have how been started with a norwegian delegation in London in a final attempt to find a basis for a directsettlement. A new proposal has been made to the Norwegian representativeswhich iii our view offers the only remaining basis for an agreement by negotiation.Tlie proposal is that the disputed area of the Norwegian coastline snould. be divided into two sections roughly equal in length, in one of which (the southern half) we would in effect, though not in terms, accept the full Norwegian claimas embodied in the &quot;Blue Line,&quot; while in the other (the northern and, from: afishing point of view, more important one to the United Kingdom) the &apos;5 GreenLine &apos;&apos; would be observed (except that we would be prepared to give considerationto certain prescriptive Norwegian claims as regards &quot;historic bays&quot;). TheNorwegian representatives have, however, declared themselves unable to acceptthe &quot; Green Line &quot; as a basis even in the northern section alone, and have stated,as their minimum demands, that they would require further concessions going beyond the &quot; Green Line &quot; and at a number of points even beyond the &quot; Red.Line.&quot; With the object of exploring every possibility of a settlement a line hasbeen drawn up, incorporating these further concessions, which the UnitedKingdom Delegation have undertaken to submit to His Majesty&apos;s Government,while at the same time seeking the views of the British fishing industry. it remains extremely doubtful, however, whether such a settlement would commend itself to our fishing interests, who have shown themselves to be strongly opposedto offering any further concessions to Norway. Representatives of all the Britishtrawling organisations have in fact made it clear that they would prefer and indeed welcome reference to the International Court, rather than yield toNorwegian claims which they consider wholly unjustified, as well as seriouslydetrimental to British fishing interests. If, of course, further consultations withthe industry show that there is a possible basis for direct settlement, the attemptto draw up an agreement will be continued.6. In view of the situation outlined above and after consultation betweenthe Foreign Office, Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Scottish home department, I am of the opinion that, unless the negotiations which are now inprogress result in agreement on the basis proposed, it will be advisable to submit the case to the International Court for decision as the only practicable alternative.The opinion of the Law Officers has shown that, in that case, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would at least have a fair prospect of securing a reasonablyfavourable decision. The case could be instituted before the Court either by theunilateral application of one Government, or by a special agreement (compromis)of the two Governments to submit the matter to the Court. The latter courseseems preferable, if it is possible. Consequently, in accordance with the cabinet conclusion quoted in paragraph 3 (iii) above, the Legal Adviser of the ForeignOffice has drawn up, in consultation with Mr. Bull, the Norwegian Minister atThe Hague, a draft compromds ad referendtm to both Governments. This drafthas been submitted to the Law Officers, who approve it, and, therefore, it maybe considered satisfactory so far as His Majesty&apos;s Government are concerned. Ihave at present no information as to the views of the Norwegian Governmentupon it.7. In order to avoid further friction and incidents, it is very desirablethat the reference of the dispute to the Court, if it becomes necessary, should bemade with the least possible delay. I should therefore be glad of approval inprinciple for the course I have suggested, namely, that if it becomes apparentas the result of the present conversations that the Norwegian Government are unwilling to conclude a direct agreement with His Majesty&apos;s Government on an acceptable basis, negotiations should be discontinued and immediate steps takento secure a decision on this matter from the International Court, by special agreement if possible, otherwise by unilateral application.8. If the Cabinet approve my suggestions, this dispute will be settled either by agreement or by a decision of The Hague Court, but whichever is the meansof settlement a certain delay will ensue before the settlement is reached. It is most desirable to avoid the injury to relations with Norway and the othercomplications which will ensue if there are, during this period, further disputes and incidents resulting from Norwegian, interference with British fishing vessels in disputed areas.

The United Kingdom Delegation for their part havemade it clear that, if no such interim arrangement is made, His Majesty,&apos;sGovernment will make full financial claims in respect of all interferences with british fishing vessels which the ultimate decision of The Hague Court showsto be unjustifiable. If necessary, His Majesty&apos;s Government would bring thoseclaims before The Hague Court itself. Therefore, in the interests of Norway :as well as of the United Kingdom, the maintenance of the status gzio would seem desirable.E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,13th January, 1949.ANNEXOpinion of the Law Officers of the CrownIT is impossible in the present state of international law to formulate preciseprinciples defining the extent and character of the rights possessed by riparianStates in the waters bordering their shores. It can be said to be generally accepted that riparian States can claim as their territorial waters a stretch of sea of notless than three miles in width. This conventional limitation, however, based, asit would seem to have been, on a presumed &quot; portee de canon,&quot; can hardly be saidto be applicable to modern conditions, and we think the International Court wouldbe disposed to extend the scope of the rights of riparian States. The difficultyarises in ascertaining any general principles by reference to which the extendedrights over waters beyond the minimum of three miles can be formulated andmeasured.   But the following general observations may be made : -&quot;(i) There is little support for the existence of exclusive fishing rights assuch beyond whatever can be said in the case of any particular country.    to be its territorial waters.(ii) In the circumstances of the modern world, it seems clearly impracticable to revert to the &quot;portee de canon &quot; principle as the basis for fixingany new delimitation of the width of territorial waters, although wecannot exclude the possibility that the Court, influenced by the claims of several States, will be inclined to go much beyond the old three mile limit.(iii) Norway has, however, at least since the decree of 1812, claimed a fourmile width for its maritime boundary, and in the prevailing uncer-tainty as to the appropriate limit, the International Court might wellbe disposed to accept this limit as appropriate in the ease of Norway.(iv) It follows from (i) and (ii) above that such exclusive fishery rights asNorway possesses do not extend (and indeed are not claimed byNorway) beyond her territorial waters, but that at any rate for thepurpose of her fishery rights, her territorial waters should be accepted,. as is proposed, as being not less than, but not more than, four miles in breadth.If these conclusions are well founded, it becomes material to determine from what margin or line this breadth of four miles should be measured. On the whole,we think it unlikely that the arguments propounded by Norway in support of the
Blue Line !based dri forty-seven straight lines connecting forty-eight defined pointswould be accepted. It is hardly accurate historically to assert that&quot; this systemof measurement is not so far as Norway is concerned a comparatively recentdeparture. Although in the decrees of 1869 (to which the 1935 decree makesreference) and 1889 a system of straight lines connecting specific points wasadopted, it appears on reference to the charts that the result does not differ appre-ciably from what would be produced by a rigid application of the double radiusrule. Moreover, we think that the Court would be reluctant to accept the Nor-wegian arguments based on the economic circumstances of coast dwellers in these areas as sufficient ground for justifying encroachment on rights sec Jiypothesipossessed by other nations in the high seas off the Norwegian coast. On the otherhand, in favour of the double radius rule, it can be strongly urged that it producesa reasonably certain result in contradistinction to the completely arbitrary con-sequences of a measurement based on straight lines between points selected bythe riparian State, in effect without any international check. We think that theCourt would be disposed to approach the problem by applying the double radiusrule except where it could be shown that there were valid historical, prescriptiveor other similar reasons justifying the selection of a point further from the coastthan would be covered by that rule, the onus of establishing the existence of suchreasons being upon Norway. If this is correct, we think, on the information wehave, that a Norwegian title to air fjords which are genuine bays could be estab-lished, but equally on our existing information we think it unlikely that Norway:could prove her title to the whole area enclosed by the 1935 decree. To determinewith any greater degree of precision where the maritime boundary would probablybe drawn it would be necessary to examine with some minuteness the exact circum-stances and history of each of the stretches of water sought to be enclosed by the blue and Red Lines, which we are not able to do on the information with whichwe have been furnished.* In general, whilst we cannot advise with any degree of confidence or precisionin this very uncertain domain of international law, we think the Court would draw the boundary somewhat outside the Green Line, but probably in general not further out than the Red Line. In order, however, to obtain some formulation of principle as well as to reach finality in this particular dispute, we feel* confident that the appropriate course is to submit the matter to the international court. We think the draft agreement is suitably worded for this purpose andhave no comments to make upon it. An adverse decision of the Court would,of course, be considered as of great importance for the decision of similar disputes in the future, but we think that if the matter-were disposed of by agreementwith Norway, in any future disputes with other countries any concession made bythe United Kingdom to Norway would be referred to, and we do not feel that much is to be gained by avoiding, through agreement, the risk of an adversedecision by the Court.The Court has power to supplement deficiencies in the existing code ofinternational law by decisions, e.% aequo et bono if the parties agree, but wedo not think that if the Court applied this principle it would in the circumstancesof the present case operate to the advantage of the United Kingdom case, andwe would advise that at any rate for the. present the United Kingdom shouldnot agree.We accordingly answer the questions put to us as follows:^ 1. We certainly cannot exclude the possibility, but on the whole we thinkit unlikely that Norway would be successful in justifying her1935 decree.2 and 3. On the available, information, we think, though we cannot advisewith precision, that the boundary would probably be drawn somewherebetween the Green and Red Lines.(Signed) HARTLEY SHAWCROSS.Law Officers&apos; Department,7th January, 1949.
