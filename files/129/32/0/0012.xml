(3JL c^i *tU /y/.fj*i (f. * feS)J86IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT); S E G R E TCP. (49)  12 COPY NO.    1\17TH JANUARY, 1 949CABINETADMINISTRATION OF THE FORMER italian colonies IN africa memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and the Secretary of Statefor WarProblem1. Since their liberation in the earlier part of thewar, the administration of the former Italian Colonies in africa has been the responsibility of the War Office, and hasbeen carried out through the agency of a British military administration in each territory.      So long as our occupationwas on a purely provisional basis this arrangement may havebeen appropriate, but now that it is our definite intention toremain in Cyrenaica as trustee power (or if that provesunacceptable to the General Assembly, then on the basis ofsome direct arrangement with the Amir), it is desirable toorganise our administration of that, territory on a more permanent basis.      We consider that the importance that con-siderations of foreign policy have assumed in connection withthe problem of securing and&apos;maintaining our position in cyrenaica indicates that the Foreign Office is the Departmentmost suitable to assume responsibility for the administrationof Cyrenaica during this new phase.2. Any plans for the future administration of Cyrenaicamust at present be made on the assumption that we remain inthe territory as the trustee power.      These plans will, ofcourse, need modification if we remain on the basis of a directarrangement -with the Amir.3- It had been hoped that we might have been able toobtain a decision in favour of United Kingdom trusteeship forCyrenaica at the session of the Assembly in. Paris this autumn,thereby providing a suitable opportunity for introducing newadministrative- arrangements immediately thereafter.Unfortunately, however,  despite our efforts to persuade them todiscuss the problem, the Assembly decided to leave the italian colonies question over until their meeting in New York inApril.      We consider, however, that a decision of principle infavour of transferring responsibility for the administration of cyrenaica from the War Office to the Foreign Office ought now nolonger to be deferred.      In practice it will not be possible for technical reasons to bring into effect the actual transfer ofresponsibility immediately, but, if the principle is acceptednow, we hope that the transfer can&apos; take place in about threemonths&apos; time.4. It is not contemplated that British administration ofTripolitania should continue except as a purely temporary measure.      So long, however,  as we have to remain there (and-1

it will be remembered that it was agreed to recommend to the  -Assembly that the final decision as to the disposal of the territory should be deferred for a year), that territory&apos;s admini-stration should for political, economic and administrativereasons be the responsibility of the same Department as is responsible for the administration of Gyrenaica.      We con-sider, therefore, that a similar decision of principle shouldalso now be taken in favour of transferring responsibility .forthe administration of Tripolitania from the War&apos;Office to theForeign Office.5. As regards the two remaining territories of Eritreaand Italian Somaliland, we hope that the Assembly will inApril come to a decision which will enable us to relieveourselves of the responsibility of administering these terri-tories (with the possible exception of the western province ofEritrea, for which some special arrangement would then have tobe made) but, even if the Assembly does succeed in coming tosuch a decision,  a period of some months must necessarilyelapse before the decision can be implemented.      The admini-stration of these tv/o territories does not present the samepolitical and economic problems as that of Gyrenaica andTripolitania,  and the Foreign Office do not therefore wish toassume the responsibility for their administration.      On theother hand the War Office wish to be relieved of their responsibility.      We therefore consider that a decision regarding the future responsibility for the administration ofthese two territories should be postponed for further and more detailed examination.RecommendationWe recommend, therefore, that administrative responsibility for Cyrenaica and Tripolitania should be trans-ferred from the War Office to the Foreign Office as soon as thenecessary arrangements can be made.      For the latter purposea working party should be set up under the aegis of the FormerItalian Colonies Committee, with the terms of reference setout in the Annex to this paper.      It is recommended that theForeign Office, War Office, Treasury and. Colonial Office shouldbe represented on this body.We further recommend that this same working party should be charged with the task of examining the administrativeimplications which would arise if responsibility for theadministration of &quot;Eritrea and Italian Somaliland were to remain with the War Office,  so that further consideration can be givento the future administration of these two territories at anearly date.E. B.E. S.TI-I JANUARY,  1949.
