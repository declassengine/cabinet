Since this report was submitted to rne I have discussed with the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland theproposals put forward by his Government, which are discussed in Parts II - IV of the working party&apos;s reportc   I was accompanied at this meeting by the Lord Chancellor, the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of state for commonwealth relations.

As a result of that discussion I shall propose tothe Cabinet certain modifications of the recommendations putforward in the report of the working party.   In particular,I shall recommend that the title of Northern Ireland shouldnot he changed to Ulster, and that the change in the King*title should, be limited to substituting &quot;Northern Ireland&quot;for &quot;Ireland&quot;.   I shall also submit proposals on the points on which the working party made no specific recommendation(paragraphs 26 - 28 of their report).4* The draft Bill annexed to the report of the working party is being revised in order to reflect the results of these discussions with Northern Ireland Ministers.   The revised draftof.the Bill v/ill be circulated early next week together withthe recommendations which I shall make to the Cabinet in thelight of those discussions.

THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTSECRETGEN. 262/13IRELANDREPORT OF WORKING PARTY OF officials on 22nd November (CM. (48) 75th Conclusions, Minute 2) the Cabinet asked me to arrange for a working party of officials to consider what consequentialaction might have to be taken by the United Kingdom Government as a result of eire&apos;s ceasing to be a member of the Commonwealth.I assembled for this purpose a group of officials from the Common-wealth Relations Office, Foreign Office, Home Office, Scottish Office, Board ofTrade and Treasury. This group has throughout had the assistance of Parlia-mentary Counsel. We have also called into consultation, as required,representatives of other Departments concerned with particular aspects of ourproblem. In addition, the Home Office have held informal consultations with officials of the Northern Ireland Government.The conclusions and recommendations set out in this report represent theviews of the officials on the working party. :      -I.-general. As Eire is not to be regarded as a foreign country, despite the fact thatshe has severed all connection with the Crown and ceased to be a member of theCommonwealth, legislation by the Parliament at Westminster cannot be avoided.The need for legislation arises mainly from the fact that throughout the statute book the distinction between &quot; British &quot; and &quot; foreign &quot; in respect of persons,property, countries, ships, aircraft, &amp;c. is constantly made in terms of &quot; HisMajesty&apos;s dominions,&quot; &quot; British possessions,&quot; &quot;British ships,&quot; &amp;c. So far as concerns the application to persons of the existing law of the United Kingdom-an&amp;d-Colonies, we can rely on section 3 (2) of the British Nationality Act, 1948, whieiTprovides that enactments passed before 1st January, 1949, apply to Eire citizew-rjas-though they were British subjects. But, for the rest, we cannot escape without legislation the difficulty that after the commencement of the Republic of ireland act Eire will be neither &quot; a part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions &quot; nor &quot; a foreign country.&quot;   This difficulty may be illustrated by the following examples : (i) Under the National Insurance Act, 1948, and the National Insurance(Industrial Injuries) Act, 1948, pensions and certain other benefits are payable only &quot; within His Majesty&apos;s dominions.&quot; As Eire is notto be regarded as a foreign country, these benefits should not be with-drawn from persons who have qualified for them and have subse-quently taken up residence, temporary or permanent, in Eire; but, asthe law stands, there will be no authority to make such payments in eire.(ii) The National Insurance Acts give power to make reciprocal arrange-ments with other countries; and one section provides for arrangements with Commonwealth countries and a different section for arrangements with foreign countries. We are at present negotiating such a reciprocal arrangement with Eire; but, unless the law is changed, weshall not in form be able to conclude it under either of these sections.(iii) Under certain provisions of the Income Tax Acts, life insurance pre-miums paid to companies not established or carrying on business inthe United Kingdom rank for the ordinary life insurance premium reliefonly if the company is legally established in a &quot; British possession,&quot;and the treatment for income tax purposes of assurance companies mayvary in certain other respects according as their head office is or is not36362 &quot; jr
in a &quot; British possession.&quot; As Eire is not to be treated as a foreign,country, these provisions should continue to apply to the Eirecompanies, but they cannot be so applied as the law now stands.(iv) The various Acts under which customs preferences are granted to Eiregoods are drafted in terms which draw a distinction between foreigncountries and the countries of the &quot; British Empire &quot; defined, so faras is relevant, as &quot; His Majesty&apos;s dominions outside the UnitedKingdom.&quot;- There is also an open general licence permitting importsof specified goods from &quot; the British Empire,&quot; provided that they meetImperial Preference requirements. The Merchandise Marks Act,1926, similarly deals with marks of origin in terms of &quot; Empire &quot; or&quot; foreign.&quot; For all these purposes, legislation is necessary if Eire isto continue to receive the same preferential treatment as she wouldhave had if she had continued to form part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions.(v) The whole scheme of the Merchant Shipping Acts is based on a distinctionbetween British ships and foreign ships, under which the privileges and obligations applicable to &quot; British ships &quot; are extended to shipsregistered in any part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions and owned by aBritish subject or a company having its principal place of business inany part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions. If Eire is not to be treated as aforeign country, ships registered in Eire and owned by Eire companies should continue to be treated as &quot; British ships &quot; for the purposes ofthose Acts. It is also important that Eire ships should continue to betreated as &quot; British ships &quot; for the operation of the machinery for there patriation of distressed British seamen. When Eire has ceased tobe a member of the Commonwealth, these results cannot be achieved without legislation.The same system and the same considerations apply, broadly speaking, to aircraft.3. Theforegoing are typical examples of a difficulty which occurs throughoutthe .statute book in contexts affecting a wide range of administrative work. Thelaw of the United Kingdom is constructed on the basis that the countries of theworld can be comprehensively described as consisting of His Majesty&apos;s dominionsand foreign countries; and the statute book makes no provision for a country which, though not under His Majesty&apos;s jurisdiction or protection, is not to beregarded as &quot; foreign &quot; to the United Kingdom or other Commonwealth countries.It would be a laborious task to undertake a detailed revision of the statute1 book with a view to adding an express reference to Eire, or to Eire ships and aircraft, in every section which refers to His Majesty&apos;s dominions (by whateverdescription) or to British ships or aircraft. It would also be unsafe to seek to remedy the position by this means, for it would be impossible to completewithin any reasonable time the research required in order to identify everysection of the statute book which called for such amendment. The same resultcan, however, be achieved by a general declaratory formula to the following effect (i) that Eire is not a foreign country for the purposes of United Kingdomlaw and that statutory references to foreigners, aliens, foreigncountries and foreign ships or aircraft shall be construed accordingly;and(ii) that statutory references to His Majesty&apos;s dominions (by whateverdescription) or to British ships or aircraft shall be construed asextending to Eire or to Eire ships or aircraft, if those referenceswould have so extended had Eire remained part of His Majesty&apos;sdominions.A general formula to this effect will be found in Clauses 3 (1) and 4 (2) ofthe draft Ireland Bill prepared by Parliamentary Counsel, which is appended tothis report.4. There is one specific point which cannot be covered by this generalformula, viz., the tax exemption of the Representative of Eire in London. the tax exemption now enjoyed by him is derived from section 19 of the finance act, 1923, and section 26 of the Finance Act, 1925, which confer the exemptionon High Commissioners eo nomine. The corresponding tax exemption for foreigndiplomats is derived from statutory provisions in terms of representatives ofa &quot; foreign State.&quot; As Eire is not to be regarded as a foreign State, herRepresentative could not be accorded tax exemption under those latter provisions.
And the Eire Government would presumably be unwilling that he should continueto use the title &quot;High Commissioner&apos;.&apos; solely for the purpose of securing taxexemption. Clause 3 (2) of the draft Bill therefore deals specifically with thispoint by providing that the chief representative of Eire in London shall, whateverhis title, be in the same position as regards tax exemptions and other immunitiesas are the High Commissioners of Commonwealth countries; and that his staffshall be in the same position as the staffs of High Commissioners.1 5. It has been stated (paragraph 2 above) that, so far as concerns theapplication of existing law to persons, the policy of not treating Eireas a foreign country is sufficiently secured by section 3 (2) of the british nationality Act, 1948. If fresh legislation were not required for other reasons, we would not recommend that legislation should be introduced for the sole purpose of reaffirming section 3 (2) of that Act. It is,however, the fact that the scheme of that Act assumed that Eire would remain a member of the Commonwealth and that, at the time when the Act was passed,Parliament was not aware that Eire would cease to be a member of the Common-wealth immediately after the date on which the^A-ct was due to come intooperation. It might conceivably be argued that the basis of section 3 (2) andother provisions of the Act had been undermined by Eire&apos;s subsequent secessionfrom the Commonwealth; and this argument might be strengthened if it couldbe said that Parliament had passed later legislation consequential upon Eire&apos;sceasing to be a member of the Commonwealth and had not taken that opportunityof reaffirming the Act of 1948, notwithstanding the intervening change in thestatus of Eire.We therefore recommend that the new legislation should contain adeclaratory provision, on the lines of Clause 4 (1) (a) of the attached draft Bill, to the effect that the operation of the British Nationality Act, 1948,and in particular of section 3 (2) of that Act, is not affected by Eire&apos;s ceasingto be a member of the Commonwealth.6. Similar considerations apply (i) to existing statutory provisions giving effect to agreements made between the United Kingdom Government and the&quot;Government of Eire&quot; or the &quot; Government of the Irish Free State&quot;; and(ii) to Orders in Council made under section 6 of the Irish Free State(Consequential Provisions) Act, 1922. These agreements include, for example,the Trade Agreement of 1938, on which the customs preferences in part depend,and certain agreements regulating the position of Eire doctors and dentists inthe United Kingdom. The Orders in Council include the Irish Free State(Adaptation of Enactments) Order, 1923, on which depend various administrativepractices and procedures such, for example, as the practice under which, asbetween Eire and the various parts of the United Kingdom, each country appre-hends and hands over offenders by backing each other&apos;s warrants of arrest. Thearrangements for the enforcement of judgments, the service of summonses andcitations and the taking of evidence on commission also depend on that Order.We therefore recommend that the new legislation should include adeclaratory provision, on the lines of Clause 4 (1) (6) and (c) of the attached draftBill, to the effect that statutory provisions giving effect to earlier agreements between the two Governments and Orders in Council made under section 6 ofthe Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act, 1922, shall not be affectedby Eire&apos;s ceasing to be a member of the Commonwealth.7. As indicated in paragraphs 2 and 5 above, section 3 (2) of the british nationality Act, 1948, provides merely that the laws in force at thedate of commencement of that Act (1st January, 1949) shall apply to eire citizens as they apply to British subjects. Similarly, the proposed provision(Clause 4 (2) of the attached Bill) that Eire shall be treated as thoughit were part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions does not apply to future Acts: it isframed in terms of &quot;Acts passed before the passing of this Act.&quot;This means that those responsible for framing future legislation will have toconsider, in relation to all such phrases as &quot;British subject,&quot; &quot; His Majesty&apos;sdominions,&quot; &quot;British possession,&quot; &quot;British ship,&quot; &quot;British aircraft,&quot; &amp;c,whether it is intended as a matter of policy to include or to exclude Eire, itscitizens, ships or aircraft. Any Act passed after 1st January, 1949, wouldnot apply to a citizen of Eire as to a British subject; and in any act passed after the commencement of legislation on the lines of the attachedBill expressions such as &quot;British possession&quot; or &quot;British ship&quot; would not36362 b 2
include Eire or an Eire ship. Where, as will normally be the case, it is intended that Eire should be included, it will presumably be necessary either to mentionit specifically or, if no difficulty arises over British protected persons, protec-torates or protected States, to use such phrases as &quot; any country, not being aforeign country &quot; or &quot; any person, not being an alien.&quot;Current Bills now before Parliament doubtless include various references to British subjects, British possessions, &amp;c, which are not in line with the new policy by which Eire, after ceasing to be a member of the Commonwealth, isnot to be regarded as a foreign country. For example, the Wireless TelegraphyBill confines to British subjects the right to an experimental wireless licence;and, as the Bill will not become law until after 1st January, 1949, it will havethe effect that an Eire citizen will not be entitled as of right to obtain such a licence; and this, though probably unimportant, is inconsistent with the generalpolicy now approved by Ministers. It would be a laborious business to meet this point by proposing separate amendments on each of the current Bills now before Parliament on which the point arises. Moreover, the difficulty is not confined to Bills : it applies also to subordinate legislation. And some little time must elapse before all the legal branches of Departments responsible for preparingsubordinate legislation are fully aware of this new need for considering theposition of Eire, in relation to all references to &quot; British subject,&quot; &quot; Britishpossession,&quot; &amp;c, and practised in using the new formulae which will have tobe devised for covering, in accordance with existing policy, the special positionof Eire and her citizens.In these circumstances, we recommend that any legislation consequentialupon Eire&apos;s ceasing to be a member of the Commonwealth should include a transi-tional provision which would have the effect that the new system would not comeinto operation, either for Bills or for subordinate legislation, until after the endof the current session of Parliament. This can be secured by providing (on. thelines of Clause 5 of the attached draft) that section 3 (2) of the British nationality act, 1948, and Clause 4 (2) of the attached draft Bill shall apply, not merely toActs in force at the date of their commencement, but to Acts passed up to theend of 1949.8. The draft Bill contains no specific provision about the ForeignEnlistment Act, 1870. The main provision of that Act is that no British subject(or citizen of Eire, by virtue of section 3 (2) of&apos;&apos;the British Nationality Act,1948) may without permission accept engagement in the Forces of a foreign state at war with any foreign State which is at peace with His Majesty. Asthe Republic of Ireland will not be a foreign State, this Act, under the bill as it stands, would have no application to a war in which the Republic of ireland was a belligerent but His Majesty was neutral. The non-application of theAct might, in such circumstances, be thought inconsistent with the properobservance of the obligations of this country as a neutral, and there is thussomething to be said for excepting it from the effect of clauses 3 and 4 (2) ofthe Bill. To do so would, however, be contrary to the general scheme of theBill and, as in present circumstances the Act is largely ineffective in practice and as the point is likely to remain academic, we have thought it preferable not to deal specifically with this Act in the Bill. It may be, however, that thepoint will be raised in discussion of the Bill in Parliament. If so, and if thepoint is pressed, Ministers could consider adding to the Bill either a clausespecifically dealing with the Foreign Enlistment Act, or a clause enabling any existing Acts to be adapted by Order in Council so as to reflect more precisely the new relation between His Majesty&apos;s dominions and Eire. A power of this,kind would probably have to be limited in time and made subject to the affirmative resolution procedure; but it might, if the time limit were not too short, be of value in adapting other Acts over which unforeseen difficulties may arise.II.-CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS9. Part I of this report assumes that Eire can by her own legislation takeherself out of the Commonwealth, and that legislation-by the Parliament at westminster need do no more than adjust the law of the United Kingdom to meetthat position. It has often been stated that the fully self-governing members ofthe Commonwealth have the right and the power, by their own decision, to secede
from the Commonwealth; and the Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers haverecently advised (OP. (48) 254 : Annex &quot; B,&quot; paragraph 2) that India has powerto secede from the Commonwealth, effective both for her law and ours. this advice was given, however, on the terms of the Indian Independence Act, 1947,which points rather more clearly to the existence of the power than does theStatute of Westminster; and we are advised that, as a matter of law, it is arguable,on the terms of the latter Statute, that some provision by the Parliament at West-minster is required in order to complete the process by which a country ceases tobe a member of the Commonwealth. Ministers may think it desirable to forestallany such legal argument by including in the Bill a provision on the lines of clause 1 (1) (a) of the attached draft.The addition of such a provision would have the additional advantage of excluding, for all purposes of United Kingdom law, any future argument thatEire ceased to be a member of the Commonwealth, not merely from the date ofcommencement of the Republic of Ireland Act, but from the entry into forceof the new Eire Constitution of 1937. If this argument were at any time tobe substantiated before a British court, certain people might lose the advantages of section 2 (1) of the British Nationality Act, 1948 (which enables Eire citizens who were British subjects immediately before the commencement of that Act tocontinue as British subjects) on the ground that they lost their British nationalityin 1938 under the common law doctrine regarding the effect of cessions of british territory.10. The Government of Northern Ireland have asked that statutory force *should now be given to the assurance, which the Prime Minister gave on28th October and repeated on 25th November, that &apos;&apos; no change shall be madein the constitutional status of Northern Ireland without Northern Ireland&apos;sfree agreement.&quot; The specific suggestion made bv the Government of NorthernIreland is that legislation should be enacted by the Parliament at Westminsterproviding that the assent of the Northern Ireland Parliament shall be requiredfor any alteration in the law affecting (i) the relationship of the Parliament of Northern Ireland to the Crown; or(ii) the status of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom; or(iii) the responsibility of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom to the Parliament of the United Kingdom for the administration ofall matters affecting Northern, Ireland other than matters in respectof which the Parliament of Northern Ireland has from time to timepower to make laws.It has, however, been ascertained that the Government of Northern Ireland donot attach any special importance to the particular form of safeguard which theyhave suggested. They would probably be content if statutory force could be givento the simple assurance, already given as a pledge by the Prime Minister, that northern Ireland should not cease to be a part of the United Kingdom withoutthe consent of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.Now that Eire will shortly cease to owe any allegiance to the Crown, it hasbecome a matter of first-class strategic importance to this country that the Northshould continue to form part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions. So far as can before seen, it will never be to Great Britain&apos;s advantage that Northern ireland should form part of a territory outside His Majesty&apos;s jurisdiction. Indeed, itseems unlikely that Great Britain would ever be able to agree to this even ifthe people of Northern Ireland desired it. There should therefore be no political difficulty, as circumstances now are, in giving a binding assurance that NorthernIreland shall never be excluded from the United Kingdom without her fulland free consent. And, from the point of view of satisfying public opinion, notonly in Northern Ireland but in this country also, there is positive political advantage in doing everything possible at this stage to strengthen the positionof the North.11. The Government of Northern Ireland are not at present satisfied withthe assurance given by the Prime Minister on behalf of the present Government.It may be that they would be satisfied by a solemn assurance, in similar terms,given by the leaders of all political parties in the United Kingdom. If such an assurance would satisfy Belfast, there would presumably be little difficulty in persuading the leaders of the Opposition Parties to join in giving it.Legislation on these lines wouldconstitutional difficulties.
If, however, such an assurance were not acceptable to the Northern ireland government, a declaratory provision might be enacted to the effect that NorthernIreland shall not cease to form part of the United Kingdom save with the assent of the Parliament of Northern Ireland. A provision to this effect has been included in Clause 1 (1) (6) of the draft Bill annexed to this report, in a form inwhich it balances the declaration (paragraph 9) recognising that Eire has ceased to form part of His Majesty&apos;s dominions.12. We have given special consideration to the question whether Eire&apos;ssecession from the Commonwealth calls for any amendment of the Statute of West-minster, 1931. Apart from the preamble (which is discussed below), that Act, asit affects Eire, actually consists of provisions widening the powers of DominionParliaments, narrowing the powers of the Parliament at Westminster, amendingtwo sections of the Merchant Shipping Act, repealing portions of the ColonialCourts of Admiralty Act, 1890, and declaring that the expression &apos;&apos; colony &apos;&apos; in.United Kingdom Acts after 1931 does not include.a Dominion. There is nothing inthese provisions which is inconsistent with the new position of the Republic ofIreland and some of them, notably the provision as to the meaning of the expression&quot; colony,&quot; must remain in force in order to give proper effect to what is said in clause 4 (2) of the Bill about the construction of existing United Kingdom Acts.It would thus be unnecessary and inconvenient formally to delete the reference tothe Irish Free State in section 1 of the Act, which is the only part of the Act inwhich that territory is mentioned by name, especially as there are other existing acts (e.g., section 3 (2) of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, 1945, and the ships and Aircraft (Transfer Restriction) Act, 1939) containing references to Dominions&quot;within the meaning of the Statute of Westminster, 1931,&quot; which must stillinclude references to the Republic of Ireland.The preamble to the Statute of Westminster may, however, give rise todifficulty. The point might be made that legislation on the lines of Clause 4 (2)of the Bill annexed to this report, by providing, in effect, that references to HisMajesty&apos;s dominions in Acts already passed shall be construed as including Eire,might have the effect of reinstating Eire as one of the Dominions whoseassent is required, under the second paragraph of the preamble, to any alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne or theRoyal Style and Titles. Whether this as a legal argument is well founded ornot, there may well be political advantage in making it clear that Eire, now thatshe has denied all allegiance to the Crown, has no longer any say in the mattersmentioned in the second paragraph to this preamble. Accordingly, Clause 4 (3)of the annexed Bill makes it explicitly clear that the foregoing provisions of that clause will not have the effect of requiring the assent of the Dail to any alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne or the Royal Style and Titles.13. Section 2 (2) of the Regency Act, 1937, provides that a declaration ofregency shall be made to the Privy Council and communicated to the Governmentsof His Majesty&apos;s Dominions and to the Government of India. Now that Eire hassevered all connection with the Crown, it is clearly undesirable that such adeclaration should be communicated to the Government of Eire. Clause 4 (3) ofthe annexed Bill therefore makes it explicitly clear that the foregoing provisionsof that Clause will not operate to require such a declaration to be communicatedto the Eire Government.III.-TITLES14. The King&apos;s Title. It seems to us inevitable that there should be some change in the King&apos;s title.  The present title is : &quot; George VI by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and theBritish Dominions beyond the seas King, Defender of the Faith.&quot;Now that Eire has assumed the title &quot;Republic of Ireland&quot; by legislation passed with the avowed intention, and effect, of finally terminating Eire&apos;sallegiance to the Crown, it seems to us impossible that Ministers should advise his Majesty to continue to use a title which implies that His sovereignty extend to the territory henceforward to be known as &quot; the Republic of Ireland.&quot; if no other consequential legislation were necessary, postponement of a change in theKing&apos;s title might be defended on the ground that the anomaly could be tolerateduntil a convenient opportunity for legislation arose. But, if some consequential
legislation is to be passed, it seems to us to be necessary that (subject to theconcurrence of other Commonwealth Governments) it should include provisionfor making the necessary change in the King&apos;s title. The minimum change would be the substitution of &quot; Northern Ireland &quot; for &quot;Ireland&quot;; but, for reasons explained in paragraph 19 below, the majority of the working partyrecommend that Northern Ireland should in future be known as &quot;Ulster&quot;;and, if this change is made in the title of the territory, the change in the King&apos;title should be, correspondingly, the substitution of &quot; Ulster &quot; for &quot; Ireland.&quot;15. Proposals for changing the King&apos;s title are of course apt to give rise to difficulties. They provide opportunities for debating the nature of the Common-wealth relationship, in the course of which awkward questions may beraised. Other Commonwealth Governments must also be consulted; and thereis a risk that some of these Governments may seize the opportunity of suggestingwider changes in the title which would involve grave constitutional difficulties.Thus, Canada is known to dislike the reference to &quot; British Dominions &quot; in theexisting title, and would prefer the formula &quot; George VI of all countries of theBritish Commonwealth King by the Grace of God, Defender of the Faith.&quot; Andany proposals for a general change in the title would bring out constitutional difficulties in relation to India, and perhaps South Africa.If, however, Ministers accept our view that some change in the title is inevitable, these difficulties must in any event be faced and from this point ofview they are no greater if the change is to be from &quot; Ireland &quot; to &quot; Ulster &quot;than if it is to be from &quot; Ireland &quot; to &quot; Northern Ireland.&quot; The majority ofthe working party believe that it should be possible to avoid the major difficultieswhich would arise from any general change in the title; for the actual change proposed would be no more than the alteration of a single word in the existingtitle-viz., the simple substitution of &quot;Ulster&quot; (or &quot;Northern Ireland&quot;) for&quot;Ireland.&quot; In our own Parliament, the power to make the change would betaken in a Bill dealing only with Ireland, and any proposals for more extensivechanges would presumably be out of order. The representative of the Common-wealth Relations Office fears^ however, that if the change proposed were to substitute &quot;Ulster&quot; for &quot;Ireland&quot; some Commonwealth Governments mightconsult the Eire Government and might be induced by that Government to withhold their assent to the change. In that event the United Kingdom govern -ment might find it equally embarrassing either to proceed with the proposal orto withdraw it. In these circumstances the Commonwealth Relations office would prefer, either that there should be no immediate change in The King&apos;title, or that the change should be from &quot; Ireland &quot; to &quot; Northern Ireland.&quot;16. Title of Eire.-The Eire Constitution of. 1937 provided that--&quot;-th&amp;.national territory consists of the whole of the island of Ireland&quot; &quot;j5e**sfessaL,- andthe territorial seas&quot; (Article 2) and that &quot;the name of the State is Eire orin the English language Ireland&quot; (Article 4). The United Kingdom Govern-ment, for obvious reasons, were unwilling to recognise this assumption of the title&quot; Ireland &quot; and decided to describe the South for all purposes as &quot; Eire.&quot; Thisdecision was accepted by Mr. De Valera in an Agreement which he signed &quot; onbehalf of the Government of Eire,&quot; and effect was given to it by Section I ofthe Eire (Confirmation of Agreements) Act, 1938.For some years the title &quot; Eire &quot; was used by both Governments withoutdisagreement. During the war, however, the Eire Government began to dis-continue their use of the title &quot;Eire&quot; and to substitute &quot;Ireland&quot; for all purposes. This change which was doubtless designed deliberately to forwardtheir anti-partition campaign has now been carried to its logical conclusionby the Republic of Ireland Act, Section 2 of which provides that &quot; the descrip-tion of the State shall be the Republic of Ireland&quot;.17. Should we insist, in these circumstances, that, whatever they may callthemselves, we shall continue to describe the twenty-six counties as &quot; Eire &quot;IIn favour of this course, it may*be argued that (i) the claim made by theRepublic of Ireland Act is no different from that put forward in the Eire Coz?*ti-tution of 1937; (ii) the abandonment of the attitude which we have adopted onthis point since 1937 might be interpreted as a sign that we were weakening onthe Partition issue; and (iii) the Government of Northern Ireland are anxious that they and we should continue to describe the twenty-six counties as &quot;Eire.&quot;On the other hand, it is material that our use of the term &quot; Eire &quot; hashitherto been based on an agreement with the Eire Government which they have
now in effect repudiated. Secondly, the distinction is more apparent than real,,for &quot; Eire &quot; is only the Erse for &quot; Ireland &quot; and we may even appear ridiculousif we insist on using a description which in English has no meaning and in Ersehas the very meaning which we seek to deny. Thirdly, we have already failed tosecure that the twenty-six counties shall be described internationally as &quot; Eire,&quot;since the Eire Government have been able to take the advantage of the general rule that countries can select their own title. We must, therefore, face the factthat in international usage the twenty-six counties will be known as &apos;&apos; the republic of Ireland,&quot; and we shall therefore be seen to be following a policy of pin-pricksif we persist in using the description &quot; Eire.&quot; Finally, it should be noted that intheir recent Act the Eire Government have chosen to describe their State as &apos;&apos; theRepublic of Ireland &quot;, not &quot; Ireland &quot;; and there would be some debating ad-vantage, from the point of view of argument on Partition, in seizing this opportunity of describing the South as &quot; the Republic of Ireland &quot; or &quot; the irish republic&quot; and reserving the term &quot;Ireland&quot; as a geographical description ofthe island as a whole.18. We therefore conclude that the balance of advantage lies on the sideof discontinuing our use of the term &quot; Eire &quot; and adopting the title &quot; republic of Ireland &quot; as a formal description of the 26 counties. In official documents and correspondence the alternative &quot;Irish Republic&quot; would be permissible.The use of &quot;Ireland&quot; as a description of the 26 counties should, however,be avoided and the term &quot; Ireland &quot; should be reserved for use as a geographicaldescription of the island as a whole.19. Title of Northern Ireland-Tide Government of Northern Ireland haveformally asked that the title of Northern Ireland should now be changed to&quot;Ulster.&quot; . .Against this it can be argued that the historic province of Ulster included,in addition to the six counties now forming Northern Ireland, three other countieswhich now form part of Eire. Mainly, though not wholly, on this account theadoption of the title &quot; Ulster &quot; would give offence in Eire and possibly to numbersof Southern Irishmen throughout the world. The United Kingdom representative in Dublin is also satisfied that the adoption of the title &quot; Ulster &quot; would givefresh opportunities for anti-British propaganda by Eire in connection with the strong anti-British campaign which is likely to be developed by the eire government as soon as the Republic of Ireland Act comes into force. TheCommonwealth Relations Office endorse that view. They ask that, before afinal decision is taken, the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland should be made aware of the view held by the United Kingdom Representative in Dublin andshould, in particular, be asked whether he thinks it tactically wise that theNorth (i) should abandon any reference to the word &quot; Ireland &quot; in their title and (ii) should abandon the title &quot; Northern Ireland,&quot; with which their recordin the last war is so closely associated, especially in the United States.On the other hand, the majority of the working party feel that there must at best be some risk of confusion if the North continues to be known as &apos;&apos; NorthernIreland &quot; when the South is generally described as &quot;the Republic of Ireland.&quot;At worst, there would be an implied admission that the North should be regardedas a part of the &quot;Republic of Ireland &quot; and the case for Partition might thereby be confused, if not! prejudiced. At international meetings the South is boundto become generally known as &quot; Ireland,&quot; and United Kingdom representatives would find it easier to make it clear that they speak for the North if they were able to refer to it as &quot; Ulster&quot; rather than &quot;Northern Ireland.&quot; As a name&quot;Ulster&quot; is clearly to be preferred to &quot;Northern Ireland.&quot; &quot;The UnitedKingdom of Great Britain and Ulster &quot; is a rounder and more resounding titlethan &quot; the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.&quot; It wouldbe made clear that the new title &quot; Ulster &quot; related only to the six counties, and did not imply any claim to the other territory which forms part of the historickingdom of Ulster. It surely does not lie in the mouths of &quot;Southern Irishmen,who are laying claim to the title of &quot; Ireland,&quot; to object to our conceding tothe North the title of &quot;Ulster.&quot; Any representations from that quarter could properly be discounted. Moreover in present circumstances it is desirable thatsome positive encouragement should be given to the North.The majority of the working party conclude that the balance of advantagelies on the side of adopting the title &quot;Ulster &quot; for the six counties. We allagree, however, that the arguments against making this change should be put
to the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland before a final decision is taken by ministers.. 20. Legislation about Titles. -If it is decided that Northern Ireland should in future be known as &quot;Ulster &quot;, the legislation consequential on Eire&apos;s ceasingto be a member of the Commonwealth should include provision to the following effect; (i) Eire should in future be known as &quot;the Republic of Ireland.&quot;(ii) Northern Ireland should in future be known as &quot;Ulster.&quot;(iii) The United Kingdom should in future be known as &quot; the UnitedKingdom of Great Britain and Ulster.&quot; -&apos; - \(iv) The Parliament at Westminster should in future be known as &quot;the parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ulster.&quot;(v) The assent of Parliament should be given to the substitution, in theKing&apos;s title, of the words &quot; Ultonise &quot; and &quot; Ulster &quot; for the words&quot; Hiberniae &quot; and &quot; Ireland.&quot;21. Before any legislation to this effect was published, it would be necessaryto consult other Commonwealth Governments on the proposed change in TheKing&apos;s title. It is desirable that the proposal should be put firmly to the other commonwealth Governments as a necessary consequence of Eire&apos;s secession andthat prompt concurrence should be invited, so that the consequential legislationmay be passed by the Parliament at Westminster as soon as possible after thecommencement of the Republic of Ireland. Act.IV.-OTHER QUESTIONS RAISED BY NORTHERN IRELAND22. In addition to his proposals for changing the title and safeguarding the constitutional position of Northern Ireland, Sir Basil Brooke has also put-forward a miscellaneous group of proposals which are not strictly consequentialon Eire&apos;s secession from the Commonwealth. These are justified partly on theground that there is now no reason for continuing arrangements which were based on the assumption that Ireland would be reunited in the foreseeable future,and partly as measures designed to strengthen Northern Ireland against the anti-partition campaign which Eire is expected to launch as soon as the Republicis established. We have already drawn attention, in paragraphs 10 and 19 above,to the political importance of strengthening Ulster&apos;s position and giving hersome positive encouragement at the present time; and we have kept this in mindin considering these miscellaneous proposals.23. Boundary of Northern Ireland-Tine Government of Northern Irelandask that the question of their territorial jurisdiction should be put beyond doubt.In 1920 Northern Ireland was denned as the six Parliamentary Counties ofAntrim, Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Londonderry and Tyrone, and the twoParliamentary Boroughs of Belfast and Londonderry, and in 1922 a commission was appointed to delimit the boundary more precisely. The Commission^activities proved abortive. The boundary in Lough Foyle and the River- Foyleand in Carlingford Lough is open to dispute. Article 2 of the Eire Constitutionof 1937 provided that the national territory included the whole of the territorialseas of Ireland, and Eire spokesmen have repeatedly laid claim to the territorial waters round Northern Ireland.The Government of Northern Ireland claim that the County of Londonderryincludes the whole of Lough Foyle, which lies between the counties of Londonderry and Donegal, and the whole of the River Foyle in that stretchof it Which separates the Counties of Tyrone and Donegal. We do not believethat this claim could be sustained, and to raise the boundary issue would jeopardise the access to Londonderry, since the navigable channel in Lough Foyle hugs theDonegal shore. There is a similar risk in raising the boundary question inCarlingford Lough, where the navigable channel giving access to Newry is partly on the Northern Ireland side and partly on the Eire side of the Lough.There is no substance in the Eire claim to the Northern Ireland territorial waters, but the Eire Government have never taken any steps to assert theiralleged rights in these waters, nor is it clear what steps they could take to do so.36362 c
We accordingly recommend that no attempt should be made by the UnitedKingdom Government, whether by legislation or declaration, to define the boundary of Northern Ireland. Our main reason for this recommendation is that anysuch attempt might seriously prejudice our interests in retaining unrestrictedaccess to Londonderry in peace and war. ;24. Irish Lights Commission. The Government of Northern Ireland ask that the control of Northern Ireland lighthouses should be transferred from theIrish Lights Commissioners to Trinity House or the Northern LightsCommissioners. ,The Irish Lights Commission is a non-Governmental body, consisting of theLord Mayor of Dublin, the High Sheriff, three.Dublin Aldermen and seventeenco-opted members. It operates under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, drawsits funds from dues levied on shipping entering United Kingdom and Eire ports,and has to submit to the Ministry of Transport its schemes for the exercise ofits lighthouse powers.In 1920 it was decided to leave the Commission responsible for all lightsround the Irish coast; and since then the Commission has become more and morean Eire body. Thus, none of the present co-opted members comes from NorthernIreland, nor are Northern Ireland staff employed in the Northern Ireland lights.It would be impossible to transfer the control of Northern Ireland lighthousesto Trinity House or the Northern Lights Commissioners without raising the boundary issue, since two of the most important Lough Foyle lights and all theimportant Carlingford Lough lights are situated in .r Eire. Moreover, if thefunctions of the Commission in relation to Northern Ireland were transferred,it would still be necessary to subsidise from United Kingdom funds the main-tenance of the lights round the Eire coast, which are of more importance to united Kingdom shipping than to Eire shipping.We therefore endorse the view of the Admiralty and the Ministry ofTransport that the proposal for a transfer of powers should be rejected. Atthe same time We think it wrong that Northern Ireland should have no partin the administration of the Northern Ireland lighthouses. We suggest that sir Basil Brooke should be asked whether he would be satisfied if arrangements could be made on an informal basis for securing to Northern Ireland adequate representation on the Irish Lights Commission and the employment of a reasonableproportion of Ulstermen on the Commission^ staff.25. Extra!territorial Powers. The Government of Northern Ireland ask that the Northern Ireland Parliament should be given power to legislate oh matter^of common concern to Northern Ireland and Eire which involve no other part Ofthe United Kingdom. They also ask for power to enter into arrangements withother States, subject to the approval of the United Kingdom Government.The Northern Ireland Act, 1947, enables the Northern Ireland Parliamentto legislate with respect to certain specific matters of common concern tb bothEire arid Northern Ireland (viz.,. water, electricity, drainage, railway andhighway schemes athwart the land frontier). There seems to be no reason why this power should hot be extended to cover Other matters of common concern.For the rest it seems essential to preserve the principle that negotiationswith other States (i.e., foreign &quot;countries or Commonwealth countries) should be conducted by the Foreign Office or the Commonwealth Relations Office on behalfof the United Kingdom&apos; as a whole. This would not preclude, the Northern ireland government from being represented in any negotiations in which there was aspecial Northern Ireland interest.26. Qualification, for the Westminster Franchise. The Government ofNorthern Ireland ask that there should be a six months&apos; residence qualification for the Westminster franchise.Under the Representation of the People Act- 1948, the qualification for the westminster franchise both in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland is residenceon a qualifying date. The Government of Northern Ireland claim that eire citizens who are not really resident in Northern Ireland can get on to the registerby paying a short visit to Northern Ireland arOund the qualifying date and thatthe fact that there is only a land boundary between Northern Ireland and Eirejustifies imposing a six months&apos; residence qualification. A minority of the Elec-toral Registration Committee recommended that there should be a three months&apos;residence qualification in Northern Ireland, but the majority recommended thatthe qualification should be the same in Northern Ireland as in Great Britain, and
this view was accepted for the purposes of the.Representation of the People Bill.A new Clause requiring a three months&apos; residenop in Northern Ireland was moved in Committee by Sir Hugh 0&apos;Neill, j^^&apos;^M^;*$ttrt0-.* division.,There is force in the Northern Ireland contefition that the land boundarymajtes it gasy for non-residents to qWify ifor&apos;lAe&apos;Westmiiisfcgr franchise, and from1926 Wtil the 1939-45 war Northern Ireland had a six months&apos; period ofqualification&apos;for the Westminster franchise, whereas the period in Great britain was three months. On the other hand, the fact that Eire has seceded from theCommonwealth may not be regarded as sufficient justification for going back onwHalt^fis db^nerin the Represen^taitjon of the People Act, 1948.27. Qualification and Disqualification of Members of the. Northern Ireland.Parliameni.-The Government of Northern Ireland ask that the NorthernIreland Parliament should be given pqwer to legislate with regard to the qualification and: disqualification of Members of the Senate and House ofCommons in Northern Ireland. ,    ,Section 18(2) of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, applied the law relating to the qualification and disqualification of Members of the UnitedKingdom Parliament both to Members of the Northern Ireland Parliament andto Members of the Southern Ireland Parliament; ,iifortherri Ireland ^lfeady ^^^-B^r?^&apos;^&apos;----^^^^!^&apos; re ? r$ t0&apos;q^alififi^tiQ^s pf electors for their Parliament and it would&apos;seem logical and;convenient &apos;tq entrust to NoEthern Irelahcl the power to deal with the qualificationand disqualification of Members: - Section 5 of the Government pi Ireland Act,^^J&apos;&apos;ni!^^^tn:^t^rn^^hat ;.&apos;&quot;^is^ili^e^[&apos;.&apos;^f^&apos;Bm^ ihipbsed, dijectly oriindirectly, on grounds of religion, and this should ensure that there is no abusfein &quot;this respect: This proposal would, however, excite ^ome opposition in the westminster Parliament. -28. Supreme Caurt.^-r1he Government of Northern Ireland ask that thepower to legislate on all Supreme Court matters should be transferred to theNorthern Ireland Parliament: ,Section 47 (1) of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, reserved all matters relating to the Supreme Court, apart from the regulation of solicitors, &quot;untilthe date of Irish Union.&quot; Since then one or two other matters (e.a. summoning of jurors, land registration, registration of deeds) have been, transferred to.Northern Ireland. The Government of Northern Ireland claim that, Irish Unionbeing&quot;now&quot; out of the question, there is no justification for withholding from theNorthern Ireland Parliament, which has the power to legislate on other aspectsof-law and order, the power to deal with any Supreme Court matters. Inparticular, they point out that the present arrangement prevents their law from being brought up to date, because of the difficulty of securing the necessary legislation at Westminster.The proposed transfer would mean giving the Northern Ireland Parliamentcontrol of such matters as :  . ;r &apos; .(i) appointment of Judges of the High Court and Court of Appeal ;-&apos; (ii) constitution and jurisdiction of the High Court and the Appeal Court-(iii) procedure in the High Court and the Appeal Court;(iv) staffs of the High Court and th  Appeal Court.On general grounds of administration there is; a case for transferring/ to northern Ireland all matters relating1 to the Supreme Court. But there may bea good deal of opposition to the transfer from some sections in Parliament. Ifit were felt that the Home Secretary must retain control of the appointment of judges, it would be necessary for him &quot;to retain also control of the cbnstitutioiiof the courts. A possible solution might be to transfer the other matters&apos;;&apos;but any further partial transfer would probably be artificial and would hot satisfy the Northern Ireland Government, who attach particular importance to their proposal for a complete transfer.        i - -?9- Financial .Matters. The Government of Northern Ireland make fourproposals : (a) that the Joint Exchequer Board should be empowered to make a moreequitable distribution between the Northern Ireland and the ImperialExchequers of the revenue produced by estate duty payable on the estates pf persons who are domiciled in Northern Ireland when thevdie. At present estate duty is payable in the countrv where the36362 ?/ c V
property is situated, and persons domiciled in Northern Ireland have more movable property in Great Britain than persons domiciled inGreat Britain have in Northern Ireland;(b) that the Northern Ireland branches of the Bank of Ireland should betaken over by the Bank of England or that the Northern Irelandsection of the Bank of Ireland should be segregated completely fromthe Eire section;(c) that the fiduciary issue of the Bank of Ireland should be reduced fromthe present level of  749,240 to the  410,000 prescribed by the Banks(Northern Ireland) Act, 1928, or that the Bank&apos;s right to a share in thefiduciary issue should be cancelled; and\d) that the preferential treatment enjoyed by Eire concerns (which would include Eire banks) which operate in Northern Ireland under existingdouble taxation agreements should be ended. The point here is thatEire concerns are taxed at the low Eire rates on all their profits,including those earned in Northern Ireland, whereas the NorthernIreland concerns pay the high United Kingdom rates on all theirprofits, including those earned in Eire.The question of the allocation of estate duty has been examined on its meritsby the Inland Revenue, who have reported adversely on it as incompatible withtaxation principle, with existing tax law and with recent agreements foravoidance of double duty made with the United States and the commonwealth countries. It should be noted, moreover, that Northern Ireland wOuld not benefit financially from the change, since, if they get more local revenue fromestate duty, they would get so much less from the proceeds of Imperial taxation.The remaining three proposals are designed to diminish the status of theBank of Ireland by withdrawing its Imperial business, cutting down or abolishingits fiduciary issue and subjecting it to heavier taxation. As at present advised,the Treasury do not consider that, on the merits of the case, action should be taken on any,of these proposals. The present arrangements between the Treasury andthe Bank of Ireland work satisfactorily, Exchequer business is completely segre-gated in the Belfast branch, and to substitute a new agent (e.g., the Bank ofEngland) would be costly to the Exchequer. The taxation arrangements rest chancellor agreement between the United Kingdom and Eire Governments which coulddoubtless be denounced, but, in the view of the Board of Inland &quot;Revenue, shouldnot be altered. And, in the absence of a case on the merits, it would be difficult forthe United Kingdom Government to act as proposed by Northern Ireland without incurring a charge of deliberate victimisation.If, as seems to be the case, the real object of the Government of NorthernIreland is to asser.t control over local banking policy, the straightforward coursewould be to consider, with the Northern Ireland Government, how better provisioncan be made to regulate local banking; and the Treasury would prefer to do this in the first instance, though they do not rule out entirely the proposal that Imperialbusiness should be withdrawn from the Bank of Ireland.30. Form of Legislation relating to Northern Ireland. In Parts II and iii of this report it is recommended that any provisions altering the title of NorthernIreland or declaring that Northern Ireland will remain a part of the United King-dom should be included in the Ireland Bill. On the other hand, it will clearly beimpossible to include in this Bill any provisions dealing with the financial mattersdiscussed in paragraph 29 above. It remains to consider whether such of the other proposals made by the Government of Northern Ireland as it may be decided toaccept should be dealt with in the Ireland Bill in a miscellaneous NorthernIreland clause or clauses or should be left to be included in a Northern Ireland(Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to be introduced later in 1949. The Governmentof Northern Ireland would wish their proposals to be dealt with in the earlierBill and there would be considerable advantages in a single Bill from the Parlia-mentary point of view. On the other hand, if the proposals of the Governmentof Northern Ireland can be accepted only to a very limited extent, Sir Basil Brookemay be disposed to agree that it would be preferable not to make the necessary provision in the Ireland Bill.      ; &quot;V.-ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION31. &quot;We have considered a number of miscellaneous administrative mattersnot requiring legislation. On these we wish to submit the following recommendations.
32. National Service.- Section 3 (2) of the British Nationality Actj 1948,will have the result that, although Eire ceases to be a member of the Common-wealth, her citizens will continue, to be liable for national service in this countryin the same way as British subjects belonging to other Commonwealth countries^Mr. Costello has recently stated in a public speech that this liability ought inhis view to cease; but it is desirable that, as a theoretical liability, it shouldcontinue, as it will provide a useful argument in an international court insupport of the policy that Eire is not &quot;foreign &quot; to the United Kingdom. Inpractice it is unlikely to give rise to any difficulty. Eire citizens are not liableto be called up for national service unless they have resided in this country for-two years, and even then they are not liable if they are residing here for atemporary purpose. Those who are liable and raise any objection on the ground of nationality are given the chance of returning to Eire if they prefer to do that instead of performing their national service. Comparatively few of themraise objections, and most of them undergo their period of national service with-out demur. So far, they have not given rise to any difficulty the relatively small number who are called up are presumably people who have decided to throw intheir lot with this country and have made up their minds on that account toundertake national service as a public duty.We recommend that the Ministry of Labour should continue their existing practice in applying the provisions of the National Service Acts to Eire citizens.33. Commonwealth Committees. Few of the existing CommonwealthCommittees include a representative of Eire. For example, Eire is not a memberof the Commonwealth Communications Council or the Commonwealth air transport Council; and she withdrew in 1947 from the Commonwealth EconomicCommittee and the Commonwealth Shipping Committee. She is, however, amember of the following Commonwealth organisations :-(1) The Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux.(2) The Sterling Area Statistical Committee. -(3) The Commonwealth Liaison Committee for E.R.P.In the debate in the House of Lords on 15th December the Lord Chancellor saidthat after the commencement of the Republic of Ireland Act Eire would nolonger &quot;be entitled to membership of Commonwealth Committees which nowexist or may be appointed to deal with technical questions.&quot; The commonwealth relations Office should, therefore, inform the Eire Government that, When theRepublic of Ireland Act comes into operation, they will be expected, to withdraw their representatives from the three Committees noted above and, further, thatthey will not be entitled to membership of any similar Commonwealth bodies which may be appointed in the future. --A-^Ds^rtmenfes^htjuMsalso be warned that Eire is not entitled to membership of such bodies anoTwiat, when they control the business of such bodies, they should not, without prior consultation with theCommonwealth Relations Office, allow representatives of Eire to attend meetingsas observers, or to receive any special facilities or information.34. Scientific Research.- The Department of Scientific and Industrial Re-search have asked what policy should be adopted in communicating to Eirescientific information available to the United Kingdom Government and theresults of research undertaken by or on behalf of the United Kingdom Govern-ment. There will clearly be no obligation to communicate such information to eire in future.on the same basis as it is communicated to a commonwealth country. On the other hand, there will be no reason to withhold from Eireinformation which would normally be made available to a friendly, foreign country. In practice these questions must presumably be decided on&apos; theparticular merits of each case. Special considerations apply to research affectingdefence, and there the advice of the Ministry of Defence should be obtained.35: Civil Service Staffs. The general rules regulating recruitment to theCivil Service will not preclude the retention or future recruitment of Eire citizens who are otherwise eligible. Some Departments have, however, special Depart-mental rules. The; Service Departments, for example, at present require theircivilian staffs to be &quot; natural born British subjects whose parents were born inthe United Kingdom or in a self-governing Dominion.&quot; These rules do notattract section 3 (2) of the British Nationality Act, 1948, and would, therefore,exclude Eire citizens. We recommend that all Departments who have specialrules of this kind should review them so as to ensure that they do not operate to exclude Eire citizens who have hitherto been eligible for employment in those departments.
36. Contract Rates. For supplies and services rendered by the Admiraltyhigher rates are charged to foreign Governments than to Commonwealth Govein-ments. The same policy is presumably followed by other contract Departments.&quot;As Eire is not tp be regarded as a foreign country and as, in particular,the trade preferences for Eire goods are to be continued, all contract Depart-ihents should presumably be instructed to maintain any preferential rates whichhave hitherto been granted in respect of supplies and services rendered to Eire.37. Machinery of Government. The Cabinet have already decided (CM. (48J81st Conclusions, Minute 2) that Departmental responsibility for relations betweenthe United Kingdom and Eire should continue to be handled by the commonwealth relations Office.38. Various other points of administrative practice haye been raised by theDepartments whom we nave consulted, but these are not of such importance thatwe need trouble Ministers with them. The&apos;Commonwealth Relations (Office Tjyillbe able to advise Departments on these points of detail in the light of the decisions taken by Ministers on the main questions raised in this report. ,mVI.-SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS39.   Our conclusions and recommendations may be summarised as follows : (i) In order that Eire may continue to be regarded as &quot; not foreign &quot; to theUnited Kingdom after the commencement of the Republic of Ireland Act, legis-lation is required which will declare that Eire is not a foreign country arid pro-vide that in the existing law of the United Kingdom and Colonies references toHis Majesty&apos;s dominions (by whatever description) or to BritJRh ships or air-craft shall be construed as extending to Eire or %o Eire ships or aircraft if thosereferences would have so extended had Eire remained part of His Majesty&apos;sdominions.   (Paragraph 3.)(ii) This legislation should include a transitional provision extending to allActs and subordinate legislation enacted up to the end of 1949 the arrangementby which references to British possessions, British subjects, &amp;o, will be construed as including references to Eire, Eire citizens, &amp;c.   (Paragraph 7.) *&quot;&apos;:(iii) This legislation should also include a declaratory provision making it clear that Eire*s secession from the Commonwealth does not affect (a) the operation of the British Nationality Act, 1948, -and in particularsection 3 (2).of that Act;(b) existing statutory provisions giving effect to agreements made between theUnited Kingdom and the &quot; Government of Eire &quot; or the &quot; Governmentof the Irish Free State &quot; ; and &apos;(c) Orders in Council made under section 6 of the Irish Free State (Cpnse:qiiential Provisions) Act, 1922.   (Paragraphs 5 and 6.)(iv) This legislation should provide that the Representative of Eire in Londonand his staff shall, whatever his title, have the same privileges and exemptions asto taxation and otherwise as are accorded to Commonwealth High commissioners and their staffs.   (Paragraph 4.)(v) The legislation should not include any specific provision about the ForeignEnlistment Act, 1870. If this point should be pressed in Parliament, ministers should consider adding such a provision to the Bill or, alternatively, including a power to adapt existing&apos;Acts by Order in Council so as to reflect more precisely the new relation between His Majesty&apos;s dominions and Eire. (Paragraph 8.)(vi) Ministers may think it desirable to include in this legislation a provisipndeclaring that Eire ceased to be a part of His Majesty&apos;s- dominions as fromthe commencement of the Republic of Ireland Act.  (Paragraph 9.)(vii) Ministers will also wish to consider how Northern Ireland can be assured that her constitutional position will be safeguarded. If the Governmentof Northern Ireland will not be satisfied with a pledge given by the leaders ofall political parties at Westminster, it may be desirable to include in the proposed legislation a formal affirmation that Northern Ireland will in no event cease to be part of the United Kingdom except at the request and with the consent ofthe Parliament of Northern Ireland.   (Paragraphs 10-11.)(viii) The proposed legislation should&apos;make it clear (a) that the assent ofthe Dail will no longer be required to any alteration&apos; in the law touching the
Succession to the Throne or the Rdyal Style and Titlesand (6) that a, declara-tioh of regency heed not in future be communicated to the Government of Eire.(Paragraphs 12-13.) ,: . s ^ ,&apos; ,-4.       .... ,(T,(ix) It seems inevitable that; followipg Eire s assumption of the title Re-public of Ireland,&quot; there should be some change in the King&apos;s title.-The majorityof the working party support the proposal, put forward by the Government ofNorthern Ireland, that Northern Ireland should in future be kribwh as &quot; Ulster,&quot;and recommend that the change in the king&apos;s title should take the form of substituting &quot; Ulster &quot; for &quot; Ireland.&quot; The representative.bf .tfte\commonwealth relations Office fears that this proposal may give rise to difficulties with ntherCommonwealth Governments and would prefer, either that there should be hoimmediate change in the King&apos;s title or, alternatively, that the change shouldbe from &quot; Ireland &quot; to &quot; Nbrthern Ireland.&quot;   (Paragraphs 14-15.)(x) After the commencement of the Republic of Ireland Act, the UnitedKingdom Government should not insist on using the description &quot; Eire &quot; but should adopt the title &quot;Republic of Ireland&quot; as a formal description of,the twenty-six counties. For official purposes.the alternative &quot; Irish Rejpublic &quot;might also be used; but the term &quot;Ireland&quot; should be reserved. for use as &quot;ageographical description of the island as a whdle.   (Paragraphs 1^-18,)(xi) The inajority of the working party favour the adoption of &quot; Ulster,&quot;as the formal title of the six counties. The representative of the commonwealth relations Office would prefer that the six counties should continue to be knownas &quot; Northern Ireland.&quot; We all agree that the arguments against the change of title should be put to the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland before a finaldecision is taken.   (Paragraph 19.) . ,,, .   r(xii) If it is decided that Northern Ireland should in future be kiibwh as&quot;Ulster,&quot; the proposed legislation should include provision to the following effect:  .(a) Eire should in future be known as &apos;&quot;&apos; the Republic of Ireland.&quot;lb) Northern Ireland should in future be known as &quot;Ulster.&quot;(c) The United Kingdom should in future be known as&quot; the United Kingdomof Great Britain and Ulster.&quot;(d) The, Parliament at Westminster should in future be known as &quot; the parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ulster.&quot; A(e) The assent of Parliament should be given to the substitution, in theKing&apos;s title of the words &quot; Ultonige &quot; and &quot; Ulster &quot; for the words&quot; Hibernise &quot; and &quot;Ireland.&quot;   (Paragraph 20.)(xiii) Before the publication of any Bill including provision for these changes of title, other Commonwealth Governments should be consulted on the proposed change in the King&apos;s title.   (Paragraph 21.)(xiv) Ministers should reject the request of the Northern Ireland Governmentfor further definition of the boundary between Northern Ireland and Eire.(Paragraph 23.)(xv) Ministers should reject the proposal of the Northern Ireland Govern-ment that the Northern Ireland lighthouses should be removed from the control ofthe Irish Lights Commissioners. Subject, however, to the views of the NorthernIreland Government, an attempt might be made to secure for -Northern Irelandadequate representation on the Irish Lights Commission and the employment ofa reasonable proportion of Ulstermen on the staff of the Commission. (Para-graph 24).(xvi) The power of the Northern Ireland Parliament to legislate on mattersof common concern to Northern Ireland and Eire might be extended.(Paragraph 25.)(xvii) We discuss the arguments for and against amending the qualification for exercising, in Northern Ireland, the Westminster franchise.   (Paragraph 26.)(xviii) We discuss the suggestion that the Northern Ireland parliament should be empowered to legislate with regard to the qualification and disqualification-cation of members of the Senate and House of Commons in Northern Ireland.(Paragraph 27.)(xix) We discuss the proposal of the Northern Ireland Government that theirParliament should be empowered to legislate on all matters affecting the SupremeCourt in Northern Ireland.   (Paragraph 28.)(xx) Ministers should reject the financial proposals put forward by theGovernment of Northern Ireland.   Those affecting the allocation of estate duty are
inconsistent with existing law and international agreements, and would not inany event bring any financial benefit to Northern Ireland. The other proposals aredirected against the Bank of Ireland; but the Treasury would prefer to consider with the Northern Ireland Government how better provision can be made toregulate local banking in Northern Ireland.   (Paragraph 29.)(xxi) When it has been decided how many of the miscellaneous proposals putforward by the Northern Ireland Government can be accepted, it will be for con-sideration whether provisions giving effect to those proposals should be includedin the early legislation required to give effect to the other recommendations madein this report or whether they should be reserved for inclusion in a NorthernIreland   (Miscellaneous  Provisions)  Bill  to  be  introduced later in  1949.^(Paragraph 30.)(xxii) The Ministry, of Labour should continue their existing practice in applying the National Service Acts to Eire citizens. (Paragraph 32.)(xxiii) The Eire Government should be informed that, when the Bepublicof Ireland Act comes into operation, they will be expected to withdraw theirrepresentatives from the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux, the Sterling AreaStatistical Committee, and the Commonwealth Liaison Committee for E.R.P.;and that they will not be entitled to membership of any similar Commonwealthbodies which may be appointed in the future. Departments should also be warned that Eire is not entitled to membership of such bodies and that, where theycontrol the business of such bodies, they should not allow representatives of Eireto attend meetings as observers or to receive any special facilities or information.(Paragraph 33.)(xxiv) Departments need not withhold from Eire scientific information whichwould normally be made available to a friendly foreign country. The advice ofthe Ministry of Defence should, however, be obtained before communicating to eire information about defence research. (Paragraph 34.)(xxv) Departments having special rules regulating the recruitment of staff should review those rules so as to ensure that they do not operate to excludeEire citizens who have hitherto been eligible for employment in those Depart-ments.
