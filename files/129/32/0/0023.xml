j[3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (49)  23 COPY NO.   It7TK FEBRUARY, 1949CABINETGERMANYREPARATIONS AND PROHIBITED AND LIMITED industries memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe United States Government have represented thata decision must be taken by 12th February on proposals thatthe Economic Co-operation Administrator has made for thereduction of the reparations lists.      I have been examiningour policy in this matter, in relation to the cognatequestion of the prohibition and limitation of certain Germanindustries, which, is also due to be settled between theUnited States, United Kingdom and French Governments.      Iconsider that it is very much in our interest that these two questions should be settled quickly and together.      Since time may well preclude further reference to my colleagues, I amseeking &apos;a wide measure of discretion to make concessions inthose fields which are not of the highest importance to our security.     The proposals which are set out in this memorandum are based on the expert advice of the Departments concerned.recommendations. I accordingly invite my colleagues to authorise meto negotiate with the United States and French Governments asettlement of the questions of reparations and the prohibitionand limitation of certain German industries on the following(a) That the policy embodied in existing instructionsbased on CP. (43)  203 of 13th August, and cp. (48) 303 of 20th December, should be pressedupon the United States Government.(b) That, if necessary to obtain a settlement, weshould agree to leave in Germany all the plantsrecommended for retention by the United StatesGovernment other than the five listed at Annex A.(c) That, if absolutely essential to reach agreement,the concessions&apos;listed at Annex B with regardto shipbuilding and shipping, synthetic rubber,ball and roller bearings, and machine tools mightbe offered.3. In CP. (48) 203&apos;and CP. (48) 303 I submitted to my &apos;colleagues proposals for the prohibition and limitation ofcertain German industries, and for a reduction of the reparations lists, in the interests of European recovery, by .117 plants.     These proposals were accepted by my colleagues on 16th August and 22nd December, 1948 (CM. (48) 56th Conclu-sions, Minute 7 and 82nd Conclusions, Minute 2);    it -was-1-

also agreed that I might at my discretion approve theretention in Germany of certain further plants if this&quot;became necessary to oh tain agreement and provided itformed part of a solution satisfactory to ourselves inregard to the prohibited and limited industries and tothe establishment of a Ruhr Authority.      A satisfactory agreement to establish a Ruhr Authority has already.beenreached;    and preparations had been made for early nego-tiations about reparations and the prohibited -and limitedIndustries on the assumption that these would be held in washington.      However, on l+th February, the United states ambassador, acting on the instructions of his Government,pressed for the question of reparations in relation to theEuropean Recovery Programme to be settled by 12th February,the day on which Congressional discussions of the Second.Appropriation for E.R.P.  are due to begin.      I pointed out to him that it would be difficult for me, and probablyimpossible for the French, to agree with the United StatesGovernment on the one question without obtaining from thema satisfactory settlement of the other.      But on the under-standing that the United States Government agree to this,I would be prepared if necessary to accept Mr. Douglas&apos;proposal that he and I should meet the French ForeignMinister in order to get the two questions finally settled.hi After consideration of all the factors, I have come to the conclusion that there would be great benefit in securing a quick and final settlement.      I therefore consider that we should be prepared if absolutely necessaryto make substantial further concessions to the United StatesGovernment in order to reach agreement.      Since the time factor will make it impossible for me to refer again to mycolleagues while the negotiations are in progress about any matters in dispute, I must ask them for a wide measure of discretion and for authority to make, if it proves essential,more concessions than I hope it will be necessary to offer.REPARATIONS AND E.R.P.5. Of the 167 plants which the United States Governmentrecommend for retention in Germany, there are five whichpossess in themselves such a measure of war potential thattheir retention in Germany would be both incompatible withour basic policy of demilitarisation and damaging to our prestige.      These are listed in Annex A, together with thereasons for removing them.      There is one particular plant to which I would draw special attention - and 132U, AugustThyssen-htltte, the steel plant at Hamborn.      Although thiswas not included in the 1 67 plants which the HumphreyCommittee had in mind to retain in Germany during the recent .official talks in London, the United States Government now recommended that, in order to meet the temporary shortage ofsteel, this plant should be retained in Germany for a periodof up to five years.      They propose that during this time itshould be administered on an extra-territorial basis by the occupying Powers, and that it should be dismantled and removedas reparations at the end of the period.      The plant is capable of producing over two million tons of steel a year.In my opinion, it would be politically quite impossible toremove the plant at the end of two (still less five) years.Acceptance of the United States&apos; proposal would therefore amountto the permanent retention of this additional steel-making capacity in Germany, and would in effect if not in form nullifythe Allied security agreement which limits Western Germansteel production to 11.1 million tons a year.      Moreover, I

see no economic justification for the American proposal,since it is not capacity to produce steel hut shortage ofraw materials which limits, and is likely to continue to limit European steel production throughout most of theperiod in question.      If we were to leave the Hamborn plantin Germany and to give it priority in the distribution of scrap and iron ore, this would merely mean that otherplants in Germany and elsewhere would be obliged to go1short.      The prejudice to security would be great:    theadvantage to European recovery speculative.      I consider,therefore, that we must reject the proposal in so far asit relates to the steel-making capacity, though we could agree to the retention of certain ancillary parts of theHamborn plant which might be made to serve a usefulproductive purpose.PROHIBITION AND LIMITATION OF INDUSTRIES6. Between the British and American positions thereare major differences in respect of the following industries:Synthetic Rubber, Ball and Roller Bearings, Machine Tools,and Shipbuilding.      I. set out below my views, based on theadvice of the qualified Departments, as to how these mattersmight be dealt with in negotiation.     At some risk to security, we could offer a compromise which would (a) permit the retention in Germany of certain plant in the syntheticrubber industry which might be usefully employed in producing materials required by the growing plasticsindustry, and (b) reduce from 21  to 8 the number of types of heavy machine tools the production of which v/e should seek to prohibit,      Despite the risks to security, wecould in the  last resort also agree to the retention ofall plant for the manufacture of ball and roller bearings(estimated to have a capacity of 42 million units a yearoperating on a single shift basis).      German requirements have been estimated at no more than 27 million units a year,and this industry could therefore make a useful contributionto German exports.      A concession in this field would be particularly valuable from the American point of view.With regard to shipbuilding, I would not seek to make any concessions beyond those set out in O.R.0.(1+8) 9 of1st April, 1948, and confirmed in CP. (48)  203 of 13thAugust, 1948.      There remain, however, certain quadripartitedirectives which limit the types of coastal&apos;vessels and small craft which may be built,      I understand that theFirst Lord of the Admiralty is considering in what respectthese might be modified and will be in a position to statethem at the Cabinet meeting at which this memorandum isconsidered.     .  Proposals on the above lines are set out at annex B.7. I accordingly invite my colleagues to authorise meto negotiate v/ith the United States and French Governments asettlement of the questions of reparations and the prohibit ionand limitation of certain German industries on the basis setout in paragraph 2.E.B.Foreign Office, S.W.1.7TH FEBRUARY, 1949.

ANNEX *AT 205REPARATIONS AND E.R.P.MINIMUM LIST OF PLANTS TO BE RETAINED ON REPARATIONS LISTCHEMICALS1.     and 2.01x2.   I.G. Farben, Ludwigshaven - plant for bunaproduction.This plant in the French Zone is one of the threesynthetic rubber plants in Western Germany.   The removal ofcertain equipment from it is essential.   We are prepared forthe remaining equipment to be retained in keeping with our proposals for the synthetic rubber industry - see Annex B.STEEL2*     and 132U   August Thyssenhlitte, HambornThe retention of this plant, which has a potential pro-ductionof more than two million tons of steel a year, is incompatible with the agreement that German steel production for the Bizonal Area should be limited to 10.7 million ingottons a year.    Ore and scrap could only be supplied to thisplant at the expanse of other plants already operating inGermany and other Western European countries.   There is no guarantee that Thomas steel, which would be the principal productfrom. Hamborn, would be acceptable in world markets.   It wouldbe impossible, as. the Americans suggest, to operate this plant for five years, and then to dismantle it as reparations.   Inaddition, to do so would lay us open to those very charges which we have levied against the U.S*S*R. in regard to- theirSovietische Aktiengesellschaften (SAGs).   We are preparedhowever in the interests of reaching an early settlement toagree to the United States minimum proposal for the retentionfop   the German economy of ore sintering and power generatingfacilities not dependent on the use of blast furnace gas, andto   the retention of the electric sheet capacity provided thatthis does not involve the retention of facilities for supplyingsheet mill slabs tc the sheet mill.3*     and 1325     Deutsche Edelstahlv/erke - Krefeldh.     and 1327     Deutsche Edelstahlwerke - BochumThese two plants, with their concentration of technicalskill and facilities for the production of special steels,played an outstanding part in the German war effort and constitutein our view a real clanger to security.    The needs of the german economy can easily be met from the production of other steelfirms retained in Germany.5.     and 1320   Bochumer Vc re in Gussstahlfabrik, BochumThis plant was previously released by the Humphrey Committee,but the State Department have already approached us asking forretention.   Dismantling had already started before this request was made and certain labour troubles occurred at another partof the same works which made it impossible for us to meet theUnited States request.    This was explained to the State Depart-ment and we understood they had accepted the reasons why wecould not agree.

1-      THE GERMAN SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRY AND MERCANTILE MARINEThe present British proposals are those approved bythe Overseas Reconstruction Committee in April, 1948 (O.R.C.(48)1st Meeting, Minute 3).   V/e have, however, let it be known thatwe are willing to make certain amendments in the AeCA. Directiveswhich at present govern the building of coastal and fishing vessels in Germany.2. There can be no concession over the three further ship-yards that still remain to be declared available for reparations.There can be no concession over the principle, which is vital,that the characteristics of the vessels built in the Germanshipyards should be subject to predetermined limitations, norover our contention that the A.C.A. Directives remain in force until by agreement superseded;   and it is our view thatthese Directives should be held to apply to all ships at thedisposal of the German economy.   There is, however,  some scope for negotiation as to what the limitations on the characteristics of ships should be.3. Subject to the views of the First Lord of theAdmiralty and of the Minister of Transport, I think we shouldbe prepared to accept now the following amendments toDirectives Nos. 37 and 44 as concessions to the United Statesview and in the interest of the German economy:-(a)   Directive 37(i)   Raising of restriction on electric power from 20 to 30 kW.(ii)   Abolition of the limitation on intended radius of action, provided existing machineryrestrictions are maintained.(b)   Directive 44(i)   Raising of restriction on tonnage from 400to 500 g.r.t.(ii)   Extension of the permitted length to amaximum of 150 feet.(iii)   Abolition of the restriction that not more than ten ships should be built to one design.If these concessions are not sufficient to secure UnitedStates agreement, it might be suggested that in order not to delay a settlement on other points the matter should bereferred to the Military Security Board (which has in any case to review all quadripartite legislation that has a bearing onits task) and the Board instructed to make a fresh study ofthe problem and to submit recommendations through the military governors to the three Governments.4. If necessary-y we might also agree that nogeographical limitations should be imposed upon the operationof the German coastal fleet.ANNEX &apos;BTPROHIBITED AND LIMITED INDUSTRIES

IX&apos;      PROHIBITED AND LIMITED INDUSTRIES OTHER THAN SHIPBUILDING5* The principal points in dispute with the United StatesGovernment concern the industries dealt with below.Synthetic Rubber6. It is agreed that the manufacture of syntheticrubber should be prohibited!    the disagreement concerns the plant to.be removed as reparations.    There are three factories in question - Leverkusen, Ludwigshafen and Huls.   Leverkusendraws its supplies of butadiene from Huls.   If necessarywe could agree to a settlement on the following lines:-to be removed entirely50^0 of all plant in the styreneside to be removed, with all plant for co-polymerisation and later stages, and with all plant forthe production of butadiene fromthe immediately preceding inter-&quot;mediate.7* We should fight hard to secure agreement upon some reduction of capacity and upon a continuing limitation to the capacity as thus reduced.   But in the last resort we could accept the U.S. proposal that capacity should be limited to existing capacity.Machine Tools8. In 1946 a quadripartite list was drawn up of restrictions to be imposed on the manufacture of certain types of machine tools in Germany.   Most of these restrictions havethe form of prohibitions on the manufacture of machine toolsabove certain sizes.   This list is unnecessarily restrictive,but provides a useful basis for discussion^   The British proposal is that, in addition to the general prohibition onthe manufacture of machine tools, designed for the productionof war materials, 20 items should stand part of the list andan additional prohibition be added on the manufacture of spiralbevel gear-cutting machines of all sizes.   The French support us on all but 3 items.9. If really necessary for the sake of an overallagreement, we should make the following concessions: -First ConcessionRestrictions on the 3 items on which the French donot support us*Second ConcessionRestrictions on milling machines (2 items).Third ConcessionRestrictions on Lathes, Round table surface grinders,and Precision jig boring machines (8 items).We should stand firm on the remaining items.LeverkusenLudwigshafenHulsBall and Roller Bearings
