/ 83-/ - -(THE DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret-M49) ^ COPY NO^. (14-TH JANUARY,  1949CABINETMEAT ration memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Pood -1* Owing to the shortfall in Argentine shipments underthe Andes Agreement the carcase meat stock position is such that we cannot continue the one shilling ration of carcase meat.   We can, however, for a period maintain the total meat ration at one shilling by including twopence worth of canned meat.2. Carcase meat stocks available for the ration atpresent total 85,000 tons, but we are in a period of lowsupplies from United Kingdom farmers and we are using stocksof imported ration carcase meat at the rate of about 10,000tons per week above the rate at which it is arriving from overseas.   Unless we reduce the rate of issue we shall be downto about 12,000 tons actually in store at the end of February.This is well below the level at which distribution can be handled.3. I am, therefore, bound to recommend a reduction by2d. in the carcase meat ration as from 23rd January.   It willsave about 4.500 tons per week and leave us with a workingstock at the end of February of about 34*500 tons (less than two weeks&apos; supply at lOd.) which although much lower than iscomfortable, is just sufficient to maintain distribution.4* As far as v/e can see, if Argentina continues shipping at the rate of 300,000 tons a year, which is the rate of ship-ment in recent months, and provided we get no   setbacks, we ought to be able to hold the ration at about the same leveluntil v/e begin to benefit from increased home supplies inAugust.5. The Andes Agreement provided for imports of 400,000tons from February, 1948, to February, 1949*   Argentina actuallydelivered in the calendar year 1948 only 312,000 tons.   We havetaken action through our Ambassador in Buenos Aires to get themto ship the backlog as soon as possible and negotiations will,I hope, begin soon for a new Agreement, but the outcome of these negotiations is uncertain and cannot affect our immediateposition.6. There remains the question how long we should continueto use canned meat to maintain the overall one shilling ration.We have for some years worked upon a decision taken duringthe war that for prudent reasons (partly strategic) stocks of canned corned meat should be, at the beginning of the period of low supplies of home-killed meat in the late autumn, not lessthan 80,000 tons, but that they could be permitted to fall to-1

60,000 tons in the first half of the year provided, there wasa good prospect of their being made up to 80,000 in the second half.7* Stocks of canned corned meat at the end of Decemberwere 68,000 tons.   We have in sight about 19,000 tons of nettimports by the end of June, making 87,000 tons in all.   Theissue of 2d. worth a week takes about 2,700 tons, which means that if we stand by the decision that the stocks must be60,000 tons at the end of June we can only issue canned meatat the rate of 2d. in the ration for ten weeks.   This would bring us to 2nd April.   If we are to continue to put out the2d. worth of canned meat until home supplies of carcase meatbegin to increase, about 1st August, canned corned meat stockswould drop to 10,000 tons.8* It must be remembered that we depend largely uponArgentina not merely for a considerable part of our carcase meat supplies but also for replenishing our stocks of canned meat.   Expert opinion is doubtful v/hether the Argentine Govern-ment, even with the best of good will, can give us in 1949much more carcase meat than they have given us in 1948, though hope that our negotiators will be given authority to getall they can.   But if we press them to give us very much larger quantities of canned corned meat than we had last year theymight only be able to do so by canning meat which would other-wise come to us as carcase meat.   There is the possibility thatthe United States will not this year take the 45,000 tons of canned corned meat which they took last year, thus considerablyeasing the position.   There is, however,&quot; no possibility of purchasing canned corned meat from the United States.9* For these reasons I hesitate to recommend that weshould run our canned meat stocks down below 60,000 tonsuntil we see what this year&apos;s total supplies - carcase andcanned - are likely to be.   On the other hand,  to reduce the\\ overall ration to below one shilling would be, in my opinion,I a culminating disaster in our food position.   As on past experience we can hardly expect to have a very clear indicationfor many v/eeks of the outcome of the Argentine negotiations,I suggest that wo should substitute canned meat for carcase meat in the ration to the extent of 2d. from 23rd January and review the position in mid-March.   Such a course makes it most urgent to press on with the Argentine negotiations at the earliestpossible moment and to make the greatest possible effort tosecure (i) enough carcase meat to sustain a one shilling rationduring the lean first half of 1950 when home supplies are low.and (ii) enough canned corned meat to bring up our stocks andassured supplies to something approaching 8o,000 tons againby 1st January, 1950.    If we appear to be in sight of reachingthese objectives when we review the position in mid-March, Ithink we shall be justified in continuing to issue the 2d.y/orth of canned corned meat until the end of next July, thusbringing our stocks down to 10,000 tons.   If, however, we donot seem likely to be able to achieve these objectives, I can see no alternative but to cut the total ration of carcase andcanned meat to lOd. for the months of April, May, June and July.For, disastrous as that course will be,  it would I.submit beeven worse to enter 1950 with very low stocks.10. I prouose to announce this change iii the meat rationat once and I snail be able at the same time to say that the bacon ration will go back to 2 ounces as from 30th January.J.S.Ministry of Food, S.W.I.,14th January, 1949*
