THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1949SECRET Copy No.CP. (49) 1417 th January, 1949CABINETTHE NATIONAL INSURANCE SCHEMESMemorandum by the Minister of National insurance the two National Insurance Acts (the National Insurance Act, 1946, andthe National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act. 1946), came into full operation on 5th July, 1948; though under the terms of the main Act the new deathgrants will not start until July 1949. The 5th Jiily, as the date for startingthe new scheme of social security, had to some extent been anticipated. the family Allowance Scheme, under which we are paying allowances for over4^ million children in about 2,900,000 families, started on 6th August, 1946;old age pensions were increased to 26s. and the retirement condition introduced as from October 1946; extended unemployment benefit for people who hadexhausted their ordinary benefit rights became available in January 1947; andthe new rates of unemployment benefit were brought into operation in June 1948.2. Between 5th July and 31st December, 1948, over 4 million* claims to benefit have been dealt with by the local offices of my Department. A breakdown of this figure is given in the Appendix- to this memorandum. This very consider-able volume of claims has on the whole been handled expeditiously and there havebeen few complaints. Cases of delay in payment of benefit inevitably occur fromtime to time. In some instances they are due to lack of suitable or suitably placedpremises. In others, delay is due to a misunderstanding of some kind or failure by claimants to furnish, or by my officers to obtain, some information needed to enable a claim to be decided. A special instance of this is that about 35 percent, of the claimants still fail to give their National Insurance Number, whichis needed for quick reference to the insurance records. The steps taken toexplain the scheme to the public, which included the distribution of a HouseholdGuide to every household and numerous leaflets on special topics, were on thewhole successful. JTJhe^ public jare co-operating well; and, as the difficultiesconnected with the transition from the ola system toTKeTnew are left behind andthe public, as well as my own staff, get more familiar with the new schemes and with the procedure, I am confident that the service to the public can be stillfurther improved. The new Industrial Injuries Scheme, which as from 5th Julyentirely superseded the old Workmen&apos;s Compensation Scheme, has startedsmoothly. Special steps taken to explain the details to Trades Union officials and to employers have been well repaid.3. To launch the new schemes I had to set up a new organisation consistingessentially of a Central Record Office at Newcastle capable of handling theinsurance records of over 25 million people, and a network of some 1,000 local offices grouped under a regional organisation which had also to be created. this meant getting together a large staff, amounting now to about 39,000, and theacquisition of many premises. The staff had to be recruited from several sources.The nucleus was formed by taking over about 6,000 staff from the Ministry ofLabour and National Service and the old Health Insurance Departments. over,500 were taken over from&apos;the Approved Societies; about 1,500 were transferred from Local Authorities and about 3,400 were specially recruited as having previous* These figures do not include claims to unemployment benefit, which continue to be dealtwith at the Employment Exchanges.36452
2National Health or Workmen&apos;s Compensation experience outside the approved societies. The balance were obtained from various Civil Service sources orrecruited locally on a temporary basis. All this staff had to be posted to offices in various parts of the country and, as far as possible, given training in their new duties. Whitley machinery has been set up and has helped to ease many ofthe difficulties inherent in building up a new organisation on such a large scale.4. A large number of regulations, some of them of a very complicatedcharacter, had to be prepared, submitted to the National Insurance AdvisoryCommittee or the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council for approval, and laidbefore Parliament. The National Insurance Act in particular left many detains to be filled in by Regulations. The preparation and consideration of the regula-tions proceeded with very little friction, though one or two controversial onesare still only provisional and have yet to be finally approved.5. Simultaneously we had to make arrangements for carrying on the oldschemes. Some 6,000 Approved Societies had to be wound up and the work theyhad been doing had to be taken over. This had to be done without any breakin the continuity of payment of benefit and gave rise to some specially difficult problems during the period immediately before 5th July.6. I would like to record my appreciation of the help I have received fromother Departments. The local offices are the key to my organisation. They arethe point of contact with the public and their siting, appearance and suitabilityare of the utmost importance. The Minister of Works by great efforts managed to provide me with nearly a thousand offices; and if I must make reservations about some of them, it is not,because I underestimate the difficulty of findingsuitable premises, but because I must make it plain that there are still some places, especially in London, where the absence of suitable accommodation isgiving rise to a situation which may cause trouble if it is not speedily remedied.7. The Ministry of Labour have helped in many ways. In some cases wehave been able to share premises with them. They have given valuable assistance by undertaking much of the local work connected with the entry of the new classesinto Insurance and they carried out the exchange of the old insurance cards andu-neniployment books for the new National Insurance cards. The assistance board gave great help in the introduction as from October 1946 of the new retire-ment pensions. Payment of benefit through the Post Office has thrown on that department a heavy burden of work which has been carried out without&apos;a hitch.The Stationery Office has responded wholeheartedly to very large demands forprinting and equipment.8. I have also been very favourably impressed with the attitude of all con-cerned with the transfer from the Approved Societies. Many of them werebitterly opposed to the decision to exclude the Societies from the working of thenew scheme; but once Parliament had decided the issue they ail co-operated tothe full in the difficult task of carrying this transfer through. The result hasbeen that difficult and complicated negotiations and arrangements, which mighthave given rise to a lot of trouble, went very smoothly; they included the writingup and handing over of past insurance records and the transfer of many thousands of staff and of assets running into millions of pounds.9. The registration of new entrants has gone well. For various reasons it is difficult to give a precise estimate of the extent to which people have complied with their new obligations. The absence of recent census figures makes it difficultto estimate the total population affected. The fact that self-employed or non- *employed people can claim exception if their incomes are under  104 a yearprobably means that many of the people who have not registered could get excep-tion if they applied for it, and it would be pedantic to regard them as defaulters.Making the best estimate I can, and I do so with reserve, I am reasonably satisfiedthat about 98 per cent, of those liable to pay contributions under the new schemehave registered. It is even more difficult to form any idea of the extent to whichpeople are actually paying the new contributions week by week. Surveys so farmade indicate that the standard of compliance by employers is most satisfactory,notwithstanding the substantial increases in the rates of contributions. A definite conclusion about compliance by self-employed and non-employed persons must await the first exchange of contribution cards under the new scheme; but enquiriesso far made suggest that, though there is undoubtedly a. tendency not to stamp
the cards week by week, contributions will in general be paid up to date beforethe time comes for the card to be exchanged. There is no evidence at all of any widespread, deliberate defiance of the provisions of the Scheme.10. So far we have been fortunate in that there has been no unusual amountof sickness. Claims to sickness benefit have been coming in at about or ratherbelow the estimated rate. We must, however, expect a seasonal increase in thenext few months. This will be a testing time for the new organisation. If theincrease is no more than normal I do not   expect serious difficulties. But if .anything like an epidemic should occur the pressure on my staff may become veryserious. An epidemic would have the double effect of increasing the number of claims and at the same time reducing the staff available to deal with them. a situation might develop calling, if only temporarily, for drastic relaxations toenable the work to be carried on.11. The possibility of setting up a comprehensive system of morbiditystatistics is being examined with the Departments concerned. Their value will depend on the accuracy of medical certification. From every point of view it isclear that the satisfactory working of the new schemes will depend on reliablemedical certification and this is a point which will have to be watched.12. For the Industrial Injuries Scheme a comprehensive system of MedicalBoards had to be set up. This was done in close co-operation with the Ministryof Pensions and to a large extent premises and doctors are shared. Claims to industrial injury benefits have been coming in at about the expected rate, but inthe main they have been dealt with by payments at the flat rate of 45s. injurybenefit. There has been no criticism of this rate, but it remains to be seen whetherthe disability pension based on the degree of disability instead of loss of earningpower will be equally well received. So far only a small number of claims todisablement benefit have come before the medical boards for assessment.13. The fact that there has not been any abnormal increase in the numberof claims to sickness or industrial injury benefit does not dispose of the questionwhich the Minister of Labour and I were asked by the Cabinet on 9th december to investigate (CM. (48) 79th Conclusions, Minute 6), namely, whether the new rates of benefit are leading to any increase in involuntary absenteeism. I haveno evidence that they are, but the enquiry is proceeding.14. The retirement condition for pension came in for some criticism in theearly days. It is beginning to be better understood and on the whole the admiriis-tration of the condition has given rise to less trouble than might have been expected. A surprisingly high proportion of people (over 60 per cent, of men)who might retire and draw a pension are continuing at work after pension age;though for how long they continue is not yet clear. It remains to be seen whetherincrements for delayed retirement will induce people to remain in regular work.From the man-power point of view this is a much more important issue thanwhether the earnings rule discourages a few of them from taking an occasionalodd job.15. Considerable progress has been made with reciprocity agreements withother countries inside and outside the Commonwealth. Complete reciprocal arrangements exist with Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man covering both national Insurance and Industrial Injuries. An agreement on sickness and maternity benefit has been made with Eire and negotiations are proceeding foragreements relating to unemployment benefit and seamen. A reciprocal arrange-ment covering family allowances has been made with New Zealand and negotia-tions for further agreements with that country are pending. Discussions Ravealso been opened with Australia and Canada regarding various parts of theschemes. In pursuance of the policy laid down by the Treaty of Brussels anagreement has been signed between Great Britain and France covering insurance against sickness, old age and death (including widowhood, orphanhood and deathgrant, payments in respect of the confinement of women and insurance againstindustrial accidents and diseases. Preliminary discussions have take place withHolland and steps have been taken to open similar negotiations with Belgium and luxembourg.16. Six months is a very short period on which to found an estimate of the reception and effects o f such far-reaching schemes.   My impression is that they

Six months is a very short period on which to found an estimate of the reception and effects of such far-reaching schemes.  My impression is that they
have been well received; there is certainly no organised opposition. The noveltyof some of the new benefits and of the conditions attached to them has not un-naturally caused some misunderstanding and indeed concern. The position of married women under the new schemes, the new maternity and widows&apos; benefits andthe payment of the relatively high contributions by part-time workers have, forexample, given rise to a certain amount of difficulty. On the other hand, the newdependency allowances attached to sickness benefit and the better provisions forwidowed mothers have been widely welcomed; the other benefits will no doubt alsobe increasingly appreciated as they get better known. The local office systemseems to be popular and people like the idea of an office to which they can bring their troubles. Since 5th July we have had over 12^ million callers, and indeed the number of people who continue to call at our offices constitutes a problem.Payment through the post is decidedly popular and it is only in a few localitiesthat any considerable number of claimants call at the office for their money.Requests for payments in cash at the home are negligible; I think this disposesof one of the arguments for the old approved society system, namely, that peopleliked having agents bringing the money to the home. Some points of detail are beginning to show themselves where modifications will probably be required andit may be necessary to introduce amending legislation to deal with them, but nothing has yet happened to suggest that any major recasting of the schemes willbe necessary. From the administrative point of view we need a period of relativequiet during which the procedures and administrative arrangements which neces-sarily had to be &quot;put into production from the drawing board&quot; can be re-examined in the light of experience. The successful administration of theschemes clearly depends on the development of the local office system and furtherdecentralisation is desirable, for example, in the administration of pensions and family allowances. A scheme which sets out, as our new scheme does, to deal indetail with a wide variety of the needs of the individual is bound to be expensiveto administer. Current trends are in the direction of still further differentiationto meet the various contingencies of life. Some economies of staff should bepossible as our officers become better trained and procedure is simplified in thelight of experience. But no very great economy will be possible if we have to give way to the pressure in favour of still further extension of special treatment forspecial classes of contributors.J.
