THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF  HIS  iBRITANNIC  MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1949SECRET GoPy No*  3 1CP. (49) 202nd February, 1949CABINETWAR GRAVESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for WarI wish to bring to the notice of the Cabinet a difficulty which has arisenregarding the determination of the final burial place for mixed remains or ashesof British and American dead. The question arises in regard to (a) intermingledashes in mass graves in Japan, and (b) certain cases of mixed and separatelyunidentifiable remains (mostly resulting from aircraft crashes) in various partsof the world.2. The Americans originally asked for agreement to the shipment to theUnited States of the ashes of all Allied dead in mass graves in Japan, on theground that United States Public Law 383 (1946) called for the return to theUnited States of American World War II dead, including all unidentifiableremains. In the case of British war dead, on the other hand (this applies toall cases where death occurred before 1st January, 1948), the policy has been to refuse any permission for repatriation to this country, whether at public or private expense.3. The Foreign Office, after consulting the Imperial War Graves Commis-sion, informed the American Embassy that we could not agree to their request,and the Americans then made fresh proposals. They suggested either (a) that this group of intermingled ashes should be interred in the nearest permanent UnitedStates military cemetery to be established at some future date in the Pacific area,or (6) that where the ashes of British dead predominated they should be interredin a cemetery selected by the British Government and where American ashespredominated in one selected by the United States Government. Proposal (a)was not considered acceptable : it would have removed all the British dead,probably to a distant location like Guam or Luzon, taken them outside our control and afforded no guarantee against subsequent transfer to the UnitedStates. The Imperial War Graves Commission, after ccnsulting the other commonwealth Governments represented on the Commission, were willing toaccept (b), but the Service Ministers, on the advice of their Principal PersonnelOfficers, thought that agreement should be conditional on consultation with thenext-of-kin of those concerned, and that in the event of disagreement by anynext-of-kin, the bodies should remain in the nearest British or American militarycemetery in the theatre of operations concerned. The Foreign Office accordinglyreplied making this stipulation.4. The Americans have replied that they cannot accept the stipulation thatBritish next-of-kin should be consulted, as they contemplate no such action inthe case of American next-of-kin. The matter has thus reached a deadlock andafter further discussion both the Foreign Office and the Principal PersonnelOfficers of the three Services now recommend that we should waive the stipulationand agree to the American proposal.5.   I appreciate that there are strong arguments for doing so.    the americans, on their side, in spite of their law, have agreed to leave their deadundisturbed in cases where there are a greater number of British dead in a.36524,
communal grave, and it will put us in an invidious position vis-a-vis American opinion if it appears that we are obstructing the repatriation of American wardead to the United States. We are also hoping to obtain American agreement to our point of view on other aspects of policy, to which we attach importance,such as the question of the return of United States dead to British next-of-kinin this country. Nevertheless it seems to me that, politically, we are likely tomeet with severe criticism when it becomes known that, while refusing to allow any British war dead to be repatriated to the United Kingdom, we have agreedto the Americans removing British remains to the United States without anyconsultation with the next-of-kin. The fact that the number of British deadaffected would be relatively few there are 19 in the main grave in Japan whereAmericans predominate, 71 Americans and 10 Dutch will not prevent the volumeof protest being considerable. The many letters we receive in the War Office onthe subject of graves and remains show how strong are the feelings aroused by such questions.6. The American proposal in itself is a natural and reasonable one andI and the other Service Ministers have no doubt that we ought to fall in with it. I hope also that, when we explain the reasons for it fully to the public,we shall receive the acquiescence of public opinion. Constitutionally, the questionis one which ought to be decided by the Imperial War Graves Commission,which of course I am Chairman, in the light of the views of the governments represented on the Commission, and the question to be settled is the attitude ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government to the proposal, for communication to the Commission.7. I shall be glad to know whether, in the circumstances, the Cabinet agreethat the American proposal should be accepted.E. S.War Office, S.W.1,2nd February, 1949.
