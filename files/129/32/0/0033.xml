SfHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC majesty&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  February i949SECRET copy No^lCP. (49) 3817th February, 1949CABINETSUPPLY OF PAPER FOR ELECTIONS AND POLITICAL PARTIESMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade my colleagues may care to know of recent changes in the allocation of paper for general and local elections and for political parties.2. In view of the need to conserve the use of paper there has been an agree-ment between the Board of Trade and the various political parties to limit theamount of paper consumed for general and local elections and for politicalpublications.(a) For the General Election of 1945 there was a standard allowance foreach candidate, varying With the size of the electorate, plus an allowance for the headquarters of each party.(&amp;) Arrangements for supplies of paper for local elections were first madein 1945 and were broadly on the same basis as was used for theGeneral Election, allowing for the different size of the electorate.These arrangements have been adapted from time to time to meet theneeds of the different local elections. Headquarter allocations for thelocal elections which take place this spring were settled broadly onthe same lines. As in the case of the General Election, allowances of paper were made to the principal political parties for generaluse. Local candidates&apos; quotas were on the .basis of 1 cwt. per2,500 electors. Non-party candidates and candidates of parties with no headquarters&apos; quota were allowed an extra  -cwt. For rural district and Parish Councils these quotas were 28 lb. in respect ofevery 600 electors, while non-party candidates and candidates of parties with no headquarters&apos; quota were allowed an additional 7 lb.3. Some additional paper has been made available regularly to political parties for educational and propaganda work. Up to March, 1946, this quantitywas calculated as a percentage of their usage in a pre-war reference period; fromthat date it was recalculated primarily on the basis of the number of votes castat the General Election.4. Periodicals published by any of the parties are dealt with separatelyon the same basis as all other publications. As from 1st Ma the allocationfor periodicals is 45 per cent, of the amount used in the year (id 31st August,1939, and the size for newspapers generally /is from 5 to 8 pt^es per issue fordailies, and 6 to 8 pages for weeklies.5. After 6th March individual licensing of paper will be largely discon-tinued and political organisations will be free, with certain exceptions, to obtainand use whatever quantity of paper they wish without restrictions (other thanthat of price control) within the supplies generally available. The exceptionsrelate to newsprint, which continues to be the subject of detailed licensing as hitherto [this does not affect the political parties materially in so far as their general printing is concerned], and to the consumption of paper generally for36588
newspapers, periodicals, magazines and news bulletins, which remain limited by Statutory Order. In so far as paper for the local elections which take placein the spring of this year is required after 6th March, it will be freely available and not subject to the restrictions described in paragraph 2 (6) above.6. No limitation was imposed on the amount of paper which might be usedfor the Northern Ireland election which took place on 10th February.7.   I propose to announce these arrangements shortly in the House-.H W.Board of Trade, S.W. 1,17th February, 1949.
