THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT      /-    245Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1949SECRET Copy No. 31CP. (49) 28\5th February, 1949CABINETWAGE MOVEMENTS IN 1948Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service(Note. This paper was prepared before the recent proposals of the Agricultural. Wages Board were announced and is circulated as originally drafted. the implications of the Agricultural Wages proposals are being examined inthe light of the conclusions of the Production Committee of 23rd November(P.C. (48) 23rd Meeting, Minute 5) on the subject of a wages structure inagriculture).THE annex to this memorandum examines the main features of the changesin wages which have taken place in 1948. In the notes below I have attempteda general appreciation of the position we have reached and the future trends.2. In January 1948, when I circulated to the Cabinet my memorandum on past and Prospective Wage Movements (CP. (48) 27), a general wages movementhad been in progress since mid-1947 and was well under way at the beginningof February, 1948, when the White Paper on Personal Incomes, Costs and Prices(Cmd. 7321) was issued. Naturally, the publication of the White Paper didnot and could not have been expected to bring the movement to an abrupt end.There was a general acceptance of the view that, on grounds of equity and fairdealing, claims that had reached an advanced stage of negotiation at the timeof the issue of the White Paper, or were pending, could not be dealt with strictlyon the lines of the White Paper; a transitional period was required for adjust-ments. In fact, therefore, the movement has continued, although on a muchmodified scale and at a reduced rate during the greater part of 1948. It should,however, in my view, be regarded as having been completed with the majorsettlement in the engineering industry following the Court of Enquiry whichI appointed in August, 1948, and it is important that industry generally should regard it as having been so completed. Nothing should be done that might create a contrary impression, otherwise a new wage cycle might be impossible to avoid.3. It was inevitable that when the White Paper was issued negotiations in a number of important industries were found to be almost nearing completion.The most important in this respect were the London Road Transport claim andthe claims in the Printing Industry. In the former, London Transport executive had already made an offer of 7s. 6d. and in the latter a document had just been drawn up on the basis of an earlier award by the National Arbitration Tribunal.The settlement reached in those two cases attracted a good deal of attention andwithout doubt set a standard for settlement of the other outstanding or pendingclaims.4. In the circumstances, the general results that have been achieved over theyear must be regarded as satisfactory. Many important industries have been involved and, in general, it can be said that on both sides there has been a readiness to co-operate with the Government in achieving the objectives of theWhite Paper. In securing the co-operation of the Trade Unions, the T.U.C.&apos;shelp has been invaluable; indeed, it was indispensable.  It is, of course, common36540 b
knowledge that the Communist Party have been openly hostile and have notonly encouraged wage claims but have actively campaigned to cause disturbancewhenever any pretext could be found. The White Paper policy has offered a readypoint of conflict on which to base these disruptive activities and it is therefore not only gratifying but highly significant that in the year 1948 the record ofworking days lost owing to trade disputes was 1,944,000, or approximately 500,000less than in 1947. Even these figures do not disclose the full significance of theresults. In fact, 98 per cent, of the population in civil employment were notinvolved in disputes, so that only 2 per cent, were involved, with an averageof five working days per head lost in the year.5. One consequence of the Communist Party&apos;s attack on the White Paperpolicy is that disputes over wage claims cannot be treated as purely industrial in character. They are characterised by attempts to damage the existing constitu-tional machinery and there is no doubt that the maintenance of a strong systemof responsible joint voluntary machinery is one of the major requirements forcombating this challenge successfully.6. Another result of the Communist attack is that wage claims are formu-lated by extremists. The Trade Union Executives cannot refuse to deal with claims properly authorised under the Union rules, but they can and do co-operate to see that they are dealt with constitutionally. The degree of success of theWhite Paper is not to be measured by the volume of wage claims that areformulated but by the settlements and the manner in which they are accepted.Even so, it would be fatal to our policy if in the course of reaching settlementsthere was room for any suggestion that the claims had not received adequateconsideration. If the impression gained ground that whatever the merits therewas no hope whatsoever of even a minor adjustment, to take account of cost ofliving increases for example, it would be difficult to maintain the present satisfac-tory position. This has a bearing upon the desirability of cost of living agree-ments. It is significant that in the building trade, where conditions are subjectto cost of living agreements, an increase of Is. lOrf. a week has been accepted without comment and this level of increase has spread throughout a number ofthe allied industries. In other industries, decreases have been accepted. Thesecost of &quot;living agreements have certain manifest disadvantages but it may bethat there are also important advantages by way of offset. It is, however, necessaryto note that an important section of the Trade Union Movement is opposed towhat they term a &quot; fodder &quot; basis.7. The increases granted under the immediate post-war settlements werenecessarily larger than those awarded in the war years. The amount of increasesawarded in 1948 showed a welcome decrease in the average but a further decreasein the amounts awarded under future settlements would have a still more beneficial effect.8. The following table shows how the average increase awarded has fallen in 1948. (Only the persons affected by the increases are included for the purposeof the calculation) : Weekly average increaseresulting from settlements in the year.s.   d.4 07 37 04   109. Another useful indication of the way wages moved in 1948 is afforded by the Wages Index. This went up eight points in 1946, five points in 1947, and four points in 1948, two of which occurred in the first quarter.10. It is clear that the price sanction contained in paragraph 10 of theWhite Paper has proved one of the most powerful deterrents for preventing wage increases. Industries subject to price control have clearly kept the provisionsof paragraph 10 well in mind and, where any wage increase was dependent ona corresponding increase of prices, that factor has influenced the course oi tneJuly-December 194519461947
negotiations. Industries not subject to price control, however, do not appear tohave indulged in extravagant settlements.   Examples are as follows : Motor Vehicle, Retail and Repair Trade; Shipbuilding; Brewing,Tobacco Manufacture, Building, Electrical Contracting, civil engineering.An examination of the settlements in these cases suggests that in generalthe lead provided by the main industries subject to some form of price control will determine the general treatment of claims. It does not seem likely that therewill be extravagant settlements in industries not subject to price control or thatthey will start an entirely independent wages movement.11. I must confess to certain apprehensions about the Retail Wages Councils.Their discussions suggest that their proposals may not be altogether in keeping with our ideas of the place which the industry should occupy in the generaleconomy. I have already felt it necessary to refer back the proposals of theHairdressing Wages Council and I may find it necessary to circulate a note on the proposals from the other Councils as they are submitted to me.12. A possible source of danger to the success of the White Paper policymay be the emphasis placed on wage increases to &quot; undermanned &quot; industries.The idea that substantial wage increases can be granted to an &quot; undermanned &quot;industry without disturbing the rest of the field does not seem to be borne outin practice and the direct incitement to wage claims which is caused by designat-ing an industry as &apos;&apos; undermanned &apos;&apos; gives rise to serious difficulties. cotton and Agriculture are two obvious examples. I think that for a number of reasons it would be desirable to avoid in future the use of the description &apos;&apos; under-manned &apos;&apos;; not least important being the effect which the employment of the termhas in stimulating embarrassing wage claims.13. The experience of 1948 shows that the questions of cost of living, prices,and profits are inextricably mixed up. If for any reason the Interim Index of retail Prices were to show a significant rise or if there was a marked increaseof profits or prices, there would be little likelihood of avoiding compensatoryWage increases or an outbreak of &amp;serious industrial unrest. On the other hand the most powerful aid to stabilisation would be a fall in the Interim Index of retail Prices. It must, however, be recognised that some claims are inevitable and, even though they may appear totally unreasonable and obviously Communistinspired, must receive proper consideration on their merits. Nothing should bedone at this juncture that might give rise to any impression that the contrarywill be the case. Nevertheless, while the general situation must continue torequire very careful handling, particularly in face of the Communist attack,the success so far achieved strengthens our hands in dealing with future claims.G.

Wage Rates from the end of the war to December, 1947. After theend of the war from mid-1945 to mid-1946 there was a rapid rise in weeklywage rates reflecting the conclusion of post-war settlements over the greater partof industry. This was followed by a year of comparative stability in weeklywage rates from mid-1946 to mid-1947. The rise in this period largely reflected the need for comparatively minor adjustments as between industries arisingfrom the major settlements in the early period. During this period also normal working hours in most industries were reduced from an average of about 4836540 B 2
to about 44 a week, without in most cases a reduction in the weekly rate ofwages. A second post-war wage movement started about mid-1947 and wage rates were increased in a considerable number of important industries betweenJuly 1947 and the end of that year. Details of these were given in an earlier memorandum circulated as CP. (48) 27.2. Wage Rate increases during 1948. The second post-war wage movementcontinued during 1948 and a statement of the more important industries in whichincreases became effective during 1948 is contained in Appendix I, Table 1. Thegreat majority of these increases can be considered as forming part of this secondpost-war movement, and from mid-1947 to the end of 1948 there was in effectan increase in wage rates over almost the whole of the industrial field. During1948 about seven and three-quarter million workers received increases representingan addition of  1,890,000* to the weekly wages bill. The comparable figures forthe years 1945, 1946 and 1947 wereTable 1Year affectedWorkers Net weekly1945194619471948increase 7,308,000 1,806,0007,980,000 2,901,3004,973,000 1,730,9007,760,000 1,890,0003. Appendix II gives details of the wage increases divided between the major industrial groups for the period January-December 1948.4. The Index figure of rates of wages which measures the movement in thelevel of full-time weekly rates in the principal industries and services as comparedwith the level at 30th June, 1947, taken as 100 has since that date risen asfollows : Table 2tIndex Rates of Wages, 100 = June 1947Date (end of month)	Men	Women	Juveniles	All Workers1947 June    ......	100	100	100	100September	101	101	102	101December	103	103	106	1031948 January-	104	104	106	104February	104	105	106	104March ...	105	107	107	105April   ......	105	107	108	105May    ......	105	107	108	105June    ......	105	107	108	i06July     ......	105	108	108	106August	106	108	109	106September	106	108	109	106October	107	109	109	107November	107	109	110	107December	107	109	110	107* The figures for 1948 are more comprehensive that the figures for earlier years and include certain groups of workers, e.g., shop assistants and Government employees who were not includedin the figures for earlier years.t The wage rate index is based on the recognised rates of wages fixed by collective agreement.The percentage increases in the various industries are combined in accordance with the relative importance of the industries as measured by the total of the wages bill in 1946. This is a new Indexwhich has superseded the earlier one in which industries were weighted in accordance with the pre-warwages bill.
524?5. The figures given in the paragraphs above and an examination of theactual settlements in a number of important industries indicate that the increases in wage rates during the general movement which has been taking place since junly 1947 are comparable to the increases resulting from the immediate post-war wage settlements of 1945-46. In general, however, the major wage settlementssince the first quarter of 1948 have tended to provide more limited wage increasesthan in the immediate post-war settlements or than in the settlements of thepreceding nine months.6. Rise, in Average Earnings: The memorandum on wages movementsprepared in January 1948 gave a table of the percentages by which average earnings in industry had risen between 1938 and April 1947. Since that memo-randum was prepared the results of two further earnings enquiries are available,,for October 1947 and April 1948, and the table brought up to date to include,these figures is in Appendix III.The results of the earnings enquiries for October 1947 and April 1948 suggestthat earnings have risen more rapidly than wage rates. In the twelve months ifrom April 1947 to April 1948 the percentage increase in average earnings roseby 20 as compared with the figure for 1938 (Le., from 194 to 214, taking 1938as 100). This relatively greater rise in earnings is probably due in part to the reductions of the normal working week (see paragraph 8 below) which resulted inincreases in the hourly rates and in overtime earnings.7. Significant Features of the Wages Movements during 1948. There are several features of the wages movement from mid-1947 to December 1948 whichare pf special interest.(a) Repercussions of Important Wage Settlements. The wage settlements in industries of major importance have tended to determine settlements in anumber of other less important industries which are in effect related to themain industry, at any rate for purpose of wage settlement. Two examples areengineering and building. The wage increase of 5s. a week in engineering which followed the report of the Committee of Enquiry in August 1948 was followedby settlements providing for increases of 5s. a week in shipbuilding, brass found-ing, wagon-building, light metal trades and plastic material trades. The costof living agreement in the building industry resulted in the middle of the year in an increase of Is. lOrf. per week. In a number of industries, including civil engineering, demolition contracting, domestic engineering (lighting and heating)and asphalt, which do not have cost Of living agreements, increases of Is. lOd. aweek were agreed during the period following the date at which the cost of livingagreement became effective in building.(b) Relative Movements of Wages. As can be expected at a time whenwages generally are not stabilised, the relations between wage rates in different industries are subject to frequent change and the relativities which existed whenthe memorandum CP. (48) 27 was prepared at the end of 1947 have not in allcases been maintained. Appendix IV contains tables illustrating (i) minimum wage rates for men and women in selected industries in 1939, 1947 and 1948; and(ii) average earnings of men and women in selected industries in 1938, 1947 and1948. During 1948 wage rates in many of the less essential industries haveimproved relatively to wages in such important industries as coalmining, agricul-ture and textiles. These industries are, however, still in a much more favourable position than they were before the war and the recent change in the relation between wage rates in them and in other industries is not of great significance.(c) The tendency for the lower paid workers to receive relatively greaterincreases which was noted in CP. (48) 27 has continued. While the wage rateIndex for all workers has risen by 7 points since June 1947, the rise for women,has been 9 points and for juveniles 10 points. Similarly, while average weekly earnings in April 1948 for all workers were 114 per cent; above 1938, thepercentage rise for men was only 94 per cent.; for women it was 124 per cent., foryouths under 21 119 per cent, and for girls under 18 161 per cent. In general it is true also that amongst the men the position of the unskilled workers has improved in relation to the skilled. Many settlements have provided for anall-round flat increase. In a few cases while the wage rates have been raisedprovision has also been made that workers receiving wages above the increasedstandard rate should not receive equivalent increases. The tendency is a gradualone, mainly no doubt because industries rightly must avoid particular settlementsprejudicing essential features of their wages structure.
(d) General Revision of Wages Structures. Increasing attention has been directed to the revision of wages structures in a number of major industries. Thisis no doubt in part due to the problems arising from the tendency mentioned in(c) above and from the problems caused by the short-term wage settlements ofthe war period. Post-war developments in certain industries have also led tothe present being thought a convenient and appropriate time to undertake suchrevisions. A general revision of wages was agreed in the railways in February1948. Settlements following on the recommendations of the Evershed commission have resulted in a fairly general revision in cotton spinning. In cotton weavingthe industry has begun what will be a difficult and complicated revision of itswages structure following the report of the Moelwyn Hughes Commission. Pro-longed discussions on the subject of the revision of wages structure are continuingin the engineering industry, the Court of Enquiry in August having recommended to this effect. Discussions are also proceeding about the revision of wages structure in the printing industry. This is a matter which may also prove important incoalmining and in agriculture.(e) Cost-of-Living Agreements. Before June 1947 about seventy-fiveindustries employing nearly two and half million workers operated agreementsproviding for the adjustment of wage rates in accordance with movements of theold Cost-of-Living Index. Since the new Interim Index of Retail Prices replacedthe old Index in June 1947 about thirty industries have negotiated new agree-ments providing for wage adjustments in accordance with the Interim Index.The total number of workers affected is between one and a quarter and one and a half million, the most important industries being building, boot and shoe and ironand steel.(/) Frequency of Claims. During the latter months of 1948 a number of claims were presented in industries in which there had been important wage settlements earlier in the year. The most important were in railways, wherethere had been a general revision of wages in February, and road passenger transport, where substantial claims had been settled in March and April. In anumber of less important industries claims have also been presented within ashort period of earlier settlements.8. Reduction of the Normal Working Week. During 1948 the weekly hoursof work of 616,000 workers were reduced by an average of about 3 hours each.The reductions which have taken place in the last four years are shown in thefollowing table : Table 3Approximate averagereduction of hours per weekaffecting the number of Number of workers affectedYear. workers in column (3) by reductions in column (2)(1) (2)                                        (3)1945 ...... 2                                22,0001946 ...... 2f                           2,128,0001947 ......

Holidays with Pay. There are indications that unions are directingtheir attention to securing an increase in holidays with pay rather than further reductions in the normal working week. A number of industries (includingLaundries, Food Trades and Chemical Trades) have adopted two weeks&apos; holidaywith pay (in addition to the six statutory holidays). Other industries, includingcoalmining and the clothing trades, have presented claims during recent months.As yet the provision of two weeks&apos;1 paid holiday is not general throughout industry, the most usual provision being for statutory holidays and six or ninedays&apos; additional holidays with pay.
Effects of the White Paper on Personal Incomes, Costs and Prices10. The Government statement made on 4th February, 1948, and laterpublished as a White Paper, has not prevented a very considerable number ofwags increases during the year. During the months immediately before the issueof the statement many industries of major importance had received wage increases and at the time the statement was made negotiations on wage claims were proceeding in many industries, in some of which the employers concerned were committed to giving some increase. It was clear that negotiations which had started before 4th February could not be broken off because of the publicationof the White Paper without serious damage to industrial relations. In manyindustries notification of wage claims had been made before the beginning ofFebruary and in these cases it was not possible for employers to refuse negotia^-tions. In addition, there were industries such as engineering in which there were quite special circumstances. In the engineering industry negotiations about the revision of the wages structure had been proceeding for a considerable time andthe Unions consequently did not present their claim for an all-round wage increase until 18th February. When the matter was considered by a Court of inquiry the Court felt that these circumstances warranted their taking jtheclaim into their consideration. Apart from difficulties of this kind the factthat a considerable number of industries received increases shortly before orimmediately after the issue of the White Paper made it impossible for tradeunions in other industries not to put forward their claims and so leave the workersthey represented in a relatively unfavourable position in consequence of a time factor over which they had no control.11. There is reason to think that the wage increases accepted have probably been more moderate than they would have been if the statement had not beenissued. It is not possible to produce definite evidence in support of this viewbut it is clear from the arguments used during wage negotiations that the state-ment has influenced the attitude of both sides of industry. Employers were increasingly reluctant to agree to wage demands, particularly in those industries where the price sanction in paragraph 10 of the White Paper could be made effective and where the existing margin of profit was not great. Workers&apos; repre-sentatives were more prepared to accept moderate increases having regard to the expressed view of the Government as to the needs of the general economic situa-tion and the support given to the Government by the T.U.C. The action takenin regard to dividends has also been important in influencing their attitude.The publication of the White Paper and subsequent Government statements andthe restraint shown by industry in the matter of dividends has certainly been ofassistance to workers&apos; representatives in persuading the rank and file of the dangers of pressing claims for excessive increases.Future Trends12. Outstanding Claims. A list of the more important claims for wage increases outstanding at the end of the year is given in Appendix I, Table 2.The presentation of several major claims in recent months makes it clear thatthere can be no guarantee of even relative stability in the immediate future. this general position must remain finely balanced at least until the cost of living begins to come down.13. The key position of agriculture in the wages field is known. In spiteof the general recognition of the greatly increased importance of agricultureas compared with pre-war, and the fact that the pre-war attitude as to the relationship between agricultural wages and wages in other industries has changed, there is a very serious danger that an increase in the agriculturalminimum rate will result in claims for higher wages in other industries,particularly in a number of rural industries and trades where in the past therehas been a close relationship with agriculture. It is significant that a claim forincreased wages is being submitted on behalf of County Council roadmen,apparently in anticipation of an increase in the agricultural minimum rate andin spite of the fact that an earlier claim for a wage increase was rejected bythe National Arbitration Tribunal as recently as October 1948.14. The consequences of a substantial, increase in the wage rates of railways,and of meeting the busmen&apos;s claim for time and a half pay on Saturday afternoons]would also be serious. In both cases there are a number of factors to beconsidered.   In both industries there have been very recent wage settlements.
railways received an all-round increase of 7s. Gd. per week in July 1947 (following a Court of Enquiry) and further increases following the revision of the wagesstructure in the railways in February 1948. Road passenger transport workersreceived wage increases in settlements reached in February and March 1948.Both groups of workers have thus received increases since the publication of theWhite Paper. It is significant also that in both claims the argument has beenput forward that the claims are not new but that they revive parts of the earlierclaims which were not secured, and that to some extent both claims have beenput forward as a result of pressure from the more extreme elements in the indus-tries concerned. The railway claim has been presented by the National Unionof Railwaymen without the support of the other two Railway Unions. A settle-ment of either claim which resulted in a substantial increase of wages, besidesleading to claims in other sections of the transport industry, would, in thesecircumstances, be likely to have widespread and serious repercussions in industry as a whole. The omnibus workers&apos; claim would, in addition, stimulate demands from workers in public utilities, shops and services whose working conditionsentail their employment during week-end periods.15. These three claims have been mentioned as examples of the generaldifficulties likely to be caused by settlements in particular industries, but settle-ments resulting in substantial wage increases of some of the other claims out-standing would also have repercussions. Wage increases in coalmining, building,brick-making and the food industries would affect considerable numbers of workers and would be likely to lead to claims in other industries.16. Cost-of-Living. A sudden rise in the Index of Retail Prices, probably more than any other single factor, would lead to the strongest pressure throughout industry for wage increases; a continuation of the gradual rise which has takenplace since mid-1947 will make it extremely difficult for industry to maintainwage stability for any reasonable period. The cost of living is the argumentmost frequently used in wage negotiations and high prices, so far as can be judged,are the most common justification amongst workers for their wage demands.It is equally true, however, that a decrease in the cost of living should havebeneficial results.* 17. Other Factors. There are a number of other factors which may proveimportant in influencing future developments in wages.(a) Dividends. The response by industry to the Government&apos;s appeal forthe stabilisation of dividends has been a valuable influence in moderat-ing demands for wage increases. If continued it would no doubt bea useful stabilising element, though its influence will tend to become less strong in the wages field. Certainly any substantial departure from the policy would most seriously weaken the effect of an appeal for continued stability in the wages field.(6) Individual Employers. The continuing shortage of labour results incertain employers paying wages above and observing terms andconditions of employment better than the generally recognised terms and conditions of employment in their industry. The practice is adopted not only in private industry but by local authorities. Actionof this kind increases the difficulties of both trade unions and employers in maintaining stability but is likely to continue so longas present economic conditions with a high demand for labour prevails.The sure remedy is an increase in organisation on both sides and strictadherence to collective agreements.(c) Communists. The policy of the Communists in the Trade Union move-ment is from time to time a serious disturbing factor. In some casesthe extreme element succeeds, given favourable circumstances, in securing the presentation of claims; in others where circumstances arenot so favourable they can always succeed in causing pressure to bebrought by the rank and file on the Trade Union representatives tosubmit claims and increase the difficulties of the Trade Union repre-sentatives in exercising a moderating and restraining influence.18. Paragraphs 12 to 17 summarise the possible sources of disturbance inthe wages field in the immediate future which, in certain circumstances, might cause a further general upward movement of wages. There are, however, stabilis-ing factors in the present situation which are of considerable importance but
the force of which it is extremely difficult to assess. Government statements onthe economic situation, particularly in its relation to the policy set out in the.White Paper on Personal Incomes, Costs and Prices, have established a general acceptance of the need for stability in wages to avoid inflation. This acceptanceof a general principle is, however, easily reconciled with a widespread feeling that exceptions can be fully justified in particular cases. It is felt also that prices and profits could be strictly limited more appropriately and justly thanwages. The effect of the publication of the White Paper naturally diminisheswith time and with each successive wage increase there is evidence of this inthe nature of the reference to it in the course of recent wage negotiations anda number of major wage increases in the immediate future would destroy mostof its remaining general influence. On the other hand the continued applicationof the price sanction announced in paragraph 10 will influence employers in those industries in which it can be applied and will have a moderating influence.Employers&apos; resistance to claims on this ground, however, would be harmful to industrial relations unless the workers and their trade union representativescontinue to accept the general principles of the White Paper.19. There is no evidence that the movement for reduced weekly hours ofwork is likely to be renewed and a period of stability can be expected in this field assuming that a high level of employment continues. (The pressure forlonger paid holidays seems, however, likely to continue.)20.
