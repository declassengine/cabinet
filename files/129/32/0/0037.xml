llltill W^m^m^iTHIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S EC RET    - iCP. (u10) 57 COPY NO,21ST FEBRUARY, 19h9CABINETNORTH ATLANTIC PACTNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs it has been&apos; proposed, in the Committee of representa-tives of the seven Governments in Washington that at the timeof the signature of the North Atlantic Pact a declaration should be.issued by as many as possible of the signatoriesemphasising the importance they attach to the security ofcertain countries, notably Italy (if she does not sign the pact), Greece, Turkey and possibly Iran.      I have recentlydiscussed with the Turkish Foreign Minister an important question which has arisen in this connection, namely, whether such a declaration, unless very carefully drafted, might not&apos; weaken rather than strengthen the position of Turkey.2. Turkey already enjoys the advantages of a firm commitment on the part of the United Kingdom (and theoreticallyof France also) to go to her aid in the case of aggressionunder the Treaty of Mutual Assistance of 19th October, 1939.She also enjoys at present the practical advantages of theTruman declaration of 12th March, 1947s in which the Presidentproclaimed the interest of the United States in Turkish and greek security.      It is clear that in certain circumstances a somewhat weak and indefinite declaration on the part of the signatories of the Atlantic Pact, unless accompanied by somereaffirmation of the existing commitments, might appear to qualify the force of these commitments.3. The draft for the declaration which we have proposedto the Ambassadorial Committee in Washington will be found inthe Annex. This is probably as far as any of the signatory &apos;powers would be prepared to go in regard to Turkey and Greece,and there is some unwillingness on the part of the French andthe Canadians to sign it even in its present form. Its mainadvantages from the point of vlevf of the Turks and Greeks. would be-t -(a) that, whereas the Truman declaration was merely an expression of the President^ opinion and binding on him only, this would form part of the north atlantic Pact and would have the approval of congress;(b) &apos; that it would (we- hope) be signed by Canada and other signatories of the Atlantic Pact and would thuswiden the sphere of interest in Turkibh and Greeksecurity.4. There remains, of course, the need to a\oid weakeningthe force of the&apos; Anglo-French-Turkish Treaty of 1939.      It issuggested that this difficulty could be met by His majesty&apos;s government making some public statement at the time of the signature of the Pact to the effect that the 1939 Treatyremains, so far as they are concerned,&apos; fully in force.

5. It is not likely that the French would be willing tomake a similar declaration since they.are known to be reluctant to admit that their commitments to Turkey of 1939 are stillbinding, and they would almost certainly be unwilling to reaffirm them.I therefore recommend:-   .that we should stick to tt; &apos; draft declaration inthe Annex;that we should inform the United States Governmentthat v/e would be willing, at the time of signature of the Pact, to reaffirm British obligations underthe Anglo-Turkish Treaty of 1939;that we should also suggest to the United StatesGovernment that it would be helpful to Turkish and greek- opinion if they could find some means ofmaking it clear that the declaration, far fromweakening or qualifying President Truman1^declaration of interest in Turkey and Greece, infact places this on a firmer and more formal basis as part of a Treaty approved by Congress.;that in the light of the above we should do our best to persuade the French and Canadian (and other participating) Governments to sign the declarationas it stands;Fo B.Foreign Office, S.W.1.21 ST FEBRUARY,  19*4-9.(a)(b)(c)
