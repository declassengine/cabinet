SECRETCP. (49) 1015TH JANUARY.  1949CABINETPALESTINEMemorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign AffairsThe present position in Palestine is as follows.(a) The Jews have developed an organisation and moralesuperior to that of the Arabs and now have better armament.While in public statements the Jews claim that the general assembly Resolution of November, 1947, is still their main objective, they evidently also wish to expand that decisionto take Western Galilee and Jaffa as well into the jewish state and they would also like to have Jerusalem.      The con-continuation of the war is imposing a considerable strain ontheir financial and economic structure but there is no clear evidence that this is likely to prove decisive in the nearfuture.     Their political orientation will be shown inelections due to take place on 25th January.      It seems unlikely on present information that there will be any largeimmediate swing to the extreme Left, but it is clear that,with the strong international support which Russia has given,the dependence of the Jews on satellite war material and the -large number of immigrants from Eastern Europe, that Russianchances of establishing influence in the Jewish State are vesyconsiderable.      But there is, of course, strong Americaninfluence pulling the other way and there are also strongtrading and economic links with the United Kingdom and western Europe.(b) The Arab States, with the exception in most respectsof Transjordan, are passing through a difficult period.      Theyare thoroughly disillusioned about the prospects of inter-national collaboration through the United Nations and havebeen bitterly disappointed by American policy.      In spite ofthis, however, the position of the United Kingdom in the arab world is still good.      Although the Arab Governments havegiven us no support in reaching a satisfactory settlement, our efforts in this direction have nevertheless been respected.(c) Egypt!an-Jewish conversations are being carried proportionate Rhodes. Intermittent conversations between the Jews and transjordan Jordan are being carried on in Jerusalem.(d) The Conciliation Commission, composed of UnitedStates, French and Turkish representatives, after a preliminary meeting to take place at Geneva, was due to set itself up inJerusalem about the end of January, but there has been a lastminute hitch over the United States representative.      TheCommission&apos;s efforts will no doubt be confined, at leastinitially, to an attempt to bring the parties together indirect negotiations to seek a permanent settlement.COPY NO-3l;THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)

(e)    The United States Government will probablycontinue to use its influence with both sides with a viewto maintaining a cease-fire and bringing about discussions,and they hope for a successful outcome of the negotiations to be undertaken by the Conciliation Commission.As regards British policy -(a) Our policy is to support the decisions of theSecurity Council and other organs of the United nations and to use our influence to secure their observance and execution by both sides.(b) We have not opposed the creation of a jewish state and, by supporting the Bernadotte proposals, were recognised that the existence of such a state was anaccomplished fact.    Our policy has been based on thedesire that the state should be set up as soon as possiblein a reasonably homogeneous territory and in such a way as not to cause a continuation of chaos in the. middle east, i.e* we have sought a settlement including theexistence of a Jewish state in which the Arabs could resonably acquiesce and which they would not bend all their energies to undo.   We have made it clear that we will recognise and establish normal relations with theJewish State as soon as it is properly set up withdefined frontierst.   We suggested informally to the Jewsthat as a step towards recognition a British ConsularOffice might be set up in Tel Aviv.   The Jews replied thatthis was unacceptable to them unless accompanied by defacto recognition.(c) If there is no fresh disturbance of the peace and the present sets of discussions continue and areeventually taken over by the Conciliation Commission, no new major British initiative- will probably to required,but useful work can be done behind the scenes, particularly with the Arab countries,  towards the attainment of asettlement in v/hich they can properly acquiesce.   efforts are already being made to encourage Egypt, TransJordanand Iraq, the three Arab states principally concerned,to concert their policy with regard to negotiations fora final settlement.(d) Meanwhile, however, we cannot neglect takingthe necessary precautions to safeguard vital Britishinterests in the Middle East should fighting break outagain contrary to our hopes.E.B..Foreign Office, S.W.I.,15th January, 19^-9.

HISTORICAL MEMORANDUM ON THE SITUATIONIN PALESTINE SINCE 1945The Coalition Government gave consideration to theproblem of post-war policy in Palestine, but no decision wasreached at that time.      When the present Government took office, and at the moment when they were considering theirPalestine policy, the problem was further complicated bythe intervention of President Truman,, who wrote to thePrime Minister in August, 1945, suggesting the earlyadmission into Palestine of 100,000 Tewish displaced persons.2. It was impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to accede to this request, which caused disquiet throughout theArab world and which would have involved taking a majordecision on policy in Palestine before the future of thatcountry had been fully reconsidered in the light of post-war circumstances.     Tlr  situation in the Middle East atthe end of the war was such that at any moment there mighthave been a flare up.      The Palestine problem could not therefore be considered in isolation from the problems ofthe whole Arab world, as has too often been assumed.      Atthe same time it seemed desirable to associate the Americanswith ourselves, so far as possible, in the examination ofthe problem, in the hope that this would lead to agreementbetween the two Governments on the policy to be pursued.Accordingly I proposed&apos; to the Cabinet, on the 4th October,1945, that we should invite the United States Government tojoin us in appointing an.Anglo-American Committee ofEnquiry.      Agreement was reached on this course, and theCommittee presented their report to the two Governments inApril, 1946.3. The Cabinet decided that no public comment should bemade on the report by His Majesty&apos;s Government until we had consulted the United States Government.      On the 30th April,however, President Truman issued a statement in which he called for immediate action on one of the Committee&apos;s ten recommenda-tions, that which provided for the immediate authorisation of 100,000 immigration certificates, while announcing thathe would give &quot;careful study&quot; to the major politicalrecommendations.      It thus became necessary for the PrimeMinister to state,  in the House of Commons on 1st May, 1946,that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not agree to decide uponthe Committee&apos;s recommendations concerning immigration inadvance of their general decision on the report.    He also stated the Governments conclusions that they were not in aposition to give effect to.the Report.with their own financialand military resources alone, and that the disbandment and dis-armament of illegal military formations in Palestine would bean essential precondition to the admission of the 100,000immigrants.4. A few days later, during a conversation withMr.  Byrnes in Paris,  I suggested that American and Britishexperts should meet to study the implications of theCommittee&apos;s report, and if possible to make joint recommen-dations.      This suggestion vVas approved by the Cabinet, andthe United States Government sent a delegation of officialsunder the chairmanship of Mr.  Henry Grady to London,. where theynegotiated during June and July, 1946, with a British groupled by Sir Norman Brook.      This conference reached full agreement on a plan for provincial autonomy in Palestine,the original draft of which had been prepared in theColonial Office and submitted with Cabinet approval to theAmerican officials.

5. The officials also recommended that their proposals,if endorsed by the two Governments9  &quot;should be presented toArab and Jewish representatives as a basis for negotiations ata Conference to be convened by the United Kingdom Government&quot;.6. These recommendations were at once approved in        *principle-by His Majesty&apos;s Government.      President Trumandeclined to associate the United States Government with them.Nevertheless His Majesty&apos;s Government announced that theywould put forward the plan for provincial autonomy as abasis for discussion with ;-.arabs and Jews.7. The States members of the Arab League sent delega-tions to a conference in London which opened on the 9thSeptember, 1946.      The Jewish Agency for Palestine refused toparticipate except upon unacceptable conditions, the mostimportant of which was that the basis for discussion shouldbe &quot;the establishment of a viable Jewish State in an adequatearea of Palestine&quot;.     Negotiations with the Arabs wereinterrupted at the beginning of October, in order to permitcertain of the delegates to attend the United Nations general assembly, and to give time for His Majesty&apos;s Government to tryagain to secure Jewish participation.     When the Anglo-ArabConference resumed its work in January, 1947? representativesof the Jewish Agency engaged in parallel but informal con-versations with His Majesty&apos;s Government.8. The plan for provincial autonomy was emphaticallyrejected by both sides.      The Arabs made counter-proposals fora unitary independent State in Palestine, with a permanentArab majority but providing guarantees for the position of theJewish minority.      The Jewish representatives indicated that,if we were not prepared to place the whole of Palestine underJewish, sovereignty, their preference would be for a prolongation-tion of the Mandate, provided that all restrictions were removed from Jewish immigration and settlement.     Failing that,they would consider partition.9. Each of the solutions proposed by Arabs or jews would have involved the use of British forces to impose the will of one people in Palestine upon the other, and was con-sequently unacceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government.      it seemed, in fact, that there was no prospect that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment could bring about a settlement in Palestine except by the use of force on a scale which they were not prepared, to contemplate.    Together with the Colonial Secretary, therefore,I began to consid.er the alternative course of submitting theproblem to the United Nations.      Before this step was taken,however, I thought a final effort should be made to induceboth i.arabs and Jews to adopt a more conciliatory attitude, andwith this object I prepared a new set of proposals as a basis for further di s c US s ion with their representatives.      Briefly,this plan provided for a five-year period of trusteeship, to .be administered with the declared object of preparingPalestine for independence.      The trusteeship agreement wouldhave contained provision for the entry of 96,000 jewish immigrants during the first two years of its operation.Thereafter, if the High Commissioner was unable to determine the rate of immigration by agreement, the final decision would rest with an arbitration tribunal appointed by the united nations.10. On 7th February, 1947 (C*M.(47) 13th Conclusions,Minute 2)    the Cabinet authorised the presentation of theseproposals to the Arab and Jewish representatives.    They were immediately rejected by both.

11. It-was in these circumstances that the Cabinet took the decision which I announced, in the House of Commons onthe 18th February, in the following terms:&quot;The discussions of the last month have clearlyshown that there is no prospect of resolving thisconflict by any settlement negotiated between theparties.      But if the conflict has to be resolved by an arbitrary decision, that is not a decision which HisMajesty&apos;s Government are empowered, as mandatory, totake.    ...    We have therefore reached the conclusionthat the only course now open to us is to submit theproblem to the judgment of the United Nations.....We do not ourselves.intend to recommend any particularsolution. &quot;12. The General Assembly, meeting in special session inApril-May, 1947s appointed the United&apos;Nations SpecialCommittee on Palestine, with instructions to submit a report before the beginning of the regular session in September.Seven members of this Committee (representing Canada,Czechoslovakia, Guatemala, the Netherlands, Peru, Sweden andUruguay)  signed a majority report recommending a form of partition generally favourable to the Zionists.     A minorityreport, advocating a federal State in which the territorialdivision would be more satisfactory tc the Arabs, was signed by the representatives of India, Iran and Yugoslavia.      TheAustralian member did not associate himself with eitherproposal.13. When the recommendations of the Special Committeewere laid before the Assembly in the autumn of 1947, theUnited Kingdom Delegation were instructed to refrain fromexpressing any opinion as to the merits of either plan and to confine themselves to defining the limits of British partici-pation in implementing any policy which the Assembly might decide to recommend.      Accordingly,  on the 16th October,the Colonial Secretary told the Palestine Committee of theAssembly that &quot;if the Assembly should recommend a policywhich is not acceptable to the Jews and Arabs, some authority-alternative to the United Kingdom must.be provided in orderto implement the United Nations policy&quot;.      Subsequently, onthe 13th November, Sir Alexander Cadogan announced that theBritish military authorities had been instructed to plan forthe evacuation of troops to be completed by the 1st August,1948.      Despite these unequivocal warnings, the Assemblyendorsed a modified version of the UNSCOP majority plan onthe 29th November without recommending any means for itsenforcement.14. The failure of the Assembly to heed either Britishwarnings or Arab threats was fatal to the Commission which itappointed with the task of giving effect to the resolution ofthe 29th November.     Even before the termination of the   &apos;mandate and the withdrawal of British civil administration,which was to take place on the 15th may, 1948, civil war was developing in Palestine.      The Commission, which never- leftNew York, reported to the Security Council on the 16thFebruary that unless it was provided with means of enforce-ment it would not be able to discharge its responsibilities in Palestine  after the termination of the mandate.      TheCouncil&apos;s response to this report was to adopt a resolution,on the 1st April,&apos;requesting the Secretary General to conveneanother special session of the General Assembly.15. The Assembly finished its work on the 14th May byNew York time, a few hours after the termination of british rule in Palestine.      It resolved upon the appointment of aMediator, who was authorised to use his good offices in order

to bring about a peaceful settlement.     The resolution of theprevious November was neither repealed nor amended, but theMediator was not instructed to conform with.its terras oreven with its general principles in his search for a settle-ment.      The five permanent members of the Security Council,to whom the nomination of the Mediator was entrusted by theAssembly, agreed on the name of Count Bernadotte.16. Meanwhile, on the termination of the mandate, the armies of the Arab States crossed the frontier of Palestine5and came into conflict with Jewish forces.      On the 29th May,the Security Council called upon the Governments and author i-ties concerned &quot;to order a cessation of all acts of armed force for a period of four weeks&quot;, and decided that,  if itsresolution was rejected or subsequently violated by either party, action would be considered under Chapter VII of the charter.      In the circumstances this resolution, which wassponsored by the United Kingdom Delegation, amounted to a threat of sanctions against the Arab States.      (The text ofthe resolution is at Annex A).17. The truce came into effect on the 11th June.Before that date, His Majesty&apos;a Government had already com-plied with one of its provisions by placing a complete embargo on the supply of military material to Palestine and to all theArab countries, despite the fact that this embargo involved the suspension of important obligations arising from ourtreaties with Egypt, Iraq and Trans Jordan.18. When the truce expired early in July, the Arab Statesdeclined to renew it and fighting was resumed.      The truce was-established, however, by a resolution which the security council adopted on the 15th July (text at Annex A) f and which contained the threat of sanctions against any party failing toissue a cease-fire order within three days.      This threat also was in practice directed against the Arab.      The UnitedKingdom supported the resolution, and we brought strong pressure to bear upon the Arab States in order to secure their acquiescence.      The fighting ceased;    it was now pro-vided that the truce should remain in force until a defini-.tive settlement was reached;    and there were in fact no serious hostilities between July and October.19* The Mediator, who was charged by the Security council with the supervision of the truce, was at the same timeendeavouring to find a basis for a political settlement inaccordance with the Assembly&apos;s resolution of the 14th May.The general nature of his ideas was known from certain,preliminary proposals which he had unsuccessfully submittedto ;.arabs and Jews in June.      Discussions between the ForeignOffice and the State Department,  carried on in the light of this knowledge, revealed a large measure of agreement on the out-lines of a reasonable solution.      The main feature of this- .informal agreement, as of the Mediator&apos;s tentative proposals,was the partition of Palestine into two geographically corn-pact territories without enclaves and corridors instead ofalong the complicated lines recommended by the Assembly inNovember,  1947.      This involved the inclusion of the whole ofGalilee in the Jewish State, in exchange for the allocation of the Negeb to the Arabs.      On the 26th August the cabinet approved these suggestions and decided that, if an agreement onthese lines could be reached both with the United StatesGovernment and with the Mediator, the influence of HisMajesty&apos;s Government should be used to obtain the support of theUnited Nations as a whole for the resulting proposals(CP. (i+8) 207 and CM. (48) 57th Conclusions).

20. In September, just before the opening of theGeneral Assembly in Paris, Count Bernadotte submitted a reportcontaining suggestions for a settlement on the lines whichhad been anticipated.      It was agreed that Mr.  Marshall andI, in that order, would declare the support of our Govern-ments for what came to be known as the Bernadotte plan.(The text of Mr.  Marshall&apos;s statement is at Annex B. )Thereafter, the United Kingdom Delegation did their utmost to persuade the General Assembly to endorse the plan.     Wewere faced, however, not only by the determined opposition of both Arabs and Jews but also, after Mr.  Truman&quot;1 s re-election, by the withdrawal of the United States government from the position previously taken, I understood with the presidents approval, by Mr.  Marshall.      It now appeared thatthe United States Government, while recognising that thereshould be some compensation to the Arabs for the territory which the Jews had occupied over and above that awarded tothem in November, 1947, were not prepared to support any resolution -which would involve a modification of the Novemberfrontiers without Jewish consent.      In the end the Assembly&apos;transaction was confined to the appointment, on the 11th December,of a Conciliation Commission consisting of representatives of france , Turkey and the United States.- &quot; The Commission is tohold its first meeting in Geneva on the 1/th January, 1949*21. Meanwhile, on the 15th October, 1948, the JewishArmy launched an offensive against the Egyptians in southernPalestine.      Strengthened by the considerable quantities ofmilitary material, including aeroplanes, which they hadimported from Czechoslovakia and elsewhere in contravention of the truce, the Jews advanced rapidly and succeeded inisolating various Egyptian detachments from their bases.      Onthe 4th November the Security Council adopted, a resolution(text at Annex A), introduced by the Delegates of China andthe United Kingdom, which called upon the combatants to with-draw their forces and authorised Dr. Bunche, who had beenacting as Mediator since the assassination of Count Bernadotte,to establish lines beyond which no movement of troops should .take place.      By the same resolution the Council appointed aCommittee which was instructed,  in the event of either party or both failing to comply with the resolution,  &quot;to study as amatter of urgency and to report to the Council on further measures it would be appropriate to take under Chapter VIIof the Charter&quot;.22. The resolution of the 4th November was followed by another resolution which the Council adopted on the 16th(text at Annex A), calling upon the parties to enter intoarmistice negotiations.     After this resolution, adojjted on american initiative, the Jews demanded Egyptian agreement toarmistice talks as a condition for their own compliance withthe earlier resolution of the 4th November.      This to some extentconfused the issues.23. In accordance with the resolution of the 4th November,the Acting Mediator issued instructions to the combatants onthe 13th.      Under these instructions the Egyptian forces wereto be confined, to a small area.along the coast from theEgyptian frontier to a point north of Gaza, and the Jewishforces (apart from their settlement garrisons) were towithdraw behind the lines they had occupied on the 1lj-thOctober.

2h. These decisions were accepted by the egyptian government.      The Jewish authorities did not comply withthem, but retained their new positions and launched a secondoffensive against the Egyptians on the 22nd December.     Therehad also been a renewal of fighting in the north at the endof October,  as a result of which Jewish forces established themselves on Lebanese territory, from which they have notyet withdrawn.25. The Acting Mediator sent a report on the outbreakof fighting in December to the Security Council in which forthe first time he made a definite attribution of blame to one party alone - the Jews - and said that there had not been anyacts of provocation on the Egyptian side.      The Jews claimed that they had started fighting because the Egyptians refusedto negotiate for an armistice under the 16th Novemberresolution.      The Egyptians maintain, and their claim has never been denied, that they told the Mediator&apos;s representa-tive on 20th December that they v/ere ready to undertake these negotiations provided the Jews showed their readiness toaccept the hth November resolution.    (The text of the ActingMediator &apos;s report to the Security Council is attached at annex C. )     l&quot;would call particular attention to the factreported by Dr.  Bunche that the Jews entirely prevented theUnited. Nations staff from observing the operations in southernPalestine.      This was the culmination of the obstructiveattitude which the Jews had already for some months past been showing towards the United Nations personnel.26. Despite the clear refusal of the Jewishauthorities to comply with the resolution of the hthNovember, the Committee of the Security Council has notundertaken the task assigned to it, of considering whatsanctions could appropriately be applied to whicheverparty had failed to comply.      The principal reason for thisis the reluctance of the United States Government to be associated with any measures which would be unwelcome tothe Jewish authorities.      Thus on the 29th December, whenthe Security Council, having considered the second phase of the fighting in the Negeb, again demanded implementation of the hth November resolution, the United States Delegateabstained from voting (in company with the Delegates ofthe U. S. S. R.   and the Ukraine).      (The text of theresolution of the 29th December is at Annex A. )     earlier in December the United States Delegate on the security council had supported the application of the Jewish Statefor admission to the United Nations, notwithstanding thefact that the applicant was simultaneously refusing tocomply with the&quot; Council&apos; s requirements.      No doubt theAmerican attitude was due in part to the fear that unless they supported the Jews the latter would draw closer tothe U. S. S. R.

27.    This evidence of the aggressive spirit being shown by the Jews was discussed in the Cabinet on 12th November(C.M.(h8) 71st Conclusions) and it was agreed that steps should be taken to ensure that we could if necessary carryout our Treaty obligations to Transjordan if Transjordanwere attacked.     The Cabinet therefore agreed thatreinforcements and supplies could be sent to the R.A.P. atAmman and that naval dispositions should be taken to ensurethat Aqaba could be defended against It was agreedthat the Prime Minister should decide when this action should be taken in the light of further discussions whichwere to be held with the Americans.28.    Mr. Marshall was informed that we might have to take these steps and in reply said that it was clearly a matter for us to decide whether we had to reinforce our owninstallations.     At the same time he pointed out some ofthe objections where might be raised against the actionwhich we proposed.     No decision was taken at that time toput either of the above plans into effect immediately.29.    At the end of November Jewish forces which had beenpushing eastwards and southwards from Beersheba, set up a post between the Dead Sea and the Red Sea and sent patrolsinto Trans Jordan territory.     The attention of the security council was called to these infringements of Transjordanterritory and to the importance this might have for us in    .view of our Treaty obligations.30.   Meanwhile discussions were being carried on inJerusalem between Jewish and Transjordan Commanders witha view to establishing a cease-fire first in Jerusalem andthen along the whole Arab Legion front.     After this cease-fire&apos; had been established the Jewish representatives proceeded to expand the talks into general discussions for an armistice and for a political settlement.     The Transjordan government having regard to their obligations to other Arab countries,had to proceed prudently and when they showed some hesitation in expanding the scope of the talks at that stage, the mostthreatening attitude was adopted by the Jews who said thatTransjordan must now choose between peace and war.     TheTransjordan attitude was fully understood by the United StatesGovernment.31.   Having to some extent neutralised the Arab Legion frontby their threat to Aqaba and by the conversations in Jerusalem,the Jewish forces then turned once more against the Egyptiansand on 22nd December began a concerted attack on Egyptianpositions round Gaza and south of Beersheba and against theEgyptian garrison at Falluja which was still encircled contraryto the Acting Mediator&apos;s orders under the Uth NovemberResolution of the Security Council.32.    Later events-are still fresh in our memories.      On29th December we received reports that Jewish forces in thecourse of their operations had crossed into Egyptian territory.As the Egyptian reports were extremely unreliable and as theJews were preventing United Nation observers from going to thefront, and since we might have been called upon at any moment to go to the assistance of Egypt under the -Anglo-Egyptian treatyof 1936,  instructions were sent to the Royal Air Force tocarry out a reconnaissance, if possible in concert with the egyptians, to report the true facts of the situation.     Atthe same time an urgent message was sent to the United StatesGovernment informing them of the extremely critical situation

which was developing, which might have affected the stability ofthe whole Middle Eastern area, and of the prospect that we might at an early date be called upon to carry out our treaty obligations to Egypt.     The United States Under-Secretary ofState in replying to this message expressed the hope that we might be able to obtain reliable confirmation of the militarysituation as this would strengthen his hands in exertingAmerican influence on the Jews to withdraw from egytian territory.     This fitted in with the decision we had already taken to obtain information by Royal Air Force reconnaissance.33.       Very shortly afterwards the United States Government sent a very strong message to the Jewish Government to the effectthat the whole American attitude towards the Jewish state wouldbe changed if the Jews did not -withdraw from Egyptian territory.We understand that this message caused a considerable effect and that instructions were given to Jewish forces to leaveEgyptian territory.     These instructions were not effectivelycarried out, however, and a small Jewish force maintained astrong-point inside Egyptian territory.3h.       During the first week in January the Egyptians made aproposal for a cease-fire and negotiations with regard to the implementation of all three outstanding Security Councilresolutions (hth and T6th November and 29th December).     A very short time limit was given which expired before action could betaken.     The United States Government, however, then pressedboth sides to adopt a proposal on these lines and this was eventually agreed.     By the time the Committee of the security council met on 7th January the Acting Mediator was able to announce this agreement and the Committee decided that in thelight of this they need not for the present make any report tothe Security Council.     Conversations between Jewish and egyptian representatives are now taking place at Rhodes underDr. Bunche&apos;s chairmanship.35.       It was in the course of a reconnaissance on the same day.e. 7th January that the Royal Air Force aircraft were attackedwhile inside Egyptian territory by Jewish ground fire and aircraft.     We have absolutely reliable evidence that theaircraft were attacked inside Egyptian territory and had notbeen carrying out any offensive operations against the Jewishforces.     Their instructions were to avoid combat and only tofire if definitely attacked.     Preliminary reports from theUnited Nations observers who have been investigating the incidentshow that at least three of:the&apos; aircraft have been found wellinside Egyptian territory;    one has been found inside Palestine,having apparently crossed the frontier in the course of theair fighting which followed the second Jewish attack or perhap seven after control of the aircraft had been lost,36.       Meanwhile the Defence Committee had decided on 3rd Januarythat in view of the Jewish attack on Egyptian forces and the invasion of Egypt, we could no   longer delay putting ourselves in a position to meet our obligations to TransJordan and putting into effect the Cabinet decisions of 12th November.    instructions were therefore sent for supplies to be flown to Amman and, the trans Jordan Government having requested our assistance under thetreaty, a force was moved to Aqaba where it has now beenestablished without any further incident.

37.   His Majesty&apos;s Government have made it clear that they donot wish to prejudice in any way the chance of the Egyptian-Jewish discussions succeeding in producing an armistice basedon Security Council decisions and they have adopted an attitude of considerable restraint in dealing with the attackon Royal Air Force aircraft.    &apos; While we hope they will succeedand shall do everything in our power to contribute to theirsuccess there is still the danger that the Jews, with the egyptians neutralised, might take further military actionelsewhere, either in Jerusalem, against the Iraq forces in central Palestine, or against TransJordan.38.    In these circumstances it has seemed essential both toconsider whether we may have to take further measures to carryout our treaty obligations and at the same time to make a supreme effort to clarify American policy on the wholePalestine question in the hope that we may be able once more to pursue a concerted line with the United States Government..No further movements of British forces, have been undertakenand it is greatly to be hoped that none will become necessary.But it has become increasingly difficult to refuse any longer to honour our Treaty obligations to supply war material to our allies in the Middle East, in view of the fact that security council resolutions have been openly disobeyed by the Jews andthat other members of the United Nations have ignored&apos;their obligations and supplied arms.     There is no doubt that out failure to supply war material to our allies in the Middle .East has been the most damaging factor&apos; in our relations withthem and with the whole Moslem world.39.   As regards the Americans, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador atWashington has put to President Truman and the State department and frank picture of the difficult situation which has beenreached and of the danger both to the interests which we-andthe Americans have in common in the Middle East and to thevery conception of the United Nations itself by the hesitationsand unreliability of American policy.     He has expressed once more our earnest hope that the United States Government willlet us know clearly on what their policy is based and will join with us in (a) effective action in the United Nations tosecure compliance with the Security Council decisions;(b) the use of British and American influence in whatever waythis may be possible towards the achievement of a final settlement in which both parties can properly acquiesce.hO.    The United States reply given in the course ofSir 0. Prank&apos;s conversations with President Truman and theState Department has clarified the United States governments attitude to some extent but does not indicate that it will be easy for us to reach a new basis of close co-operation withthe United States over Palestine for the time being.

annex btext of mr. marshall1s statement issued to the press in paris as the unitednatjonsgeneral assembly session opened on21ST september, JL9g8-&quot;The United States considers that the conclusionscontained in the final report of Count Bernadotteoffer a generally fair basis for settlement of thePalestine question.   My Government is of the opinionthat the conclusions are sound and strongly urges theparties and the General Assembly to accept them in their entirety as the best possible basis for bringing peaceto a distracted land.&quot;No plan could be proposed which would be entirely satisfactory in all respects to every interested party.The United Nations had endeavoured to achieve a solutionby peaceful adjustment and entrusted the task to itsMediator, Count Bernadotte.   He energetically, courageouslyand with a spirit of complete fairness, we feel, canvassedall the possibilities and proposed as his last contri-bution toward a world of peace a sound basis for settlement.He gave his life to this effort.&quot;The complexities of the problem and the violentemotions which have been engendered are such that thedetails of any plan could be debated endlessly.   As amatter of fact, the debate on this question has beencarried on for years in almost every kind of publicforum.    It is our sincere hope that the parties concerned will realise that their best interests and the interestsof the world community will be served by accepting in .a spirit, of fair compromise the judgment of CountBernodotte.&quot;

TEXT OF THE ACTING MEDIATORS REPORT TO THEPRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL    DATED25TH DECEMBER, 1948In response to your request&quot;for all information available to me in connection with the note submitted to theSecurity Council by the Government of Egypt with referenceto the fighting in the Negev which began on 22nd November,I am communicating the following.On 22nd December I received a message from Haifasigned by the Chief of Staff of Truce Supervision, GeneralRiley, informing me that on the morning of 21st December anote had been received from the Israeli military authorities as follows:-&quot;In the light of the present situation in thecountry, the Chief of General Staff, Baruch, considers that themoment is opportune for reviewing the routines of truce super-vision with a view to their simplification and increasing the usefulness and efficiency of the liaison staff attached to theobservers in the service of the Chief of Staff.I am accordingly instructed to suggest to you toappoint an officer to discuss new methods and routines of supervision with myself and to inform you that in the meantime the Chief of General Staff, Baruch, has decided to suspendtemporarily all current arrangements for observers&apos; tours.The Chief of General St  iff, Baruch, would be grate-ful if you could inform this headquarters at your convenience of the name of the officer appointed, so that an initialmeeting can be arranged without delay. &quot;General Riley, in reply to this message, stated thatthe suspension of United Nations observer operations would be contrary to the provisions of paragraph (A) of the security council resolution of 10th October and that the suggestion was unacceptable.On 21st December the senior United Nations observerat Tel Aviv reported that he had been informed by Israeliauthorities that they would not provide liaison officers forroutine observation trips until the meeting they desired hadbeen held, and that liaison officers would be provided only for unusual incidents or complaints.      On 22nd DecemberGeneral Riley received a second message in the same vein butadding that the Israeli authorities &quot;did not intend to suspend observer operations indefinitely&quot;.On 21st December I sent the following message for communication to the appropriate officials in the Governmentof Israel.&quot;In my view the course proposed in Baruch&apos;s messagewill constitute a most serious obstruction to the truce, willbe in direct contravention of the truce resolutions of theSecurity Council, and if persisted in will make it imperativefor me to report to the Security Council our complete inability to supervise the truce on the Israeli side.      This wouldseverely affect prospects for armistice negotiations.      we will, of course, give serious consideration to any views orsuggestions which the Provisional Government may see fit to advance as regards the methods and procedures of truce super-vision. &quot;-1-

The daily truce supervision report of 20th Decemberstated that the -Israeli refusal to furnish liaison officersmade impossible truce observation in the Al Faluja area on that day.On the night of 21st December General Riley con-ferred with Mr.  Shiloah of the Government of Israel and pointed out that the situation at Al Faluja was the stumbling-block to the initiation of armistice negotiations in the Negevsector.      General Riley informed ivlr.  Shiloah that he was con-confident that armistice discussions could proceed promptly if the Israelies would consent to the withdrawal of the encircledEgyptian force at Al, Paluja.      Mr.  Shiloah promised a promptrepiy from his Government on the proposal for the evacuation of the Egyptian force by stages.On 22nd December the following reply was receivedfrom the Government of Israel, signed by Mr.  Eytan.&quot;Mr.  Reuven Shiloah has reported to the Government onthe conversation he had with you yesterday evening in Haifa,and I have now been instructed to transmit to you in the nameof the Government the reply which Mr.  Shiloah promised to letyou have by tonight.The Government of Israel has during the past two weeks been watching with concern the steady deterioration ofthe prospects for peace with Egypt.     Following the visit madeto the Middle East at the beginning of this month byDr.  Ralph Bunche, who felt that there was a good chance of theEgyptian Government agreeing to the initiation of armisticetalks in accordance with the Security Council&apos;s resolution,the Government of Israel was prepared, as a token of goodwill,to order that a start be made in the evacuation of theEgyptian forces encircled at Paluja.     A communication to this effect was made to Dr.  Bunche on December 9&apos;th. .The Government now understands that the egyptian government has changed its mind, and that it is not willingto take anjr practical steps in the direction of peace.     TheEgyptian Government appears to confine itself to a singleclause in a resolution passed by the Security Council inorder to undo the main purpose the Security Council had inmind - namely the conclusion of an armistice as a first step towards peace.      In. view of the fact that the Egyptian Govern-ment has done nothing to indicate any desire on its part to achieve a peaceful settlement, even after the Government of israel, in response to Dr.  Bunche&apos;s appeal, expressed itsreadiness to release by stages the Egyptians surrounded atFaluja, the Government of Israel feels bound to reserve its freedom of action, with a view to defending its territory andhastening the conclusion of peace. &quot;On 23rd December United Nations observers stationed at Gaza on the Egyptian side reported that the Gaza coast wasshelled by an Israeli ship on 22nd December and that the townitself was bombed by aircraft on 23rd December.      They alsocommunicated reports from the Egyptian G. 0. C.  that Israeliaircraft had attacked El Arish airfield, Khan Tunis and Rafah on22nd December, and that Al Faluja had been attacked by air-craft, artillery and mortar fire.

The Chief of Staff informed me on 23rd december that in view of the Israeli refusal to permit United Nationsobservers in the Negev it was not possible to maintainobservation of Israeli military operations.      The Chief ofStaff expressed the opinion that in view of these circum-stances there was a grave possibility of resumption of wide-spread fighting in the Negev.General Riley further informed me on 23rd december that Israeli mobile forces had not been returned to the Negevsettlements:    that their forces had not been withdrawn fromlocalities occupied since 14th October:    that Beersheba had notbeen evacuated:    that the establishment of United Nationsobserver posts in the Negev had not been permitted:    that food and medical convoys under United Nations supervision and escorthad not been permitted through Israeli lines to the encircledEgyptians at Al Faluja:    and that the Egyptians had not been permitted to withdraw from Al Paluja in compliance with the november 13th plan for the implementation of the 4th Novemberresolution of the Security Council.The daily truce supervision report of 23rd December,stated that there were no further reports of fighting in theNegev, but that the Israeli authorities would not provideliaison officers to the Tel Aviv observer teams on that day.    Ihave no knowledge of any incidents which could be claimed as aprovocation for the fighting in the Negev which began on 22ndDecember.The recent conferences which I had undertaken in cairo and Tel Aviv, followed by similar conferences held by&apos;General Riley in Cairo on 19th and 20th December, have con-vinced me that armistice negotiations covering the Negev sectorcould be initiated if some progress could be made toward asolution of the problem of the encircled Egyptian force atAl Ealuja.      In our conferences with Israeli officialsGeneral Riley, Vigier and I have constantly stressed that theAl Ealuja situation is exclusively a matter of truce super-vision;   that the truce cannot be exploited as a means oflaying siege;    that the plan of 13th November for the imple-mentation of the 4th November resolution of the security council required the withdrawal of the Egyptian force;    and thatthis withdrawal is prevented only by the refusal of the Israeliforces to permit it.In view of all the above circumstances I must reportto the Security Council my inability to supervise effectivelythe truce in the Negev, since United Nations observers arebeing refused access to the area on the Israeli side, and since, as indicated in Mr. Eytan&apos;s message of 22nd December&quot;The Government of Israeli feels bound to reserve its freedomof action&quot;.    I must also report my view that the intransigentattitude assumed by the Israeli authorities on the situation at Al Faluja is a major factor in preventing progress towardsimplementation of the resolution of the Security Council of1 6th November.
