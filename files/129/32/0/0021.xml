Statement on Defence 1949l-introduction &quot;1. The defence problem of to-day; has three main features. First, thereis the basic task of reconstruction, of building and equipping new and efficient units from the residue of bur wartim$ forces and of fitting them into the framework of a longrterm national defence jplan-a plan, which mustallow for the introduction of new weapons arid:be. appropriate to our obliga-tiOns to the commonwealth and Western- Union and to any future arrangements concluded for the defence of the North Atlantic area. Secondly,there is the task of maintaining our existing forces from day to day in acondition in which they could resist aggression if suddenly and unexpectedlycalled upon to do so. Thirdly, and concurrently with the above tasks,arrangements must be made to meet a whole range of current commitments the provision of Forces of Occupation in Germany; Austria and Trieste; the extra Forces necessary to reinforce the local security measures in such areas as Malaya, Hong Kong, West Africa and some of the ex-Italian Colonies;and finally the normal range of burdens&apos;which falls to the Armed forces as a matter of course in peace&apos; time.     j2. This Statement describes the&quot; main developments over the past year(Section II),. the progress of our arrangements for co-operation within theCommonwealth and with other countries (Section III), and our plans and intentions regarding the development of our national Forces over the coming year (Sections IV-IX).II.-DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PAST YEAR3. In the autumn of 1948 the reconstituted Home Fleet carried out a cruise to the West Indies. The appearance in those waters of H.M.S.Duke of York with cruisers and destroyers in company was an encouragingsign of the recovery of our naval strength. During this cruise the WhiteEnsign was seen in the United States of America, and aircraft carriers and destroyers visited South Africa. In other parts of the world the Royal Navyhas shouldered its customary responsibility for lending speedy aid in difficultsituations: the landing of Marines from H.M.S. Sheffield in British Hondurasin support of the local administration; the visit of H.M.S. Nigeria to the falkland Islands Dependencies ; the cover provided for the evacuation from palestine by units of the Mediterranean Fleet including the employment ofthe Royal Marine Commando Brigade in the final phase; the despatch ofsloops when disturbances were feared in West Africa; the support of our land forces in Malaya and Transjordan; these illustrate the calls made uponthe Royal Navy during the years all of which our seamen and Marines met with their customary efficiency! promptitude and skill. The study and practical exploration of new possibilities in the art of naval warfare hascontinued to receive close attention. The large-scale exercise of the home fleet in co-operation with the. Royal Air Force and the Army in december last was designed to try out Fleet dispositions against the threat of atomicbombing and. to test the organisation for defending pur shores against sea-borne attack.  Of no less significance are the cold-weather trials carried out
in northern waters by an aircraft carrier; destroyers, submarines and other vessels designed to test the latest equipment under the rigorous conditions ofthe Arctic. - -4. The Army has met the many calls placed upon it all over the world.  large garrison is required in Germany, and, in beleaguered Berlin, british soldiers with their French and American comrades afford to the people ofthat city visible evidence of our determination not to abandon them. Atthe same time our occupation commitments in Trieste and Austria continue.Meanwhile new situations in Malaya due to Communist-inspired terrorism,in Hong Kong as a result of the developments in the Chinese civil war, andin Transjordan owing to the invocation by that country of the Anglo-Transjordan Treaty have required the despatch of British troops to those areas. Our commitments have also continued in Greece and in the ex-Italian,colonies of Africa. The redistribution of the troops in the Middle Eastconsequent upon the withdrawal from Palestine a considerable operation in itself-has created difficult problems of reorganisation. Amid all these;preoccupations the work of rebuilding the new Army has proceeded. Inparticular, measures have been put in hand to ensure that the Territorial^Army organisation is developed to allow it&apos;to handle the National Servicereservists who will begin to enter it in the middle of 1950.5. The Royal Air Force, while engaged in the work of reconstruction,has had to meet the unexpected demands of the Berlin air lift.The achievements of the Royal Air Force Transport Command crewsin association with the United States Air Force and British civil aircraft, and aided by aircrews from Australia, New Zealand and SouthAfrica, in maintaining the life of the Western Sectors of Berlin since June and throughout the winter are a remarkable story of sustained and successfulendeavour. The strain has been great. Flying personnel and ground staffs inall categories and trades have combined to overcome difficulties and have succeeded in giving a demonstration of outstanding vigour, organisation and efficiency. Support for the evacuation of Palestine, three brief operations inthe hinterland of Aden, support for police and military forces in Eritrea and now in Malaya are further tasks which have fallen to the Royal Air Force.In the meantime training has not been neglected. All. the Home Commandsand British Air Forces of Occupation, including the Royal Auxiliary AirForce Squadrons, took part in operation &quot;Dagger&quot; designed to exercise theearly warning and fighter control systems. Exercises by Bomber Command?included the periodical detachment of squadrons to the Mediterranean.;\ Ofmany goodwill visits to other countries perhaps the most notable was ? the;first crossing of the Atlantic by jet aircraft when the Vampires of No.. 54Squadron visited the United States and Canada. ;16. Combined Operations activities have continued throughout the year.&quot;The Combined Operations Schools have concentrated on the training and operational sides of the work, and various demonstrations and visits have beenarranged. The outstanding demonstrations were thosegivenby the CommandoBrigade at Malta to an Allied audience, by the Amphibious School at portsmouth to the Staff Colleges, and one of close assault given by theCommandos near Falmouth. There have also been two inter-Service exercisesWith the Beach Brigade. The Home Combined Training Squadron, withspecialist detachments embarked, sailed from the United Kingdom and carriedout exercises with the troops stationed in the Middle East and with thegarrison at Gibraltar. Close liaison with the United States of America hasbeen maintained. There has been an interchange of visits by officers connectedwith Combined Operations in the two countries and a team from the combined operations School has visited the United States Marine Corps School atQuantico and the Canadian Staff College at Kingston, Ontario.

The Charter of the United Nations defines as one of its-main purposesthefaaictenance of international peace.and security. To this end it&apos;lays down a procedure far ensuring the pacific settlement of international disputes andmakes jJrovision for resort if need be to collective action with respect tothreats to the peace, breaches of the peace and acts of aggression. Thegeneral -concept includes the building up of United Nations Armed forces under the control of the Security Council to he used if need -be for. these purposes.9- His MajestyV-Government have from the outset done everything intheir power ,to -promote and-assist  his primary -aim -of the United nations and will continue to do so. The\degree of success achieved has, however,proved a grievous disappointment and the establishment of collective securityon a worfd-wide basis under the United Nations has not been achieved. Inthese circumstances, His Majesty&apos;s Government have necessarily devotedincreased attention to co-operation with other members of the Commonwealth,the United States of America and other like-minded powers and generally tothe development-of-appropriate regional security arrangements as contemplated in Article 51 -of -the United -Nations Charter.commonwealth the meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers, which was held inLondon in October 1948, provided the opportunity for a valuable reviewof -defence jjreblems facing the various countries of the Commonwealth.ftl. Ther&amp;was general approval df the existing arrangements for consulta-unnfogtweenC^monwealtfe countries on defence matters. recommendations for improving these arrangements have been submitted to the governments for consideration, and substantial progress has &quot;been made in estatrMshmga basis on which military co-opeFation could be developed. In consequence,His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom hope that it will now bepossible further to improve, withm the framework acceptable to each mdi-viduai Commonwealth Government, aDiangements for military ^cooperationand for consultation on military planning.12. Planning and eonsultatron have taken place between individualC^rnmonweaKh authorities in respect of various areas which are df concerntolham, and there have been frequent exchanges of visits by officers; dfficialsand scientists between the countries of the Commonwealth.13. Colonial Governments are already devoting an appreciable part oftheir resources to the maintenance of local defence Forces To preventthe dissipation of our armed strength and to free the United Kingdom forces for then- true role, local/Forces must be built up to the extent -necessary todeal -with the present disturbed conditions. His Majesty^s *fovemment, inconjunction with the Colonial Governments concerned, are thereforeexamining the size and composition of the local Forces required.
Western Union

14. In this sphere the most significant step has undoubtedly been the setting up of machinery to give effect to the defence obligations assumed by the Western Union Powers under the Treaty signed at Brussels in March 1948. The Fulfilment of these obligations gives rise to many novel problems, but substantial progress has been made in a period of less than 12 months. The whole-hearted co-operation which has been developed is a good augury for the future.

15. Under the general guidance of the Defence Ministers of the five Powers concerned, a Western Union Defence Organisation has been set up providing for the co-ordination of defence measures in the military and supply fields and for the study of the tactical problems of the defence of Western Europe. In addition the defence organisation provides the framework on which, in the event of an emergency, a command organisation could be built up.

16. The Committee of Defence Ministers is assisted, on the side of strategy and plans, by a Western Union Chiefs of Staff Committee, and as regards supply by a Western Union Military Supply Board.

17. The Western Union Chiefs of Staff Committee has taken as its permanent staff the Military Committee organisation which has been working in London since May 1948. Inter-Service subjects are dealt with by planning staffs which have functions similar to those of the joint staffs which serve the United Kingdom Chiefs of Staff. Subjects which affect a single Service are dealt with by the three Service Advisory Committees, which deal direct with the respective Service Departments in each country for executive action. Detailed, technical problems are dealt with by sub-committees whose members are drawn from the Service Departments of the five countries.

18. A Western Europe Commanders-in-Chief Committee has been established under the chairmanship of Field-Marshal Viscount Montgomery of Alamein. The position of Commander-in-Chief Land Forces Western-Europe is held by Général d&apos;Armée de Lattre de Tassigny: that of Commander-in-Chief Air Forces Western Europe is held by Air Chief Marshal sir James Robb: and Vice-Amiral Jaujard has been appointed Naval Representative with the title of Flag Officer Western Europe. The main task of this body is to study the tactical problems of the defence of Western Europe. It will not assume executive command of any forces in peace time.

19. The Western Union Military Supply Board works in close co-operation with the Western Union Chiefs of Staff Committee the Chiefs of Staff dealing with the shape and size of the forces to be maintained and formulating requirements for weapons and equipment, and the Supply Board with ways and means, including plans for the development of a balanced war potential at the disposal of the Western Union countries. The Board has a permanent staff which comprises representatives of each country and is directed by a Supply Executive Committee. This latter body and its sub-committees work in close co-operation with the Military Committee and its sub-committees.

20. A broad review of the present defence production capacity of each of the five countries has been made and plans have been developed for equipping the air defence forces of Western Union. Meteors and Vampires are being supplied to France, Belgium and Holland, and arrangements are well advanced for the manufacture of these aircraft in these countries under licence. British ground radar equipment is also being supplied from the United Kingdom for an integrated early warning-system.


21. United States and Canadian observers attend meetings of the western union Chiefs of&quot; Staff Committee, the Military ^Supply .Board -and the subordinate committees which work for these two bodies. *h22. A Finance and Economic Committee has been created to work-inclose co-operation with the Western Union Chiefs of Staff Committee and theWestern Union Military Supply Board on problems affecting the inter-change of supplies and services between the defence forces of the five powers.Defence of the North Atlantic Area- 23. The signature of the Brussels Treaty and the developments whichhave followed are important achievements which illustrate the growingcohesion of the peace-loving countries of Western Europe. But the defenceof Western Europe can only be treated realistically if considered in. duerelationship to the wider problems of the defence of the North Atlantic area.For this reason His Majesty&apos;s Government are participating in discussions which are now taking place in Washington with the object of developing the conception of regional defence and reaching a collective arrangement withinthe framework of the Charter of the United Nations for the North; atlantic area.IV.-FINANCE .&apos;24. The cost of building up the Forces needed to implement our defence policy and to shoulder the tasks described earlier in this Statement is inevitably heavy. Its very magnitude reflects our determination to play apart appropriate to our national strength and responsibilities. An important part of the heavy cost is due to the responsibility for administering occupied territories which devolved on us at the end of the war and to the extra forces which we have had to send abroad to reinforce local security measures. these developments have resulted not only in a high proportion of the armed forces being located overseas but also in their being to an important extentdispersed in comparatively small groups over very wide areas. These factors and the added overheads associated with them have contributed heavily tothe overall size of the Defence Budget.25. The net financial provision for defence purposes proposed for 1949-50is as follows: --  millionAdmiralty       ...      ...      ........... ...      189-25War Office      ...      .............      ...      304 70Air Ministry   ........,      ...      ...      ...     207 45Ministry of Supply    ............     ....      57-75Ministry of Defence   ...      ...      ...      ...... -71Total......      ...      ...      ...      ...     759 86;An analysis of the Defence Budget arranged in a form closely related tothe common Votes of the Army and Air Estimates is given in Annex n..26 Excluding war terminal charges the Ministry of Supply defence expenditure in 1948-49 amounted to about  49-25 million. There is nolonger any need to provide for terminal charges this year, and the increaseof  8-5 million is chiefly on account of defence research and development and to a less degree on departmental expenses on new procurement.27. The Defence Budget has now been relieved of the cost of severalimmediate post-war activities. There is no longer any provision for expenditureon the administration and control of prisoners of war and certain responsibilities in respect of the occupied territories in Africa are being transferred to a CivilDepartment.
28. ,In the total Defence Budget of  759:9 million wax terminal chargesaccount for  13-26 million compared with  60-5 miUiondn 1948-49.  This-figure does not include the cost of release leave pay rand allowances of menpballed up after 1st January, 1947, which are regarded as normal, charges.The main items are.  1 - 37 : million for the Polish Resettlement Gojfps, 1 03 million for release benefits of men called up before 1st January, 1947, 9 16 million for Works and Land charges, and  1 million for terminationof contracts.      .;    . .29. Excluding war terminal and non-effective charges and the cost ofthose non-military activities of -which the Service Votes have now been relieved, meremaining provision in the three Service Estimates for 1948-^49;stood at about  545-5, milhori. The comparable figure this -year is 654 - 5 million.&quot; Of the increase of   109 miliibn,. approximately one^third is accounted for by increased Service rates of pay, by increased civilian wages; bythe increased cost of insurance charges for Servicemen and civilians, and byhigher prices for supplies. Increased expenditure on the Reserve and Auxiliary&quot;Forces accounts ior more than  5 million, and the balance is accounted; for under the heading of equipment. This extra provision.for equipment is largelyattributable to the emergency measures authorised inSeptember .1948; but the trend in this direction will become more pronounced as time goes on.. Thereare three reasons for.this.: First, we can no .longer rely;; to.the same -extent^pnsurplus waf &quot;stocks, which are in any event getting&quot; steadily older and moreunbalanced. In many cases the stocks held against future Service requirements have now been used up and new production has become necessary, not only tomeet current maintenance needs, but also to-build up reserves to the minimumlevel.necessary-toguard against a sudden emergency. Even where substantialsupplies remain over from the war as, for example, of vehicles, considerable expenditure on overhaul and repair is required to restore, them to a serviceablecondition! The vast quantities of equipment handed in oh demobilisatiofi weremostly in need of overhaul. They could not be serviced at the time without serious dislocation of the demobfiisation scheme;, nor could they, be housedat peace-time standards without making unacceptable calls on civilian storage accomodation. The work of overhaul, which has gone On continuously,must now be accelerated to cope with the increasing demands for current use.Secondly,; we-must-proceed .with&apos;providing the-Forces with some of the:improved arms and equipment demanded by the conditions of modern.war-fare. Finally, -the cost of equipment has. increased greatly. Apart from theincrease in the actual production costs of standard articles, which has been considerable even in the last two or.three years, the increasing number and complexity of equipments now in use have magnified the expense of fittingout a unit or formation with ne\v equipment. ;30. Of the increase of about  81,000 in the Ministry of Defence Estimates, 25,000 consists of expenditure previously borne on other Votes and  52,000relates to-secretarial and common service arrangements for Western Unionestabhshments located in London. Other expenditure arising from UnitedKingdom activities in Western Union, for example, on account of, the british service personnel who are full-time members of the various staffs and corri-&apos;miftees; is included in the separate Service Estimates.&apos;     i&apos;   &apos;       V. MAN-POWER.   ,&apos; - --&apos;.: 31. Since the end of hostilities the Armed Forces have had to face three con-current man-power tasks: first, to disperse the,huge war-time forces; secondly,to build up the peacetime regular strength; and, thirdly, to maintamadequatenumbers to meet current commitments. With the release of the last of theage-and-service groups the first task may;.be considered complete. The second
is a slower process since there was a cessation of regular recruiting during hostilities, and the attraction of returning to their homes with a certainty of employment resulted, understandably, in a comparatively small proportion of men with war service remaining as regulars. The third has necessitated, and still necessitates, the training and employment of large numbers of National Service men.

32. Between June 1945 and April 1949, when the age-and-service release scheme is due to end, the strength, of the Forces will have fallen from well over five millions to roughly 793,000. During this period some 51/2 million men and women will have been released from the Forces. The intake of recruits and National Service men will have amounted to more than a million. Hundreds of thousands will have joined and passed through the Services since demobilisation started.

33. The inevitable effect is that the Service all suffer from lack of men with long experience or a high degree of Service skill, although in the event of an emergency large reserves are at present available from among the trained men and women who served in the recent war. The dominant needs to-day are to conserve the present reduced body of skill and experience, and to build up by regular recruitment and training and by re-engagement. With the greater stability of numbers which is now approaching, special efforts will be directed to this end.

Strength of the Forces in 1949-50

34. As a result of the decision to suspend releases from the Forces for three months and to increase the period of full time National Service from 12 to 18 months, the reductions in the Forces during 1948-49 contemplated in the Statement Relating to Defence 1948* will not be achieved. Instead of a total strength of 716,000 on 1st April, 1949, as given in Annex I to that White Paper, it is estimated that the figure on 1st April, 1949, will be 793,000. The total fall in strength during the financial year 1948-49 will be about 138,000. Releases during that year will number about 375,000.

35. The intention is that by the end of the financial year 1949-50 ? strength of the Forces will be about 750,000. The following table shows the numbers that are expected to be borne in the three Services at the beginning and end of the financial year:-

1st April, 1949 31st March, 1950

Navy 145,000 146,000

Army 416,000 391,000

Air Force 232,000 213,000

793,000 750,000

National Service

36. In accordance with the provision of the National Service Acts National Service men called up in 1949 will be liable for part-time service from mid-1950 onwards. By that time it will be necessary to have reduced the length of service of National Service men called up in 1947 and 1948 from the current period of not more than 27 months to 18 months. A revised table giving the maximum period to be served by all those called up in 1947 and 1948 has been published.

*Cmd 7327


37. The man-power plan for 1949-50 provides for the call up of 174,000 National Service men divided as follows:-

Navy 10,000

Army 120,000

Air Force 44,000

These numbers are rather more-than the numbers accepted last year. The age of call-up throughout the financial year will remain at 18 years 3 months and will not be increased to 18 years 6 months by the process of dropping one of the four annual registrations as was suggested in the Statement Relating to Defence, 1948. The longest possible notice will be given of the registration programme and the programme for the whole of 1949 has already been announced. The numbers becoming available for call-up in 1950 and later will be appreciably increased by men whose periods of defenment expire, and it is probable that it will gain become necessary to raise the age of call-up in order to restrict the intake to the numbers required by the Forces.

38. It is the aim of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the highest possible proportion of its peace-time defence commitments (i.e., those which require the employment of Forces on whole-time service) should be met by regular Forces. In pursuance of this aim it is their intention to do everything in their power to stimulate recruitment for the regular Forces and the re-entry of time expired men. It is their earnest hope that as time proceeds a combination of improved recruitment and re-engagement with diminished defence commitments will enable their aim to be realised. For the present, however, a large gap exists which can only be filled by the National Service man. The need for National Service as a means of training reserves remains as described in the Statement Relating to Defence, 1948 (para. 61).

Recruitment for the Regular Forces

39. The post war level of regular recruitment compares favourably with the pre-war figures. In 1948 19,000 regular other ranks were accepted for the Navy, 34,200 for the Army, and 13,600 for the Air Force. But in view of his Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s desire that the highest possible proportion of the day-to-day commitments should be met with regular Forces, a greatly increased flow is necessary.

40. Much thought has, therefore, been given to methods of stimulating regular recruitment and re-engagement. Service in the Armed Forces is a direct and important contribution to the security of our country and His Majesty&apos;s Government believe that on these grounds alone it will always possess a strong attraction for many. They intend that this attraction should be reinforced by conditions of service which are such as to make a wide appeal and to compete on reasonably equal terms with employment in civil life.

Pay and Conditions of Service

41. In pursuance of this policy His Majesty&apos;s Government have considered the question of pay in the Forces. From 24th November, 1948, increases in pay were granted to regular other ranks and increases in marriage allowances to regular officers and other ranks.*

42. In fixing these new rates weight continued to be given to the disadvantageous features of life in the Forces, such as frequent changes of station, and separation from families. There are on the other hand, many favourable features which must not be forgotten. Service pensions and gratuities.

*Cmd 7588


which are: non-contributory, the generous allowance of paid leave in theForces, the opportunities for promotion and the fact that, in addition to hispay, the Serviceman is fed, clothed and accommodated by the Services (orvreceives cash allowances in lieu), must all be taken into account.   -   t )43. One of the handicaps to an improvement in recruiting is uncertainty about resettlement in civil life after discharge. Close contact has been-maintained between the Service Departments and. the Ministry of, labour in regard to this important problem and during the past year plans havebeen made which should go far, certainly further than at any time in thepast, to alleviate it. For example, a comprehensive scheme for providingopenings for ex-regulars is being worked out with industry, with thesupport of the Minister of Lahour&apos;s. National Joint Advisory Council. Theheed for special training for civil employment either within industry or inestablishments set up: by the Ministry of Labour will be considered as part ofthat scheme. In Government service a proportion of vacancies for - the clerical and executive classes will, in future, be reserved for competitionamong ex-regulars. The Trade Unions have already agreed that men trained in a wide range of Service trades should be recognised as qualified for mem-membership as skilled men, and discussions are proceeding with a view to recog-nisihg the status of other Service tradesmen. There will also be schemes oftraining to assist selected candidates who wish to enter business. These com-prehensive arrangements will, it is hoped, greatly enhance the attractivenessof the Services to the right type of regular recruit. . &quot;&quot;Use of Man-power in the Services44. Quite apart from their conditions of service members of the Forcesrightly want to be satisfied that they are doing a worth-while job and arenot wasting their time. In the upheaval and dislocation arising from the turn-over of man-power referred to in para. 32, there was almost inevitably somewaste of man-power, and this has given rise to some legitimate criticisms.A concentrated effort is being made to secure a progressive improvementin this regard, since His Majesty&apos;s Government believe that the proper and economical use of man-power-the military equivalent of higher productivity-4s a matter of crucial importance. The Service Ministers will accordinglycontinue to give the subject their unremitting attention, until a satisfactoryposition is reached.     -; r /    - c !;Reserve and Auxiliary Forces. :- ;,45. Apart from their regular reservists each Of the Services could, as stated in para., 33, at present rely on large reserves consisting of trained men and women who served in the recent war. The value of these reserveswill, however, gradually decline. National Service will in time: providereserves in considerable numbers, but these in no way supersede the needfor voluntary Reserve and Auxiliary Forces. The training obligations imposed on National Service reservists are not of themselves sufficient to produce,;for example; a fully operational member of aircrew, a highly skilled tradesmanqr an experienced non-commissioned:, officer. For such purposes additionaltraining is needed which can only be given on a voluntary basis in-theReserve and Auxiliary Forces. The success of the current campaign to buildup, these Forces is therefore of the utmost importance. The series of broad-casts by the Prime Minister and other Cabinet Ministers arid.by opposition leaders should leave no doubt on UVs score: they have made, it clear thatrecruitment to the Reserve and Auxiliary Forces, as&apos; weQsas^,:fo;,tne^Reg^larForces, is a vital national need. The gratitude of &quot;the nation&quot;isi due &quot;to many thousands of men and women who have joined the voluntary Reserve and
Auxiliary Forces over the past months; Nevertheless, as the following figures show, many more are needed to complete the ranks of these voluntary&quot;nrces:- ! -&apos;-.-.-,-,&apos;...Strength	Strength	1st October	1st January	target2,747	-   3,241	7,000	199	70055,306	67,210	150,0002,494	3,509*	29,0002,806	4,459*	38,000Royal Naval Volunteer ReserveRoyal   Marine   Forces   volunteer reserve   ...      ...Territorial Army and Women&apos;s royal army Corps (Territorial Army)Royal Auxiliary Air Force......Royal Ah Force Volunteer ReserveWomen&apos;s Services\ 46. His Majesty&apos;s Government have also given their attention to providingopenings for women in the Forces. The Auxiliary Territorial Service andWomen&apos;s Auxiliary Air Force, which were founded on an auxiliary basis in1938 and 1939 respectively, have been reconstituted as a permanent part of theregular Army and Air Force with similar career prospects and a similardisciplinary code. The new Forces, the Wpmens Royal Army Corps and theWomen&apos;s Royal Air Force, came into existence on 1st February, 1949, underthe Army and Air Force (Women&apos;s Services) Act passed in April 1948.Similarly, the two Nursing Services will become permanent parts of the Armyand the Royal Air Force. The Women&apos;s Royal Naval Service has also become a permanent and. integral part of the naval service under its own code of discipline. New and generally much improved rates of pay for the W.R.N.S.,the W.R.A.C. and the W.R.A.F. were also introduced in November 1948,together with a scheme of retired pay, Service pensions and long-servicegratuities.!Civilian Man-power47. A conspectus of the civilian man-power employed by the service departments, the Ministry of Supply and the Ministry of Defence is included inthe table at Annex I. The expected reduction during the year 1948-49 in thenumber of civilians directly employed did riot occur owing mainly to theemergency measures put in hand in the autumn of 1948. No significant changein numbers is expected to take place in 1949-50. The expanded production programme will need additional man-power. Further, the essential tasks of moving, preserving, sorting and disposing of stores will continue to call for theemployment of many civilians.VI.&apos; EQUIPMENTProduction Programme 1949-5048. The 1949-50 production programme represents the minimum neces-sary to cover the maintenance requirements of the year after the fullest use ofremaining war stocks; to provide for the build up or overhaul of some.of themore essential emergency reserves in continuation of the steps authorised inSeptember 1948 ; and to allow for a modest instalment of modernisation.49. The Naval programme provides mainly for the maintenance require-ments of the Active Fleet and for some progress in refitting ships of theReserve Fleet; Only a token provision is made, for new construction-apartfrom the continuation: of programmes outstanding from former years.* At 15tfi January. &apos; &apos;       t Cmd. 7607.       -
Additional aircraft, wjil;be;provided and the development, of new type^willhe continued.50. The bulk of the funds available to the Army will be used to -rneepordinary maintenance requirements and reserve deficiencies, and for ths.overhaul or modernisation of existing equipment. Nearly  14  million willbe spent on the vehicle overhaul programme alone. Among the-moreimportant items included in the Army re-eqmpment)rjr^raBJmeare tanks,Tadar, and radio: in the field of air defence provision is.made.for themoderni-sationof certain types of specialist equipment-and-&apos; the-reptewisbBient of reserves.51. The Royal Air Force programme continues, at an increasing rate, there-equipment of the fighter squadrons with the latest type of jet aircraft and provides for the gradual replacement of transport and training aircraft by modern British types. In addition, the reconditioning of: war-time stocksof ^fighter aircraft, undertaken as one of the precautionary measures, willcontinue. Re-equipment will extend to certain major items.inrthe field oftele-communications and radar. A considerablevehicle rep^is prograrnji^will continue.52; Besides meeting the requirements of the Services, industry mtheUnhsdKingdom supplies warlike equipment and stores to other parts of the GomrriQn-wieauh and to friendly foreign countries.War Potential53. To safeguard our industrial war potential we have retained as muchas.possible of the specialised capacity and equipment called into being, duringthe war. The Admiralty has a strong nucleus in the Royal Dockyards,&quot; and theprivate shipyards and the marine engineering industry can also be readilyadapted for the production of warships. In the aircraft industry the specialisednucleus of firms which design airframes and aero-engines and would lead andtrain newcomers if we had to mobilise industry for war has been maintained.The Ministry of Supply have stored considerable quantities-of plant-for-makinglight alloy forgings and extrusions, the lack of which retarded the expansion ofthe aircraft programme in the years -before the war.54. In the munitions field, the.Ministry of Supply have%een able to^keepin, production a considerable number of RoyaKGrdanee Factories, wife-?heaid Of.  measure of civil;work undertaken without detriaientte-waB-poteSSal.They have also stored large, quantities of specialised -pfaat,: machine; *teote,jigs;;;^ia^,;&apos;artd:akp&apos;.iarnm^6oii components, explosives, and propeSantswhich- would meet the needs -of the filling factories in the eaasly period df a trot.55. Plans for the transition from peace to war production are being prepared and a start has beep, made,on the. compilation of a register ofindustrial capacity earmarked fW-speoMc purposes!Disposal of Stores ;    ), 5J5, It.wprdd have been unjustifiable, even if it had been physicallypossible,, fof theSeryices to keep the colossal quantities of equipmentwfaii&amp; they held, in all parts of the world at the end ef the; war! Thiseq^uhJment was &quot;often stored in conditions which- were -satisfactory -whenthe turnover was rapid but useless if the goods had to be housed ^for several years,- &apos; 3Sie borage and maintenance problems were increased as equipmentWas iansdted an on demobilisation and the depot;staSs. became smaller andsmaller, Much of the-storage in Ibis country-and in some Commands overseaswas.in requisitioned buildings urgently-meeded for. crvil.purpose.es. The,-needfor wholesale and rapid disposal was fully appreciated by the Coalition
Government; &quot;who laid-aoVes1 in -1944* ft&apos;fx)Mcy &quot;subsequently endorsed by the,present Government. It was to dispose only of items surplus to the-paPtr^aiteqxapmsni. --and&apos; reserve requirements of the Services. No exceptions to- thisjme (have been made except where disposal was. the only. alternative toAbandonment or rapid deterioration, or where particular items were urgentlywanted for civilian use, or for the expert drive. Some goods, have-been sold,,;others bavebeen disposed of to Commonwealth Governments, pr friendlyforeign &quot;Powers.. Large stocks, were left behind in India, and Burma by arrangement with the-Governments of those countries; Stocks have alsobeen drawn upon continuously, and extensively to meet the current main-teiiahce needs of the-Forces in the period since the war, and to help Greecein her struggle against aggression.VK.-RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT57. !His Majesty&apos;s Government regard progress in research and develop-raerit a&amp;-a matter of supreme importance. Supervision and eo-ordinatioh. ofthe programmes is the responsibility of the Defence Research Policy -Cdih-mittee which, under the chairmanship of Sir Henry Tizard, advises theMinister pf Defence and the Chiefs of Staff on matters connected - withthe formulation of scientific policy in the defence field, and is respohsibrefoe ! presenting to -the Minister of Defence an annud unified review of future defence research and development policy. The^Controller ofthe Navy-and the two Controllers of Supplies in the Ministry of Supply(responsible for munitions and aircraft production) are now members bothof the Defence Research Policy Committee and of the Joint War production staff, which ensures a close co-operation between these two&quot; bodies. Theposition of Sir Henry Tizard, who is also Chairman of the Advisory Councilon Scientific Policy, ensures a personal link with research on the civiFside.The Defence Research Policy Committee is served by a permanent staff;: 58. Little can be said about progress&apos; in research and development as for the most part it must remain secret Among the &quot;projects whichmay be mentioned are improvements in radar for the location of targets andfor fire control;-improvements in anti-aircraft fire control; and development in equipment for the detection, location and destruction of submarines;;Notable advances -have been made in turbo-jet and turbo-propeller aero-engines and in the design of aircraft, and we. have extended our knowledgeabout Sight through the trans-sonic zone and into supersonic speeds.- A bigincrease has been achieved in the rate of fire of certain guns and improve-ments have been made in bridging equipment representing ah importantadvance on the Bailey Bridge. Research and development directed to theproduction of unconventional weapons is-proceeding on high priority, and suchweapons will be brought into use as and when they are ready. Meanwhile,the Services must be ready, if need be, to fight with the weapons of ta^diy.VIII..-THE WORKS PROGRAMME   ,60.  The works programme is of necessity influenced by the capital invest-ment programme in the United Kingdom and balance of payment cqn-siderations abroad.   In consequence, excrading war terminal charges, the effective net provision for works and lands varies little from that in 1948^49.61. Withdrawal of stores from palestine .and other theatres made itnecessary to spend large sums in 1948-49 on the building of new storage accomodation.    A substantial reduction in the provision of this item in-   - * Gma. 16539&apos;.       -     -
1949-50 makes, it possible to increase the allocations for other worksprogrammes. . -62.  In view of the importance attached by His Majesty&apos;s Government;to the improvement of living conditions of the Forces there will be an increase,.,in the provision for married quarters and the present substantial outlay onf.)improving barracks will be maintained, while further increases in the provis-ion for improving the standard of housing will continue to be made as rapidly as circumstances permit.   In 1948 the Services completed 1,258 married quarters at home and 652 abroad.  They plan to complete 2,726 and 1,935respectively in 1949.   Quarters have also been provided in 1948 by con-version of existing buildings and hutments and this will be continued in 1949.63. The purchase of land and the construction of many drill halls,quarters for permanent staff and other works are essential if the TerritorialArmy is to be ready to receive the flow of National Service men leaving the. Forces from 1st July, 1950, onwards. His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to ensure the timely completion of this programme on which a start hasalready been made. The provision for Territorial Army works and lands has accordingly been doubled.IX.-COMMON ADMINISTRATIVE POLICY IN THE SERVICES64. After the recent war, and largely because of the developments duringthe war years, the complete amalgamation of certain of the major commonadministrative services of the Forces was advocated in many quarters. HisMajesty&apos;s Government, while not excluding the possibility of eventual amalga-mation &apos;of certain services, concluded that immediate amalgamation was undesirable.65. The Defence White Paper for 1948 stated (paragraph 47). that co-ordination Committees had been established for the medical, educational,and chaplaincy services. The Medical Committee, on which the Ministryof Health is represented, was first in the field and proposals covering many important aspects of medical administration have already been consideredby the Committee or Service Ministers, to whom these Co-ordination Com-mittees report. Among the recommendations of this Committee to which effect has been given are a number dealing with the working relationship between the medical services of the Forces and the National Health Service,designed to avoid overlapping of functions between those services. In the major Commands overseas, similar Committees have been set up by theService Departments to secure the greatest measure of local co-ordinatioriof the medical services, not only of the Forces themselves but also withany Government medical service in the territory concerned. Useful work has also been done by the Educational and Chaplaincy Committees. TheChaplaincy Committee is concerned mainly with the administrative aspect ofthe work of the Service chaplains. There is already a large measure 6f;co-operation on a denominational basis between the chaplains of the three services at home and overseas and this process is being fostered in everyway in order to achieve economy of man-power.66. Apart from this specific machinery for inter-Service co-ordination inthe administrative field, the Ministry of Defence, as one of the main respohsi-bilities with which it was charged, provides a focal point for inter-Serviceconsultation and for resolving those matters in which common administrativepractice is desirable. -&quot;The work of the Ministry in this field is constantlyincreasing. Implementation in each of the Armed Forces of policy decided upon by the Cabinet, or the Minister of Defence and the Service ministers in consultation, remains the responsibility of the Service Ministers,
