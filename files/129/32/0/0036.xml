THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1949SECRETG.P. (49) 26CABINETTHE ADMISSION OF NEW POLITICAL PARTIES IN AUSTRIA: Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs   ; :I wish to obtain my colleagues&apos; consent to a modification of our attitudetowards the recognition of new political parties in Austria.2. The present position is governed by two decisions of the Allied Councildating from the early days of the Occupation. The first, taken in September,1945, accorded the right of existence and activity to the three Parties whichhad appeared immediately after the War : the (Agrarian) people&apos;s Party, theSocialist Party and the Communist Party. This decision established the principlethat unanimous recognition by the Allied Council was required before a political party could operate in Austria. The second decision, in February, 1946, rejected the application of certain small groups to be recognised as Parties, on the groundthat they did not enjoy sufficient popular support. This principle was subse-quently followed by the Allied Council in the case of other applications.3. When, last summer, a group calling itself the Austrian DemocraticGroup applied to the Allied Council, the Soviet representative pressed for itsrecognition. Nothing in the programme or personalities of this group appearedto Warrant the Soviet departure from the line hitherto followed in regard to theseapplications. It is probable, therefore, that having failed to undermine the solidarity of the two Parties the Socialist and the People&apos;s Party whichcomposed the Coalition Government, the Russians had decided to follow the tactics, which they had pursued with success elsewhere, of encouraging the growth of splinter parties which might draw away votes from the anti-Communist parties and generally confuse the political situation. For this reason, as well as onaccount of the unsatisfactory character of the Democratic Union, the three western powers in Vienna have so far refused this recognition.4. The Austrian elections are due to be held next October, and the campaignis already under way. At the last elections, in which the Communists suffered-a crushing defeat, the People&apos;s Party obtained a slight majority over the Socialists.The latter are naturally anxious to redress the balance. They do not, however,,expect any significant increase in their own votes and consider that their best hope would he in the division of the forces of the Right. They accordinglyfavour the recognition of the Democratic Union. The People&apos;s Party claim,on the other hand, that the Democratic Union would be a rallying point forex-Nazi elements, Nationalists, and those in favour of Pan-Germanism and theAnschluss.5. I do not want to interfere in the internal affairs of Austria or to takesides in the elections. We have consistently supported the Coalition Governmentin its courageous resistance to Soviet pressure. I believe that the present two-party structure in Austria is the natural expression of the country&apos;s feelings.While any splinter parties that may be formed are likely to weaken the presentcoalition to some extent, I do not believe that there is any serious risk at present of these splinter parties developing and of breaking up the coalition. Indeed, boththe Socialists and the People&apos;s Party are fully agreed that the coalition must bemaintained. I am therefore not concerned with the effect that the creation of new36604Copy. No. 3
parties in Austria might have on the existing parties, or on the number of voteswhich the latter win, in the forthcoming elections.. But.,I believe that, the stateof war with Austria having come to&apos;ah end in September 1947, it is wrong for us to continue to interfere in the free evolution of Austrian political life andto deprive the Austrians of the freedom to create new parties in accordance withthejr constitution if and when they wish to do so. : rj /  y6! I therefore propose that, subject to the concurrence of our French &quot;and american colleagues, the British representative on the Control C6uncil;i!$houlddeclare that, in our view, the time has come when the Occupying Powers ^should cease to make their approval a condition for the creation ahB^eratibh of hewpolitical parties in Austria and that he should ask the Allied Council to agreethat this question should henceforth be treated as one of purely Austrian concern.If this proposal were accepted, the question of the recognition of new parties would no longer come before the Allied Council, and that body would not berequired to pronounce on the recognition of the Democratic Union and other parties. If the proposal were rejected by the Russians we should at least haveshown that we had done what we could to give Austria her freedom&quot; infthis respect.7. I feel that the above solution is in accordance both with our generalpolicy towards Austria and also with sentiment in this country, and: I invite mycolleagues to approve it. ..    ; .    - .. , ... ;    JIf;) - JD.   &apos;&apos; u&apos;Foreign Office, S.W. 1, &apos; ;21st February, 1949. v :t
