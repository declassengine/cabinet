ft   fl  f iMYS^jl C R E TO.P. (49) 39 COPY NOiiTH MARCH,  1949CABINETTHE SITUATION IN china memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs     &quot; &apos;I circulate herewith, with reference to C. P. (48) 299of 9th December, 1948, a further review of developments inChina and South East Asia.     An attempt has also been made to assess the economic position of the Government of a Communist-dominated China. y2. As foreshadowed in my previous papejr, I have con-suited the Chiefs of Staff on the military implications of thesituation and the possibility of co-ordinating military measures within the region to meet any possible strategicthreat.      They have reached the following general conclusions:-The spread of Communism into Southern China will cause increased unrest and consequently an increased securitycommitment throughout South East Asia.      It will also increasethe threat to our sea communications in war, which would be particularly serious if Formosa were to come under Sovietdomination, and increase the difficulties of delivering the air offensive from the Japanese islands.      In consequence, theforces required in the area in both peace and war would beincreased.      Should the Russians establish bases in SouthernChina, the threat to South East Asia and to our sea communica-tions might become serious.      If Communism successfully spreadsinto the Indian sub-continent, our whole position in South east asia would become untenable.      They go on to suggest that untilall countries interested in the area have agreed on a policy forthe Far East, the only military consultative and informationorganisation which is, likely to be effective is the exchange of intelligence information on Communist activities and theexchange of police information.3. In the light of these conclusions and of the politicaldevelopments outlined in paragraphs t to 15 of the attached memorandum, I now recommend -(a) that v/e should pursue our study with those friendlypowers to whom we have already communicated thesubstance of our initial study (C.P.(48) 299);(b) that we should examine further with these same powers possible economic measures in defence ofour interests on the basis of paragraphs 16 et secg(c) that the necessary authority be given to establishliaison between police and intelligence organisa-tions in the area as a whole.      I regard this as one of the most useful practical steps to takeimmediately.Eo B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1.4TH MARCH, 1949.IhIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY !S GOVERNMENT)

THE SITUATION IN CHINA/t nx    The situation in China was last reviewed, in cp.(ko) 2yy of 9th December.   Since then the Communists have moved down to the North hank of the Yangtse and their holdon North China is now complete.   Though President chiang kai-shek -shek has retired from the scene to leave the way clear fora, settlement by negotiation, there is recent evidence that heis still exerting influence through the Kuomintang &quot;Old Guard&quot;.A delegation has been sent to Peking on behalf of theNationalist Government to make preliminary enquiries as toCommunist peace terms and the Acting President Li Tsung-jenis. reported to be reasonably optimistic that peace negotiationswill eventually ensue, but Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s continued inter-ference-makes it doubtful whether a settlement&apos;acceptable to both parties will result.   Meanwhile, fighting is at a.stand-still and the Communists, who clearly feel that time is ontheir side, ajjpear in no hurry to make any further move.   Theyore reported to be building up their strength on the North bankof the river.   They have a well-equipped force of some twomillion men to their credit while it is doubtful, if the nationalists can now muster more&apos; than a million poor troops.2.     Politically, the Nationalist hand has been furtherweakened by the rival policies within the Government.   most recent reports, however, indicate that the Acting President,who on the transfer of the seat of government to Canton hadbeen virtually alone in Nanking, is regaining control of hisscattered ministers.   All but the Prime Minister have beenbrought back to Nanking for a conference.   If it is true thathis initial peace mission&apos; has now returned from the Northhaving been received by Mao Tse-tung, the Acting President&apos;sprestige should be greatly restored.    The economic situationis deteriorating steadily.    The gold Yuan established in August at 12 to the pound was quoted in mid-February atover 5,000.    These developments all go to reinforce the tentative view expressed in the previous paper that Communistdomination of china must be regarded as inevitable.3.     The present Communist administration in North china is provisional, and. at the moment even do facto recognitionwould be premature-   In any case His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill have to consult Commonwealth and other friendly Govern-ments before considering recognition.   So far it has proved impossible for officials to establish any form of contact with the Communist authorities.   There are British and other foreign consulates in the communist-held towns of Mukden,Peking and Tientsin, but the Communist policy is apparently .to cut official consular communications with the outside world and to refuse to recognise the status of consuls until the -Governments concerned recognise the communist regime.h.     The British communities in Mukden, Peking and Tientsinretain their liberty of movement within these cities and seemto be unmolested, but the important British commercialcommunity at Tientsin is gravely disturbed by businessconditions since the city fell.   Trade is at a standstill,the city is still under a purely military administration,the Communists seem to have no plans for foreign trade,and some firms are short of money, since a new currency hasbeen introduced by the Communists who ore unwilling to accept anyother, even U.S. dollars, in exchange.   H.M. Ambassador considers,however,  that a revival of Tientsin&apos;s trade is likely tofollow quickly on a political settlement, and many difficulties may be due to Communist suspicions and.

administrative inexperience,      It would be unwise to form any conclusions at this stage.5.       The consultations with friendly Powers as to thebest means of containing the Communist threat to all. our interests authorised by the Cabinet on 13th December, 1948,have not as yet proved very productive.     With the exception ofIndia, Commonwealth countries have offered no comments of sub-stance.      India takes the view that a Communist-controlled-regime in China would be absorbed by internal problems, whichthey would handle according to Chinese methods and withoutaccepting Russian dictation, that their foreign policy would bein line with Russia&apos;s, that Communists in South East Asia wouldbe encouraged by events in China, but would receive ho directhelp from there, and that the correct course for other countries would be to help national movements in South East Asia and main-tain contacts with the new Government in China without anycommitments.     The United States Government are actively studying the paper but have not as yet vouchsafed any authoritative views.The French Government have expressed general agreement with ouranalysis and offered to co-operate generally in the intelligencefield, while the initial reaction of the Siamese has been to enquire tentatively what help may be expected from His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the United States Government to meet the even-tualities which we have postulated.     We have delayed any approachas yet to the Netherlands and Burma in view of their more immediate pre-occupations.6.     The present situation in South East Asia is reviewedbriefly in the following paragraphs.      A separate paper reviewing the situation as regards defence in Hong Kong and Malaya isbeing submitted by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.BURMA7.       The position of the Burmese Government in the communalconflict has deteriorated in the last few days.     The Karens nowappear to have gained control of most of North Burma, while tothe South the hold of the Burmese Government on any area, exceptRangoon and its immediate vicinity &quot;is at best tenuous.      TheGovernment have promised autonomy within the Burmese Union.tothe Karens, but this gesture may have been made too late and theKarens may be prepared to continue the fight, fortified by theirvictories in the North.      On the other hand there are indications that they are anxious to negotiate a settlement with the BurmeseGovernment.8.       There have been a number of reports from Burmese sources of Karen co-operation with the Oommunists,      These reports, none of which were reliable or first-hand, may well have been a Burmeseexaggeration of the fact that the Karens may have employed dacoitswho had been previously employed by the Communists.     The Karensare strongly pro-British and they and the Communists are ideo-logically at opposite ends of the political spectrum.9.       The question of financial and other assistance to Burmais being discussed by Commonwealth representatives, with theagreement of the Burmese Government, in New Delhi,INDIA AND PAKISTAN10.        India and Pakistan are well aware of the present chaosin Burma and of the threat to themselves of continued instabilitythere.      In both countries the public is following the Governmentin a growing appreciation of the internal dangers of Communism but,in India at least, the dangers to South East Asia as a whole,arising out of the Communist victories in China, are not yet fully appreciated.      In India some 500 Communists have been arrested on the ground that they were planning active

sabotage of industrial production and railways.    Thecease fire which came into effect in Kashmir where thegrowth of Communist influence gives some cause for concernon 1st January has been well observed and has induced aroticeable improvement in relations between the two Powers.The appointment of a Plebiscite Administrator acceptable to both sides is awaited.    He will probably be an American.INDONESIA11.    The Netherlands Government announced their plan on February 26th for the transfer of power to Indonesia.Briefly the intention is to convene a round table conferenceat The Hague on the 12th March, to be attended by RepublicasB,non-Republican Indonesians, and the United nations commission for Indonesia.    This conference will work outplans foV the formation of an interim government and thetransfer of power much earlier than envisaged in the security council resolution.    To this extent their plans are inadvance of the Security Council resolution, but there is a major obstacle to its acceptance as a satisfactory basis for settlement in accordance with the Security council resolution in that there is no intention of allowingRepublican leaders to go back to Jogjakarta.    Unless theDutch can agree to the Republicans returning to Jogjakartatheir plan may miscarry.    Meanwhile, the guerilla activitiesof the Republicans continue, and it is improbable that theDutch can ever inspire a purely military solution.      An earlypolitical solution is thus a necessity.INDO -CHINA12.    Slow progress has been made in the negotiations between ex-Emperor Bao Dai and the French Government on indepen-dence for Annam.    The main bone of contention is the status &quot;ofCOchin-China (one of the 3 envisaged provinces of the future VietNam) which still remains a French colony as distinct from an&quot;associated State&quot; of the French Union.    Ft is understoodthat agreement has been reached on defence, diplomatiorepresentation and economic matters.      Bao Dai is not likelyto return to Indo-China to head the proposed new CentralGovernment until he has obtained satisfaction, on thestatus of Cochin-China.    This depends on a vote of theFrench Assembly, who do not yet seem to realise the implications of developments in China and the consequenturgency of reaching a settlement.SI AM13.    The National Declaration of Emergency Decreewhich Marshal Pibul wished to enforce as soon as possiblein order to provide the Siamese Government with powers todeal with the Communist external and internal threat, waspromulgated on 23rd February.    Critics of Pibul1s Declarationof Emergency see in it an. attempt by the Marshal to furtherhis own ends.    Fighting has broken out in Bangkok betweenunits of the Siamese Army and Navy but the Governmentappears to be in control of the situation and any politicalopposition appears to have been overcome.    The situationis however still rather obscure.1h.    On the Siam/Malaya border co-operation between.&apos;

Siamese and Malayan security forces is reported to beimproving, but the Siamese forces are handicapped in operations against the bandits by their indifferentequipment.    The United Kingdom are providing some military equipment for the Siamese as a matter of urgency:arrangements have also been made for certain training facilities to be given to the Siamese, and for the exchangeof intelligence on bandit activities.CHINESE COMMUNISTS15.    A police raid on the house of a leadingChinese Communist in Hong Kong has produced a diary anda series cf notes which make it clear that the chinese communist Party is -,&quot;just as orthodox in its ideology andjust as highly organised as any of its European counter-parts.    A summary of these documents, is attached.

This hasnot been done&apos;hitherto since it was felt that the islandswere a predominantly American sphere of influence.ECONOMIC CONSIDERATICNS   .16.    The following is an assessment of the major economic problems of a Communist-dominated China, and of possible ways of exploiting to our advantage any economicweaknesses that may emerge.    The economic long-term policyof the Communists will be on normal Communist lines andwill be directed towards land reform, state industrialisationand the expropriation or expulsion of foreign interests,but  it is assumed that in the initial period economic difficulties will be so great that the Communists willperforce move slowly towards these goals, and accordinglythat they may be disposed to tolerate foreign interestsfor a time.17.    Communist economic weaknesses can be summarisedunder the following heads:(i)   Finance.The Communists will have great difficulty inbalancing the budget, increasing taxation, diminishingexpenditure and maintaining confidence in their currency.They will face the same threat of runaway inflation asthe present government but may be expected to take more drastic steps to deal with it.(ii)   Food and Agriculture.Before the war China normally imported about one million tons of rice a year.

The following is an assessment of the major economic problems of a Communist-dominated China, and of possible ways of exploiting to our advantage any economicweaknesses that may emerge.    The economic long-term policyof the Communists will be on normal Communist lines andwill be directed towards land reform, state industrialisationand the expropriation or expulsion of foreign interests,but it is assumed that in the initial period economic difficulties will be so great that the Communists willperforce move slowly towards these goals,  and accordinglythat they may be disposed to tolerate foreign interestsfor a time.17.    Communist economic weaknesses can be summarisedunder the following heads:    . -(i)   Finance.The Communists will have great difficulty inbalancing the budget, increasing taxation, diminishingexpenditure and maintaining confidence in their currency.They will face the same threat of runaway inflation asthe present government but may be expected to take more drastic steps to deal with it.(ii)   Food and Agriculture.Before the war China normally imported about one million tons of rice a year.    This figure will bedecreased if the Communists control Formosa, but ricesupplies will be insufficient.    Internal distribution is another problem (see under Transport below).    Foreign&apos;agricultural machinery, of which the Soviet Union and the

satellites cannot supply much, will probably be desiredbut not immediately essential, nor, owing to the natureof rice agriculture  in China, necessarily indispensable.(iii)   Industry.Industrialization will require foreign capital,foreign capital goods and foreign technical, assistance.It is doubtful whether the Soviet Union and the satellitescan provide much of this.(iv)   Transport.Adequate distribution of food supplies andeconomic prosperity depend on the improvement of internalcommunications and the, maintenance of shipping facilities.The Communists will depend on foreign vessels for their overseas trade in any case, and for coastal trade -ifthe present Chinese mercantile marine is denied them.Sufficient river transport will, however, be available.But vast quantities of supplies will be necessary to restore the war damaged railway system, and transport maywell prove tc be one of the Communists&apos; most seriousweaknesses.(v)   Minerals and Raw Materials.China will-be almost entirely dependent on -non-Communist sources for supplies of rubber, oil, and fertilisers.    She will be deficient in raw cotton.    Themost serious mineral deficiencies will be the ferro-alloymetals.(vi)   Trade.Foreign trade has in the past been relativelyunimportant in China&apos;s economic life, and the Communistswill no doubt continue the present Chinese policy of restricting imports to capital goools and basic essentials(oil, rubber, food, etc. )   They may very probably wish toincrease exports in order to be able to import more.18.    Although United Kingdom trade with China has.lately been very small, British merchant and industrial interests are established in China in such strength thatthey conduct a very large proportion Of China&apos;s trade withthe rest of the world and operate a large number of industrialenterprises in China.    Apart from the invisible earnings from these activities the total value of British commercialproperty and investments in China was assessed in 19h1 at 300,000,000.    This figure excludes subsequent war damage,but the present total value is still very considerable.If British and other non-Chinese interests were to cuttheir losses promptly and remove whatever property theycould it would undoubtedly greatly increase the Communists&apos;difficulties, but from the point of view of the interests concerned the financial loss,  as most of the propertycould not be got out, would be not much less than if the communists took over all these interests in the first place without compensation.    In any case it has been decided on

political grounds that British interests should Toesupported in their desire to keep their foot in the doorin China as long as possible, and on economic grounds itwould be regrettable to cut ourselves off from- a potentially vast market for British goods and. a potentiallyimportant soft-currency source of supply of essential-imports (including eggs, tea, broad beans, bristles, soyabeans and flour, and tung oil).    With the great internalneed in China and our own need for soft currency supplies,potential trade if conditions were at all normal mightbe at least double pre-war.&apos;19.    The best hope for British interests to maintain -themselves for some time longer in China seems to lie in -the presumed Communist need for the continued functioning of British public utilities,  insurance, banking, commercial&apos;and shipping agencies and industrial enterprises untilthe Communists are ready to take them over or have organizedalternatives.    Whatever economic weapons may be at our disposal for the purpose of protecting British economic interests in China it is considered that they should beheld in reserve for as long as the Communists are preparedto tolerate the functioning of British concerns.    Theprobable result of any attempt to bring economic, pressure&apos;to bear during the first phase would be to expedite the&apos;&apos;coming of the second phase in which the Communists are likelyto attempt some.form of expropriation.20.    On the assumption that the existence of foreigneconomic interests will only be tolerated for as long as their continued functioning is considered by the Communiststo be in their own interests, and that a stage will come when some form of expropriation will.be attempted,  it isclearly of the first importance that we and the other powers concerned shall endeavour to agree on a common.line in the face of this threat.    Our objectives in anyconsultations which may take place should bet(a) to persuade other Powers, and particularly the americans, who have smaller commercial interests inChina than the U.K., and who may be tempted to cuttheir losses at an early stage and to proceed atonce to a policy of economic warfare against the communists, to take no action for as long as foreign interests remain reasonably unmolested;(b) to reach agreement&apos;in principle with the other powers concerned- on the joint application of possible future measures of economic pressure against the communists should these later prove necessary andexpedient, on the understanding that they are in anycase to be held in reserve until such time as the communists begin to take definitely aggressive actionagainst foreign economic interests.     Action on theselines would not of course preclude the denial to China,by agreement with other Powers, of goods of strategic importance, where such denial would be effective.Bx hypothesi it is clear that any threats -by British -concerns to shut down their operations (even if&apos; concertedthrough, the British Chambers of&quot; Commerce) would have little effect on the Communists.      Any action would, therefore,have to be taken from outside China;   and the summary of communist economic weaknesses in paragraph 17 above does

not reveal any particularly strong card in our hand atthe present time.    The following possibilities present,themselves:(i)   The licensing of exports from the U.K.  to ChinaIt is considered that such a system should he introduced only as a last resort, and in any case should apply only to certain materials which we know the communists have particular need of.    It would in any case&quot;be no use to introduce a licensing system except on thebasis of agreement between the U.K.&apos;and other importantpotential suppliers,  and.it would obviously also benecessary to license exports to a number of Far Eastern   -ports outside China.(ii ) Oil SanctionsIt is possible that the denial to the chinese communists of oil supplies alone might prove to be a weaponof considerable value.    Such a sanction could be appliedeffectively by agreement between the United Kingdom, theUnited States and the Netherlands.(iii) The withdrawal of British shippingThis might, prove an effective sanction but wouldbe extremely difficult to operate since the licensingprocedure for British vessels is totally unsuitable forsuch a purpose.21.    While Communist action against British interestsin China may perhaps be delayed by suitable tactics, in thelong run   H.M.G.. are likely to be faced with a similarstate of affairs as regards expropriated British interests to that in Eastern Europe today, only on a larger scale.By this time we may be better placed in regard to the supplyof goods which the Communists most desire, and may thereforebe able to minimise our losses, perhaps through a trade and compensation agreement, or if necessary, &quot;by threats toimpose sanctions on the line of paragraph 20(b) above, or possibly by a combination of the two.

APPENDIXCHINESE COMMUNISTS.1.     The Security authorities in Hong Kong have recentlyobtained possession of certain documents obviously belonging &apos;to one or more influential members of the Chinese CommunistParty.   These documents paint a revealing picture of theruthless fervour, efficiency and cynicism of the chinese communists and provide abundant evidence that, far from theChinese Communist Party being moderated by any special&quot;Chinese&quot; factors, it is strictly orthodox, confident, mature,and at the highest level very well organized.   There is notrace of Titoism.   There are references to a high rankingmember of the Chinese Communist Party referred to only as &quot;F&quot;,   &apos;who appears to enjoy considerable authority and to expound thepurest Party line, correcting any deviations.   A statement bythis authority is, therefore, of considerable importance as showing that the Chinese Communist Party is.,fundamentallyorthodox and is not prepared to accept other parties, howeverdemocratic, unless they too are Communists.   The statementreads:&quot;The Chinese Communist Party will persist in pursuing the Democratic Revolution to the end,and will consolidate the Proletariat leadershipin the Revolution.   Under the correct and matureleadership of chairman Mao, the Chinese CommunistParty has become a powerful, unified and genuineProletariat political Party.   The ChineseRevolution has but one course, there being no alternative one ... Secondly, the &quot;CommonPolitical Programme&quot; passed by ^he coalition government&apos;/Note, the Chinese Communists intend to set up a &quot;Coalition&quot; government in the nearfuture/ has to be followed by every and eachpolitical party and clique&quot;...2.     The documents contain numerous references toCommunist intentions to use certain politics and parties fortheir own purposes for so long only as it suits then;;    alsoto employ intelligent elements as a bridge with the masses,following the step by step process until the complete-dictatorship of the proletariat is achieved..  Emphasis is laid on the necessity to build generally on the masses.Agrarian reform is discussed as a means to consolidate thesupport of the peasants, who are &quot;the Reserve of the CommunistArmy&quot; and on whom reliance must be placed.   But the need toproceed cautiously is stressed, particularly in regard to the selection.of new Party members.   The whole process of screeningcandidates for admission and testing their doctrinal purity is described.   Considerable space is devoted to the organisationof the Communist Party on orthodox lines.. Under &quot;the problemof Cells&quot;, quality and not quantity is preached.   There aredetailed instructions on how to set about the organisation ofWorkers in a new field:&quot;Study and understand the conditions.   In thefirst place make friends with them;    reformationto follow later.   Mix with them but do not becontaminated by them.   Do not relax, but make nohaste&quot;.   It is suggested that the first Coxmiunistpropagandist in an untouched village might goin the guise of a hawker, a small shop-keeper   .or a schoolmaster.

Detailed instructions are also recorded on &quot;how to consolidate&quot; which means the strengthening of theorganisation through a better understanding of the Party-line;    on self-criticism and other features of Communist-conscience-searching and on the &quot;Purge Problem&quot;.   In regardto the last it is interesting to note that a typical purgeis cited of 30^0 of the Party members in Central Hopei Province.3.     Touching on the history of the Chinese Communist.Party in South China, the documents reveal that the SouthernCommittee of the Party dates from 1936*   South China iscredited with having some loyal and trusted old Party members,but is considered to be weakened at present by the infil-tr at ion of opportunist elements and by too much concentration on the intelligentsia.   The mistake of ignoring peasants and &apos;workers is claimed to have been made.    In 192+1 the Party wasadjusted and in 1942 a further change appears to have takenplace which placed the South under the leadership of one referredto as &quot;Mo&quot;.   A lengthy analysis is made of the strong and weakpoints of south China from a Communist point of view and a plan of campaign mapped out on orthodox lines.   The documentsassert that the two southern provinces of Kwangtung andKwangsi are the focal point for Communism in South China.There is mention of the possible return to South Chinaof a Communist guerrilla unit transferred to north China in1946, but it seems to have been decided not to rely on thereturn of this force but to take &quot;bold action&quot; and &quot;do our best on our own initiative&quot;.4.

used, but if they are given any place in a so-called .Coalition Government they will have to enter on the CommunistParty1s terms and they will be allowed no policy of their own.There is clearly no intention to allow an opposition Partyoutside the Government.    Indeed, the Communist Party showconcern lest too many &quot;Rightists&quot;&apos; and &quot;Opportunists&quot; join the other Democratic Parties so as to be on the winning side and to;share in the &quot;spoils&quot;.5.     There is a lot of material on future Communistpolicy and the treatment of foreign interests.   Pains will betaken to show that the Communist Party rely in no way onforeignerse-   They will regard foreign industrial concerns -the zimerican-owned power and telephone utilities in Shanghaiare specifically cited - as having established themselvesthrough their special privileged position in the past.   Theseconcerns will be allowed to continue to function just so.long as it is expedient, and it will be made clear that theydo so only on orders from the &quot;Peopled Government&quot; and thatthey will be &quot;dealt with separately later on&quot;.   It is statedthat foreign shipping should be handled on the lines followed in Worth Korea.   Foreign shipping companies will not be allowedto continue as if nothing has happened.   They will have toapply individually for entry permits and it will be impressed upon them that they have no special privileges.6.     The documents record in the purest Communistphraseology important discussions on the method of taking over. Shanghai.   References are made to a &quot;vacuum period&quot;with the possibility during that period of the &quot;existence ofa chaotic state&quot;, and the desire of the &quot;Democratic Rightists&quot;to prevent this by &quot;preserving the status quo pending handing over to us&quot;.    &quot;F&quot; appears to have rejected these suggestions and decided that there shall be no &quot;vacuum period&quot;.    It seems clear that the Communists do not wish to take over Shanghaias a gift from other &quot;Democratic Parties&quot; and that they wouldeven prefer to delay action until they can assume control ofthe city on their own terms.7.     There are many references to Kuomintang officials who are either putting out feelers with a view to enlisting inthe Communist ranks, or who are actively working for the communists while inside the Kuomintang Government.   these included a number of personalities connected with the Kwangsiclique, members of the Kuomintang Branches, the NankingCommissioner of Police, recorded in the documents as havinggone to Hainan, and a number of Government Secret Service andMilitary Officials.&quot;8.     On the whole evidence suggests that Hong Kong ismore a regional than a purely,local centre and this lendssuoport to the &quot;view that Hong Kong may be the centre of a&quot;South China Bureau&quot; and a centre for transmittingdirectives to neighbouring countries e.g. the Philippinesand French Indo china. .
