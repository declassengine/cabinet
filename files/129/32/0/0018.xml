(u10)  18 COPY NO.       )28TH JANUARY, .1 9*4-9CABINETCOUNCIL OF europe memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign affairs my colleagues will see that the annexed&quot;directives&quot; to the Permanent Commission, which have beenagreed provisionally, and pending a reference to theCabinet in my case, preserve the right of Governments to choose their own procedure for selecting representatives on the so-called &quot;&quot;Consultative Body&quot;..     We shall thus be free to appoint our delegation in whatever manner wethink best, and to put whom we like on it.The plan also places very strict control overthe agenda of the Consultative Body.      It goes further in this respect even than the British plan, in that nsubject, however originating, can be placed on the agOnda^-i-wg,, ucui uc ijxacea on tne ageiof the Consultative Body unless it has the approval oftwo-thirds of the members of the Ministerial Committee.In return for this increased control, I haveagreed to omit any reference to bloc voting.      Mycolleagues will see from section (3) of the paragraphabout the Consultative Body that there is provision for voting to be by a majority of those present.     This means that each individual will record his vote- separately, butit by no means prevents vis, if we wish, from arranging for our delegates to vote together on matters where wethink this desirable.E.
