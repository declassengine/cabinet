... 35^THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC M\JESTY*S GOVERNMENT)confidential cp. (49) 40 COPY NO.25TH FEBRUARY.  1949.cabinet economic SURVEY FOR 1949Memorandum by the Minister of Labour -and National service understand that following the discussion which tookplace at the Production Committee about the size of the coal-mining labour force at end-1949 it is now proposed to alterTable XX in the draft Economic Survey by omitting the.word&quot;forecast&quot; at the head of the final column and by increasingthe figure for coalmining in the table for end-1949 from788,000 to 795,000*     At the same time it is proposed to make certain consequential amendments to paragraph 93 in order to. show that the figure of 795,000 in the table represents therequirements of the coalmining industry at the end of theyear.2. I am circulating this memorandum in advance of our discussion at the Cabinet on Monday so that my colleagues should have adequate time to consider the full implications of these proposals.3. The figure of 788,000, which at present appears inTable XX, is the total manpower figure corresponding to726,000 workers on the colliery books.     This estimate of theprobable strength of the labour force of the. industry at theend of 1949 was arrived at by a Committee representative ofthe Ministry,of Fuel and Power, the National Coal Board and myDepartment after they had carefully examined all the relevant factors likely to affect recruitment to and wastage from theindustry during 1949.     This estimate allowed for an intensivepublicity campaign to.stimulate recruitment and for wastageat rather&apos;less than the rate during 1948.     The reliability of this forecast of the probable strength of the .industry bythe end of the year has not been challenged.     No otherestimate has been put forward.4. The Official Committee&apos;s estimate that recruitmentin 1949 would not more than balance wastage, but would just       ,about do so, included an estimate of 30,000 adults, without previous mining experience, to be recruited and trained.      it also assumed that recruitment of European Volunteer workers would be resumed early in the year and produce 2,000.      Theestimate was based on the assumption that all availablerecruits could be absorbed in the industry.     An intimationhas, however, just been received from the National Coal board that in Scotland, Northern Division, North Western division and South Eastern-Division, no further recruits from AdultResidential Training Centres can be accepted, and that in theSouth Western Division Irish recruits could not be absorbedwithout restricting the placing of available European VolunteerWorkers.      It is plant that,  in these circumstances, so farfrom recruiting 7,000 more than the estimate we are likely to fall substantially below it.

Go lit X.stry of Labour and National. Service, S.W. 1.25TH FEBRUARY,  1949.5. If we now put in the table the higher figure of795,000, whether we describe it in the text as a target or asa requirement, we shall once again lay ourselves open toprecisely the same criticism as we had to face at the end oflast year as a result of having set&apos;manpower targets fortextiles and coalmining which were beyond our reach.      If weomit, as we should.have to do, the description of our figures as a forecast we shall leave the public in doubt as to whatthey represent.6.  ^ I appreciate the difficulty felt by the Ministerof Fuel and,Power and by the Chancellor in agreeing to putinto this table a figure which is lower than what is des-cribed in paragraph 93 as the requirements of the industry.Nevertheless, I feel bound to point out once again the serious difficulty we may land ourselves in by putting into the tablea figure which is some 7,000 higher than the most carefulestimates justify as a realistic expectation of the coal-mining manpower which could be achieved by the end of 1949 if all available recruits could be absorbed.      If this higher figure is to be included in the table, I think we shouldfrankly recognise that we do not in fact expect to achieve itand we must be prepared to face the criticisms we shallinevitably get once again for failing to achieve what we setout to do in the Economic Survey.     Failure to reach thefigure put into this table will net only lead to criticismsat home, but will be liable to create the unfortunate andmistaken impression abroad (and particularly in the UnitedStates) that the working people of this country are unwilling to take up employment in those essential industries on whichthe economic recovery of the nation depends and that we arenot, therefore, exerting ourselves sufficiently.
