There could also be difficulties in managing the.up year*Reserve, since the possibilities of overspend may not emerge until very late iniild22.    The MOD  are concerned that an administrative scheme of this kind w    any yearguarantee that flexibility would be allowed, since it would open to Ministers  nl    they t  decide to refuse to agree to the necessary supplementaries (if, for example, /view that the Contingency Reserve could not accommodate them).

A third possibility would be to enable the payment of bills to be delayed or to meet developing overspends or underspends.    The superficial attraction of *  ^ payments in this way is that the cash limits of each respective financial year would unaltered; a potential underspend, for example, would be avoided by accelerating rather than adding to the following year&apos;s cash limit.

saving of about El50 million and in future years the cost would average about  450 nl,lll0&quot;be 1982-83 prices with the cost being higher in some years, lower in others. The effec1 Contingency Reserve would depend on when the debits take place. If the carry-forwrard authorised in summer Supplementary Estimates, the cost to the Contingency Reser the scheme is in operation would be  600 million in 1982-83 prices, which would be oi ^ an underspend of  150 million.   However, if the debits only take place when e need the money then the cost to the Contingency Reserve would be smaller, in the r  450 million to  600 million, say  500 million, with the underspend being corresp  d,n smaller.?jse &apos;n5.     Since this costing was made in 1980, departments have gained greater expe&apos; living within cash limits.  So the estimated costs given above may be on the high slde&apos;&apos; cost might be a third less than the estimates given above ie about  300 milli n in ^ prices, so the effect on the Contingency Reserve would be between  300 mil-,on  450 million, depending on when the debits for carry-forward are made.

In unusually favo^8 ^ conditions contractors can improve on expected progress and become entitled to ^ progress payments than forecast. In poor conditions work can be delayed, even brought to halt, and the projected scale of payments then becomes an overestimate.7. Another uncertainty arises from the timing of claims arising from ^^jy contract or unforeseeable difficulties of terrain.

The two elements are not independent, however: if a department plans to the underspend it has brought forward from the previous year, it will probably notan *eliminate all its normal shortfall, as the augmented provision will act as constraint in the same way as cash limits in the current system.An optional feature of the scheme might be that any second year carry6..forward ***j ent.Inthenot be automatic, but would be reserved for Ministrial discussion and agreem example, in 1983-84, there would be no automatic carry-forward of  20m to eiie*e* actual spending matches basic provision.
