SECRET OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTc(82) 38 COPY NO29 October 1982CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY 1982 Memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury1. On 15 July, Cabinet agreed (CC(82) J^^^^^planning our aim in this year&apos;s Survey should be to hod   o the pi^ning totals which we announced earlier this year, that   s, for I9 d   and 1984-85, the aggregate of programmes plusJ^^g^decisions in the 1982 White Paper (Cmnd 8494) as modi*iedtoy the decisionsannounced in the Budget and with some min^t^s^^^efwith a I was invited to hold bilateral meetings with colleagues wixn a view to securing this objective.proposals2. These meetings have made good progress and I am most grateful to colleagues for their constructive help.3-     I now put forrcardfor the Cabinet&apos;s &apos;PP&apos;0!^*^&quot;^^ expenditure programmes set out in Annex A to this paper. They achieve the objective which we set ourselves in July and, &quot; and accepted, will lead to totals of  120.5 bullion  8|j84  127.3 billion for 1984-85 and  133.3 &quot;J?!^&apos;Qfconcerned.4.On some features of the proposals I should comment furthersa-    Defence.    Provision has been agreed for real growth in accordance with the Government&apos;s commitment to plan to implement in full the NATO aim of 3 per cent growth Per annum.    In addition, the defence budget has been increased to meet in full the defence costs associated with the Falkland Islands.   The latter account for the whole increase in provision of  622 million in 1983-84 and the bulk of the increases of  774 million and  648 million in the later years.1SECRET
SECRETb. Local Authority Current Expenditure.    The figures in Annex A reflect the agreements in E Committee and elsewhere, both on the provision to be made for this expenditure and, for 1983-84, on its distribution between services.    For Great Britain in 1983-84, a total addition of  1.07 billion has been allowed of which  270 million has been allocated to services.The remaining  800 million is included as an unallocated margin in recognition that local authorities will in reality overspend the service totals which we consider desirable.    The margin indicates the extent of the overspend we should reluctantly be prepared to countenance before applying grant penalties.c. Nationalised Industries.    The nationalised industry figures (set out in detail in Annex B) have been agreed with sponsor Ministers.    In summary, the totals are approximately at the baseline in 1983-84,  250 million above in 1984-85, and  370 million below in 1985-86.I consider this represents a satisfactory outcome to this year&apos;s Investment and Financing Review.d. Economic Assumptions and Pay.    Where necessary, the programme totals have been adjusted to reflect the most recent economic forecast.    The overall effect is an increase in expenditure on social security as a result of higher unemployment, partly offset by reductionson export credits and housing as a result of lower interest rates.    A general adjustment has been made reflecting our decision to adopt a pay assumption of 3.5 per cent for increases in public service pay compared with the original cash provision of 6 per cent.e     Special Sales of Assets.    The size and shape of our future privatisation programme are being reviewed at present and the figures in Annex A are provisional. Major elements in the current figures are Britoil (part proceeds expected in 1983-84), British Gas Corporation&apos;s offshore oil interests (1983-84), and British Telecom (part proceeds expected in 1984-85). My colleagues will note that the proposed planning total for 1984-85 is some  400 million below the baseline total.    This results from the much higher level of receipts which is now expected in that year.Contingency Reserve.    The proposals envisage that we should retain for unforeseen operational requirements in 1983-84 a contingency reserve of  1.5 billion. The precise figure I shall keep under review until the White Paper is published.    There is no operational need to take firm decisions now on the reserves for the two later years.    I have included a provisional reserve of  4 billion for each year, but I propose to review these figures when we come to prepare the Public Expenditure White Paper.2SECRET
SECRETMANPOWER5.     The proposals lor Civil Service manpower, which have in most cases been agreed bilaterally, are at Annex C.    They are within the limits which we agreed on 15 July (CC(82) 38tu Conclusions). At 1 April 1984, total Civil Service numbers should be just below our target of 630,000.    The figures for later years show a continuing decline but may need to be revised later to reflect our eventual decisions on Civil Service manpower after 1984.    I shall be making proposals about this later on.OVERALL EFFECT OF THE PROPOSALS .     If my proposals in Annex A are accepted, we shall have succeeded in keeping within our published expenditure plans. This has not been done by any Government since 1977, when the reduction followed the intervention of the International Monetary Fund in the previous year.ANNOUNCEMENT OF DECISIONS7- I propose that the announcement of these decisions as part oi the autumn Statement by the Chancellor should, as last year, contain brief descriptions of the changes to programmes, together with a summary, for 1983-84 only, of the revised programme and Planning totals and such other statistical information as can be Provided in the time available.    Full details of the revised programmes for all years will be provided in the Public Expenditure White Paper, which we hope to publish rather earlier than last Vear, at the end of January or early in February.CONCLUSION8- I believe the solutions arrived at in our bilateral discussions are reasonable, striking a fair balance between competing demands.    We shall be able to show that we have met the most urgent needs and fulfilled our commitments, while sticking to the expenditure plans we announced last year.9*     I therefore invite my colleagues;a. to approve, subject to any technical revisions of detail, the expenditure programmes in Annex A, the external financing limits for the nationalised industries in Annex B and the proposals for Civil Service manpower in Annex C, andb. to agree that our decisions should be announced as above (paragraph 7).LBasury Chambers October 19823SECRET
