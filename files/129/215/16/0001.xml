One way of doing this is by ^g&apos; public sector operations completely: we have made good progress in this, and ls Planned.   Other tasks must remain in the public sector, but there is no reason whyatisied be done by public servants. It is often more efficient to &apos;contract out&apos; such task e enterprise. But only by sustained effort can we achieve the progress that is ln this direction.   I wrote to Cabinet colleagues in the summer asking for theirPatChy,allsu8gestions. I have received some worthwhile proposals, but the results are still 1 now want to make a further search for suitable candidates and enlist the supporty Cabinet colleagues. tOut?Jence both in this country and in the United States has shown that the privateMl^hai/ Wlth the stimulus of the   profit motive, can very often undertake operations on     G vernment more cheaply than the Government itself.   This in turn establishes nesses with a potential for expansion including expansion overseas.  It is true atto 4t*te busiV      and at local level, in the Health Service and probably also in nationalised industries, the ti&gt;p esent system was not designed to encourage contracting-out, and it needs a majorhito lftrachieve it.  I am not, of course, urging wholesale contracting-out at any price: butumber of cases it will show a clear economic advantage.CO;titi-actedfoment&quot;r the stimulus of tight manpower targets, several functions have already beenout.

In a parallel paper C(82)40, the Chief Secretary ^ade proposals for the control of Civil Service numbers after 1984., He suggests a major th zrnental exercise in the New Year to identify the scope for further reductions. In0Urse  f that operation we should identify the scope for furthe-r contracting-out ofgovernment functions, and decide how to follow it up. The results are to be reportedk to CaVaoinet in May 1983.   This will also be a convenient opportunity to take stock on cl ig-out generally.MrI have discussed this with the Secretary of State for the Environment.   There has eady be     i  u0 n legislation in this Parliament to ensure that Direct ILabour Organisationson equal terms with private sector contractors.  There is scope for extending this *CiPle, butwe must expect considerable opposition from local authorities, with someu. c ~operate.

(confidential)a.c.The VAT anomaly applies only to the National Health service and central government departments. Local authorities already have VAT refundled to them. Nationalised industries recover it through their prices. I intend to. legislate m the next Finance Bill to allow the Treasury to make an order refunding VAT to government departments and the National Health Services, wheere specific operations or groups of operations are contracted out. This will remove the present disincentive to such action.Atrial relations. There is no doubt that the unions, particularly in the NHS the Civil Service, will resist any major extension of contractimg-out. We already expect trouble in one or two government departments. Otbviously the NHS exercise cannot be launched until the present pay dispute is rescolved; but in general, I think we must face up to these difficulties as they arise.Managerial obstruction. There is understandable reluctance on :the part of managers to give up any part of their functions. We must take every opportunity ^ counter this by pointing to the efficiency gains which have already been secured in some areas by greater use of the private sector. Some of these issues a&quot;ect all four sectors, and the Departments concerned wiM need tto remain in cl se touch and exchange experience as the operation proceeds.
