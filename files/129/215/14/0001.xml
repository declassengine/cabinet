CONFIDENTIALS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(82) 39 COPY NO 829 November 1982CABINETCABLE POLICY Memorandum by the Secretary of the Cabinetl  The Sub-Committee on Telecommunications Policy of the MinisterialCommittee on Economic Strategy (E(TP)) considered on 18 and 23 November a report on cable policy by the Official Group on Cable Systems. This made recommendations on the report on cable systems by the Information Technology Advisory Panel published on 22 March, and on the report on the broadcasting aspects of cable by the inquiry under Lord Hunt of Tanworth which was published on 12 October.2-      E(TP) reached a number of conclusions subject to consideration by the Cabinet.    The Annex contains a summary of these conclusions and  f those decisions that remain to be taken.3      The Sub-Committee agreed that,  in order to give potential investors as early an indication as possible of the Government&apos;s intentions, it would be desirable for the main decisions taken to be announced in the debate on cable systems in the House of Commons on 2 December. These announcements might then be reflected and reinforced in the Prime Minister&apos;s speech at the Barbican Information Technology Year Conference on 8 December.    Full details would be set out in a White Paper to be Published in the early months of next year.    This would take into account the recommendations of the Technical Working Group on Cable standards established by the Department of Industry.    In the course of the debate there would be an opportunity to test Parliamentary reaction to the Proposal that, in advance of legislation to provide for a statutory cable authority, an Advisory Committee might be set up as a shadow authority.    If the reaction was favourable, a proposal to this effect &quot;light be included in the White Paper for subsequent endorsement by Parliament.E(TP) therefore agree,  subject to the views of the Cabinet, that the Home Secretary might, in opening the debate on 2 December, announce trie following broad policy decisions -a. that the Government for the most part accept the Hunt recommendations, including certain safeguards for public service broadcasting, although some aspects will need further consideration;b. that a new statutory cable authority, other than the Independent Broadcasting Authority, will need to be established to award franchises and exercise oversight over programmes and other services, with a light regulatory hand;]CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALc. that although legislation will not be feasible within the current Session, a White Paper will be issued in the early part of next year setting out the proposals for legislation;d. that the Government will welcome the views of Parliament on the steps which might be taken in advance of legislation, including the setting up of an Advisory Committee as a shadow cable authority.5. An opportunity might also be taken at an appropriate stage in the debate to make known some other main decisions notably -e.v     that the choice of cable network, design, etc should be left primarily to the market; but ducts for new systems should be suitable for eventual installation of &quot;switched-star&quot; systems; and some incentives (eg longer licence periods)  should be granted for more advanced systems;f. that cable systems should be allowed to offer locally all services  (except voice telephony)  in competition with British Telecom (BT) and Mercury; but BT and Mercury should be freeto compete for the roles of sub-contractor, cable provider or, in association with others,  cable operator.ROBERT ARMSTRONGCabinet Office 29 November 19822CONFIDENTIAL

This would simplify procedures for the applicant and provide better means of adjudicating competing applications.Hunt recommends 10 years initially and 8 years subsequently.   But 12 years initially (and 8 years subsequently) would better fit recommendation on licences at 3 below.Hunt makes no proposal.   Official Group recommend 20 years for switched systems and 12 years for tree and branch systems.   This would provide reasonable period for latter and positive incentive for former.Other bodies (eg OFT, OFTEL) will have locus in some aspects of cable regulation. Further consideration will need to be given to the precise division of responsibilities.Hunt recommends that some initiative on bidding for franchises for particular areas should be taken by applicants.   But there may be case for requiring cable authority to draw up and publish a broad indicative map for franchise area as initial guide to prospective investors.Hunt recommends that, in order to avoid undesirable monopoly power, no individual company should have controlling interest. But, if this principle is accepted, there is a case for debarring control by media consortia as well as individual companies, and confining restriction to areas where companies operate.Hunt recommends against requirement for a &quot;full range and balance&quot; of programmes either within a channel or across a system as a whole, although cable authority should take range of programmes into account in awarding franchises. Is this acceptable?   To impose such a requirement would make programmes less profitable and reduce the chance of development of new systems financed by entertainment programmes.Hunt recommends that ordinary broadcasting taste and decency standards should apply to cable, except in relation to subscriptionCONFIDENTIAL
