ECONOMIC SCENARIOS i, lne3tPenditu COnsidering the longer term implications of the Government&apos;s public ^vityt .  *e stance, the report first adopts a set of assumptions about produced cont-    . 10n  growth and unemployment which would represent a substantial u       nS improvement on our recent national economic performance. Ulnpti     ari  A.    Its principal features are set out in Annex 1. The restraint nS are tnat inflation will fall and remain at a modest level, that wage tek^ildin&apos; C mDined with lower tax rates and interest rates, permit rapid eC nomic^  * I&gt;ro^t margins, that productivity continues to grow well, and that [6cently DfrOWtk w*** as a result be sustained at a level well above what has 11  Ur aff^611 ackieved.

They are hypotheses, not forecasts; it would in obt&apos;|CUlar be a mistake to suppose that a prediction of the future can be ade       by fitting the difference between them.    But they seem to cover an ke^d**6 ran8e oi possibilities against which to examine public expenditure nds in the light of the Government&apos;s objectives.7.t^0      These economic scenarios interact with public expenditure trends in ^ Wavs.    On the one hand assumptions on economic growth, inflation, coarPl yment&apos; interest rates, productivity and earnings growth are needed to seq       pr grammes.    On the other hand the taxation and interest rate con-ecq   nces of public expenditure have implications for the supply side of the Scen my and for employment and productivity.    The presumption underlying gro a*io A is that expansion of the private sector provides the main engine for in t the econ my a d that this expension would be promoted by reductionsproaXaUon and interest rates and hence in total public expenditure as a POrtion of GDP.PUBLIC EXPENDITURE PROJECTIONS8,the G   In making the public expenditure projections it has been assumed that ptiv 0vernment will continue to constrain the size of the public sector by beena   ation and restraint on expenditure.    Firm intentions to privatise have aubstreffected in the expenditure figures, but no account has been taken of any e*nB antial further privatisation.

(Social security benefits, for example.is Jasin_su a88u*ned to increase by less than earnings.)   International evidence sgesta tftat this demand c )uld increase on a significant scale. TheP*ov?,,nment is not obliged to meet it and may decide to divert it into privately PeH^ed services.    But the scope for such diversion is limited over this *elati      And l0Cal authority expenditure, although projected to continue its Ve decline, may continue to be difficult to control.^ sh   The Pr Jections have been combined with the two economic scenarios pt0  W what could happen to public expenditure as a proportion of GDP.

Alternatively, there could be pr 5^ for more public expenditure to accelerate the process of econom1 adaptation.

Financial targets are in place for most of the lQdustries, the main current exceptions being loss-makers such as the National Coal Board, the British Steel Corp- ration and British Shipbuilders.   The British Railways ^Oerd at present only has financial targets covering ^ea-link, the Inter-City services and the freight business.es-makers in most cases have a long-term duty to break ev&lt;* after grant. Improvements in efficiency both as a result of closer 8crutiny by the Government and the Monopolies and Mergers ^0nunission, and through greater competition.   The setting ^d monitoring of performance aims will also have a part to Play.Ui)JTivati sation of both whole industries and individual activities and assets.   By the early 1990&apos;s it is reasonable t^ s-ssume that the whole of British Airways, and parts of ha6 Britisil steel Corporation and British Shipbuilders, will ^   e been returned to the private sector, in addition to theBritish Transport Docks Board and Britoil (which are expected Privatised within the next year).   British Telecom mayto bealso have been privatised, although this is still subject to sub ^htial uncertainty. Where an industry or activity with a P 8itive external financing requirement is being returned to the Private sector, this will lead to continuing reduction in Public expenditure; but most privatisation candidates areCONFIDENTIAL
profitable and have small or negative external financing requirements.   In these circumstances, there will be continuing net benefit to the Exchequer after the orig1 sale has been made.   The proceeds from sale will gen ^ be counted as part of the special asset disposals progr and so will have no net effect on total external fin0110 for the nationalised industries.16.2     Cmnd 8494 carried these policies forward on the DasiSJged forecast reduction in total external finance for the nationa industries from  2.?bn in 1982-83 (before adjustment for   g^5-of the National Insurance Surcharge reduction) to  2.1bn in gUJttptiolJ This expected improvement is also associated with a modest re of economic growth.Long-Term Prospectsin16.3     Forecasts of the difference between industries&apos; total revenues and expenditure in cash terms are subject to greater . uncertainty than are forecasts of other items of public exp*n&amp;1 e even the later year plans in Cmnd 8494 are subject to large m*^ of error.   Forecasts for the early 1990&apos;s cannot give more tha0 rough indication of possible changes.   However, assuming the continued implementation, and success, of the Government&apos;s P U the following general picture emerges:i)     Investment     The level of investment will depend part on economic growth.   But many of the industries excess capacity at present;    in others current invest** may well be occurring to save costs rather than inC t efl* capacity;    in yet others output levels and hence inveS may be more or less invariant to economic growth. ? r example, the electricity industry currently has a l*rg &apos; quantity of spare capacity;   NCB output may be invarl^egt to growth, and the Gas Corporation may well need to in^gt-more with higher growth.   Whether the real level of inment changes significantly may well depend above ^changes in technology - eg in the energy sector. -total nationalised industry investment is unlikely ^ very much in real terms from its present level. j* purpose of this paper a reasonable assumption is
CONFIDENTIAL will remain constant.ii)     Internal resources   Assuming some modest continuation of economic growth, continued restraint on current costs and improvements in efficiency, the industries&apos; internal resources should increase steadily, although even this judgment is hazardous.   For example, price competition -itself aimed at improving efficiency - would tend to reduce the industries&apos; operating profits.   Movements toward economic Pricing may in any event he more or less complete by the mid-19808.iii)     External financing     In the absence of a major increase in investment, and assuming that the industries&apos; internal resources continue to improve following the implementation Of the Government&apos;s policies, the nationalised industries&apos; external financing requirements should continue to decline gradually.   Within the total, finance for the two main loss-makers (the National Coal Board and British Rail) - already responsible for threequarters of the nationalised industries tQtal external finance in 1981-82 - will remain predominant. 111 turn, grant would probably account for the majority of nationalised industry external finance, as is planned for 1982-83.   Butlhe pattern depends particularly heavily on the future of British Telecom.   If the industry remains in *he public sector, and has a continuing large investment Programme, there could well he a large external financing requirement - perhaps as high as  500m.ot      The projections assume continued implementation and success l* thVernment policies in a11 industries and the picture they show Of i Ua arguably an optimistic one.   Some account needs to be taken ^J^^ant risks - for example that growth will be lower than ^ftCted&apos; that hoped-for improvements in efficiency will not fully *t p^alise    and that world energy prices grow more slowly than i^Uat8ent Projected.   Adverse developments even in one or twories could well cause the outturn to be significantly worse P*Qv.^he total of the individual industry figures implies. To *&amp;4U  * a more realistic view of the prospect for nationalised*ie8 as a whole, a contingency margin of  300m - not allocated

The speed of moves in *nlS direction will only partially depend on UK economic growth and steel demand, and the  /DM exchange rate (European steel priceS are effectively denominated in DM).

CONFIDENTIALBritish Airports AuthorityThe BAA is in normal circumstances self-financing but this will not be possible during the proposed major expansion of its South East airports.   On the present timetable the major part of the expenditure on this programme is not expected to be completed until 1990 at the earliest.   Depending on the growth of traffic the programme could be extended into the mid-1990s.

Borrowing, on the other hand, Is a* a historically low level, due to the historically low levels of investment which result from the Board&apos;s decision to restrict capital expenditure to reduce their need for external finance.The future level of both grant and borrowing will depend on ability to restrain their current costs.
