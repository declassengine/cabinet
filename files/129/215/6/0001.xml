CONFIDENTIAL5.     In considering major options, we suggest that Ministers wish to measure them against several objectives:-(i) to improve incentives by reducing the burden of taxatio 1(ii) to increase freedom of choice;(iii) to ensure that those who demand public services apPre their cost by requiring them to pay;(iv) to allow increasing demands to be met by market sources rather than constrained by public expenditure limits,(v) to maintain or increase efficiency;(vi) (as a minimum) to reduce the nominal total of public(Thisexpenditure, even without any of these consequencemight well be dismissed as &quot;cosmetic&quot;, but two pos are discussed in Annex C.)sibili^633wed, weIf Ministers decide that any options should be fully revie   suggest that part of the purpose of the review should be how they measure up to these broad objectives.   The followi*1 ^eSi paragraphs outline a broad approach to each of the four m      ^ ji i  and suggest options for review; those are discussed in more Annexes D-K.Healthnci more6.     As living standards rise, individuals are likely to dam- t and better health care.   There is some social gain from imp (inCo e&apos;hoicescare, but mainly it is a matter of individual wants andfor puDielastic demand).   Hence it is arguably not appropriate 1        _ a d.

It is therefore worth considering whether over a jy ld sil ^ provision of health care for the bulk of the population ^Qgefrom the State to privately owned and run medical facilitie gtatei+ bycould no&quot; afford to pay would then have their charges me       ^ ^via some form of rebating or reimbursement.

CONFIDENTIAL8.       m. ,would mean leaving to individuals how far they insured^gainst facing high costs of health care, and it would be importantmoviitor the growth of private health insurance over the interveningp riod.   Given that the State would in the last resort meet the costs&lt;=osary health care, there could be a danger of under-insurance hy a laarge part 0f ^.ne wording population, and thought might therefore have i ,O- be given to a scheme for compulsory private insurance.Ministers accept the broad concept as a longer-term objective, they wii -iwant to judge more immediate health options as steps along &apos;the road ta,u*   in particular they will want an examination of how far the switch f-nrom public to private provision of health care could be ^Hoted, and whether they are any institutional changes, within the&apos; which could make this switch easier. 10. There has been a departmental review of health service financing^ ns earlier this year.   But in this broader context there might be a ease fntor a fuller review of two options, as stages towards the  nSer-term objective:-)   increased and extended health charges (Annex D)  Private health insurance (Annex E)The demand for education, as for health, is likely to be &quot;income-~ as living standards rise, people will want to spend a higher 0r&quot;tion of their income on more and better education for their  and will be increasingly frustrated by the lack of any way of cnoice effective within the State primary and secondarysystem, t*   m addition, however,&apos; there is a social interest, arguably heater thanan m health, in the quality and quantity of education,  ecause ti_ tnese will determine the capacity and versatility of the nextn of working people.   Hence in our judgement it is probably t real -i +  Pri     . ^  envisage, even as a long-term option, the wholesalew       lsa&quot;tion of provision for education in schools.   However, it &quot;mayhe desirable to make higher education more market-oriented, giving ^e cho ice to consumers and making the system more responsive to theueeds of wi.ooth students and employers.12. Hee therefore assume that the State will ccntinue to providetacilities for children of primary and secondary school age, 3ect   be c ncerned about quality.   But the parallel system of private-schooling will remain, and may expand with increasing prosperity.
CONFIDENTIALMore parents could be encouraged to choose the private sector, at * ^margin, by schemes for vouchers or tax relief; but if such schemes s^-relieve parents of part of the cost of education, they are hound t expensive for the taxpayer.   Hence as radical options for schoolseducation, Ministers may wish to consider a substantial reduction ihasresources going to the public sector (Annex P), or compulsory ca 0 for schooling (which could be combined with vouchers - Annex 0)  higher education (where most of the provision is already Privat6^]t 0f though publicly financed) an option might be to charge the full tuition (Annex H).Social Security13. The present system indexes most benefits to prices, and a ^large number of beneficiaries (9m pensioners, 3m unemployedthe real value of their benefits preserved, even at times whenworking population has to suffer a cut in living standards.probably cannot avoid recognising preservation of real value as ^benchmark (as for tax thresholds).   But it could avoid any conUDl,  firsto prolong the link between benefits and prices, and take &amp; legislative opportunity to break the link.   With inflation doWB much lower level, the assurance of full protection is arguably ^ ^ necessary.   Given discretion to hold benefits below inflate&quot;&apos; 1 make a once-for-all cut as a contribution to reducing the tax u It would also, of course, have discretion to allow beneficial share in increased prosperity when economic conditions imp*0*8&apos; increasing benefits ahead of prices.   This option is discussed Defence14. The United Kingdom has been struggling to maintain its NAT ^ commitment, when many other NATO members have not done so. ^ of defence spending in GDP in the UK is among the highest, and. arguably reflects some failure in the UK to adjust to poor eco ^ performance and a reduced role in the world.   There are seriouS complex issues here which Ministers may wish to consider:- th f&quot;air- could there be greater emphasis on mutual defence *ri sharing arrangements? ^- should there be a link between European defence (BAOR) EC budget negotiations?- if a reduced role has to be accepted, does this have implications for PCO and aid spending as well as4CONFIDENTIAL ^^^^
CONFIDENTIALSome of* +V\u-l xnese issues go outside the defence area and are mentioned nnex A.   Within the defence field, the main option would be to halt the real growth of defence spending after 1985/86-(Annex K). S^neraln the major options there are some general points to make:-(a)  ie options may lead to an increase in the amount of real resources (including labour) devoted to these services. Charges for education and health, for example, might have the effect of increasing the resources consumed by those services, if people chose to buy more of them.   So long as the services are provided within the public sector, we think that Ministers will wish to See the claim which they make on resources reduced.   But where People choose to pay more for private sector services, they should be free to do so.Some of the options would involve higher charges for services,and these raise difficult questions about incentives. Assumingno change in the existing tax and social security systems,barging for the full cost of services would cause a massiveredistribution of income, in general away from families toPeople without children.   This would exacerbate poverty to alevel which we assume Ministers would judge unacceptable. Tothe extent that it is desired to adjust for these effects,changes in the charging, benefit or tax systems would be needed.&apos; charges were rebated or reimbursed to those below some incomethreshold, the inevitable result would be high marginal &quot;tax&quot;rates at the bottom of the scale.   This adverse effect on theincentive to find a job or earn more would offset the gain fromlower direct tax rates made possible by the expenditure saving.^0vai of graduated income support, probably requiring a fullyln egrated system for combined tax and benefits, would bePreferable; but even then there might be little or no overallSain in incentives, though the effect would be distributed moresmoothly up the income scale.   If minimal charges for schooling0r health insurance were compulsory, they would only reduce thea gregate burden of taxation in a nominal sense; but they could all w more people to make their own decisions at the margin (analog0us to a shift from direct to indirect taxation).
CONFIDENTIAL(c)   Some of the options would make some people worse off&apos;is very difficult - in many cases impossible - to effectBut i*in the role of Government v/ithout making some people wor+ &apos;on &amp;particularly where public expenditure and hence taxa ^iflTi involved.   It is therefore necessary to accept that P ^.yit*whilst always recognising that it is the proper function of Government to ensure that no-one is made so much wo that he or she is subjected to undue hardship.   If p0verty 15thought of as a relative condition, adverse redistrihuti become hard to accept.
