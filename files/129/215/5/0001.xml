But in crude &quot;ready reckoner&quot; terms what &gt;5 implied is, at the least:orOD5or- raising the basic rate of income tax to about *5P (more if the tax base were reduced through evasionor disincentive effects). Deductions of tax ^ NIC together would then be over 5&gt;0 per cent on a marginal   of income for nearly all taxpayers.- abolishing all allowances other than the single allowance (e.g.    the married man&apos;s allowance, mortgage tax relief, relief for pension contri^1 and life assurance) and raising tbe basic rate to perhaps 33p.- raising VAT to 25% and doubling the real level of al specific duties.*or     -     levying VAT at 25% on goods which now bear the 1* rate and those now zero-rated (food, fuel&apos;, &amp;tc&apos;&apos;&apos;ConclusionsvideThe P^jections are, as stressed above, subject to * margin of error.    But they demonstrate the difficulty of financing the levels of public expenditure implied by tne continuation of current policies.    If the economy grows vetf^. slowly, as in scenario B, the conseouences for taxation ^ borrowing are very serious.    The economy would need to ^ steadily and strongly, as in scenario A, to permit the s  expenditure levels envisaged.    It is doubtful whether tfc^ growth could arise without any further Government actio* improve work incentives or to improve businesses pr fit8^ot through tax cuts.   But if taxes were cut borrowing could ^ be restrained to 2% of GDP&apos;- and the inflation and interest assumptions would begin to look implausible.i
