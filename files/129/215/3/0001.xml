CONFIDENTIALPS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(82) 28 COPY NO &amp;3&gt;8 July 1982CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE:  OBJECTIVES FOR 1982 SURVEY Memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury1. We now need to start considering the public expenditure programmes for 1983-84 and the two following years.    The Report of the Public Expenditure Survey Committee (PESC) which gives the material is available in Departments.THE AIM2. The aim which I propose is to hold to the present planning totals, that is, for 1983-84 and 1984-85 the cash totals for the aggregate of programmes plus contingency reserve which we agreed last November and published in the March White Paper, as modified by the decisions announced in the Budget and with som&lt; minor estimating changes.    For 1985-86 there is no cash programme yet. In discussion of colleagues&apos; programmes for that year, consistently with the aim I am suggesting for the previous years, I propose to aim for the total currently shown in the PESC baseline,3. The present planning totals for 1983-84 and 1984-85 stand at  120. 5 billion and  127.7 billion.    These totals include the additions of 7 billion and  5 billion respectively which we agreed last year on top of the previous plans which had been converted to cash using general inflation factors of 6 per cent and 5 per cent.    For 1985-86, the PESC baseline is  133. 3 billion.4. To hold to these plans should leave room for modest tax reductions next year, which could benefit industry and aid economic recovery.    The economic prospects are discussed in the separate paper C(82) 27 by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    We must beware of new commitments which would add to our problems after the next Election.THE PROBLEM IN 1983-845. To achieve the aim of holding the planning totals will be difficult.    We a accommodate some limited additions to certain programmes by committing now some of the contingency reserves of  4 billion for 1983-84 and  6 billion for 1984-8 5,    But we must keep an adequate reserve for unforeseen contingencies.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe need to do this has of course been particularly vividly demonstrated by the Falklands experience.    At the beginning of the current year 1982-83 we had a reserve of  2.4 billion, and already it is clear that we shall find it hard to live within this.6. For 1983-84 we have to recognise the probability of a substantialincrease in local authority current spending, simply because, even with a very tough Rate Support Grant settlement, we have no means of preventing some increased spending occurring, however much we may deplore it.    In addition it looks as if our statutory social security commitments will cost  0. 6 billion more than is allowed for in current plans.    Including these amounts, the proposals put forward so far during the preparatory work for the Survey already amount to about  6 billion extra for 1983-84 and about  7. 75 billion for 1984-85; a summary of the main items is at Annex.    The Falklands will require certain additions to present programmes.    So holding the planning totals will mean offsetting savings in some programmes,INFLATIONThis year&apos;s Survey is the first to be carried out in cash at all stages. As I have indicated, the baseline figures originally incorporated an overall provision for inflation (pay and other prices together) of 6 per cent in 1983-84 and 5 per cent in 1984-85,    The latest forecast for overall inflation, not just in the public sector, is about 7 per cent for 1983-84, but I shall report any revision in September,    No precise forecast can usefully be made for later years, but it will remain our firm objective that the rate of inflation should continue to decline.    In these circumstances I propose no general revaluation of the cash programmes.    In the case of public services pay, which we have discussed separately, we shall certainly want to aim at very much lower figures, and it will be necessary later in the year to ra-view the relevant programme figures,CIVIL SERVICE MANPOWER8. The PESC Report this year sets out the approved and proposed manpowei figures for each Department.    We are on course to achieve and hold the 1984 target of 630, 000 civil servants.    The position is tight.    Any significant increases above what is now proposed would frustrate achievement of the 1984 target.    There is no room for any new initiatives with sizeable manpower implications in the lifetime of this Parliament.9. I propose that we now regard the figures in the Report for 1 April 1984 as firm limits in the next stages of the Survey.    Within these limits, I will take UP points with colleagues where some further reduction seems possible by April 1984 or where their figures for April 1983 seem too high to leave a feasible last step to their target for April 1984.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCONCLUSION10.        I invite the Cabinet:1. To agree that our aim should be to hold to the present planning totals for expenditure in 1983-84 and 1984-85.2. To note that this means only the minimum inescapable additions to programmes in the course of the current Survey, and requires reductions in certain programmes in order to leave room for these inescapable additions.3. To agree that the Civil Service manpower totals for 1 April 1984 proposed in the report should now be regarded as firm limits.4. To agree that within the general framework of 1. and 2. , should hold bilateral discussions with spending Ministers about additions and reductions to their programmes and report back to Cabinet in October.L BTreasury Chambers 8 July 19823CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIALIntroductionPublic Expenditure 1983-84 to 1985-86 1982 Report by the Public Expenditure Survey CommitteektroductionI- This interdepartmental report by officials brings together most of the detailed factual and analytical material which provides the basis for the 1982 public expenditure survey. It excludes the options for reductions and offsetting savings, the material on which is not being distributed generally, though it is available to the departments concerned. A separate report will deal with the financing requirements of the nationalised industries.2.Each Departmental chapter sets out:(i)(ii)(iii)the plans in cash for the years up to 1984-85. These are taken from the March 1982 White Paper, adjusted for the changes announced in the Budget, for any agreed minor switches and for classification changes. This forms the baseline for the survey. Any subsequent Ministerial decisions are shown below the baseline as agreed changes.initial figures for the new final year of the survey, constructed mechanically by increasing the 1984-85 figures for each Department by 4 per cent. The only exception is defence, where the 1985-86 figures reflect Ministers&apos; decision to aim for a further 3 per cent real growth in that year.any reduced requirements and proposals for additional expenditure.Although the guidelines agreed by Ministers required (except in the case of ence)  the  submission  of  full  offsetting  savings  for  additional bids  and the Ppropriate options for reductions, these requirements have not been complied with in a^ cases. Further, many of the proposed savings offered are simply unrealistic.4. o manpower, Departments&apos; bids for staff for 1 April 1984 total 628,500 - some  500 below the announced target of 630,000.    Thereafter the totals continue to de llne to 624,700 at 1 April 1985 and 622,400 at 1 April 1986.   These figures areC0NFIDENTIAL
IntroductionCONFIDENTIALgenerally satisfactory. The bids for 1 April 1983 (656,000) are however too high and significant reductions will need to be sought in the 1983-84 Estimates scrutiny.5. Excesses and shortfalls on announced targets for 1 April 1984 for each of the main Departments are shown in the programme chapters. Additional savings in some Departments make it possible to accommodate the overshoots within the 630,000 target - subject to there being no change in the defence figures as a result of the Falklands conflict, and no significant upward shift in the unemployment assumptions.6. A separate chapter (28) is included this year drawing together the material on local authority current expenditure relevant for rate support grant. Material on local authority current expenditure is also included in the appropriate Departmental chapters. However the expenditure sub-groups have not yet finalised their work, which is not therefore fully reflected in the report. This omission is pointed out in the text where necessary.i7. Supplementary analyses are also included. Annexes A to D aggregate the information described in the previous paragraphs to show the position for public expenditure as a whole, including the broad economic analysis (including the construction element). Annexes E and F provide background information on public service manpower and local authority expenditure.8. The assumptions about unemployment underlying the figures in this report are unchanged from those in the White Paper.

1.   Ministry of DefenceCONFIDENTIAL3. The manpower requirements reflect the planned reductions in both Service and civilian personnel announced in Cmnd 8288, the savings from which are taken into account in the Cmnd 8494 figures. Because of the Falklands conflict, adjustments, eg to the planned rundown of Service personnel and dockyard capacity, are now inevitable.4. The MOD will formulate bids in due course for additional funds to cover extra costs arismg directly from operations in the South Atlantic. Furthermore, the conflict creates a new situation with major military and political implications, which the MOD foresee will require significant increases in defence resources beyond the NATO 3 per cent aim.Additional bids by MOD5. The MOD makes additional quantified bids as follows:(a) MOD has sought an increase to the 1982-83 cash provision to allow for the cost of the 1982 armed forces and top salaries pay awards over and above the 4 per cent provision in supply estimates. The additional bid up to 1985-86 represents the carry-through of the 1982-83 bid in later years;(b) MOD consider that the provision made in Cmnd 8494 for 1983-84 and 1984-85 fell short of the NATO 3 per cent target. On the basis of the Budget forecast of general inflation the provision allowed for only about 1 per cent annual real growth in those years. In order to meet the Government&apos;s commitment to plan to implement the NATO 3 per cent target in full, additional cash is sought in 1983-84 and later years;(0 over the last 15 years defence non-pay prices, though fluctuating from year to year, have increased faster than overall prices on average. They are predicted by the MOD to rise faster than overall prices by an average of nearly 3 per cent a year over the survey period. Additional provision of this order is sought to ensure that the 3 per cent a year real growth, on which Ministers have agreed, can be achieved.6CONFIDENTIAL

In March Ministers decided that the regular aid programme to India would he increased from  82.5 million to  110 million in 1983-84. For 1984-85 and 1985-86 the Indians were offered assurances of &quot;best endeavours&quot; to increase aid to them with nofmention of specific sums. Ministers agreed that the bulk of the increased allocation  27.5 million to India in 1983-84 would be provided by an overall increase in the total aid programme because of other pressures on it then identified. The bids for 1984 and 1985-86 are the additions to the aid programme which are required if Minister wish to maintain aid to India at  110 million a year without further reductions i*1 programmes to other countries.10CONFIDENTIAL--
C^NPmENTIAL^^Reduced requirements*  In the Treasury&apos;s view, not accepted by ODA, there are reduced requirements of *0.6 million in 1983-84,  1.2 million in 1984-85 and  1.6 million in 1985-86 arising from th* treatment of pensions supplements - see paragraph 8 below.Overseas aid administration5.

Ministers have agreed that the CDC may borrow  15 million a year commercially overseas in 1982-83, 1983-84 and 1984-85, but have not yet considered whether borrowing will be allowed in 1985-86.

Subscriptions to international organisations account for about 90 per cent of this programme. It remains the policy of FCO Ministers to try to keep expenditure on these organisations at zero real growth and wherever possible to achieve real reductions.

4.   European CommunityCONFIDENTIAL2. Projections of United Kingdom net payments to the Community budget are subject to a wide margin of forecasting error. The government has only an indirect influence over the size of the EC budget and UK contributions to and receipts from it. Our net payments will also depend over the survey period on the outcome of the current negotiations over UK budget refunds. The net payment in the current year is now expected to be some  135 million more than foreseen in Cmnd 8494. This mainly reflects the new agreement of 25 May 1982 on UK budget refunds (see below). The net payments in 1983-84 and 1984-85 are now expected to be some  75-150 million less than m Cmnd 8494. This reflects revised estimates of Community budget expenditure and of the phasing of UK budget refunds.3. As in Cmnd 8494, the new projections assume that the Community will contain expenditure, in particular CAP guarantee expenditure, so as to keep the budget total within the 1 per cent VAT ceiling.4. The major development since Cmnd 8494 has been the conclusion of a new agreement on refunds for the United Kingdom in respect of the Community&apos;s 1982 budget. Cmnd 8494 assumed that the United Kingdom would receive each year net refunds equivalent to 66 per cent of our net contribution before refunds to the allocated budget. This assumption was based on the precedent set by the 30 May 1980 agreement. The new agreement for 1982 provides for the United Kingdom to receive net refunds of approaching  500 million during 1983 (55} per cent of the Commission&apos;s estimate of our net contribution in respect of the 1982 budget), with adjustments during 1984 if the Commission&apos;s estimate turns out to be wrong. In the Treasury&apos;s view, the Commission forecast is too low, and we ought to receive during 1984 a further  222 million of gross refunds in respect of the 1982 budget. On the assumption that we receive half of this extra sum before the end of March 1984, the effect of the new agreement will be to increase our net payments, by  236 million during 1982-83 but reduce it by  95 million during 1983-84 and by  20 million during 1984-85. These figures underlie the changes from the baseline, but have been modified by other changes to produce the net changes shown in Table 4.5. The level of our net refunds in respect of the 1983 and subsequent budgets will depend on the outcome of the continuing negotiations on a long term solution to the13CONFIDENTIAL

Expenditure by IBAP is incurred on market regulation under the Common^tural Policy (CAP). The main components are intervention buying and selling,production, storage and animal feed subsidies and payments on imports and   Almost all of it is mandatory under European Community (EC) Regulations^       s  is 100 per cent funded from the EC Budget. This programme covers IBAP&apos;sexpenditure, the associated receipts from the EC being credited to the EC progpamHe  (Chapter 4)  where  they serve  to  reduce  the United  Kingdom&apos;s net ion to the EC.    Expenditure is particularly unpredictable as it depends, a  on trade volumes, world commodity prices, exchange rates and day to dayPetatins of the CAP instruments of market management.conf ential21
5.   Intervention Board for Agricultural ProduceCONFIDENTIAL2. The Board&apos;s central and miscellaneous services expenditure is mainly in respect of the Board&apos;s staff costs and those of agencies undertaking work on its behalf.Implications of the baseline3. The figures provide for expenditure on the Board&apos;s various operations based on a view of market trends and world prices taken in September 1981. The figures provide for the continuation of the UK butter subsidy and the beef variable premium although these are subject to annual renegotiation.Additional bids4. The reduced requirements indicate the changes forecast before the CAP Pric fixing of May 1982. These include higher expenditure on purchases into intervention butter but lower expenditure on purchases of cereals and beef. Lower sales of cereals and beef were forecast mainly because of reduced stocks following lower than expected purchases in 1981-82.   Strong market prices led to reduced expenditure on the beef and sheepmeat variable premium schemes.5. With the exception of a very small part of the Board&apos;s expenditure increasedCAPprices result from the annual CAP price fixing.  Because of the nature of many schemes, however, there is no straightforward relationship between the percentag addition to support prices and the expenditure consequences.   An initial estimate the expenditure consequences of the price fixing decisions of May 1982 has been made, but for subsequent years it is not known what the average level of CAP &quot;price increases will be or how these will affect expenditure patterns. Hence at this stage has been assumed that expenditure in terms of 1982-83 prices will increase in line with the increased cash provision in the later years..      \wr some6. The CAP price fixing decisions of May 1982 increased CAP prices Dyr +he&gt; relevant10.5 per cent with the increases coming into effect at the beginning oitar thancommodity marketing years. The effect on expenditure is expected to be grea ^ the increase in cash provision allowed for between 1981-82 and 1982-83.

6.   Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and FoodCONFIDENTIAL6. It was agreed during the last survey that the provision for hill livestock compensatory allowances should be based on the money rates of allowance paid m 1982; these are due to be reviewed this autumn.7. The provision for MAFF wages and salaries is based on the manpower levels agreed for 1 April 1983 and from 1 April 1984 onwards. Provision is also made for the implementation of plans for contracting out or privatising certain areas of MAFF s work.8. Work is in progress to develop appropriate output measures in relation to capital grants, ADAS services and research and development expenditure.Estimating changes - reduced requirements and additional bids.9. Reduced requirements more than offset the additional bids which arise from the maintenance   of   existing   policies.      These   fall   largely   on demand-determined expenditure, for which forecasts are subject to change.  The main increases ar 1985-86 and relate to planning of expenditure on the replacement of MOD fisherie protection   vessels,   partly   financed  by   the  Agricultural  Departments, an replacement of a protection vessel operated by DAFS.Additional bidsCentral Marketing Organisation10.

From 1983-84 timber receipts are lower consequent upon a switch from working timber by FC own labour to selling it standing to timber merchants. The shortfall has been fully met by reductions in labour, machinery, materials, services and administrative expenses.5. A report on the Commission&apos;s management structure has been completed an decisions in principle will be taken later this year which may have an effect on the P^S provisions, particularly from 1984-85 onwards.Reduced requirements6. The policy of non-recruitment of labour except where absolutely necessary, and the switch in timber working, has led to a significant fall in numbers (mainly through natural wastage) giving rise to the reduced requirement set out.Additional bid*7. Private sector planting is expected to rise in 1985-86 above the level assumed m the existing baseline.

8.   Department of Industry CONFIDENTIALIntroduction1. The principal support measures under this programme are regional development grants, regional and national selective assistance, support for general industrial R and D, space technology and aircraft and aeroengine development, various shipbuilding measures, and support for BL and Rolls Royce.Implications of the baseline2. About half of the extra costs indicated by the additional bids listed in Table 8 arise from external factors, for example demand or the level of interest rates. The other additional bids principally concern launch aid which was not covered m Cmnd 8494 and more support for high technology. The extra funds allowed in the 1982 Budget &quot;innovation package&quot; have already been added to the Cmnd 8494 provision.3. Neither the White Paper nor the additional bids involve provision for financing BL and Rolls Royce beyond the end of 1982-83 but it will be difficult to avoid expenditure on such &quot;problem companies&quot;. Furthermore, no allowance is made for any further phase of the shipbuilding intervention fund beyond July 1983.Additional bids4. (i) Regional Development Grants (RDGs)Restoration is sought of the  50 million a year cut included in Cmnd 8494; Ministers subsequently agreed not to proceed with the changes to RDGs which had been proposed. In addition a bid for a further  80-90 million a year in 1984-85 and 1985-86 is necessary to cover increased demand apparently arising from a reversal in the previously downward trend in the share of UK investment going to the assisted areas. Finally a bid of  9 million a year is necessary following changes in Assisted Areas agreed by Ministers in June 1982.34CONFIDENTIAL
8.   Department of IndustryAjssisjtanc:e to Industry in Assisted AreasA bid0    10 million a year is needed to cover expenditure necessary to match the k  P sed ERDF assistance to small and medium-sized undertakings in areas affected Steo1&apos; shipbuilding and textile closures.(lll)Assjstanco to Individual IndustriesThisarises from the net effect of modifications in forecast expenditure under the^       support measures under this heading, (for example, slippage in support underow closed Selective Investment Scheme and an upturn in forecast support under the Micro- l&quot;electronics Industries Support Programme), provision for calls under the m*U Firmms Loan Guarantee Scheme, together with a loss in receipts arising from  ans havin lin. lapsed or having been repaid earlier. Additional expenditure of  7 million84 and  2 million in 1984-85 on the Small Engineering Firms Investment bch-eme ha ^ s been provided for by transfers  from  the  &quot;wedge&quot;  (see  (ix) below),ional provision is also sought for building up a public sector stockpile of certainatCgic mat  ^ materials to guard against future disruptions in supply;   the costs of a sixstockpilc are provisionally put at  27 million in 1983-84,  28 million in 1984-85 ^ muhon in 1985-86.^ British Technology Group (comprising the National Enterprise Board and the ^a^ ilalR.esearch Development Corporation) Ministersagreed in July 1979 to provide the NEB with a continuing  10 million a yearits r gional/small firms role and  140 million (cash) over the three years to  13 ltS high tcchnol gy role    The additional bids would allow the NEBfor mUll n&apos; E12 million and  10 million in 1983-84, 1984-85 and 1985-86 respectivelyhigh technology role. The NRDC finances will be seriously affected by the Sq^ k Wn 111 reccjipts on the expiry of its cephalosporin patents and extra funds arc thc q t0 Ina&quot;ltam its investment. All of these bids assume the current examination ofrPorate Plan of the British Technology Group results in approval of these plans.(v) c-  agientific and Technological Assistance (STAMG) This bid is m afor &quot;laae up of a number of components.  First, additional provision is soughtresearch0   . n establishments to cover extra expenditure, including renewing capital^UlPment f&gt; ror the National Maritime Institute which is shortly to be privatised; in!^^tiaT35
8.   Department of IndustryCONFIDENTIALaddition general economic conditions have contributed to forecast receipts for research establishments being lower. Second, additional provision is sought for industrial R and D, in particular to allow for the large potential expenditure on the IT87 project, formerly referred to as &quot;Fifth Generation Computers&quot;. Third, extra provision is sought for space technology, to cover commitments under the L-Sat (large communications satellite) programme in 1983-84 and an expansion of the &quot;national-space programme (as opposed to support through the European Space Agency).(vi) Finance for Rolls RoyceThe cancellation by Lockheed of its Tristar project, which used RB 211 engines, and the general recession in the airline industry have led to a sharp downturn in receipts to the Department through levies on sales of engines developed with Departmental support.(vii) Launch AidSubstantial support will be needed if various projects are to go ahead including the Westlands 30 helicopter, British Aerospace involvement in the A320, Rolls Royce participation in the RJ-500 engine, and the Rolls Royce development of the 535-E4 version of the RB 211.(viii) Assistance to the Shipbuilding IndustryAdditional provision is sought for refinance of home shipbuilding lending, for interest support costs and for assistance to shipbuilding via the Intervention Fund and the Shipbuilding Redundancy Scheme. Some loans under the (now closed) facility for Refinance of Home Shipbuilding Lending have been repaid early with consequent benefit to the PSBR in earlier years, and so receipts in future years will be reduced; of these bids, up to  8 million a year is related to the continuation in 1982-83 of the special early repayment scheme agreed by Minsters. Additional provision is sought to cover increases in interest support costs on Home Shipbuilding Lending, where interest rate assumptions have been increased, more than offsetting a reduction in forecast orders. The bids for assistance to shipbuilding reflect the agreed  40 million tranche of Intervention Fund assistance for the period July 1982 to July 1983, and the extension of the Shipbuilding Redundancy Scheme for two years from July 1983.

9.   Department of EnergyCONFIDENTIAL2. The provision for nuclear research and development in each year is some 6-11 per cent in equivalent cost terms below the 1982-83 provision. The reductions agreed to last year&apos;s plans have led to a cutback in work on the fast reactor, affecting the negotiations with potential partners for international collaboration, to limits on independent fusion research, and to the deferral of construction and refurbishment of plant and laboratories. Ministers are expected to take a decision this year on the future of fast reactor work. None of the options which they will be considering is likely to result in an additional bid during the period of the survey.3. The provision for operational and deficit grants to the coal industry is as published in Cmnd 8494 and is realistic only for 1982-83. Figures for subsequent years reflect the former financial strategy and do not take account of the change in policy since February 1981. The amount to be provided for future years will be considered in the Investment and Financing Review of the nationalised industries.4. The baseline provision for payments to redundant mineworkers was agreed last September on the assumption that about 7,000 men might be made redundant in 1981-82 following the improvements in benefits which took effect from March 1981. This would have been more than double the number of redundancies in 1980-81. In the event the National Coal Board was able to make some 10,000 men redundant in 1981-82 with consequential benefits for productivity and financial performance. Benefits under the redundancy scheme continue for 5 years or more so the increase in the number of redundancies last year requires additional bids of  15 million in 1983-84,  15 million in 1984-85 and  25 million in 1985-86. About  5 million a year should be offset by higher receipts from the European Coal and Steel Community which will be credited to programme 2.7. Associated, but smaller, additional bids of  2 million in 1983-84,  4 million in 1984-85 and  7 million in 1985-86 for social grants to the National Coal Board for pit closures etc result from the same increase in redundancies. These, unlike the redundancy payments, count towards the NCB&apos;s external financing requirements.5.     These figures are subject to considerable uncertainty since they depend not only on redundancies that have already taken place but  also on the  future rate redundancies.  No change is at present being made to last September&apos;s forecasts there would be an average of 5,500 redundancies a year in 1982-83 and subsequcn years. This assumption will need to be reconsidered later in the year.

Additional net bids of  1.7 million in 1983-84,  1.8 million in 1984-85 and 1.9 million in 1985-86 are required for the continuation of additional promotioneffort commenced in 1982-83 by both the British Tourist Authority and the EnglishTourist Board;   to restore BTA&apos;s purchasing power following losses due to exchangrate movements in previous years;   and to meet VAT liabilities for the Authority_    Via^is onthe Board arising from a recent Customs and Excise decision to alter theforwhich they are assessed. These additions are partially offset by reduced provisionassistance under Section 4 of the Development of Tourism Act 1969.   The Treasurynotes that funds for the additional promotional effort in 1982-83 were found fron hadsavings identified by the Department after the baseline was set.   The Treasury previously made it clear that this once-for-all adjustment had no implications expenditure in future years.   Secondly, BTA has been given authority to p forward foreign currency to minimise exchange rate losses.   The Treasury consi ^ that BTA should not be insulated entirely from market fluctuations.

10.   Department of Trade-xportpromotionAn additional requirement of  0.1 million in 1985-86 arises from an allowance forThe0Verseas Cost increases which has been built into the trade fair provision.

11.   Export Credits Guarantee Department CONFIDENTIALthebanks, and arrangements made with the Trustee Savings Banks.   The changes m timing of expected net receipts are due to the more accurate predictions which are being made as the scheme runs down.3. Expenditure forecasts for the interest support and cost escalation programmes must be tentative, since they are demand responsive and highly sensitive to changes m economic assumptions.4. The changes in interest support costs take account of recent changes in the sterling  exchange  rate,  interest  rate  expectations  and  the  latest estimates increasing outstanding export credits over the period. The increase in 1982-83 interest support costs is particularly affected by an expected increase in the volume 0 outstanding export credits of 16 per cent.5. It is estimated that the flow of exports supported by the fixed rate exp rt lending arrangements (items (i) and (ii) above) will be approximately  4.2 billi n 1111982- 83 and that this figure will rise to  4.3 billion,  4.9 billion and  5.5 billion 1111983- 84, 1984-85 and 1985-86 respectively.6. The cost escalation programme projections are affected by price increases an some delays in the signing of agreements under which premium income is mainly received in the earlier period.   The estimate relates to commitments made an expected to be made by 26 March 1983; Parliament recently approved an extension 0 the Department&apos;s annual authority to that date.7. The figure for the mixed credit matching facility is based on the existing provision for 1982-83 carried forward through to 1985-86.Manpower1.4.83 1.4.84 1.4.85 1.4-86(i) Manpower numbers inthe baseline 1845 1840 1840(ii) Net change (ie differencebetween baseline and bid) -(iii) Proposed manpower 4qrequirement 1845 1840 1840 18  (iv) 1.4.84 target - 1840(v) Claim on/credit tocontingency margin50CONFIDENTIAL

It also allows for the maintenance until March 1984 oAfterJob Release Scheme with eligibility ages of 62 for men and 59 for women.

13.   Department of TransportCONFIDENTIALIntroduction1. The Department of Transport&apos;s expenditure programmes relate mainly t0 England. Subsidies to British Rail and ports spending extend also to Scotland an&lt;* Wales, and driver and vehicle licensing throughout the UK.2. Cash limits are applied to the total of local authority capital expenditure} Government grants to local authorities; to the motorway and trunk road program036&apos; and to almost all DTp&apos;s other central spending.Motorways and trunk roads3. The priorities for the motorway and trunk road programme are: first, construction of roads which aid economic recovery and development; second construction of roads bringing environmental benefits;   third, preserving investm already made.4. As presently provided, the annual increase in cash for the programme, wnicn effect managed as a unit, is 4 per cent from 1982-83 to 1983-84; 6 per cent from 1983 84 to 1984-85; and 4 per cent from 1984-85 to 1985-86.Motorway and trunk road construction5. The programme in the Roads White Paper (Cmnd 8496) envisaged a rate o road construction as follows:Under construction at 1 April 1983 - 200 miles Opened during 1983-84 -        110 milesOpened during 1984-85 -        100 milesOpened during 1985-86 -        160 milesUnder construction at 31 March 1986     -        290 miles1083-84 t0Over 110 communities will be relieved of through traffic in the three years n  a   so the1985-86.    The M25 will be virtually completed by the end of the period, emphasis will switch to lower standard and less expensive roads.
ENTIAL13.   Department of Transport6.Most of the schemes take between 2 and 3 years to complete.  Once contracts let&gt; the rate of spending depends on the speed of work and the movement of costs.As _ ... i  _____       j.T. ^  m1mmost of the expenditure in any year is on contracts let in earlier years, the only  * managing the programme within the cash limit is by deferring the letting ofaew contract..7forThemost important factor affecting the level of output possible is therefore the ment  f costs.  Unit costs in 1981-82 were about 1} per cent below the average y j. ^e future trend is difficult to forecast. The Department&apos;s view is that a&quot;Hit  ^ U*)tUrn *s Ernest certain in the next 1 or 2 years. It estimates that the rise in c sts between average 1982-83 and average 1983-84 is likely to be in the range of to eight per cent; the rise in tender prices for new work would be higher. The0ne half Propects for later years are even more uncertain.8.GiasiaeVen this forecast, the Department believes that  560 million needs to be set ln 1983-84 to ensure the planned capital programme can be achieved. The the ls that it should be possible to achieve the desired output well within&gt;Hfo ^ Presently provided.    The position can be kept under review as further ation becomes available about movements in construction prices.Mot,9.const fututrec Th *Way 311(1 trunk road maintenanceterms of cost and purpose major maintenance schemes are similar to new tUction projects.

^CONFIDENTIAL 14.   Department of the Environment - Housing-*pitalexpenditure2. 18perare froThe provision for gross capital expenditure in 1982-83 ( 3190 million) is onlycent above the outturn for 1978-79 although costs in the economy as a whole^tirnated to have increased over the same period by some 65 per cent. The output111 housing capital expenditure has therefore fallen sharply: public sector housing startswere  down   from  93,000  in  1978   to  31,000  in  1981;  and  public sectorP 0vements down from 74,000 to 64,000.  An increase in forecast capital receipts^        es of council houses and the construction package in the 1982 Budget meantce   Planned gross provision for housing capital expenditure could increase by 10 perbetween 1981-82 and 1982-83.   In addition, there was a marked underspend inmainly because local authorities were uncertain about the likely level of capital  receipts so that gross provision in 1982-83 is some 30 per cent above outturn r 1981 8^ None the less the Department believes that there is a strong case for aer ^crease in 1983-84. The Department points particularly to(i)(ii)(iii)(iv)the need to follow through the momentum on home improvement that will gradually build up in 1982-83 as a result of the Chancellor&apos;s budget measures. If HIP allocations are cut back in 1983-84, discretionary improvement grants could be halted or drastically cut back in many authorities.the English House Condition Survey in England and Wales. The results of the survey which will be published later in the year may show significant deterioration in the state of the housing stock and to add to public demand for greater expenditure on home improvement.equally urgent needs for home improvement expenditure in the public sector. Many post-war dwellings constructed using industrialised methods (including Airey and Bison homes) are causing serious problems. Local authorities will need either to repair these dwellings or demolish them, rehousing the tenants. The Department does not believe that central government can stand back from the expenditure implications.the employment and materials industry benefits of public sector housing capital expenditure.ENTIAL
I %14.   Department of the Environment - HousingCONFIDENTIAL(v)     the fact that, in 1981-82, for the first time since the 1940s fewer homes were added to the stock than the estimated increase in households. Abou 180,000    dwellings   a   year   are   needed   to    maintain   the curren household/dwelling balance.    Although a large crude surplus of house remains, it includes second homes, and there are still shortages in areas which people want to move;    a surplus is needed for labour mobility Private sector completions could provide up to 120,000 dwellings a year 1982-83. The Department therefore believes that a continuing contribute0 of 60,000 houses a year is required from the public sector.  The Treasury points out, however, that private sector starts have increased since 19^ and that the private sector contribution could and should be considerab y+   in thegreater  in  the  mid 1980s;     a  temporary  adverse movement household/dwellings balance may be a necessary price to pay in the conte of the economic strategy as a whole.Current expenditure3.     Reductions  in housing current  expenditure have,  with the reduced capitprovision, made a major contribution to the Government&apos;s public expenditure saving^over the last four years.  This has been mainly because of the unprecedented rateincrease in rents: 26 per cent in 1980-81; 41 per cent in 1981-82; and a further 22 Pcent asked for in 1982-83 (although the Treasury notes that it is unclear whether locatakenauthorities will implement this increase in full).   These increases would have rents from the lowest post-war proportion of average adult male manual ear (7.0 per cent in 1979-80) to-the highest (10.5 per cent in 1982-83, if rents increase asked).   The Department does not believe that it is realistic to expect rents to much faster than the RPI in 1983-84.riseImplications of the present baseline1q82~834.      The present baseline for 1983-84 is 23 per cent below the provision for 1?. reducespartly because  of  the  ending  of  the  option  mortgage  scheme wnicnrequirements by some  300 million.   For the later years the baseline rises againwoul&quot;3.8 per cent in 1984-85 and 4 per cent in 1985-86.

The Department feels that an increase in the output from capital^xpejjtjjte should be allowed for, as in 1982-83 ie an increase of some 10 per cent in8r Ss cash^  ^      capital spending; and that rents should not be increased faster than prices.h usin,easury notes, however, the important contribution which reductions in the &apos;  programme agreed in earlier surveys make to the planning total for 1983-84. nerefore considers that a higher rent increase or a reduction in capital expenditure,or6.c mbination of both, will be necessary.andThiQo      6 level of expenditure on management and maintenance consistent with thea asehne rests on the assumption that costs would rise in line with surveyOptions   Tn_ ^K6 llle Department argues that management and maintenance costs should,      Culated by applying more realistic factors for cost increases between 1981-8283  (10 per cent for prices and 6 per cent for wages).   This requires ana  120 million of current expenditure;   the scope for savings being greatly ed, in tv,3} Department&apos;s view, at least in the short term by the extent to whichePair 3J.J .P&apos;obl lnadequate management of council estates are contributing to socialstrr        ^d ^e loss of rent income through voids and vandalism.   The Treasuryrguessystf7.esses v&gt;  nowever, the importance of controlling current expenditure in this field. It tllat the overspending should be penalised both through the housing subsidy 01       if necessary, through a reduction in capital expenditure.To &lt;jgQ      ^1Ve effect to these proposals, the Department estimates that an addition of ^dlion to the housing programme total in 1983-84 would be required. This69
14.   Department of the Environment - HousingCONFIDENTIALassumes that experience in 1982-83 will show that rents have been increaseent&apos;srequired in that year.    If not,  the  addition required to meet  the Departmobjectives would be higher still. It also assumes some reduction in receipts from sal, laterof land and council houses.  The Treasury notes that the bid does not cover tne years. But if the bid is accepted for 1983-84 the housing programme will again show marked downward swing in 1984-85.    The logic of the Department&apos;s bid points substantial increases in 1984-85 and 1985-86.   To maintain the level of output froD0 capital expenditure   implied by the Department&apos;s bid, while increasing rents in lin with prices would, the Treasury estimates, require increases of some  825 mill1011 1984-85 and  630 million in 1985-86 after allowing for the reduced requirements mentioned in paragraphs 8 and 9 below.Reduced requirements8. The cost of housing subsidies is largely dependent on loan charges paid from 1 basauthorities&apos; Housing Revenue Accounts, and hence on interest rates. The Treasuryagreed with the Department that the effect of changes in interest rates in hous&apos;f interestcurrent expenditure should be accepted as automatic. The latest forecasts oid 849^rates in 1983-84 and 1984-85 are slightly lower than the forecasts used for Cmna and the resulting agreed changes are shown in the table.    a Because9. For similar reasons the baseline for 1985-86 is higher them requirea.  interest rates forecast for 1985-86 are lower than those for 1984-85, an increase4 per cent in the baseline is not required to achieve the same levels of output&quot;  to Thisreduction of  200 million in the baseline for 1985-86 is therefore appropriate, would be consistent with rents and capital expenditure increasing by 4 pe between 1984-85 and 1985-86.70CONFIDENTIAL

Despite the additional  5 million a year agreed last December (to support schemes linked to immediate private sector development) a large number of other new local authority schemes are still awaiting approval, many of which are linked t0 industrial or commercial end-use and designed to attract developers by providin cleared sites.

The plans assume a faster cbntraction of the teacher force than the pro} decline in pupil numbers, weighted by age, between 1981-82 and 1984-85 (9-5 Per and 7.9 per cent respectively).  Some 40,000 teaching posts would need to be given in the period 1981-82 to 1984-85.    8,000 compulsory redundancies (costing  50 million within the plans) would be required even if authorities re-deployed surpteachers as far as possible and many teachers left under premature retire arrangements.ent7.     The overall pupil teacher ratio would worsen from 18.5 in 1981-82 to 1984-85 and remain in that range in 1985-86.

 onfidENTLAL19.   Department of Education and Science^    Additional school teachersThe Department considers that, on their present policies, local authorities are unlikely to reduce teacher numbers by more than 9,000 a year. This is because agreement on new terms for compulsory redundancies for teachers under 50 years old is not in sight and because authorities will in any event be reluctant to declare such redundancies. The bid therefore assumes that teacher numbers will exceed Cmnd 8494 assumptions and their projection to 1985-86 by 12-13,000 in 1983-84 and 1984-85 and 8,000 in 1985-86. Present plans assume that teachers will continue to be released for induction and in-service training at about the present level equivalent to 5,000 full-time teachers per year.   The Department considers substantial expansion   essential   to   secure   effective   teaching   (for   example of mathematics, science and technology) for the reduced teacher force and to meet new requirements arising, for example, from problems identified in Lord Scarman&apos;s Report and from implementation of the Education Act 1981 for those with special needs in ordinary schools.  To this end it envisages introduction of a new specific grant to education authorities for in-service training, by Regulations under Section 3 (a) of the Education Act 1962. The bid at (ii) (b) assumes this would result in further release equivalent to another 3,000 full-time teachers a year by 1984-85 (within the increased teacher numbers above).Voluntary schools, capitalThe Secretary of State is required by law to pay grant at 85 per cent of the cost of repairs at voluntary schools. The Department cannot control these costs directly. A voluntary rationing scheme has been introduced for small repairs in 1982-83, covering about 20 per cent of all repairs expenditure; by itself this will not be sufficient to contain total costs to the levels currently planned for later years.Higher ednratinnAdditional costs for universities, Open University, and voluntary collegesThis bids covers certain unavoidable additional commitments in higher education (mainly the universities) not covered by bid (i)^ENTIAL 101(iii)(iv)

The levels of provision in the table confirm the priority given within the over Northern Ireland programme to law and order, industrial support and housing-However, any addition under the formula will not fully cover the cost of the assumed settlement for police pay. This will further exacerbate the existing pressures on the law and order programme. Northern Ireland continues to face severe social and economic difficulties.

Factory closures continue to erthe base for subsequent recovery.    There are still many companies in vulnerasectors at risk of contraction or even closure.   The inflow of new investmentir&gt;eati nvirtually ceased and such projects as display interest in Northern Ireland as a io are inevitably extremely expensive.Additional bids4.

The need for special aid persists in the years beyond 1982-83 ^confirmation of the continuation of aid is necessary to give the industry the necesthe otherconfidence to plan future production and investment. It is not possible, givencurrentpressing social and economic needs in Northern Ireland, and especially the.Jorther11sensitive political climate, to reallocate finance for this purpose within the W Ireland programme without creating difficulties elsewhere.5.

In the 1981 survey the plans were raised substantially because overspending in 1981-82 meant in* Cmnd 8175 plans were undeliverable.   It was hoped that local authorities would more likely to reduce the extent of their overspending if the plans were pitcnea to the spending level in 1981-82.

C0I*FIDENTIAL28. Local authority current expenditure relevant for RSGu. InDoth years, Scottish local authorities overspent  more,  and Welsh local authority i^ ^      es less, than their English counterparts. Last year no grant was withheld fromlocal authorities because it was thought that outturn might be appreciably less &apos;nan bungets&gt; but in fact there was little shortfall. So grant reductions in 1982-83 wille&lt;l to^        take account of overspending in both years.   In Scotland  32 million of thePenalty for 1981 -82 was secured by selective action and the balance by general abateithe measures to be adopted for 1982-83 have yet to be decided. For &apos; u^e England, the abolition of supplementary rates holds out some hope that  grant may force expenditure reductions. In Scotland of course there has never power to levy supplementary rates.Grants12.   M, .i^e^      *sters agreed in March to plan AEG primarily in cash.

The components of the latter are shownexr, 6 detai1 in Table F2. The main difference between the PES definition of current ^enditure a j ,air- that relevant for RSG is that the latter excludes certain items metst entirelv fh0u^ y trom central government funds such as mandatory student awards andbenefit.1 Thepr0vide    Plans for  1983-84  (Cmnd 8494 adjusted to offset reduced NIS liability) ve .  .      911 lncrease of 7.3 per cent in total GB local authority current expenditure r the -*MoraPlans for 1982-83. This is higher than the planned increase of 3.4 per cent invantdef.CUrrent exPenditure. The main reason for the higher rate of increase in the first 11Utlon of current expenditure is that the total for 1983-84 includes for the P^p,. ^ billion for housing benefits formerly provided on central government3gtain ies. ^fiitaiSu&lt;W 6  apital expenditure plans in Cmnd 8494 adjusted to take account of theof the b.
