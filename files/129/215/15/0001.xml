CONFIDENTIALTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(82) AO COPY NO8 December 1982CABINETCIVIL SERVICE NUMBERS AFTER 198A Memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury1. It is time to consider our policy for Civil Service numbers after April 1984.    We are on course to achieve the target of 630,000 by that date.    We need to settle what is to follow in time for our decisions on the 1983 Public Expenditure Survey.2. The annex to this paper considers what form our policy after 1984 should take.3&apos;     The policy adopted in 1980 has been successful.    We shall have removed 102,000 posts (14 per cent)  in our first term of office. For the reasons set out in the annex,  I believe that we should maintain this Policy in our second term, but can improve on the way in which it has worked so far.^&apos;     In brief, I propose that:-a. we should again settle manpower targets for a date several years ahead: I suggest 1 April, 1988;b. the overall target should be constructed on the basis of the targets for each Department (not, as in 1980, the other way round);c. once targets have been established, they should be reviewedas necessary alongside expenditure plans in each successive Survey.We are not yet in a position to settle the target figures. Present Plans, as shown in the 1982 Survey, show some continuing reductions between April 1984 and April 1986.    But we need to improve on these, and o establish the maximum scope for further reductions over the two years ollowing.    I therefore propose the exercise set out in paragraphs 18 to of the annex.    This would include the Civil Service component of the Operation on contracting-out on which the Chancellor of the Exchequer wil be making further proposals.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL .      I invite colleagues to agree that:-a. there should be a review early in 1983 to identify and quantify the scope for reducing Civil Service manpower between 1984 and 1988;b. I should write to Ministers early in January about the detail of the assessments they are asked to make for each of their Departments;c. replies should be sent to me in the first half of March;d. after any bilateral discussions that seem necessary, I should report back to Cabinet in May with proposals for new Civil Service manpower targets up to 1988;e. starting with the 1983 Public Expenditure Survey, manpowerand expenditure plans should then be reviewed in parallel each year.L BTreasury Chambers 8 December 19822CONFIDENTIAL
MANAGEMENT IN CONFIDENCEpolicyON CIVIL SERVICE NUMBERS AFTER APRIL 1984note considers the Government&apos;s policy for civil service numbersafter April 1984. (It does not discuss other public services such as the National Health Service or local government.)2    When the Government came into office, there were 732,000 civil se^ants.   In May 1980 the Prime Minister announced to P^liament a target of about 630,000 by April 1984.   By 1 October 1982 the total 655,000.   Thus, of the planned reduction of 102,000 the achieve-up to October was 77,000. The Government is well on the way to achieving the 1984 target.   Departments are working to individual targets which will produce this result.3.v/e should now consider policy for the future after 1984 and afor pursuing it.   In due course both will need to   e announed ^Ucly.   Ls paper suggests a general decision before the end of ^2.   There is already some public debate.   For example   the OBI h*s suggested that the present rundown should be contmued for a ^ther year to April 1985, which at the present rate would imply a further reduction of some 20,000 to 610,000.4.^he Government has announced its drive to improve civil servicedement, especially financial management (Cmnd 8616).

MANAGEMENT IN CONFIDENCEIfcontrol and restraint of numbers as well as of pay rates, the pressure were relaxed, numbers and costs would certa creep up again.ii.   Experience shows that a tight policy on numbers:- helps to stimulate the critical scrutiny of functions and priorities, and of the scope for curtailing* privatising and contracting out government activi&quot;tie- helps to check the propensity to expand government activities and expenditure;- stimulates and encourages as nothing else does an effective drive for greater efficiency and improved performance.6.   For analogous reasons the trend elsewhere is towards dir^g control of manpower numbers;   the Government is encouraging in the public services, for example in the NHS.   And in prac some forward planning of civil service manpower is necessary anyway:i. Public and Parliamentary interest in the size oi  **service will persist.   It will be necessary to continue ^publish in the Chief Secretary&apos;s memorandum  at the time_ y, forBudget the numbers for the beginning and end of &quot;the ye gtaff&apos; which provision is made in the Estimates, and to publish in-post figures quarterly during the year.ii. It is necessary to take administrative and stan c r in eacttture fully into account, including manpower numbers, successive Public Expenditure Survey.iii. Because of constraints on dismissal and costs oA rsoi^ ancy, and in the interests of rational recruitment and pe ^ management, changes in manpower levels have to be plann advance.Present plans and prospects7.

MANAGEMENT IN CONFIDENCEa continuing but slower rate of decline:   to 623,850 in April 1985, to 621,150 in April 1986.o  In addition, present plans include two major further reductions Defore the end of the decade:9.a. Hiving-off the ROPs (perhaps before 1986), which in theory would reduce civil service numbers by 25,000, in practice by perhaps 18,000-19,000.b. Various measures of computerisation (PAYE in the Inland Revenue, the Operational Strategy in DHSS, computer projects in the Manpower Services Commission and elsewhere). These Projects will require substantial capital investment, not all yet provided for in expenditure programmes.   The staff savingsa^ise mainly after 1986.   They might amount in all to 12,000-15,000 before 1990.   But computer projects are liable to slip-Page, and their staff 3aving3 with them.Some other smaller savings are also planned in the Inland Revenue,and Scottish Office.   These however are more than offset by sPective additions in the Home and Scottish Offices (for prisons) he Inland Revenue (for non-domestic rating revaluation), and inthDepartments of Trade and Industry.   The net effect of the De an increase of around 2,000.se10.Thuson present plans civil service numbers may be expected to  line further to around 605,000 by the end of the decade;    or to 0und 585,000 if credit is taken for the hiving-off of the ROPs.n,*ty*      art from major policy changes, these numbers will be affected ^e^Conoir ic and other developments, notably by changes in unemploy-ih n&apos;   A :fur&quot;bner iarge rise or a fall will affect staffing levels Employment and (to a lesser extent) the Inland Revenue.12.    In addition there can and should be further improvements in ob    lencv    Much has already been done, and some of the mostVious steps already taken.   But the continuing high returns from fo       ies  staff inspections and reviews indicate that the scope Action remains wide, and the current drive to improve management ^crease the use of information technology should produce worth-esults over the next 5 years.    As the White Paper pointed
MANAGEMENT IN CONFIDENCEofout, there is a continuing necessity to review the functionsGovernment, to eliminate those that are unnecessary of no longerequired and to ensure that those that are kept are done asefficiently as possible.   (The Lord Privy Seal has circulatedproposals for centrally co-ordinated exercises in 1983 to talcej_ org asplace alongside Ministers&apos; departmental exercises.) In most  -of work accordingly there should be a presumption that a smaHe number should be needed to carry a given work-load in 1988 than in 1984.Lessons of the 630,000 Operation13.    The 630,000 operation has demonstrated the merits of fixin^a target for several years ahead.    It is certain that large*&quot; ^tions have resulted, and more quickly, than would have beenj ^ithotherwise. The record of the Civil Service, when comparea the National Health Service and local government, providesto alsupport for this view.    Departments, with forward targetsduc-at, have had the opportunity to plan their reductionsThe tar-gets have been tight enough to act as a stimulus to efficland higher productivity, and to oblige departments to examinecritically the need for existing functions, the scope f r -LeSa oDP rlabour-intensive ways of achieving policy objectives ana nitits for privatisation.    All that has been a clear gain.  on  ^14. But there have also been some penalties.    The comD^natl^0ymentambitious targets for each department with fast-rising unewpwhich depleted the contingency margin of 15,000 left little^for manoeuvre, made it difficult to delegate authority topventedmanagers where their staff numbers are concerned, and pre some new initiatives which would have increased staff  ut W have been financially beneficial.i&apos;s not15. It is also clear that downward pressure on numbers j- ^qjienough by itself.    It is necessary to think through the re ducedof functions so as to match a smaller number of staff t0ieW t workload and to keep up the impetus of scrutiny and revie test the need for working procedures and the scope for econ ^ on the ground.    It will also be necessary to invest in  rdeMANAGEMENT IN CONFIDENCE
MANAGEMENT IN CONFIDENCEsave (see paragraph 8 above on computers), provided always that manpower and expenditure planning move consistently together within the Government&apos;s overall economic strategy.16. The aim of numbers policy after 1984 should thus be to maintain the advantages of a target policy, in such a way as to match it more systematically with the curtailing of functions and the improvement of efficiency, and to make it a coherent part of the Government&apos;s wider policy for good management.Proposals for policy after April 198417. A necessary first step is to reach a judgment on the scope for further reductions in the Government&apos;s second term. The figures in the 1982 Survey (paragraph 7 above) reflect the consequences of decisions already taken and extend only to April 1986. They do not provide an adequate basis for setting an aim which is ^ugh but realistic for the lifetime of the next Parliament.18-   It is therefore proposed that the Treasury should conduct a aervice-wide exercise early in 1983 to establish a basis for ^antifymg reductions up to April 1988.   The Chief Secretary would Write to his colleagues early in January asking for written reports early in March which would assess for each of their departments:-(i) Taking the manpower figures to 1 April 1986 shown in the I*ublic Expenditure Survey as the starting point, and takingfull account of the scope for further improvements in efficiency, what would be the lowest practicable limit for civil service staff in post for each year from 1 April 1985 to 1 April 1988 inclusive on the basis of present policies (projected beyond the end of the PES cycle);(ii) What would be the manpower and expenditure implications f any new policies or initiatives which are already envisaged , hut are not yet incorporated into departments&apos; PES programmes;5MANAGEMENT IN CONFIDENCE
MANAGEMENT IN CONFIDENCE(iii) Whether and how they could reduce the figures propos at (i) above by 5% or 10% by a combination of(a) further improvements in efficiency involving a change in policy;(b) further privatisation or contracting-out ( n which the Chancellor will be making proposals)}(c) other new initiatives or policy decisions to reduce civil service tasks and the manpower they require.,1d pay19.    In assessing departments&apos; responses, the Treasury wouj-regard to each department&apos;s past record, its scope for further nt-erestsreductions, and the need for continued pressure in theof improving efficiency and productivity.    In the light oiassessment, the Chief Secretary would report to his colleaguethe end of May 1983 on the prospects for civil service numDerS t insand propose both a target for each department and, by ag these, a target for the Civil Service as a whole.    As before* margin might be added to the latter for contingencies.20. The objective would be to set targets at a level whicr continuing pressure to achieve improvements in efficiency wl enabling departments to plan their future manpower in an ^ way, consistent both with their expenditure planning more  el^and with the development of their plans for improving fi&quot;anC management.21. It would then be both necessary and desirable to p. orgetSfigures.    There would be a strong presumption that the ^a   t0 would be adhered to but the Government would reserve the alter them in either direction and explain why. (-men22.

Ministers would take new decisions relating to expenditure and manpower at the same time, and where these produced Eductions in manpower, targets would be lowered accordingly. Although the targets could not readily be altered upwards, thisc uid also be done if a strong enough case was made out for doing so.3    A policy on these lines should be related to other policies affecting the management of staff whose career prospects have already been radically affected by manpower policy.    It should go to8ether with:-a.    giving staff more satisfying jobs by reducing the number of levels through which work passes and delegating more authority to managers in line with the current initiative on financial management;b     improving incentives to efficiency.    Pilot schemes for incentives to line managers and the consideration of &quot;merit Pay&quot; in the context of the Megaw report are relevant;c     facilitating the easing out of less efficient staff at all levels both for its own sake and to avoid too great a deterioration of promotion prospects;d  identifying the most able staff and planning their career development.nief Secretary&apos;s paper for colleagues (paragraph 19) would he ^ Progress on these matters which the Lord Privy Seal and lntend to consider in the early part of 1983.21.Themanpower policy proposed here would require stringentnistration to ensure that targets were not altered substantially,MANAGEMENT IN CONFIDENCE
