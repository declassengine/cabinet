CONFIDENTIALTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTc(82) 42 COPY NOU December 1982CABINETPARLIAMENTARY CONTROL OF EXPENDITURE  (REFORM) BILL Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;&apos;Mr Norman St John-Stevas&apos;s Private Member&apos;s Bill is down for Second Reading on 28 January.    It is intended to implement the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC)  in their First Special Report of 1980 81 (Other Committees had previously made similar recommendations.     The mam principles of the Bill are that the appointment of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;AG) and his staff should not be in the Government s hands,  and that the range of the audit should be &quot;wherever publicJ ^y goes&quot; - in particular to include the nationalised industries and many public companies.2. In the Government&apos;s Reply (Cmnd 8323) to the Report we accepted the need for new legislation to update the statutory description of the C&amp;AG functions; but were not convinced of the immediate need for the radical changes proposed by the PAC.    Following an adjournment debate on30 November 1981 an Early Day Motion collected nearly 300 signatures in favour of the PAC&apos;s recommendations.    We have since been discussing minor concessions (within existing legislation) with Messrs Barnett and du Cann and others following discussion in E Committee on 9 February lyaz.3. The initiative is, however now with Mr St John-Stevas.    Although he has asked for co-operation in drafting the legislation., he is determined to proceed, with the support of the movers of the Early Day Motion. He is confident that his Bill will command very wide support; and theLord President believes that this confidence is not misplaced     Our White Paper arguments were and are sound, but we cannot now expect that a majority in Parliament will accept them as overriding the_constitutional argument about accountability which dominates their thinking._ I believe, therefore, that we should now concentrate on seeking to negotiate witn Mr St John-Stevas and his associates a specification for the Bill which will be sensible and workable, and minimise the adverse consequences ot moving too far in the direction urged by some of the extremists, and it we can negotiate a specification, we should offer the services of Parliamentary Counsel to help with the drafting, working to agreed instructions.    This will give us a much better chance of influencing the BiH, and ending up with a tolerable piece of legislation, than would be iikely if We wait for the Bill to be presented in the form currently Proposed by Mr St John-Stevas, and then attempt piecemeal amendments against the mood of the House.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALINDEPENDENCE OF THE C&amp;AG AND HIS STAFF4.     The C&amp;AG is at present an office holder under the Crown, appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister who consults the Chairman of the PAC. His staff are civil servants of the Exchequer and Audit Department. Changing the manner of his appointment could involve constitutional considerations, though the adoption of a procedure whereby the recommendation to the Crown came from a Commission, consisting of the Prime Minister and the Speaker, would not in itself be damaging.    What is important is that we should not concede that the C&amp;AG and his staff should become employees of the House.    They would then become liable to directions from the House which could include any of its Committees.    That would raise serious Problems about their access to the Government&apos;s files.5-     I believe we must seek to ensure the independence of the C&amp;AG and his staff both from the Government and from Parliament (other than by Act of Parliament).    The national audit should be conducted as a professional operation with proper audit objectives; it should not be made to react to Particular and transient interests of Members or Parliamentary Committees or the Press.    The C&amp;AG could not, of course,  ignore representations made to him - from Government as well as others - but the decision on what he and his staff should do should be his and his alone.6      On that basis it should be acceptable that he should retain his present Powers of access to papers which have, by consent over many years, allowed  ot only for statutory certification audit but also for value-for-money and effectiveness studies.    C&amp;AG investigations, and PAC examinations, have always scrupulously avoided policy issues: they have been audit-based, le concerned with past, not future, expenditure.    This must remain the case; for on any other basis we could easily find ourselves obliged to impose, and defend, restrictions on access for particular investigations.7- I attach at Annex A an outline of new arrangements for the Appointment and Status of the C&amp;AG which would I believe be satisfactory for G vernment:  it remains to be seen whether they would satisfy the House.ScOPE OF THE AUDIT8- Annex B deals fully with the position of the nationalised industries. The arguments against involving the C&amp;AG there and in such companies as BL&gt; Rolls Royce, etc are sound, but my judgement is that they will not carry the day, against the appeal of the simplistic PAC formula offollowing public money wherever it goes&quot;.    I, therefore, think we must n w concentrate on how far, rather than whether, this should be accepted.Asregards the nationalised industries, I suggest the following:a.     Access to the books of nationalised industries should be through a separate branch of the proposed National Audit Office, to consist of staff with adequate qualifications and experience to understand the commercial scenario in which they operate. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission should be withdrawn except for monopoly inquiries as for the private sector.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALb. Studies in the nationalised industries should follow a systematic programme determined by the C&amp;AG in consultation with the Government and the industries.10. The British Technology Group (BTG) is already in an anomalous position -the Exchequer and Audit Department (E&amp;AD) audits the National Research Development Council side of its activities - and I suggest we should concede access to all its books  (but not the books of companies in which it has an interest) .11. For private sector companies, I should prefer to confine access to those where the Government has a controlling interest (BL, Rolls Royce and Possibly Cable and Wireless).    There will be pressure to extend this to other companies where the Government holds shares, either directly (British Aerospace, Britoil, BP) or through BTG - but these are commercial concerns and we should resist E&amp;AD crawling over their business if possible. There will also be pressure to &quot;follow public money&quot; into other companies which receive substantial assistance in grants,  loans or guarantees, eg the  200 million guarantee to ICL.    Again we should resist this impossible -but at worst I should want to try to find some way of distinguishing these cases of substantial selective assistance from the ordinary run of small-scale or automatic grants (Regional Development Grants, agriculture, and so  n).    This negotiating position is summarised in Annex C, and the fall-back Position is set out at Annex D.OTHER MATTERS12     Other issues on which I believe we should seek to agree with Mr St John-Stevas and his backers are also listed in Annex C.CONCLUSION13-    A lot of this is very disagreeable; and it will,  in particular, be difficult to ensure that the change in respect of the nationalised industries is conducive to more efficient management.    But I am convinced that if we do not go as far as is proposed in Annexes A and C we shall be in a poor tactical position, and we may well need to move to the position described in Annex D.    We need to influence the initial drafting of the BiH.    If it were to be tabled in a form which reflects only the PAC&apos;s Proposals, we would,  in moving amendments in Committee, appear to be trying to avoid full accountability to Parliament.I, therefore, seek:1. approval to negotiate with the backers of the Bill on the lines of Annexes A and C;2. discretion to move,  if necessary,  to the position described at Annex D; and3. agreement that,  if a deal can be struck, drafting assistance to, and support for, the Bill may be offered.GHTreasury Chambers ^ December 19823CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIALANNEX B^^JlUsed Industries 1. wWB have hitherto resisted giving the C&amp;AG and his staff access0 the nationalised industries on a number of grounds.      First, C&amp;AGq c t i1ty would tend to inhibit the industries from acting commerciallyle   them to adopt defensive attitudes.      Second,  the Government8lslated in the 1980 Competition Act to enable the MMC to conduct fficiP .ncY investigations and they provide a more effective instrument. We have over the past year taken steps to increase the numberf mmc^ references and to improve the follow-up to their reports.and more generally,  we were concerned that the line of responsi-y tor the industries should continue to run through Ministers to roent and that the scope of C&amp;AG activity should not therefore , that for which Ministers could be held responsible. Otherwisej ations between Parliament,  Ministers and Departments,  and theUstries couid be seriously affected.a      ^ese arguments were,  and remain valid.      We have already offered er  &quot;f concessions  in order broadly to maintain existing arrange-^Pe &quot;      ^6 ^ave encouraged the C&amp;AG to use his access to departmental Hq^. S ^  examine how Departments    exercise their responsibilities for1 na ised industries.      We have agreed to encourage the PAC tobee       lnv lved in the follow-up to MMC reports.      And we would havePrepared  [as a final concession) to consult the PAC on the eiecfalQn of references.3&apos; InSt q       CDnsidering what move we should now make in response to thethg   n ^evas Bill, we should keep our underlying objectives towardsinv       Ustries firmly in view.      We want a mechanism for conducting9hSeri^       10ns into the industries particularly where competition isqncj        r Weak.      We want to avoid being drawn into day-to-day issuesWQr|^    ereDy undermine the responsibilities of the management.

CONFIDENTIAL5 Promoters which would at the same time offer the best chanceThe Key question is what moves we can make to satisfy theOfrneeting our objectives.      We have considered whether it would be POSsihle to make a  limited concession with the aim of preserving the ent M(v|q system on broadly unchanged lines - for example by means understanding that the C&amp;AG&apos;s powers would be used infrequently 0_p   n y when he had some prima facie reason to think there was misuse ^it U ^C ^Uncis&apos;      ^r Possibly by associating the C&amp;AG more closelythe industries&apos;  existing external auditors. But it seems quite  &apos; ear fk a., .       LRat the C&amp;AG and the PAC would not accept restrictions of this.          J-nqeed it is the C&amp;AG&apos;s intention to have a permanent presenceh      ^ or roost of the industries and to use their work as a means of CidinP knQ^       &lt;= when to make a fuller enquiry.      Options of this kind areerefore worth pursuing.      They are likely at the end of the dayTlgg nbe Parallel  systems of enquiry by the C&amp;AG and MMC.      This wouldm st undesirable outcome.s. The 0r|ly realistic option is to accept the principle of C&amp;AG ess to fUon tne industries and to seek to build an effective systemhat hwe asis.      9y making this important concession of principleshoL|]ri uthr  able to maximise the influence we can bring to bear onshanp nnAs &apos;   a new system and to see this reflected in the Bill.the   C rQllary    in order to avoid duplication,  the use of the MMC for(a]f   rP se of efficiency investigations in the industries would cease h uph ifWoui z w uld continue to look into monopoly questions).

There should be no difficulty in is n ,       nis with the C&amp;AG,  although in practice the dividing line always clear cut,6&apos;     The m^e nn        ain risk under this option - and it is a real one -  is of C&amp;AG&apos;S anuncn^ dPProach and methods  inducing in the industries an.     mrT1ercia] &apos;M*s jj, an  defensive attitude.

Ur aimj.       m ^ust be to shift his approach into a more commercial direction.ea^y one would want to see the nationalised industry investigations ^        a out by a wholly separate command under the C&amp;AG, using Cq a^ernent consultants to provide cross-fertilisation with besterciai practice as well as staff directly employed by him. 8^     r 1t will  be difficult to embody this in legislation; and ugh we would try to reach an understanding with the C&amp;AG,   he may Unwil1ing to go as far in this direction as we would like.^   &quot;^ere are two other major questions which this option raises:Uencing the C&amp;AG&apos;s programme of enquiries;    and following up the Ss^ts.8,n the first Question,   it  is important that the Government ntin.        ues to have a major influence on the programme of investigations, wi ]_ iScr        Want to ensure that all industries are periodically^^n^sed.      And we will no doubt want particular industries j.^     ned from time to time in response to events.
