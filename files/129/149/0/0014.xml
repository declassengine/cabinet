DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT63C(70) 54 COPY NO28 April 1970CABINETSITUATION IN THE SHIPBUILDING industry memorandum by the Paymaster general in view of the current public interest in the shipbuilding industry,my colleagues will v/ish to have my assessment of the present position.background.        Following the report of the Geddes Committee published in&apos;March 1966, the Shipbuilding Industry Act was passed in June 1967,    Thisset up the Shipbuilding Industry Board (SIB) which under the Act asamended was authorised to makei. grants of up to  20 millionii. loans (or equity investments) of up to  32f million the Minister was also authorised, subject to SIB recommendation, to guarantee bank loans for United Kingdom ship orders placed with united Kingdom yards up to a total of  400 million.    Anneir A shows theexpenditure and commitments of SIB grants and loans.3,        During 1966-67 the world new orders rose from 18 to 22 million gross tons as compared with an average of 10 million gross tons in the first half of the 1960s, but the British industry was being priced out of themarket and obtained only a small proportion of new world orders -2.2 per cent in 1966 and 5 per cent In 1967.    Orders in 1967 includedhowever five giant tankers and two container ships, the earliest of whichwill not be delivered until later this year.4.        In 1968-69 the industry was able to build up its order book and obtained, in tonnage terms, 9.8 per cent of new world orders in 1968 and7 per cent in 1969.     The British order book at the end of 1969 amounted to 600 million of merchant ships and  200 million of home and overseasorders for naval vessels.1
5. Because, even when order books are low, a vessel is not usually-completed and delivered for two years, the output amounted to onlyone million gross tons in 1968 and 0. 8 million gross tons in 1969.    output is expected to rise to 1, 5 million gross tons in 1970 and higher still in 1971,reflecting the influx of orders in 1968-69.PRESENT FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES6.        The poor financial results now appearing from the shipbuildingcompanies is mainly attributable to the following factors;i. Productivity has grown less quickly than hoped,ii. Ships are built on fixed price contracts and the industry has there fore been placed in great difficulty by the considerable increases in wages and the cost of materials and components for which it oftencannot obtain fixed prices at the time tenders for ships are taken.iii. It is now the usual accounting practice to make provision for any future losses expected on existing contracts.INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES7*        Annex B summarises the order book, employment and turnoverof the main shipbuilding companies,8,        Annex C shows the latest estimate of the financial position of these companies in three categories?-a. Those which are in known difficulty and clearly have no reserves to meet the problem.b. Two small builders who have specialised and are earning goodprofits.c. Companies caught with long order books and some losses in prospect and whose ability to ride out the problem is not certain.POSITION ABROAD9.        Long order books and rising costs have produced similar difficultiesabroad, and one of the two major Dutch companies (Verolme) has had to berescued by the Netherlands Government,    In some countries the impact is less because the &quot;home market&quot; is reserved to the national shipbuilding industry.   For example, the Japanese have a home shipbuilding programmeof 2-3 million gross tons a year and support this construction programme in their own yards by credit on terms more favourable than theinternationally agreed minimum export credit rate for ships.    TheEuropean Economic Community (e.c.) allows shipbuilding subsidies of up2
to 10 per cent; Italy gives more, while France not only subsidises at the agreed e.c. rate but also operates a scheme by which shipbuilders are able to insure against the effect of cost escalation.    A large number ofother countries restrict ship purchases abroad and give large subsidies(for example USA, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Greece and Spain,as well as many Communist countries).    Sweden has supported hershipbuilding industry by way of limited credits, and the fact that her mainyards have been constructed or re-equipped in recent years to specialisein tankers and large bulk carriers has put them in a relatively favourable position, although profits have been very low.PROSPECTS10.       It is possible that the present series of bad financial statementsrepresent the bottom cf a trough, although confidence could be furthersapped when the poor Swan Hunter results are published shortly-.Favourable factors include the benefits of specialisation and re-equipmentgradually appearing, the working through of older orders which madeinsufficient provision for receixt cost increases; and the possible profits on other orders which have yet to be brought in to the accounts.    But these factors could be offset if there are further increases in labour or other costs, if productivity fails to improve or if the redundancies necessary incertain areas (e.g. Upper Clyde and Birkenhead) are not carried throughquickly.SHIP REPAIRING INDUSTRY11.        Ship repairing was not covered by the Geddes Report or the shipbuilding Industry Act.    There has been a general world decline in demand for ship repairing and the United Kingdom, partly for geographicalreasons, is not well placed to maintain its share of the market.    (Theannouncement last week that the Palmers yard at He bourn, owned byVickers, would close is attributable to this general problem).    Repairyards are often under separate ownership and even when dwned byshipbuilders are usually separately managed.    They have traditionallybeen casual employers in the port areas, but the position is changing.To avoid giving  all-back pay when there is no work, some repairers are said to be taking business at below cost.    The Shipbuilding and ShipRepairing Council, consisting of the SIB and representatives of management and unions in these industries, is at present considering the problems and prospects of ship repairing.ACTION BEING TAKEN12.       The Shipbuilding Industry Bill which is to have its Second reading on 30 April, will raise the limit on guarantees for the financing ofUnited Kingdom orders to  600 million,,    Because the SIB are statutorilyconcerned with the administration of the guarantee scheme, and because itwould be awkward at this time to announce its dissolution at the end of 1970,the Minister of Technology proposes to use his powers under the shipbuilding industry Act, 1957, to prolong the SIB*s life by one year.3
13.       My colleagues will already be aware of the special problems ofUpper Clyde Shipbuilders and Cammell Laird.    For the rest, lamdiscussing with the SIB how the remaining funds available to them under the shipbuilding Industry Act can best be used to secure both the immediate and longer term improvement of the industry^ position with particular attention to Swan Hunter and Harland and Wolff,    I shall of course keep mycolleagues informed of the outcome,14.       Meanwhile for the longer term, the Ministry of Technology will,in the light of the present discussions in the Organisation for economic co-operation and Development Shipbuilding Working Party about bothcredit and other forms of Government assistance to shipbuilding, study the implications of the current developments in the industry for future government policy when the SIB comes to the end of its statutory life.h lMinistry of Technology SW128 April 19704

Prom the  5.h m.remaining Cammell Laird, Harland &amp; Wolff and Swan Hunter, have all approached the SIBseeking substantial financial support.    There is also the possibility of applications from other firms in the shipbuilding and engine building industries.Loans    (Section k) and Share Subscription (Section 6)    -    million total available Already Paid Firmly Committed BalanceAgainst this balance, we are currently considering proposals by the SIB to lendup to  2.3 m. to Scott Lithgow.   UCS hope to obtain a further  1 m. for capital equipmentbut it is unlikely that this loan will be made until they have demonstrated that theyare on the road to viability.    The balance should be more than adequate to meet anyforeseeable proposals for loan assistance by the SIB during the remainder of their life.Ministry of Technology,S.W.1.28th   April, 197032.516.055(including  3 m. sharesubscription s UCS)0.145015.995
