ANNUAL REVIEW AND DETERMINATION of guarantees 1970Introduction1. The Annual Review has in many quarters come to be regarded almost asthe settlement of a pay claim. This is not its purpose. Under the agriculture act 1947, it is the Governments task to review each year with the farmers&apos;representatives the condition and prospects of the industry. In the light oftheir conclusions from this Review they have then to decide the action required(i) to promote and maintain a stable and efficient agricultural industry which can(ii) produce such part of the nation&apos;s food as it is in the national interestto grow at home, and(iii) do so at minimum prices consistent with proper remuneration and anadequate return on capital to those engaged in the industry.The Job of Agriculture- 2. The job of agriculture was announced in 1968 in the Governmentsselective expansion programme. This programme was framed in the knowledge that the industry had achieved rising output and major gains in productivity.Although these were secured with the backing of subsidies from public funds(running in total at some  270 million per year) the industry was neverthelessmeeting part of their higher costs, through their own efficiency gain. In thisway, the industry had helped considerably in keeping down the real cost of thesubsidy bill. It was on the basis that this process would continue that theGovernment announced the extension of the selective expansion programme to 1972/73.3. Selective expansion is still wanted. It is needed not only to save imports nowbut if we go into the E.E.C. to reduce the bill which would have to be paid throughadoption of the common agricultural policy. The aim is for agriculture toproduce more of the right commodities to meet rising demand on an economic basis.   The priority products are still beef, pigmeat, wheat and barley.4. This programme relates to that part of the nation&apos;s food supply whichit is in the nation&apos;s interest to produce at home. It is a most important part but only a part of our growing requirements. Rather less than half of what we need valued at nearly  1,900 million and including many items whichcannot be produced here at all still has to be imported. The terms andconditions on which it is imported are important to us as a major tradingc5
nation. The resources we use to produce food at home or to import it fromabroad have to be carefully weighed. The nation&apos;s food must be grown,bought and distributed efficiently. A quarter of consumers&apos; spending is on food. It is the Governmenfs policy to keep food prices as low as is reasonablypossible. The provision of conditions to enable these things to be done isthe job of the Ministers responsible for food and agriculture. It means strikinga proper balance between the different interests farmers and importers,processors and distributors, taxpayers and consumers.The Condition of the IndHstry5. In 1968/69 the industry had a bad time. The foot-and-mouth epidemicin the winter of 1967/68 took a heavy toll of livestock. The 1968 harvest waspoor. The wet autumn made cultivation and the sowing of winter wheat verydifficult. The spring of 1969 was no better. There were heavy lamb losses.Sowing was delayed and in some areas impossible. The grass flush was lateand increased dairying costs.6. So production fell; productivity dropped; and actual net income declinedby  36 million to  480J million in 1968/69.7. But in 1969/70 there has been a good recovery. Production is back atthe record level of 1967/68. Productivity is again increasing. Net income isrising and is forecast at  535^ million in 1969/70, an increase of  55 million on the year before. It is now above the 1967/68 level. The forward trend hasbeen resumed.8. But the bad eighteen months have left their mark. The industry has lost the increase in income it should have had in 1968/69 and its capacity to investfor expansion has been impaired as a result. Tight credit and the high cost of borrowing have limited the scope for making this good.9. For this reason the Government believe that this year special steps arenecessary to enable the industry to do its job.The Needs of the Agricultural Industry10. This is the background against which the Government have had to assesswhat resources are needed by the agricultural industry to do its job and whatreturn the nation would get on the investment of those resources.11. In the Governmenfs view, there is need to replenish the industry&apos;s re-sources, to contain costs, to increase investment for expansion and to providereasonable stability of markets.12. These are the needs which the Government have set out to meet. Theydo not believe they can be secured by any one means. Nor do they believe thatthey can be sensibly provided by the conventional Annual Review method of adjusting guaranteed prices and production grants. They have therefore decided to introduce a series of measures specifically designed to meet theseneeds. These measures are summarised in the following paragraphs and explained in more detail in Annex B.
The Measures Proposed13. First, the need to replenish the industry&apos;s resources. Many prices particularly for the arable crops take time to flow back to farmers in the formof cash. Increased resources can be made available more readily by reducingthe cost of inputs. The best tool immediately available to do this is the subsidy on fertilisers and lime.   Both of these are widely used.14. The Government have therefore decided to raise the rates of subsidy forone year from 19th March 1970 with the object of increasing cash resourcesby something like  10 million  9 million for fertilisers and  1 million on lime.The actual amount will depend on the uptake. But the use of fertilisers hasbeen rising over the years. The increased subsidies will put money into the farmers&apos; pockets by reducing costs which they would otherwise have had tomeet. This will also be an incentive to greater productivity. It will helpcereal growers, potato growers and sugar beet growers. It will help horticulture-culturists too. It will provide money for livestock producers and particularly for dairy farmers and help them to improve the productivity of grassland.15. It is important that this help should remain with the farmers. Theprincipal fertiliser manufacturers have informed the Government of the impor-tance which they attach to providing the conditions under which the agricultural industry can make its full contribution to the economy of the nation. They have therefore given an assurance that they will not raise their current list prices tocustomers during the coming twelve months. Should the fertiliser manufac-turers consider during the course of the coming year that such exceptional circumstances had arisen that it was essential for them to reconsider their position, they would consult with the representatives of the agricultural industryand with the Government.16. Second, the need to contain and offset costs. They have been heavy this last year some  60 million extra since the 1969 Review, of which a substantial part is due to increased prices of feedingstuffs and machinery. But the industryin reaching its better net income position this year has already incurred a large part of these additional costs. Of course, some cost increases must be expected in the coming year. Nobody yet knows the extent of these. But the Govern-ment have decided that for the main priority commodities beef, pigmeat,wheat and barley the prices will be increased and the cost increases fallingin the current year more than offset. They will do the same for milk and sheep, because of the importance they attach to restoring breeding numbers, andalso for potatoes, because of the need to ensure that home production continuesto meet demand in full. On these seven commodities some  54 million will beinjected. This will fully cover the extra costs falling on these commodities;provide money over and above; and enable the producers to retain the benefitof rising productivity and extra production.17. The prices of the other arable crops will remain unchanged. But the producers of these commodities will all benefit through the higher fertiliser andlime subsidies.18. On eggs the Government policy has been announced. It is alreadyknown that the subsidy will be phased out by 1974.   It will also be put on a flat
rate basis. The necessary further steps to do this are being taken and there willbe a cut of lid. a dozen in the price of eggs. But minimum import prices have been negotiated with overseas suppliers. These will prevent the marketfrom being undermined by low priced imports. They will come into operation on 31st March 1970, and will be kept under review.19. Minimum import prices for eggs and egg products are one of the measuresto meet the need for stability of the market. Market prices are important to farmers. Reasonable returns from the market engender confidence and can help income. Wide fluctuations do not benefit anyone producer, overseassupplier, importer, or consumer.20. Over the past few years the Government have introduced many measuresto help provide market stability. Minimum import prices for cereals have beenin operation since 1964. As a result of the Kennedy Round in 1967 these were continued without a corresponding obligation to hold down home produc-tion. The arrangements have been strengthened further in the last year.The Bacon Market Sharing Understanding, which was revised last year, nowgives home producers the opportunity to win a larger share of the market.This opportunity is being taken. Imports of butter are subject to quota.Cheese is subject to voluntary restraint on imports coming into our market,and arrangements for regulation will be continued. Butter and cheese importshave both been reduced over the last year or so. More recently the Govern-ment have agreed to participate in a multilateral arrangement for minimumexport prices for skim milk powder if other countries agree. All these arrange-ments will provide greater stability on the milk products market here which itis desirable to continue and where appropriate improve. The arrangementsfor voluntary restraint on imports of broilers have been continued. Lastly,discussions are proceeding to provide for more orderly marketing and price stability for beef.21. Taken together these various measures cover most of the more importantproducts. They provide a firm base for the stable markets which the Govern-ment recognise the industry needs.22. The Government will also be introducing this year a new scheme to helpstep up the eradication of brucellosis. This is the third of the major measuresdecided upon in the light of this year&apos;s Review. Producers who make theirdairy herds or beef herds brucellosis-free will receive a premium of lid. per gallon on milk or an extra 37s. 6d. on the beef cow or hill cow subsidies. Thiswill give a special incentive to producers whose herds have few reactors tosend them for slaughter and to become accredited. They will then avoid thehigh cost of disease as well as improve their incomes from these premiums.23. Northern Ireland, which is already nearly brucellosis-free, will benefitsubstantially and at once from this scheme. In the rest of the country the impact will be slower. But as the number of accredited herds increases, thebenefit of the incentives will be felt by more and more dairy and beef producers.The speed at which this happens will depend upon the response. It is estimatedthat in the first full year the money going into the industry will amount to some 5 million.  It will increase each year as more herds become accredited.24. Finally, the need for further incentives to invest in expansion. Underthe various agricultural capital grant schemes there are already substantial
grants for investment in farm buildings; fixed machinery; land drainage; hillland improvements; and remodelling works for farm amalgamations. Therates of grant under these schemes vary. They will all be raised imme-diately by 10 per cent except for the investment grants for buildings andfixed equipment which will be increased from 10 per cent to 30 per cent. It had previously been intended to unify by the end of the year the capital grantsinto one comprehensive scheme, with a basic rate of 30 per cent and a higher rate of 50 per cent for land drainage (60 per cent in the hills) and for hill landimprovements. When this comprehensive scheme is introduced the extra10 per cent will continue to be added to the rates of grant until 18th March1972, when they will return to the levels previously proposed. In practice this means, for instance, that during the next two years a farmer who carriesout a drainage scheme in the hills will be able to get a 70 per cent grant, and on other improvements under the hill land scheme a 60 per cent grant. more generally, all farmers will get 60 per cent grant on land drainage and 40 percent on buildings and machinery.25. These new incentives will be a substantial aid to investment. Theadditional help for buildings for pigs and poultry will be a considerable incentive to specialist producers to expand. More land drainage will improve yields and increase productivity. It will also help to preserve soil structure. The highergrants for hill land improvements will help hill sheep and hill cow producers.Finally, the specialist dairy producer will be given extra resources to expandand get more benefit from greater economies of scale.26. Investment under the capital grant schemes has kept up well until the last few months. This new measure should keep investment moving ahead. Thebenefit to the industry will depend on the rate of uptake. But even if applica-tions do not significantly increase, the additional grants should supply  20million or more to the industry during the coining two years.Summary of Measures27. The Government believe that these measures will meet the present needsof the industry. They will provide the conditions to enable it to maintain and improve the momentum of selective expansion. The additions to the fertiliserand lime subsidies; the improvement of guaranteed prices; and the premiumsfor brucellosis-free herds will all put additional cash into the farmers&apos; pockets.This will give farmers further resources for expansion. It will enable them totake full advantage of the improvements in the capital grant schemes. All this can expand production and raise productivity. This in turn can generate morefarm income.28. Of course, these four interrelated measures cannot sensibly be evaluatedinto a single sum of money as has normally been done at past Annual Reviews.Their real value to the industry lies in the opportunities they provide. taken together, they more than compensate farmers for their additional costs, and leave them this year with the whole benefit of the gain from increased efficiency.These are exceptional measures in order to take account of the effects stemmingfrom the bad 1968/69 season. In all they provide the opportunity to securevery substantial additional resources over the next two years.
29. The cost of these measures falls to be met in part from public expenditure and in part out of consumers&apos; expenditure. What the actual expenditure on agricultural support turns out to be depends upon a number of varying factors,as has been explained in pages 39 and 40 of Cmnd. 4234, but on the basis of theestimates previously drawn up for presentation to Parliament there would haveto be further additions estimated at some  38 million for 1970/71, while thefull-year addition would be higher.Remuneration of the Industry30. The Government believe that these measures can promote and maintain a stable and efficient agricultural industry. They believe that they provide theconditions under which the industry can expand and produce what should,in the national interest, be grown here at home. But what about the remuneration for the industry ?31. The Farmers&apos; Unions have put forward their own view of whatwould be a reasonable level of remuneration. It is natural for the industryto set their sights on a desirable level of income. They have assessed this at 650 million a year net.32. There is no direct relationship between the determinations of theGovernment following an Annual Review and the net income of the whole industry. Many sections of the industry, for example horticulture and poultry,are not covered by Annual Review determinations. Although government measures are obviously important in affecting the net income of many farmers,other things, such as market prices, increasing technological and managerialskills, economies of scale and the trend of production, also have an important influence. A substantial uplift of the industry&apos;s net income must obviouslytake time to generate.33. The remuneration for those working in the industry whether farmers orfarm workers must depend in large measure, as the industry has alwaysrecognised, on rising productivity and the selective expansion of production,both of which have an important effect in generating net income. The Govern-ment believe that the measures that they are introducing will provide theconditions under which the industry can make a substantial move forwardtowards the objective of higher remuneration. It is up to the industry to helpitself by taking advantage of these measures and in so doing help the nation.
ANNEX AGENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITION OF THE AGRICULTURALINDUSTRY1. This annex sets out the latest information on the most important aspectsof the economic condition and prospects of the industry which have been examined at this Review.The course of production2. In 1968/69 production fell sharply as a result of the foot-and-mouthepidemic and the poor cereals harvest. In 1969/70 production of mostcommodities is expected to go up but this will be partly offset by some increasein inputs. The index of net output is expected to rise by 5 per cent from 101in 1968/69 to 106 in 1969/70, the same as the previous highest level in 1967/68(average of 1964/65-1966/67 - 100: Appendix I, Table K, page 35).3. Progress for each main commodity in 1969/70 as compared with 1968/69can be briefly summarised as follows. More home-fed beef is expected thisyear. The beef breeding herd is expanding well and a high proportion of calvesfrom the dairy herd are being retained for beef. Milk production is stillincreasing but expansion in the dairy herd has levelled off. The expansionof the total cattle breeding herd is therefore slowing down. Home productionof mutton and lamb in 1969/70 is expected to be less than in 1968/69 and the sheep breeding flock has continued to decline, partly because of heavy losses in some districts during severe weather at lambing time in 1969. Productionof both pork and bacon is expected to show an increase though expansion ofthe breeding herd has slowed down. Production of both poultry meat and eggshas again risen to new record levels.4. Because of bad weather at sowing time, the cereals acreage in 1969 was lessthan in 1968 but on average yields were much better. So total production in1969 was well up on 1968. Weather also restricted plantings of potatoes in1969 and the main crop may be a little short of demand. With a lower averageyield of beet, home production of sugar is also expected to be rather less thanin 1968/69.   Horticultural production has increased considerably.Labour productivity, efficiency and costs5. Up to 1967/68, labour productivity (the volume of net output per man-year) was increasing at an average annual rate of between 6 and 7 per cent.There was a small decrease in 1968/69, due mainly to the exceptionally heavyfall in output. The upward trend was resumed in 1969/70, with an increaseof about 7 per cent. Over the period 1963/64 to 1969/70 as a whole the average annual rate of increase is put at 5-6 per cent. The total labour supply(including farmers&apos; labour) is estimated to have been falling by about 3 per centannually over this period. However, the number of regular whole-time workers(the largest element) dropped by 6-7 per cent annually from 1964 to 1966 andhas been going down by about 5 per cent annually since 1967. The annualgain in the efficiency of the industry is conventionally assessed as  30 million for guaranteed commodities, taking one year with another.
6. There has been a large net increase in the cost of goods and services usedin agriculture (Appendix III, page 40). Of the total increase a third is due to higher labour costs and another third to higher prices of feedingstuffs and machinery. A substantial proportion of the increase in the cost of feedingstuffsrelates to the abolition of the feed price formula for egg production. under arrangements agreed with the Farmers&apos; Unions, it is necessary this year todeduct from the total figure for cost increases the consolidated payment whichis to be made to the Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry Industry TrainingBoard in lieu of the training levies formerly paid by agricultural and horticultural producers in Great Britain. Allowing for this, the net increasein costs to be taken into account at the Review is some  60 million. similar arrangements are being made for training in Northern Ireland and their cost will be taken into account at the 1971 Annual Review.Income7. In 1969/70 income recovered strongly from the low level to which the bad weather had depressed it in 1968/69. Actual aggregate net income had fallenfrom  51,6-1 million in 1967/68 to  4801 million in 1968/69. It is forecast torise to  535J million in 1969/70. The number of full-time farms, estimated at about 190,000 in June 1969, is declining by about 2 per cent annually so that,per farm, the increase would be rather greater. When the figures for net income in 1968/69 and 1969/70 are adjusted on to a normal weather basis,however, there is little change between the two years (Appendix II, Table A,page 36).8. The latest information on incomes for different types of farming and regions is for 1968/69. This was a poor farming year in England, a better one in Wales and Scotland and a good one in Northern Ireland. In England andWales average net income for all types of farming taken together fell by about16 per cent between 1967/68 and 1968/69, but on cropping farms the averagefall was over 30 per cent. On smaller farms the average fall in income wasrelatively less than on large farms because of the greater incidence of cropping onlarge farms and because costs increased less on smaller farms. Wales didbetter than any of the English regions, showing a marginal increase in averageincome overall. In Scotland average incomes were unchanged overall butthere were considerable variations between different types, with upland farmsdoing well and cropping farms badly: one effect of this was to narrow the range of average incomes on different types of farm. In Northern Ireland, which hadan exceptionally good year, income rose by 17 per cent overall, indicating a recovery from the low levels to which they had fallen in the mid 1960s, althoughthe whole of the increase was represented by higher stock valuations rather than as cash incomes. Dairy farms showed the highest increase in NorthernIreland.9. Specimen figures of the changes in net incomes between 1967/68 and1968/69 are given in Appendix IV (page 41). Detailed figures for England andWales are presented in this year&apos;s report on the Farm Management Survey*which comes out at the same time as this White Paper. Similar information forScotland and Northern Ireland will be published later.* &quot;Farm Incomes in England and Wales, 1968&quot;, H.M.S.O., Price 16s. 6d. (82 p)
Investment10. Total capital formation in agriculture is provisionally estimated at 283 million in 1969, an increase of 10 per cent on 1968. Some  186 million was invested in tenant-type assets comprising new plant, machinery and vehicles and stocks (mainly growing crops and cultivations and livestock). Much of thisis financed by the depreciation provisions charged in the calculation of net income. Total spending on plant, machinery and vehicles at  117 millionfell below the record level of 1968, reflecting in part the tight credit situationand in part the fall in net income in 1968/69. This reduction was however morethan offset by the increase in stock valuation changes. Of the total  283 million,some  97 million was invested in buildings and works in 1969. This was anincrease of 13 per cent over 1968. But most building investment is plannedup to a year or so ahead, and the latest information available suggests a down-turn. About a third of this expenditure was met out of the capital grants butthe largest available source of finance was landlords&apos; net rents (half of whichrepresent imputed rents for owner-occupied farms). These net rents form partof the  145 million for gross rents charged in the calculation of net farm income.Cost of agricultural support11. The cost to the Exchequer in 1969/70 is expected to be about  280 million.This is about  14 million more than in 1968/69. It is less than the estimate for1969/70 as adjusted for the effects of the 1969 Review. Strong market prices have reduced the deficiency payments on fat cattle, sheep and pigs: less willalso be paid on wheat. The estimate for 1970/71 made before this Reviewshows an increase to  299 million, the main increase being for cereals(Appendix V, Table A, page 43).b13
ANNEX BDETAILS OF THE DETERMINATIONS1. Details of the changes in the guarantees are set out in the following paragraphs.  They are: the guaranteed price for fat cattle will go up by 7s. 6d. to 222s. 6d.per cwt.; the hill cow subsidy will be raised by  1 10s. and the beef cow subsidyby  1 per head;-the guaranteed price for fat pigs will go up by Is. Od. to 50s. lid. perscore; the guaranteed price for wheat will go up by Is. 3d. to 30s. 3d. per cwt.; the guaranteed price for barley will go up by Is. Od. to 27s. Od. per cwt.; the guaranteed price for milk will go up by T74d. to 3s. lid. per gallonand the standard quantity will be increased by 24 million gallons(together equivalent to an increase of 2d. in all); the guaranteed price for fat sheep will go up by 3d. to 3s. lOf d. per lb.; the guaranteed price for potatoes will go up by 15s. Od. to 317s. 6d.per ton; the guaranteed price for hen eggs will be reduced by T43d. to 3s. 4-64d.per dozen and the subsidy will be put on a fiat rate basis; the guaranteed price for duck eggs will be reduced by 2-31d. to 2s. 2-76d.per dozen and the subsidy will be put on a flat rate basis; and the Small Farm (Business Management) Scheme will not be renewed.Beef and Milk2. Between June 1968 and June 1969 the beef herd expanded by some 5 percent a much bigger increase than that recorded in the previous year. further expansion is expected by June 1970. These increases reflect the encouragementgiven to beef production at recent Reviews and the higher market prices of thelast two years.3. The dairy herd increased by l  per cent between June 1968 and June 1969.About half of this increase took place in the West Midlands where foot-and-mouth losses were still being made good. Numbers of heifers in calf have declined from the peak levels of 1967/68 and some increase in culling is expectedso that a slight decrease in the dairy herd is likely in the year to June 1970.4. Home-fed supplies of beef and veal in 1969/70 (July/June year) are expectedto be about 3 per cent higher than in 1968/69, while imports are expected to fallby about 1 per cent. Total supplies of beef and veal in 1969/70 are expected tobe about li per cent higher than in 1968/69. As a result of expansion in thebreeding herd and the marked reduction in the number of calves slaughteredover the last two years there are now more store cattle and calves to sustain thefurther expansion of home-fed beef production.5. Beef is one of the priority commodities under the selective expansion programme. The Government want more beef from both the beef and the dairy herds and they look for more efficient use of grassland and the retention of
all suitable calves from the dairy herd. Attainment of these objectives dependsvery largely upon expansion in the beef herd which is going ahead well; uponexpansion in the dairy herd which has recently been checked; and upon thelevel of calf retentions which is at present encouraging. Because of the relatively long production cycle it is particularly important to keep expansionmoving ahead early in the programme. A faster increase in the total breedingherd is needed. The Government wish to ensure that the industry has theresources necessary to continue the expansion of home beef production from both the pure beef and the dairy herds. So the guaranteed price for fat cattlewill be raised by 7s. 6d. to 222s. 6d. per cwt. This will help all farmers whoproduce or fatten animals from either the beef or the dairy herd. In addition,as a more direct incentive to maintaining the strong upward trend in the sucklerherd, the hill cow subsidy will be increased by  1 10s. and the beef cow subsidyby  1 for each eligible animal.6. As foreshadowed in last year&apos;s White Paper (Cmnd. 3965, paragraph 13)discussions are in progress with the interests concerned on the possibility ofsecuring greater stability in the United Kingdom beef market in the longer termby means of a minimum import price system enforced by variable levies underthe Agriculture and Horticulture Act 1964. Stabilisation of the market in thisway would entail similar financial disciplines on home supplies in the interestsof maintaining target price levels. In these circumstances it would be theGovernment^ intention, when making Orders providing for levies on imports,also to modify the guarantee arrangements for fat cattle so as to relate theamount of deficiency payments to the attainment of target indicator prices.(See Appendix VI, Part II, paragraph 5.)7. Average milk yields so far in 1969/70 have recovered from their depressedlevels in 1968/69. The higher yields and an increase in the average size of the dairy herd should together lead to an increase in total output of some 95 million gallons.8. Sales of milk on the liquid market have resumed their upward trend and asmall increase is expected for 1969/70. The standard quantity is adjustedautomatically for the change in liquid consumption. There will be an increase this year of 24 million gallons, equivalent to an increase of 0&quot;27d. per gallonin the guaranteed price.9. The Government have given an assurance that when determining the guaranteed price on milk they would take into account the dilution of theaverage price received by producers as a result of expansion in the dairy herdto get more beef. The increase in the average size of the dairy herd between1968 and 1969 has resulted in a dilution equivalent to 0-46d. on the guaranteed price. The Government have taken account both of this dilution and of theneed to give some further encouragement to the expansion of the dairy herdin order to ensure a continuing and increasing supply of calves suitable for beefbut without too great a stimulus to milk production as such. The guaranteed price for milk will go up by l-74d. to 3s. lid. per gallon. This should makemilk production rather more profitable. Together with the automatic increasein the standard quantity it is equivalent to an increase of 2d. per gallon in theguarantee.10. Current issues of milk and milk products policy were the subject of extensive consultations with the Unions and the Milk Marketing Boards in
the latter half of 1969. These discussions centred in large part on the operationof the guarantee system and the question of greater regulation of the milk products market. Action already taken to promote market stabilisation is described in paragraph 20 on page 8 and the Government will continue to watch developments closely.Brucellosis11. In the interests of both human and animal health the Government areconcerned that brucellosis should be eradicated from the national herd as soonas practicable. The process of brucellosis eradication is bound to spread overa number of years though in Northern Ireland it is already well advanced.As already announced, compulsory eradication projects will start next year in specially selected areas of Great Britain. To ensure the success of this programme the Government have decided upon new measures to accelerate the build-up and maintenance of disease-free herds, and so sustain thereservoir of replacements as eradication programmes gather momentum. Thegeneral objective is to ensure that, while compulsory eradication is proceeding in some areas, voluntary accreditation will advance elsewhere in the country.12. The new measures are designed to give owners of clean, or relatively clean,herds special encouragement to seek early voluntary accreditation leaving themore heavily infected herds to await compulsory eradication. With this in mind the present voluntary Brucellosis (Accredited Herds) Scheme in Great Britainwill be replaced by an Incentives Scheme offering new payments for healthy herdsinstead of compensation for certain reacting animals. These incentives willtake the form of a gallonage premium on milk from accredited dairy herdsand, for accredited beef herds, a supplement to the hill cow and beef cowsubsidies. The incentives for 1970/71 will be lid. a gallon for milk and37s. 6d. for each qualifying beef animal and these will be payable to the ownersconcerned at not less than these rates for a period of five years whether or notthe rates for new entrants to the scheme are altered in later years. They arenot intended to alter the price relativities of milk and beef. Owners will berequired to make approved arrangements for slaughter of reactors.13. No further applications will be admitted under the present Scheme;but there will be provision for herds participating in this Scheme to transfer tothe new Incentives Scheme in due course. Herds that are already accredited,and are transferred in this way, will qualify for the milk incentive paymentretrospectively from 1st April 1970 or, where appropriate, the beef supplementfor the calendar year 1970.14. The outline arrangements for the new Scheme have been worked out inclose consultation with the leaders of the industry and the Milk marketing boards, and full details will be announced in due course. Meantime, dis-cussions have started on the parallel arrangements and conditions for compul-sory eradication programmes for which any incentive payments will be augmented by flat rate &quot;replacement grants&quot; for each slaughtered animal.15. Northern Ireland is already in the concluding stages of a compulsoryeradication programme, and will therefore be a valuable source of disease-freereplacements. The principle of introducing incentives, in lieu of compensation,will be applied there under arrangements to be made by the Northern ireland government.
16. The precise benefit of the new scheme to livestock enterprises mustlargely depend upon the response of farmers, but the new incentives are expectedto increase returns to owners of accredited herds by some  5 million in a full year&apos;s operation of the scheme. The total would build up in later years as thenumber of accredited herds increases. The agricultural industry will benefitnot only from the incentive payments to the farmers concerned but also fromthe higher yields and lower costs in healthy herds.Sheep and Wool17. The sheep breeding flock fell by just under 2\ per cent between December1967 and December 1968, and by a further A\ per cent in the year to December1969. Some fall was expected during the year, but lowland flock numbershave fallen at a faster rate than forecast and some hill areas suffered heavy losses in the hard weather early in 1969. Some further reduction in the breedingflock is expected in the year to December 1970.18. Home-fed supplies of mutton and lamb for 1969/70 (July/June) are estimated at some 6 per cent lower than in 1968/69. An increase in importsof about 4 per cent is expected. Total supplies of mutton and lamb in 1969/70are estimated to be about the same as in 1968/69. The drop in home productionreflects the continuing decline in the breeding flock and the effect of weatherlosses.19. The Government have sought through their decisions at recent annual reviews to encourage greater productivity and growth in the hills and uplandsto offset the decline in lowland flock numbers, but this will take time. More-over sheep are important to husbandry in many lowland areas. If production is to be maintained over the longer term, it is necessary to check and offset the decline in the total breeding flock. To offset higher costs and to give thefurther resources needed for investment in additional breeding stock, the guaranteed price for fat sheep will go up by 3d. to 3s. lOjd. per lb. Thisshould improve returns for producers in all parts of the country and in allsectors of the industry.20. Although market prices of wool in the last two seasons have been higherthan in 1967/68, the rate of subsidy is still a relatively large part of the totalreturn to the producer.   The guaranteed price for wool will remain unchanged.Pigs21. The breeding herd has now been expanding for over three years. Itsnumbers went up by 3 per cent in the year to June 1969 and some further increase is expected in the year to June 1970. The number of pigs certifiedfor the guarantee in 1969/70 (April/March) is estimated at 13&apos;3 million, 6 percent up on the preceding year.22. Home pork production in 1969/70 (July/June) is expected to be some4 per cent higher than in 1968/69. Home bacon production is expected toreach 235,000 tons in 1969/70-4  per cent above the level of 1968/69. Thelevel of United Kingdom production provided for under the Bacon MarketSharing Understanding is 233,600 tons in 1969/70 and 239,000 tons in 1970/71(April/March years).
23. Pigmeat is a priority commodity under the selective expansion programme.The objective is two-fold. The Government want home production of pork to expand to meet the growth in demand. For bacon the policy is to encouragean expansion in the supply of British bacon based on increased productivity and improved marketing.24. As already announced, a number of modifications in the bacon stabilisation-tion arrangements were introduced at the end of 1969 which substantially increased the payments to bacon curers. This followed the examination bythe Industrial Reorganisation Corporation of the structure of the UnitedKingdom bacon curing industry and the stabilisation arrangements. TheGovernment have laid before Parliament a scheme to continue these arrange-ments for a period of approximately three years after the expiry of the present scheme on 31st March 1970.25. Feedingstuffs account for a large part of costs to the pig producer andthe effective guaranteed price is automatically adjusted under the feed formula for changes in these costs. The present formula, which is based upon an indexrelated to the price of compound feedingstuffs, was introduced for a trial period in 1967/68. The Government have now reviewed its operation. Theyhave decided that an index based upon the prices of both compounds andstraights would more accurately reflect changes in the feed costs actually borneby producers. A new index on this basis will accordingly be introduced fromthe beginning of the 1970/71 guarantee year. Details are given in Appendix VI,Part II, paragraph 9.26. The effective guaranteed price is also modified if forecast certificationsexceed or fall short of the limits of the middle band in the flexible guaranteescale. The existing middle band is wide enough to allow a substantial expansion in forecast certifications without any cut in the effective guaranteed price. Ithas therefore been decided to provide the incentive and resources for expansionentirely through an increase in the end price. The basic guaranteed price willbe raised by Is. Od. per score to 50s. lid. This action, together with the revision of the bacon stabilisation arrangements and the special measures toincrease the rates of the capital grants outlined in paragraphs 48 to 52 below,should ensure the steady increase in production proposed in the selective expansion programme.Eggs27. In 1968/69 output for human consumption was at a record level and afurther 1 per cent increase is expected in 1969/70. Packing station throughputover 1969/70 as a whole is expected to be about the same as in 1968/69 due toa recovery in the second half of the year. Prices have continued their recoveryfrom the very low levels of 1967.28. The objective under the selective expansion programme is to remainbroadly self-sufficient in eggs and this is being achieved. In January 1969,the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food announced that the egg subsidy would be phased out over the next five years by reduction of the guaranteed price. The first steps to this end were taken at the 1969 Annual Review.Production is developing satisfactorily and further steps are being taken thisyear.29. From 1970/71 the egg subsidy will be on a flat-rate basis, as foreshadowed in the 1969 Annual Review White Paper.  To achieve this the profit and loss
sharing and import compensation arrangements will be abolished. In order tocontinue the phasing out of the subsidy the guaranteed price for hen eggs willbe reduced by l-43d. per dozen.30. For duck eggs the profit and loss sharing arrangements will also be abolished and the guaranteed price will be reduced by 2-31d. per dozen.31. In 1970/71 the British Egg Marketing Board will be operating in thelast year of its existence under difficult conditions. To safeguard the Board&apos;position in the market and to facilitate its forward planning it is desirable to limit to some extent the fluctuations in the Board&apos;s subsidy income which might otherwise result from variations in the level of packing station throughputduring the year. The standard quantity for hen eggs in 1970/71 will thereforebe fixed with an upper limit of 651 million dozen eggs as in 1969/70 but therewill also be a lower limit of 480 million dozen eggs in order to provide a propor-tionate increase in the basic rate of subsidy (subject to a maximum rate of subsidy of 5d. per dozen) if throughput falls below the lower limit. The standard quantity arrangement which will operate on a seasonal basis in self-containedaccounting periods is described more fully in Appendix VI, Part II, paragraph 12.Cereals32. The cereals acreage fell to 9-1 million in 1969 due, in large measure, tothe setback to ploughing caused by the bad weather in many areas whichpersisted from the summer of 1968 to the spring of 1969. At December 1969there was a marked increase in the acreage sown to winter wheat and in 1970the total cereals acreage is expected to recover to at least the record level of 1967.33. The harvest of 1968 was exceptionally poor and production fell justbelow 13 million tons. Yields of all cereals in 1969/70 were much better thanin 1968/69. The 1969 harvest is thus expected to reach about 13&apos;5 million tons.Cereals usage in 1969/70 is likely to be some i million tons higher than in1968/69 mainly on account of increased animal feed requirements. imports are likely to be slightly above the level of 1968/69. Market prices are expectedto be broadly similar to last year.34. Wheat and barley are priority commodities under the selective expansion programme and the aim is expansion to the full extent that is technicallypossible and consistent with reasonable resource use and support cost. Theeffect of the increases in the guaranteed prices given in the last two years hashowever been eroded by the bad harvest and planting conditions of 1968/69.Output and incomes of cereals growers were severely reduced in that year. In1969/70 there should be some recovery. But further incentives are needed toensure that farmers have the resources and confidence to get progress in the cereal sector moving forward more quickly. In addition the differential infavour of wheat (which offers the biggest scope for import-saving) should beincreased.   So the guaranteed price for wheat will be raised by Is. 3d. to 30s. 3d. percwt; and the guaranteed price for barley will be raised by Is. Od. to 27s. Od. per cwt.There will be no change in the guaranteed price for oats or for rye.35. These increases in the guarantees should lead to a significant increase inprofitability. Cereals growers should also benefit greatly from the exceptional measures being taken to increase the rates of fertiliser subsidy for 1970/71(paragraph 45 below).
36. The target indicator prices for 1970/71 will be 21s. 3d. per cwt. for wheat and 20s. 4d. per cwt. for barley.   (Appendix VI, Part II, paragraph 13.)37. Following the proposal in the Britton Report on Cereals Marketing, it isthe Governments intention that the deficiency payment on wheat (at presentpaid on a tonnage basis) should be paid on an acreage basis with effect from 1st July 1971; but the Government are prepared to have further discussions with the interests concerned before reaching a final decision in the autumn of 1970.38. The acreage grant on field beans which was introduced for the 1968 crop asa pump-priming measure comes to an end in 1970/71. The value of the cropas a break in the cereals rotation is now sufficiently well recognised not torequire further financial encouragement. The purpose of the grant has accordingly been achieved and the grant will not be extended beyond 1970/71.The prospects for other break crops have also been reviewed but none hasbeen found which warrants the short-term stimulus of a break crop grant at thisstage. iPotatoes39. The objective for main crop potatoes continues to be that, except in years of unusually low yields, home production should meet home demand infull.40. The 1968 U.K. crop from 690,000 acres gave rise to a surplus of 173,000tons; this would have been greater had it not been for losses due to flooding,waterlogging and poor keeping quality. In accordance with arrangements described in paragraph 58 of the 1969 Annual Review White Paper, a targetacreage of 650,000 was fixed for the 1969 crop. The acreage actually planted,however, was only 614,000 mainly due to bad planting weather in the spring.A marginal shortage of supplies may emerge towards the end of the season.41. A U.K. target acreage of 650,000 has again been set for 1970. With the encouragement of good market prices for the 1969 crop and given normalplanting conditions this acreage should be achieved. Unless yields are unusuallylow the crop should then be more than sufficient to meet home demand.42. To allow for increased costs and to give farmers a return from the 1970crop that will encourage them to maintain the acreage necessary for self-sufficiency, the guaranteed price will go up by 15s. Od. per ton to 317s. 6d.per ton.Sugar Beet43. The objective for sugar beet is that the present acreage should be main-tained. This is expected to lead to some increase in production over the yearsdue to increased yields though in some years, as in 1969/70, low yields may leadto a drop in production. Consumption of sugar is, at best, static and committedsupplies under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement and from home productionvery nearly meet the whole of domestic sugar consumption. The contractacreage for 1971/72 will therefore remain unchanged. As there is no difficultyin having the contract acreage taken up, the guaranteed price for 1970/71 willalso remain unchanged.Production Grants44. Fertiliser and Lime Subsidies. Fertiliser usage has increased steadily butthe rate of increase has slackened off during 1969/70.   The general policy
has been to reduce subsidy rates, as usage increases, in order to contain thecost of the subsidy. For lime the general level of the subsidy has remained unchanged since 1966. Consumption has fallen over the last few years, though this trend appears to have been checked in 1969.45. Against the background of the industry&apos;s immediate needs and in orderto meet this year&apos;s special circumstances there will be a one-year increase in therates of subsidy on fertilisers and lime, as a means of increasing the resourcesof the industry. The rates of fertiliser subsidy will be increased by about20 per cent and the rates of lime subsidy by about 15 per cent. These increases should provide an extra  9 million through the fertiliser subsidy and  1 millionthrough the lime subsidy. The higher rates will be paid on all deliveries madeon or after 19th March so that farmers can begin to benefit at once. this could be especially helpful this year as farmers have tended to delay their pur-chases and stocks have built up. It should also enable farmers, to plan theirforward purchases to achieve the best results for their businesses, and soprovide a continuing and widespread benefit to the industry throughout theyear.46. This action is not a reversal of previous policy on these subsidies: theyhave been chosen simply to provide a once and for all addition of some 10 million to farmers&apos; resources. Fertilisers and lime are of course basicinputs and proper use is important in maximising farm output.47. Small Farm (Business Management) Scheme. This scheme was intro-duced in 1965 and was further extended for one year at the 1969 Review. Thenumber of applications under the scheme has continued to fall and is now at avery low level.   It will not be renewed when it expires on 31st August 1970.Capital Grants48. A number of agricultural capital grants are not included within theguarantee system because they are payable mainly on items which are alandlords responsibility. But the profitability of farming directly influencesthe level of investment which in turn affects the ability of farmers to expand their production. As mentioned in paragraph 10 of Annex A, although grant-aidedinvestment in buildings and works in 1969 was at a record level, there haverecently been signs of a downturn. So special measures being taken this yearto ensure that farmers have the resources they need for expansion will include a two-year increase in the rates of the main capital grants to agriculture designedto inject a total of some  20 million or more.49. Under the proposed arrangements, most of which are subject to theapproval of Parliament, the rates of the main farm capital grants will be increasedby 10 percentage points. The total rate on items approved under the farm improvement Scheme will go up to 40 per cent. ; Grants on mains water supply for farms will also rise to 40 per cent (except in Scotland and Northern Irelandwhere higher rates are already being paid). Similarly there will be an increase from 50 per cent to 60 per cent in the rates of grant for field drainage, forremodelling works under the Farm Amalgamation and Boundary AdjustmentsScheme and for the Hill Land Improvement Scheme, with an increase from60 per cent to 70 per cent for field drainage on hill land. The agriculturalinvestment grant on buildings and fixed equipment (paid mainly on expenditure which does not qualify for other grants) will receive a larger increase raisinga21
the rate from 10 per cent to 30 per cent. This will be of particular benefit topig producers and others with a livestock enterprise who grow little of the feedthey require. There is, however, to be an upper limit to the amount of invest-ment qualifying for this grant on any single farm unit, so that where an investment programme for a separate farm unit exceeds the limit the excesswould not be approved for grant. Subject to review in the light of experiencethe limit will be  100,000 investment over two years.50. In the case of the agricultural investment grant, the increased rate will apply to expenditure incurred on or after 19th March. For the other schemes the new rates will apply to all proposals or applications approved or submitted on or after that date. These arrangements should give a considerable incentive to new investment.51. The Government have already announced their intention to replace theexisting capital grants to agriculture by a unified Farm Capital Grant scheme with a basic rate of 30 per cent and a higher rate of 50 per cent for drainage,improvements to hill land and remodelling works for farm amalgamations(60 per cent for drainage in the hills). This will take the place ofeleven existing schemes, including all those mentioned above. It should use the available funds more directly to encourage improved productivity andshould simplify the conditions of the schemes, reduce administrative costs andcut out much paper work both for the industry and for the Government.52. In view of the increases now proposed in the rates of capital grants, itis intended that, until 18th March 1972 only, the rates under the unified scheme should be set at 40 per cent for the basic rate and 60 per cent for the higher rate(70 per cent for drainage in the hills).

Their exclusion did not affect the 1968 cropping,and stocking figures for the United Kingdom by more than 0.4 per cent in the case of any single item shown inthe Table. Until 1954, figures for Northern Ireland included holdings of one quarter acre or more. From1954, they relate to holdings of one acre or more. Numbers of livestock in Northern Ireland are collected fromall owners irrespective of the size of the holdings, and also from landless stockholders, and these numbers areincluded in the Table.(ii) Owing to changes in the definition of &quot; Temporary grass &quot; in the agricultural census, figures from 1959 onwardfor this item are not directly comparable with those for earlier years.

The figures in brackets for 1968/69 and 1969/70 are adjusted to normal weather conditions.Note (Hi). The &quot; Departmental&quot; and &quot; raised sample &quot; estimates of aggregatefarming net income in Table A are arrived at after making provision for depreciation.Net income is defined as the reward for the manual and managerial labour of the farmer and his wife, and for the use of the occupier&apos;s investment.Note (iv). These two series of aggregate farming net income are calculated indifferent ways. The &quot; Departmental &quot; estimate is built up from statistics of income and expenditure for the whole &quot; national&quot; farm and its components are shown inTable B. The &quot; raised sample &quot; is based on some 3,600 actual farm accounts whichare expanded or &quot; raised &quot; to give an aggregate for all farms in the United Kingdom.Both series are of value in indicating the general trend of income but there are anumber of reasons why the levels of net income shown in the two series should vary.It is difficult to make a quantitative assessment of the individual causes of this variationand both estimates are subject to a margin of error. The farm accounts forming thebasis of the &quot; raised sample &quot; are provided voluntarily by farmers through UniversitiesAggregate Farming Net Income in the United kingdom note. The revised figures given in this Appendix for the &quot; Departmental &quot; calcula-tion of aggregate net income in the year 1968/69 replace the forecasts which were published in last year&apos;s White Paper when the outcome for the latter part of that year was not known. In addition new statistical information which has become availableaffects the figures for 1968/69 and some earlier years. Forecasts for 1969/70 are asat mid-January 1970.
and Colleges of Agriculture in Great Britain and the Ministry of Agriculture inNorthern Ireland. The sample is not fully representative, however, particularly asregards pig, poultry and horticultural holdings and very large businesses. In additionmost farm accounts relate to either a calendar year or an April-March year, theaverage year-ending date being about mid-February. The &quot; Departmental &quot; estimaterelates to a year ending 31st May. This difference in year-ending dates can give riseto a difference in trend between the two series, since the results are affected by weather and other conditions. The revised series for the &quot; raised sample &quot; calculation isbased on a new raising method.Note (v). The &quot; Departmental&quot; estimates for aggregate net income include asprofit in recent years about  7 million on the production of food for consumption inthe farm household.

Part of the valuation change included in the &quot; Departmental&quot; figuresfor aggregate net income represents the excess of replacement cost over original costof certain assets (slaughter stock, cultivations, growing crops, etc.) used up in thecourse of the year&apos;s production and trade.

As pointed out in paragraph 5 on page 11, theannual rate of gain in the industry&apos;s efficiency is estimated to be of the order of  30 million for guaranteed products.(//) The figures given above exclude an increase of approximately  6-4 million in respectof changes in feedingstuffs costs which are dealt with automatically by the feed formula which relates the guarantee for pigs to the cost of a basic feed ration.(///) The expression &quot; Guaranteed Products &quot; means the commodities, of the grades anddescriptions for which guaranteed prices are provided, listed in Tables A and B in Part Iof Appendix VI.(iv) This deduction is made to provide a sum in lieu of the training levies payable by agricultural and horticultural producers in Great Britain. Subject to the approval ofParliament of the necessary legislative provision, this sum will be paid to the Agriculture,Horticulture and Forestry Industry Training Board. In the first three years, the payment will cover both the Board&apos;s current expenses and the repayment of the outstanding loan forits expenses from 1st September 1969 to 31st March 1970 and the interest on it. Theamount required by the Board in 1970/71 has been determined by the Secretary of Statefor Employment and Productivity at  1-9 million. Similar arrangements are being introduced for the financing of training in Northern Ireland through the NorthernIreland Ministry of Agriculture. The cost of this training in 1970/71 will be carried forward and added to the full year cost at the 1971 Annual Review.A similar procedure will be followed in future years in the event of changes in the levels of these payments.

Note (/). &quot; Relevant production grants &quot;. Expenditure on these grants is taken into account in calculating the total value of the guarantees at the Annual Review. The item &quot; Other &quot;under this heading includes grants in respect of grassland renovation, rabbit clearance societies,producers in the Scottish Islands, agricultural marketing development, agriculturalco-operation (excluding fixed equipment), and agricultural credit.Note (it). &quot; Other grants and-subsidies &quot;. Expenditure on these grants is not taken intoaccount in calculating the total value of the guarantees. The item &quot; Other &quot; under this heading includes grants in respect of livestock improvement, bracken eradication, and fixedequipment for agricultural co-operatives.Note (iii). General explanation of figures. The figures in I, II, III and IV for years up toand including 1968/69 represent actual expenditure recorded in the Appropriation Accounts.The figures for 1969/70 are the latest estimates (Hansard 28th January 1970, written answers,columns 353-354) of cash expenditure in the United Kingdom (Civil Estimates Class V,Votes 3, 4, 5, 6 and parts of Votes 2 and 7). The figures for 1970/71 are those in thecorresponding Civil Estimates for that year.Note (iv).   Explanation of particular figures.(a) Payments in respect of cereals, potatoes and wool relate partly to the crops or clipof the year indicated and partly to the crops or clips of the preceding year or years.(b) Expenditure on tuberculosis eradication relates to bonus payments under the AttestedHerds Scheme only and excludes compensation payments for slaughtered reactors.(c) Ploughing grants in 1968/69 included  0-7 million under the  10 Emergency PaymentsScheme which is &quot; non-relevant &quot;.(d) The investment incentive grants to agriculture were payable for the first time in 1967/68.They replaced investment allowances and, unlike them, take the form of cashpayments instead of tax concessions.Note (v). Estimated effect of determinations on Estimates 1970/71. On the basis of theoriginal assumptions as to output and market prices, the main effects on agricultural supportby the Exchequer in 1970/71 of the commodity determinations set out in this White Paperare estimated to be broadly increases of  2  million on wheat,  7 million on barley,  9 J million on cattle,  3 million on sheep and  4J million on pigs and a decrease of  4 million on eggs.The net effect of the determinations on the estimates differs from the effect on the valueof the guarantees for several reasons; the more important are that the price guarantee arrangements for some commodities do not involve Exchequer payments and that the paymentperiods for some items do not correspond with the financial year.Note (vi). The Table excludes grants specifically for horticulture. The estimated cost ofthese, together with horticultural co-operation and credit, is  7-4 million in 1969/70 and 80 million in 1970/71.

( 6-825) (/;)Notes on Price Tables(a) Guarantee payments for fatstock are made weekly by reference to standard prices.For cattle and sheep these are on a pre-determined seasonal scale and payments are subjectto abatements and supplements under the graduated deficiency payments scheme. these arrangements should normally mean that the guaranteed price for the year is paid exactly;but circumstances can arise where marketings and prices vary from those forecast in such away that the producers&apos; average return exceeds the guaranteed price for the year. Becauseof the weekly basis of payment this can happen for cattle, sheep or pigs if market prices gohigher than the standard prices in some weeks and in others guarantee payments are made.For pigs, the method of calculating the guarantee involves an element of estimation and canresult in the producers&apos; average return differing slightly from the guaranteed price.(b) The guaranteed price for pigs is subject to the flexible guarantee and feed formulaarrangements.(c) After 15th February 1971 deficiency payments will be calculated in decimal currency.It will be necessary at that time to determine new scales of abatements and supplements forcattle and sheep. The objective will be to provide for adjustments under these new scalesto be as nearly as possible the same as those provided for in the scales described in Part ii of this Appendix.(d) The guaranteed prices for hen and duck eggs are subject to the indicator price arrange-ments and the guaranteed price for hen eggs is subject to the standard quantity arrangements.(e) The guaranteed price for milk is subject to the standard quantity arrangements and includes 0-25d. per gallon special assistance for compositional quality.(/) The guaranteed prices for wheat and barley are subject to the target indicator price arrangements.(g) In order to promote orderly marketing throughout the season, the guaranteed price for wheat is subject to the operation of a seasonal scale and the guaranteed price for barley to arrangements whereby premiums are paid for barley delivered, after sale, in the later monthsof the cereal year and deductions made for barley delivered in the early months of the year.(It) The decimal equivalents, rounded where necessary, in brackets in column (iii) are forinformation only.
Part II.  Additional Details of guarantees. The guaranteed prices shown in Part I of this Appendix for livestock and livestock products in 1970/71 and for crops of the 1970 harvest will be on a similar basis tothose for the previous year except as stated in the following paragraphs.Milk2. The provisional standard quantity for each area in 1970/71 has been calculated as follows: 		Million gallons		Provisional	Adjustments	Provisional	Standard	for Changes	Standard	Quantity	in Liquid	Ouantity	1969/70	Sales	1970/71England and Wales	1,826-0	+22-0	1,848-0Main Scottish Area	189-7	4- 0-5	190-2Aberdeen and District ...	20-5	+ 0-1	20-north of Scotland	10-7	-t- 0-2	10-northern Ireland	104-7	+ 1-2	105-9	2,151-6	+24-0	2,175-63. The final figures for the standard quantities for 1969/70 for each of the five milk marketing areas are as follows: Million gallonsEngland and Wales.....................      1,838-5Main Scottish Area.....................        190-2Aberdeen and District       .................. 20-north of Scotland   ..................... 10-7Northern Ireland     .....................        105-42,165-5Fat Cattle4. Graduated Deficiency Payments Scheme. With effect from 30th March 1970the scale of abatements and supplements will be adjusted to take account of the expected market situation for the year. If the average market price for a week isbelow the standard price for the same week, and the deficiency is within the range18s. Od. to 24s. Od. per live cwt., a guarantee payment of the amount of this deficiencywill be paid in respect of the week: but if the deficiency in the week exceeds 24s. Od.per cwt., or is less than 18s. Od. per cwt., the guarantee payment will be subject toabatement or supplement in accordance with scales determined at the Review, whichare being published separately.5. These arrangements will be amended if, in the light of the discussions on marketstabilisation which are now in progress, Orders are made to provide for minimum prices and supporting levies on imports. In that event the intention would be to end the Graduated Deficiency Payment Scheme; to determine a scale of weekly targetindicator prices relating to the level of minimum import prices; and to reduce the deficiency payments made weekly and after the end of the fatstock year by referenceto any amount by which the average market price realised fell short respectively ofthe target indicator price for the week or the annual average of target indicator price as weighted by weekly certifications.6. Qualifying standards. The minimum weights for animals in the young lightweightclass will be reduced to 410 lb. dressed carcase weight in the case of steers and bullsand 345 lb. dressed carcase weight in the case of heifers. The minimum eligibleweights for animals in this class presented at liveweight will be 6f cwt. in the case ofsteers and 5-f- cwt. in the case of heifers.
Fat Sheep7. Graduated Deficiency Payments Scheme. With effect from 31st March 1970 thescale of abatements and supplements will be adjusted to take account of the expectedmarket situation for the year. If the average market price for a week is below thestandard price for the same week, and the deficiency is within the range fd. to 2Jd.per lb. estimated dressed carcase weight, a guarantee payment of the amount of this deficiency will be paid in respect of the week: but if the deficiency in the week exceeds2 d. per lb., or is less than fd. per lb., the guarantee payment will be subject to abate-ment or supplement in accordance with scales determined at the Review, which arebeing published separately.8. Special provision for light sheep. The special provision whereby any abatementsunder the graduated deficiency payments scheme are reduced in respect of lambsweighing 41 lbs. or less will be extended to cover sheep in the same weight rangemarketed in weeks 15-40 of the fatstock year. Thus any abatement in respect ofsheep will, in any of these weeks, be reduced as follows: (a) on sheep of 38 lb. and under, estimated dressed carcase weight, any abate-ment will be reduced by 2d., or, if the abatement is less than 2d., by suchlesser amount as will reduce the abatement to nil;(b) on sheep of 39 lb., 40 lb. and 41 lb. estimated dressed carcase weight, anyabatement will be reduced in the same manner as in (a) above by ljd., Id.and id. respectively.Fat Pigs9. Feedingstuffs Formula. In 1970/71 the guaranteed price will continue to besubject to adjustment in respect of changes in the price of a feed ration. This rationwill consist of a representative selection of compound and straight feedingstuffs(not compounds alone as during the past three years) priced from information notified to the Agricultural Departments by a representative selection of compounders andprovender millers. Changes in the price of the ration will continue to be expressedin terms of an index. The feed price of 35s. lid. per cwt. to which the new guaranteed price is related, is deemed to be equivalent to 1,000 points on the index. For everymovement of 9 points from 1,000 points (equivalent to 4d. per cwt.), the guaranteed price will be adjusted by 3d. per score.Eggs10. Indicator Price and Risk Sharing Arrangements. As announced in paragraph 50of the 1969 Annual Review White Paper (Cmnd. 3965) the profit and loss sharingarrangements will be abolished as from the beginning of the 1970/71 guarantee year.The basic rate of subsidy will be the difference between the guaranteed price andthe indicator price. In 1970/71 the indicator prices will remain unchanged at 3s. Id.per dozen for hen eggs and 2s. 2d. per dozen for duck eggs.11. Import Compensation Arrangements. As stated in paragraph 29 of Annex b of this White Paper the import compensation arrangements described in Part II of appendix VI to the 1963 Annual Review White Paper (Cmnd. 1968) will be abolishedfrom the beginning of the 1970/71 guarantee year.12. Standard Quantity for Hen Eggs. For the guarantee year 1970/71 there willbe a standard quantity for hen eggs with an upper limit of 651 million dozen and a lower limit of 480 million dozen of first quality eggs sold through packing stations.The guarantee year will be divided into seasonal periods to each of which will be allocated a part of the standard quantity on the basis of actual throughput in the equivalent period in previous years. The subsidy will be paid to the British EggMarketing Board on the throughput of first quality eggs. It will be at the basic rateof subsidy (that is at 3-64d. per dozen) if the throughput in a seasonal period is betweenthe upper and the lower limit of the standard quantity allocated to that period. Itwill be at the basic rate of subsidy divided by the proportion which the throughputduring a seasonal period bears to the upper limit of the standard quantity for thatperiod if the throughput is greater than this upper limit.   It will be at the basic rate
of subsidy divided by the proportion which the throughput during a seasonal periodbears to the lower limit of the standard quantity for that period if the throughputis less than this limit, provided that the rate of subsidy as adjusted by this arrangementdoes not exceed 5d. per dozen.Cereals13. Target Indicator Prices. These prices are related to the current minimum import prices for the appropriate grains after allowing for handling differentials and quality differences. For the cereal year 1970/71 the target indicator prices will be21s. 3d. per cwt. for wheat and 20s. 4d. per cwt. for barley.Sugar Beet14. For the 1970 crop the maximum acreage to which the guarantee will applywill be 427,400 acres in England and Wales and 15,600 acres in Scotland. Themaximum acreage for the 1971 crop will be the same as in 1970.
