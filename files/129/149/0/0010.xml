Under section 2 of the Commonwealth immigrants Act 1962 a commonwealth citizen has a right of entry to the United Kingdom if he cansatisfy the immigration officer that he is in a position to support himselfwithout working,    Entry can be refused only for the following reasons -(i)   On medical grounds(ii)   Because of criminal records or(iii)   if admission would &quot;in the opinion of the Secretary of Statebe contrary to the interests of national security&quot;.Only the last is relevant here.    It might be argued that the power to refuseentry on security grounds was inserted in the statute as a safeguard againstpeople coming here on intelligence or espionage missions, but a widerinterpretation is not precluded.    In view of the grave economic and strategic implications of admitting Colonel Ojukwu I think that thisprovision can properly be used to bar his entry.     The Attorney-general has concurred in the view that this would be a proper use of the statutory provision, although he does not exclude the possibility that, if the issuewere to come before the courts, a different view might prevail,3. It may be useful to set out the reasons why it seemed necessary to reject two other possible ways of preventing Colonel Ojukwu from cominghere.1TOP SECRET_      ........_____________________.........
4.        One suggestion was that we should invite the Nigerian Governmentto deprive him of his Nigerian citizenship, so depriving him of hisstatutory right of entry to this country.    The difficulty about this coursei3 that we could not guarantee to be able to deny entry even if the nigerian Government were to act upon our suggestion.    In the first place,even if he were deprived of Nigerian citizenship by an act which would berecognised by our courts, there can be no assurance that he might notsubsequently be granted citizenship by some other Commonwealth country.In the second place, whether Colonel Ojukwu were to arrive here as a commonwealth citizen, or as an alien or as a Stateless Person, we cannotsay in advance that he might not have a valid claim for political asylum asa refugee, according to the definition in the Convention on the Status of refugees (Crond. 8465) to which we are a party.    It is true that he hasfound refuge in the Ivory Coast, but there can be no assurance that hewould still be acceptable in that country after he had come here, or thatsome other third country would be prepared to grant him refuge.    IfNigeria were the only country of return, we could not evade a claim for political asylum and we might find it difficult to reject it.    In that event,and assuming that we had encouraged the Nigerian Government to withdrawColonel Ojukwu&apos;s citizenship, oiu* last state would be worse than our first,5. The second suggestion was that we should stimulate the nigerian government to apply for extradition as a means of frighteningColonel Ojukwu away.    But if a warrant were issued in Nigeria for arelevant offence within section 3(1) of the Fugitive Offenders Act 1967 andthe Nigerian Government applied for his return, it would be open to him to claim that he should not be surrendered, on the grounds set out insection 4(1) of the Act, namely, that the offence for which his return wassought was political or that his position would he prejudiced on account ofhis race, religion, nationality or political opinions.    The Attorney-General agrees that such a claim would probably be upheld by the courts.Colonel Ojukwu1 s advisers in this country would be well aware of the factthat no court would be likely to order his return to Nigeria.6.        While I consider that the exclusion of Colonel Ojukwu on security grounds can be justified, it would be unwise to underestimate the amountof criticism that the decision might attract, in Parliament and elsewhere.It could clearly be undesirable to allow the controversy to be spun out byway of legal proceedings, and accordingly the instructions to the immigration Service are to refuse entry promptly, to deny communicationsfacilities, and to put Colonel Ojukwu on the next &apos;plane for the country fromwhich he embarked for the United Kingdom.    Instructions on these lines would have to be disclosed if the occasion arose to act upon them.    Theywould be criticised as high-handed, but I think we must stand by them.7. The statutory immigration appeal system is shortly to be introduced.This would not alter &quot;the basis for refusal of entry, but Colonel Ojukwuwould have to be allowed to stay here to exercise his rights of appeal.    the appeal in a security case is to a special panel of the Immigration AppealsTribunal and their conclusion is advisory only.    There are provisions forcertifying that certain matters should not be disclosed to the appellant if2
this would be contrary to the interests of national security.    A decision could probably be reached in a few days, and although an adjudicatorcould, in theory, grant bail, it is likely that in practice Colonel Ojukwucould be kept in custody during that time,EXPULSION AFTER ENTRY8.        Despite our best endeavours, Colonel Ojukwu might not be identified on his examination at the port and might consequently beadmitted as a visitor under the Act of 1962.    If this happened, as aresult of deception on his part, it would be unwise to attempt a secondexamination on the ground that the first one should be regarded as a nullity.The Attorney-General has advised that the courts would almost certainlyreject this argument if habeas corpus proceedings were taken onColonel Ojukwuts behalf following re-examination and refusal.    It follows that, where deception had been practised, one course would be to prosecute Colonel Ojukwu for giving false information in the hope that thecourt would recommend deportation.    Under the .1962 Act, it is howeveropen to me to vary the condition which determines the length of stay of avisitor and whether Colonel Ojukwu had obtained entry by deception or through oversight on the part of the immigration service I could vary hispermitted length of stay in a way which would require him to leave forth-with.    Once the appropriate provisions (section 16) of the immigration appeals Act are brought into effect, if Colonel Ojukwu failed to leave incompliance with the condition as varied, I could deport hiro (subject to anappeal which would result in an advisory recommendation) and therewould be no need for a prosecution and court recommendation.9.        There is another source of danger.   If Colonel Ojukwu wereadmitted by the Republic of Ireland he would then be free to come to theUnited Kingdom.     If he crossed the land border into Northern Ireland,he would in practise be free of all immigration control for the duration of his stay in the United Kingdom and could come to this country and remainhere.    I see no way round this,    K he came here openly direct from theRepublic, we could within 28 days of his arrival require him. to submit toexamination, refuse him entry on security grounds and send him away.If he came unrecognised from the Republic, and we did not discover his presence here until 28 days had elapsed, I am advised that there is no provision in our law under which we could eject him.    The Irishauthorities might have admitted him subject to a time restriction, although this is contrary to their normal practice j but, even if they had done so,there is nothing in our law to say that such a condition has effect in theUnited Kingdom, or that we have power to curtail his stay,CONCLUSION10.      We should refuse permission for Colonel Ojukwu to enter thiscountry, on security grounds.    But the prospect of getting rid of him. if heonce gained entry is -unlikely;- and ou? best course, pretty clearly, is tokeep him in such a state of uncertainty about his reception here that hethink it- better not to take the risk of coming.LJCHome Office, SWlHth April, 1970TOP SECRET
