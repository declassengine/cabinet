DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY SS government financial ASSISTANCE TO PRIVATE industry note by the Minister of technology the Steering Committee on Economic Policy at their meetingon 12th January 1970 invited me to consider with the Chief Secretary,Treasury and the Minister of State, Board of Trade, the implications of a decision to meet the liabilities of Beagle Aircraft Limited, forother Government shareholdings or interests in private industry.2.      The attached paper sets out my appreciation of the position.It has been prepared by my Department in the light of the Attorney-General8s opinion, given jointly with Counsel, on certain aspects ofthe Beagle case.    The difficulties attendant on direct government financial intervention in companies are summarised in paragraphs 19-21.3.      I have discussed this paper with the Chief Secretary, Treasury,the Attorny-General and the Minister of State, Board of Trade.    Ihave not been able to reach agreement with the Chief Secretary,Treasury, on the question of the moral or quasi-legal liability *fGovernment in certain situations.    He intends to circulate a paper setting out his views on how financial assistance to private industry should be handled.C(70) 53COPY NO28th April 1970CABINETa, w. b.Ministry of Technology, SW128th April 1970
BEAGLE AIRCRAFT LIMITEDImplications of Government acceptance of liabilityAt the meeting of SEP on 12th January, 1970, theMinister of Technology, in consultation with the chief secretary, Treasury and Minister of State, Board of Trade,was invited to give further consideration to the implications of a decision to meet the liabilities ofBeagle Aircraft Ltdo in the light of the Attorney General&apos;consideration of the legal position of the directors andof whether any implied commitments arose from their action,,BEAGLE OPINION2o     The Attorney General&apos;s opinion given jointly withCounsel, is attached.   Briefly it is that no liabilityattaches to the Directors of the company because theycan fairly have assumed and did assume that theGovernment would pay the creditors *   But the Ministerand officials acting on his behalf knew at the latestfrom 13th October (when the Minister saw the directors)that the company was insolvent at all events unlessthe Government&apos;s loans were treated as if they had beenshare capital; and with this knowledge financed thecompany for a further six weeks for the express and limited purpose of enabling it to continue tradingwithout incurring a compulsory liquidation,   had it not been the Minister&apos;s intention to pay the creditors, parties to such action would be considered as knowingly parties to the carrying on of thebusiness of the company with intent to defraudcreditors, which gives rise to both a civil and criminal/liability - *
liability under Section 332 of the Companies&apos; Act 194-8*This Section does not apply to the Crown, &quot;but this would not,the opinion states, justify the Crown in doing what wouldbe an offence under the section if done by anyone else.The opinion is therefore that the Government cannot nowdisclaim liability to the creditors of the company.LEGAL BACKGROUND3.     The shareholder with fully paid-up shares has in generalno legal liability for.the debts of a   limited.liabilitycompany.   But with the acquisition of the entire equityof a company,    the shareholder is in a legal position toexercise complete control over its operations.   he cannot readily claim that he has no responsibility forthe course of action pursued by the company.   In such circumstances he may therefore be thought to have amoral even though not a legal responsibility for thecompany&apos;s debts.4,     Where a shareholder has a majority holding thoughshort of 100%, effectve control still rests with him and a similar responsibility is liable to arise.However, the position is less clear cut; the minority shareholders may have rights - such as theright to appoint a director to the board - whichmight be thought to reduce the degree of moralresponsibility   lying upon the majority shareholder.According to the circumstances the minority shareholdersmight feel under obligation to meet their share of the debts.5.     A legal or quasi-legal liability, as distinct from a moral liability, may however, arise in some circumstances relevant to this case whether the government&apos;s involvement is by way of a shareholdingor in some other form:-/(a)-2-
(a) Under Section 332 of the Companies Act 194-8as explained in the Beagle Opinion (seeparagraph 2),    the Government is not bound by this provision (except possibly underScottish law) but it is inconceivable thatthe Government would take advantage of this limitation,,    Clearly there can be no question that the Government intervened in thecompany with a dishonest intent to defraud;the Government will have had very differentmotives for intervening connected with public policy (see para. 7 below).   but whatever the motives, the effect oncreditors may be the same.(b) Where a person or body acts as agent for another person the principal is liable forthe contracts entered into by the agentunder the agency and is bound to meet debtswhich arise from them.     The same liabilitycan arise, vhere, although a person has notbeen appointed agent for another, he nasbeen represented as such.6.     A loan increases a company&apos;s indebtedness.,    Ifthe loan is used to pay off some of the existing debts,and the Government defers its loan to the company1sother debts, the ability of the company to pay itsother debts is improved, though the total indebtednessis unchanged-    But if a company is already in difficulties and expands its trade on the strength of the loan, theloan may make it more likely that it will becomeinsolvent and so be acting freudulantly in continuing to trade.   Government assistance by way of subscriptionfor shares or by way of grant avoids any increase ofindebtedness, though Government assistance in any form/could o.-3-
could give rise to a liability under Section 332 of theCompanies Act 19^8, (para 5(a) above) unless it weresufficient to cover all existing debts and provide a working capital besideo   Even then it may be prudent to defer a loan to claims of non-governmental creditors0GOvEPJMENT POSITION IN THE LIGHT OF COMPANY BRACT ICE7c     We-  understand that company practice goes beyondthe legal liability discussed in paragraphs 3-6, andthat responsibility for debts may be accepted even with only a minority shareholding, depending on thecircumstances of involvemento   It would be expectedthat the Government should take no less a degree ofresponsibility in respect of its   shareholdings-Both the Government and.a private sector company willbe assuming a measure, depending on the size of holding,of formal control and of the responsibilities that gowith it, even though the motives of a company and ofthe Government in acquiring an equity interest in a company are likely to be different.      A company taking a shareholding in another will act mainly in the expectation of profit to itself, while the Governmentis likely to be motivated by wider social and economicconsiderationso    Typically the Government would only belikely to acquire an interest in a company in circumstances in which commercial interests were unwilling to do so.   There is likely to be a flavourof &quot;rescuing&quot; the company concernedc     But while this may be thought to render the practice of a company in the private sector of little relevance to theGovernment&apos;s conduct, the very fact of the Government1sintervention will create a presumption in the minds of people trading with the company that the Governmentthinks it worth saving and, by implication, thatit will honour its debtso      This could only be/prevented-4-COMFODENTIAL
prevented by an unequivocal announcement at the timeof the acquisition that the Government was assuming nosuch liabilityo   In a &quot;rescue&quot; situation, this woulddefeat the purpose of the Governmenfs intervention,,80     We believe that it is the normal practice of areputable company in the private sector to pay the debts of a wholly-owned subsidiary and not to standon the limitation of its legal liability.    If thisis the practice in the private sector the Governmentwould be expected to behave in the same way despite thedifference in the motives for acquiring the holding.Moreover a company in the private sector has complete control over its wholly-owned subsidiaries and accordingly they are looked at as part of itsundertaking and its credit involved.     In theorythe Government also has complete control over a wholly-owned subsidiary but in practice the situation may be different.   Where it is a buyer of last resort, the Government may have difficulty in findingand replacing directors and therefore in controllingthem.    It may also have greater difficulty than aprivate sector company in obtaining up-to-date information about the precise financial and tradingposition of the company  rho8e shares it holds.   Moreoverif that company is launching a complex&apos;new &quot;project like an aircraft which requires heavy and lengthy development,cash flow and profitability are difficult to predictand a situation of  \ear insolvency can quicklydevelop where theie, are technical or marketing setbacks.Our conclusion is that the Governmenfs powers of appointment, dismissal and surveillance in thesecircumstances may be difficult to exercise in a way which confers real and effective controlo-5-
Q.     Where the shareholding is less than 100 per cent of the equity, the degree of moral responsibility which would be accepted in the private sector mightbe  educed compared with the wholly-owned case if thepurpose of the shareholding can be seen to imply lessthan full involvement in the affairs of the subsidiaryor associate company.   Where there are minority partners,control is less complete.    The responsibility of theGovernment in such circumstances might be thought tobe correspondingly reduced,,   But the circumstances in which the Government acquired its shareholdingor lent a substantial sum of money to the companymay be such that the creditors would claim thatthey only advanced further money or put off callingin their debts in the expectation that the   company would be sustained by the Government.     Such a claimmight be expected from creditors in Snort Brothersand Harland (in which the Government, through SB(Realizations) Ltd. has a 70 per cent holding) orUpper Clyde Shipbuilders (in which the Governmentand the Shipbuilding Industry Board between them have a 48 per cent holding).    In both cases theGovernment or the Board have given the companiessubstantial loans or other assistance in addition tothe shareholding, some of it at times when thecompanies would otherwise have had to cease trading.On the other hand, B.P. (in which the Governmentholds 49 per cent of the equity) has always^ays been represented as operating free of Government control,and there seems no danger that the Government wouldbe expected to meet debts incurred by the company.10.    The conclusion seems to be that in the Government&apos;scase the degree of support expected by the creditors ina liquidation would depend not so much, on the size or/type .o-6-
type of the shareholding as on the totality of circumstances in which the Government became, andhas continued to be, involved in the company.These seem to be the crucial test of its liabilitywhether legal or otherwise.     The cases where itcan regard itself as clearly free from liabilityare where it has taken up its interest by way of investment, or where it is a long time sinceother motives which might in themselves suggest a degree of liability, have ceased to apply.POSITION WHERE THE GOVERNMENT GIVES FINANCIALISSI^iANCEHJNDER&quot;&quot;STANDART) STATUTORY ARRANGEMENTS11.    There are many cases where the Governmentprovides financial assistance to companies understandard statutory arrangements.   The Board of trade have for many years operated programmes of assistanceto companies in Development Areas (previouslyDevelopment Districts) under the Local EmploymentActs.   Loans are made only on the recommendation ofthe Ministry of Technology Advisory CommitteeMOTAC composed of members from outside the CivilServiceo    The Advisory Committee only recommendloans where they are satisfied that there are good prospects of the undertaking being carried onsuccessfully without further assistance beyond that applied for under the Acts.     The fact of makinga payment under the Acts is then most unlikely toimpose any liability on the Ministry to meet the debts of a company to whom a payment is made.   Tothis there is one exception - there is power (section27 of the Local Employment Act 1960) to make anadditional payment as a form of rescue operation in order to prevent default on a loan by the Ministry.Here there is the risk of a situation involving aGovernment liability on the lines of Section 332./Loans-7-
Loans and grants under the Acts are the subject of agreements which give the Minister various rights in order to ensure repayment of the loan or buildinggrants     In some instances companies give debentureswhich contain provision for protection of the security for example by appointment of a receiver.    The exerciseby the Minister of the rights conferred in this wayinevitably necessitate some degree of involvementwith companies&apos; operations -    There is a possibilityhere too that the Ministry could become in this wayinvolved with a company which was unable to meet its creditors,,   A particular risk is that the Ministryimplementing the policy of the Local Employment Actsto secure the provision of employment might exercise its influence to prolong the life of or acquiesce in the Receiver&apos;s continuance of an insolvent companyso that creditors were defrauded*12c   Under the Science and Technology Act 1965,assistance is mainly provided by way of support for research and development on particular projects orby preproduction orders.     The Minister of Technologygives launching aid to airframe and engine manufacturers,recovering the cost from levies on sales of the product*The Government would normally give such assistanceonly to a company which it thought had the resourcesnecessary, with the assistance, to carry the projectthrougho    In general we would not expect such cases to give rise to a claim that the government hadindirect responsibility for the debts of the companyon a liquidation; but again it would be necessary toconsider the circumstances of a particular case,including the scale of Government involvement inrelation to the size of the company./13-8-
13.   The risks could he greater with assistance to industry under the Industrial Expansion Act 1968.Here too, there is a statutory advisory committee but the Minister is not required to act only on itsrecommendation.     The statute provides that assistance is only to be given when the project would not heundertaken without financial support under the Act,he. where the applicants can demonstrate that theyhave tried and failed to get finance elsewhere.Assistance may take a wide variety of forms includingsubscription of shares.    In fact there have beenhardly any applications for assistance under the Actthough the Minister&apos;s intention is to make greater use of it.     Under this Act the extent of theGovernment&apos;s liability is likely to depend very much on the amount, nature and other circumstances ofthe assistance.    Care will be needed.CONTRACTS14.    It is for consideration whether the Governmentwould be held liable for the debts of other parties on the liquidation of a company which is largely dependent on Government orders.    There are threeimportant points:-(a)   Normal Government contracts are tightly drawnand are administered on a businesslike basisstrictly within their terms.    There&quot;is nodifferentiation in the way a contract is administered between companies in which theGovernment has a major shareholding or otherinterest or involvement, and companies in which its interest is limited to the contract./Thus ..-9-
Thus if Shorts were considered to have made an excessive profit under a government order, thecase would he referred to the contracts reviewhoard even though Shorts is 70 per cent owned by the Government and most of any profit would come back to the Government by another channel.Similarly there is a standard procedure tosafeguard the Governmenfs interests and assetsas far as possible which is applied when any company with a government contract, whether the Governmenthas shares in it or not, goes into liquidation,,(b) there are now very few companies whose business with the Government forms a majority of theirturnovero    The only important one is Westlands,where the Government1s business is perhaps alittle over half the total; with other largesuppliers like B.A.C., Shorts, Plessey, and Marconi,the Governmenfs orders constitute well underhalf the turnover.    This is a change from theposition at times in the past when the Governmentwas responsible for a very large proportion ofthe turnover of some companieso(c) there have been cases in t*e past where a company, a major part of whose turnover wastaken by the Government, went into liquidationand there was no claim that the Governmentshould be responsible for its debts; on thecontrary the Government sought to recover all itcould in respect of its own rights under its contracts./The oo-10-
The conclusion seems to he that the existence of majorGovernment contracts with a company which goes into liquidation is not in itself likely to give rise to claims against the Government by third parties.Where the Government is involved in a company boththrough government contract and in other ways, anyindirect responsibility for the debts of the companyon liquidation would flow from the other involvementand not the contract; the contracts would be unlikely to affect the position,15,   We have also considered whether, if the Governmenthas been involved with a company which is forced into liquidation, the Government could be held responsiblefor meeting claims for breach of contracts made by thecompany with otherso   Such claims rank for settlement on disposal of the assets with any other non-preferentialliabilities of the company.,    If there are nocomplications it seems unlikely that the Governmentwould be held to have any wider responsibility-However if there are complications, as for instance ifthe Government had involved itself to the extent ofguaranteeing the contracts, its position might beless free from doubt,IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC COLORATIONS16,   The first relevant category are bodies like IRCand NRDC, set up mainly to channel public funds into industry.       These bodies - both subscribe for shares(though not usually 100% or even majority holdings)and make loans to companies.   However they are by statute separated from the Government and make theirassessments independently.   Their operations are unlikely to be rescue operations such as those whichpresent most difficulty for the Government,   So/long -,
long as Government does not allow itself to becomeso closely identified with the detailed operations and decisions of these corporations as to be regardedas responsible for them, there is no reason to suppose that acceptance by Government of liability forBeagle&apos;s debts would affect the treatment expected from 1958-59 or NRDC if a company in which they heldan interest went into liquidations     But if,exceptionally, these bodies themselves become involvedin a situation where, under reputable commercialpractice, they considered it right to meet the debts of a company beyond their direct involvement,the cost in the last   resort would fall on public funds.17.   ^e Beagle decision is also unlikely to create difficulties in the case of the nationalised industries.    They, too, operate under conditions laid down by statute.    They are trading organisations.It is inconceivable that the Government would allowcircumstances to arise in which they were unable to meet their creditors: its credit is to that extentcommitted already.   The issue arises more directlyin relation to attitude of the nationalised industriestc   their subsidiaries.       In this they could beexpected to follow reputable practice in theprivate sector.   They would not need to have regardto the special circumstances which often surrounddirect Government intervention in industry because etheir acquisitions are made for commercial reasons andjudged accordingly by the trading interests affected.But even here the issue might not be clearcut as, forexample, in circumstances where a nationalised indusrty was known or believed to have acquired or set up a subsidiary in response to Government pressure in circumstances which created a presumption thatGovernment credit was committed by way of the industry.This is not, under present policies, a likely casebut it needs watching./SUMMARY oo-12-
SUMMARY OF EXISTING CASES WHERE A QUESTION OF LIABILITYMIGHT ARISE18,   A list of direct Government shareholdings isattached.   Apart from Beagle there are no companieswholly owned by the Government which seem likely to cause concern.   Much the most difficult cases areShorts and Upper Clyde Shipbuilders referred to inparagraph 9, and Cammell Laird if assistance is givenvia the SIB and 1958-59 as proposed.    It is much less likely that the Government would be expected to honourthe debts of ICL if that company became insolvent,but the statements made by the Government in supportof the company, and the Government&apos;s involvementthrough support of research and through preference toICL in the purchase of computers by the public sector,would have to be taken into account in a finalassessment; the Government would of course be legally liable to pay up the balance of 18/- on eachshare it holds at a cost of  3-15M,   There remains the possibility of exceptional cases arising out ofassistance under the Local Employment Acts and of others, again exceptionally, arising out of assistance given by outside bodies like 1958-59 and NRDC or the nationalised industries where the Government hasidentified itself with the support of a company in financial difficulties,GENERAL19o   This paper has been concerned to set out what seemsa reasonable interpretation of the implications of theBeagle decision.   Clearly there can be no cut and driedformula in a matter such as this and it is impossibleto anticipate what implications others might seek to attach to the Beagle decision if it suited them or what additional pressures might be applied to the/Government-13-
Government as a result.   Ministers are shown to he ina dilemma.    They may want to intervene in companies which are in financial difficulties for reasons of public policy, using the company structure to give themselves the maximum flexibility.   But there is no parallel in company practice for this situation and company lawis not designed to deal with it.    The consequence ofGovernment intervention may be to plunge thecompany deeper into insolvency and to lay theGovernment open to a wide liability for the company&apos;sdebts.    This indicates that the Government needs to keep clearly in mind, when .it intervenes orparticipates in non-Governmental enterprises, thekind and degree of liability it is taking upon itself in the circumstances in which it is acting.    Insome cases it might be possible for the Governmentto limit its contingent liability by a public statement at the time of intervention in the company; more often this could not be done without defeating thepurpose of the intervention as, for instance,&apos; whenrestoration of confidence is a major issue andobjective.20.    The Government&apos;s difficulties do not cease here.For if it seeks to safeguard its position by tighterand more rigorous control over companies which it hasacquired or in which it has taken a major interest,it becomes yet more involved and is likely to layitself open to a legal or quasi-legal liability; andit also runs the risk of weakening the enterprise andpossibly the chances of success of the management./On . o-14-
On the other hand if it seeks to avoid involvementby keeping no check, the company&apos;s financial position may &quot;become even more serious and the Government may still he held to have a moral liability for its debts.In general it may be necessary for the future to insist on greater control and on absolutely up-to-date information on debt obligations and the company&apos;disability to meet them.    In particular, where theGovernment intervenes to &quot;rescue&quot; a company whether on first intervention or at a later stage in its dealings,it should bear in mind that there is a strong likelihood that it will be held at least morally liable for the debts of the company hcwever much it seeks to avoidinvolvement in the management of the company&apos;s affairs.In the circumstances it seems better to keep a closecheck on the financial position of the company from the beginning, thereby risking a legal or quasi-legal liability, rather than stand back and allow an even more serious situation to develop.    This is thepolicy of the 1958-59 in those exceptional cases whereit has become involved in a rescue situation.    Itimposes firm plans for extricating the company andkeeps a close check on progress.21.    Oar conclusions from this survey of implications of the Beagle decision are as follows:-(a)   The most important factor affectingthe Governmenfs indirect or moral liability as distinct from its legal liability is the extentto which the Government1s activities may have created a legitimate assumption that it stands behind the company.    The entirecircumstances of the Governmenfs involvementrather than the particular form of its interest,are the crucial issue./(h) ..-15-
(b) Subject to this, the size and kind ofinterest held by the Government are certainlyimportantL    The fact of a 100% governmentshareholding is the circumstance most likely to giverise to the assumption that the Government standsbehind the company-   With smaller shareholdings,or different forms of interests, the Government&apos;smoral liability may be less, dependent always on theextent and nature of its involvement (e.g.Shorts and UCS).(c) It is unlikely that the Government would beexpected to stand, behind companies in which apublic corporation rather than the government itself had a shareholding, provided always thatthe Government had not allowed itself to becomeidentified with particular decisions to thepoint of being held responsible for them.This does not mean that the Corporationsthemselves would not consider it right to acceptliability in certain circumstances, withconsequences for public expenditure,(d) The Government needs to keep clearly inmind in intervening or participating in non-governmental enterprises the degree of liabilityit may in practice be talcing upon itself and to be particularly watchful about the circumstances of its initial involvement, the means it adopts of securingthe payment of loans or protecting it.- &quot; investmentsand its public attitude then   ancl thereafter.Ministry of Technology28th April, 1970.

CONFIDENTIALBEAGLE     AIRCRAFT     LIMITEDOPINION OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ANDMRo Jo P. F. Eo WARNERWe are asked to advise upon the following questions arising in connection with the affairs of Beagle AircraftLimited :-1o   whether the directors of the company might be liablein civil or criminal proceedings, the materialprovisions of the Companies Act 1948 being sections330 and 332;2o   whether any implied commitments for Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment arose from the directors&apos; actions;3c   whether the Minister of Technology could be the subjectof criticism in a creditor&apos;s action against the minister or in the course of a winding up;    and4o   generally, as to the principles that should guide theMinistry in other similar cases.2.    Section 330 of the Companies Act 1948 provides:-&quot;If any person, being at the time of the commission of the alleged offence an officer of a company which issubsequently ordered to be wound up by the court orsubsequently passes a resolution for voluntary winding up, -(a) has by false pretences or by means of any other fraudinduced any person to give credit to the company;(b) with intent to defraud creditors of the company, hasmade or caused to be made any gift or transfer of or charge on, or has caused or connived at the levying of any executionagainst, the property of the company;(c) with intent to defraud creditors&apos; of the company, hasconcealed or removed any part of the property of the companysince, or within two months before, the date of anyunsatisfied judgment or order for payment of money obtainedagainst the company;   he shall be guilty of a misdemeanour. /and shall
and shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term notexceeding twelve monthsThere is no evidence before us to suggest that the directorsare guilty of offences against that section,3,    Subsections (1) and (3) of section 332 of that Act provide:-(1)   &quot;If in the course of the winding up of a company itappears that any business of the company has beencarried on with intent to defraud creditors of thecompany or crditors of any other person or for anyfraudulent purpose, the court, on the application ofthe official receiver, or the liquidator or anycreditor or contributory of the company, nay, if itthinks proper so to do, declare that any persons who- were knowingly parties to the carrying on of thebusiness in manner aforesaid shall be personallyresponsible, without any limitation of liability, forall or any of the debts or other liabilities of thecompany as the court may direct,&quot;(3) &quot;Where any business of a company is carried on with suchintent or for such purpose as is mentioned in subsection (1) of this section, every person who wasknowingly   a party to the carrying on of the business in manner aforesaid, shall be liable on convictionon indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to a fine not exceeding give hundred pounds or to both,,&quot;4-o     In our opinion the position of the directors in relationto section 332 cannot be considered independently of that ofthe Ministry,   Liability under section 332 both civil and criminal, extends to any person who is &quot;knowingly a party&quot; tothe carrying on of the business of the company &quot;with intent to defraud creditors&quot;.    Such liability is not confined toofficers of the company; it extends, in our opinion, to anyperson who is party to the offence.    It is true that the/section- 2 -
section does not apply to the Crown, but this would not inour opinion justify the Crown in doing that which, if done byanyone else, would be an offence under the section.5.    The word &quot;defraud&quot; in the section connotes &quot;actualdishonesty involving, according to current notions of fairtrading among commercial men, real moral blame&quot;, so that, if a company continues to carry on business and to incur debts ata time when there is to the knowledge of those responsiblefor its affairs &quot;no reasonable prospect&quot; of the creditors everreceiving payment of those debts, it is, in general, &quot;a properinference&quot; that the business of the company is being carriedon &quot;with intent to defraud&quot; those creditors - (per Maugham J.Ea William C. Leitch Brothers Ltd. 1932 Ch. 71, 77 and inEe Patrick and Lyon Ltd 1933 Ch. 786, 790)6.    In the present case, we understand that the Ministry hadno reason to doubt the company&apos;s solvency before October 1969o   Wehave before us the minutes of a meeting held on 21st June 1968.This meeting appears to have been concerned primarily with the size and purpose of the Government&apos;s investment in the company,&quot;but the directors were warned during the course of it againstundertaking a development programme which would render thecompany insolvent.    The Ministry&apos;s position was merely that ofshareholder and creditor and it was under no duty (at all eventsto the other creditors) to keep itself informed as to the company&apos;ssolvency.   There can therefore, in our opinion, be no criticism of the Ministry&apos;s conduct during this period.7.     In October 1969 however the Ministry were made aware thatthe company was insolvent, at all events unless the government loans were treated as if they were share capital.   With this knowledge, the Ministry, for six weeks, provided the company with cash for the express and limited purpose of enabling it tocontinue trading without incurring a compulsory liquidation atthe instance of the creditors.    This would have been indefensiblehad it not been for the Minister&apos;s intention (evidenced, forexample, in his letter to the Chief Secretary of 24th November1969) to make available such funds as might eventually bez /necessary
necessary to pay the creditors - for it is not suggested that theMinistry expected the company to become solvent as a result ofsuch continued trading, or otherwise.    It was, we understand,the Ministry&apos;s hope that, if the company continued to trade,it would be able to sell its business as a going concern and thereby realise more from it than it otherwise would;   but theexistence of such a hope would not, of itself, be an adequateanswer to a charge of fraudulent trading.8.    It is against that background that the position of the directors in relation to section 332 must be considered.   Asregards the period before October 1969, it may well be that their belief that the Government loans could be treated as if they wereshare capital was misplaced.   But there is no reason to doubt itsgenuineness.    As regards the later period the directors were entitled to assume (despite the formal situation and despite thevarious disclaimers by officials in the Ministry of personalauthority to commit the Government) that the Government would infact see the creditors paid, because otherwise, as we have pointed out, the Government&apos;s own actions would have beenindefensible.   We do not suggest that the directors necessarilyexamined section 332 and reasoned as we have done.   But theywere able to reach the same conclusion by reference to &quot;currentnotions of fair trading among commercial men&quot;.   Moreover,that it was the correct conclusion was confirmed to them by what was said &quot;by the Paymaster General at the meeting heldon 13th October 1969-   The subsequent correspondence showsthat it was in fact the conclusion that they reached.    Inthese circumstances we do not think that the directors could he held liable under section 332.9.     By the same token we are of opinion that, as a practicalmatter, the Government cannot now disclaim liability to the creditors of the company.   Whether in fact the directors had authority express or ostensible to pledge the Government&apos;s credit and whether, if so, they did pledge it, seems to us immaterial.The crux is that the Government could now resist the claims of/creditors- 4 -
creditors only by asserting in effect (and In disregard of theMinister&apos;s intention) that it had chosen to adopt a course which,if adopted by anyone else, would have rendered them liable,in a winding up of. the company, for   fraudulent trading.10.   We are ashed to advise generally as to the principlesthat should guide the Ministry in other similar cases.    In ouropinion, the fundamental principle is that the Ministry should never knowingly be a party to an insolvent company continuing to carry on business unless either (a)   there is a reasonable prospect that by doing so, or by some other means, it willbecome solvent again or (b) the Ministry is satisfied that suchfunds as. may be needed to pay the creditors will be available from its own resources or otherwise.    One solution, where it is desired to give Government assistance for the carrying on ofa business that is owned by an insolvent company, will be to forma new company to buy the business free from the liabilities ofthe old company, ensuring that the new company&apos;s share capitalis sufficient to give it a reasonalbe prospect of remainingsolvent.   The special circumstances of particular   cases maysuggest other solutions, e.g. a scheme of arrangement vundersection 206 of the Act.I6th February 1970Law Officers&apos; DepartmentRoyal Courts of Justice- 5 -
