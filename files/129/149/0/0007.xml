GO^DENTIALjOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVI2RNLIENTCOPY NO g 3PURCHASE OF TEN-TON TRUCKS FOR THE army memorandum by the President of the Eoard of trade. At the Cabinet meeting on 26 March (CC(70) 14th Conclusions,Minute 6) I was invited to consider whether the Volvo truck was being offered at a &quot;dumping&quot; price.2. In our anti-dumping legislation &quot;dumping&quot; is defined as sellingfor export at a price lower than that of comparable sales in the exportershome market.    According to information the Ministry of Defence havereceived from the Commercial Counsellor in Stockholm the list priceof the Volvo truck in Sweden is  8,200.    This, however, is not a&quot;comparable&quot; price.    The Ministry of Defence normally expect toget a 20 per cent discount on any purchase they make, and a largerdiscount on large orders,    A 25 per cent discount would bring theprice down to  6,150,     This is higher than the price  5,524 whichVolvo have quoted.    The margin is, however, not such as to suggestthat there is any very considerable element of dumping.3. It follows from v/hat I have said that the question of anti-dumpinreaction scarcely arises.    To complete the picture, however, it may be worth adding that:i,       Cur legislation provides, in accordance with GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) requirements, thatanti-dumping duties can be imposed on a GATT country only if the effect of the dumping is such as to cause or threatenmaterial injury to a British industry.    For the dumping to cause any injury the first essential is that the overseas exportershould have obtained the business because he quoted a dumpedprice.    If he would have obtained the business at an undumpeuprice the dumping would not be the cause of the loss suffered bythe British industry.    In this case, it is clear from the estimatedannual costs quoted in the Annex to SEP(70) 33 that Volvo could have substantially increased their price - certainly sufficiently to eliminate any margin of dumping there might be - and still have obtained the order.C(70) 476 April 1970CABINET
ii. The immediate injury to the industry would be the loss of thepresent contract, which Lord Stokes has himself described as&quot;relatively insignificant&quot;.    What worries the industry is a long-term threat arising from a loss of reputation.    This would bedifficult to quantify and it would be difficult to show, as we arerequired to do under the terms of the Anti-Dumping Code of which both we and Sweden are signatories, that this aspect constituted a&quot;clear and imminent threat&quot; of material injury.iii. The Board of Trade would not normally investigate anallegation of dumping unless and until they received an applicationfrom the industry supported by prirna facie evidence of dumping andmaterial injury caused or threatened thereby.R.M.Board of Trade S&apos;,713 April 1970
