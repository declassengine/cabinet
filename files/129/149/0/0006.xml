J, C,Home Office, S..W.1.19th March, 1970
ANNEXText of a letter dated 19th March 1970 from the Home Secretaryto the Secretary of the Police FederationI was glad to have the opportunity of discussing recently with you andMr. &amp;ale the important question of the protection of police officers againstviolence, and, in, particular, the question of the penalty for the murder ofa police officer, in the light of Parliaments recent decision to makepermanent the abolition of the death penalty.The need to give the police all possible support and protection intheir fight against crime, and violent crime in particular, is one of mymain concerns.     The most effective deterrent, I believe, is the certainty of detection, and that is why it is important to increase police strengthstill further and provide forces with the equipment and facilities whichthey need.     At the same time, detection by itself is not enough andespecially in the case of so grave a crime as the murder of a policeman,the penalty must be seen to be commensurate ?rith the heinousness of the offence, and must serve as a deterrent to criminals and a protection tothe police and law-abiding citizens generally.The sentence for murder is now life imprisonment and I should liketo explain, in some detail, the procedure and safeguards under which lifesentence oases are treated and reviewed.First, the sentencing stage.     The only sentence that can be passedfor murder is life imprisonment, but the trial judge is expressly empoweredby the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 19^5 to recommend a minimum period for which the murderer should be detained in prison.     Such a recommendation is&apos; not necessarily made in every case and although wheremade it is not binding on the Home Secretary or the Parole Board, nevertheless,it will clearly be a most important consideration to be taken into account in considering the prisoner&apos;s eventual release.    In the case of the three menconvicted in 1966 of the murder of Detective Sergeant Tippet-Head,Detective Constable Wombwell and Police Constable Cox at Shepherd&apos;3 Bush,the judge recommended a minimum period of detention of 30 years.-1
Next, as to the review of cases.     There is a difference here betweenthe fixed sentence and the life sentence.The person sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment has for a longtime been able to earn the remission of one-third of the sentence by good conduct (so that a sentence of say 15 years has normally meant actualdetention for 10 years).     Under the parole scheme every prisoner serving(in effect) a fixed sentence of imprisonment of over 18 months is eligiblefor consideration for parole when he has served one-third of his sentence,or 12 months, whichever is the longer.     He is entitled to have his casereviewed, in the first instance, by a local review committee at the prisonin which he is detained, and if they recommend favourably, by the centralParole Board.The life sentence prisoner, however, has no entitlement to have his casereviewed by the local committee at any particular time.     Normally, the firstreview by the local committee takes place after seven years.     But a reviewafter seven years does not in any way imply that the Home Secretary considersthat the time has come to oontemplate giving the prisoner a provisional dateof release.     It is arranged at about this stage of the prisoner&apos;s sentenceso that he himself is aware that his case is subject to review by an outsidebody, and so that those cases in which there are mitigating circumstances which might justify release after say nine or ten years will be brought to notice.     Except where a provisional date of release is fixed as a result ofthis first review, the prisoner&apos;s case will be considered again by the localreview committee at suitable intervals.The local review committee are concerned primarily with the questionwhether or not the prisoner could, in their view, be safely released, and do not take into account some of the wider considerations; and if they makea favourable recommendation, it is not binding on the Parole Board, or onthe Home Secretary. The Home Secretary cannot release any life sentenceprisoner on licence unless recommended to do so by the Parole Board, which includes three High Court judges.-2-CONF1DENT1AL
Where a life sentence prisoner is being considered for release, the law; requires that, before a decision is taken, the Lord Chief Justice andthe trial judge, if the latter is available, must be consulted, and I can assure you that their views carry great weight with me and with the ParoleBoard.     The Home Secretary is not obliged to accept a recommendation bythe Parole Board for release, and I should make clear that every case of proposed release is studied by me personally.The present law, therefore, and the procedures under it, provide animpressive defence against the possibility of premature or ill-consideredrelease of a person serving a life sentence - not that I think that this danger has existed in practice.     Some people, I know, are still under theimpression that any life sentence prisoner can expect to be released afternine years,     I cannot emphasise too strongly that this impression is wrong.The facts speak for themselves.     There are at present 66 life sentenceprisoners in prison who have already been detained for nine years orlonger - the longest for over 20 years.Under the procedure which I have outlined, full weight is given to the degree of gravity of the offence, as well as to considerations of public safety, at all stages of a life sentence and its review.     I would certainlyregard as exceptionally serious the case of a person who had been convicted of the murder of a police officer or of a prison officer.     No one convicted of a crime of this kind should expect that he will be released merely because a certain number of years, however many they may be, have elapsed.     there could be cases where the protection of the public required that the sentence should be literally one for life.Another important safeguard is that a life sentence prisoner releasedon licence is subject to conditions of supervision for as long as necessary;and for the rest of his life he remains liable to recall to prison at anytime.     I have not hesitated to exercise the power of recall whenever it seemed necessary to do so for the protection of the public or of anyparticular members of the public.-3-CONFIDENTIAL
A life sentence is, therefore, no empty formula or soft option.     ButI recognise that there is a case, in the light of and subject to Parliamentdecision to abolish the death penalty, for considering whether the lifesentence should remain the only sentence which can he imposed for murder.As I have announced in the House of Commons, I am asking the Criminal law revision Committee, whose chairman is Lord Justice Edmund Davies, to review the whole law of offences against the person, including homicide, and thiswill include a review of the penalties.     The committee will, therefore, heahle to consider whether there should be any re-definition of the offenceof murder and (subject to Parliament&apos;s recent decision on the abolition ofthe death penalty) whether there should be any change in the penalty for murder - for instance, whether the courts should be able to pass a sentencefor a fixed term of years instead of, as now, being obliged to pass anindeterminate life sentence.     The committee will begin their review by seeking the views of those primarily concerned with the administration and enforcement of the criminal law, and there will, therefore, be full opportunity for police officers, and prison officers, through their representative bodies, to put their views to Lord Justice Edmund Daviesand his colleagues.-4-
