:HIG DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C(70) 424th March. 1970COPY NO.     U tlCABINETRABIESMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, fisheries and FoodMy colleagues will have seen that there has been another case ofrabies in a dog.    I gave the facts in a Parliamentary answer on 3rd Marchand a copy is attached.2.      There is no connection between this case and the cases at Folkestoneand Camberley last year.    This is satisfactory so far.    Nonetheless, this case underlines that there is much that we do not know about this terribledisease, which is rapidly increasing in Europe.    I believe, therefore, thatit would be wise to have a high level enquiry into our defences against rabies.The enquiry would cover both policy and administration, and I have in mind that it might be chaired by a leading QueenTs Counsel.     We have so farkept rabies out of this country.    No country which has allowed it to infectits wildlife population has ever succeeded in eradicating it.    We must make sure that we have the best advice so that we are in a position to preserve our freedom from the disease.3.      The sort of questions which the enquiry would consider are -(i) Length of quarantine.    This latest case appears to have incubatedthe disease for nine months.(ii) The effectiveness of vaccination.    This dog had been vaccinated in pakistan but still died of the disease, apparently demonstrating thefallibility of vaccination.(iii) The quarantine arrangements.   Further enquiries by investigatingofficers have turned up evidence of a number of breaches of therules at the kennels in Folkestone which make the possibility ofcross infection in last yearts cases more likely.    Subject to any representations, therefore, I have decided that I should revoke thelicence of the owners of these kennels.    But I think that the wholequestion of our quarantine arrangements should be looked at by thehigh level enquiry,-1-CONF1DENT8AL
4.      For all these reasons I hope that my colleagues will support the setting up of an enquiry and an early announcement,5.      I am also considering whether, in advance of the enquiry, it wouldbe right to extend quarantine or ban the import of dogs and cats from allcountries not free of the disease.C.H.Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, S. W. L3rd March, 1970-2-CONFIDENTIAL
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and FoodTuesday, 3rd March, 1970Unstarred Question No. 37Mr. Francis Pym (Unionist - Cambridgeshire): Asked the Minister ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food, what action he is taking following the case of rabies in a dog at Newmarket; and if he will make astatement,Mr. Cledwyn Hughes: The dog Sessanhad been under close veterinarysurveillance and died on 27th February from &quot;dumb&quot; rabies.    This is a form of rabies in which the animal is not aggressive during the short period when it is infective.    The Medical Officer of Health for the area has been kept fully informed from the outset and has taken all measures needed tosafeguard human health.Sessan, with another dog in the same ownership, had been imported from Pakistan on 30th May, 1969 and both were released from scheduledquarantine in Essex on 30th November, 1969.    The second dog remainedhealthy but has now been put down.    There is no connection with the caseslast year at Camberley and Folkestone.My veterinary staff, assisted by the police, have been makingexhaustive enquiries to trace any other possible contacts during the shortdanger period when the dog was infective and might have transmitted the disease.    None has come to light.    As a precaution, however, a dog whichwas bitten by Gossan on 18th January, i. e. before onset of the disease, isbeing taken into quarantine custody.    My veterinary advice is that anotherdog, which might have had contact with Sessan some six weeks before shedied is not at risk.    Enquiries have extended to an area in North Londonwhich the owner visited with Sessan shortly before the onset of the disease.But there was no known contact there.Special enquiries have been made on any possible risk to horses inthe Newmarket area.    The exercising arrangements for horses and forSessan left no scope for any form of contact or for transmission of virus.There is, therefore, no reason for any restrictions in that sector.    Nor havethe veterinary and other enquiries revealed any possibility of contact withwildlife.    Sessan was on a leash on the sole occasion that she was exercisedwhile showing signs of illness.There has been no case of rabies in the quarantine premises atPurleigh, Essex since June, 1968,   However, to facilitate furtherinvestigations, which are still in progress, no quarantined animals arebeing released from these premises for the time being.CONFIDENTIAL
