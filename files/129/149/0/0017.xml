OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYhS government(70) 57 COPY NO   &quot; ^4th May 1970CABINETPROPOSED NEW POWER FOR THE COMMISSION FOR INDUSTRY and manpower. BILL. TO CONTROL EXPENDITURE ON ADVERTISINGAND SALES PROMOTIONMemorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretary ofState for Employment and ProductivityINTRODUCTORY1, We have been discussing in the Ministerial Committee on industrial Policy a proposal I have made that we should seek to include in the Commission for Industry and Manpower (CIM) Bill at committee stage a power which would enable Ministers to control the level ofexpenditure by companies on advertising and sales promotion, following a report by the Commission which found that levels of such expenditure were excessively high and against the public interest.2. The Committee were generally in favour of the Governmentspossessing such a statutory power but it was agreed that, in view ofthe political implications of seeking such a power at the present time,the decision as to whether the CIM Bill should be amended in this wayshould be left to Cabinet.THE CASE FOR THE NEW power, There is no power in the present monopolies and mergerslegislation, nor in the CIM Bill, which enables Ministers to restrictadvertising and sales promotion expenses of manufactures by Order.4. The basic case for taking such a power is that v/e expect thatthe CIM will find from time to time that levels of advertising andpromotional expenditure in industries which it investigates are excessiveand contrary to the public interest.    If Departments are effectively tofollow up such findings we need to be armed with powers to make Ordersregulating advertising and sales promotion expenditure.
5. One of the characteristics of duopoly and oligopoly situations whichthe CIM will be investigating, especially in industries producing consumer goods-, and one of the typical manifestations of market power in conditionsof imperfect competition, is high levels of expenditure on advertising and sales promotion.    In these market situations, as the monopolies commission found in the case of detergents, price competition tends to be limited or non-existent and is generally replaced by competition in advertising and promotion.    The main aim of this advertising is notto inform the consumer but is directed at maintaining and increasing themarket power of the company concerned, particularly against smallercompanies who cannot afford such levels of expenditure.    Potentialcompetitors who might otherwise enter the market and provide a safeguard against excessive profits are deterred by the high level of expenditure onadvertising and sales promotion which is required in order to break intothe market, and so the market power of the heavy advertisers tends toremain unchallenged.6. There has been ample demonstration of this in reports of the monopolies Commission and the National Board for Prices and Incomes(NBPI).    In their report on household detergents in 1966, the monopolies commission found that the policies of Unilever and Procter and Gamblewere against the public interest in that they tended to keep out new entrants,resulted in over-concentration of competition on advertising and salespromotion to the detriment of effective price competition, and in undulyhigh profits and unnecessarily high prices to the public.    The Commissionrecommended a 40 per cent reduction in the selling expenses of thecompanies.    Because of the gap in our powers, we were not able to achieve this.    Although there was a significant fall in 1967 and 1968,compared with 1966, advertising on household detergents reverted in1969 to levels even higher than those before the Commission^ report,7, Much the same position is shown by reports of the NBPI onconfectionery and cosmetics;  selling costs on toiletries and cosmeticsaccounted for 50 per cent of manufacturers&apos; prices, and had risen by50 per cent in 1965-69.    Attempts to bring about a reduction in sellingexpenses indirectly by price control are subject to serious shortcomingsand disadvantages, not the least being that they inevitably tend to hurtmost the smaller and weaker firms and not the powerful firms relying on heavy advertising as an aggressive technique.    Experience showsthat there is no real alternative to the direct approach.8,        The President of the Board of Trade has argued that we shouldnot take the power before the completion of a research study on advertisingby Professor Cowling of the University of Warwick which he is about to launch.    But this enquiry was announced as long ago as April 1967,following the Monopolies Commission^ Report on Household Detergents;it is not yet under way and is not expected to be completed until^the summer of 1972 at the earliest.    It seems to me that it would be unfortunate to miss the opportunity which the CIM Bill provides to
CONFIDENTLYtake power to deal with this problem because of a research study which is hardly likely to cast doubt on the need to have such a pov/er.    The studymight well be useful in providing a theoretical framework and perhaps inidentifying situations in which the public interest requires a restriction onadvertising and sales promotion activities, but even without a theoreticalframework we know that such situations exist and we now have the rightBill in which to take a general power of control.    Moreover I am proposingat this stage only that we should be armed with this pov/er.    The study ismore relevant to its future use,9.        Some Ministers were concerned about the effects of the proposed new pov/er on the advertising revenues of the communications media.    I donot think this need deter us.    The power will be used only rarely and wouldbe confined to specified and limited reductions in the advertising and/orsales promotion expenditure of specified companies which had been investigated by the CIM so that Its Impact on the revenues of televisioncompanies or newspapers would be negligible.    For example, if we hadbeen even more drastic than the Monopolies Commission recommended,and required the detergent manufacturers to halve their advertisingexpenditure, this would have reduced ITV advertising revenue by only  or 3 per cent, and would have affected newspapers hardly at all.    but even if it were to have any impact I could not accept that we should ignorean abuse of market power disclosed by a CIM report merely to ensure thatthe communications media did not lose any advertising revenue.PROPOSED ACTION10.       The Ministerial Committee on Industrial Policy generally favour andI strongly recommend to my colleagues the proposal that at committee stage of the CIM Bill we should add a new power enabling Ministers tocontrol the level of expenditure by companies on advertising and salespromotion following a report by the CIM which finds that such expenditure is excessive and against the public interest.    I would propose that thereshould be an amendment to give Ministers a power to make an Orderlimiting the amount of such kinds of expenditure as may be specified in theOrder,    The precise definition of such expenditure in any specific case would be clear from the report by the CIM which criticised aspects of the advertising and sales promotion expenditure of the companies it hadinvestigated.11.        We shall undoubtedly face vigorous opposition In Parliament, fromthe Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and advertising interests onthis proposal,    I believe, however, that the political consequences wouldbe by no means entirely unfavourable and that we could expect a good dealof support for this proposal from outside the vested interests immediatelyaffected.    There might be advantage in being seen to have consulted theinterests concerned before tabling the proposed amendment, and this might also give us the opportunity of assessing public opinion.    One way of3
achieving this would be to encourage a Government back-bench member to table an amendment in Committee which I would undertake to consider.The proposal would then be the subject of consultation with the CBI andadvertising interests before we tabled a Government amendment.    But i hope v/e should not be dissuaded from our purpose by the inevitableopposition of vested interests.12.       I believe that the proposal I am now making will fill an importantgap in our competition policy and I hope Cabinet will agree that we shouldtake this power in the CIM Bill.B A department of Employment and Productivity SW14 May 1970I4
