GENERAL ELECTION: REPLIES TO ENQUIRIES1. It is desirable that all Departments should, so far as possible,follow a common procedure in dealing with enquiries or requests forinformation, particularly by Parliamentary candidates, during theElection campaign,2.        Departments should provide any Parliamentary candidate withfactual information which is readily available and is not confidential.    such information should not, however, be provided if its extraction would require a substantial use of official time; a useful criterion is whether information would be extracted for the purpose of a reply to a Parliamentary Question.Local and regional offices should deal on this basis with any enquiriesaddressed to them; but they should refer doubtful cases to the headquarters of their Department fcr decision.3,        For information not of a factual nature, or for guidance on policy,Labour candidates and their agents are expected to look to Transport House.In order to prevent much separate and unco-ordinated correspondence between Transport House and individual Government Departments, theElection Business Committee of the Cabinet has been appointed to supervise the work of advising Government candidates about the replies which theyshould return to questionnaires and other enquiries put to them during the campaign,    Transport House will accordingly collate questionnaires or particular questions which they receive, and normally will prepare firstdrafts of replies.    All drafts will be forwarded to the Minister without portfolio who will in appropriate cases obtain, through the ElectionBusiness Committee, the comments of the Ministers concerned upon themin order to check the information and arguments originally supplied byTransport House.    The Secretary of the Committee will, where this seemsnecessary in the light of a Ministers comments or the comments ofTransport House, submit final drafts of replies for the Committee&apos;approval.    Transport House will thereafter be responsible for passing onthe necessary guidance to candidates.4.        Requests for information not of a factual nature, or policy enquiriesfrom Labour candidates, which are addressed to Departments should normally be referred, through ministers Private Offices, to the minister without Portfolio, accompanied, Inappropriate cases, by advice from theMinisters on how such enquiries should be answered and on the questionwhether they are of such a nature as to require consideration by theElection Business Committee.   A copy of any such communication shouldbe sent to the Secretary of the Election Business Committee at the cabinet office.5.        Requests for information not of a factual nature, or policy enquiries which are addressed to Departments by individual members of the public,are usually answered by or on behalf of the responsible Ministers.    Duringthe Election campaign this procedure is still correct, but Ministers should arrange for copies of the correspondence to be sent to both Transport house and the Secretary of the Election Business Committee,1
6.        Enquiries addressed to Departments from any quarter may call foran important statement of policy to be made by the Minister concerned.In that event a Minister may decide himself to seek the guidance of theElection Business Committeej and In any case it would be advisable toinform the Secretary of the Committee of the enquiry and of the terms ofthe reply.7.        The function of initiating guidance to Labour candidates in caseswhere no issue of policy is concerned normally belongs to Transport House.Exceptionally, Ministers may wish to suggest topics on which guidanceshould be given.    In these instances, suggestions should be sent to transport House who will prepare first drafts and forward them to theMinister without Portfolio, who will arrange for them to be considered,as necessary, by fhe Election Business Committee.8,        Replies sent after the Dissolution to letters received from Membersof Parliament before the Dissolution and replies to letters received fromParliamentary candidates after the Dissolution which constitute&quot;constituency case&quot; letters should take into account the fact that duringthe Election period letters to candidates may well become public knowledge and be the subject of political comment,    It is desirable to avoid any suggestion that the Government machine is engaging in Party politics or being used for Party purposes.    Such letters should therefore be handledwith particular care and whenever possible under Ministerial guidance.In some cases it may not be appropriate for Ministers to reply personally to letters from ex-Members about, for example, constituency cases, until after the Election result is known.    In cases where the facts do not permit of delay a reply should normally be sent at Private Secretary level.2
