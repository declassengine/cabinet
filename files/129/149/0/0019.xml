OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government(70) 59 COPY NO    C S6 May 1970CABINETLONDON TRANSPORT FARESMemorandum by the Minister of TransportINTRODUCTIONOn 30 April the London Transport Executive (LTE) announced thatthey were making an application to the Greater London Council (GLC) for increases in fares on London buses and tubes.    The increases were designed to come into effect in late summer/early autumn 1970, and tobring in some  14, 5 million in a full year.    The increases were considered on Tuesday 5 May by the GLC policy and resources committee; it agreedto recommend their approval to the Council.    A final decision isexpected to be taken by the GLC on Tuesday 12 May.DETAILS OF THE INCREASES2,        The main features of the increases ares-a. On the Underground, in central London there will be aminimum fare of Is, with the bulk of other fares going up by 6dto make a coarsened ls/2s/3s structure. Outside central London,the 6d minimum fare would be retained for journeys of half a mile,but prices generally would go up by 6d or Is.b. Bus fares.    In central London, the 6d, Is and Is 6d fares forone, two and three miles would remain unaltered.    Other fareswould go up by 6d.    In outer London, the 6d and Is fares would remain unaltered, and all other fares would go up by 6d.c. Red Arrow fares would be increased from 6d to 9d,d. Suburban flat fares generally would be increased from 6d to9d for adults;  3d to 6d for children.
e. There would be increases of up to 20 per cent for Undergroundseason tickets for distances over one mile.f. It is also proposed to increase the charges made to educationauthorities for travel by scholars aged 14 to 10.STATUTORY POSITION3.        Under the terms of the Transport (London) Act 1969, control ofLondon fares was removed from the independent Transport tribunal.    Fora short interim period before the handing over of London Transport tothe Greater London Council, approval for fares increases rested withthe Minister of Transport.    But with effect from 1 January 1970 statutoryresponsibility for London fares passed to the Greater London CouncilsThere is no requirement for Government approval to the increases and no government power of veto under the Act.POSITION UNDER PRTVES AND INCOMES LEGISLATION4.        Under Prices and Incomes Acts, as amended by the Transport(London) Act 1969, London Transport fares increases can be referred tothe National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI).    It seems very doubtful as a matter of law whether or not the standstill provisions ofSection 8 of the Prices and Incomes Act 1966 could be applied to london transport fares; and if an attempt were made to apply them the LTEwould probably challenge it in the courts.    And given that the new legislation will not contain standstill powers, I understand that it has notbeen thought appropriate to use existing powers in recent months even where there were no legal problems.5.        If a reference to the NBPI were to be made, it seems clear thatthis could not be until after the GLC had taken a final decision since it wouldappear to prejudge their decision.   At present, the matter is between theExecutive and the Council.COMMENT6.        There has not been an opportunity to assess in detail the financial circumstances that have prompted the LTE proposals.    They areequivalent to about a 14 per cent increase in fares revenue and almost certainly do no more than match the increased costs that the LTE arefacing primarily as a result of recent wages settlement.    The real issuefor the GLC is a policy one of whether or not fares in London should be subsidised from the rates.    This the present GLC have set their facesfirmly against.7, It has always been made clear that London Transport fares are subject to general prives and incomes policy, and a reference of theseproposals would indeed be a possibility.2
8.        On the other hand, there are risks in a reference to nbpi.    whatever the conclusions of NBPI, the Government has no means of enforcing them.Furthermore, it is doubtful whether the central policy issue - that of subsidy as against fares increases - is one on which NBPI can appropriately be asked to comment,    If this aspect is excluded, it is difficult to see how the NBPI can fail to endorse the proposals.9.        Finally, there is the point of presentation.    It seerns from public and Press comment to have been generally appreciated that these faresare a GLC responsibility.    Once the Government intervenes, theresponsibility for the increases is, in the public view, to some extenttransferred to the Government.   And given the GLC*s present attitude itseems unlikely that they would give effect to any criticisms of their proposals from NBPI.    Moreover, there have already been substantialfare increases outside London.   London Transport already enjoysassistance from the Exchequer through the capital write-off in last year&quot;sTransport (London) Act, and to hint at further special treatment now for london would not be popular in the provinces.CONCLUSION10.       The question of reference of these fares to NBPI is by no means a clear-cut one.    The final decision needs to be taken in the light of theterms of the eventual GLC decision, and public reaction to it.    Given this,I propose that we should not at this stage commit the Government to anNBPI reference; and, unless we are prepared so to commit theGovernment, it would be wiser to say nothing now.F W MMinistry of Transport SE16 May 19703
