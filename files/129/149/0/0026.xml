DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S government(70) 6626th May 1970CABINETPENSIONS INCREASE. A NEW system memorandum by the Lord Privy seal the Civil Service Department has for some time been working on changes in the system for increases in public service pensions.    Thismatter has been brought to a head by the election and the expected attitudeof the Opposition.2.     In the Second Reading debate on the last Pensions (Increase) Bill,the Opposition spokesman, Mr. Patrick Jenkin, committed the Oppositionto three new principles(a) To bring all pre-1956 pensions up to the level of thoseawarded in that year for people retiring in the same gradewith the same service.(b) To make pensions increase payable from the age of 55for all public servants with a retiring age before that agee, g. those in the Police or Armed Forces.(c) To institute a regular biennial review in line with thecost of living.(Official Report, 28th January, 1969, Cols. 1139-1140).Rather less specifically, the Opposition committed themselves to improving the present system of pensions increase in &quot;Putting Britain Right Ahead&quot;(October 1965) and &quot;Making Life Better&quot; (October 1968).3.     It is essential, therefore, that we must be able to state with afair degree of precision what our own policy is.    Labour Party policy on the subject was set out in a document published before the 1964General Election in the following terms&quot;While the Labour Government would not be able to accept&quot;parity&quot; in full or at once for financial reasons, it wouldbe prepared to give careful and sympathetic considerationto any proposal made. &quot;copy NO   6 3
We have already publicly rejected the traditional system and stated our intention &quot;to replace /it/ with something much better , ,, which guaranteesto the public service pensioner regular increases when he ought to havethem&quot;   (Mrs. Judith Hart, Official Report, 17th February, 1969,Cols. 137-138).    I must therefore ask my colleagues to consider whatthey may regard as a somewhat technical matter.4.     The defects of the present system are briefly theses-(a) Public service pensioners see their pensions continuallydeclining in value and have no assurance that they will beregularly reviewed,    By contrast, the National superannuation and Social Insurance Bill already commits us to biennial reviews of State benefits.(b) Under the present system, the real value of pensionsdeclines steadily for about 5-6 years and it is not restoreduntil between 10 and 12 years after retirement.(c) The present system is full of anomalies, e. g. some ofthe smaller pensions that date from the period 1959-64 arenow worth less than those that date from 1958,5.     It is therefore essential that we should make a fresh start.    Asto this.-(a) We must ensure that everyone enters the new system on equal terms.    This means restoring the real value of all pastpensions awarded before a convenient base date,    April 1969would be the most suitable.    This will be a once-for-allimprovement which I estimate will cost about  25-30 million in the first year of the new system which I recommend should start in April 1971.    This avoids the excessive cost of fullparity (at least  75 million).    The Opposition is not in anycase committed to this.)   33t also avoids the technical difficulties of any measure of partial parity on the lines of theOpposition proposal at 1(a) above.(b) We need a system under which pensions would beincreased at regular intervals.    I suggest biennial reviews in line with fe* $tn$a. $efeeme though not necessarily from the same date.    Increases ought not, in my view, to be related to increases in earnings, Le, a measure of parity.    In this respect,I think it fully justifiable to apply a stricter principle than that ofthe State scheme i. e. inflation-proofing to ensure only that public service pensions keep pace with rises in the cost of living.This greatly reduces the cost.    If the next review took place inApril 1971, two years after the operative date of the last Pensions(increase) Act, the annual cost, additional to that at (a) above,would be about  35 million.    Given the expected increases in2
the cost of living, we would in any case have been committed to a further Pensions (Increase) Act under the existing systemso this cannot be regarded as additional expenditure.It is accepted by the Treasury that neither (a) nor (b) is new expenditurein the PESC context because it would count as a normal pay and price increase.6.     I therefore ask my colleagues to agree that policy statementsshould include a commitment to adopt the new system described above.This will benefit pensioners from all the public, services e. g. the armed forces, the Civil Service, the Police and Fire Services, LocalGovernment, the National Health Service, Teachers, together with manysmaller groups such as ex-members of the Indian Civil Service orHM Overseas Civil Service.    I annex the draft of a possible announcement.7,     In two respects our proposals may look as if they fall short ofthose likely to be made by the Oppositions-(a) Partial parity up to, say, 1956, may look superficiallymore attractive than a once-for-all, inflation-proofedincrease as at, say April 1969.    But we can demonstrate that in cash terms our proposals are at least as good and avoid the anomalies inherent in partial parity.(b) We do not propose to alter the present practice wherebypensions increase does not apply below the age of 60 fore. g. the Armed Forces or the Police.    I do not think itjustifiable on social grounds to pay pensions increase to largegroups of pensioners who can reasonably be assumed to be capable of, and mostly in fact are in, other employment.Those retired on ill-health grounds, and widows, for example,will in any case have their pensions reviewed biennially.Civil Service Department SWl22nd May 19703
ANNEXFollowing the undertakings given during the consideration ofthe Pensions (Increase) Bill in 1969, the Government have been considering the arrangements for increasing public service pensionsand have decided in principle that public service pensions (i. e. thoseof retired civil servants, local government employees, teachers,National Health Service employees, police, firemen, members ofthe Armed Forces and many smaller groups) shall in future beincreased on a new basis designed to give regular and automaticcompensation for increases in the cost of living.    For the future,these pensions will be adjusted biennially in proportion to the changein the cost of living during the two preceding years.    In addition thenext Pensions (Increase) Bill will provide that those pensions which,under the operation of earlier Acts, have received less than fullcompensation for increases in the cost of living, shall be restored to their original real value before applying the biennial adjustment.Pensions increase will normally be payable, as now, from the age of60 onwards.4
