MINISTRY   OF   DEFENCEMAIN   BUILDING,   WHITEHALL, LONDON,   S. W. I.TELEPHONE     01-930  7022MINISTER OF defence for EOUIPMENTC-lyncorrwg Colliery is due to close next Friday, 1st May,Having served in the Ministry of Power, assisted in pilotingthrough the Coal industry Act 1965, and having had to explain the closure of all the other pits, Duffryn Rhondda, Newlands;ana Afan in my constituency, I hone it can be understood thatI an: not advancing a purely constituency interest in advocatingfurther consideration of the future of this pit.2.    SUE.P. on 8th April invited the Paymaster General toconsider urgently ways of reducing the national smokeless fuelshortage next v/inter.    In his letter of 22nd April he reported,inter alia, that 5 gasworks which would otherwise be closed i could be kept going yielding 150,000 tons at a cost of  1.6M,Irepresenting an extra cost of  9.3 a ton on average.    Thefigures for each individual gasworks are not available to me.3.    Glyncorrwg normally produces about 120,000 tons of coal,according to the pit&apos;s manager.    Almost 60$ of&apos;its production is duff used for blending and since it is rather good qualitymaterial, and more costly, other pits are not always happy tohave duff from Glyncorrwg - they can do with something cheaper.4.   But much more important is the 40$ of the 120,000 tons -which is not blended. &apos; About 11-12$ is stove nuts, 10$ stovess% cobbles, and 10$ beans.    They are divided into these particular parts because different stoves are needec^to burndifferent types - some commercial, some domestic.    1 am informed that I may be conservative in estimating this break-down as 60/40$.    The 40$ may be higher in fact.    At any rate,something like 50,000 tons is a straight burning smokeless fuel.5.   The Ministry of Technology&apos; told me on 8th April:-&quot;The closure of Glyncorrwg on 1st May will be thefirst closure of an anthracite pit for over a year ...But the colliery has been losing money very heavily. 140,000, equivalent to 18/- per ton, was lost in1968-69 and in 1969-70, to end December, the loss v/as 225,000, equivalent to  2.12.10. per ton.&quot;6.   Absenteeism, at Glyncorrwg was running at 309$ at the.beginning of the year. .   Through strenuous efforts by theN..U.M, this was reduced to 15$ by the end of February./Unfortunately
MINISTRY   OF   DEFENCEMAIN   BUILDING,   WHITEHALL, LONDON,   S. W. 1.TELEPHONE    01-930 7022MINISTER OF defence for EQUIPMENTunfortunately there were four disputes in March and absenteeismrose to 27$.     Given that the pit is in its last few days it isunderstandable that there is now a much higher figure.    I amtold that the N.C.B. now seeks to argue its costs on the current level of attendance.    This is patently unreasonable.     given a new lease of life the pit would return to a degree ofnormality.    In any event the men cannot be wholly beyond     jredemption because the N.C.B. justify the social effects of   jclosure by their intention to re-employ 340 in other pits,retaining another 80 in salvage, and the only retirements and!redundancies would be 100 nearly all of whom are likely to be55 or over.   I . .7.    I understand it is now argued that it is unsafe to continueraining here.    This is a new argument, and certainly not advanced to me by either pit manager last v/eek or the men.   - Its onlyrelevance is that pits close themselves unless faces are keptgoing.8.   Lord Robens seeks to place the onus entirely on theGovernment for the closure.    He wrote to me on the 26th March:&quot;If the Government wished us to keep this pit open for socialreasons then we could&apos;do so under the provisions of the Act.However, there has been no indication in this direction.&quot;9.   I concede the difficult record of this pit.    But successfulefforts, albeit with a setback,&apos; no doubt aggravated by the non-arrival of a reprieve, were being made to correct this.    Giventhe 50,000 tons of directly burnable, unmixed coal which can boproduced, the thermal quality of 1 ton of coal as opposed to1 ton of coke, the price we are prepared to pay for 150,000 tonsof extra coke at an average  9.3 per ton compared with thispifs  2.12.10, per ton loss on&apos;coal in the last availableperiod, I submit that this pifs closure now would be a mistakeagainst the background of a national smokeless fuel shortageand the other measures proposed to mitigate this.10.  I am copying this to the Paymaster General and theSecretary of State for Wales.(intd.) J.M.
