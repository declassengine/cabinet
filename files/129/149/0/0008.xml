DOCUMENT IS THE PPvOPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government(70) 48 COPY no. 7 April 1970CABINET63INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS bill memorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretaryof State for Employment and Productivity1. At its meeting on 30 October 1969 (CC(69) 52nd Conclusions,Minute 4), the Cabinet decided that the Industrial Relations BUI should contain the provisions listed in Annex I to this memorandum, subject tofurther detailed consideration by the Committee on Industrial Relations.The Cabinet also agreed that the Committee should examine the need forlegislative provision on 3 other matters - the registration of procedure agreements by employers; anti-trade union rules of Friendly Societies;and the appointment of employee representatives to the boards of undertakings,2.        The Industrial Relations Committee have reviewed the proposedprovisions of the Bill and have discussed the controversial issues whichhave arisen In the course of consultations with the Trades Union Congress(TUC) and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).    A summary of the issues and of the CommitteeTs conclusions is attached at Annex II for theinformation of my colleagues.3.        So far as the overall shape of the Bill i3 concerned, the committee agreed that the Bill should include those provisions decided on by Cabinetin October - with 2 modifications.    First, the Committee agreed that itwould be inadvisable to seek to restrict the Immunity enjoyed by tradeunions (under Section 4 of the 1905 Trade Disputes Act) from actions in tortto those torts committed in pursuance of trade disputes.    This proposal had been made in the Donovan Commission^ Report, and was endorsed inthe White Paper &quot;In Place of Strife&quot;.    But in view of the Cabinet^ssubsequent decision not to extend the protection afforded by Section 3 of theTrade Disputes Act to cover inducement of the breach of any commercialcontract, the Committee thought it necessary to reconsider whether itwould be wise to effect any change in Section 4,    The effect of the change proposed would be to make it possible to secure damages from unions (andto get injunctions against them) in respect of torts arising otherwise than
&quot;in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute&quot;.    But since there canbe situations where strike action is taken in circumstances where thecourts jtidge that no &quot;trade dispute&quot; exists (eg Torquay Hotel v. Cousinsand Stratford v. I/indley), a narrowing of the immunity from action fortore could have the effect of putting union funds at risk in some caseswhere they take industrial action.    For this reason, there would be great pressure from the TUC to widen the definition cf a trade dispute to cover any industrial or strike action by unions.    The Committee felt that on balance it would be preferable to leave Section 4 (and the definition of a trade dispute) as it was,4. Secondly, the Committee decided that the Bill should preventFriendly Societies from having rules debarring trade unionists from membership (Annex II, paragraph 6).OUTSTANDING ISSUES5.        There are 3 issues on which the Committee did not reach a finalor agreed conclusion and which I was invited to bring before Cabinet; andthere is a fourth I wish to bring to the C&amp;binefs attention:a, the application to the Crown of the requirement on employers to disclose information to recognised trade unions;b. the circumstances in which it would be permissible for an employer to require his employee to belong to a specified,,independent trade union;c0        how to ensure that Industrial Tribunals are capable ofI    dealing with the additional load of cases arising from the industrial relations Bill?d,        the powers of the Commission on Industrial Relations (CIR),DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION BY MANAGEMENT: APPLICATION TOTHE CROWN6.        The Industrial Relations Committee were generally agreed cn thenature and extent of the requirement on employers to disclose to recognisedunions information necessary and relevant to negotiations, and on thevarious safeguards which the Bill should contain to protect employersfrom having to disclose information which could be damaging (Annex II,paragraph 2).    The Committee did not, however, reach any agreement about the application to the Crown of the disclosure requirements.    I wastherefore invited to put before Cabinet the various arguments on thisquestion.
7. It was argued by some members of the Committee that there werepowerful constitutional and practical reasons for exempting the government from the disclosure provisions.    On the other hand, it was suggested thatno new points of principle were involved and that, if the Government sought to avoid the obligation laid on other employers it would find it difficult to insist that employers in the private sector should be subject to thestatutory requirements.8. The main constitutional arguments for Crown exemption are that ministers are responsible to Parliament for the administration of their departments and because of the special position of the Government theirdischarge of that responsibility may on occasion be difficult or evenimpossible to reconcile with the full requirements of legislation of thiskind.    In general, therefore, it is preferable for such legislation not to bind the Crown but for the Government to state their intention to abide by its spirit.    Exceptions have been made to this principle, but only wherethere have been compelling reasons for binding the Crown (for example,the Race Relations Act, 1968).    Although exemption will be criticised by employers and trade unions, if the Crown was bound there would be likelyto be even more serious criticism in particular cases where Ministersfound their special position made it impossible to disclose information which other employers were expected to disclose.    Departments possess alarge amount of sensitive information the disclosure of which could be particularly damaging or embarrassing;  it would be impossible to foreseeand provide for all situations in which disclosure could cause difficulties,and therefore Ministers should be free of any statutory responsibility onthis matter.9.        Against this, it must be emphasised that the principle of independentadjudication or arbitration in matters affecting the Civil Service is nothingnew - cf. the Grown Proceedings Act - and that other employers would beunimpressed by an undertaking that the Civil Service abide by the spirit ofthe legislation, if the question whether this was being observed was not opento independent scrutiny; that scrutiny is after all, exactly what other employers find most objectionable about the proposals.    Furthermore, itis not proposed to take away from any Minister tne right and responsibility in the last resort to decide whether or not information should be disclosed;nor is it suggested that any refusal by a Minister to disclose information should attract any formal sanction.    So far as sensitive information isconcerned, the safeguards already proposed (eg. those relating to national security, to information about individuals, and to confidential information from or abovit third parties) are very extensive; there will be opportunityto include in the proposed Code of Practice and regulations additionalsafeguards to those included in the Bill; and in any case, private employershave many of the same problems in regard to disclosure as GovernmentDepartments,10.       In my view, there are the strongest political and presentationalreasons for applying the disclosure requirements to the crowdy/n.    i recommend we should so decide.
STATUTORY RIGHT TO BELONG TO A TRADE UNION: REGULATION OFTHE CLOSED SHOPU.        The Bill will provide that it should be an implied term of everycontract of employment that the employer should do nothing to prevent ordeter his employees from belonging to an independent trade union, or topenalise thern for doing so.    It is no purpose of the legislation to regulate the closed chop, or to give the employee a statutory right to belong to anyunion he chooses - or to belong to no union at all.    The Bill will thereforesay nothing about an employer&apos;s right to require his employees to belong toa specified union.    It will, however, be necessary to make it clear that an employer will not be acting in breach of the statutory provision if herestricts the choice of his employees to a particular independent tradeunion - ie, if they choose to belong they must belong to union rx*.    the tuc are pressing for the Bill to include a proviso that such a restrictionshould be permissible only where there is an agreement between the employer and the union concerned - though it is net clear exactly how theywould take this to be achieved,1Z.       I believe there are considerable risks in adopting the TUCsuggestion, which will not in any case secure the results they expect orhope for,    I am, however, examining the possibility that employers whorecognise and negotiate with trade unions might be permitted to restrict the employees  choice of independent trade union only to the unions - or some of the unions - with whom they negotiate.    Employers who do not recognise and negotiate with trade unions would not be permitted to restricttheir employeecT choice.    It seems to me that this will substantially meetthe tuc&apos;s point and I intend to discuss the proposal with the TUC.    Subjectto the tuc&apos;s reaction, I would propose either to include a provision onthese lines in the Bill or to leave the Bill silent about the circumstances where it is permissible for an employer to restrict his employees&apos;freedom of choice.THE LOAD ON INDUSTRIAL TJR.I3UNALS13.       The main outstanding problem arising from the provision forappeals against unfair dismissals and extension of the jurisdiction ofIndustrial Tribunals is the capacity of Tribunals to cope with the work.Research has indicated that this may be a problem of considerablemagnitude.   For that reason I have reluctantly had to introduce certaindisincentives and restrictions into the proposals: for example, a qualifying period of 2 years1 service for appeal against unfair dismissal(except for trade union membership and activity, where there will be noqualifying period) in the hope that it can be relaxed when the position ofthe Industrial Tribunals improves.    Even so it is estimated that thecaseload will be about 25, 000 to 40, 000 a year and the Lord Chancellor hasadvised that this would intolerably overload the existing Tribunals.    TheCommittee on Industrial Relations has invited the Lord Chancellor and myself, in consultation with the Chief Secretary, to seek a solution to the
problem and v/e are considering the adoption of a 2-tier system of a numberof local Tribunals and a right of appeal to a superior Tribunal.    Moreover,until satisfactory administrative arrangements are devised, the extensionof the TribunalsT jurisdiction to disputes arising from the individualcontract of employment will need to be delayed.    This will not be unwelcome to the TUC and CBI who oppose this provision.THE POWERS OF THE COMMISSION ON INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS.14.       The TUC are not in favour of the proposal to establish the CIR ona statutory basis, but they have not given me any precise reasons, beyondgeneralities about rigidity and inflexibility and susceptibility toGovernment influence, which do not seem to me to be well-founded.    TheCommittee on Industrial Relations agreed that a body exercising suchimportant statutory powers should be established and regulated by statute.I therefore propose to go ahead with these provisions.15.       The provisions will give the CIR power to require persons toprovide information and give evidence in connection with its inquiries.The question of enforcement arises.    I propose that the CIR should have powers, like those given to the National Board for Prices and Incomes(NBPI) under the Prices and Incomes Act, to take proceedings against tradeunions and employers1 associations, as well as against corporate bodies and individuals, for failure to provide information, etc.    It will beremembered that when a similar question arose in connection with theCommission for Industry and Manpower Bill (CIM), it was decided that itwould be undesirable to make trade unions liable to proceedings and penalties; the liability was therefore confined to corporate bodies and individuals (who could, of course, be trade union officers).    TheCommittee on Industrial Relations have, however, accepted the view thatprovisions in relation to the CIR should follow the NBPI rather than theCIM.    The penalties are not comparable to the penal sanctions envisaged in the interim Industrial Relations Bill.    The CIR by its nature, will bemore involved than the CIM in getting information from trade unions andemployers1 associations, and may therefore need a sanction against refusal to produce it.TUC AND CBI REACTIONS16,        The foregoing proposals will by and large be welcomed by the TUCas a sound basis for legislation subject to one major reservation.    Theygreatly regret the Governmenfs decision not to extend the protection of the1906 Act to cover inducement of the breach of any commercial contract.    ButI am convinced that no developments since last October would justify any modification of the decision then taken by the Cabinet not to yield on thispoint.17.        The CBI are opposed to the Bill which they regard as one-sided andas mostly involving concessions to the trade unions.
CONCLUSION18.        I invite rny colleagues to agree that:-a. the provisions on disclosure of information by employers should apply to the Crown, but there should be no provision forsanctions against any Minister who refuses to disclose information;b. I should decide the circumstances in which an employermay restrict an employee1^ membership to a particular union inthe light of further consultation with the TUC;c. satisfactory administrative arrangements for IndustrialTribunals should be devised by the Lord Chancellor and myself,in consultation with the Chief Secretary;d. the CIR should be established as a statutory body with powers to take proceedings against trade unions and employers associations, as well as against corporate bodies and individuals,for failure to provide information relevant to che Commissionswork.B A department of Employment and Productivity SW16 April 1970

NFIDENTJALANNEX ii report ON ISSUES RAISED IN THE COURSE OF CONSULTATION ON THE G03/ERNMENT&apos; SLEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS AND ON CONCLUSIONS REACHED BY THE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONSCOMMITTEE1.    RECOGNITION OF TRADE UNIONSComplaints of non-compliance with a recognition order.The TUC have pressed the Government to modify the procedure under whicha union may complain if an employer fails to comply with a statutoryrecognition order.   Under the G-overnment&apos; s original proposals, a complaint of this kind would have been referred to the Industrial Court.   The TUC believethat the CIR would be a more appropriate body for adjudicating on thesecomplaints, particularly since the CIR will have made the recommendations onwhich the order would be based.   The Industrial Relations Committee acceptedthe force of the tuc&apos;s view, and agreed that this change in the statutoryprocedure should be made .Position of the nationalised industriesRepresentatives of the nationalised industries have expressed some-jconcernthat the provisions on recognition of trade unions appear to over-ride thestatutory responsibility laid on nationalised undertakings to establishappropriate consultative and negotiating machinery.    The Industrial relations committee agreed, however, that in the event of a reference to the CIR of a recognition dispute involving a nationalised undertaking, it was necessaryto provide that any subsequent statutory recognition order made by the Secretaryof State should supersede the discretion given under the appropriatenationalisation statute .2.     DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION BY MANAGEMENTThe TUC have welcomed the proposals, but have suggested that they shouldbe extended to require the disclosure of information needed to further the participation of employees in the processes leading to the taking of management decisions.   This phrase seems to cover some aspects of bothnegotiation and consultation.The CBI have expressed total opposition to any statutory requirementon an employer to disclose to a recognised trade union information which is relevant and necessary to negotiations in which they engaged-v^The CBI believe this to be an unreasonable   infringement of management&apos;s discretion, whichis not calculated to further the development of satisfactory collective bargaining.   In order to allay some of the more justified anxieties ofemployers, the Industrial Relations Committee agreed that:/a. the statutory
conu;TD&apos;B :;teala. the statutory requirement should be related to negotiations, and not extended to consultation between an employer and trade union officials;b. more detailed guidance about the requirement should be provided ina Code of Practice, in the preparation of which the CBI and TUG wouV..be consulted. Parliament would be required to approve the Code of Practicebefore the requirement to disclose information becomes effective;c. there should be additional safeguards to protect information whichit might be unreasonable or damaging for an employer to disclose.The Industrial Relations Committee did not reach a view whether the disclosurerequirement should apply to the Crown (see paragraphs 6-10 of the memorandum).3.     IMMUNITIES AFFORDED BY SECTION 3 OF THE 1906 ACTLabour-only contractsThe Industrial Relations Committee agreed that the scope of Section 3 ofthe 1906 Act should be extended to cover contracts personally to execute work as well as contracts of employment or service.    This would make it possiblefor union officials to induce a breach of a contract with a self-employedworker or with a gang of self-employed workers.    It would not make lawful anyinducement of a broach of a commercial contract between two companies underwhich one of them agrees to furnish the other with labour to do a particularpiece of work.Ex parte injunctionsThe TUC have expressed concern about these injunctions which they claimcan materially weaken union action,.   It is also alleged that union officialssometimes hear nothing about the proceedings taken by the employer until the judge has actually decided to award an injunction.,   I am in touch with theLord Chancellor on these allegations.   On ex parte injunctions per bo, theIndustrial obligation Committee did not consider that the comparatively rareoccasions on which an ex parte injunction was awarded against trade union officials provided grounds for special protection for unions from theseproceedings .4.    EXTENSION OF JURISDICTION OF INDUSTRIAL TRIBUNALSThe TUC and CBI oppose the proposal to extend the jurisdiction ofIndustrial Tribunals to disputes arising from the individual contract ofemployment.   The Industrial Relations - Committee nevertheless agreed in/principleCONFIDENTIAL
principle that legislation should he introduced hut expressed concern aboutthe load on the Tribunals which night result from the proposed extension oftheir jurisdiction.    The Committee therefore invited the Departments chiefly-concerned (Lord Chancellor&apos;s Department, Treasury and Department of employment and Productivity) to consider further the administrative problems which wouldbe involved in implementing the decision previously agreed (see paragraph 14of the memorandum).5.   SAFEGUARDS AGAINST UNFAIR DISMISSALThe Committee approved a number of changes proposed in the provisions tosafeguard employees against unfair dismissal (in particular, the basis ofcompensation).   The Committee also agreed that the protection against unfairdismissal should not apply to the dismissal of strikers during a strike unless it was found to be for one of the specified unfair reasons (for example, an employer would not be able to use the excuse provided by a strike fordismissing workers on the grounds of colour, race, sex, etc) .6.   RULES OF FRIENDLY SOCIETIESAt its meeting in October 1969, Cabinet invited the Industrial relations committee to consider further whether it was desirable to legislate to preventFriendly Societies having rules debarring members of trade unions from membership or benefits of Friendly Societies.   The TUC have taken the viewthat, although the particular society most complained of in the past(the Foremen and Staff Mutual Benefit Society) has repealed its anti-tradeunion rules, it would be desirable nonetheless to make legislative provision to prevent any other society adopting similar rules in the future. - TheIndustrial Relations Committee concurred and recommended that appropriateclauses should be included in the Bill.7.   REGISTRATION OF PROCEDURE agreements the Industrial Relations Committee agreed that the Secretary of state should have powers, should improve necessary, to make regulations requiringemployers to register any written procedure agreements or arrangements.8.   MODIFICATION OF SECTION l+ih) OF 1871 TRADE UNION ACT AND AMENDMENT OF the definition OF A TRADE UNIONThese provisions will enable agreements between employers&apos; associations and trade unions to be directly enforceable if there is an express writtenprovision in the agreement to that effect.   The TUG have not objected to this,CO^DEOTIAL /^Ployers&apos;
confidentialEmployers&apos; associations will in future no longer be defined as trade unions in it the political fund provisions of the Trade Union Act, 1913 will continuel.o apply to them.    The TUC attached importance to this and. the CBI did not object.9.   TRADE UNION DEVELOPMENT SCHEMEThere are clearly different views inside the TUC about this proposal and.the tuc&apos;s official reaction has boon very tepid.   On present informationthey will not oppose it,10. REQU.TOEMENTS FOR REGISTERED TRADE UNIONS TO APPOINT QUALIFIED AUDITORSAND TO CARRY OUT REGULAR VALUATIONS OF THEIR SUPERANNUATION schemes the TUC have not objected, to these proposals.11.   APPOINTMENT OP WORKERS&apos; REPRESENTATIVES TO BOARDS OP UNDERTAKINGSNeither the TUC nor the CBI have expressed groat interest in. theWhite Paper proposal, that the Government would consider what more needed tobe done to facilitate the appointment of employee representatives to management boards.   The Industrial Relations Committee noted thai; a discussiondocument outlining some of the major issues for consideration has been sentto the TUC, CBI and nationalised industries.   This sets out fully the pros andcons of different possible developments in this field.   No replies to it have yet boon received.   Whatever the reactions to it, it was not expected, that any conclusions would, be reached which would necessitate the inclusion of enablingprovisions in the Bill.confidential
