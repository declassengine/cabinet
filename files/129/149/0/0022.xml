iENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNSIENTC(70) 6212 May 1970CABINETPROPOSED NEY/ POWER FOR THE COMMISSION FOR INDUSTRYAND MANPOWER BILL TO CONTROL EXPENDITURE ONADVERTISING AND SALES PR.OMOTIONMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade, As I shall not be present when the memorandum (C(70) 57) by theFirst Secretary of State and Secretary of State for Employment and productivity is discussed, it may be helpful to my colleagues if I explainbriefly my reasons for thinking that action at the present time would be unwise.2, Experts would not, as I understand it, dispute that in some circumstances high advertising and promotion expenditure can constitute a barrier to entry into a particular product market, and hence caneffectively preserve or raise the degree of monopoly in an industry.Equally they recognise that, whether by competition between marketleaders or by individual company mis judgment, the level of such expen-diture may rise beyond the point at which it is economically advantageous to the consumer.3. What is not known is by exactly how much, in what circumstances,and with what overall effects a particular level of advertising and salespromotion produces these results,    The corollary is, of course, that wedo not know what cutback will produce the desired direct result, or whatpeculiar side effects it may generate.    This lack of knowledge - whichthe research to be commissioned by the Board of Trade is designed to remedy as far as is practicable - is generally recognised.    It was admitted by ray predecessor when, in the course of announcing theaction which followed the Monopolies Commission report on detergents,he told the House on 26 April 1967:-&quot;My examination of this problem has led me to conclude that we know too little about the economic effects of advertising in general,and its relationship to competition.    Accordingly I have decided to institute some independent research into this subject&quot;,COPY NO gg
4. Industry is aware of the nature of the study we are about to commission from a small team headed by Professor Cowling at theUniversity of Yfarv/ick.    So far from arousing alarm or suspicion,it has been recognised by leading figures as a sensible and usefulapproach, and industry has promised co-operation in providing the data which is essential for an effective study.    The terms of reference for the study are:-i. To examine the circumstances in which advertising andpromotional expenditures become of major importance in the competitive strategies adopted in different industries.ii. To study the extent to which, and the circumstances inwhich, advertising and promotion lead to an increase in the totalmarket for a group of products, and how they operate to determine the shares of different brands within the total market.iii. To determine the part played by advertising and promotion,in association v/ith the scale of operations, price competition andother factors, in influencing the entry to a market of new com-competitors and new products, and through this their effects on the structure of particular industries.5.        If we are now seen to take powers, available in a wide range of circumstances, for action on the level of advertising which by our ownadmission v/e lack the knowledge to take with a clear understanding of theconsequences, then as I see it:-i. We shall arouse - however unjustified - strong suspicionsthat the Government designs to attack advertising far more widelyand dangerously than the First Secretary has in mind, andconsequently attract very great hostility among the interested parties, which we may expect to be ventilated in Press and television media,ii. Against the background of such suspicion, industry will no longer co-operate in providing data on which the success ofour research - and, therefore, the prospect of a sound basis for action in the future - entirely depend,6. These considerations, and the considerable practical difficultiesin the way of using the proposed power even where a case for its applica-tion is made out, in my view outweigh the arguments for seeking the power at this time.R MBoard of Trade SW112 May 1970
