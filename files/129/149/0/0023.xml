j5DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ government(70) 63 COPY NO13th May. 1970CABINETLONDON TRANSPORT FARESMemorandum by the Minister of TransportBackgroundIn my memorandum (C(70) 59) I set out the main features of thefare increase proposals put forward by the London Transport executive to the Greater London Council (GLC),  and the main arguments as I sawthem at that stage for and against the reference of these proposals to theNational Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI),    The Cabinet decided atthis meeting on 7th May (CC(70) 21st Conclusions) to defer a decision until the GLC reached a final conclusion on the proposals,and I was invited to circulate a further paper on the subject at that stage.I was also asked to provide information on the relative rate of increase over the last few years in commuter fares in London and the otherconurbations, and this is contained at Annex A.Present Position2.      At the Council meeting on Tuesday 12th May the GLC, afterlengthy debate, approved the proposals, and the way is thus clear for theLondon Transport Executive to put them into effect,    The date they have in mind is Sunday 16th August.3.      The increases proposed are of course particularly unwelcome atthis time.    They represent an overall increase of some 14 per cent,although the impact on particular fares will of course be in some casessubstantially higher.    One feature that has attracted controversy is theproposed increase to Is. of the minimum underground fare in central london.    Major fares increases of this order must inevitably give riseto concern.4.      The argument in the GLC turned, as was expected, not so much onthe make up of the anticipated financial shortfall, which is largely due towage increases already granted or expected, as on the basic policyargument as to whether the travelling public should bear the whole burdenby way of increased fares or whether in order to reduce hardship and to minimise a further diversion of traffic from public to private transport the extra cost should be carried in part or in whole on the rates.    The1
GLC Opposition argued strongly for the latter course, but the majorityparty stuck to their line that while they were prepared to inject substantialcapital into the undertaking they were not prepared to contemplate generalsubsidy on revenue account.Statutory position.      As I made clear in my earlier paper, the Government has underthe terms of the Transport (London) Act 1969 no power of veto overLondon Transport fares.    That Act, like the Transport Act 1968 whichestablished the Passenger Transport Authority in the conurbations,specifically made the financial policies to be followed by local transport undertakings a matter for local discussion and decision.    For that reason fares in London are subjected neither to control by the transport tribunal or the Traffic Commissioners nor to Ministerial intervention.6.      As I explained, there are in this particular case serious legaldoubts as to whether the standstill powers under the Prices and IncomesActs could be applied; owing to .an ambiguity in the drafting, the matter would turn on a decision whether the Transport (London) Act 1969 wasto be regarded as a &quot;local Act or not.    This is a point on which it ispretty clear that London Transport could, if we attempted to use thepowers, seek to set our action aside in the Courts,    In any case, apartfrom legal doubts, there are policy arguments against the use of the standstill powers at this stage.    Thusc although reference of the proposals as such presents no legal problems, there is no guarantee whatsoever thatthe GLC would be prepared to defer the implementation of the proposalspending the NBPI investigation, nor could they be expected necessarilyto modify the proposals to meet any criticisms the NBPI might make.Issues for consideration7.      In the course of last week*s discussion, two main issues were raised on which I think I should comment;-a.     DecimalisationIt was suggested that the move by London Transport to a Is.minimum fare on the Underground in the inner zone, andtheir general move towards an Underground tariff based onIs, steps, might set a bad example to other undertakings inadvance of decimalisation.    It is certainly true that london transport do favour a simplified structure on tube fares andthere must therefore be a suspicion that they will in the fairlynear future eliminate the remaining 6d,   tube fares.    Butgiven that they are for the moment at least keeping the 6d.in vise on the tube outside central London, and on the busesgenerally, they could not and indeed do not argue that thenew structure is in any way a result of the introduction ofdecimal coinage.    As far as precedents for other organisations2
are concerned they are the only municipal undertakingexcept Glasgow to operate an underground rail networksthe field in which they might have acted as a pacemakeris that of bus fares, where they have in fact kept the 6d.and propose to convert directly to 2^p.Special position of LondonUntil the passing of the Transport (London) Act, Londonershad a favoured position in relation to public transport, inthat they were served by a nationalised industry in the shape of the London Transport Board (tons), whose deficitsfell as a charge on the Exchequer.    The purpose of theTransport (London) A.ct was to pass this responsibility overto where it properly belonged - to local government inLondon.    Tc achieve this handover we had to make a very substantial financial contribution in the shape of the writingoff of the whole of the tons&apos;s capital debt to the Governmentamounting to some  25 0 million in all; this represents anannual subsidy to London Transport of about  11 million.This special treatment caused considerable resentmentelsewhere in the country.    I am sure that having justcompleted this handover we cannot risk a situation in whichwe appear to be officially sensitive to the needs of the Londontravelling public, or give any grounds for thinking that thereis a chance of Exchequer subsidies for London Transport.It could be argued that we need to demonstrate that london transport fares are subject to Prices and Incomes policy,but at present it seems to me more important that we shouldstress the basic point that the responsibility now rests withLondoners themselves and not with central Government.This now seems to be accepted by the Press and it is forconsideration whether any intervention on our part might serve to switch the atfcack from the GLC to the Government.It was suggested that any allegation of favourable treatment for Londoners could be obviated by a more widely basedreference of fares on London and the conurbations,     a comparison of the position is set out in Annex A, from whichit will be seen that Lcndon is near the lower end of the range of fares increases when the conurbations are compared with one another.    But I think it is worth making the point alsothat for the moment fares in the Passenger Transport Areaslike bus fares elsewhere in the country outside London remain under the control of the independent Traffic Commissioners,with a right of appeal to the Minister of Transport.    For thisamong other reasons we have in the past taken the view thata general reference of bus fares would present serious difficulties.3
8.     I think it is also right to point out that the NBPI examinedLondon Transport fares as recently as the spring of 1969.    TheirReport No. 112 was published just a year ago.    The present proposalsappear largely to follow the recommendations of that Report.    Inparticular, the Report advocated a movement towards higher fares for short distances on th* vjaderground (paragraph 21) and also endorsed the concept of a differentiated price structure between the inner and outerzones of London (paragraphs 22-26 and 7 8).    Thus the Is. minimum onthe tubes in Inner London is broadly in accordance with recent NBPIthinking, and would very probably be endorsed in any new Report.     Myfear is that if a reference were to be made we would at best get from the nbpi a general approval for the proposals; at worst, there is a real risk that the NBPI might attempt to apply to these fares the ideas on marginalcost pricing which they advanced on British Rail London fares, and thusproduce an even more controversial package.conclusions .   a.   The main issue in the debate on the London Transport faresproposals is the policy one of fares increases versus ratessubsidies,    The Government is not in a position to comedown on one side or the other, since its declared policy informing both the Transport Act 1968 and the Transport(London) Act 1969 is that this is a matter for local decision.b. NBPI reported on London Transport fares only last year, andtheir report approved in particular a system of differentiatedfares between the inner and outer zones of London.    I doubt whether they would be in the position to add a great deal towhat they said on the previous occasion, and I doubt whether in particular they could appropriately be expected to comment on the basic policy issue I have mentioned above.c. At this stage, there is no public tendency to associate theGovernment with the London fares increases - there hasindeed been only one Press call to my Department on them,and I have received two letters in all on the subject.    I fear that a decision to refer the proposals to NBPI will serveonly to transfer the odium for the increases to the Government -and the corresponding disillusionment when at the end of theday it is unlikely to prove practicable to enforce the outcome of the NBPI Report.d. Having just divested ourselves of financial responsibility for london Transport, we must not now give any grounds forthinking that there is a possibility of our taking on any futurefinancial involvements.    In my view such an involvementcould be implied albeit indirectly, through an NBPI reference of these particular proposals.4
e.   For these reasons, it seems to me that the balance ofadvantage suggests that no reference be made of thecurrent London Transport fares proposals,    J  askedI should say pfdblicly that the Government have decided not to refer the proposals, and laying the responsibilityclearly on the GLC.FWMMinistry of Transport SE113th May 19705
J0HPAR1SON OE FARES INCREASES SINCE 1965 IN LONDON AND OTHER CONURBATIONS1,  AREAS COMPARED:hc urban areas most readily comparable with London in terms ofsize are the major conurbations of Glasgow, Merseyside, South Eastiancs/North East Cheshire (SELNEC), &quot;Jest Midlands and Tyneside.I, The previously municipally operated services of all thejonurbat ions (except Glasgow) are now under the control^ of passenger Transport Executives, established ma inly in the latter part cf 1969 under the Transport Act 1968,3. For the years prior to 1970, when the transport undertakings;/ere municipally owned, it is not possible to give a single figure for each of the conurbations representing the aggregated faresincreases of all the various constituent undertakings.   The figures given however for the undertaking of the major local authorityalone in each conurbation provide a guide to the order of commuterfares increases outside London as compared with the capital, andare as follows:-*Tne executives are appointed by and are responsiDle to the passenger transport Authorities comprised largely of representatives of thelocai authorities in the Areas.    In due course, when orders are madeUnder Section 19 of the Transport Act the control of fares in thePTA&quot;s which are ac present in the hands of the statutorilyindependent Traffic commissioners will pass to tne Executivesthemselves though they must seek the approval of their PassengefTransport Authority for any change in the general level of   fares.

The impact of a fares increase on an individualpassenger therefore tends to be slightly greater than thefigures quoted.(ii) The following rate precepts are to be levied by the passenger transport Authorities on constituent local authorities:West Midlands:SELNEC:Merseyside:Tyneside:NILNILkid in the  1d in the  
k, - in London, fares increases were deferred in 1 965 and 1967 at   -reauest of the Government.    In addition, the 1968 increase was lessthan that sought by the London Transport Board because of a rulingmade by the Transport Tribunal whose control over London fares wasterminated last year under the provisions of the Transport (London)Act.   In 1968 and I969 those local authorities whose transport undertakings were to be transferred to Passenger TransportExecutives were considerably influenced by that fact in deciding whether or not to apply for fares increases..5.  Given these complicating factors, it is difficult to establish a direct comparison between commuter fares in London and the otherconurbations, but the broad conclusion to be drawn from these figuresis that fares increases in London over the period shown aretogether with those in Liverpool at the lower end of the range offares increases in the conurbations.
