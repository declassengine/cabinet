DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ government(70) 58 COPY no May 1970CABINETINTER URBAN ROAD STRATEGYMemorandum by the Minister of transport at its meeting on 28 April the Ministerial Steering Committee onEconomic Policy endorsed the proposals for a revised strategic network of inter-urban roads in England within the next 15-20 years and invited me tosubmit the text of the White Paper to the Cabinet for consideration,2,        The Committee agreed that maps to be published with the white paper should be sent for printing.    This has been done.    The map showingthe current position on motorways and trunk roads has been brought up todate and will be printed in different colours from the main strategy map toavoid any misunderstanding or confusion between them.    The keys havealso been modified to make it quite clear what each map portrays and, inparticular, to indicate the precise nature of the route feasibility studiesillustrated.3.        Secondly, the Committee suggested that further consideration shouldbe given to the wisdom of indicating in the White Paper that expenditure onurban roads was planned to rise to over half the road programme by the1980s,    I have discussed with the Minister without Portfolio the form of words which I proposed in the corrigendum to the White Paper circulated on27 April.    In my view, it is important to retain these words.    If we are less^pecific about expenditure on urban roads, it might well be assumed thatif the new inter-urban strategy takes 20 years to complete, the road programme as a whole may diminish in future years.    This assumption wouldbe unjustified and could seriously reduce the impact of the White Paperproposals.    The wording proposed in paragraph 26 is still fairly generaland would, in effect, leave open the rate at which we develop our urbantransport policy and the precise level of the urban road programme year by year.    On this understanding, the Minister without Portfolio is prepared toaccept the draft I proposed, which is now incorporated in paragraph 26 ofthe attached draft.1
CONCLUSION4.        I invite my colleagues to approve the text of the attached draft white Paper for printing and publication in early June with maps already approved by the Steering Committee on Economic Policy.f w mMinistry of Transport SE14 May 19702

DRAFT WHIT E PAPERROADS FOR TilE FUTURE:  THE NEW INTER-URBAI PLAN FOR ENGLANDINTRODUCTION1.    The White Paper on Transport Policy (Cmnd 3057), published inJuly 1966, described the Government&apos; s policy for the years ahead;,including the steps being taken to reconcile the country&apos;s national and regional transport needs and the manner in which the various forms of communication, inter-urban and urban, were being developed to form a coherent and integrated system.    Since that time the policy outlined in Cmnd 3057 has been gradually developed and implemented.During 1367 a series of White Papers was published on Railwav policy(Cmnd 3439), on the Transport of Freight (Cmnd 3470), on public transport and Traffic (Cmnd 3481) and on the Waterways (Cmnd 3401).Effect was given to the policies set out in these White Papers bythe Transport Act 1968.    In March 1967   the Government and theBritish Railways Board published details of the basic railway networkivhich was to be retained and developed.

The present paper carries this development oftransport policy one stage further by setting out the Government1 sstrategy and plan for the development of the inter-urban trunk road system in England over the next 15 to 20 years.2.    This new strategy and plan have been developed from the proposals outlined in the Green Paper, &quot;Roads for the Future&quot;, published as abasis for discussion in March 1969.   The aim is to provide a comprehensive national system of trunk roads on which commercialtraffic and private cars can move freely and safely and on whichcongestion and the frustration and economic costs it creates will have/been-1-CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALbeen virtually eliminated.    This will make&apos;.a major contribution tothe lon^ term planning of the economy, and to the planning of regional and industrial development and of the whole physicalenvironment.   The proposals take full account of existing plans forthe regions and will provide strong support for the Government&apos;sregional policies.    While they relate essentially to the trunk road system outside towns and cities they recognise the need forcomplementary improvements on principal roads, particularly in urban areas.   They are a major element in the long term strategy for transport as a whole - a strategy which will take full account ofthe future development of rail and air transport in this country.Both these forms of transport are, and will continue to he, essentialcomponents of our transport system, but, despite the growth of air transport, the introduction of new freight and passenger services on the railways and technological development in both these andother forms of transport, the demands of road traffic will continueto ^rov/.   Unless the capacity of the road system is expanded to dealv/ith existing and future traffic demands, road congestion and the associated economic loss will also increase. I3.    The proposals in this paper relate only to England.   Proposalsfor roads in Scotland and Wales have been set out in the white papers &quot;Scottish Roads in the 1970s&quot; (Cmnd 3953) published in March.1969 and &quot;Wales:    The Way Ahead&quot; (Cmnd 3334) published in July 1967.THE BACKGROUND TO THE PRESENT proposals.    In the past 10 years traffic on inter-urban trunk roads andmotorways has more than doubled.    In 1960 the total was 10,000 millionvehicle miles:    now it is 21,000 million vehicle   miles.   With risingnational production, goods vehicles run one fifth more miles than in^960.   But the biggest increase has come from private cars.    In 1960some 5-1 million private cars were licensed in Great Britain;    nov;there are well over 11 million.-2- /5CONF5DENTIAL
5,    as personal incomes and living standards continue to rise, more people who cannot at present afford cars will be able to own them,and to enjoy the freedom and mobility they give.   by 1s85 there couldoe 20 million private cars in use.- now one household in twohas at least one cor.   by 1985 it could be two out of every three.Only then will the rate of growth in car ownership begin toslacken and the rate of growth of total road traffic start to ease.6.    since 1964 the annual rate of expenditure on road building hasdoubled:    it now stands at about  1 million a day.   over the sameperiod the mileage of motorways in use in england and wales hasalso more than doubled and is now over 600 miles.   the target of1,000 miles will be met by about the end of 1972.   In the sameperiod the mileage of all-purpose, dual carriageway trunk roads inEngland alone has increased to 850 miles and by the end of 1972there will be over 1,000 miles in use with many more under con-struction.7.    For many years traffic has been rising faster than the provisionof new road capacity to meet it.   but the continuing expansion ofthe effort on road building, and the forecast of some slackening inthe rate of growth of traffic in the late 1970s and 1980s, does nowoffer the possibility of first checking and then progressivelyeliminating the congestion on our trunk road system.   it is this possibility that the government plans to turn into a reality./THE GREEN
c;s GREEK PAPER PROPOSALSq    She Green Paper, &quot;Roads for the Future&quot;, proposed for discussioanew strategy based on an assessment of inter-urban needs in the1970s and early 1980s.   This, it was estimated, would cost about 2,250 Million (:;2,470 million at 1970 prices).   The strategy had;:ree main elements:-a. to concentrate a substantial part of resources for newroad construction on the comprehensive improvement of anational network of trunk routes to which all importantcentres of population - existing and projected -would or could easily be connected.   Many would be constructed asmotorways:    all would be to dual-carriageway standard.   a map of a possible network was presented for discussion;b. to supplement this with a continuing and complementaryprogramme of individual improvements on other trunk roadsnot justifying comprehensive improvement, and improvedlinks to the national network; andc. to develop these proposals for inter-urban roads within atotal strategy for road development which would allow theproportion of total resources available for road building in. &apos;towns and cities to increase progressively over the period.DISCUSSIONS AND FURTHER ANALYSIS SINCE THE GREEN papers-   Public response to the Green Paper was excellent.   Commentswre received from nearly 300 organisations and individuals.   the concept of the comprehensive development of a national network wasiidely welcomed.    General comments centred mainly on the resources&apos;0 be devoted to road building, the time Within which the strategycould be achieved and the parallel need for increasing expenditureDurban roads.   Detailed comments centred on suggestions foraWitions to the proposed network.
,   confidential10.  The Government has examined carefully the comments received andhas assessed all the proposals for additions to the network,as well as testing a number of alternatives.   Particular attention has been paid to&quot;the comments received from all the regional economic Planning Councils.   The national traffic model described inthe Appendix to the Green Paper proved particularly valuable at thisstage in forecasting the pattern of long distance traffic on alternative routes in the network.   Development of the model foruse in measuring the total benefits arising from complete networksis continuing.   Forecasts obtained from the model have beenconplemented by detailed examination of the existing and futuretraffic on individual routes and of their economic justification.The relationship of the network to regional development and the impact of special factors such as the seasonal needs of holidaytraffic have also been further studied, particularly on routes inthe South-West and to the East Coast.   Care has also been taken toensure that the network will assist the effective utilisation of port and airport facilities.11.   These studies have strengthened the Government *s belief in the concept of comprehensive improvement of a primary network of trunk roads:   hut they have also shown that it should be slightly different from and larger than that proposed in the Green Paper.   TheGovernment has also re-examined the relationship between the forecastincreases in road traffic, the improvement of the trunk road systemgenerally and the increased capacity which is needed to carry the prospective traffic.   They have concluded that if the expanded net-work could be completed w...thin the next 15 to 20 years, together witha programme of work on other trunk roads of about twice the sizeenvisaged in the Green Paper, real congestion on the inter-urban-trunk road system as a whole could be virtually elimincted.

Map &quot;A&quot; enclosed illustrates the enlarged strategic nationalnetwork.   This shows, in blue, routes on which new or comprehensivelyimproved roads will have been provided when existing programmes are complete.   Routes shown in red are additional routes selected for comprehensive improvement to motorway or dual-carriagewaystandards.   Together these routes will form the primary .strategicnational network.13.  This network corresponds largely with the proposals in the green Paper but a number of routes suggested during publicconsultations or as a result of detailed re-examination have beenfound to justify comprehensive improvement   and have been added.They are:(a) Calder Valley Road; &apos;(b) A2 from M2 to Dover;(c) M6-Brownhills (A5) J(d) Alcester-Solihull;(e) A49 V/hitchurch-Warrlngton;(f) A17 Kings Lynn-Nevark (replacing the Kings-.Lynn-Peterborough route tentatively suggested in the green paper);(g) A61    Alf ret on-Shef field,.H. Five other routes may well justify inclusion but more detailed investigation is needed before this can be decided. They are shownxn red dotted lines on the map and are:-&apos; 7(a)
CONFIDENTIAL(a) a route from Bristol to Southampton;(b) a new route from Swindon to the Hilton Keynes area viaOxford;(c) the improvement and possible trunking of the route fromthe A18 at Brigg to Lincoln;    (the whole road networkto serve South Humberside is at present being studiedand final decisions must await the outcome of that.i nv e ctigat ion.)(d) the continuation of the South Coast route from Brightonto Dover;(e) A6 Leicester - Kettering.15,   Two other routes are also shown in dotted linos for special reasons.   The first is a route from the M1 to Harwich:    such aroute   will certainly be needed in the network   hut its general line cannot be decided until the South East Joint Planning Study hasbeen completed.    The second, that part of Ringway 3 in the G1C area,need to take account of the Greater London Development Planinquiry. j16.   The cost of this revised and extended network is estimated to .be about  2,000 million (at 1970 prices) compared with the figureof about  1,750 million for the Green Paper network,17.   This network is based on the boat estimate that can be made atpresent of the ^pattern of future development during the 1970s and1980s,   As comprehensive regional strategies are further developed the network may need to be modified or supplemented to take account,for example, of major new locational decisions such as those arisingfrom the llumherslde and Seyernside studies, the work of the SouthSast Joint Planning Study and the Roskill Commission on the third london Airport.    Seen in the context of the whole network, however,suck changes are likely to be few and are more likely to affect the-7- / )    .    %/priority
priority and timing of schemes &quot;than to change the strategic networkradically.ROADS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT13,   It is emphasised that the network illustrated in Llap &quot;A&quot;represents only one part of the overall inter-urban strategy.   the green Paper suggested, in addition, the provision of  650 million for schemes on other roads not justifying comprehensive improvementto dual carriageway standards.   After a careful review of theactual capacity and forecast traffic on every section of trunk road which will not itself form part of, or be replaced by, routes inthe primary network it is estimated that the amount required fortiiis complementary programme in order virtually to eliminate realcongestion on these roads is about twice this amount,    say 1,400 million at 1970 prices. .19.   This complementary programme of work will comprise;-(a) the  progressive improvement of roads not in the primarynetwork to the standard necessary to cater adequately for futuretraffic demands.    In some cases improvement to good qualitysingle carriageway will prove sufficient;    in others, wheretraffic demands ore heavier, lengths of dual carriageway will beprovided.   Sometimes the improvements will be on theexisting alignment, sometimes on a completely new line;-(b) provision of new and improved links to the primary networkfrom centres, of population and industry;(c) schemes to relieve those sections of the early motorwaynetwork, for example parts of M1 and 1,14f which by the early &apos;1980s are likely to be seriously overloaded.-8- g /20.
20.  As stated in the Green Paper, new and improved roads substantiallyreinforce the major measures the Government are taking to ensure abetter balance in economic development.    In their various Reportsthe Regional Economic Planning Councils lay particular stress on theimportance of strategic road communications and the manner inivhich the 1000 mile motorway programme is already assisting thedevelopment of the regions.    In drawing up the new primary network,full account has been taken of this important consideration so thatthe network will give further support to planning, development through-out the country including the specific needs of the Hew Towns.But apart from the primary network,  the individual improvements on other r^ads and, more particularly, the provision of improved roadlinks between the main network and those areas where existingcommunications are inadequate will give additional support to such areas and so help them to develop their full economic potential.New and improved inter-urban principal roads will also hove animportant role to play in developing regional communications.    Over 200 million worth of such principal road schemes are now in preparationBWIROMENTj AND AMENITY21.  The routes shown in the Map &quot;A&quot; are entirely diagrammatic and thelines finally adopted for roads could be significantly different,-io one need fear that the inclusion of a route in the strategy inam; way prejudges the eventual line of a road.    The selection and establishment of actual lines for roads &quot;will follow normalstatutory procedures and will be open to objection in the usual way.22.   In selecting routes for new and improved roads full account;71-U be taken of environmental and amenity questions including the conservation of historic areas.   New roads do improve the totalenvironment although, inevitably, amenity is reduced in some areas andi0r oouie people.    The aim will be to safeguard and, indeed, to/enhance
enhance both amenity and environment to the maximum possible ex bent.Tioad plans will be most carefully co-ordinated with localauthorities&apos; development plans, use will he made wherever possible&apos;&apos;of derelict land and, wherever it proves practicable and economic,suitable material from unsightly waste tips will be utilised in theactual construction of roads.TLIIHG- AND COST23.   The Green Paper envisaged completion of the primary networkbetween 1982 and 1987.   The network now proposed is more extensiveand the total cost of the overall plan, including the complementaryprogramme of work on other trunk roads, is substantially higherthan that forecast in the Green Paper.   As stated above, the aim willbe to complete this extended strategy within 15 to 20 years from now.24.   Taking into account the outstanding cost of completing thepresent programme,. the total amount to be spent on inter-urbantrunk roads in England within the 15-20 year period from 1970 willbe over  4,000 million.25.   The new inter-urban strategy marks the beginning of a new phasein the planning and development of our road system but there willbe no discontinuity or hiatus in this planning nor any radical changein the machinery for implementing&apos;it.   Already some  900 million worth of schemes both on the primary routes and elsewhere, selected becausethey justified the highest priority, are being investigated and prepared.   These are reflected in Map &quot;B? which shows the presentposition on the development of the motorway and trunk road network.   &apos;Some  110 million worth of the scheme so far announced ror preparationare on non-strategy routes leaving many more still to be selected./Many-10-CONFIDENT5AL
CONFIDENTIAL-any schemes have already been transferred from the preparationpool into the firm programme and will start this year and next.Others will be added progressively to the preparation pool andsubsequently transferred to the firm programme, reflecting thedevelopment of the programme as a whole to conform to the newstrategy.    The relative priorities for schems within the strategyaill be settled as planning and programming proceeds.    The intention is to retain sufficient flexibility of choice on the priority of individual routes and schemes to enable full account to be taken of future development in national, regional and local planning.    the primary consideration will continue to be the economic benefits to be derived from reduction of congestion and accidents but dueweight will be given, in determining priorities, to the need tosupport economic development in all regions.URBAN ROADS26.   The timing and priorities for improvement of inter-urban roadsmust also be considered against the pressing and growing need todeal with congestion in our towns and cities and the environmentalproblems to which it .gives rise, and to provide adequate links between the inter-urban and urban networks.    The solution to theseformidable and complex problems are far from simple.   Much can betone by strengthening public transport and by measures of traffic management, but improvements in urban networks are often a pre-requisite to diverting through traffic away from residential andamenity areas and enabling traffic to move easily from city centres and on to the inter-urban network.   Solutions vary from town totown and have to be seen in the context of each town&apos;s comprehensive plan for physical and environmental management and development.It is therefore not possible to deal with the urban road programme/in thel -11-CONFIDENTIAL
in the same way as the inter-urban although the relationship between the two is, of course, very important.   It is however theGovernment&apos;s intention, as suitable schemes are brought forward bylocal authorities, progressively to change the balance and prioritiesof exp mdi cure within the total road programme between inter-urban and urban investment.   Now rather less than 4-0/- of the total programme is spent on urban roads.    The Government envisages thatthis proportion will need to rise to well over half the total bythe 1930s.SUMAHY27.   This Paper gives an account of the Governmenfs appraisal of current and future traffic levels on inter-urban trunk roads andthe road construction and improvement that would be needed to cater for them.   On a realistic assessment of the resources likely to beavailable for roads as the economy grows the Government has decidedthat its target for the future will be to complete the expanded inter-urban programme outlined in this paper within the next 15-20 years -and at the same time progressively to increase the urban programme.Actual progress over a period of this length must depend on howeconomic conditions generally develop, and the programme itself andthe priorities within it must be reviewed from time to time as newsituations arise and new information on major developments, trafficlevels and new techniques become available.28.   The inter-urban programme will be considerably larger than thatvisualised in the Green Paper.   The network of strategic routes willbe somewhat larger and the complementary programme of individualimprovements will be about double that proposed earlier.   This muchexpanded programme will take rather longer to complete than theproposals set out in the Green Paper but much of the primary networkwill be provided within the period originally envisaged.CONFIDENTIAL /29.-12-
29.  With the Government&apos;s new target we can now look forward bythe end ox the 1980s to an inter-urban trunk road system wherecapacity has doubled (compared with a ?0$ increase in traffic) andon which traffic can travel freely, safely and without frustrationand congestion.    If economic conditions are favourable it may bepossible to achieve this earlier.-13-
