DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ government(70) 65 COPY NO 6321 May 1970CABINETAIRCRAFT INDUSTRY:  CONCORDENote by the Minister of technology. The Cabinet decided at its meeting on 11 December 1969(CC(69) 60th Conclusions, Minute 4) that the development of Concordeshould be continued until the end of June 1970 when the position wouldbe reviewed,    I had accordingly arranged to meet M. Mondon, theFrench Minister of Transport, on 16 June, and in the normal wayI would have sought the guidance of my colleagues on the line I shouldtake at that meeting,2. In the circumstances I propose to write to M. Mondon in theterms of the attached draft, which has been cleared with the Attorney-General, asking that our meeting should be postponed until after theElection,    I have in mind a date about the middle of July.    This would allow officials time to prepare papers and for the Cabinet to review the project.    In the meantime I propose that the development programme should continue and the present production authorities should be extendedas necessary to hold the position until our review can take place.    Noauthorities to start the manufacture of further production aircraft or theordering of long-dated materials for later batches of aircraft would begranted in this interim period.    This accords with the wishes of theFrench Government,3,        I seek the agreement of my colleagues to proceeding on the lines proposed,a w bMinistry of Technology SWT21 May 1970
