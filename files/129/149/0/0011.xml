&quot; DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT64C(7Q) 51 COPY NO14 April 1970CABINETLESOTHOMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affair a1. It was decided at our meeting on 26 March (CC(70) 14thConclusions, Minute 2) that the Cabinet would v/ish to give furtherconsideration to the questions of recognition and the resumption of aid in Lesotho after the Easter Parliamentary R.recess.    I attach an annex summarising the background to the situation and also the mainrecent developxaents,INTERNAL2. There are disturbing features about the internal scene.    no steps have yet been taken to restore democratic constitutional government?main Opposition leaders have been Imprisoned; and there have been manyugly reports of beatings of and pressures on individuals, and arbitrarydischarging of civil servants.    There have been incidents in various partsof the country, the most serious being that of the weekend of 4-5 Aprilresulting in some 100 deaths in all, mostly of diamond diggers who had attacked company camps and police posts in the north-eastern mountainousareas.    The police have, however, managed to contain all thesedisturbances, and our High Commissioner^ latest assessment isthat whilst further gang attacks in outlying areas are possible, thepolice are likely to be able to continue to preserve internal securitygenerally.3, Over the period of about 11 weeks since his ^oup1, Chief Jonathanhas thus been able to exercise effective control over the greater part of theterritory and command the obedience of the mass of the population.    In thisrespect, our High Commissioner assesses that Jonathan has met ourcriteria for recognition, and that the recent disturbances in the diamondarea do not necessitate a change in this view.    Since our policy has been based on our normal recognition criteria, we have deliberately refrained from laying down any political conditions for recognition or resumption of aid, which could be represented as interference in Lesotho&apos;s internal affairs.    We have, however, taken every opportunity that offered of getting over to Chief Jonathan through private channels the need for
compromise which would create a more stable political situation and facilitate a return to constitutional government.    These pressures havebeen reinforced by the advice of Lesotho civil servants and others, againstthe background of alarm caused by the financial consequences of the suspension of our aid, and have led Jonathan to open discussions with opposition party leaders with the aim of negotiating some kind of coalition government, at least as an interim measure.    An announcement made late on 8 April indicates that Jonathan and the leaders of the other three mainparties, including Mokhehle, have agreed to hold a round-table conference to discuss the prevailing situation and the future.    They have called forsolutions to be worked out domestically and not by outsiders, and havealso dissociated themselves from the use of any violence.    Jonathanannounced that the purpose of the discussions would be to try to forma national government which would assist in working out a new constitution to be put before the nation for approval.RECOGNITION4. We are therefore in a situation in which:-a.       it is increasingly difficult, after Jonathan has successfullysustained himself for nearly 3 months, to pretend that our normalcriteria for recognition are not met: and h,       there are encouraging developments in Lesotho (though it isstill to be established whether the agreement between the political parties has been willingly reached and is likely to be honoured)which may create an acceptable opportunity for the resumptionof normal dealings,5.        I therefore believe we should now take the necessary preliminarymeasures to clear the way for a decision on the resumption of normalrelations, possibly at short notice, according to developments.    Thismeans as a first step informing Sir Seretse Ilhama, entirely confidentially,of our views, leaving him enough time to comment.    In a conversationabout his latest message to the Prime Minister, Sir Seretse indicated toour High Commissioner that, whilst he hoped that pressures could be kepton Jonathan and that some &quot;deus ex machina&quot; would emerge, he realised that the passage of time made more difficult the avoidance of recognition,I believe, therefore, that - particularly in the light of the latest indication of possible political compromise in Lesotho - President Khama willunderstand that we feel we must be ready to move on soon, to a resumptionof relations,aid. Since the end of January there has been no contact with the Lesothoauthorities on aid matters.    New recruitment of technical assistancepersonnel has been halted (although 89 Overseas Service Aid Schemeofficers and 4 technical assistance officers remain in post);  requests
for training have teen held in abeyance;  and claims for payments due toLesotho amounting to just over  1 million have been returned to the Lesothoauthorities.    Three research schemes, normally financed from Britishresearch funds paid through the Lesotho Government and whose benefitsmay be expected to extend beyond Lesotho, have been reduced to a care and maintenance basis only and are being kept in existence by means of direct payments through the British High Commission to the expatriateofficers in charge.    V7e have refused to receive Chief Jonathan1 s acceptanceof a new 3-year offer of budgetary and development aid, made last december and intended to come into effect on 1 April 1970, and we have made it clearthat this offer is in suspense.7. If recognition is accorded it will be open to us to resume an aid programme to Lesotho.    The exact form and extent of such a programmev/ill depend on the policies and programmes of the Lesotho Government andon its administrative capacity.    If the new Government continues with the plans and policies of the pre-coup administration an early resumption of our aid programme should not be difficult since it was against those plans and policies that our suspended programme was drawn up.    If however the plans and policies of the newly recognised Lesotho Government should differsignificantly from the earlier ones, we should have to examine the situationin depth.G. We should also need to consider carefully the administrativecapacity of the new Government.    In this context an important consideration is the quality and morale of the Civil Service.    These have been adversely affected by dismissals by the Jonathan regime and by threats.    In the eventof a national (i. e. all-party) Government being formed we could expect tosee an end to political bias in Civil Service appointments and from thispoint of view early resumption of aid could be more simply and moreconfidently effected than if recognition took place in advance of any positive move towards a national Government.    It may well be necessaryin either set of circumstances to send a small team of officials to Lesothoto examine the situation in detail.9. The Minister of Overseas Development has seen and agreed thismemorandum in draft.RECOMMENDATION10.       I invite my colleagues to agree that once we have explained our vie &apos;Sto President Rhama on the above lines, in a message from the Primeiviinister, I should thereafter decide at the most appropriate time in thelight of developments, when to instruct our High Commissioner in Maseruto take the necessary steps to indicate a resumption of relations.m s foreign and Commonwealth Office SW1B April 1970
ANNEXLESOTHO:    BACKGROUND NOTEInternalWhen Chief Jonathan on 30 January suspended theconstitution of Lesotho and, in his own words, &quot;seizedpower&quot; following the apparent defeat of his party in thegeneral election, we made it clear that the future ofBritish/Lesotho relations would have to be examined andthat our normal criteria for recognition would be applied,Meanwhile, we ceased to communicate with the Lesothoauthorities on a Government to Government basis.   the criteria for recognition are that the Government should enjoy with a reasonable prospect of permanence effective control over much the greater part of the territory ofthe state concerned and the obedience of the mass ofthe population.   There is a margin for political apprecia-tion in deciding whether the criteria are met.   But once they are met there is a legal obligation to recogniseand recognition does not necessarily imply approval ofthe regime recognised.2. Chief Jonathan&apos;s action caused widespread resent-ment in Lesotho but the leaders of the opposition, theBasutoland Congress Party, who were themselves imprisoned,instructed their followers to avoid violence.   This hasobviously assisted the police to maintain control.During the first eight weeks after the coixp, sixteenpeople were kil?ed in a number of incidents.   There werefourteen more deaths in a gang fight between Governmentand Basutoland Congress Party supporters continuing over two days at Easter.   A few days later, free-lancediamond diggers in the remote Kao area attacked miningcompany camps and police stations.   Their primarilyeconomic grievances against the Government - for reducing- 1 -
the area available to then by granting concessions tomining companies - were fanned by the local BasutolandCongress Party leaders.   Some hundred or more diggers were killed in two operations by the police, whose own casual-ties were negligible.   The latest reports suggest thatthe Kao diggers are no longer a threat to the regime inthe short term.   The effect of these operations on therest of the country remains to be seen.3o        While the regime has remained in control ofLesotho, it has added to its unpopularity by arbitrarydismissals of civil servants thought to be supporters ofthe Basutoland Congress Party, and by the use of intimidate-tion and violence in seeking evidence of electoral irreg-ularities by the opposition, in order to justify the seizure of power.   These excesses, encouraged by certain ministers, were checked to some extent by Chief Jonathanpersonally, and in respect of violence by the fourteenBritish officers in the Lesotho police.   The latter also have done much to keep the police united and effective and thus to maintain control of internal security,h.        After the coup, Chief Jonathan announced the&quot;technical&quot; abdication of King Moshoeshoe because of hisinterference in politics, and the regime&apos;s intention tobring in an entirely new constitution.   Opposition fromthe College of Chiefs, however, prevented Chief Jonathanfrom deposing the King.   Instead he has come to an agree-ment with the King by which the latter has gone intotemporary and apparently voluntary exile in TheNetherlands.   The College of Chiefs approved this arrange-ment and the appointment of the Queen as Regents   In viewof the King&apos;s long standing hostility to Chief Jonathanand his propensity for intrigue, his departure with theapproval of the majority of the Chiefs has probably on balance strengthened the position of the regime, although- 2 -
it is said &quot;bo have caused some discontent among the ord-inary people.5.        Chief Jonathan and his Ministers have been showingincreasing concern at our action in withholding recogni-tion, and the consequential interruption of aid.   Lesothoofficials have been pressing them to take steps whichwould make it easier for the British Government to resumerelations.   We have ourselves been inhibited in exercis-ing direct influence on Jonathan and his colleagues by our policy of not introducing political considerationsinto our recognition criteria and the grant of aid,which would have represented interference in the affairs of an independent country.   But whenever the opportunityhas occurred, we have used private channels to convey toChief Jonathan and his Ministers that they should cometo some compromise with the opposition and announce a programme for a return towards constitutional government.It seems clear that these and similar pressures fromothers has led the regime to consider seriously thepossibility of bringing members of the oppcsition partiesinto some form of coalition government.    It has now been announced that Chief Jonathan and the leaders of the other three political parties have agreed to a conference todiscuss the future of Lesotho, and have foresworn viol-ence.   Chief Jonathan, commenting on this announcement,said that the discussion would be &quot;with a view to form-ing a national government which will assist me and my- 3 -
Council of Ministers in working out a new constitution which will he put before the nation for approval&quot;.South African attitude6.        The South African Government has, for a longtime, regarded Mr. Ntsu Mokhehle, leader of theBasutoland Congress Party, as under communist influence and a menace;    and would undoubtedly have preferredChief Jonathan&apos;s Party to win the election.   On theother hand, we have had reports that Chief Jonathan&apos;sSouth African advisers in Maseru argued hotly with himto seek to dissuade him from the action he proposed toannul the elections and seize power,7,        The Seuth African Government was embarrassedclearly enough by Chief Jonathan&apos;s actions but has puta good face on it and has stated that normal business with the Government of Lesotho will continue.   The south africans have not in fact been seen to do anything whichcould be described as improper or interventionist inLesotho,8, The two potential dangers or embarrassments whichthe South African Government no doubt sees are:-(a)    a pressing request from Chief Jonathan fora subvention to replace British aid and;- h -
(b)    a serious deterioration in the security situationleading to a request from Chief Jonathan for theSouth Africans to send police support.It is likely that the South African Government would go to considerable lengths to avoid acceding to either request.9,     It would suit the South African Government best if some government under Chief Jonathan were to emerge as the reasonable, respectable and recognised government of Lesothowith effective control cf the country and no serious opposition there.Theinvolvement &amp;f Sir Seretse Khama10.     Very shortly after the suspension *sf the constitution in Lesotho it became evident that the Betswana Governmentwere particularly concerned abs-ut the situation.Sir Seretse Khama was anxious lest the world would judgeBotswana and other newly independent African ,nations by what had happened in Lesotho, and concerned about the effectsa.f instability of a kind that would seriously increase therisk cf overt South African intervention.     The BotswanaGovernment has,  cf course, a special interest because of the close links existing between the three former High commission territories, f*r example the joint University.      On 5 FebruarySir Seretse at our suggestion addressed all CommonwealthAfrican Heads of State/Government suggesting that they^should support efforts he proposed to promote an earlyvisit to Lesotho by the Commonwealth Secretary-General.11.     On 9 February a message from Sir Seretse Khama was delivered to Chief Jonathan proposing that the lattermight invite the Commonwealth Secretary-General to Maseruto assist in an early return to constitutionality.Chief Jonathan&apos;s response held *ut no prospect that theLesotho Government would fall in with Sir Seretse&apos;suggestions.- 5 -
12.     In general, while some of the African leadersapproached by the Botswana President responded in friendly and co-operative terms, none showed any inclination tointerfere in Lesotho&apos;s internal affairs.     This attitude was underlined at the last meeting of the Organisation of african Unity at Addis Ababa in March when the LesothoDelegation took its seat unchallenged.13.     Sir Seretse Khama in his last letter to the PrimeMinister,  and more particularly in discussion of his letter with tne high Commissioner in Gaborone, has shownthat while he is still hoping that we will maintain pressure on Jonathan, and that he has hopes that Jonathan might takepractical steps to restore legality if this pressure ismaintained,  realises the limitations on the results that ouractions might have and understands that the question of recognition would eventually have to be faced.Other considerations1h,     Apart from the question of aid, indefinite delay in recognition could cause difficulties in other respects.The Ministry of Defence is responsible for paying pensionsat the rate of over  25?000 a quarter to ex-members of the african Auxiliary Pioneer Corps and to the dependents ofdeceased members.     These payments have been made throughthe agency of the Lesotho Government and owing to the numberof payments involved there is no other practicable method.A hold-up in such payments would cause hardship to personswho fought for us In the last war ana would give rise to serious public criticism.15.     There is also a difficulty ever the replacement ofour High Commissioner at Maseru, which is due.      his successor cannot be accredited to a regime which we donot recognise.- 6 -
