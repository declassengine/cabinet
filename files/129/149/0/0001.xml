rfilS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y*S GOVERNMENT)C(70) 41COPY NO.   g g3rd March. 1970CABINETSALARIES OF CHAIRMEN AND MEMBERS OF nationalised industry BOARDSMemorandum by the Lord Privy seal i attach a copy of a report by the Chairman of the official committee on Nationalised Board Salaries setting out the considerations which bear upon a decision whether or not to implement Stages 2 and 3 ofthe salary increases recommended in Report No. 107 of the National board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI); and suggesting how the Board*srecommendations might be implemented in detail.2.      In my view paragraphs 4-7 of the Report set out very fairly thearguments for proceeding at least to the implementation of Stage 2 on1st April.    In particular:-(i) It cannot logically be maintained that considerations of incomes policy rule out Stage 2 of the recommended date when the NBPIitself proposed this date a year ago and we now have a moreflescible incomes policy and a steadily improving economic :position,(ii) All the arguments both of equity and of management (i. e, inrelation to the effective manning of top posts in the nationalised industries) strongly favour the earliest possible implementation of the outstanding increases.3,      On the other hand I recognise that the impact on popular opinion of increases of up to 10. 6 per cent for board members and 16, 7 per cent forchairmen could well be unfortunate whenever they are implemented and whatever the merits of the case for doing so; and that this consideration might be thought a strong argument for doing nothing about Stages 2 and 3,at least until they can be subsumed in the first review of the Special panel of the Commission for Industry and Manpower which can be expected in1971.
4.      It is a matter of judgment whether the impact of these increases would be more damaging at a time when a strict incomes policy is being more or less successfully applied (as was broadly the case last April at thetime of the NBPI Report); or when a looser policy is being less successfullyapplied and large settlements are the order of the day - as at present.    Itis certainly difficult to be sure that there will ever be a less unfavourablemoment than the present to implement the second stage of these increases which have long had the blessing in principle of the Governments advisory body on incomes policy and of the Government itself.    I fear therefore thatif we do not proceed to Stage 2 on 1st April, we shall in effect be going back on our acceptance of the Report and denying the principle thatnationalised board salaries should be fixed on a fair and rational basis.And in doing so we should not be solving the present presentationaldifficulties; on the contrary, they would grow steadily.    Nor would it,in my view, be acceptable to refer the question of Stages 2 and 3 to theSpecial Panel.    This would be to reject the recommendations of the NBPI(having once accepted them).    It would then be extremely difficult toestablish confidence in the independence and efficacy of the Special Panel.Nor should we ignore the danger that if we decide not to implement Stage we shall be exposed to damaging criticism from more informed publicopinion for having acted against the interests of the nationalised industries and the advice of the NBPI for reasons of Bhort-term expediency.5.      My conclusion is that in spite of the very real difficulties there are equally serious objections to not carrying out the NBPI recommendations and that in fact the balance of advantage lies in favour of implementing the increases as quickly as possible.    Of the choices open to us (as set outin paragraph 8 of the attached report) I would in principle favour (c),i. e. to implement Stage 2 on 1st April, 1970 and Stage 3 on 1st April, 1971.This would have the advantage over course (b), (i. e. the implementation of stage 2 on 1st April, 1970, leaving the timing of Stage 3 for furtherconsideration) of minimising uncertainty in the nationalised industries;and, by avoiding the need for two announcements, it would reduce the total amount of public attention given to the increases and avoid a repetitionnext year of our present problem.    Even course (c) is less than whollysatisfactory in relation to the review to be conducted by the Special Panelin 1971 and my colleagues may perhaps feel that we ought to consider thepossibility of a variation of course (c) under which Stage 3 would bebrought forward to, say, 1st January, 1971.    On the other hand, if theCommittee felt that any commitment to Stage 3 would be unacceptable, Iwould regard course (b) as acceptable although I would regard this as theminimum necessary to avoid the charge that the Government was rejecting the NBPI recommendations.6.      As regards detailed implementation, I think it is satisfactory that officials have been able to devise what appears to be a workable scheme(Annex A of the attached report) for implementing the NBPFs proposals andI do not consider that the modifications proposed (summarised inparagraph 12 of the Report) run counter to the NBPPs basic aims.    Im 2**
suggest therefore that the proposals at Annex A to the Report should betaken by the Departments with responsibilities for the nationalised industries (in consultation with the Civil Service Department) as a basis fordiscussion with board chairmen, v/hen we have reached our decision ofprinciple on Stages 2 and 3.    We shall of course have to be prepared totake into account any comments they may have; and if any modifications of the proposed arrangements seem to be called for in the light of what they say, I suggest that my Department might be authorised to settle themdirect with the Departments with responsibilities for nationalised industries,in consultation with the Department of Employment and Productivity.7.      I also agree with the proposal in paragraph 13 of the Report that itwould be sensible to give each board member at Stage 2 half the increase heis to receive at Stage 3 and that for this purpose the Minister concerned ineach case should decide, in consultation with my Department, what theappropriate salary for each board member should be at Stage 3.8.      The decisions on these issues will have implications for that on the plowden report (on which I am circulating a separate memorandum -C(70) 40) and it is essential in any view that both should be considered together.9.      I ask my colleagues to agree that we should announce our decisionto implement on 1st April, 1970 the Stage 2 increases for members of nationalised industry boards recommended in NBPI Report No. 107; andthat this announcement should state that the Stage 3 increases recommendedby the NBPI will be paid on 1st April, 1971; and that the detailedimplementation of these increases should be as. set out in paragraphs 11-13of the attached report.    A statement of the increases which would be involved is at Annex B of the attached memorandum.S.Civil Service Department, S.W.I.2nd March, 1970
PeJBS !LM-.Chairraan of the Official Committee,.on nationalised j3oard SaJLariesIn Report No. 107 the national Board for Prices and Incomes(NBPI)   recommended new rates of salary for the Chairmen and members of the boards of the nationalised industries.   As the increases recommended were very substantial, it proposed thatthey should he implemented by stages and suggested the followingpattern for Chairmen and Deputy Chairmen:Previous salaryStage 1: 1 k 1969Stage 21 1 hr 1970StaGe 3: 1 U 1971For Board members it was proposed that the previous salary: range of  7,000 -  9,500 should be raised and widened to  8,000 - 15,000, with an across the board increase of 10 per cent atStar-e 1.2.     The Governments decision, announced in the House of commons by the First Secretary on 3 April 1969 (Hansard Vol 781 Cols659-661) was that the salaries recommended were right inprinciple and should be implemented ?/hen the requirements of incomes policy allowed.     The increases recommended for 1 April1969 would be implemented, as on average they were within the3i per cent per annum ceiling.   The further increases recommendedwould however have to be considered in the light of developments in incomes policy over the next two years.3.     Because of the need to consult board Chairmen before final decisions are taken consideration must be given well before1 April as to how and when Stages 2 and 3 should be implemented.The following analysis of the factors to be taken into account in deciding the date of implementation and the proposals forgiving effect to the NBPI&apos;a   recommendations in detail havebeen agreed generally by the Official Committee   but do notcommitt departments. \ \Group &quot;A&quot; Boards -   &quot;      Q ^M.JL^RS ^Chairmen	Deputy Chairmen	Chairmen	Deputy C.hairmen12,500	10,000	11,000	9,50015,000	12,000	13,000	11,00017,500	1l!-,000	15,000	12,00020,000	16,000	17,000	13,500
rCASE FOR IMPLEMENTATION     SECRETk.     The NBPI clearly took the view last year that if the incomes policy as it then stood were to continue unchanged into 1970and 1971, the implementation of the second and third stageincreases on 1 April 1970 and 1 April 1971 would &quot;be consistent with that policy.   The new incomes policy White Paper is generallyless restrictive than the one in force last year - as witness thesubstitution of the range of 2  per cent - h\ per cent for incomesincreases for the more rigid ceiling of 3i per cent, the factthat there is no longer any reference to staging and the recogni-tion of the part necessarily played &quot;by comparability in thepublic services.   Therefore, having accepted the recommendedStage 3 salaries as right in principle, and having not challengedthe NBPI view that the implementation of Stages 2 and 3 on1 April 1970 and 1 April 1971 was consistent with last year&apos;income policy, the Government could not argue convincingly thatStages 2 and 3 were inconsistent with incomes policy as it now stands.    Indeed it could &quot;be argued that there is a case foradvancing Stage 3 or even for bringing it forward to 1 April 1970.5.     There are moreover strong practical reasons in favour of the implementation of Stages 2 and 3.    In the discussions withnationalised industry chairmen which followed the Government&apos;sstatement of last year, the point was made most strongly that until NBPI recommendations were fully implemented, it would beimpossible to adopt satisfactory salary structures et the levelof senior executives immediately below the board;   until then, theundesirable degree of overlap with the salary range for board members, which was the main reason given by the NBPI for its recommendations, would remain.   The first stage increases for board members have in fact done little to ease the problem ofover-compressed differentials, as they had in most cases to be accompanied by corresponding increases for the senior executivesimmediately below which were themselves long overdue.   For example,the limit for senior executive salaries in the British railways board has been set at  11,500,  although it may be some time beforeanyone reaches that level; and senior executive salaries in theAir Corporations already extend up to  9,000.6.     The main appointments to nationalised industry boards fromthe private sector in the past years have been those to thePost Office Board.    In three cases,  including that of theChairman, the salaries which could be offered proved to be below what the individuals concerned had previously been earning.Fortunately their services were secured notwithstanding.   However,it may well be that their willingness to accept a drop in salarywas to some extent conditioned by the fact that the Governmentwas known to   ave accepted the NBPI&apos;s proposals in principle;and it may be felt, therefore, that there is something of amoral obligation on this account not to delay the implementation of Stages 2 and 3 longer than necessary.    It vyill also benecessary before long to make appointments to two new boards,the British Airways Board and the National Ports Authority.An announcement that Stages 2 and 3 would not be implemented inaccordance with the time t able proposed by the NBPI would clearly be unhelpful in this context.   A further point to beborne in mind is that the continuation of the present situationin which the members of the Board of the British Steel Corporationreceive very much more than the members of even the mostimportant of the other boards in unsatisfactory; it is important to reduce this gap, consistently with general policy, althoughit Y/ill not be closed entirely even at Stage 3.2
/CASE FOR IMPLEMENTATION     SECRETh.     The NBPI clearly took the view last year that if the incomes policy as it then stood were to continue unchanged into 1970and 1971. &quot;the implementation of the second and third stageincreases on 1 April 1970 and 1 April 1971 would he consistent with that policy.    The new incomes policy White Paper is generallyless restrictive than the one in force last year - as witness thesubstitution of the range of 2^ per cent -      per cent for incomesincreases for the more rigid ceiling of 3i Per cent, the factthat there is no longer any reference to staging and the recogni-tion of the part necessarily played by comparability in thepublic services.   Therefore, having accepted the recommendedStage 3 salaries as right in principle, and having not challengedthe NBPI view that the implementation of Stages 2 and 3 on1 April 1970 and 1 April 1971 was consistent with last year&apos;income policy, the Government could not argue convincingly thatStages 2 and 3 were inconsistent with incomes policy as it now stands.

For example,the limit for senior executive salaries in the British railways board has been set at  11,500, although it may be some time beforeanyone reaches that level; and senior executive salaries in theAir Corporations already extend up to  9,000.6.

7.     There are two more general considerations.   Firstly,departments believe that there is an expectation among manynationalised industry board members that the Stages 2 and 3increases are &quot;likely to be implemented in accordance with the timetable proposed by the NBPI.   The board members appreciate, ofcourse, that no commitment has been given;   but the incomes policy argument,  as outlined in paragraph k above, has notescaped them.    If the decision goes against implementation of stage 2 this April, there will therefore be widespread dispdisappointment and very possibly some loss of personnal to theprivate sector.    Given the vast scale of the nationalised industries&apos; operations, any reduction of efficiency due to the poor morale at the top would be a very serious matter.    Thesecond general consideration is that if the NBPI&apos;s proposedtimetable for Stages 2 and 3 is now rejected doubt will be castupon the credibility of the Commission for Industry and Manpower(CIM)  and in particular its &quot;  . 1 ,   . Panel which is to deal withtop level public sector salaries.    This would obviously be most fortunate.8,      In this situation there are four main alternative courses open as regards the timing of further action on the NBPI&apos;srecommendations:(a) notwithstanding the considerations set out inparagraphs h to 7-i. above, to decide againstimplementing Stage 2 on 1 April 1970.(b) to decide to implement Stage 2 on 1 April 1970, butto leave the timing of Stage 3 for further considera-tion.(c) to decide to implement Stage 2 on 1 April 1970 andStage 3 on 1 April 197L(d) to decide to implement Stage 2 on 1 April 1970 andto implement Stage 3 at the same time.9.     In deciding between these alternatives,  it is necessary tobear in mind that the Special Panel of the CIM is expected to begin work upon a general review of all the groups which it covers shortly after it comes into being.   Account must be takentherefore of the possibility that it will publish a reportdealing, inter alia, with nationalised industry board members,as early as the summer of 1971.    Given the Governments acceptanceof the salary levels recommended by the NBPI as right inprinciple, and given that on the incomes side the CIM will bethe successor to the NBPI,  it would clearly be illogical and undesirable to ask the Special Panel to review the correctnessof what the NBPI said.    This must imply that by the time theSpecial Panel begins work, Stage 3 should either have been implemented or have   had an early date firmly set for itsimplementation.   Even so there might be difficulties in that anyfurther adjustments for nationalised industry board members which the Special Panel might recommend would tend to followvery closely upon the implementation of Stage 3; but this problem would be eased if the Special Parv-.&quot;1 could be persuaded to propose a forward-date for their reconnendationn.3SiCHIT
LFgLCTS^ON. OTHLiR GROUPS10.    If the further increases recommended for members of the boards of the main nationalised industries are implemented,  it will benecessary for corresponding increases to be given to members of anumber of other public boards which have always been linked tothe main nationalised industries for salary purposes (eg theWhite Fish Authority, the Commonwealth Development Corporation,Remploy, etc).    It may also be necessary to review the salaries of the Chairmen and members of certain other public boards suchas the Race Relations Board and the British broadcasting corporation where nationalised industry salaries have in the past been a factor taken into account along with other factors.D3i,TAIL;iD IKPIBMMTATION11.    In paragraphs 8h, 86, 91 and 95 of its report the NBPI madea number of suggestions as to the way in which the salary rangeproposed for board members at Stage 3 should be operated.    Centralto the proposals was the concept of personal salary ranges.    Itwas proposed that each board member should be assigned a personalsalary range, with a variation of plus or minus about 20 per centabout its midpoint;    that for the largest (Group A) Boards 12,500 should be the most common midpoint, corresponding to a range of  10,000 -  15,000;    that in the Group B  10,000 shouldbe the most common midpoint corresponding to a range of  8,000- 12,000i    and that progression above the midpoint should beexceptional,    It was also proposed that for board members, Stage should take the form of bringing those people who were below theminimum of their personal salary range up to that figure, while at Stage 3 everyone would be moved to whatever point on his personal salary range was thought appropriate.12.   Annex A to this report sets out our conclusions as to the way in which the system of personal salary ranges might be operated.We consider that while certain aspects of the NBPI&apos;s proposals as they stand would give rise to difficulties,  it should bepossible to avoid these by certain modifications which would notbe inconsistent with the NBPI&apos;s main intentions, namely:(a) We recommend that while Ministers should, as hitherto,always consult board Chairmen about the salaries of individual board members and take their views intoaccount, they must retain the right to take the finaldecision.    (The NBPI had proposed that ministers should &quot;normally be guided&quot; by the advice of boardChairmen:    officials consider that a public commitment on this might be too limiting,).(b) We believe that it will continue to be necessary totake some account of length of (satisfactory) service in determining the progression of board members through their salary ranges. (The NBPI laid the main emphasisupon relating pay to performance, but performance isnot easy to assess at this level, and the value ofincreasing experience is a legitimate factor).(c) We consider that the NBPI&apos;s aim of relating a boardmember&apos;s pay to the weight of his job may In manycases have to be achieved by making his progression
progression through his salary range faster or slower than usual rather than by setting a higher or lowerrange in the first place.    In the more doubtful cases a higher or lower range would be more identifiable,and would thus have to be defended more specifically:there might also be problems if the w ight of a jobchanged).13.   A further problem arises from the NBPITs proposal that thesecond stage increases for board members should consist of bringing them up to the minimum of their personal salary ranges.The groxip A Boards contain a number of members whose salariesare fairly close to 510,000; and  10,000 is of course the highestminimum salary which any Board member can have consistent withthe upper limit of .315,000 and a range of 20 per cent above and below the midpoint.    Therefore the literal application ofthe 3\TBPI&apos;s recommendation would mean that all these members would receive a very small increase, or no increase at all,at Stage 2.     At Stage 3* however, one would in most cases want to give these people, the most experienced and valuable membersof their boards, increases which would bring them well towardsthe midpoint of their range, ie  12,500.    One would thus be giving them a very small increase, followed by quite a large one.Conversely in the case of those board members who are currentlypaid towards the lower end of the range, the pattern would bethe opposite:    quite a large increase at Stage 2, followed atStage 3 &quot;by a very small one.    In neither case does the outcomeseem to be a very happy one.   There seems moreover to be an obvious solution: for the Minister concerned to decide, inconsultation with the Civil Service Department, what salary heenvisages for an individual board member at Stage 3 and then tomove him half way towards it at Stage 2.    It would clearly beas well to treat the Group B Boards similarly, and the systemsproposed would have some advantages there as well.14.   A statement of the percentage increases which would be involved at Stages 2 and 3 on this basis is attached to Annex Bto this report.r^sjjjNs15.   The NBPI report also rcovered the question of pensionprovision.    They suggested in paragraph 102 that Ministers should either leave boards to formulate their own pension arrangements,/t$L4L^j-    or should&quot; alternatively make greater use of the full latitudeSV \ij^2^^   permissible under the Inland Revenue rules if they wished to&quot;T        ^        retain control themselves./ I do not think we ould contemplatecoUirru^u^^   the first of these alternatives.   As to the second, our presentM^-t-o-aj, hkunouja arrangements are in fact very flexible and we have already(sL^^^jdtia-i.   started to make fuller use of the latitude provided by the inland Revenue rules.    The nationalised industry boards are however interpreting the NBPI recommendation as meaning thattheir pension arrangements should be brought up to the fulllimits allowed by the Inl*r &quot; Revenue in every possible respect.This raises some important issues; and a separate paper willbe submitted to Ministers when they have   been fully studied.F G; BURRETTCivil Service DepartmentLONDON SW1 5SECRET
ANNEX a detailed ASPECTS OF THE NBPI PROPOSALS:As stated in the report, the main problems arising out ofthe NBPI&apos;s recommendations on salaries relate to hoard members,where the NBPI proposed (references are to NBPI Report No 107):(a) board members in Group A and B Boards should he givenpersonal pay ronges, depending on the context and responsibility of each job, within the overall limits of  8,000 -  15,000 (paragraph 91);(b) these ranges should he used to allow the pay of eachmanager to be linked with his achievements.    Thenormal expectation should be a progression to the mid-point of the individual^ salary range, providedthat performance is fully up to the expected standard;progress beyond that point should be exceptional andshould recognise outstanding performance.    In no case should the progression depend on age or length ofservice (paragraph 84.) ;(c) in fixing board members&apos; salaries, it should be normal practice for Ministers to be guided by the advice ofthe Chairmen of the boards concerned, which they mightformulate in consultation with the Deputy Chairmen and,where appropriate, part-time members of the board(paragraph 86);(d) personal pay ranges should allow for a variation ofplus or minus about 20 per cent above the mid-point.For Group A Boards, the most common mid-point shouldbe  12,500 and in Group B towards it should be 10,000 (paragraph 91);(e) at ^tage 2, hoard members who do not yet receive theminimum of their new personal salary ranges should bebrought up to that level.   At Stage 3, they should move to the point on the salary ranges appropriate intheir cases at that time (paragraph 95).SALARY RANGES:    GENERAL PRINCIPLES GOVERNING PROGRESSIONDiscussion at official level among the departments with responsibilities for the nationalised industries has shown ahigh degree of agreement that while &quot;linking the pay of eachmanager to his achievements&quot; is unexceptionable as an objective,certain limitations have to be recognised in practice.   At thelevel of board members the assessment of achievement is necessarily imprecise, and it can of course only be a matter ofsubjective judgement.   \r.hile extremes can perhaps he distinguished,there are many hoard members whose service is regarded by all ashighly satisfactory but for whom it would be very difficult to identify any particular levels of achievement at the varyingstages of their appointment. Yet in the case of such members it is
often very desirable to give some salary advancement over thecourse of time in order to recognise the value of increasingexperience, to sustain morale and possibly to reflect and counter-act the increase in an individual&apos;s market value as he becomesbetter known as a result of his position.   One may also want incertain industries with a federal structure to move someone froma functional position on the main board to the Chairmanship afan area board and then back again to the main board, and for thispurpose to provide some financial incentive to make the moves.For these reasons we believe that it is impracticable toattempt to relate salary to assessed achievement and to nothing else.   v.e think it inevitable that the position of individualboard members within their ranges should normally improve withthe length of their service; and that there should be some general understanding,about the rate and extent of the progression whichshould correspond to satisfactory, but not demonstrably outstand-ing, performance.   But we think that the system should beflexible:    where extremes of performance are able to be distinguished, and are sufficiently clear that they will beaccepted by most of those concerned with a particular board, theyshould be recognised by faster or slower progress through the range, and in appropriate cases by progression to the upper halfof the range.   Variation should also be possible in order toprovide incentives to move between area boards, and from area boards to main boards, and in other cases, including those whereit is necessary to respond to market pressures.    Such a system would, it is felt, achieve the main objectives of the NBPIrecommendation, while not conflicting radically with existing practice.The statutory responsibility for determining the remuneration of board members rests with the Minister of the appropriate department, in consultation with the Minister for the CivilService,    There is, of course, no disagreement with the view ofthe NBPI that Ministers should normally be guided in this by theadvice of the Chairmen of the boards concerned, in the sense thatthey are bound to attach great weight to their advice and willin most cases follow it; and the NBPI accepts that Ministers mustbe free to diverge from the advice of Chairmen in some cases.But we think that an explicit acceptance of the NBPI recommenda-tions would in practice make it more difficult for Minister todiverge from the advice of Chairmen when they might wish to, andthus paradoxically be inconsistent with the NBPI1s realintention.   The need to preserve Ministerial freedom of action ismoreover a real one, because it is not impossible, for example,that Chairmen might wish to move the majority of their board members up towards the too of the permitted range to an extent which would undermine its viability at a time when Ministers werenot prepared to contemplate a general raising of the range.   Wetherefore think that the NBPI&apos;s recommendation on this point should be accepted in slightly qualified terms to the effect that ministers will, as hitherto, always consult board Chairmen aboutthe remuneration of individual board members and take their viewsinto account, but that in accordance with their statutoryresponsibilities they must as the NBPI recognised retain theright to make the final decision.
SALARY RANGES:    limits the NBPI proposed that in the Group A Boards,  12,500 shouldbe the most common . mid-point, which corresponds to a range of 10,000- 15,000.   This is of course the highest range consistent with the overriding maximum of  15*000 and a spread of 20 per cent above and below the mid-point, and this seems appropriate in theGroup A Boards.    It would follow from the NBPI&apos; s general concept of personal salary ranges that some board members might be assigned a lower range in recognition of the fact that their jobswere lighter and less responsible than the others.The principle that pay should reflect the weight of a boardmember&apos;s job is undeniably important.   But we do not think it isnecessary to achieve this aim in precisely the way envisaged bythe NBPI,    In the case of the lighter posts on a Group A board the determination of a lower salary range would appear veryinvidious to the individuals concerned, particularly as it seemsvery doubtful whether a salary of lower than  10,000 for any ofthe posts would be justified in terms of what would be paid in private concerns of even approximately comparable size.   Wethink, therefore, that it would be better to take  10,000- 15*000 as the standard salary range in Group A Boards and totake the weight of a member&apos;s 30b into account when consideringthe rate of his progression through the range, and his eligi-bility to proceed to the upper half of it.In Group B Boards the NBPI suggest that  10,000 should bethe most common mid-point, corresponding to a range of  8,000- 12,000.   Here it will be valuable to have the freedom todetermine higher ranges in some cases such as when a member isdesignated as Chief Executive or Deputy Chief Executive of hisorganisation, or for some other reason has a level of responsi-bility which can be clearly seen to be higher than the othermembers of the board to a sufficient extent that they are unlikely to resent his more favourable salary position.   The flexibilityproposed by the NBPI will also be valuable in the case of newappointments where the individual&apos;s previous salary makes the 8,000- 12,000 range inappropriate.   As in Group A Boards,however, we think that in less clear cut cases than these itwould be better to take differences in the levels of responsi-bility into account as one of the factors determining the rate at which a member should progress through the standard range.The advantages would be the avoidance of difficulties if therelative standing of a job were to decrease and the fact that since the relative weight of the jobs would only be one of anumber of factors affecting the salaries given to different board members, the Minister&apos;s judgement of it could not be identifiedand subjected to specific criticism.&quot;NORMAL&quot; RATE OP PROGRESSIONFor Group A Boards, departments consider that the pattern fora board member who gives continued satisfactory service without being outstanding should be appointment at the minimum of the range,  10,000, with a reasonable expectation of an increase ofSICftET
 1,000 after completion of two years service and a further  1,500after completion of seven years service or, in suitable cases, onre-appointment.   For Group B Boards, appointment would be at 8,000 (except where a higher than normal range was agreed), witha reasonable expectation of an increase of  1,000 after completionof two years&apos;  service and a further  1,000 after completion of seven years&apos; service or,  in suitable cases, on re-appointment.In both Group A and B Boards progression above the mid-point wouldbe dependent upon outstanding performance as recommended by the nbpi.    It might however also be allowed in cases where the weightof the job justified exceptional treatment and this had not been reflected in the determination of the salary range for theindividual concerned.ASSIMILATION AT STAGES 2 AMD 3The appropriate rates of salary at Stage 3 will of course haveto be considered in every individual case.   The following tableshowever give a general indication of the sort of increases whichmight occur in the absence of any special factors:GROUP A BOARDSPresent Salary      Stage 3      Increase at Stage 2 		 	8,250	10,000	875	(10.6%)8,800	10, 500	850	( 9.6*)9,350	11,000	825	( 8.8%)9,900	11,500	800	( 8.1%)10,450	12.000	775	( 7.4%)	GROUP B BOARDS		7,700	8, 500	400	( 5.2%)8,250	9,000	375	( 4.5%)8,800	9,500	350	( 5.0%)9,350	10,000	325	( 3.5%)9,900	10,000	50	( 0.5%)10,450	10,450	Nil	( 0.0%)In the case of Group B Boards a fair proportion of those currentlyon the higher rates of salary, for which little or no Increase isshown, would be candidates for personal salary ranges in excessof the normal range of  8,000- 12,000.m 9
Area Board Chairmen are paid as members of Group A boards and they would therefore receive increases on the same lines athose indicated for   ordinary Group A board members.   For area board Deputy Chairmen the NBPI recommended a range of  7,500- 9,500 at Stage 3.   At present all Area Board Deputy Chairmenreceive either  6,900 or  7,150 which suggests the followingpattern for them:Present Salary        Stage 3 Increase at Stage 2   7,1506,9008,0007,500425300(6.0%)1-Q

If all those directlycovered by the proposals are taken together, the increases would amount no average to 9-10 per cent at Stage 2 with a further 8.5-9per cent on the Stage 2 salaries at Stage 3*    These estimates assume that a certain number of higher than normal personal salary rangeswill have to be agreed in Group B boards and also allow for thepossibility of the partial regrading of two boards which is beingproposed by the Ministry of Technology.The total addition to the present annual salary bill by thetime Stage 3 is reached is estimated at just under  200,000.il
