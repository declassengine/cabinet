DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYlS government(70) 55 COPY NO  ^28th April 1970CABINETFINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO PRIVATE INDUSTRY:CODE OF CONDUCTMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury the Minister of Technology^ paper states his views on theconsequences of the legal opinions given to us on Beagle AircraftCompany.    I think that the best way of applying this experience to future proposals for Government financial assistance to private industry would be by defining and acting upon a Code of Conduct.The Industrial Expansion Act2.      A number of important elements in any such code of conductwere dealt with in three papers which were approved by Ministers inthe summer of 1968 in connection with industrial investment schemes which might come forward under the new powers taken in theIndustrial Expansion Act 1968.    These papers set out:-a.     the procedures for inter-departmental consideration ofsuch projects and for their vetting by an advisory committee;h.     the external economic factors to be taken into account in deciding whether to provide finance to projects which arejudged to be in the national economic interest but whichwould not be undertaken on commercial considerations alone;c.     the terms of selective financial assistance by GovernmentDepartments for industrial projects or schemes in theprivate sector.3.      The last of these papers, which was prepared by the treasury in consultation with other interested Departments, although writtenwith particular reference to schemes under the Industrial Expansion Act,was intended to be of wider relevance, and it is of particular interest for the purposes of the present notfe.    It did not set out, however, toembrace fiscal incentives and financial support of a more general character - such as investment grants or the various schemes of1
assistance for Development Area projects - while the arrangementsgovelming the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation^ (1958-59) financialoperations were the subject of separately agreed guidelines.    The main points in the 1968 paper on the terms of selective assistance to private industry can be summarised as follows.4.      The White Paper on Industrial Expansion (Cmnd, 3509) had made it clear that, in an economy such as ours, the role of the Government inselective assistance to the private sector should be that of lender oflast resort.    The new powers taken by the Government would not beused to displace existing sources of finance.    Proposals for assistance would be subject to no less stringent examination than that applied toinvestment in the private sector or the nationalised industries.5.      If a case was established that a scheme was in the national economic interest, but that sufficient finance on suitable terms couldnot be mobilised from other sources, the paper envisaged that theGovernment^ contribution should be as limited, and the terms as hard,as was compatible with the object of the decision to contribute.    Thefollowing possible forms of assistance were discusseds-a.     Loans.    A secured loan or debenture at not less than theGovernment lending rate should be regarded as the norm.D-      Convertible Loans or Debentures.   A loan or debenture withrights of conversion into shares, though not hitherto a normal form of Government financial participation, wouldbe appropriate where projects could stand loan terms andin addition had a prospect of showing a substantial profiton the investment over and above service of the loan.c.      Guarantees.    Government guarantees on funds borrowed inthe private sector should be used only in exceptional cases.They should not be used as a means of enabling otherwiseuncreditworthy companies to raise loan finance.    Lendingwith a Government guarantee is generally unlikely to beattractive to the banks, since such borrowing should carryinterest rates only marginally above the Governmentlending rate.    In practice, therefore, guarantees will normally be applicable to borrowing from sources outsidethe banks; such finance is tantamount to gilt-edged andhas implications for monetary management.    Outside thespecial arrangements for guaranteed fixed- rcfce finance for exports and shipbuilding, the possibility of providing aguarantee should arise only in exceptional circumstanceswhen a direct Government loan might be administrativelyfcxcoyxvwaient or the use of private finance has strongpresentational advantages.2
d. Shareholdings.    As stated in the White Paper on industrial expansion, an object of a Government shareholding incertain projects would be to provide for a return to theExchequer if the profits justified it without imposing too great a burden of fixed-interest debt at the outsst.     In some circumstances this might be achieved by a preferenceshareholding! in others an investment in ordinary sharesmight be more suitable.    In all cases of a substantialGovernment shareholding the Government would require,the right to appoint a Director and, according to the extentof its participation, might require other safeguards also.e. Underwriting of Losses.    The aim in any schemes forGovernment underwriting of possible losses should be toprovide a service which is self-financing oct of premiumincome,f. Launching Aid.    Launching aid takes the form of a Vote-financed Government contribution towards the cost of launching a civil aircraft project, which is recoverable bymeans of a levy on receipts from sales, the amount of the recovery depending on the success of the project.    this type of assistance was mentioned in the paper as of possible use in considering the terms for other special cases,rather than outright grant.g. Grants.    The paper noted that, outside the general schemesof grants (such as investment grants) designed to securecertain broad national objectives, and a limited amoufet of grant finance for particular industries such as shipbuildingto meet losses involved in reorganisation or contraction,grants to individual firms on a selective basis had consistedmainly of assistance towards research and development ortechnological innovation.    In this field, as in the case of launching aid for aircraft, a general aim was to provide forrecovery of the Governments contribution wherever possible,e. g. by a levy on sales or royalty rights.Experience since 19686,      In the event the new powers taken in the Industrial ExpansionAct, 1968 have not been used to anything like the extent which was atone time expected.    The 1958-59, on the other hand, has taken part in an increasing number of operations, and this is no doubt a reason for the limited need for direct Government intervention in particular cases.Government funds have also been channelled through the shipbuilding industry Board, and for Upper Clyde Shipbuilders (UCS) these havenow been supplemented by ad hoc loans from the Ministry of Technology.Funds have also been channeled for particular purposes through, forexample, the National Research Development Corporation (NRDC).3
7.      We have two kinds of case to consider though they are not always easily distinguishables consideration of government assistance for what seems to be a successful venture; and Governmentaid for an enterprise which is, or looks likely to be, in financial difficulties.Assistance to Viable Firms8.      I do not think that anything that has happened requires us toretreat from the principles mentioned above when the Governmentwishes to participate in an apparently satisfactory enterprise, butwe need to exercise a great deal of caution.    We should take whateversteps are possible in particular cases to remove any suggestion thatthe Government are taking upon themselves any responsibility beyond that which any other person engaged in the same degree of participationwould assume.    In particular we should take any opportunity,e. g. when any necessary Bill is before Parliament, to make it clearthat this is the full extent of the Governments liability; we should publish wherever appropriate the fact that the Governments liabilityis limited - if necessary even to the detail of seeing that the documents and notepaper of the company concerned clearly show that it is alimited liability company.    Where it is decided to take an equityholding we should appoint Government directors but we should seek toemphasise they are responsible to the general body of shareholders.We should, before participating, seek legal advice on the extent of the liabilities that we might incur and we should consider carefully whatfinancial information we shall require from the company so as toensure that the maximum amount of the Governments commitment was known and was finite.    In particular the company should be requiredto undertake, in some appropriate form, to notify the government when its total indebtedness, including trade credit, reached apredetermined figure.    This early warning of the possible laterapproach of insolvency should enable the Government to decide freelywhat course to adopt in the circumstances than prevailing.9.      We should make it plain in some general statement at an appropriate time that Government participation in commercial enter-prises does not mean the acceptance of any kind of obligation going beyond what the law requires^    This is not to rule out the possibility that in particular circumstances, should an enterprise have failed,contrary to expectations, we might decide there was a case for ouraccepting some ex gratia responsibility to employees and possibly even to creditors; though in general I am opposed to our doing so since thiswould inevitably lead to a situation in which we would be assumed toaccept a general responsibility.Where the Firm&apos;s Future is Uncertain10.      The advice we have had on the Beagle and UCS cases is ofmore direct relevance when the Governments intervention is in thenature of a rescue operation or where, following participation in whatwas expected to be a viable enterprise, the firm&apos;s position deteriorates,4

The advice we have had on the Beagle and UCS cases is ofmore direct relevance when the Governments intervention is in thenature of a rescue operation or where, following participation in whatwas expected to be a viable enterprise, the firm&apos;s position deteriorates.4
Our aim should be to take decisions in the light of a full and informedappreciation of the situation and of the implications for the future ofthe action proposed.    In particular we should consider not only the direct cost of assistance to the firm but the size of the total liabilitythe Government might have to meet.    There should be specificdecisions at each stage, each taken in the light of legal advice as tothe degree of further involvement that may arise.    I do not think it possible to lay down rules cf general application.    The safeguardssuggested above for participation in viable enterprises should all been forced, but beyond this every effort should be made to ensurethat the Government do not widen their liabilities beyond the minimum necessary to achieve their purpose.11.     A point of particular difficulty will be to decide whether, if theGovernment offer to provide direct assistance, they should monitorclosely the firm*s activity or should undertake a minimum of inter -ference.    This will have to be decided in particular cases, afterlegal advice, but the aim should be to ensure that the Governmenthave that amount of information which they need to reveal to them thecompany&apos;s financial progress ao that they may then have anopportunity to detach themselves, if they so decide, without adding to their legal liability J but to stop short of becoming so much a party to the companyJs acts that they cannot avoid a wider responsibility.12.      It may well be that if the Governments liability is to belimited some departure from the guidelines on the terms of financeset out above will be needed.    Thus a grant might be more appropriate than a loan, the service of which would be incompatible with the company&apos;s future solvency and which might imply continuingGovernment support j but either might in particular circumstances be more appropriate than an equity holding.    Better still would befor the Government to avoid direct assistance and for any necessaryhelp to be made available through an outside body each as the JRC orthe Shipbuilding Industry Board.    Whatever the form of assistance,a prime requirement must be to assess the impact on public expendi-ture of the total liability that is being created, not only the directcost of the assistance offered; and to ensure that it is no greater than can be met from within the Departments approved financialallocation.JDTreasury Chambers, SWl28th April 19705
