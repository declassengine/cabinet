MENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S government(70) 61 COPY NO      g 311 May 1970CABINETFUTURE LEGISLATIVE programme memorandum by the Lord President of the council. I was invited by the Cabinet at their meeting on 19 February(CC(70) 9th Conclusions, Minute l) to arrange for the Future legislation committee to consider Departments&apos; proposals for future legislation,2. The task of planning the programme is complicated by the uncertainty as to the date of the Election,    Since we do not know how long the next Session will be, we must, I think, at this stage plan onthe assumption that the Session will be of normal length, and this view was endorsed by the Future Legislation Committee.    But in talcing this as our basis we must bear in mind that there are some Bills which it willbe important to pass into lav/ should the Session turn out to be a short one.3. There are other ways too, as was pointed out in Future legislation committee, in which the present special situation affects our planning.Some Bills in this Session&apos;s programme may not reach the Statute Bookbefore the Summer Recess and we would wish to reintroduce them;  I have included in the draft programme a number of those most at risk, but theremay be others, particularly if the Session is foreshortened.    Moreoverthere may well be new policies in the manifesto which we will want to implement by legislation for which no place has been kept.4, For ail these reasons any conclusions to which we come now are bound to be more than usually provisional and we shall need to keep thesituation under review,    But what is quite clear is that if we are to preserve the maximum freedom of manoeuvre we must be even morecareful than usual not to overload the programme and must rnake a specialeffort to ensure that Bills are ready when wanted.    A disturbing feature ofthe suggestions made by Ministers is that too often it is likely to be somemonths before instructions are ready, and even in some cases before apolicy submission is made; I have taken this into account in making myselection.
5. The list of Bills which I propose for next Session^ programme isgiven in Annex A.    The Bills are classified as usual under the following headings -Al - Essential Bills (i. e. Bills which must be obtained by a givendate)A2 - Contingent Bills (i, e. Bills which may become Essential inthe above sense)B - Main Programme BillsC - Bills in PreserveB(S) - Bills in the programme for the Scottish Grand CommitteeS - Bills suitable for Second Reading Committee procedureP - Bills suitable for Private Members6. The remaining Bills which were put forward for next Session&apos;programme, but are unlikely to find a place, are listed in Annex 3.They are fewer than usual, because fewer proposals were made by ministers; and the scope for variation is correspondingly limited.DETAILS OF THE programme is    Al - Essential BillsThere is one major measure here - Armed Forces - which mustbe passed before the Army and Air Force Acts expire at the endof 1971.ii. A2 - Contingent BillsThe largest group here is in the field of foreign and commonwealth affairs.    I am advised that major legislation on european communities is not likely to be required,    If it were, it mightcompel reconsideration of the whole programme, since it would presumably have to be taken on the Floor of the House,iii. B - Main Programme bills for convenience I have divided the list into three parts.    The firstconsists of Zdlls in this Session&apos;s programme which we wouldprobably wish to reintroduce as part of the main programmeif not passed this Session.    I have limited it to the Bills which seem to be most at risk of not passing by the Summer Recess,but there arc others, such as International Monetary Fund, whichmight need to be added.    The second part of the list consists ofother Bills on which policy has been broadly agreed, though a gooddeal of work may remain to be done.    The third part of the listcontains Bills on which policy has not been settled? in some cases,such as Family Allowances^ the desirability of legislation is in dispute.    I have included Cigarette Advertising here since thepolicy on this may need to be reconsidered.
iv, C - Bills in ReservePolicy on National Libraries and British Research and development corporation is not likely to be settled until late in the year,v, 3(3) - Bills suitable for Scottish Grand committee as these take only limited time on the i7loor and do not substantiallycompete for drafting resources with other Bills, I have included thefull list put forward by the Secretary of State.vi, S - Second Reading Committee BillsThe proposed Bill on Pesticides is too long to have much chance of passing without a higher priority in drafting than is given to SecondReading Committee Bills.    The subject is attractive, but it wouldoverload the main programme to add this Bill unless some othersubstantial measure is to be omitted.7, I invite the Cabinet to approve the programme which I put forward and I hope that in so doing they will emphasise the need to settle outstandingpolicy and submit instructions at the earliest possible moment.    We cannot afford to waste our limited drafting capacity because there is no work towhich Counsel can turn.T F privy Council Office SV7111 May 1970
