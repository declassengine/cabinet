DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY fS GOVERNMENT3C(70) 49 COPY NO8th April 1970CABINETINDUSTRIAL RELATIONS bill memorandum by the Lord Privy seal the First Secretary of State in her memorandum of 7th April(C(70) 48) argues that the Industrial Relations Bill&apos;s requirements for employers to disclose information to recognised trade unions should apply-to the Crown,2. This is one of a number of recent cases where ministers responsible for preparing legislation affecting the relationships between employers and employees have proposed that its provisions should applytc the Crown.    This trend runs counter to most earlier practice.    Animportant principle is involved which, in my view, should be consideredbefore any decision is taken that the Crown should be bound by the disclosure provisions of this Bill and which is also relevant to other areas where there is pressure for legislation affecting the relationships between employers and employees to apply to the Crown.    It is essential toconsider each case on its merits.3. The Queen is not bound by Acts of Parliament unless she consentsto be so bound and it is a rule cf law that the Crown is not bound by an Actexcept by an express statement or necessary implication in the Act.    nor can the Crown be prosecuted.    There are good reasons why it is generallypreferable for the Crown not to be bound by Acts in the personnel field.As the First Secretary&apos;s memorandum recognises, Ministers areresponsible to Parliament for the administration of their Departments and because of the special position of the Government their discharge of that responsibility may on occasion be difficult, indeed impossible, to reconcilewith the detailed provisions of legislation on personnel matters (eg insecurity cases).    If the Crpwn is bound, such cases have to be covered byclauses in the Act adapting its application to the special circumstances ofthe Crown, which naturally attract Parliamentary and public criticism.,(if there are no such Crown application clauses, the only course open to a minister in a case where he could not reconcile his responsibilities as  minister with observance of the legislation would be the unacceptable one ofoverriding the Act. )    In general, therefore, it is preferable for Acts in the personnel field not to bind the Crown but for the Government to state their
intention to provide no less favourable conditions.    Exceptions have beenmade to this generally accepted principle where there have been compellingreasons why the Crown should be bound (eg the Race Relations Act 1968 andthe proposed legislation on equal pay); but in my view it is for those who wish to depart from the principle to make a special case on grounds ofoverriding policy or practical considerations.4.        I fully appreciate that where the Government is seeking to applyto other employers legislative requirements to which they are opposed, itis difficult for the Crown, as a major employer, to exempt itself from theprovisions of the legislation.    But Crown exemption, like the doctrine of ministerial responsibility, is not a device for the convenience of civilservants; it is intended for the protection of Ministers and the avoidance of the public confusion which can arise when an Act is made applicable tothe Crown but has to be adapted to the Crown&apos;s special position by a seriesof detailed clauses.5.        In the particular case of the disclosure requirements the first secretary, while arguing that these should apply to the Crown, concedesin paragraph 9 of her memorandum that it is not proposed to take away from Ministers the right to decide in the last resort whether or notinformation should be disclosed and that a refusal by a Minister to complywith a recommendation of the Industrial Court to disclose information would not attract any formal sanctions.    This illustrates clearly thepractical difficulties which binding the Crown will create for Ministers.6,        In a case where disclosure was disputed the responsible Minister&apos;department would first go through the procedure of an Industrial Courthearing at which its case would be fully set out.    If the Court neverthelessrecommended disclosure but the Minister decided he ought not to acceptthe recommendation, public confidence would be undermined in the Court,the disclosure requirements and the Department concerned alike would bebrought into question and the difficulty of explaining and defending toParliament, and to the general public, the reasons for the Minister&apos;decision, however well-founded, would be redoubled.    Criticism ofrefusals by Ministers to disclose information in particular cases - whichwould be all the keener when it was realised that there was no way of enforcing on a Minister compliance with the Industrial Court&apos;s recommenda-tion in auch a case - would be likely far to outweigh criticism of non-application of the Bill,s disclosure provisions to the Crown.7.        I therefore invite my colleagues to agree that the disclosurerequirements of the Industrial Relations Bill should not apply to the Crown.civil Service Department, SW17th April, 19702
