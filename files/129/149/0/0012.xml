(confidential)THIS DOCUMENT lb THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENTPRESERVATION OF OCCUPATIONAL PENSION RIGHTS:    RETROSPECTIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State  for Social services.   In Clause 109 of the National Superannuation and Social Insurance Billwe are taking power to require occupational pension schemes to offer deferredpensions to employees who leave before retirement age, provided that they havehad at least 5 years1 pensionable service and have reached the age of 30 on leaving.   Our proposals are, however, being criticised as largely ineffective,on the grounds that the legislation does not cover pensionable service beforethe operative date; as a result, it will be 40 years or more before all pension rights are protected.   Before Clause 109 is reached in Committee, which maywell be next week, we need to decide whether we can do anything to meet thesecriticisms.RETROSPECTION2.   The CBI have throughout been firmly opposed to covering service before theappointed day in our legislation and it was solely their opposition which ledme to exclude from the preservation requirement,pension earned by such pastservice.   I felt that in the absence of any such limitation we should bevulnerable to the criticism that we were, in effect, retrospectively altering the terms of existing pension contracts against the wishes of one of theparties.   The CBI have remained firmly opposed to any requirement being imposedC(70)52Copy No20 April   197 0CABINET1
on employers   to preserve  pension rights  earned  by pre-appointed day service,   though  they  are  encouraging  employers  voluntarily   tcprotect  such  rights   (just as we have announced  our   intention  of doing   in  the Civil  Service,   National Health Service,   and armed forces   schemes).3.      Our proposal     to  limit   the preservation  requirement   to post-appointed  day  service has however  attracted  little  support,apart   from  that   given by   the CBI.     The TUC have  protested  against it and,   in   the House,   a motion put  down by Sir Brandon RhysWilliams urging   the Chancellor  of   the Exchequer   to  giveretrospective  effect   to   the  preservation of   funded  pension  rightsby making   this  a  condition  of   tax approval,   has  attracted  over150 signatures   from Members   of  all  parties.     At   a  recent  meetingof   the Standing Committee on   the Bill Mr Paul  Dean,   for   theOpposition,   said  &quot;If  one  accepts,   as  both  sides   of   the Committeedo,   that pension  rights  are  deferred pay,   it   follows   that  we want  everyone   to have   the chance   to   transfer  or  preserve  his pension when  changing   jobs&quot;   (Col  849).     In stating   this  doctrine,Mr Dean drew no distinction between pension rights   in respect   ofservice before  and  after   the appointed day;     andSir Brandon Rhys Williams has now tabled an Amendment (No 259) to clause 109 which, although defective in form, is plainly intendedto make   the preservation  requirement   fully  retrospective.4.       It   is   thus   inevitable   that,   regardless  of  any  action   theGovernment  may  take,   the   issue  of   retrospection wi31  be  raised   inStanding Committee.     I   still   feel   sure  that  it was   right   to  treadcautiously   in  this matter of  retrospection,   but  now   that   thegeneral  consensus   is becoming  so clear  I  am convinced  that  weshould   take advantage  of   it   to  reverse our  earlier  decision.    Wehave had a  full  discussion of   the   issues   involved at   two meetingsof1Social Services Committee,   on  24 March and  20 April,   and  theCommittee endorsed my proposal   that  - subject   to cabinet approval  -   I   should move  an  amendment  extending   the protection  of clause  109   to pre-appointed day service.5.       I  am not   suggesting   that we can  count   on unqualifiedOpposition  support   for any Amendment   the Government might  move to  impose  the preservation requirement  in  relation  to pensionsearned  by  service  before   the  appointed day.     It   still  seems possible  that   the Opposition,  while approving  the general   aim ofretrospective preservation,  might yet express  reservations  abouta Government move  to impose  this  by  legislation,   on such groundsas   that   it was   (a)   liable  to  inhibit   the  further voluntary  growth of   transferabi1ity,   and   (b)   improper   in  the absence  of  prioragreement  from the CBI  and other  interests.    But,   in my view,the Opposition have now come  out   so clearly  in  support  of   the concept   of  pension rights  as  deferred  pay   (see  paragraph  3  above)that   it  would  be  difficult  for   them  to  take an  effective  stand,on a point   of   principle,   against  our  extending   the  statutoryprotection proposed  in  the Bill   to  the whole  of  an  employee1spensionable  service.    We  can,   of  course,   be sure   that  we  should2.(conpsdemtial)llllli II.......IIIMWIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIWIIIIIIJIIWIIM^^^
have the full support of our own backbenchers in withdrawingthe present  restriction  on  the operation of   the clause.LAW OFFICERS&apos;  OPINION6. We should not, in any pension rights of employeethe appointed day - the porights of those who leaveOfficers have advised thatin the strict sense, be re&quot;provided that the proposeobligation on employers onthe employment after the cit would not be truly retrbenefits which accrued toby reference   to a period oENFORCEMENTevent,  be  legislating  to protect   thes who had  left   their employment  beforeint  at   issue  is  merely how  far   the later   should be  covered   -  and   the  Lawlegislation  to   this  effect would not,trospective.     (Their advice  is   that,d  legislation were   to   impose anly  in  respect  of  employees who   leaveoming   into  operation of   the   legislation!ospective,   even   though   the  rights   toemployees would   in part  be calculatedf employment  before   that  date.&quot;)7.       The counting  of  pre-appointed  day  service will  not  give   riselto any  special  problems  of   enforcement.    For  all   schemes   (otherthan  certain  schemes   in   the public   sector)   the  regulations   to bemade under Clause  109 will   confer powers  on the Registrar  toconsider representations  from any  interested  party  as   to whethera  scheme&apos;s   rules  provide  for preservation   in   the manner prescribe!and   (where  necessary)   the Registrar will  be empowered   to  requirethe  amendment  of  a  scheme&apos;s  rules,   or   in   the   last   resort  himself to amend  them,   for   this  purpose.     It will   then be  for members  ofthe  scheme   to enforce   their rights  under  the  amended  scheme  rules)through  the scheme&apos;s   own machinery  and   if  necessary   through   theCour t s.cost.       I am advised by  the Government Actuary that   the  effect  of bringing  in pensions  earned by pre-appointed  day  service would bejto bring forward  the  full cost  of preservation  -  estimated at 20 million  to  25 million  a year  -   rather   than allow  it   to bui1dlup gradually  from an   initial   level   of  about  10 million a  year,it would   if  only post-appointed day  service were   to  count.    Toput   the cost  of  preservation,   with  or without   retrospection,   inperspective we  can reckon  that  employers&apos;   contributions   to pension  schemes  are now running at   something   like  a   thousandmillion pounds  a year.9.       Although  it   is  difficult   to  assess   the possible  financialeffects of  retrospection on particular schemes,   a non-contributorlscheme,   fairly hard-hit by  retrospection,  might  as  a result  expecextra costs  of  about  5 per   cent   in   the  first  year,   which would reduce continuously  from  the second year onwards.     While   this figure might be exceeded  in the exceptional case,   the additional cost   for   the majority  of   schemes  would be   less   - particularly  so for contributory  schemes,   since  it   is   to be anticipated   that   a3.confidential)
large majority of members  leaving  such  schemes would  continue(as now)   to withdraw  their own contributions  in preference  toclaiming  a preserved  pension.     (We  announced   in  the White Paper,Cmnd  3883,   in January   1969 our decision not   to  interfere  with   theright   of   scheme members   to  a refund of   contributions,   and   I   see no  reason   to go back  on  this.)No  evidence has been produced by  the CBI   in support  of   its  claim that  retrospection could  lead,   in   the  extreme case,   to  the windinup  of   schemes;     and   it   seems   likely   that   the  only   schemes  whichcould actually be damaged by retrospection would be a  small minority which are  financed,   if not unsoundly,   at   least   on verysmall margins  of   error.PROCEDURE10.     I need not   trouble my colleagues  with   the details   of   the  besway of  covering past  service,  but,   one way or another,   I would propose  that we ensure   that  schemes have  some years  to preparethemselves  against   the  consequent   increase   in  their contingent liability for existing members who  leave before retirement age.This could,   for example,  be done by retaining  the presentprovision  in  the Bill   that   there must  be  at   least   5 yearsqualifying service after  the appointed day,   but providing  that,for   those who have completed  such  service,   the whole  of   their pension rights  for past  service should be protected.11.     If my colleagues  agree with my proposal   to amend   the clauseso   that   it  can cover pre-appointed day  service,   one possibility  -subject   to  the views   of   the Chief  Whip   - would be   to adopt  a sympathetic  attitude   to Sir Brandon Rhys Williams&apos;   Amendment   in committee,  with a view  to putting down a Government Amendnn.;n t  atReport  stage.    All  things considered,   however,   it  seemsunnecessary,  and undesirable,   to allow our  opponents  to  take even this much credit  for  the achievement  of  retrospection;     and  Iwould  therefore propose  to my colleagues  to  table a GovernmentAmendment  at an early date which would withdraw the presentrestriction of   the clause  to benefits   in respect of  service afterthe appointed day,  and  thus extend  the protection of   thepreservation requirement  to  the whole of  an employee&apos;spensionable  service.CONCLUSION12.     I  therefore  seek  the agreement  of my colleagues  to securingthe Amendment of Clause  109 of  the National  Superannuation and social   Insurance Bill  so  that  the protection of  the occupational pension rights of  those who  leave  their  employment  beforeretirement  age can extend  to rights  in respect of  service beforethe appointed day.Department  of Health and RHSCSocial security london SE120 April  19704.confidential)
