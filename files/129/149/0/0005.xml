(Document is the property of her britannic majesty^ government)C(70) 45 COPY NO,    ^317th March. 1970cabinetISTRUCTURE of THE TEXTILE industry memorandum by the Paymaster GeneralBackgroundAs my colleagues are aware, I was invited, with the help of theMinister of State, Department of Employment and Productivity, to preside over a small Group whose task was to examine the situation in the textile industry following the proposal by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) to bidfor Viyella and thereafter to effect an amalgamation between that firm andCarrington and Dewhurst.    The Group included Sir Joseph JLockwood,Chairman of the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation (1958-59), andSir James Steel, Chairman of the Textile Council.2.      The Group has now completed its deliberations.    I attach the paper which I circulated to it, embodying my conclusions andthe reasons leading to them.    This paper followed discussions withthe Group and has now been endorsed by it.    The Minister, who hasbeen kept informed, agrees with the Report and my recommendations.Proposals for Action3.      I am convinced that the Government now needs to take certainresolute decisions about this industry.    The standstill upon majoramalgamations announced by the then President of the Board of Tradelast summer was undoubtedly the right decision at that time and what i am proposing is essentially an evolution of it to take account of subsequent events.    As my attached paper makes clear, there is widespread uneasiness within the textile industry about the effects of integration between fibre production and textile manufacture.This has led to pressure to split Courtaulds up.    As I explained,this would in my view be quite wrong as well as impracticable:Courtaulds are a major force in the industry and in the economy as a whole and to break them up would have a highly disruptive effect.Moreover, up to the time of the standstill, we put no obstacle in the pathof their expansion.    On the other hand, I think it is in the interests ofbuilding up a strong and internationally competitive textile industry totake steps to prevent fibre producers from further integration by complete
acquisition, though they should be free to grow organically.    What I am therefore proposing is that ICPs strength should be harnessed to the textile industry in a way that does not embody the disadvantages ofvertical integration.4.      My proposed solution is the following:(i) ICI should be permitted to bid for Viyella and thereafter to effect an amalgamation with Carrington and Dewhurst, subject tocertain conditions.    These are that they should reduce their shareholdingin the combined company to no more than 35 per cent within a strictly limited period, and would in any event not use their voting in excess ofthis after 12 months; that they should establish a Board with an independent chairman of outstanding repute, an independent Finance Director andcertain non-executive directors, with only one ICI director; and thatthey should guarantee the freedom of the combined company to buy itsfibres and other materials from the source of its choice,(ii) No other fibre producer would be permitted to buy textile outletsexcept on comparable terms and subject to the normal operation of the monopolies and mergers legislation,(iii) Because of the substantial share of the textile market they alreadyenjoy (up to 50 per cent in certain key sectors) Courtaulds should not be permitted any further forward expansion in the textile industry byacquisition for the time being although they should be allowed to groworganically both in fibres and textiles, as they are in fact doing,(iv) A code of conduct should be drawn up (if possible an co-operationwith the fibre producers) to regulate their relations with textile customers,5.      ICI are prepared to give the Government all the necessaryundertakings and I am confident of their good faith.    I believe thatthe conditions are in fact so onerous that no other fibre producer will wish to expand in this v/ay.    But if they do, they will have to satisfy the Government that they accept the same conditions.6,      I am satisfied that, while the other foreign fibre producers maynot particularly like this solution, they are not likely to let it affect their operations in the United Kingdom,    The textile industry should welcome the restraint on further integration by fibre producers, coupled as it is with the prospect of a code of conduct designed to ensure fair competition,Viyella and Carrington and Dewhurst should derive strength from the closer association with ICI which nonetheless leaves them with their commercial freedom.
Support for the Lancashire industry7,      I have reached the conclusion during my enquiry that the Lancashiresection of the industry must have some help if it is to undertake themassive amount of re-equipment needed before the tariff on Commonwealthimports comes into force on 1st January, 1972,    There are various meansof acnieving this;  and various channels, e. g. through a Textile industry board set up under the Industrial Expansion Act, or through the 1958-59, or some amalgamation of the two.    Discussions are proceeding with theTreasury.    I shall want to say what assistance if any should be givento the industry when I make an announcement about the Report of myGroup.conclusions.      The objective has been to produce a package which will be, andmanifestly be seen to be, of advantage to the textile industry as a whole(i) I am hoping that the code of conduct governing the sales of fibreswill have a powerful reassuring effect because any malpractice will, infuture, result in complaint to the Government.    If thought to be justifiedv/e will seek a remedy by discussion with the offending fibre producerwith the Commission for Industry and Manpower (CIM) as our reservepower to whom we can refer the specific practice complained of.    Thereassuring effect on the one hand and the deterrent effect on the othershould arise from the specific and prompt nature of the remedy offered.This will incidentally be a good advertisement of the need for the CIM inits role as protector of industry as well as the public.(ii)  The Governments willingness to give support to re-equipment willbe very welcome to the smaller firms - and their employees - and is aconfirmation that v/e see a real future for them in the industry and arenot likely, therefore, to be indifferent to their fate.(iii) We enable ICI to bring its strength in support of major units ofthe forward textile industry without the rigidities of total verticalisationand without denying outlets to other fibre producers.    There is no doubtthat the majority of the work people in the industry see the commitment of large firms to the forward parts of the textile industry as important and reassuring in terms of their job prospects.9.      Three months have elapsed since ICI announced their intentionto bid for Viyella.    During this period everybody with a legitimate interestboth inside and outside the industry has had an opportunity to express views.It is now necessary to resolve the uncertainty without further delay and, if my colleagues agree with my proposals, I would aim to make a statement inthe House on 23rd March when a number of Questions are tabled announcing the terms on which ICI can proceed with their plans.H.L.Ministry of Technology, S.W.1.17th March, 1970
ANNEX TOMoMThe Implications for the Textile Industry of theici proposal to merge Viyella with Carrington &amp; DewhurstReport &quot;by the Paymaster GeneralBackground ; The StandstillThe President of the Board of Trade announced on 30th June,1969, that the Government had decided to call a halt for a period to further mergers between the large groups in the industry.The main justification for the decision was that the large groupshad grown rapidly by merger and acquisition in recent years and that,as the Textile Council&apos;s Report on Productivity and Efficiency hadparticularly noted, the full measure of integration and resultantefficiency to be expected from this development had not yet been realised.   It was thought that the possibility of further take-overs and mergers was creating an a/tmosphere of uncertainty whichwould impede internal reorganisation at a time when what was needed was a period of consolidation without further majorupheavals.2.    On the other hand, the Government decided to take no view in principle on the desirability, or otherwise, of links betweenfibre production and textile manufacture.   This gave Courtauldsfreedom to go into polyester production.   The government recognised, however, that a special situation existed where afibre producer was a monopoly supplier:   the extension of the monopoly into any sector of textile manufacture or distribution would therefore need to be scrutinised with particular care.   TheGovernment foresaw that there would be a problem in future ifCourtaulds bought up too many outlets for its fibre, thus denyingthem to other fibre producers, or if ICI achieved the same thingwith excessive investments in textile companies.3t    The Standstill on mergers between the large groups did not   .apply to minor acquisitions designed to improve their structuralbalance, nor to exchanges of capacity between the large groupswhere this would improve their position in particular sectors, provided,however, that the acquisition or exchange did not create orintensify a monopoly nor essentially alter the overall characterof any of the firms concerned.It was made clear that, while no specific time limit hadbeen put on the Standstill, the Government did not propose to vary its policy in the short-term.   However, it was considered at the time that a further merger between two of the groupsmight be acceptable in the longer-term.   The Government wouldin that event have to be satisfied that the benefits to the/public- 1 -
public interest of the merger outweighed the disadvantages of reduced competition.The ICI proposals,    id announced on 23rd December last that, subject to theagreement of the Government on the issues of public policy involved, they intended to make a bid for the whole of the share capital of Viyella International Ltd. and to enter into discussions with Carrington &amp; Dewhurst concerning the terms of a merger of that company with Viyella, the intention being tocreate a large company in the textile industry capable of tradingsuccessfully in the U.K. and internationally.   The company wouldbe run as an independent entity and it would be ICI&apos;s intentioneventually to reduce its holding to less than 50 per cent;    this might take anything up to five years.6.    The acquisition of Viyella and Carrington &amp; Dewhurst by ICIwould be a breach of the Standstill because ICI is a monopolyfibre producer and because a merger between Viyella and Carrington&amp; Dewhurst would in itself be a breach of the Standstill.The Evidence7.    I have now discussed the issues with the firms directly concerned, with the other fibre producers operating in thiscountry, with other major textile manufacturers, with the   leadingtrade associations and trade unions in the industry, and with anumber of smaller firms who asked to be heard.   Their views onthe main issues which had to be considered are summarised in thetabular statement at Annex A.8.     It will be seen that the overwhelming majority of those whogave evidence were convinced of the need to separate fibreproduction from textile manufacture, even to the point of asking the Government to divest Courtaulds of their fibre production.They argued that:(a) textile manufacturers needed to buy fibres oncompeti tive terms to enable them to meetcompetition from other manufacturers at homeand overseas;(b) vertically integrated firms could drive themore efficient textile manufacturers out ofbusiness by denying them supplies or by takingthe profit at the fibre instead of at the textile stage.The great majority were therefore opposed to the ICI proposal foracquisition of Viyella and a subsequent merger with Carrington &amp;Dewhurst.9.    Equally, however, there was widespread recognition that the standstill had become ineffective and was working in the interestof Courtaulds who were able to grow organically from the positionthey had secured through massive forward integration.   although some of the complaints about Courtaulds are undoubtedly exaggerated,I have been impressed by the weight of the evidence that to some/ extent- 2 -
extent they have used their position as fibre producers in ways which in the long run might prove detrimental both to the textile industry and to the consumer,,The Monopolies Commissions Report10.   It must be borne in mind that the Government last summeraccepted the Monopolies Commission&apos;s conclusion that Courtaulds&apos;monopoly in the supply of cellulosic fibres operated against thepublic interest and that Courtaulds1 policy of extensive parti-cipation in the textile industry was intended to preserve thatmonopoly and might be expected to operate against the publicinterest.   The Commission recommended, in the case of textiles,that Courtaulds should not be allowed to make further acquisitionsin any sector of the textile end clothing industries if their share of the trade thereby exceeded a figure laid down by theBoard of Trade, which they suggested might be 25 per cent.However, Courtaulds made a substantial number of large acquisitionsin the textile industry in the period of eighteen months betweenthe publication of the Report and the implementation of theCommission&apos;s recommendations, which, in the case of acquisitions,is embodied in the terms of the Standstill.   In several casestheir share of the trade is now well above 25 per cent and inthese and other cases their share may be expected to increase asa result of organic growth.Possible Solutions11.   The range of possible solutions to the problem now facing theindustry and the Government seems to me to be the following:-(i)   To divest Courtaulds of their fibre interestsThis I rule out ab initio.   I do not believe thata case has been made out for it;   but quite apart from that, such action would have an extremely disruptive effect on the textile industry.The Monopolies Commission did not recommend this,and there is the consideration that the Governmenthave deliberately refrained from preventingCourtaulds reaching its present position, although they had the power to do so.   Divestment through a merger of Courtaulds&apos; fibre interests with those *of ICI is not a practical possibility in the absenceof a wish for this by either party.(ii)   To continue the StandstillThe Standstill was the right course in thecircumstances of the time when it was introduced.However, it has been eroded by Courtaulds&apos; rapidorganic growth and Is now benefiting Courtaulds tothe detriment of other firms in the industry.The continuation of the Standstill without modifi-cation therefore seems to me unacceptable.(iii)- 3 -
(iii)   A free-for-all this would mean allowing the complete and unconditional acquisition of Viyella by ICI andits merging with Carrington &amp; Dewhurst.   this move could well be followed by similar defensivemoves by the other fibre producers, with theresult that we ended up with a largely verticallyintegrated industry, with textile manufacturerstied to particular fibre producers.   This would,I am convinced, weaken the competitive natureof the textile industry which would be deniedflexibility of fibre selection.(iv)   An intermediate solution in view of the disadvantages of the possiblesolutions mentioned above, I have sought an intermediate course, the aim of which is to combine avoidance of the disadvantage of completevertical integration with the strenthening ofViyella and Carrington &amp; Dewhurst, in terms offinance and strategic management, which seemsundoubtedly to be required.   The arrangementI have in mind is as follows(a) Viyella and Carrington &amp; Dewhurst would beallowed to merge under a holding companyformed by ICI.(b) ICI would be required to reduce theirshareholding in the holding company tono more than 35 per cent within a strictly limited period.(c) The Chairman and the Finance Director of the holding company would not come from ICI orfrom the two subsidiary companies.   TheChairman would be a figure of known reputeand independence.   There would also be some independent non-executive directors.(d) ICI would be represented on the Board ofthe holding company by one Director.   Theywould undertake specifically not to use theirshareholding to influence the subsidiary companies in their choice of fibres or other materials.(e) Any further integration into textile manu-facture by fibre producers would be prohibitedexcept on the sort of terms agreed for ICI.On the other hand, there would be no interferencewith Courtaulds1 organic growth, apart from thenormal operation of the monopolies legislation,nor with its development of polyester fibre./t)- k -CONFIDENTIAL
(f) All fibre producers would be invited to subscribe to a Code of Conduct designed to stop various trading practices which gave rise to apprehension of possible unfairness.The commission for Industry and Manpower mightoversee the operation of such a Code.(g) Certain further steps might he taken toencourage the requisite re-equipment in theLancashire industry.12,   I believe that a scheme on the above lines, would resultin a substantial strengthening of the textile industry. Viyellaand Carrington &amp; Dewhurst, as a result of ICI&apos;s majority share-holding in the holding company0 would he freed from the fear oftakeover by anybody else.   They would be able to get on withthe business   of improving their efficiency and profitabilityand would be free to develop relations with the fibre suppliers oftheir choice.   They would know that they had the backing of ICIfor their future development and could therefore plan ahead with confidence.   As I do not believe any other fibre producer wouldbe prepared to move forward significantly into the textile industry on a similar basis, uncertainty would be removed fromthe industry as a whole as to its future.   I believe that theother fibre manufacturers would regard an arrangement of this sort as acceptable.   If agreement can be secured on some code of Conduct between fibre producers, much of the present suspicionand distrust will have been removed.   The enforcement of such a code would undoubtedly be difficult and we cannot expect perfection.But it might be possible to look forward to a new relationship between fibre producers and textile manufacturers.Monopoly Considerations13,   I have considered the monopoly aspects of the solution Ipropose.   The arguments in favour of a complete merger betweenViyella and Carrington &amp; Dewhurst may not be overwhelming, butthere is scope for some rationalisation of activities.   no positive detriments to the public interest are evident.   Annex Bgives the information we have on the market share of each of thefive large groups in each of the main sectors.   While it will beseen that the proposed merger would increase Viyella s share ofdyeing from 31 to 39 per cent and Carrington &amp; Dewhurst&apos;s shareof filament weaving from 29 to 33 per cent, this must be comparedwith Courtaulds* existing share of spinning of 37 per cent, filamentweaving of 29 per cent, and warp knitting of 51 per cent. The fila-ment weaving and warp knitting trades in particular are under heavy pressure from Courtaulds at the moment.ConclusionIk.   The textile industry has for a long time now been bedevilledby upheaval and uncertainty.   It needs strengthening and reassuringJ8o that its inherent skills may be used to the best advantage ofthe country as a whole.   I believe that what I am proposing willharness the strength of the fibre producers, notably ICI., toimportant sectors of the textile industry without causing the difficulties which simple integration brings in its wake.&apos; /Courtaulds,. confidential
Courtaulds, which has played a major part in the re-structuringof the industry, will be free to develop organically though not byacquisition:   in view of the market share it has already achieved in vital areas this cannot be a ground for legitimate complaint.The other fibre producers will be able to develop contacts withcustomers secure in the knowledge that these will remain indepen-dent and free to exercise choice of fibre on commercial groundsalone *15. I believe that for these reasons a solution along these lineswill be generally welcomed within all sections of the industry andI commend it to the group.Ministry of Technology,Thames House South,8.W.I.10th March, 1970. confidential
