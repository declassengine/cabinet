I      introduction. This White Paper is about man&apos;s impact on his environment and specifically about the pollution of his environment.    the degree of control we can exert over that pollution is a major factor in the quality of our civilisation.   To exert a propercontrol, -three things are needed.    First , scientific and technological knowledge - knowledge of ecologyP which is the science of the way the animal and vegetable worlds interactwith each other and with the physical environment; and knowledgeof the technology to control        pollution at source.    Secondly,we need the right framework of economic analysis and economicpriorities.,   Thirdly, we need the right legal and administrativeframework to translate priorities and decisions into action.Kno-wledge2. Profound changes in ecological systems have occurred in the hundreds of millions of years which make up geologicaltime.    But the changes were slow, and even after man&apos;semergence about a million years ago, change continued to bevery slow.    Human beings -were few in number and scattered,and they did not do much to their surroundings.   With theexplosive population growth and industrialisation of the lasthundred years, all this has changed.   Vastly increasing numbersof people, on a vastly increasing scale, now dig the earth totake and make what they &quot;want;    they cut down forests, breedanimals, grow crops, and fish the seas; and from everything that is made or eaten, pollution is generated.3. we need research both into our environment as such andthe different parts of it, and into methods of pollution controlif we are to appreciate the full nature of the problem and makesensible plans to deal with it.    Some of this research must be directly on pollutants themselves: on where they come from,and how they are dispersed in the environment.    Some of itmust be on how they affect human health, influence the lives of plants and animals (especially those on which we depend for food), and harm amenity and our enjoyment of life.    Becauseecological systems are complicated and change continually in response to many factors other than pollution, we need a/background,
background of basic and often long-term ecological knowledgebefore we can accurately interpret all the actions of pollutants.h. Research into pollution is carried out in a large numberof Government, industrial and university laboratories.    Muchof the Government&apos;s work is supported through five Departments,the Ministry of Technology, the Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foodrthe Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland, andthe Department of Education and Science (which supports thework of the Research Councils and Universities).   The laboratoriesactively working on pollution problems include the WaterPollution Research Laboratory., the Warren Spring Laboratory(air pollution, oil pollution and solid waste disposal)? the fisheries and pest infestation laboratories of the Ministryof agriculture  Fisheries and Pood and the Department ofAgriculture and. Fisheries for Scotland, and       the laboratoriesof the Natural Environment Research Council and Medical research council, working respectively on the ecological and medicaleffects of pollutants.    The manner in which all this researchis administered and co-ordinated will be described in more detail in a future publication.Economics5. It is now widely realised that increase in materialgoods brings with it certain ndiseconomies5&apos; In terms of health,amenity and the attractiveness of the environment.    Sometimesthese diseconomies can be measured in monetary terms; and manycost-benefit studies attempt to do this.    But sometimes the damage is indirect and intangible;, and cannot be brought intorelationship with the measuring rod of money,,    Society must thenmake a value judgment on how much it is prepared to spend onpreserving and protecting the environment .   Having decided how-much to spend, it must then select the most economic methodof achieving the desired result; and it must take account ofthe way in which different methods allocate the burden to different groups in society - consumers of the products concerned,or producers, or the tax-payer in general.    There is r?ouniquely right answer to any of these questions.   Governmentand an informed public opinion must continuously search for/the2,
the &quot;best answer in each particular case.Legal and Administrative Framework6. In this country the legal and administrative system ofcontrol over environmental pollution is by no means new.   Cleanair legislation existed in the early fourteenth century; aman was hanged under it for burning sea coal in London, andthus making smoke.    It fell into disuse (perhaps because the penalty was felt to be excessive) but the modern system of cleanair law already dates from the first Alkali Act of I863.   Thefirst modern water pollution legislation was introduced as early as 18U8 and since then in both these fields   the system ofcontrol has been continuously developed.7. Until October 1969* responsibilities for the control ofenvironmental pollution in the United Kingdom were distributed among 10 different ministers.    In October 1969 the new post of secretary of State for Local Government and Regional Planningwas created with the responsibility,   among others, forco-ordinating government action on the control of environmentalpollution.   While his co-ordinating function relates to GreatBritain as a whole, direct Ministerial responsibility in Scotlandand Wales rests with the respective Secretaries of State.   TheSecretary of State for Local Government and Regional Planningis assisted in his role as co-ordinating minister by a centralscientific unit located in his own Office.8. In February 1970 a standing Royal Commission was set up with the following terms of reference:&quot;To advise on matters, both national and international, concerning the pollutionof the environment;    on the adequacy of research in this field; and the futurepossibilities of danger to the environment.&quot;Over the coming years the Royal Commission will be the mainsource of independent advice to the Government.9. One aspect of the legal framework should be mentionedhere j, as it is common to all the particular problems.   the penalties for breaching any of the numerous laws which govern the pollution of the environment are written into those laws;/they3.
they have therefore grown up over the years in a piecemealfashion as the laws were introduced or amended.   The Britishsystem of law in this, as in related fields, does nottraditionally rely on the very heavy penalty as the maindeterrent.    It relies rather on persuasion and the belief that,especially to industrial firms, it is the disgrace that countsand not the fine; the weapon of prosecution has in the past been sparingly used.10.       But the Government now believe that the present penaltiesare both incoherent and generally too low.    They stem from atleast 20 Acts of Parliament, of which the oldest dates back toI80h.   Typical summary penalties are  100 for emitting darksmoke from a factory chimney,  20 for installing a new furnacewithout notice to the local authority,  100 for knowinglymaking an illegal discharge to a river, and so on.   TheGovernment are now examining the scale of penalties, and willin due course amend the law where necessary to bring them into line with the realities of modern life.The Content of this White Paper11.       This White Paper is a progress report, setting out in broad outline the nature of the problems, the current situation,and proposals for Government action.   The remaining chaptersconsider severally pollution of the air, of land, of freshwater, and of the sea.    Pollution of all these by radioactivematerials is dealt with in a separate .section, as are noiseand the international aspect of pollution control work.
II    POLLUTION OF THE AIR12.       The Ministers generally responsible for the Government&apos;sclean air policy are for England the Minister of Housing andLocal Government, andfor Scotland and Wales the respectiveSecretaries of State.      There are separate statutory Clean AirCouncils covering England and. Wales and Scotland, the former ofwhich is chaired by the Minister of Housing and Local Government.In this chapter the term Ministers refers to the three responsible ministers.13.       The control of pollution of the air by matter falls intofour main parts:(i)    pollution by domestic smoke;(ii)    industrial pollution under local authoritycontrol;(iii)    industrial pollution under central government control;(iv)    pollution by motor vehicle exhausts.Air pollution by domestic fires1k.       Domestic coal fires are stilll the worst source of smokein this country.     Coal smoke has been proved to aggravaterespiratory disease; and. when it comes out of the chimneys of ordinary houses it hangs about at low level and so people breathemore of it.15.       Under the Clean Air Acts       1956 and 1 968 the localauthorities have power to declare &quot;smoke control areas&quot;, withinwhich it is illegal to create smoke in heating a house (or anyother building).     Within these areas consumers must thereforeswitch to smokeless fuels - electricity, gas, oil, and manufac-tured or natural solid smokeless fuels.      The 1968 Act makes itillegal to sell unauthorised fuels in these areas and alsoempowers the Ministers to require local authorities to declaresuch areas.16,       In order to help people in smoke control areas to converttheir open grates to smokeless heating arrangements a localauthority grant of 10% is payable, of which the Exchequer boarsfour sevenths.     In 196k-65 public expenditure in Great britain on this ^^^^^^VQ^^^^^^S^^^^OQj^_-^-n- 1 969-70 J-t was 5,120.000.     One-quarter of the houses in the country are5* /covered
MFIDENTIALcovered by this control.     It is not necessary to envisage atime when all houses should be covered;    there are places where so little coal is burned that smoke is no problem.17.       Last winter there was a tight situation in the supplyof solid smokeless fuels.     The other producers could hot for a variety of reasons increase their production of manufacturedsolid smokeless fuel sufficiently to make good the fall inthe output of gas coke.      The Government have teken the following action to meet this situation.      Certain unprofitable older gasworks will be specially kept in production.     The National coal board will increase their supplies;    for example, 150,000 tonsof briquettes will be made from Welsh anthracite duff,      steps are being taken in the public sector, notably in schools, to convert coke-burning boilers to other forms of heating.     Asa result of these actions more coke will be available for the domestic sector.18-       When this temporary difficulty has been overcome theGovernment will intensify the drive for cleaner air, to whichthey are fully committed,,     Additional money will then be allocated for grants for smokeless areasf ana the ministers concerned will be ready, at the appropriate moment to use their powers gtogoompel laggard local authorities in badlypolluted aroas tojti ake smoke, control^j^rders.Industrial Air Pollution under Local Authority Control19&quot;        This covers all industry not included in paragraphs 22and 23     below.      The Public Health Acts and Clean Air Actsgive the local authorities power to proceed in the Courtsagainst the emission, of grit, dust, and dark smoke from industrial and trade premises;    and authorities also havecontrol over the height of chimneys when new furnaces arebuilt.      In practice;, many authorities prefer to use their power of prosecution as a long-stop to campaigns of persuasionbacked try their powers of entry and inspection.      The widespreadintroduction of mechanical stoking for solid-fuel-fired boilershas led to a large reduction of dark smoke, and by far thegreater part of industrial smoke now arises during the short periods jf start-up and shut-down./20o The
20,.       The Government will shortly introduce&apos; regulationsprescribing limits f or-thg^jamount of grit and dust which may&quot;be emittedf rom various types of furnace chimney.------------------- - -21.       Local authority control covers more than 30,000 industrial premises.      Crown buildings and hospitals are not bound by theClean Air Acts       19o6 and 1968,     New Crown buildings of courseobserve modern standards of smoke control.     But there is abacklog of old Crown buildings and hospitals with antiquatedhe at ing boilers.     Within the general programmes for rebuilding-and &quot;modernisation&apos; of such premises., the Government.....will centiroaeto improve .sJsandardsMii of^smoke.&apos; emission.Air Pollution under Central GovernjnenJ^jDontrol22.        The Alkali Inspectorate exorcises broadly analogousfunctions in respect of the &quot;scheduled processes&quot; which are carried out In some 2,200 registered industrial premises.     Themain industries concerned are electricity generation.; cement,ceramics, petroleum and petro-chemicals, other chemicals, and    ,.,iron and steel.     It is because the technology of these Industrieis generally of an advanced nature that control over them isreserved to the Alkali Inspectorate, who are able (as the 1,600local councils are not) to deploy the necessary highly skilledstaff.     During 1968, the Alkali Inspectorate enquired into theamounts being spent by scheduled industry on air pollutioncontrol.     The figures for England and Wales pre set out inTable 1, which is reprinted from the 1968 Report&apos; of the ChiefAlkali Inspectorso      In Scotland about  20 million of capitalexpenditure has been incurred by industry over the same period for the same purposes./Table 1*HMS0 9s 6d7,

This is a matter on which the Government are keepinga vigilant watch,     But it may be noted that total sulphurdioxide emission has steadily fallen since it reached a peak of6-g- million tons in 1963-65-      This downward trend is expectedto continue.      The Clean Air Council estimated last year thatemissions over the next 15 years would fall as follows1970     5&quot;9 million tons1975    5*5h    ;i &apos;j1985     5*16      &apos; &apos;          /Concentrations8.Table.J.s    COST OF AIR POLLUTION CONTROL FOR SCKEDULETjMcclSSES 1958-i968&quot;^(EmiANT)&quot; A?5) IfALESl
CONFIDENTIALConcentrations of sulphur dioxide at low level have fallen evenmore sharply;    over the past decade, the average concentration in towns has fallen ny gome 33 per cent.Air Pollution by Motor Vehicle^ Bxhausjts25.        The control of air pollution by motor vehicle exhaustsis an exceptionally complicated matter because of the number ofsubstances involved, and the danger that the imposition of a lev/permitted level of one such substance may entail an increased production of others.26.       For many years there have been regulations requiringvehicles to bo constructed so that they do not emit any&quot;avoidable smoke&quot;, and prohibiting the use of vehicles whichsmoke in a way which is likely to &quot;cause danger&quot; to other roadusers.     The Minister of Transport has worked out with the dieselengine manufacturing industry a British standard (BS/AU 1hl)which is now being met by most new vehicles and which permitsless smoke from heavy vehicles than any standard in operation in Europe .     The Minister of Transport will shortly lay regula-tions to make this standard obligatory for all diesel enginesinstalled in new^vehicles^ and he is now discussing with theindustry and ^the,British^S^anclards Institute a tightening ofthe standard which will,in jiuje-j^ouj?s^permitted intensity of smoke.27.       At present the annual check on the maintenance of heavygoods vehicles, which is primarily directed to safety and onwhich the operators&apos; licence depends, includes a visual check on their smoke emissions.     The Government are now developing a method of using instruments for this check instead of thenaked eye.     As sjooj^jajs^jbl^^ the regul^yjfons^ wlljlbe amended, so that instruments jejan.b e used, instead of thepresent visual check.28.        Among the substances emitted by cars are hydrocarbonsfrom unburnt and partly burnt fuel.      The evidence is that thesedo not harm health, but they certainly smell.     They can bereduced by fitting to the engine a simple &quot;breathing&quot; devicewhich will feed the crank case emissions back into the airintake to the cyliners.     This reducos hydrocarbon emissions by25 to 30 per cent.     About half the current output of cars arealready fitted with this device, and the Minister of transport will shortly JLay^ statutory regulations to require that- all newvehicles sold in this, country should be f ittedjwith it./29. The9.
CONFIDENTIAL29.        The unusual climate of Los Angeles is such that carexhaust creates smog.  . This has led the US Government to requirenew vehicles sold in the United. States to conform to strictstandards of emission of &quot;both hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide.To meet these standards, British export models to North Americaare fitted with special equipment;    and a typical after-burningsystem adds  30 to  h0 to the price of the car.     For the future,the United States Government has announced a series of   ,increasingly stringent standards to be met in 1973 and 1975.These will reduce the emission of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxideand oxides of nitrogen to below one fifth of their 1969 levels.Still higher standards may be made possible by completelyre-designed engines now being developed which will run onlead-free petrol.30.        In Europe, due to the difference in climatic conditions,air pollution from petrol-engined vehicles presents a differentand less acute problem, and the development of a completelypollution-freo ear might not bo the most sensible use of resources.     But the Economic Commission for Europe has prepared,a standard which member countries may adopt to control emissionsfrom petrol-engined vehicles.      This standard includes thecrank case control device referred, to in paragraph above,but no further reduction in hydrocarbons.      Its,other maineffect would be to require a reduction of carbon monoxide byabout 10 per cent;    this could be achieved in most Britishcars by improvements to the carburettor and other minor modifica-tions which might cost an average of  8 pur vehicle.     Thereis in fact n ) evidence that the carbon monoxide in our streetshas any adverse effects on health or environment.     TheGovernment will consider carefully all aspects of this question before deciding whether to introduce this standard.31.       To-day&apos;s petrol engines are designed to burn fuel contain-ing lead, and future engines would have to bo re-designed if leadwere to be eliminated.     Lead is a well-known poison, but theamount that is emitted from motor vehicle exhausts is, in thiscountry, trivial.     The air in the most congested street con-tains far less load for people to breathe than is safely per-mitted inside factories.     There is no evidence that cars add-significantly to the lead which occurs naturally in the soilor in the vegetable food we eat.     The Government will neverj^he-less continue to keep this matter under review.
32.       There are four possible linos of development towardsreduced vehicle pollution levels.     The first and most promisingis the improvement of the internal combustion engine along thelines discussed in the preceding paragraphs.     The other threeare described below.33.       The combustion efficiency of external combustion enginessuch as the steam engine and the Stirling engine (a type of hotair engine invented in the early nineteenth century) ispotentially better than that of the internal combustion engine,and so their exhausts would give rise to less pollution.     Forthis reason much research has been undertaken, notably in theUnited States, to try to develop an external combustion enginesuitable for motor vehicles.     But unless there is some unfore-seen breakthrough.,  it seems unlikely that such an engine cansoon become acceptable as an alternative to the internalcombustion engine.3h.       The gas turbine has advantages over the diesel from thepoint of view of pollution and noise, and is a possible alternative to it for heavy commercial vehicles.35.       The fourth possibility is a battery-powered electric car.This would create little noise, and pollution from the vehiclewould be transferred to the power station where it is more easily controlled.      The main constraint on the developmentof the electric car is the limitation in range imposed by theexisting types of battory.36.Yifith rising population and livingstnndgtr ds.-Jffic^jnfflbor gof^ars jnay^j^o^.j^rpc.jurisdiction^d^o.jmcro.aso gf or a.consi^e^rajDlo^ j?cri,od ahead,,.  - It i,s the.jGovornmojnt    ___aimprij^irjgssig/e^ly to, .reduce i and, whorq XCA9AJ?.^.A?. .o.l.irainato thqsjfb^s^nce^s^ln. yohj^cle exhausts which&quot;jgro Iiarmful.&apos;.&quot;to--theQjiy-i^o^on^*   ii This will take many ,y,oarga and, in the meantime,be vend the measures described above^. will, be.,uMejrgtaken.37,       There is currently some discussion of the possibilities,apparently conflicting,  that on the one hand the increase of ^carbon/dioxide11.

III    POLLUTION BY NOISE30&apos;    An Advisory Council on Noise ha^lTeen:-set up this year under the chairmanship of the Secretary of State for LocalGovernment and Regional Planning to advise the Government onall ^f forms^pjF jnojlse^.39.    Any noise con he the subject of a civil action fornuisance at common law, and local authorities also havestatutory powers to require the abatement of noise through theCourts,    In England and Wales, however,  (in contrast to scotland), an abatement notice granted by a Court to a localauthority could not be served on the party who was making the noise unless he was actually making it at the moment of servicthe law was thus difficult to administer.    But this loopholehas now been closed by the Publie Health (Recurring Nuisances)Act 1969.h-O.    The most pervasive and vexatious noises are clearly those from aircraft and traffic.    The right of action in the courts for noise nuisance caused by aircraft is severely restricted,and for this reason the Government have taken a wide range ofpowers to deal with it,Aircrofthi.    The Airports Authority Act 1956 included powers for the Board of Trade to give directions to the british airports Authority on noise abatement measures and for theBoard to require the Authority to introduce a sound-proffingscheme.L.2.    Requirements at Authority Airports under this Act include(i)    Maintenance of height on approach;(ii)    Minimum noise routes after take-off;(iii)   Prior approval before a new type of aircraft is allowed to operate at an airport;(iv)   Aircraft to reach 1,000 feet before built-built-up areas and then throttle back;(v)    Imposition of monitored noise limits after take-off, lower by night than by day;(vi)   Severe restrictions on night jet movements at heathrow./In 196613.
CONFIDENTIAL

43. In 1966 grants for sound-proofing houses near Heathrow were introduced, and in the same year the British Government convened the first International Conference on Aircraft Noise.

44. The Civil Aviation Act 1968 empowered the President of the Board of Trade to require the management of certain airports to provide facilities for consultation with representatives of the local community on all matters concerning the management of the airport including noise, which might affect them. He has now required 33 airports to do this.

45 . In March of this year the Government laid before Parliament an Air Navigation (Noise Certification) Order. This Order is the fruit of the 1966 International Conference mentioned above, and anticipates an international aircraft noise certification scheme in the formulation of which the United Kingdom continues to play a leading part. The scheme provides that with a few minor exceptions sub-sonic jet aircraft developed from new on will not be allowed to land or take off in the United Kingdom unless they have a certificate from the Government of the country or registration that they comply with certain defined noise standards. These standards permit a level for each class of aircraft by weight and size which is only about half that now produced by aircraft of that class. The Government are also examining the possibility of requiring the noisiest existing aircraft to be modified to make them quieter.

Supersonic Aircraft

46. Apprehension has been expressed about the nuisance and damage which might be caused by sonic booms when supersonic civil airliners, the first of which in the western world will be the Anglo-French Concorde, come into service. The Government have taken powers in the Civil Aviation Act 1968 to regulate or prohibit flights of aircraft over the United Kingdom at supersonic speeds. True, Britain is a small country, and supersonic speeds are not attained within about the first hundred miles after take-off, nor maintained for about the last hundred miles before landing. Nevertheless, it is the Government&apos; s view that commercial supersonic flights which could cause a boom to be heard on the ground should be banned / and they


and they intend to -publish draft proposals to this effect witha view to consultation ,wrbji^lj- those,concerned.k-1.       Thb M;iriistry^ of Technology ism currently- spending - about ]^.JLijLlijQfi d year on a wide i^angc; of^aircraft noise researchJQrojjcct^s.     The work is done at the Ministry&apos;s research establishments, by universities, and by manufacturers under contract;    these firms also have research programmes of theirown.     This work will assist the development of a nowgeneration of markedly quietor engines,  of which the rb 211-22 is the best known.     This is only one example of the many wide ranging research programmes into different aspectsof environmental pollution.Traffich-8.        Car, motor cycle, and lorry engines arc becoming more powerful and, other things being equal, morepower means more noise.      In 1968 the Government announced thatthey would for the first time lay down &quot;precise noise maxima towhich manufacturers must design their vehicles.      this announcement has already resulted in modifications to what the manufacturers then intended for certain sports cars and heavylorrios.     The now rogulations came into effect in April.__19.70,and^ the., trend towards increasing noise has thus already boonhalgtqd.h9.       Recent research has shewn that it should, be possible toproduce heavy lorries which make no more noise than the averagecar today, to produce cars of all typos that make no more noisethan the quietest of current models, and to make some improvc-mont in respect of motor cycle engines.     The Ministop ofTrap sport is npjr, discussing with, the motor manufacturing industry a. phased and. precise programme of noise reductions which can boprogressively implemented during, the 197PJL..^ ./The 197015.
CONFIDENTIAL

The 1970 permitted noise level for lorries is 89 dBA, * for motor cycles 86 dBA and for cars 84 dBA. Some further reductions are possible during the next few years using existing techniques. The Government&apos;s long term aim, in which they expect to obtain the willing co-operation of the industry, is to reduce the levels for lorries to 80 dBA and for cars to 75 dBA. In judging the effect of this, it should be noted that a reduction of 9 or 10 dBA means a reduction of one half in the noise which people subjectively experience.

50. These proposals for new vehicles go further than anything that has been proposed in any other European country.

51. The Government also intend to include a noise check in the present annual checks on heavy vehicle maintenance, and thereby to ensure that bad maintenance does not allow a vehicle which started quiet to be noisy as it ages.

Other Noise

52. Noise from industrial processes, both inside and outside the industrial building, can only be reduced by successive advances in design techniques, and in this matter the Factory Inspectorate of the Department of Employment and Productivity

* The standard unit for the measurement of sound is the decibel(dB). For traffic noise, it is however better to use a special scale, called the &apos;A&apos; weighting scale, which relates to the band of frequencies to which the human ear is most sensitive. The dBA is the basic unit on this scale. Decibels work on a logarithmic scale, and this means that a vehicle that is producing 80 dBA, is creating 10 times as much noise as one producing 70 dBA. An increase of 3 dBA corresponds roughly with a doubling of the noise energy. But because the human ear does not judge increases in noise with the same precision as a meter, it takes an increase of about 9 dBA to create a sound that seems twice as loud to the ear.


continuously advise industry on what is possible. The AdvisoryCouncil on Noise also have this matter under consideration.53.       Planning authorities should increasingly be aware of theneed to separate noisy industry from places where other peoplelive and work, and the Government will foster tho development ofgood Tgractic^ .
IV POLLUTION OF THE LAND5k-       Land may be polluted by solid wastes from homos, farmsand industry, by the application of chemicals to farmland andforest, by the settlement of particles from industrial and domestic chimneys., and by the descent of noxious gases [fromthe air as solutions in rain,55.       A Working Party on the Disposal of Solid Toxic Wastes and.another on the Disposal of Household Refuse will bo reportinglater this year.     From their reports the Government will beable to judge the adequacy of the present system of controlover local authority refuse tipping,  and over the disposal ofindustrial wastes in general,,      Many ox these wastes have a potential for recovery and economic re-use.

The consequences of theincreased use of artificial fertilisers, and the problems that can be created, by the groat bulk of manure produced by modernintensive farming methods, have also caused concern.     Thesematters are being considered by the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food&apos;s Agricultural Advisory Council in its   1 current urgent enquiry into the effects of modern farmingpractices on the structure and. fertility of the soil.      Theproblem of farm effluent disposal is particularly acute wherethe volume of manure produced exceeds the capacity of neigh-bo ur i ng 1and usefu11y to ahsorb it,57.       Many fertilizers include a high proportion of nitrogen, and.pome of this   nitrate is in due course washed off the land byrain into rivers and lakes where it could cause the overgrowthsof weed and algae known as  ?blooms&apos;.     This run-off is now being studied, and it appears that natural processes contribute asmuch as, or more than, artificial fertilizers to the nitratecontent of rivers and lakes.      Industry is conducting researchto find new and more efficient fertilizers that are retained in the ground and can be fully utilized by the growing crop,ig /Levels

To he useful, pesticides must obviously be poisonous,  andsome of them may harm forms of life other than those which theyare meant to control.      In the late 1950s,  the use of theinsecticides aldrin,  dieldrin and hepiochlor for dressingspring-sown seeds was withdrawn because they were shown tokill some seed-eating birds and. the predators and. scavengersthat fed on the victims.     More recently further restrictionson these substances and on DDT have been proposed, partly because DDT has been shown to have some biological effects which were not foreseen when it came into general use, andpartly because it is now possible to replace them for someuses by less persistent pesticides whose residues are less likely to spread widely in the environment,59&quot;      The Advisory Committee on. Pesticides and other ToxicChemicals, whose members include independent specialists and representatives of interested Departments,  have the duty of advising        Ministers on the safe use of existing pesticidesand the acceptability of new ones, and. the appropriate Ministerthen issues recommendations accordingly.

Britain still retains the scars of the first industrialrevolution in the form of mineral waste tips and industrialdereliction of all kinds.     Prom 1951  to 1959 no government grants were available for clearing this dereliction,      In theearly 1960s grants were available only on a modest scale.Since 1966 the Government have greatly improved the systemof derelict land clearance grants by which local authoritiesreceive Exchequer assistance to clear up these scars.     In thedevelopment areas the Exchequer grant is now 85 per cent; and since many local authorities in these areas have a low rateable value base and thus receive high rate support grant, Exchequerassistance often works out in practice as high as 95 per cent.In the intermediate arid derelict land clearance areas, theExchequer grant is now 75 per cent; and in the rest of thecountry it  is 50 pur cento      The value of schemes approved for these grants has built up steadily from a negligible amountfive years ago.     Approvals for local authority schemes inEngland are now running at about  3m a year, and the SecretaryQ -Statjo^for, Local ^QXQ^J^^nJL^M Ij^ipnal^Pl^announced that Government grants would be available to matchdouble this rate of spending &apos; by local&apos;&apos;;author it ie&apos;s within.&apos;threeyears..:       At the same time he set a ten yc^ar target for the clearance of derelict land in the areas.worst: affected, and announced wblya appointment of a central group for derelict landreolnmotion, with local authority participation, in theMinistrx..of ^63*        In Scotland, a similar ton year programme is envisaged,and a derelict land unit is already assisting local authorities/to achieve
to achieve this target.     Approvals for local authority scheme:are currently running at . 1m    a   year and this expenditure isexpected to increase substantially.61+.       Tho Welsh Office set up a special Derelict Land Unit atthe end  rf 19665 this has already had remarkable success in stimulating local authorities&apos; efforts in the  clearance of derelict land.     Approvals of schemes in Wales are running at well over  1m a year.      1 /790 acres have been approved for clearance at a gross cost of  3-pm attracting over  2,6min grant.65.      Where the dereliction consists of colliery shale tips,clearance can often bo helped and speeded by using the shalefor road-fill in the motorway programme or for other con-s t met ion purpose  sos.

The Government also intend to revise the /provisionsgoverning -tho rating of the - exploitation-of minerals, includingmineral wastes;  this will have the effect of broadly halvingthe rate liability.21.
V     POLLUTION OP FRESH WATER67.       The condition of many of our rivers has been improvingfor some years.    In the 19th century, it was not unknown for both Houses of Parliament to have to adjourn because of thesmell from the Thames; but now the Thames in central London isclean enough for fish to have returned after many years ofabsence.       In the 1870s it was a favourite occupation toignite the methane gas rising from the Bradford Canal in yorkshire, and to &quot;see blue flames arise some 6 feet in heightand envelope the barges in their course, as they ran likegunpowder a distance of 100 yards along the water&quot;.68.       A survey in 1958 showed that about three-quarters ofthe length of non-tidal    rivers in England and Wales, and morethan half the length of the canals, was unpolluted.   although no statistics were available for Scotland, the position therewas certainly as good, and probably better.69.       Scotland is able to rely almost exclusively on pureupland sources of water, but about one third of public water supplies for England comes from rivers which receive treatedsewage and industrial effluent.    It must be a first priority to protect the quality of these waters,    not only for reasons of water supply, but also because rivers provide pleasure and recreation- for example, to hundreds of thousands of anglers.70.     River quality may be improved in three ways : first,certain industrial pollutants can be removed or renderedharmless before they are discharged into the public sewersand thence to the sewage treatment works; secondly, wastes canbe purified at sewage treatment works before they are dischargedinto the river; and thirdly, the flow in rivers can be regulatedso that there is always ample oxygen-rich water to diluteincoming pollutants.71.       Probably about 70 percent of industrial liquid waste is atpresent discharged into   public sewers, and that percentage is increasing.72.       In the next thirty years, the total volume ofeffluent is likely to double.    So, even if we are to do no/more22.
CO NFIDENTIALmore- than maintain the present condition of our rivers, weshall need sewage works with capacity for dealing with twice thepresent volume of effluent and (since the volume of water in therivers, and therefore their capacity to absorb and diluteeffluent, will hardly change), the effluent will also have tobe treated to a substantially higher standard.    If the riversare to be made cleaner than they are today (for example, sothat they can be used as a source of water and not just ascarriers of liquid waste) even more refined and expensivetreatment will be needed.73.    In certain rivers it will be necessary to increase the summer flow either by the use of regulating reservoirs (whichdoes not always mean new reservoirs - some old storagereservoirs can be converted for this purpose) or by pumpingup underground water to maintain river flows in summer, allowing the storage to refill at the expense of high river flows in winter.7h.   There will have to be greater care in reducing organicresidues which may make their way into drinking water, whichare not removed, by present methods of sewage or water treatment,and which may have long term effects even though ingested in only small quantities.75.       Finally, the Government must continue to be on the alertfor substances whose use should be discouraged.    nThere hasbeen good experience with the phasing out of &quot;hard&quot; detergents,which are not broken down in ordinary sewage treatment, and their replacement by other types which are.    There may In the futurehave to be more &quot;phasings out&quot;  of this nature.76.       To advise them on all these matters, the Government setup in 1969 a Working Party under the chairmanship of Mrs. LenaJeger, M.P., to examine the public health, amenity and economic aspects of the various methods of sewage disposal.   The working party&apos;s report has now been received and will shortly bepublished.   The Goyernment will announce, decisions on its recommendations as soon as possible.77.    A survey of river conditions in England, and Wales, whichis much more detailed and thorough than the 1958 survey referred/to^5*
to at paragraph 68 above, will &quot;become available to theGovernment in part later this year and in full early next year.These results, together with the Jeger Report and the WaterResources .Board&apos;s surveys., will enable the Government and theR iv egr&apos; Auth^throughout the JJOuntrjr,78.     Also in 1969, the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentreconstituted the Central Advisory Water Committee to advisehim on the reorganisation of the water and sewage industry.Their report is expected later this year.    The industry williJL.JLn,y,o?ase bayiL .LS, JQ3..^QS2.V&amp;QMXspA JLtLJbhjL, same time as localgovernment. i Any new distribution of functions in the controlQ^.J^?Qsh water pollution will be part of this major restructuringof the industry.    In Scotland studies of the reorganisation ofriver-purification and water-supply are being made in connectionwith the proposals for the reorganisation of local government.The Scottish River Purification Advisory Committee has also,following a broad survey of river conditions, proposed a ten-year programme of capital expenditure to treat pollution.79*    With these reports in hand, the Government will be in aposit ion, to, u.rid.ert;.gco .a., jiajgigojaal Clean Rivers Programme.80.    Local authority expenditure on sewerage and sewage disposal has been increasing and will continue to increase.Since 1964/65 capital expenditure has risen by ho per cent in real terms.    In 1968 local authorities were advised, as aresult of the general economic difficulties then prevailing,to limit expenditure on sewage works to schemes needed for urgentreasons of health or for new industrial or housing development.This advice was subject to the proviso that no action shouldbe taken or omitted which would actually worsen the conditionof any river;  such action or omission would, in any case, be contrary to Statute Law.    In the inproving^^ejconpmijsJjrciirnstancesof tcpckry^gthe J3oy eprunent.ghaye now withdrawn that advice in ordert^ollqw the river authorities^^and local ^authori^ig^s, ojnee.jy ajihtojjuid.3rtake raeaggure^ ^ ourrivers.81.    Some of the schemes which are already being prepared andwill now come forward will be extremely expensive;  one canenvisage expenditure of the order of  30m. on a singlescheme.    This is and will remain a rapidly growing programme.2k. /Well
82.        Well over 90 per cent of all dwellings have access tomain drainage, and most of the rest will have in a few years.But during the recent period of economy in Government expenditure  number of small sewerage schemes, especially in countryareas, have been held up and people have had to continue to rely on earth or pail closets.    The Government are now allocatingan extra  7jn. in 1970/71 and;  5m. in 1971/72 to enable thisbacklog of small sewerage schemes in England to be undertaken.Jh2Ji^l^,s^ocal authorities jare being authori sed to proceed withall deferred schemes of this__sqrtj^sorne. 60 schemes costing 4.5m are involved.    In Scotland there^will be.,,avjgn^lajbl^j3y-erthe same two years a further.  Im. for :sewerage schemesgenerally.83.       But sewage and industrial discharges are not the onlythings which pollute our streams, rivers    and lakes.    There isalso the danger of accidents and carelessness, whether it beroad tankers falling off bridges, leaks in riverside storagetanks of petroleum or chemicals, accidents to river and canalvessels, or even the dumping of pollutant wastes on the gatheringgrounds of reservoirs.    The Government are not satisfied that thepresent law on these matters is sufficiently comprehensive,, andwill in due course introduce legislation further to reduce these .risks.84.       Nor is surface water the only source of our water supply:it is also pumped from underground water-bearing strata.    Heretoo the Government are not satisfied that the existing law toprevent the accidental or inadvertent contamination of thesestrata is sufficiently comprehensive and^hey vvill in due courseintroduce legislation to strengthen it.85.       These measures - structural reorganisation of the waterindustry, improved, techniques, higher standards, more money,and more comprehensive legislation - will make possible a significant improvement to the condition of our streams, rivers,lakes and reservoirs during the 1970s.25.
yX^-PQLLUTipj^OF THE SEA. AND...THE BEACHESOil86.       Of all pollutants of the sea, oil has received the greatestpublicity in recent years due to the wreck of the Torrey Canyon,the almost ubiquitous presence of small quantities of oil on the beaches, and the lethal effects on sea-birds.    The Government have-two concerns:    first,to see that oil is not discharged by ships at sea;    secondly, to see that,  if a discharge does occur, the oilis disposed of either by dealing with it on the surface of the sea,or by cleaning up the beaches after it has come ashore.87.       Within the Inter-Governmental Maritime ConsultativeOrganization (IMCO),    a number of international conventions havebeen negotiated which are bringing under increasingly stringentcontrol the operation of tankers and other ships at sea and theliability of their owners to pay for the damage caused by oilspills.    In the achievement of all of these conventions, theBritish Government have played a leading role.    The 1954International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of theSea by Oil lays down conditions under which oil&apos; may be dischargedinto the sea;    in particular, limitations are placed on dischargeswithin the prohibited areas (which include the whole North sea and English Channel and much of the North Atlantic) .    In 1969?amendments to the 195h Convention were negotiated which make thewhole sea a prohibited area and limit discharges to a minimum amount which has been experimentally shown not to give rise to persistentoil slicks.    Most oily residues have to be kept on board ordischarged to shore installations;    and the Convention providesfor a system of records and inspection to assist enforcement.88.       The Government intend to ratify these amendments.,  Thgy^reenforcing,them foir, the UK in the Oil on Navigable Waters Bill whichhas already been presented to Parliament.____Thi^Bill^alsq....provichgsfor the present^maximum.fine of  1,000 on summary conviction forthe master of a ship which illegally discharges oil into the seataPJbe-increased to  5.000./Another26.
89.       Another IMCO Convention agreed in 1969, which has alreadybeen ratified by the UK, makes it easier for governments to intervene to protect their coasts when an accident like that to theTorrey Canyon takes place.    A third Convention tightens up theinsurance cover which oil tankers are obliged to have.   Tankerowners will now be strictly liable for a much greater proportionof the damage caused by an oil spill than was formerly the case;indeed,    that proportion is now the most that the insurancemarket as it is at present constituted will bear.    The Governmenthave recently announced their decision tp^rajj^They will shortly introduce legislation slat ion tc enable that ratificationtq..take^efj^ect^in^this.,cquntry.    It is to be hoped that the actionof so large a tanker-owning and oil-importing country as the UKwill bring nearer the day when the Convention has enoughratifications to bring it into worldwide effect.90.       IMCO is now examining the possibility of establishing a fund to meet any part of the costs of cleaning up after anaccidental discharge of oil which might not be covered under theliability imposed by the 1969 Convention, andM inithese,discussions..^S2*-Jih  British, Government intend to day a leading part. The oil industry are willing to &quot;bear their fair share of the cost of oilpollution damage and have set up a representative body which hasoffered assistance to IMCO in connection with the establishmentof the compensation fund,    The tanker owners themselves havealready set up a special voluntary compensation scheme which provides? in certain circumstances, compensation for damage up to k. 2m per incident.qq i      In 1969, an agreement on regional co-operation to dealwith major oil pollution in the North Sea was signed by thiscountry and the other States bordering the North Sea. It dividesthe North Sea into areas, in each of which the relevant signatoryState is responsible for reporting and tracking oil slicks.92.      Much work is in progress to reduce the risks that accidentsat sea may cause pollution.     It embraces routeing in crowdedwaters, the training of crews,, the use of modern navigationalequipment, the manoeuvrability of tankers, and the design of/tankers27.
tankers to limit the outflow of oil if there is an accident.93.      When oil is released it is sometimes best to sink ordisperse it at sea, if this can he done without harming fisheries.Research on the best methods of treating floating oil is stillgoing on.    The responsibility for deciding what action to takefalls on the Board of Trade, which has established an organizationfor this purpose   based on the Marine Survey Offices at Ports.94.      If oil. comes ashore on to the beaches that people use,the beaches must he cleaned.    The Government have provided foran interlocking system of local authority plans and provisions for beach-cleaning.    The Exchequer bears 50 per cent of the costof this,  the rest falling on the rates.    In the case of majoraccidents, the Government will consider meeting more than50 per cent  of the cost.    Experience since the Torrey Canyondisaster has shown that this new system is working well.    Localauthorities are provided with advice on the best methods andbest substances to be used to remove oil of a given type from various kinds of beach, and with maps showing where there areareas of scientific or fishery interest which require special treatment.95.      The Government control the conditions under which oil issearched for around the coasts of Great Britain.    If oil incommercially exploitable quantity is found there, the Governmentwill (through the Minister of Technology&apos;s petroleum inspectors)control and supervise the conditions under which it is producedand distributed.   An important object of this control and supervision will he to guard against the possibility of oil leaksof the kind which have unfortunately occurred in other parts ofthe world.     The Government will,,continue. Jn -consultation withand^production,so^as to prevent acciden^s^qf JshiB, kind arising.Pollution, of gthe,^Sea by pollutants other than oil96.        Sewage and industrial wastes are discharged into the sea,just as they are discharged into rivers.    The open sea has ofcourse a vastly greater capacity to dilute and purify them thana river does, but it is not infinite and cannot receive limitless/ quantities28.
quantities of wastes.    Inshore waters and estuaries - many ofwhich support important fisheries - afford much less dilution than is often thought. The water sometimes circulates so thatuntreated or partly treated sewage washes hack on beaches, andindustrial pollutants remain concentrated near the point of discharge.97.       Certain seas and parts of seas, notably in the Baltic,Oslo Fiord and a small area of the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of New Jersey, have become so polluted from a variety of sourcesthat their ecology has been changed considerably.   None of these as around Britain is near that condition.    Nevertheless,  theyare shallow, partly enclosed, and contain some of our mostimportant fisheries;    and a careful watch must and will be kepton them.98.       Eleven sea fisheries committees make byelaws (confirmed by the Minister of Agriculture)  about the pollution of territorial waters around the shores of England and Wales.    There are no sea fisheries committees in Scotland, but river purification author-ities are extending their control over estuaries and certaincoastal waters where major polluting discharges generally occur.The Government exert a limited, control over the way in which localauthorities discharge sewage to the sea, in that Ministers mustsanction loans to be raised by those authorities constructing newsewage works:    they can therefore refuse their sanction if the design of the works and the siting of the outfall do not satisfythem.    This matter has been considered by the Jeger Committee onSewage Disposal, and the Government will, if necessary, introducenew provisiqns^b,age,d on,,the,t.reconmendations.......of that.......committee proposed.99.       To guard against possible harm to fisheries,  the Ministerof Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood and the Secretary of State forScotland operate voluntary schemes to control the disposal oftoxic industrial wastes outside territorial waters.,100.     Pollution of the sea by ships with, substances other thanoil is being examined by IMCO.    IMCO is also working on precautionsin the carriage of dangerous substances and the design of bulkchemical carriers to limit the damage to the environment in theevent of a casualty,29.
VII POLLUTION EY RADIOACTIVITY101,      It is convenient to consider radioactivity separatelybecause the appearance of man-made radioactive substances innature and. in the economy arrived ouddently at a late stage inthe process of industrialisation, and the system of control was swiftly constructed by a state already well versed in themechanisms of control,.102,      Throughout his evolution man has been exposed to lowlevels of ionising radiation from natural sources,    When nuclear weapons were first used, and for a decade and. a half thereafterwhile successive generations of them were being tested in the atmosphere without inhibition, he was exposed to fairly sharplyincreasing levels.    During the later 1960s these levels have decreased as a result of the Partial Test Ban of 1963? whichin addition to its value as a measure of arms control is perhaps the greatest international public health measure yet to havebeen achieved,103*       It was during the period of nuclear weapons testing, Inthe 19h0s and. 1950s, that levels of radiation to which mancould safely bo exposed in different circumstances, from civiliansources, were being laid down by international agreement.    TheGovernment control the nuclear power stations and their attendantfuel treatment plants which are the main civil sources of radio-active waste.    Within this industry, the handling of radioactivematerials is under the control of the Minister of Technology,When the substances are finished with, their disposal has to beauthorised by the Minister of Housing and Local Government inEngland, by the Secretary of State in Wales, and in most casesby the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food also.    InScotland these functions are exercised by the Secretary of Statefor Scotland.    Many different techniques are used, includingindefinite storage in tanks under ground.    Slightly radioactiveliquid wastes may, under strict control, be piped into riversor the sea, and a certain amount of solid waste is dumpedin long life canisters in the ocean deeps.    This last iscarried out in accordance with internationally agreed procedures.Continuous monitoring and research have shown that no significant effort can be detected on man or his environment./ioh. -
lOU..     Only once in the last six years has the Ministry of housing and Local Government had to prosecute for an unauthoriseddisposal of radioactive waste which could have given rise toappreciable contamination.    The Ministry has also successfullyprosecuted several firms for failing to comply with regulations in a manner which might have, hut did not, give rise tocontaminat ion.105.     Because the problem of disposing of radioactive waste waswell understood from the moment it became necessary to take action, the control of radioactive pollution from this sourcehas perhaps been the most successful of all anti-pollutionmeasures, and is least in need of improvement during the nextfew decades.    The quantity of radioactive waste to be dealt within this country will increase substantially in the long termbecause of the increasing number of nuclear power stations and increases in the number of fuel elements sent here from overseasfor re-processing.    But the Government do not foress any difficultyeither in storing or disposing of this additional waste, and are confident that the existing legislative and institutional framework of contx^ol in the United Kingdom is adequate.    The position will,of course, be kept under review.31.
VIII INTERNATIONAL WORK106.      International work on the control of environmentalpollution falls into five broad categories:(i) The co-ordination of research and the sharing of itsresults.(ii) Metrologyt the discussion, standardisation and adoption ofthe terms in which various types of pollution may usefully be measured,(iii) The preparation of declarations commending good aims andgood attitudes to governments and peoples.(iv) The discussion and adoption of agreed standards and agreedprocedures for combatting pollution.    The standards and procedures may govern the management of physical resourcescommon to two or more countries (for instance,  an inter-national river, a sea, or the air over a continent or part of a continent), or they may govern Industrialpractices in the interests of fair competition.(v) The enforcement of such agreements.107,      At present the bulk of international work falls in thefirst three of these categories.    Although all.the categoriesare necessary., It will not be until the international community is able to proceed on a broad front to categories  (iv) and (v)that international work will make its full contribution to theproblem of combatting pollution,.    Until then progress will be mainly national, though there are also useful opportunities for effective hilaterial discussions.108.      Numerous International programmes of work on environmentalpollution are being carried, out in different organisations, andthere is some danger of over-lapping work and wasted effort.109. The policy of the British Government towards internationalwork.in this field can be .summarised as follows:(a)       To Jtofee parjb. in all the categories of. work&apos;- listed ;above in the   organ!sation most appropriate to j^ach^prqj^c10/(b)32.
To encourage a progressive rationalisation of this workso as to avoid duplication of the same work in differentorganisations.To establish common ground with other industrial countriesbh&apos;.ttie problems and methods^of.,eirjrtjronmehtaJ^^p^llgationcontrol which are common to these countries,,io^jassijBt^tda^jic^vj^lop^ijig^. countries to expand theireconomies and handle rtheir^nvironjn^t^ without repeatingthe mistakes which have been made by the developed countries over the last 150 years.To seek International standards for pollution control which will help to smooth the flow of international trade and to avoid interruptions of normal tradingpatterns through sudden and unexpected changes.33
IX   CONCLUSION110,      1970 is a year 01 intense activity for the many international-ional organisations concerned with the control of environmentalpollution.     Governments and specialised agencies are alreadypreparing for the United Nations Conference on the Environmentin Stockholm in 1972.     1970 is also European Conservation Year.As this White Paper shows, the United Kingdom is active Loth inthis international work and in attending to its own environmentaldefences.111.     The administrative machinery for controlling pollution hasbeen developing continuously in the United Kingdom over the past120 years,     The great epidemics of the 19th century - typhoidand cholera - which caused the first anti-pollution measures to hotaken, are things of the past.     Bronchial disease, which invirtually endemic and is aggravated by pollution,  is not.      the government are constantly alert to the possibility that other formsof ill-health may be caused by pollutants of the environment.112.     Although public health must be the most important criterionin determining the priorities for action, it is not tho only one.Increasingly we must pay attention to pollution which, while itdoes not harm public health, yet does harm amenity and the enjoyment of life.      It is not necessary that people should be made ill bypollution before the Government act;    Government must; alsoincreasingly act where people are o&quot;fended or annoyed by pollutj mand this new phase of Government activity is already well undor way.The priorities of the Government are;    first,  to take&apos; such action as will maintain and improve the health of the public where thinis demonstrably affected;    secondly,  to safeguard the health, ofthe public where it may or may not be affected    (because there are-many fields where certainty in this question is net possible )and thirdly, to act where pollution affects the ordinary pleasureand contentment of people in the quality of their life.113,      In the first Chapter of this White Paper three factors worelisted as being necessary for improved environmental pollutioncontrol:    better scientific and technological knowledge, economicprioriti.es and economic decisions, and the correct legal and/administrative34.
administrative framework.      There is   also a fourth, andthat is the will to do the job.      Government can and must give a lead.     But success will also depend on an increasingly informed and active public opinion.     The Government hope that this progress report on action so far, which will he followed later by more detailed publications on particular aspects of the problem, will contribute to the growing public debate on this crucial issue.35.
