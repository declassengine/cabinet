document is the property or her britannic majesty!s government cp(77) 89COPY no. 7 October 1977 81cabinetPUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1978-79 - 1981-82Memorandum by tho Chief Secretary, treasury. When we discussed the public expenditure survey in July(CM(77) 24th Conclusions, Minute 6), we deferred decisions for the timebeing.    I was asked to pursue bilateral consultations with the ministers concerned, which I have since done.2. We now need to come to collective conclusions, programme byprogramme.    So that work can go ahead in preparation for publishing theusual White Paper around the turn of the year, we need to take firm decisions now about 1978-79, provisional decisions about 1979-80 and a preliminary view of the two subsequent years.    Mere immediately, if thereis an early statement about measures of economic stimulus, it should include announcement of any public expenditure component.3. Our strategy over the last two years of containing public expenditureafter a period in which it had greatly outstripped the growth of national output has been a major factor in improving our economic situation.    Weshould hold to that general strategy.    We must not publish over-ambitiousplans which will have to be cut back again later, with the disruptions andwaste which that entails.    If as now proposed we decide on an increase in public expenditure over our previously announced plans, we must maintainconfidence both at home and abroad that we still have public expenditure under proper control.    The Lord Privy Seal has made the point, with whichI fully agree, that it must be made clear that the specific increases proposed in this paper in no way imply any general relaxation in the strict control of public expenditure, administrative costs and civil service manpowewhich has been painfully achieved over the last couple of years and isessential to our economic strategy.4. We need to take a decision about the total of public expenditure, andto fit the individual programmes within that total.    The Chancellor of theExchequer and I consider that we can now plan for some increase in 1978-79.But we must beware of over-committing ourselves.5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer and I have concluded that we can nowplan for an increase in the planned total of programmes and contingency reserve in 1978-79 of  1 billion in terms of next year&apos;s prices, or some 850 million in 1977 survey prices.   This is a large increase in the plannedexpenditure total, and to announce it will itself involve some risks.1
Nevertheless, I consider it reasonable to go this far next year, providedthat the plans we announce for the later years demonstrate that we aremaintaining our strategy.    The figure should however be the maiimum forcommitment at this stage.    To go beyond this would increase the risk, ifevents develop unfavourably, of our having to disappoint hopes for taxreductions in the next Budget.6. In recommending this increase, I have already taken account of thepossibility cf shortfall, on which I am circulating a separate paper(CP(77) 90).    Shortfall is allowed for in the calculations of the public sectcborrowing requirement, and we cannot score it twice over.    Any furtheraddition to public expenditure cannot therefore be justified by argumentsabout shortfall and would imply an equivalent reduction in the scope for action on taxes.7. The new public expenditure total proposed for 1978-79 will enable us to make some useful increases in programmes.    But it will not bepossible to accommodate all the proposals wnich have been put forward,desirable though these maybe individually.    The problem which we havenow to confront collectively is how to distribute the available increase between programmes.    The proposals put forward in this paper take accountof my bilateral discussions with the Ministers concerned.    The proposalsfor net changes in departmental programmes are summarised in the tableat Annex A and the notes at Annex C.    Annex B shows the levels offunctional programmes implied by the proposals.1978-798. Of the proposed increase over previous plans of  850 million at 1977survey prices, we have already effectively committed  520 million.    (this and all the remaining figures in this paper are expressed at 1977 survey prices. )   The major decisions taken and announced before the Recess on employment schemes, child benefit and school meals added some 460 million.    Even before this, the contingency reserve for next year hadbeen depleted by other decisions, and we shall need to publish a contingency reserve figure of the same order as in previous years, which implies notless than  750 million.    This raises the excess over the totals of the lastWhite Paper to  520 million (Annex A, Section 1).9. Still available, therefore, within che proposed total is a net amountof some  330 million.    The gross amount available to meet additional bidsis substantially more than this because of cost reductions and other savings which Departments have identified.    Hence we should be able, within theproposed total, to meet many of the additions to programmes which departments have suggested (see detailed proposals in Annexes A and C) andat the same time to allocate an extra  300 million for construction and alsoa provisional amount for energy conservation.    I propose that we should proceed on this basis.
10.       The Secretary of State for the Environment has proposed very substantial extra expenditure on construction in 1978-79, followed by afurther large amount in the following year.    There is clearly a good case for providing some extra help for the construction industry next year.    Atthe same time, we should avoid increasing public spending on constructionto levels at which it cannot sensibly be maintained.    Some berefit for construction should come from the expected pick-up in industrial and commercial demand next year, and output is expected to increase in 1979.The  300 million for which there is room within the proposed total for public expenditure next year should provide a useful addition.   I recommendagainst committing ourselves to further additions on this scale in subsequent years, though there will obviously be some on-going expenditure from the extra programmes undertaken next year.    The proposals in Section 2 of annex A include extra spending on construction of  56 million in 1978-79.I suggest that we ask officials to consider how a further amount might be divided between the various departmental programmes so as to bring thetotal addition to  300 million.ENERGY CONSERVATION11.       Possible measures for energy conservation are still being discussed between Departments in accordance with instructions given by Ministers.Without prejudice to the results of these discussions, I suggest that weearmark provisionally up to  20 million in 1978-79 and  40 million a year in subsequent years for the public expenditure element in an energy conserva-tion programme.    Here again, I suggest that we ask officials to work out atan appropriate time a suitable allocation between departmental programmes.Some of this would be construction, which would contribute to the additional 300 million for the construction industry proposed above.CONTINGENCY RESERVE12.       For the contingency reserve I propose that we agree now on a provisional figure of  750 million in 1978-79;  and for the later years thefigures of  1, 200 million,  1, 500 million, and  1, 800 million which wereentered in the survey report.    Allowing for differences in price levels,these are broadly commensurate with those provided in earlier surveys and white Papers - which experience has shown were not over-generous.    Anadequate contingency reserve of this order is clearly necessary.1979-80 AND SUBSEQUENT YEARS13.       The provisional planning assumption adopted earlier in the yearstarted from the figure in the last White Paper for 1978-79 and added anadditional 2 par cent a year after that.    I am now proposing a substantial increase in the planned expenditure total for 1978-79.    The justification forthis lies largely in current considerations of demand management.    Never-thelefls,   it should be possible to accept some increase in the planned totalsfor later years - which would be described as much more provisional -
provided that we do not over-commit ourselves and that we leave adequateroom for manoeuvre on taxation.    My proposal for the later years is thatwe should make the adjustments set out in Annex A and adopt these as areasonable basis for provisional planning.    They include (Section 3 of annex A) an allowance for some on-going expenditure on constructionconsequential on the increase proposed in 1978-79.PLANNING TOTALS14.       The following table shows in line 1 the totals of programmes pluscontingency reserve implied by my proposals.    However, the expectedrepayment of foreign currency debt by nationalised industries distorts the totals.    Lines 3-5 of the table remove the distortion by incorporating thetotal financing requirement of the nationalised industries, as in July&apos;sprovisional planning assumption.  million at 1977 survey prices andindex numbers, 1977-78 s 10077-78	78-79	79-80	80-81	81-82Programmes plus contingency				reserve as now proposed				1.  m                                            56388	58223	60206	60951	611792.

The row of figures in line 1 uses the new definition of public expendi-ture on programmes that we adopted in the last White Paper.    As the indexnumbers in line 2 illustrate, these figures show a rather rapid increase in expenditure in the first two years.    Provided our proposals are otherwisedefensible, however, it should be possible to explain the special problemabout nationalised industry borrowing and focus attention in the next white paper on an adjusted series, defined as in lines 4 and 7.    The path proposedin line 4 should be a defensible one.    As line 5 shows, it represents asubstantial increase over our earlier planning figures for 1979-80 and1980-81 as well as for 1978-79.4
16.        The 1981-82 figure shows only a small increase on 1980-81.     Thishas the advantage of leaving room for manoeuvre when we come to review the programmes in subsequent annual surveys.    The White Paper woulddescribe the figures for this year as being even more provisional than thefigures for the two preceding years.CONCLUSION17.       I invite my colleagues to approve the proposals in this paper as abasis for announcements about public expenditure in the proposed early statement and in the next public expenditure White Paper, a draft of whichwill be brought forward for consideration by Cabinet in the usual way.J treasury Chambers7 October 19775

ANNEX CPROPOSALS ON INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMMES(  million at 1977 survey prices throughout)This annex summarises the broad effects of the proposed net changesin programmes set out in section 2 of the table at annex A.   Allthese changes are measured relative to the survey report baseline.Proposed net changes in programmes2,     Ministry of Defence.   The figures shown would provide for thedefence programme to be held at the last White Paper level for1978-79.   In the two subsequent years, the Defence Budget would beallowed to rise in line with the NATO target of 3 per cent annualgrowth.   The 1981-82 Defence Budget figure would be published atthe same level as in 1980-81, but described as provisional.   I regardthese proposals as more tentative than my other proposals, since theydo not implement within the survey period our Manifesto commitment tobring our defence burden into line with that carried by our mainEuropean allies.3.   Foreign and Commonwealth Office.   The proposal envisages asking the Department to offset its bid for a UN force in the Middle Eastby savings on the diplomatic estate and elsewhere.   No allowance ismade at this stage for further savings in the light of the recentGPRS report.4. Ministry of Overseas Development. The current plans alreadyimply an average increase of 5 per cent a year in real terms from1978-79 in the aid programme.   No change is proposed.5.    e.c. contributions including agricultural support.   These figuresmust inevitably be tentative, depending as they do on decisions whichare not exclusively our responsibility and also on harvests and world food prices.   The changes shown will be reviewed before publicationof the White Paper.   Allowance is made of 30 in 1978-79 and 20 in1979-80 for a possible change in the e.c. unit of account,6.     Ministry of Agriculture. Fisheries and Food/Department ofAgriculture and Fisheries for Scotland.   The figures shown excludeagricultural support related to e.c. contributions (see preceding
?paragraph) but include Northern Ireland.   The proposals envisagethat we should approve the Minister&apos;a proposals for cancelling thedelay imposed last year on payment of capital grants (beginningthis year) and accept the savings which he has offered to make.7.     Department of Industry.   Tne proposals include a substantialallocation of extra funds for general industrial support (25 in1978-79 and approaching 60 in the three subsequent years).    also included is provision for the J^ord Erika project and for cancellingthe delay imposed last year in payment of regional development grants,to begin this year and be completed next.   The proposals assume thatthe Department will find a small amount of offsetting savings from within existing programmes.8.    Department of Trade.   The figures include provision (already agreed) for a new building for the International Maritime consultative organisation.   It is proposed that we should accept the costreductions in capital expenditure on civil aviation and plan forincreased receipts from marine survey fees.9.    Department of Employment.   As a partial offset to the Hollandmeasures shown in section 1 of annex A, the Manpower services commission have been asked to find savings elsewhere in their programme, and the net amounts set out in section 2 of the annex a table reflect this.10.   Department of Prices of Consumer Protection.   It is proposed thatwe should accept the Departments outstanding bids, including those forthe Price Commission and Consumer Advice Centres as well as certainsmaller items which are contingent on passage of the necessary legislation.11.   Department of Energy.   In the light of my bilateral discussionwith the Secretary of State, the figures in annex A cover coal stockingaid and the Hunterston guarantee in 1978-79 and Drax compensation in1980-81 and 1981-82.   We could be faced also with substantial extra expenditure on acoount of the nuclear programme, the Joint EuropeanTorus (if it is sited at Culham) and coke stocking aid, but no provision is made for these at present.   The figures shown againstthe Department of Energy contain no allowance for a new energyconservation programme, which is dealt with separately in the main pap01&quot;&apos;
12.   Denartme       &apos; Transport.    The proposals envisage that we should accept the Depg bids for extra expenditure on local transport and on bus grant, which reflect the policy in the Transport WhiteRaper, and fo   other minor items.   However, the Transport White Paperincreases should he offset by savings on motorways and trunk roads and the grant to British Rail, as proposed in the White Paper, asshould the fe items (and likewise any costs arising fromreconstruc i National Freight Corporation).   I recognisethat the pc i road construction iti 1978-79 is relatively tightbut hop&apos; can be mitigated by a Department of Transportshere in the proposed construction package.the Environment ; housing.   The proposals imply that the Deps should he asked to score as net savings the reductions estimates of subsidies etc resulting mainly fromlower assumptions - except to the extent that theseare offs * rent receipts and mortgage repayments thanassumed st White Paper.   I know that the Secretary of Statefeels that is a strong case for allocating more money for housing : ant next year, particularly to the housing associations.I hope room may be found for this within the proposedconstruction package.14.   De; : of the Environment : other environmental servicesand DevelopBant Commission.   The proposals envisage that we should accept the    sduced requirements for regional water authorities indentified in the public expenditure survey report, and that we should ask theDepartme;;       i absorb the small amount of extra expenditure proposedopment Commission.   Additional provision has however been allowed environmental services in the light of thedepartment      adgment of the minimum attainable level of currentaxpenditx; al authorities on those services after 1978-79.15.   Hos The proposals envisage that we should accept theSome Seci     ry&apos;s proposals for additional expenditure, which ariseMainly from   icreased costs in the law and order pto^r&amp;mme butprovide a] real increase of about 10 a year, subject to someoffsetting s .1:.:*; - - .: been identified in discussion betweenthe Home Office and the Treasury.(- r C1 n r TSECiVci
16.   Lord Chancellor&apos;b Department.   The figures imply acceptance ofthe proposals for extra expenditure on court building and judges&apos;salaries, on the basis that this will be offset in part by increases in court fees.17.   Department of Education and Science.   The proposed net additionsset out in section 2 of the annex A table reflect the Department&apos;judgment that it will not be possible to realise savings on the schools programme as fast as demographic factors ought in theoryto permit.   The proposed figures also include small additionalamounts for science (in all four years of the survey period) and forthe arts (in the last three years).   The figures in section 2 do not include anything extra for the school building programme next year -an itento which the Secretary of State attaches high priority.   i hope, however, that it may be possible to find something extra forthis within the proposed construction package.18.   DHSS ; Health and personal social services.   The proposalsenvisage that we should accept some extra provision, especiallyin the last two years of the survey period, mainly for demographicreasons but allowing also for some real improvement.   I hope thatthe programme will also benefit from a snare in next year&apos;sconstruction package.19.   DHSS : Social security.   The child benefit increase agreed inJuly is shown in section 1 of annex A.   The changes shown in section in estimated expenditure on benefits arise from revisions to theeconomic and other assumptions since the last White Paper.   TheSecretary of State has proposed substantial further increases in the mobility allowance, on top of the 40 per cent increase already announced for this November.   The proposals at annex A provide fora further increase, in line with prices, in November 1978 and annual increases to maintain its real value thereafter.20.   Other public services.   The figures shown apeinst this item in annex A exclude Home Office, Department of Transport and scottish and Welsh Office components of the &quot;other public services&quot; programme,which are included within the figures for these departments.   my proposals imply that Customs and   Excise and the Department for national Savings should contain their expenditure within the existingSECRET
White Paper levels but allow some small proposals for additional expenditure by other Departments not shown separately in the table.The substantial increase in 1981-82 is for the census.21.   Superannnwtinn and common services.   This includes anestimating change in superannuation, and bids by the Civil service department for administrative computers.   The proposal implies thatthe Property Servioes Agency should absorb their additional proposalswithin their programme, subject to any allocation they may receive from the construction package.22.   Scotland. Wales and Northern Ireland.   The proposals are based onthe principle of allowing for net changes broadly comparable to thosein English programmes, while recognising that each Secretary of state may wish to reallocate expenditure between the programmes for which heis responsible.23.   Urban programme.     It has already been agreed in GEN26 that the extra amounts shown should be provided for the expanded urban programme in 1979-80 and later years.   These amounts will be allocated to programmes before publication of the White Paper.24.   Employment Protection Act (Local authority spending still to be allocated).   Local authorities willincur some additional expenditure as a result of the Employment Protection Act.   The amounts involved are uncertain at present but should become clearer in the next fewweeks.   The provision to be made will be reviewed and allocated toprogrammes before publication of the White Paper.25.   Energy conservation.   The provision I have proposed for this is discussed in the main paper. t26.   Nationalised industries (BSC).   The British Steel Corporationsfinancing requirements next year are likely to exceed substantially   ,the provision made earlier in the year.   Provisionally, allowance ismade for an extra 60 next year.Contingency reserve27.   Paragraph 12 of the main paper makes proposals for the size of the contingency reserve.   The proposals for individual programmes
in annex A include no allowance for a number of potential claims,including participation in e.c. schemes of financial support, other employment subsidy, and various energy and nationalised industryitems..   All such claims, if approved, would fall to be chargedagainst the contingency reserve.28.   Presentation of the figures may be helped by substantial reductions in refinancing of fixed rate credits, for exports and shipbuilding.   The refinancing scheme is currently being renegotiatedwith the banks, and consideration is being given to the possibility that the savings banks might also take over some of this refinancing&apos;This may result in the removal of substantial sums from the public expenditure and PSBR figures; but such changes in the source offinance for fixed rate credits would have a neutral effect on themoney supply and economic activity.e.c. expenditure, extension or replacement of the temporary
