^ DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY-S GOVERNMENT81CP(77) 90 COPY no. 7 October 1977CABINETSHORTFALL IN PUBLIC EXPENDITURE PROGRAMMESMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury. At the Cabinet meeting on 7 July (CM(77) 24th Conclusions), I was asked to circulate a paper on shortfall, its causes and its likely futurepattern, especially in 1978-79-    The annexed analysis by officials examinesrecent experience of shortfall, and offers a view about its likely scale infuture years.2. There are three main points which emerge from the analysis ofshortfall: -i. Shortfall is not a new phenomenon:  it has been a recurringfeature of public expenditure programmes in recent years.    It hasoccurred frequently in construction programmes.    It has been particularly prevalent in the nationalised industries, and thereforean identified allowance for shortfall is included in that programme.Elsewhere, its incidence has been more variable.ii. Shortfall last year was the largest since 1972-73.    This maywell have reflected, in part, the adjustment by Departments to thenew control system of cash limits.    Other factors - in particular the slower than expected implementation of industrial andemployment programmes - were also important.iii. Leaving aside the effect of cash limits, there is no specialreason for expecting that the conditions leading to large shortfallsin the past will obtain next year.    The slippage in the industrial and employment programmes should not be continuing on a similarscale.    As regards cash limits, programme managers will have grown more accustomed to the system and this should enable themto develop ways of regulating their expenditure more closely, so thatthey spend up to the limits without exceeding them.    We should notassume that cash limits will always allow too little for inflation:   sofar as we can see, the allowances for inflation used in setting thisyear&apos;s cash limits will generally turn out to be adequate.1
3. The question is whether the likelihood of shortfall can be used tojustify a larger increase in public expenditure programmes above theCmnd 6721 levels.    There are two issues here.    The first is whether there are any reasons of substance for raising our expenditure plans onthis account.    The second is whether, as a presentational matter, wecould use the shortfall argument to justify raising the planned level of spending.SUBSTANCE4. As to the substance, the question is not whether shortfall will occur.A judgment about the likely extent of shortfall is incorporated in the forecasts of the economy and the Public Sector Borrowing Requirementwhich underlie proposals made on the levels of expenditure and taxation.Shortfall is therefore already taken into account in such proposals.5. On the question whether there has been some permanent increasein the tendency for shortfall to occur, all I can advise my colleagues is thatevidence based on 197 6-7? is not conclusive.    Apart from the unfamiliarityof departmental managers with the cash limits system, other factors alsoinfluenced the outturn last year.    It would be unwise at this stage to baseour plans on an assumption that shortfall will exceed the range ^ to 1 per cent of total planned expenditure ( 270- 550 million at 1977 Survey prices) whichthe attached analysis by officials concludes that we might expect in a normal year.PRESENTATION6. Last year we stopped publishing an aggregate deduction forshortfall in the public expenditure plans.    The reason for this change was that we are operating the plans as control totals and by its natureshortfall cannot be planned or controlled.    The deduction for shortfallreduced the overall control total and increased the risk of overspendingit with all the criticisms which that attracts.    These arguments are stillvalid and, having made this change last year, I am not in favour ofreinstating it now.7. In our last discussion I asked colleagues who thought heavy shortfalllikely next year to identify it and reduce their programme figuresaccordingly.    If specific estimating reductions of this kind could be found,it would ease our task in the expenditure Survey.    But in fact no individualMinister has felt able, in the bilateral discussions, to reduce his ownprogramme figures on this account.2
8. Even if we decided to restore the aggregate deduction for shortfall in the next White Paper, we should have to deduct shortfall also from thetotal in Cmnd 6721 with which the new plans would be compared.    to compare a new expenditure total which was reduced by an allowance forshortfall with a Cmnd 6721 total which made no allowance for shortfall wouldnot be a comparison of like with like;  and this would be immediately pointedout.    The problem of presentation could not therefore be solved simply byrestoring a deduction for shortfall in the next White Paper.J treasury Chambers7 October 19773
ANNEXRECENT EXPERIENCE OF SHORTFALLSd far in the 1970&apos;s the actual volume of public expenditure in thecurrent year has usually fallen short of the level planned in thepublic expenditure White Paper.2.   The following table ohov/s the general provision for shortfallshown in the White Paper published during the year in question anda subsequent estimate of the shortfall actually observed, both inabsolute amount and as a percentage of planned expenditure.     it shows that the observed scale of shortfall.has varied from nil toabout 7j\ per cent (in 1972-3).     Not surprisingly, this actualperformance was much more erratic than the rather formal forwardprovisions for shortfall made in the White Papers.PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SHORTFALL		&amp; million at	successive	Percentage of	-	Survey p	rices	plann c d pro gramme		forward	observed	observed		provision	performance	P_erforman.ce197?&apos;	-73	-200	- 903	1973&apos;	-74	-400	- 353	-1.119?A	-75	-300	t   13	-1975	-7&amp;	-200	- 392	-0.81976	-77(prov;)	n.a.	-1542	: -2,73*   In the table the government&apos;s capital financing of the national-isei industries and also their capital expenditure is excluded fromall years.     A section about the nationalised industries is below,/J.-.   For this purpose the shortfall has been taken to be the differencebetween the actual expenditure in any given year and the last plannedfigures for that year.     Thus for 1973-76, the estimate of outturnpublished in the White Paper of January 1977 (Cmnd. 6721) is comparedwith the plans for 1973-76 included in the White Paper of February 1973.(Grand 6393) revalued to the price basis of the 1977 White Paper.This procedure means that for each year an early estimate of shortfallis used.     It has proved difficult accurately to up-date the estimates
CONFIDENTIALto incorporate later outturn information on different price bases.It&apos; scows probable however that, especially for the earlier year;.),the estimates over-state slightly the true shortfall that occurred.For 1976-77 the figures are inevitably very provisional and may wellbe revised by the time thoy are published in the next White Paper.5.   In each year, half or more of the main programmes fell short ofthe total planned for the year.     This was true even in 1974-751when the total wa3 overspent.     The pattern has changed from yearto year.     Only the programmes for Defence,   for Roads andTransport, for ivorthern Ireland and for Common Services show a shortfall  in every year.       The three largest expenditureprogramme3, Education, Health and Personal Social Services, and social Security all show only small variations - in both directionsfrom planned expenditure.     Some other programmes show big variation in both directions from planned levels.     Tables 1 and 2 attachedshow the performance of each main programme in the five years /\C)&apos;?2.-to 1976-77.6.   It should be expected that variations between plan and outturnwould be erratics   forecasts must contain a margin of error, even when events are correctly foreseen, and the unexpected can happenbetween publication of the White Paper and the end of the financialyear.     Systematic tendencies consistently to under (or over) spendought be cleared away by altering the planning figures in the annuo-1-scrutiny of the Survey and Estimates.     Because the variationsoccur for many different reasons, full explanations of performance,whether by programme or by year, would be lengthy.     Tho followingnotes are therefore very selective.Shortfall, year by year7.   The year ISZizZl shows the biggest percentage shortfall, larger *that in 1976-77.   The then government had boosted its plans for the 5as a part of its reflationary policy.     Shortfall on capital invest&quot;ment (excluding the nationalised industries) was some  4-00 million 1a large figure by comparison with later years, and there was alsounderspending on other reflationary programmes.     In addition, the1&apos;0v/as an exceptional shortfall in the programme for Agriculture and food, reflecting higher world prices and a saving on agriculturalsubsidies beyond thogo anticipated in the relatively early white paper (it was published in December 1972).CONFIDENTIAL
confidential*    lD 1973-74 the reduced total shortfall was the not result ofsome substantial discrepancies on individual programmes.   . Theunusually large shortfall in the Defence programme was attributed to the delays and dislocations caused by the &quot;3-day week&quot; early in1974, after the White Paper had been published.     Overspending pnthe Housing programme occurred in both subsidy payments and in new construction:   the government&apos;s attitude tc housing was then generallypermissive. In Education the effect of rephasing building programmesseemel to have been underestimated, contributing to the unusual shortfall.9*   In 1,974-75; there was substantial overspending, compared withthe plans published in the White Paper of January 1975* in three off the social programmes:    Housing, Environmental Services and education.     Unusually, there was overspending on capital investment in total.     It seems that the V/hite Paper did not allow sufficientlyfor the momentum that hod developed in local authority expenditure.Even in this year of no net shortfall there were some importantshortfalls on individual programmes.     In the Agriculture programmeit was caused partly by the premature repayment, after the V/hitePaper was published, of a loan to sugar refiners, mads in the context of the sugar price explosion in that winter,10. By .1975-76 strenuous efforts were being made to check the growth of expenditure, including a tougher attitude to spending by local&apos;authorities.     Overspending on Housing continued but there was short-fall on all other programmes, though mostly small in scale.     Signifi-cant shortfall however persisted in the Northern Ireland programme and in the Trade, Industry and Employment field.     There was n larger than usual discrepancy on Social Security, reflecting the effect of extra inflation in the latter part of the year on the real value of benefits,11. The provisional outturn figures for I^ZisbZZ ^n ^he Survey Reportindicated a shortfall which, though large in absolute terms, is not as large in percentage terms as that in 1972-73*     Tobies 1 and ?,show that it was concentrated on relatively few programmes, othersshowing a fairly normal performance.     The impact of cash limits onperformance is not easily assessed. Most   limits were not spent- infull, and since prices generally rose more than had been allowed forwhen they were set, the shortfall in volume terms must have beengreater.     The cash limits seem therefore to have themselves imposedCONFIDENTIAL; 7.
a constraint;.     But some new or expanding programmes anyway aeveiopeumore slowly than planned.     This affected both cash-limited andother expenditure.     For example the unusually large shortfall of13 per cent in the programme for Trade, Industry and Employmentincluded substantial shortfalls on areas that are not cash-limitedsuch as assistance to industry, the not and refinancing of export and shipbuilding credit.     In the housing programme, much of whichwas not cash-limited, the longfalls of the previous three years were followed by a fairly substantial shortfall, including lower than expected demand for mortgages, delays in construction work and somesaving on subsidies with the sharp fall in interest rates late inthe year.     Bad weather in the latter part of the financial year isblamed for some of the shortfall on roads, hampering any attempts to catch up on what would have been possible under the cash limit.12.    In the estimates so far available, however,a relatively small part of the shortfall in 1976-77 was in fixed capital investment.The planned total of fixed investment for the year was about 5 Percent below the volume of expenditure in 1975-76v an acceleration of the fell that began in 1974-75? and this presumably limited, thescope for further slippage.     Host of the extra shortfall ley on current expenditure and to some extent on lending.     Table 3summarises the pattern of shortfall by economic category..NationaiiRod Industries13.   The issue of shortfall in relation to nationalised industriespresents special problems.     In the past, when their capital expendwas included in public expenditure, it was accepted that their plan&apos;were usually over-optimistic and the total for the programme wasstruck after deducting a special allowance for shortfall.     Even s0&apos;outturn was often below the net programme, though not in 1974-75 ^the recession led to massive increases in coal and steel stocks.14.   On the new basis, in which government grants and lending tothe industries are included in public expenditure, new uncertain-&apos; of;ties are introduced.&apos;    The figures depend not only on the industryexternal financing requirements (and some shortfall is allowed insumming them) but also on the distribution of their gross borrowing;between sources, whether to repay maturing debt or for net new ,borrowing.   The formal figure for government lending in 1976-77 Puin this year&apos;s White Paper was chosen to avoid disclosing plansabout further overseas borrowing by the&apos;CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL-industries, and for this and other reasons turned out to have been much too largerProspects for 1977-7815*   For the current year, the planning figures to be published inthe next V/hite Paper, with which outturn will later be compared, arenot yet decided.     So far as concerns central, government expenditurecovered by-the new inter-departmental Financial Information System,expenditure in the first part of the financial year has been some-what lower than initially expected by departments and the latestavailable forecasts of outturn are below the Survey baseline.     Itwill be desirable to minimise the eventual measure of divergencebetween plan and outturn^ as defined in this Annex, by up-dating the survey estimates before publication.Shortfall in future16.    The description of past shortfall has emphasised its variability.Looking ahead, two general influences can be noted.   First, the annual increases in public expenditure are lower than the growth in the earlier part of the. docadc, and actual expenditure could be expected to catchup with that planned.     Secondly, the greater emphasis on limits must-mean that managers will typically aim a little below them and therefore a central estimate of outturn will be below the total of permittedexpenditure; though it is to be expected that the shock effect ofthe introduction of cash limits will wear off as managers get more,used to working within them.     These two tendencies - greaterfeasibility in programme figures and more concern to avoid, over-spendings - tend in opposite directions, the first reducing and thesecond tending to re-instate the phenomenon of shortfall.     Inaddition, many of the particular causes of variation in past yearsmay recur.17*   No firm conclusion about the scale of shortfall in future ispossible.     It may however be reasonable to expect that actual expenditure in a typical year may differ from the latest publishedplan by no more than an amount in the range  -1 per cent.     Inpresent Survey prices this would be equivalent to a divergence of up to  275-550 million.CONFIDENTIAL
