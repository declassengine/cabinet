RESOURCES 11. None of these proposals has significant implications for public expenditure. The measure to require provisional licence holders to submit a training certificate would eventually have some manpower implications, it it has to be implemented. RECOMMENDATIONS 12. These three proposals, although they have the same purpose of saving human life, may provoke different reactions. In terms of results, seat belts is the most important but arouses freedom-of-the-individual arguments. This is not the case with drink-and-driving where the victim is often not the driver but a wholly innocent pedestrian. As for motor- cyclists, legislation might be thought simply to introduce measures of ordinary prudence which are taken for granted in other areas. I appreciate the problem of priorities for the legislative programme, especially in the run-up to a General Election. I nevertheless believe that the balance of advantage lies strongly in proceeding with comprehensive legislation as soon as possible. Accordingly, I invite the Cabinet to approve such legislation in principle with a view to proceeding in the next Session. W T R Department of Transport 18 July 1977
this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT CP(77) 84 19 July 1977 COPY NO CABINET WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Industry 1. In response to the Prime Minister's minute of 16 February, an official group, under Treasury chairmanship, has examined those Government policies which have implications for industrial performance in the light of our commitments in Cmnd 6315 (An Approach to Industrial Strategy) to identify the industrial implications of all our policies and to give priority to industrial development over consumption or even our social objectives. We attach a fiz st report by the group and a draft paper under which we could circulate it to the National Economic Development Council (NEDC). NEDC PAPER 2. The group reviewed the range of Government policies (other than those already covered by the Sector Working Parties (SWPs) which impinge on industry. It sought to identify action already taken to implement the new priority for industry, and was able to propose some new short-term initiatives; and to highlight the most important long-term objectives and problems. The group has also sought to produce a first list of proposals which will help to show in NEDC our willingness to stand by our White Paper commitment. 2. There is a problem underlying this deceptively simple ordering of priorities. Some of our "social" policies may contribute to industrial objectives - particularly some of our measures which have raised most difficulties for industry, for example our measures to make employees more secure, and our possible proposals on industrial democracy. To some extent this is simply a problem of time scale: there is a limit to how much legislative reform of industry can be implemented in a short period and we may well have reached it. More fundamentally, there is a real conflict between the view that, at least in the longer term, these initiatives will have a real economic pay-off through a better-trained and motivated workforce, and the view that they are one more unnecessary cost 1 CONFIDENTIAL
and diversion of management effort imposed on industry for political reasons. This problem cannot be resolved within the terms of the present exercise and the official group have had to arrive at their own view of which social policies are and which are not generally accepted as conducive to industrial efficiency. They have - rightly in our view - deliberately left aside certain important but particularly contentious areas mentioned in paragraph 5 below, which are so politically sensitive that any attempt to subsume theui within the industrial strategy at this stage would risk wrecking it. They also have not covered counter-inflation policy, vital as it is, because it is out3ide the framework of this exercise. Nevertheless, it was noted that botn pay and prices policy have major implications for industrial performance: it in vital for industry that inflation should be conquered, but pay and prices policy can create rigidities and impose additional administrative burdens. 4. The draft NEDC paper contains the following new commitments and proposals (other than undertakings to carry out studies): i. Proposals for adapting education in schools to ensure that school-leavers are fully equipped to play their part in an industrial society (paragraph 1. 2). ii. Statement of long-term objectives for the supply and use of qualified manpower in industry (paragraph 1. 7). iii. Undertaking to take more account in public sector manpower policies of implications for supply of labour to industry (paragraph 1.16). iv. A pilot scheme to Hnk local authority housing with vacancies for key workers (paragraph 2. 2). v. Undertaking to take account of nsed for industry to have a period of adjustment in considering any further employment legislation (paragraph 3.2). vi. Long-term objectives for taxation (paragraph 5.1). vii. Local authorities to give the needs of industry priority (paragraphs 6.1 and 6. 5). viii. Proposals for improving time taken on planning appeals (paragraph 6.1). ix. Undertaking to operate industrial development certificate and office development permit system flexibly (paragraph 6. 3). 2
x. Statement on energy tariffs for industrial consumers (paragraph 7.5). xi. Review of Government research and development to ensure as much as possible contracted in industry (paragraph 8. 4). xii. Undertaking on maximising the United Kingdom content of public purchases from United Kingdom suppliers (paragraph 10.1). xiii. Guidance to industry on competition policy and mergers which are consistent with the industrial strategy (paragraph 11.1). xiv. Commitment to substantial increase in Civil Service/industry exchanges (paragraph 1?. 3). It should be noted that acceptance of commitment xiv. implies that each Department - not just the Civil Service Department - will have to accept its share of the responsibility for ensuring that the increase is achieved. 5. For the reasons mentioned above the group thought it unhelpful to raise a number of issues which, while crucially important, are politically unapproachable on a tripartite basis at present. These are: i. Industrial democracy: the group did not feel it could add to the considerations already before Ministers. ii. Trade union structure: although there has been a significant reduction in the number of unions in recent years, some disputes are still the direct result of unsatisfactory union structure. Multi- unionism also causes extra difficulties in negotiation and additional industrial relations work which is an impediment to industrial efficiency. This serious long-term problem has been the subject of little public debate in recent years, although it is a continuing concern of the Trades Union Congress. Problems for industry are also sometimes posed by internal difficulties experienced by some unions, and by the fact that many unions are not well equipped eg in research capacity to deal with the problems of a modern industrial society. It is not clear that there is scope for a Government initiative at this stage, but the damaging effects of the present situation must be recognised. Although the group will consider these problems further, it did not consider it appropriate to raise the subject in the NEDC paper. iii. Housing policy: given the political sensitivity of this subject, the group did not consider it appropriate to raise it in the NEDC paper or to make recommendations to Ministers. The group noted, however, that there were substantial barriers to mobility in housing 3 CONFIDENTIAL
which could affect industrial regeneration and that, although the recent Green Paper put forward a number of proposals for easing the problem, there were no policies available for solving ic overnight. 6. The group noted a number of other areas which they wish to draw to the attention of Ministers: i. Labour supply: the group noted that various measures were being currently advocated to help resolve current employment problems by reducing labour supply. Some temporary measures, e. g. reducing overtime, may not conflict with the industrial strategy. Irreversible measures, e.g. a general shortening of the standard working week, could seriously damage the strategy by leading to difficulties of labour supply, and to increases in costs. The group attached importance to awareness of the dangers of such irreversible measures. ii. Burden of legislation: industrialists argue that a heavy burden has been imposed on managerial time by the volume of recent legislation affecting industry - particularly employment legislation. The group proposes that the NEDC paper should say no more than that this aspect should be taken fully into account when any further proposals in this field are under consideration, but it is particularly important that Ministers should keep in mind the industrial argument for a period of stability and consolidation in this field. The group also favoured in principle a proposal that all legislation should contain an estimate of its implications for industrial costs (including administrative and other indirect costs). However, it felt that more consideration needed to be given to how such a scheme might work in practice before any commitment could be given to NEDC. iii. Pollution: the interests of United Kingdom industry make it essential to continue to resist pressures in the European Economic Community (EEC) and elsewhere for the adoption of uniform emission standards in order to preserve the United Kingdom's natural competitive advantage in environmental matters stemming from its geographical position. iv. Heavy lorries: it is of considerable industrial importance to obtain EEC agreement on the harmonisation of maximum permitted lorry weights and dimensions, which would reduce transport co3ts and facilitate exports of lorries. It is recommended that objections from an environmentalist viewpoint - and the environmentalist arguments are not all one way - should not override this industrial strategy objective. 4 CONFIDENTIAL
v. Attitudes to industry: recent Ministerial speeches have had a helpful effect on attitudes (particularly of students) towards industry, and it is recommended that Ministers might intensify theii efforts to bring home to the public the critical wealth-generating function of industry. FUTURE WORK 7. The group's work has been carried out in a short time-scale, and has so far been principally a survey of the field, rather than an attempt to solve the many problems posed. One notable feature to emerge is the large number of Government policies with an important bearing on the performance of manufacturing industry. 8. With one or two exceptions, only very limited progress has been made by Departments towards making a reality of the Government's pledge to give a higher priority to industrial development. This is not surprising: a higher priority for industry means a lower priority for other desirable objectives, and such decisions are necessarily painful. The trend for decades has been to put social objectives first, and there is considerable inertia to be overcome before the accumulated policies and attitudes which have weakened our industrial base can be changed. However, we are convinced that we must succeed in this if our industrial objectives - and through them our social objectives - are to be attained, and that giving higher priority to industry across the whole range of our policies can make as great a contribution - perhaps greater - to industrial recovery as can more conventional forms of industrial policy. 9. We therefore propose that work in this area should continue, and that: i. The group, as a steering committee, should keep under review areas of policy posing long-term problems for industrial efficiency. ii. Major new policy proposals by Departments, which could impose significant burdens on industry, should be reviewed by the group to ensure that too great a cumulative burden is not placed on industry. iii. SWPs should be invited to take note of the work on wider implications and to give their views on priority areas for Government policy changes. iv. There should be regular general reports to NEDC on progress made on the wider implications of the industrial strategy. 5 CONFIDENTIAL
v. Ministers from the non-industrial Departments should attend NEDC from time to time to discuss their contribution to the industrial strategy. 10. We propose that the long-term problems which should in the first instance be the subject of further consideration should be: i. Employment of graduates by industry (paragraph 1. 9). ii. Public sector manpower policy (paragraph 1.15). iii. Social security and tax in relation to work incentives (paragraph 1. 22). iv. Effect of standards and specifications on export potential of products purchased by the public sector (paragraph 10. 3). v. Civil Service/industry mobility (paragraph 12. 5). vi. Burdens on industry (paragraph 12. 6). CONCLUSION 11. We recognise that NEDC may find this only a modest contribution, even as a first step. But we must not underestimate the importance of showing that we meant exactly what we said about industrial priorities in the 1975 White Paper. The fact is that there is no single, simple remedy for our problems within the field of industrial policy. We need to make and go on making a whole series of undramatic but, over the longer term, important adjustments to our policies with a view to giving United Kingdom industry the same degree of support as its competitors get from their own Governments. The proposals in the officials' report are a first contribution to this with suggestions about how it can be carried forward. If we are to keep the support of both sides of industry in the development of the industrial strategy we must be able to convince them that all parts of Government are fully committed to it.

CONFIDENTIAL ANNEX Draft NEDC Paper THE WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Industry Introduction 1. The relative decline in the performance of British manufacturing industry in the post-war period has been associated with a climate of opinion in the UK which has been at best indifferent and at worst hostile to the role of industry in society. There has been a widespread failure to recognise the key wealth-generating function of industry. This tendency is deeply rooted in our history, social structure and culture. Against this background, Governments more often than not have given priority to social objectives over industrial objectives, with the result - though unintentional - that industry has found it more difficult to function effectively and competitively. This tendency has meant that the men and women who work in our manufacturing industry - at all levels - have not been given adequate recognition of their importance by society, and that much of the best of our national talent has been directed towards non-industrial employment such as education, the public service, the City and the professions. Althoiighc^ors other tha* anuf acturing, , such as parts of the service sector, create wealth and contribute to our trading performance, it is our manufacturing industry, despite its concentration of capital, skills and traditional dominance, which has lagged most conspicuously behind our majorindustrial competitors. 2. The effort to check the decline in performance of manufacturing industry in the post-war period at first concentrated mainly on macro-economic policy making. More recently, action at the micro-economic or sectoral level has also been developing, particularly through the present work of the sector working parties. Hut action outside the traditional macro-economic/micro-economic framework is also necessary if manufacturing industry is to be regenerated. That is why the Government, in the November 1$75 White Paper "An Approach to Industrial Strategy", committed itself to identifying the industrial implications of the whole range of its policies and undertook to "give greater weight, and more consistently than hitherto, to the need for increasing the national rate of growth through regenerating our industrial structure and improving efficiency. For the immediate future this will mean giving priority to industrial development over consumption CONFIDENTIAL -1-
CONFIDENTIAL or even our social objectives. There is no other way of developing the industrial base on which the Government's whole programme of economic and social reform depends". 3. The attached paper is a first survey of the broad areas of Government policy (other than those directly covered by the work of the Sector Working Parties) which bear in one way or another on industrial performance and efficiency. The various policies have been grouped to reflect an industrial viewpoint, rather than to reflect Departmental categorisation. It also describes certain action already taken or now proposed to give a higher priority to the needs of industry, and makes proposals, subject to the views of the Council, on how this problem should be tackled in the longer term. It will be no easy matter to change the deeply rooted attitudes, and the accumulated policies, which have contributed to industrial decline, and the change will take many years: but the Government is determined to continue with this work. The objective is to ensure that Government policies as a whole give British industry at least the same degree of support, and as favourable an environment, as is given to their own industries by competitor countries. Future Action 4. The Government proposes, subject to the views of the Council, to carry out further revievisof areas of policy posing long-term problems for industrial efficiency. The long-term problems which should next be the subject of further consideration, as proposed in the attached paper, are: (i) employment of graduates by industry (paragraph 1.9); (ii) public sector manpower policy (paragraph 1.15); (iii) social security and tax in relation to work incentives (paragraph 1.22); (iv) effect of standards and specifications on export potential of products purchased by the public sector (paragraph 10.3); (v) civil service/industry mobility (paragraph 12.5); (vi) burdens on industry (paragraph 12.6). 5. In addition it proposes that: (i) Ministers from the non-industrial Departments should attend NEDC from time to time to discuss their contribution to the industrial strategy. A start was made last month when the CONFIDENTIAL -2-
CONFIDENTIAL Secretary of State for Education and Science and the Secretary of State for the Environment attended the Council; (ii) SWPs should be invited to take note of the continuing work on wider implications and to give their views on priority areas for Government policy changes; (iii) there should be regular general reports to the Council on progress made on the wider implications of the industrial strategy.
CONFIDENTIAL WIDEE IMPLICATIONS OF THE INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY REPORT BY OFFICIALS 1. The attached report has been prepared in accordance with a remit by the Prime Minister dated 16 February for a Group of officials under Treasury chairmanship to prepare a draft paper for NEDC on the linking of industrial to other policies. The Group included representatives of the Departments of Education and Science, Employment, Energy, Environment, Health and Social Security, Industry, Prices and Consumer Protection, Trade, Transport, and the CSD, CPRS, FCO, MAFF and MOD. 2.

CONFIDENTIAL LABOUR 1. The Supply of Labour to Industry 1.1 It is essential that a fair share of the nation's most able manpower - at all levels - is employed in manufacturing industry, and that their education, training and motivation are such that their ability can be fully utilised in industry. There is good reason to believe that this is not happening, and has not happened for a long time in the UK. A decisive shift of some of our most able manpower into manufacturing must be looked for if the regener- ation of industry is to be achieved and sustained. 1.2 Schools Education. The influence of the education system on the economic performance of the country has been an important theme in the current public debate on school education, in which representatives from both sides of industry have played a full part. /The Secretary of State for Education and Science has just published a consultative document "Education in Schools", setting out conclusions and proposals for further action. Among the points in this document7which are particularly relevant to the industrial strategy are the following: i. although there is some public criticism of the schools there is no clear evidence of a general decline in standards. In some schools the curriculum may have become overloaded to the detriment of essential skills, including literacy and numeracy. No other aims should divert attention from these essential elements of the curriculum; education area will ii. the balance and breadth of the school curriculum in each local/ be reviewed by local education authorities and their teachers, and industry and commerce will be involved in this process; to do more to iii. schools need/ prepare pupils for the transition to adult and working life, in particular by equipping them with a basic understanding of the functioning of the economy and activities, especially manufacturing industry, which create the nation's wealth; I iv. attention will be given to the development of methods of monitoring the performance of the school system, especially I in English, mathematics and science; CONFIDENTIAL I
UU1U' XLJiull XXiUl v. various steps will be taken to improve the quality of the teaching force eg by requiring applicants to teacher training to have minimum qualifications in mathematics and English, and by developing in-service and induction training. (In this connection the Secretary of State recently announced a special pro- gramme to train serving teachers or unemployed qualified teachers in subjects important to the industrial strategy); vi. encouragement will be given to the recruitment to teacher training of people who have had experience outside education; vii. attention must be given in initial teacher training to acquainting teachers with the national importance of industry and commerce and to helping them to convey this to their pupils; viii. local education authorities will in general need to develop more systematic approaches to the recruitment, career development, training and development of teachers, including procedures for assessment advice, and where necessary, early retirement; ix. communications between employers, trade unions and the school need to be improved especially at the local level. Joint efforts should relate to such matters as improving understanding of the importance to our national life of productive industry and trade; the provision of work experience as part of a school course; increased opportunities for people in industry to-visit schools, and teachers and pupils to visit factories; and the appointment of managers and trade unionists from industry as governors of schools; x. local education authorities, schools and industry should consider together how careers guidance can best be developed to ensure that young people get correct and up-to-date information about jobs and training opportunities in local industry. .Many schools will need to adjust their priorities to make room in the curriculum for careers education for all pupils not later than the age of 13. 1*3 Higher and Further Education. As far as higher education is concerned, the evidence suggests that the intake by manufacturing industry of graduates falls short in both quality and quantity. ^~The recently published consultation document "Industry, Education and Management", reviews in detail some of the evidence for reaching such a conslusion_7. Many SWPs have also drawn attention to shortages in the supply of skilled manpower, particularly qualified engineers and scientists. CONFIDENTIAL 2
CONFIDENTIAL i.k While there has been a substantial increase in the output of graduates entering employment over thepast 25 years, the proportion entering employment in the manufacturing sector has decreased from a 19oVpeak of 4/1% to 25.9% in 1975. The actual number of graduates recruited by industry has increased over the same period from ^f611 to 6098, but in recent years has varied widely from year to year, reflecting such factors as the fluctuations in the economic cycle and the fall in employment in the manufacturing sector: the general level of recrutiment in the 19?0's has been lower than in the peak years of the late 1960's, .(8238'in 1969). These figures.do not, however, reveal the final destination of the very large number of graduates who do not directly enter employment. The table below summarises an attempt to identify the sectors entered by all of those 1971 graduates known to have entered employment in the United Kingdom whether after obtaining their first qualification or later. It still relates to only about two-thirds of all 1971 university graduates: Percentage entering: Public Service 17 Education 40 Manufacturing Industry 18 Other Industry 8 Commerce 10 Other 6 100 1.5 The evidence covering the supply to industry of highly qualified manpower is, however, complex and difficult to interpret. It must be noted, for example, that the stock of graduates in industry has risen markedly and that graduates are spreading into occupational levels not traditionally associated with them. Supply considerations are likely to be prominent among the matters covered in a special report commissioned by the British Association for the Advancement f Science with Government support, which will be published this summer. The Government for its part is making a detailed factual study, making use of all available data including the experience f University Appointments Boards. 1.6 It is, however, generally agreed that the quality of the graduates recruited by industry should be improved; manufacturing 1ndustry in particular has not been attracting its proper share of
the most able young people in the country.   Engineering graduates,
of whom the large majority take jobs in industry, have tended in the
past to have on average   poorer A level qualifications than those in
most other subjects.   While industry gets its full share of the more
able amongst these graduates, a variety of factors including social
attitudes and the fluctuating patterns of recruitment by industry have
contributed to keeping the overall quality lower than it should be.
There is, however, evidence that the trend is beginning to change. An
apparent shift in attitude has led to both a marked upturn in the
number of applications for courses in engineering and science in
higher education, and an increased willingness on the part of
graduates to seek employment in industry.   There is also evidence
that industrial recruitment now is steadier and more buoyant, while
that of the public sector has abated.   The institutions of higher
education for their part have at present some spare capacity on
the science and engineering side, and though this may be fairly quickly
taken up, the opportunity exists for developing more courses with
a clear industrial slant.
1.7 The long-term objectives for ensuring an adequate supply and
use of highly-qualified manpower in industry must therefore be:
i. to increase the quantity and quality of the graduate
output seeking industrial employment;
ii. for industry - particularly small and medium-sized firms -
to alter its recruiting patterns to absorb more of the output
of higher and further education;
iii. to increase the account taken of industrial needs in the
planning of degree courses in universities and polytechnics;
iv. to increase the knowledge and understanding of industry
amongst teachers in higher education.
1.8 The following first steps towards these long-term objectives has
been taken:
i.       the DES has announced two financial incentives intended
to attract able students into courses of particular value to
industry:
a     a scheme (still to be worked out in detail) of
industrial scholarships to be run in collaboration
with industry.    The full support of industry will be
required if this scheme is to be successful, and the
Government hopes that progress can be made as fast
as possible;
CONFIDENTIAL
b        a modification of the awards arrangements to enable
employers to give  students financial  support up to
 500  (in addition to present disregard of  185) without
reduction of grant;
ii. in the post-graduate  sphere priority is being given to
the development of courses designed and run in close association
with industry;
iii. the University Grants Committee   (UGC) has invited
universities to make proposals for a number of first degree
courses  of very high quality,   perhaps lasting  k years, with
a pronounced orientation towards manufacturing industry, and
designed for  students likely to become  leaders  in their
profession and to move into senior levels of management;
iv. the UGC  and the Council for National Academic Awards are
also considering what kind of degree  courses can best meet
the needs of the  growing number of students who will  find their
way into a broad range  of jobs  in industry not traditionally
filled by graduates.
1.9    These  are,  however,   only the  first  steps,   and far-reaching
changes in attitudes and practices may be required before the
long-term objectives will be reached.    The Government will give
further consideration to  these problems in the light  of the
in para 1*5
statistical  survey mentioned/above,  and the British Association&apos;s
report.  The enquiry under Sir Montague Finniston into   the engineering profession
which was announced on h July will also be relevant.
1   10 Public  Sector Manpower Policy.    Many SWPs have  expressed concern
that the  public  sector is absorbing too great a  share of able man-
power,   particularly the well-qualified.     So  far,   the Government
has not  sought to adjust the  intake of qualified manpower to the
public  sector on the grounds of its impact on the  supply available
to industry.
1 11 As far as graduates are  concerned,   the proportion directly
entering employment who  entered the public  services (excluding
education)   rose  from  l4.8% in  1965  to  26.2% in  1975 but fell
back to 21.1% in  1976.    The recent decrease  in the  intake of
graduates by the  public   sector caused by public expenditure
constraints has been associated with   (although not necessarily the
s le cause of)  an increased number of graduates seeking industrial
etnPloyment.
CONFIDENTIAL I
1.12 Statistics relating to  other qualified people entering
public  services are not available,  but  estimates based on the 1971
Census of Population suggest that whereas 47 per cent of those
with degree and equivalent  qualifications  are  employed in the
public  sector   (ie public  services plus nationalised industries)
60 per  cent  of those with qualifications not  of degree  level but
usually obtained after the  age  of  l8   (a high proportion of which
are  in teaching and nursing but  also  include HNC  and HND) were
employed in that  sector,   as were  28 per  cent of those with GCE
A level  or equivalent qualification but no higher qualifications.
For  comparison,   slightly over a quarter of the  total population
were  employed in the public   sector in  1971-    The  skills exercised
at  the  technician and  craft  levels are much more  specific and
job-related  than those possessed by newly-qualified graduates.
The public and private  sectors are,   generally speaking, in
competition for those people only at a point when they leave school
and before  they are trained.
1.13 SWTs have in particular argued that, in many cases, manufacturing I
industry is unable to compete with the pay and conditions offered
by the public   sector.     If this were widely the  case,   there would
be  a formidable  combination of market  and cultural  forces which
would lead to the public  sector pre-empting qualified manpower in
disproportionate quality and quantity.
 
1.14 This is,  however,   an area where facts are difficult to
establish,  where  care must be  taken to  examine  comparable jobs,
and where  generalisations  are unlikely to be  valid.     It  is also
necessary to take account of the relativities between manufacturing
industry and  other parts of the  private sector.
1.15 The  Government believes  that  there  is reason to be concerned
at the possibility of pre-emption by the public  sector of resources
of able manpower at  the  expense of industry.     It  considers that
much more  account must now be  taken in public   sector manpower
policies of their implications for the  supply of labour to
industry,   and of relativities between the  public  sector and
industry where  they are  competing for  the  same  type  of manpower.
It proposes to conduct a more searching examination of the facts
about public sector recruitment of qualified manpower (including
pay relativities and other factors).
CONFIDENTIAL
1.16 Incentives  to Work.     It  is  important  from an industrial
viewpoint  that  the  taxation  system does not  distort  the labour
market  to  the  extent  that  the normal wage   structure  fails to
provide  an adequate  incentive  to work and to  gain  skills and
promotion.     Yet  there  is widespread feeling -  at all  levels -
that  the present  taxation  system has weakened  the  incentive to
work throughout the economy.
1.17 As  far as  the  lower  end of  the  labour market  is concerned,
a problem which has received much attention recently is  that of
the  relationship between  social  security and welfare  benefits for
those  out  of work and earnings  in work.    This problem is limited
in  size,   and  its  effects have been exaggerated.     But situations
do  exist  in which the  net  income  of  those unemployed or absent through
sickness  can,   at  least  for a period,   exceed their net earnings
while  in work,   and  that  for others,   the net additional reward from
working is very  small.    This problem is  caused not only by the
level  of benefits,   but  also by features of the  tax  system (low
threshholds,   and refunds  of tax for  those  out  of work).    As well
as  the  disincentive  effect  on those  not  in work,   the perception
of this problem can be  demoralising for  those  in work.
1.18 A  closely related,   but  separate,   problem is  that  of the
&quot;poverty trap&quot;  which affects  those  in work,   and which flows from
the  combination of current  taxation levels and means-tested
benefits.     This  does not  in practice  mean,   as  is widely supposed,
that  those  affected derive  no net benefit  from normal pay increases,
because  the  income  limits  for means  tested benefits are regularly
uprated and  thus move up as pay moves up.     But  it  does mean that
there  is  a wide band of low earnings  over which net  income increases
little  if at  all.     For example,   for a married man with 2 young
children  claiming all  the  available benefits,   total net income
does not  increase  at  all between gross  earnings  of  30 and  ^5
a week,   and increases by less  than  5 between  ^5  and  60. There
is  therefore  little  incentive  in this  income  range  for a worker
to  increase his  earnings  -  for example  through working overtime,
or through gaining  skills or promotion,   or through a  change  of job.
in post-tax pay
1.19 There has been a  long-term tendency for differentials/between
skilled and less  skilled work  to be  compressed.     As far as
managerial  pay is  concerned,   several  surveys have  shown that
managerial pay,   in the UK,   is  in general   substantially lower than
m other major  industrial  countries;   though a large  part of this
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
simply reflects the overall difference in GDP per head, it has
undoubtedly made overseas employment and emigration increasingly
attractive to the more mobile and talented managers.   The DOI&apos;s
contacts with both US and UK multinationals confirm that they are having
increasing difficulty in persuading UK nationals to return to the UK
after service abroad because of the weight of direct taxation and lower
salaries common here.
1.20 International comparisons of income taxation are never straight-
forward, partly because of the difficulty of establishing an acceptable
basis of currency translation and partly because of the variation in
the distribution of earnings.   The relative importance of social
security contributions, the tax treatment of the family unit and other
allowances will also vary widely.    It is fairly clear, however, that
UK marginal and effective rates of tax are high by international
standards, particularly for earnings substantially below and above the
average.    For example, in the UK a married man with two children,
earning half the average production worker&apos;s wage, will be paying tax
although his counterparts in France, West Germany, the Netherlands,
the USA and Japan pay no tax.    Similarly, in the UK a family man on
five times average earnings surrenders nearly 50% of his income in
tax (assuming the complete package of reliefs proposed in the Budget),
at a marginal rate of 75%, while the equivalent taxpayer in France
pays only 16% and in Germany, the USA and Japan about 35% (including
local income tax where appropriate).    At this level of earnings the
Netherlands is closest to the UK with about the same average rate but
a slightly lower marginal rate.    Only in Sweden are marginal and
average rates higher than in the UK.
1.21 The long-term objective must be to restore a situation in
which - at all levels - the labour market can operate effectively
and provide adequate incentives to work, while continuing to give
protection to the poorer members of society.   The inter-relation of
social security benefits and tax is, however, an area of great
complexity, where generalisations can be facile and where solutions
may be difficult to find.
1.22 The Chancellor of the Exchequer has given a commitment, as far
as circumstances permit, to reduce the burden of income tax at all levels,
and to increase the level of personal tax allowances to the point where
they stand above the levels of the main social security benefits, and a
start was made in the last Budget.    Moreover, the Government intends to
give further consideration to the question how far the interaction of the
tax and social security system creates disincentives to work at lower
CONFIDENTIAL    -8- levels of earnings.

2        Mobility of Labour
2.1 The  Government remains  committed  to  its  efforts  to  ensure through
regional  policy that  jobs  can go  to workers  in areas of high
unemployment.     But  even in an economy with no regional imbalances,
it would remain nacessary to  ensure  that workers with particular
skills  can easily move  to the particular vacant  jobs requiring those
skills.     Even with the  present high levels of unemployment, many
cases are being reported by SWPs of  shortages of key  skilled workers.
The machinery exists  in  the Employment Service Agency for
circulating particulars of vacancies and of available labour
throughout  the  country and  this machinery is at present being
modernised using  the  latest  computerised techniques.
2.2 Housing and Industrial Mobility.     Housing policy can greatly
assist  industrial regeneration by making it  easier  for people to
move house  to new jobs.    This was recognised  in the  recent Green
Paper on housing policy.    Many of its proposals vill help; in
particular,   wider access  to home  ownership;   more  flexible allocation
and transfer policies  in the  local  authority  sector   (especially the
ending of residential  qualifications  for access  to waiting lists);
further  support  for  the  growth of housing associations and new forms
of tenure;   and measures  to  sustain the  supply of   &apos;quick access&apos;
accommodation in  the  private  rented  sector.     Local authorities
will be  encouraged  to  think  comprehensively about  the needs of labour
mobility in preparing  the  new local housing  strategies  each year;
and  central  Government will be  able  to  take  their proposals into
account  in allocating capital resources.     A pilot  scheme  is being
set up to  link local  authority housing with vacancies  for key
workers  so  that  these  can be  advertised by the ESA  in other areas
with an offer of local  authority accommodation;   and the Royal
Commission on Legal  Services  is  examining the  cost of conveyancing
of owner-occupied houses.
2.3 Transferability of Pensions.    While  there  are  no statutory
obstacles  to voluntary transfer of pension rights,   there  are certain
practical  difficulties which may,   in  some  cases,   impede occupational
labour mobility.    The  Secretary of State  for Social  Services intends
to  invite  the  Occupational Pensions Board
to  study the  question of
transferability as soon as practicable.
CONFIDENTIAL

3.       Employment Legislation
3.1 Recent years have seen a large amount of employment legislation
such as:
Equal Pay Act, 1970;
Industrial Relations Act, 1971;
Contracts of Employment Act, 1972;
Employment and Training Act, 1973;
Health and Safety at Work Act, 1974;
Trade Union and Labour Relations Act,   1974 and 1976;
Sex Discrimination Act, 1975;
Employment Protection Act,   1975 
Proposals for occupational pensions and  industrial democracy
legislation are also under consideration.
3 2    The Government  is  convinced that  its major reforms are both
necessary and  desirable.     If employees  -  and unions -  feel more
secure,   they are more  likely to  co-operate  to  increase productivity
and efficiency.     However,   given the  volume  of these  measures, a
period of adjustment  is required by both management and trade unions
and the Government will  take  full account  of this  in considering
any proposals  for further legislation  in this  field.    The Department
of Employment has also arranged for two pieces of research to be
carried out  on the  impact  of recent measures on employers, in
particular  to  establish whether  there  is validity in the view
that  these measures have made  employers more  reluctant  to  take on
new labour.
CAPITAL
4.      Cost  and  availability of capital
4.1    Since  last  autumn,   interest rates have  fallen very  substantiall)
by about  7-5% at  the  short  end and about  3% at  the  long end. The
main questions relating to the cost and availability of capital are
kept under review by the Roll Committee, and the Wilson Committee is
examining the whole area of institutional arrangements for
providing finance  for  industry;   therefore  these are not discussed
in this paper.
CONFIDENTIAL
10
CONFIDENTIAL
4.2    The  Government  is,   however,   concerned that  the banks should
show a proper understanding of the needs  and  importance of
industry,   just  as   (as  is  discussed elsewhere  in this paper)   it is
concerned  that  the  civil  service and education  should  show a proper
understanding  of industry.    The  Government therefore wishes  to see
an increasing involvement  of the banks in the  industrial strategy
and welcomes  the  addition of bank representatives as members of SWPs.
5  Taxation
5-1    Detailed  questions  on taxation  (such as  the  future  of the stock
relief  scheme)   are not  appropriate  to  a  discussion of the wider
implications  of the  industrial  strategy.     However,   it  is appropriate
here  to  emphasise  that  the  Government&apos;s  long-term taxation objectives
include:
i. maintaining  stability and  continuity of the corporate
tax system,   to  strengthen business planning and confidence;
ii. reducing the burden of direct personal  taxation at all
levels,   and  achieving a better balance between direct and
indirect taxation;
iii. reducing the  complexity of the  tax  system  (which at
present  places a heavy administrative burden on industry and
on Government).
Moreover,   the  Government  considers  it an  important objective to
create  an environment which promotes  innovation  (eg by measures to
assist  small  firms).    These  objectives  constitute  an appropriate
fiscal background  to  the  industrial strategy.
PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION
6   Infrastructure
^ l    Planning and Land.     A number of SWPs have  drawn attention to
the  danger  that planning procedures may obstruct  the industrial
strategy,   either because  too  little  priority is placed on the need
^ r industrial  development  or because  of the   slowness and complex-
ity of planning procedures     (which,   it has been alleged,   delay industr-
ial development much more  than  is  the  case  in other countries).
The Government has  taken the  following steps:
CONFIDENTIAL
11CONFIDENTIAL &apos; j
i. as  described  in the  paper put  to  the Council last
month by the  Secretary of State  for  the  Environment, it
has asked  local authorities  now to  give  industry top
priority in the handling of planning applications  and in
making land available for development and to be particularly
sensitive  to  the  needs  of  small  firms  in both urban and
rural areas;
ii. as far as the Department of the  Environment itself
is  concerned,   matters relating to  industrial  development, includ-
ing appeals and building regulations  jurisdiction,   will now
be  given first priority.    While  average  times  for  the handling
of planning appeals by the Department have  almost halved in
the  last  two years,   the  Government  is  determined to achieve
an even greater improvement.    The Department therefore proposes
for the future to give priority to the handling of all
industrial planning appeals.     It  also  aims  to  transfer to
inspectors  all  industrial planning appeals relating to buildings
up to   1500  sq metres,   as opposed  to  the  existing upper limit
of 500  sq metres.    With  these  changes,   the Department
considers  that  it  could work to a period of  5 months as the
normal maximum for  the handling of most  industrial planning
appeals,   with not more  than about one  case  in five exceeding
that  figure.    That  proportion  cannot be  eliminated because
the handling of a  planning appeal  depends on co-operation by
the  local authorities and the  applicant,   and also  on the amount
of local  opposition that may be  generated.     Highly contentious
or large  applications  for  industrial planning permission are
often called  in by  the  Secretary of State  as  the most
satisfactory way of handling them.    The  times  for  such cases
are not included in the references above and  they would
normally exceed five months.     Special  considerations apply
also  to mineral extraction cases.    Steps are being taken
within DOE  to  speed up  the handling of  such  cases but many of
them are  complex and will continue  to present difficulties;
iii. the Secretary of State  for Scotland has published a
consultation paper on  the  general operation  of the planning
system in Scotland:   this  includes possible means  of speeding
up the handling of planning applications.     He  also proposes
discussions with the  local  authorities,   STUC  and CBI on the
industrial  strategy which will  include,   among other things,
CONFIDENTIAL
12 _J
CUJNf&apos;IDENTlAlj
consideration of the ways in which the planning system
might assist industry;
iv.     similar steps   to those of DOE are being taken by the
Secretary of State  for Wales.
6.2 The  Government  is  considering whether research can be
undertaken  to monitor the  effects of the  above measures.
6.3 Industrial Development Certificates   (IDC&apos;s)   and Office
Development Permits   (ODP&apos;s).    While  the  Government  is committed
to retaining these  instruments as an essential  part  of regional
policy,   it made relaxations  in the  IDC   scheme  in  1976,   and has
now announced relaxations  in the ODP  scheme   (which also impinges
on manufacturing industry).     It undertakes to  operate both schemes
in as flexible  as possible  a manner  in  the  interests of the
industrial strategy.
6.4 Building Regulations.     Industry also has a  close  interest in
the  speedy handling of applications  for building regulations
approval.    Work is at present being undertaken:
i. to develop a more flexible and time-saving procedure for
building regulation;
ii. to  examine  the  scope  for rationalisation of the building
regulations and other legislation relating to buildings,
particularly  in respect  of measures against fire.
6.5 Roads.     One  of the  principal  objectives  for  future transport
policy set  out  in the Government&apos;s White Paper  (Cmnd 6836)   is to
contribute  to  economic  growth and higher national  prosperity by
giving industry and other  sectors of production an efficient
transport  service.    To  this  end  the  Government  will give
priority within the national road programme  to  improvements on
routes which  serve  the main industrial  areas  and  the ports.
Industrial  traffic will  also  benefit  from the  road  schemes chosen
to  serve regional needs and those designed to take heavy traffic
out of built up areas.     As  far as local Government  is concerned,
authorities have  been asked by the  Government  to reflect the
priority for  industry in their  traffic  management policies and in
their choice of road schemes.
CONFIDENTIAL
13
CONFIDENTIAL
6.6    Public Transport.     Adequate  public  transport  services are
essential if the labour force  is to be properly matched with
available  employment,   and if shift working is to be  feasible. In
its White Paper on Transport Policy,   the  Government re-affirms
its belief that the maintenance of an effective network of bus
services is an important aim of its transport policy and makes
provision for a  substantial and  continuing  commitment  to financial
support.    The White Paper rejects any notion of imposing major
cuts in the railway system,   and sets out the main tasks for the
railways,  of which the  carriage of people to and from work in
London and  the major  conurbations,   and the  carriage  of bulk
freight especially between  sidings,   are particularly material
to this paper.
7        Production and Distribution Costs
7.1    Pollution Policy.    The UK&apos;s geography and climate gives it
an environment which  can more  easily absorb and  disperse pollution
than the  environments  of many continental countries.
The Government therefor!
reaffirms  its  determination to resist  EEC  and other international
proposals for uniform emission  standards  in place  of the existing
UK quality objectives approach, which is preferable on both economic
and environmental grounds.
7-2    As  far as  existing UK practices  are  concerned,   the Government
does not  consider that  these  in general  are  imposing an unreasonable
burden on industry.    However,   there may have been cases where too
abrupt  changes or   inconsistent  decisions have been to  the detriment
of industry.    The Government:
i. has asked local authorities to  cease  imposing planning
conditions  in an attempt  to  deal with problems which are the
subject of controls under separate legislation;
ii. will make greater efforts to keep export industries in
touch with international moves towards higher environmental
standards.
7 3 Energy Policy. General energy policy issues have recently
been the subject of separate discussion in NEDC. A Green Paper
on Energy Policy will be published later this year.
CONFIDENTIAL I
1 I
ONFIDENTIAL
7-4    A matter of concern to  a number of SWPs has been that of
energy pricing policy.     In general,   the  Government  considers that
the prices  to  industry of  electricity,   coal,   gas and oil  do not
compare unfavourably  with price  levels  in other European countries,
and that  the  objective  of proper economic pricing is  in the best
long-term interests of industry as well  as  the  economy in general.
7.5 It  is  sometimes  argued  that,   in order to hold down prices for
the  domestic  sector,   there has  in the  past been  a degree  of cross-
subsidisation   within     energy tariffs and prices against industrial
consumers.     In fact  for a number of years both domestic and
industrial  tariffs were well below economic  levels.    The move
towards proper economic pricing has,   however,  been accompanied by
a better general balance between industrial and domestic prices
and tariffs.    The Government welcomes this move,  and would not
wish for the  future to see   discrimination against industrial
consumers.
7.6 The real price of energy is,  however,  bound to rise over the
longer  term.    The return to  industry from energy conservation
projects is  therefore equally certain to be increasingly large.
The Government hopes  that  the Council wi11 use  its  influence to
persuade  industrialists  of  the benefits for  them,   as well  as for
the nation,   in undertaking  investment  in energy conservation.
&apos; 7 Transport Costs. Two EEC issues could have important consequences
for transport costs:
i. the new proposals  for harmonization of maximum permitted
lorry weights and dimensions   (which,   if agreed,   would reduce
the  costs of road freight);
ii. the introduction of EEC rules on commercial drivers&apos; hours
(the increase in costs will be severe unless we can achieve the
staged programme  of  implementation for which we  are  negotiating).
 he Government will attach particular  importance  to  the industrial
implications  in its approach to  these  two issues.
&apos; 8    The  Government&apos;s  intention to  increase  taxation  on heavy lorries
ls in line with the principle  of covering full  economic costs.
However,   it will  continue  to  give  full  consideration to the views
CONFIDENTIAL
1 S
CONFIDENTIAL
of industry in deciding on the pace  of increase  in this
taxation.
7.9    Water Charges.    Water authorities are under a statutory
obligation to  set charges high enough to break even.    They are
also required to fix charges with regard to  costs,   and to avoid
undue  discrimination between different  classes of consumers.
This effectively precludes them from discriminating in favour of
industry:  nor is it reasonable that they should,   since they
could only do  so at the expense of the domestic  consumers for
whom water  services  charges  are  already a  sensitive  issue  in the
context of counter-inflation policy.     Some  industries have
complained of particular difficulties arising from increases in
trade effluent  charges,   especially where  charges had been kept
artificially low in the past and are now being increased as a
result of the general move  towards equalisation within regions
industries
(agreed  in principle with the CBI).   These/ are considering
jointly with the  water industry ways  and means of  solving these
problems.
8 .      Research and Development
8.1 A number of recent policy initiatives have borne  out the
Government&apos;s determination to encourage R&amp;D in industry. Selective
assistance under Section 8 of the  Industry Act   1972,   has included
provision for product  development assistance,   and /this  is being
extended under the Process and Product Development Scheme which
has recently been announced/-     On a  smaller  scale,   the Manufacturing
Advisory Service  announced in April,   to which  8 million has been
allocated over 5 years,  will help smaller and medium sized firms
in manufacturing industry,   especially those  engaged  in metal
working and assembly,   to make better use  of proven technologies.
8.2 Through such schemes the Government aims to assist industry
to  carry through  its own research and development.    The management
of the Government&apos;s own research and development  also has an
important role  to play.     In the research  council   sphere special
efforts are being devoted  to  the  development of research in areas
likely to  be  of  special value  to  industry.     For example,   in science
the  resources devoted  to  &quot;big science&quot;   (high energy physics,
astronomy and  space  science)  are being cut back by 25% to preserve
scope  for initiative  in other fields   (eg polymer engineering,
marine  technology and mineral exploration).
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
8.3    The   eight   Requirements  Boards which  commission research work
on behalf of the Department  of  Industry aim to  increase  the number
of contracts placed  in industry or  industry  supported research
associations,   rather  than  &quot;in-house&quot;.     In aggregate  the Boards
plan to  commission from industry k0% of the  work over  the next
few years.    This  can be  compared to  the  following proportions over
the last  k years:
1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77
12.7%	12.9%	17.2%	2 1.9%
Some work will of course continue to be done by the Department&apos;s
own Industrial Research Establishments. However, the Government
recognizes the importance of getting the fruits of this work out
into industry for industry to develop as early as possible.
8.4 Moreover,   all Government  departments which  sponsor technical
developments have been asked to  review arrangements  to  ensure that
as much as possible  of the work is  done   in  industry rather than
&quot;in-house&quot;.
8.5 The Advisory Council  on Applied Research and Development (ACARD)
has now been established under the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s chairmanship.
Its work programme  is  specifically directed  towards  the industry-
related aspects of R&amp;D.     It will,   inter alia,  be  considering the
Government&apos;s role  as a  commissioner of R&amp;D and how full industrial
benefits  can be  gained  from this.

9*1    Metrication.    The  Government has now put  forward a metrication
programme  as  a basis  for  consultation,   and recognizes  the industrial
importance  of the  implementation of metrication being completed as
rapidly as possible.
9.2    Standardization.    The  Government  is  urgently following up the
recommendations addressed  to  it  in the Warner Report,   which will
be  the  subject of a  separate  report  to  the Council.

11. Competition Policy
11.1    Competition policy has  an important role  to play,   as part of
the  industrial  strategy,   in  improving  the performance  of British
industry.    The  Government  is reviewing,   in particular, the
consideration to be  given  to mergers  resulting from restructuring
initiatives which are  consistent with the  industrial strategy
and will be providing guidance on this to industry.
12. Relations with Government
12.1 Civil  service/industry mobility.     It  is widely held that the
British practice  of offering a  full life  career in the Civil
Service,   and  of little mid-life recruitment,   leads  to a lack of
mutual understanding between the Service  and industry,   and therefore
a failure  to  give  enough weight  to industry&apos;s interests and
concerns when policy is being formulated.     Recognising that there
is a degree of truth in this,   the Government and the CBI alike for more than
a decade have accepted interchange postings between the Civil Service and
industry as an aim of policy. By
continuous  effort  on both  sides  something has been achieved, but
not  on a  large scale.
12.2 Between   1973  and   1975,   for  instance,   some  35  civil servants
have  undertaken exchange postings to  industry and  commerce, and
similarly  some 70   people  from the private   sector have  done spells
in the  Service  -  mainly at middle management level.    On  top of
these  figures,   some  60 recruits via  the  direct  entry Principal
competition have  joined  the  Service  in  the  last  5 years  in mid-life
after industrial  and  commercial  experience.     Despite  strong opposition
from the Civil  Service unions  this line  of recruitment  is being
maintained even in present  circumstances of manpower cuts. Its
benefits  are  cumulative,   and  nearly all  of those recruited  stay in
the  Service,   so  the  total  from this background continues  to grow.
Further industrial and  commercial  experience has also been imported
by recruitment from outside for posts where  specific prior experience
is necessary or highly desirable.
12.3 Nevertheless,   the Government  considers  that  it  is very
important  to  achieve  a much higher  degree  of interchange between
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL .
the Civil Service and industry,   and to promote a much greater
degree of mutual understanding on both sides.    Although there
are very real difficulties in    arranging exchange postings, they
represent  the best  short-term prospect  of further improvement.
The Government therefore proposes to achieve a sharp and substantial
increase  in the number of civil  servants  seconded  to industry.
More  secondments of businessmen  into  the Civil Service would also
be  desirable   (although the  flow of  secondments  need not balance
either locally or  generally).    This  is likely to prove more
difficult  than  secondments  in the  other  direction because able
businessmen run greater risks  than civil  servants  of jeopardising
their careers  if they leave  them for  crucial periods,   and problems
of pay and  conflict of interest  can also  arise.    These  aims cannot,
however,   be  achieved without  the  active  co-operation of industry,
and the Government therefore proposes to hold talks with the CBI
and leading firms  to  seek their assistance  in achieving substantial
increases  in the  number  of secondments.
12.4 There  are attractions  in making the  secondments rather shorter
than the usual  2-3 years.    This  can usefully increase  the number of
peo pie who have had direct experience  in commerce and industry,
while also reducing the  degree of sacrifice the parent organisation
has  to make.    This  change  can be  associated with linking the
secondment  to  a  specific  project,  which has a number of advantages.
This approach has already been tried  successfully on a  small scale.
It  could well be  a  significant  component  in the  further expansion
of  secondments.    The use  of joint  seminars   (which have already
proved useful)  will be  extended.    The wider use of training
processes,  within the Service or in co-operation with the business
school,   is in hand.
12.5 However,   the  Government  considers  that  the  question of
civil service/industry mobility requires further consideration in
the longer term.    This may involve rethinking of issues which
go much wider  than the matter of secondments.
12.6 Burdens on Industry.     It  is  frequently alleged by
industrialists  that  the  cumulative burden of Government requirements
such as collection of information,   the  complexity of the tax system,
planning delays and legislative  requirements  -  imposes unreasonable
costs on industry,   particularly on  smaller firms,   and damages
CONFIDENTIAL
20

efficiency.    The Government therefore proposes,  as a first
step,   to arrange for a fact-finding exercise to be carried
out to assess the total burden of Government legislative and
administrative  requirements on  some representative firms.
