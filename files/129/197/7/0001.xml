At the meeting of Cabinet on 7 July (CM(77) 24th Conclusions,Minute 7) the Prime Minister, in his summing up of the discussion on family Support, said that the Cabinet were unable to reach a conclusion on what the level of increase in Child Benefit (CB) should be without a clearer picture of the effect of increasing CB on eligibility of families for relief from other charges and that they would need to resume their discussion on 14 July.2. The attached note on the interrelation between CB and means-testedbenefits has been agreed between officials of the Department of education and Science, the Department of the Environment, the Department of health and Social Security and the Treasury.Signed    JOHN hunt cabinet Office12 July 1977
NOTE BY OFFICIALS ON THE INTEREELATION BETWEEN CHILD benefits and MEANS-TESTED BENEFITSMinisters have asked for more information about the interrelation&quot;between child benefits and means-tested benefits.   The followingnote has been agreed between officials of the Department of education and Science, the Department of the Environment, the Department ofHealth and Social Security and the Treasury.background.     GEN 82 agreed on child benefit - a universal cash benefit - asthe right course for improving family support in 1978-79.    The main reason for this was to achieve equity between those with differentfamily responsibilities at given income levels and not for reasons connected with the relief of poverty.    This reflected the arguments in the agreed study by officials and in the summary of that studyannexed to the report from GEN 82.    Both also pointed out that onlya small proportion of the expenditure on child benefit would helppoor families and that families already on means-tested benefits would receive comparatively little or no net benefit from a childbenefit increase.    The relevant paragraphs of the study by officials and its summary are attached at Annex A.interrelation with means-tested benefits3.     Eligibility for means-tested benefits is by definition affected-&quot;oy any increase in means (income).    In this respect the effect of anincrease in child benefits (as in the past with family allowances)3-s no different in principle from that of an increase in any otherhon means-tested benefit.   The precise way in which the assessment of particular means-tested benefits needs to be adjusted will,however, vary from benefit to benefit, depending, for example, on whether the benefit is assessed on a gross or net income basis.!*     Thus, while a family on supplementary benefit would get, undera*ny of the child benefit options, more by way of child benefit and less by way of supplementary benefit, the total from both would bedecided by the amount of the supplementary benefit scale.   In thecase of all the main means-tested benefits for families in work
(family income supplement, the housing benefits, free school meal3and free welfare milk), it will be necessary to take account of ^eeffects of any increase in child benefit;    but in practice the meapsscales for those benefits also have to be reviewed and upratedregularly in any case so as to protect the groups for whom theyare designed and to contain, as far as possible, the poverty trap-Complex adjustments in some existing schemes will, however, benecessary if net losses are to be avoided.5.     The precise adjustments to the various means-tested benefit and, what is more important, the net effect of the various adjn^    ,taken together,- on a family with children dependent on several 0cannot be worked out until the rate of child benefit and the aaou0of the reduction in child tax allowances (CTAs) are known.    Thisprecondition to further work.3maHefConclusions6.     In the light of the above officials are agreed in advisingi. The problems of the interrelationship between childbenefit and means-tested benefits do not affect the choicof child benefit rates except to the extent that the hiSrate of child benefit for any given level of CTAs thethe likelihood of net loss for recipients of means-testeabenefits and the less any resulting adjustment required-The problems in principle were recognised when ministers were considering the rates of child benefits last year -      tMinisters then accepted the view of the Secretary of State ^Social-. Services-and&apos; the Chief Secretary that the relation between the child benefit rates under consideration anamain means-tested benefits for families in work &quot;is aseparate and subsequent question, which does not affeccchoice of Child Benefit rates now&quot;.ii. Officials would expect the arrangements to be made &apos;the rate of child benefit, and. the reduction in CTAs, a*esettled to reflect, as for the current year, the gener8objective of ensuring that the net disposable resourcesfamilies on means-tested benefits are not reduced,bysignificant amounts, but it will be for individual2oi
COKPIDENTIALDepartments to work out the precise changes if any in theschemes for which they are responsible.7-     As an illustration of the kind of adjustments involved, thearrangements for the first phase of the introduction of child benefits from last April are at Annex B.    They do not, of coursedetermine the pattern for the arrangements to operate from April1973 which may be more complex not least because the effect ontake-home pay for most families will be greater.
NOTE BY &quot;OFFICIALS ON THE INTERRELATIOn BETWEEN child benefits AND MTBs(a)   Para 5 of the summary of the aim fly ty officialsannexed to the report hy GEN 82.&quot;If the aim is to relieve poverty among low incomefamilies, then improving universal family support wouldnot be a cost-effective approach, since only 15 per cent of child benefit expenditure is of assistance to poorfamilies (and oven this figure takes no account of thosewho get no net benefit because of the interaction of child benefit&quot; with means-tested benefits).    The purposeof universal family support is rather to achieve equitybetween those with different family responsibilities atgiven income levels (ie.   &quot;horizontally&apos;)&quot;.(b)   -Extract from paragraph 16 of the study by offic ials.&quot;A large proportion (over a third.) of poor child benefit-recipients are dependent on other social security benefits.Given that the dependency additions for children paid withthese benefits are abated, by the amount of any childbenefit increase to eliminate any net gain in income whichwould otherwise occur, child benefit does not help thesefamilies.    If households with children receiving other social security benefits (here comprising long and short-term NI benefits and Supplementary Benefit) are excluded,then poor households receive only 15 per cent of current expenditure on child benefit.    A similar abatement is madein means-tested benefits, although for technical reasonssome small net gains may have to be accepted in order toensure that no-one is worse off as a result of an increasein chi 1 d benef it,!.ANNEX A
ANNEX BINTRODUCTION OF CHILD BENEFIT LI APRIL 1977HEESactJSSIuHS ON M&amp;N5-TESTED BENEFITS1.     The following measures were taken to ensure that working familic-means-tested benefits were not worse off as a result of the introductionof child benefit in April 1977.2.     FAMILY INCOME SUPPLEMSIJT (FIS)Problem:   The gross value of child benefit would be taken intoaccount and, because of the 50jS FIS taper, FIS would bereduced by half the gross value of the now benefit.   For tax-paying families this reduction would exceed the net value of child benefit:.Solution:    Child benefit was wholly disregarded for FISpurposes;    to avoid overcompensation, the step in the prescribedamount for children after the first was reduced by CI , from 4.50 to  3.30.   The result was that no family lost FIG nor didany family have their ITS reduced;    and taken together withchild benefit, all FIS families gained between 30p and  1 a week for the first child and 20p or 30p (depending on round in-; to the nearest 10p) for each additional child.on.HOUSING BENEFITS (FOUNT AND RATES REBATES AND RENT ALLO AIJCSS)Problem:   This scheme, like PIS, is.based on gross incomeassessment.   The modification to PIS meant that almost allfamilies receiving housing benefits and FIS wore protected fromloss;   but some 2,000 two-parent one-child PIS families payingtax could have; lost 3p per week.   In addition, another small group of non-FIS families (about 2,000-3,000, irrespective ofmake-up or size) receiving housing benefits only could have lost3p per week.Solution:   These potential losses could have been eliminatedonly if 10p of child benefit had been disregarded for the housingbenefits scheme.   Apart from structural objections, this wouldhave cost about  500,000 a. year.    The decision was that no special steps need be taken to avoid this small loss.
4.*    FBES SCHOOLProblem:   Because no family lost FIS as a result of receivingchild benefit, there was no problem for families receiving freeschool meals on tho FIS passport.   But some non-FIS familiesreceiving free school meals by direct claim could have lost thev.&apos;hcle of that benefit ii&apos; the net increase from child benefitraised tho family income above the limit.Solution;   Tho Department of Education and Scionce made &quot;finelytuned&quot; regulations disregarding the not increase in incomederived from child benefit (i.c. after taking account of the changes in child tax allowances, rent and rotes rebates andrent allowances).5.     FHK5 YELFAH3 MIL?&apos; ;i!D \1TAI.IIN3 &apos;Problem:   Aa with fret; school meals, these bcnofi-,2 can beobtained on the FIS passport and the Flo proposals automaticallyprotected from net income loss families receiving those benefits.But for families not on ?JS and claiming these benefits directlyon   rounds of low income, tho net income increase followingreceipt of child benefit could have pushed them over tho oualifyiA5in c one limi t.Solution:   Existing discretionary powers were used to ensure thatall families receiving free welfare milk and vitamins on grounds of low income were protected from net income loss.6.     SUPPLrJMSfji^AHY BENEFITProblem:    A small number of families ceased to qualify for supple-mentary benefit as a result of receiving child benefit:    they therefore lost their passport to free school meals and free wolfs1,milk and vitamins.   They also fell&quot;outside the scone of theelectricity discount scheme.Solution:   These families continued to receive the &quot;passport&quot;benefits by direct claim on grounds of low income,   bpoc-ial nrrmwmeet;; were mode to ensure; that they were not excluded from theelectricity discount scheme.
