IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT82CP(77) 71 COPY NO1 July 1977CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE:  ACTION TO ASSIST THECONSTRUCTION industry memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment* Two major problems face the construction industry:  the first lack oforders;  the second, instability of demand.    We need to deal with both ofthese in order to reduce unemployment and maintain capacity in the industry,and to make construction work cheaper.STATE OF THE INDUSTRY^* The industry is in major crisis.    The Public Expenditure survey committee (PESC) report explains (supplementary analysis 6 at the end ofPart II) that output is already 20 per cent below the peak in 1972-73 and will fall still further; last year&apos;s expenditure cuts reduced public sector demand by  1,000 million over 1977-79;  and construction unemployment, currentlyover 200, 000, will increase by another 100, 000 by the end of 1978.    Theposition can perhaps be highlighted by the following three points -i. Unemployment amongst craftsmen is very high - 60, 000 or30 per cent of total construction unemployed.    If professional andtechnical staff in the industry, together with the self-employed andthose working in materials production, are taken into account, totalunemployed could approach 400, 000 by the end of 1978.ii. Reductions in the industry&apos;s capacity which result from thepresent very low level of demand prejudice the possibility of effective recovery.    The main sectors in building materialsproduction - bricks and cement - are now operating below 70 per centcapacity.    The supply of craftsmen for the industry will undoubtedly be affected by the very high unemployment levels in that laboursector.iii.     Both public and private housebuilding starts have been much lower than expected in the first quarter of this ye&amp;r and are nowsome 35 per cent below last year&apos;s levels.    In the latest review of1SECRET
output forecasts the Government is coming closer to the views of theNational Economic Development Office and the industry whose lessoptimistic forecasts have been nearer to the actual figures sinceoutput began to fall.3. This is against a background where houses, schools and hospitalsstill need to be built or refurbished, and new building and infrastructure isimportant to manufacturing industry.    The demand is there and the physicalresources to meet it are under-utilised.STABILITY OF DEMAND4. The industry&apos;s problems are aggravated by the instability of demandfor its services.    Though output rose over the last 20 years more or lesssteadily to the 1973 peak and has since declined continuously, demand asindicated by orders for work has fluctuated.    These demand variations aredamped down when output is measured and therefore the harm done both by pressure on scarce resources in times of peak demand and under-utilisation and low productivity in periods of decline is concealed.    Theeffect is to push up costs and reduce incentives to achieve greater productivity.    So, there could be real saving of public expenditure if largeor unexpected variations in demand were avoided.RECENT MEASURES5. I recognise and much appreciate that some action has been taken thisyear to help the industry.    In the Budget an additional  100 million wasallocated to construction work in inner cities;  and in May the effect of thefall in interest rates on the level of housing subsidies enabled us to provide an extra  30 million for public sector house improvement.    But thisamounts to only just over 10. peg,cent of the reduction we made in construe^tion programmes in 1976.NEED FOR EXTRA CONSTRUCTION EXPENDITURE6. We need to restore in a controlled way some of the drastic cuts wewere forced to make last year.    It is essential to increase expenditure on public sector construction programmes generally by a total of 400 million in 1978-79.    To achieve the right expenditure pattern andchoice of priorities this would need to be got under way shortly, but it wouldnot involve much extra expenditure in 1977-78.    This increase would do no more than help tc offset the further drop in public sector output which is currently expected in 1978.7- Allowing for remittances back to the Exchequer the net Public SectorBorrowing Requirement (PSBR) effect of initial expenditure on constructionis estimated to be only about 60 per cent.    There are also balance ofpayments considerations.    The average proportion of imports embodied in secret
instruction output is only 10 per cent;  even with the effect of earnings onconsumar demand, the final effect on imports is not more than about 25 percent.8. I recognise that the PESC Report highlights the very difficult issuesfacing us.    1978-79 is a particularly difficult year.    And the constructioncomponent of the additional bids so far made is relatively small.    I havebeen looking at my programmes to see how far I can help meet the addxtionalcosts of the construction package I have in mind.    I believe I can made a contribution.    And I am sure my colleagues would wish to consider whetherthey could help.    But the main part must come from an increase in public expenditure.    Obviously the case for this must be judged against its effects on the PSBR and also against the political impact of taking steps to sustainsome 60, 000 jobs in 1978-79 which affects the Transport and general works Union and the Union of Construction, Allied Trades andTechnicians.9. Much of the construction work would be done by local authorities andwe should recognise that this will cause problems.    Many authorities are showing a deep concern with the effect of capital expenditure on their ratebills 3nd may be reluctant to increase expenditure - this may be particularlytrue in Scotland;  and it will mean some chaoge in my position towards localauthorities in that I have been the main advocate of lestraint particularly on current expenditure.    Success in implementing my proposals could beachieved only if we consult carefully with local authorities about the package.What may be in our favour is a widespread feeling that past cuts have been too heavily concentrated on capital and a new package may somewhatredress the balance.10.        My proposals for an extra  400 million on construction work in1978-79 will help to level out demand in that year and so go some way tosecure stability in the industry.    But we must continue this increase intosubsequent years.    We also need to go further to seek to solve the stabilityproblem.    The Government must clearly retain the right to regulateprogrammes as they consider necessary.    But unless in exercising this wecan find ways of avoiding the main burden falling on the industry, no effective reassurance can be given to it.   We need to consider more closelywhether there is a practicable solution.CONCLUSIONU-        The case for action to help the industry is overwhelming and it is right to consider this in the context of the public expenditure survey.   i accordingly invite my colleagues to agree:a.      To increase public sector construction programmes by 400 million in 1978-79 (a net PSBR figure of  240 million) and tomaintain that increase in subsequent years.SECRET
b. That existing non-construction elements in programmes shouldbe reviewed with a view to increasing construction expenditure.c. To instruct officials to consider, and report on, the allocation of additional expenditure on construction between programmes and on other ways to achieve stability in construction demand.P department of the environment July 1977
