The chief secretary proposed, and the Cabinet agreed, that adecision on the 1980-81 provision should be deferred. Cmnd. 6721 accordingly stated that theProvision for 1980-81 would be determined in the fight of developments in the planned defence programme, and that &quot;at this stage therefore thefigure for 1980-81 repeats that for 1979-80 &quot;. Thebaseline figures above are derived from the Cmnd.6721 figures.2. The Ministry of Defence point out that a figureof  6,780 million for 1980-81 would have impliedbaseline figures of  6,530-3 million,  6,780-4 million and  6,780-4 million for 1979-80 and thetwo following years which exceed those in table 1by some  120 million,  240 million and  240 million respectively. They emphasise that table 1 does not represent even a provisional assessment of what is re-quired to sustain the defence programme at the levelapproved as the outcome of the Defence Review.3. Having examined their present forward plans,which have assumed that from 1979-80 onwards theDefence Budget figures would be those agreed by cabinet after the 1974 Defence Review (as amendedfor 1979-80 by Cmnd. 6393), the Ministry ofDefence consider the point has now been reachedwhere a return to the Defence Review levels isnecessary if the Defence Review programme is tobe maintained.4.   If the Defence Budget were limited to the base-line in table 1 above, the consequences for thedefence programme would  in the Ministry  ofDefence&apos;s judgment be as follows:(a) For the Navy there would have to be sub-stantial cuts in the equipment programme.This would involve a package of measuressuch as slowing down the building rate ofhunter-killer submarines and the new classof Type 22 frigates; abandoning the proposalfor a replacement class of conventional sub-marines; deferring the modernisation of olderclasses of frigates; deferring the introductionof the replacement for the Sea King anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopter untilthe 1990s; and cutting the provision for futureoffshore protection forces.  Alternatively such measures could be selected as deferring theA2
1.   Defencethird ASW cruiser to be built at SwanHunters, paying off existing frigates immedi-ately, and cutting out future shipbuildingorders at Cammell Laird. Whatever packageof measures was chosen would mean majorreductions in capability and our NATOcontribution in the critical area of ASW despite the pointed criticisms already voicedabout previous reductions by the expenditure committee as well as heavy losses of jobsand capacity in the shipbuilding industry and elsewhere. War reserves and the works pro-gramme (including operational works) wouldbe at risk, and cuts in service and civilianmanpower would almost certainly follow.(b) For the Army equipment would have to be cut.   The potential casualties include UnitedKingdom developments in air defence and anti-tank defence (precisely the areas in which theExpenditure Committee have attacked theGovernment),  and  ammunition  stocks  forwhich recent studies suggest a very sub-stantially increased requirement.   Expansionof the Ulster Defence Regiment, alreadydelayed, would be further threatened, to-gether with the additional manpower requiredto  sustain  the  present  Northern  Irelandcommand and logistic infrastructure.   Freshcuts  in civilian numbers  would  also benecessary.   Cuts in equipment and running costs would not be sufficient. Order of Battlechanges would have to be made.   Possibili-ties include the withdrawal of formations fromGermany in advance of MBFR (mutual andbalanced  force  reductions)  or,  since  that could have implications for future discussions with the Germans on offset and prejudice theTreaty commitment to a force level of 55,000,cuts in the United Kingdom&apos;s contribution tothe strategic reserve of the Supreme allied commander Europe, or a cut of a number of complete infantry battalions.   Major cuts in either of the latter would render our NorthernIreland commitment unsustainable,(c) The bulk of the cuts for the RAF would haveto be borne by the equipment programme. TheMinistry of Defence would have to consider such measures as cancelling United Kingdomdevelopment of the Harrier/Jaguar replace-ment; slowing down or reducing Tornadoproduction in its early years (with all theproblems with Germany and Italy which thiswould involve); curtailment of Nimrod refits;a cut in the Nimrod airborne early warningforce and curtailment of the electronic countermeasures   programme.     The   Ministry   ofDefence would also have to consider measures in the works area such as a 40 per cent cutover the period in the aircraft shelter pro-gramme (where lack of progress has also been criticised by the Expenditure Committee) anddeferment of improvements  in UKADGE(United   Kingdom   Air   Defence   GroundEnvironment).    Whatever   combination   of measures was selected there would be a serious loss of capability and a matching reduction inour NATO contribution.(ci) The Ministry of Defence would also have tomake substantial cuts in research and develop-ment (further affecting future front-line capa-bility); in civilian staffs (reducing the efficiency of financial control and administration); andin accommodation stores.Cuts of this size would have a substantial effect on employment. They would also run completelycounter to military logic at a time when soviet military expenditure is increasing in real terms at separately of 5 per cent a year. Whatever further reductions in our defence contribution are decided upon will have to be the subject of further consultation with NATO; if the cuts in the defence budget were to be of the nature and significancedescribed above, this would cause further serious damage to our standing in the Alliance, which hasalready suffered from the cumulative effect of fourfurther rounds of defence cuts in the two years sincethe Defence Review was completed.5. The Treasury consider there is sufficient flexi-bility in forward plans to make it technically feasiblefor the Ministry of Defence to keep to the baselinelevel which allows for growth of over 2 per cent in1979-80 and 1980-81-without acute short-termdisruption of the defence programme. Also theyconsider it unlikely that adherence to the baselinewould necessitate measures as damaging as thosesuggested by the Ministry. However they agree thatkeeping the Defence Budget to the baseline levelswould inevitably have a significant effect on our frontline capability and necessitate a reassessment of ourpresent defence commitments, with consequentdifficulties for our relations with NATO Allies.
DefenceAdditional bidso- The Ministry of Defence propose the followingchanges to the totals in table 1:  millinn				1979-80	1980-81	1981-82Defence Budget proposals . ^creases compared with the baseline in table 1  .	6,559-5 149-1	6,835-4 294-8	6,913-7 373-1The figures in the first line are the revalued defence budget figures which resulted from the defence review and were reflected in the 1975 defence white Paper (Cmnd. 5976) as approved by Ministers;they are however adjusted for 1979-80 to reflectchanges agreed in the 1975 and 1976 surveys and what is at present thought to be the likely outcome of the Anglo-German offset negotiations.    TheMinistry  of Defence  point out that althoughthe additional bids compared with the baseline arelarge the amounts sought in 1979-80 to 1981-82 are,respectively, only  29 million,  55 million and  134million greater than the baseline which would have resulted from a 1980-81 Defence Budget of  6,780million (see paragraph 2).   The additional  55million in 1980-81 is explained by the fact that,whereas it was assumed in the 1976 survey that 55 million would be forthcoming in 1980-81 for Anglo-German offset, no  such receipt is nowthought likely in that year.7-  The Ministry of Defence point out that theUnited Kingdom&apos;s present defence policy, and the critical level of capability required to fulfil it, were established and endorsed by Cabinet in the defence review. The succession of cuts made since, affect-mg the years to 1979-80, total  1,420 million andhave reduced the Defence Budget by nearly 7 percent below the Defence Review level in 1977-78and by nearly 8 per cent in 1978-79.   Becausemanpower costs are relatively inflexible in the shortterm the main burden of the cuts has fallen on the equipment, research and development, stores andApplies and works programmes.   The result has been and will be cumulative shortages of equipmentm key areas; delays in developing future equipment and bringing  it into  service;  and progressiveweakening of the Services&apos; support fabric anddecay 0f the building stock: all leading to an under-mmmg of our NATO capabilities.  The cuts havebeen strongly criticised publicly by the expenditure committee, by Parliament and by NATO. At thesame time the scale of the Forces&apos; peacekeepingcommitment in Northern Ireland has placed an increasing burden on the Defence Budget.8. In order to recover to some extent the short-term reductions in 1978-79, and in the light of the potential damage to the defence programme in later years (paragraphs 4 and 5 above), theMinistry of Defence believe that the point hasbeen reached where a return to at least the defence budget levels envisaged at the time of the defence review is necessary.9.   The Treasury accept that the baseline figures have to be interpreted in the light of the agreementbetween the Chief Secretary and the defence secretary last year that the 1980-81 figure wouldhave to be reconsidered in the present survey, whensome of the uncertainties surrounding the forwarddefence programme should have been resolved.Some uncertainties remain, e.g. over Cyprus, but even should these be resolved favourably ministers will need to consider additions to the baselinefigures if they wish to maintain our front linecapabilities   in   full,   thereby   avoiding   furtherdifficulties with NATO.   However in the Treasuryview the continuing effects, on administrative and support costs for example, of the extra economy measures adopted since the 1974 Defence Reviewhave to be taken into account.   They thereforebelieve that, although consideration may need tobe given to such factors as the increasing NorthernIreland burden, there is no longer any requirement for the Defence Budget to rise, as proposed by theMinistry, to the levels indicated in the 1975 defence white Paper.Options jor reductions10. The 1\ per cent and 5 per cent option savings would require reductions of the following amountsbelow the table 1 figures:. .   .   ...                                                                         millinn			1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82157	321	327	327legislation would not be required.11. Because adherence to the baseline figures intable 1 would in the Ministry of Defence&apos;judgment require major changes in present plans,
it has not been possible to identify detailedmeasures to achieve the option savings. As regards1978-79, the package of measures needed toproduce the cut of  267 million announced in cmnd. 6721 is still under study and has yet to bediscussed with NATO. A further reduction of 2\per cent in that year would entail still more damaging measures, which would be bound to affectthe front line and would require a further politicallydifficult approach to NATO.12.   As regards 1979-80 and subsequent years, the option cuts could not be achieved without causingfurther severe damage to our defence capability.It would be necessary for the Navy to considerpaying off existing ships already committed to NATO  and  reducing  future  force  levels  andequipment to an even greater extent than thatshown in paragraph 4 (a) above (with the graveimpact this would have on the shipbuilding industryin particular).   It would also be necessary to seekmajor   reductions   in   support   and   manpower(including   inevitable   redundancies),   despite   the potential impact on standards of training, opera-tional effectiveness and war reserves.   In short, itwould not be possible to avoid taking measuresacross the whole field of naval capability, of thesame nature but considerably more extreme thanthose described in paragraph 4 (a) above.   almost all Army equipment development and improvementprogrammes would be at risk of cancellation ordeferment.   Further cuts in equipment could onlybe  achieved  by  disrupting  projects,  many  ofthem  collaborative,  already  in  production  andcutting already inadequate ammunition stocks todangerously low levels.    Very large manpowerreductions would also be necessary, given the off-setting heavy redundancy payments that would berequired.    A review of our commitments both to NATO and in Northern Ireland would beinescapable.   For the RAF, savings of the orderrequired would lead to lasting degradation ofcapability which would involve either slicing awaya substantial part of our front line on an across-the-board basis, perhaps through disbandment of squadrons and closing of stations in RAF Germany,or abandoning an entire role.  Either would entail a further round of large-scale redundancies.  Therewould be little alternative to reviewing procure-ment policy and opting to a much greater extent forforeign off-the-shelf buys in preference to fundingnational or collaborative development, with theattendant implications for employment in theUnited Kingdom aerospace industry and exportprospects.13. The option cuts would not merely reduceplanned spending, but would mean cuts below thelevel of actual expenditure in recent years. Afurther Defence Review, leading to retrenchmenteven more severe than that set out in the 1975Defence White Paper, would be needed which would entail a complete reappraisal of the Governmenfsdefence policy and have major implications forforeign policy. While the main result of the previousReview, as far as NATO was concerned, was thereduction or elimination of United Kingdom com-commitments to the northern and southern flanks, afurther review on this scale could not be carried out without cutting into those commitments which in theDefence Review and the subsequent White paper the Government have described as those where our contribution is most significant, including theCentral Region, the maritime areas, and the securityof the United Kingdom base. At a time whenthe Warsaw Pact is making continuing rapidimprovements in its forces and all NATO countries are under pressure, reinforced by President Carter&apos;sinitiative at the NATO Summit, to provide realimprovements in their capability in order to main-tain the credibility of the Alliance deterrent posture,the impact of another Defence Review on thecohesion of the Alliance would in the Ministry ofDefence&apos;s view be incalculable. The industrial andemployment implications would also be serious; notonly would industrial job opportunities be lost ona large scale, but many servicemen and civilianstaff would face loss of their jobs. The domesticpolitical reactions would be most hostile; asevidenced by the Expenditure Committee&apos;s recentcriticism of defence cuts already announced sincethe Defence Review.14. In the view of the Ministry of Defence andof the Treasury (who would not however necessarilyendorse all the Ministry&apos;s analysis) there are nofeasible options for further savings in the defence budget within the Governmenfs current defence policy.National accounts adjustments15. This sub-programme is required to adjust theDefence Budget, in which are scored certain out-goings and receipts not properly regarded as public
expenditure or as offsets to it, to a correct statisticalbasis. Since the 1976 survey the forecast incidence of these items has changed and the followingincreases in the national accounts adjustments arisecompared with the baseline:  million1977-78     1978-79     1979-80     1980-81      1981-82  million2-72-82-52-92-8In accordance with the guidelines, it is necessaryformally to register these as additional bids. TheTreasury consider that were Ministers to agreeadditions to the Defence Budget baseline the increases in the adjustments sub-programme shouldbe absorbed without any special addition to thedefence programme.Royal ordnance factories&apos; capital expenditure16. The baseline figures are based on the Cmnd.6721 entry but include an addition in respect of aParticular investment project subsequently agreed asa claim on the contingency reserve. The Ministryof Defence now seek the following additional bidsabove the baseline to provide for further increasesm investment in line with a new forward plan:1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82+ 11-8	4-4-8	-13-6	-f6-9	-1-7-4Extra and modernised capacity is needed to meetgreater turnover, over half of which is exports, andto improve efficiency and profitability. It isintended to finance all the increases in investmentwithout, over the survey period as a whole, any increase in net borrowing from the National loans fund. (New royal ordnance factory borrowingsfrom the Fund over the period are forecast to beless than was envisaged a year ago.)17. The 2\ per cent and 5 per cent option savings,if applied to the ROF sub-programme, would imply savings of  1-3 million in 1979-80 and of 0-1 million in each of 1980-81 and 1981-82.They would have to be met by curtailing expansion(with the possible loss of overseas orders), bydeferring fixed asset replacement (with an adverse effect on efficiency and profitability) or by deferringmeasures to improve health and safety at work.Offsetting savings18. In the view of the Ministry of Defence thereare no offsetting savings available within pro-gramme 1 for any of the additional bids.

The survey figures imply a growth in the aid programme in real terms by about 5 per cent a year,or 20-5 per cent in total over the period 1977-78to 1981-82.2.  In 1974 the Government accepted in principle the United Nations target of 0-7 per cent of GNPfor official development assistance.   Although noundertakings have been given about the date of reaching this target, and it has been made clear that progress must be subject both to the pace of theUnited Kingdom&apos;s economic recovery and to theother calls on our resources, the Government has said that in the years ahead it will seek to move towards it. The United Kingdom&apos;s performance rose from 0-35 per cent in 1973 to 0-38 per cent in 1974,dropped very slightly in 1975 and returned to 0-38per cent in 1976.   Although accurate forecasts arenot possible, the figures shown in table 2 may resultin a fall in our performance in 1977 and 1978 andin only a very slight improvement on our 1976performance by the end of the survey period.3. During the survey period the calls on the aid programme are likely to increase because of anumber of factors including the outcome of theConference on International Economic Co-operation,the possibility of costs to the aid programme arisingout of the establishment of a Common Fund, andthe implications of a settlement in Rhodesia.4. No new legislation would be required to change the level of expenditure on overseas aid, which is within the Governments administrative control.But in order to plan and spend the aid programme to the best possible effect it is often necessary toenter into commitments at least two years ahead.This means that there is only limited room for manoeuvre in 1977-78 and 1978-79 in view of the reductions already made for those years.New developments5. There is increasing pressure from the develop-ing countries for more aid and a new accommoda-tion between donors and recipients. The UnitedKingdom will need to be able to play its part inthis process. Yet the survey figures provide littlescope for new commitments or new initiativesbefore 1980-81. It is not possible to forecastaccurately the additional demands which might arise from the factors summarised in paragraph 3
but the Ministry of Overseas Development estimate the additional funds required to meet disbursementson new developments are as follows:  million1979-80 1980-81 1981-8246 30 30The Treasury take the view that these costs, if they arise, can, without departing from existing policy,be accommodated within the survey totals, whichimply an average annual growth in real terms ofsome  32 million a year.Options for reductions6. The effect of reductions of 2\ per cent in1978-79 and 5 per cent in 1979-80 to 1981-82would be savings as follows:  million1978-79   1979-80   1980-81   1981-82Aid programme (net)      16-5       35-3       37-6       37-6Reductions of this order could involve some cutting-back on existing commitments in 1978-79 but notin 1979-80. The Treasury point out that on the survey figures the growth of the programme is roughly 2\ times as great as that implied by the survey figures for public expenditure as a whole.They believe that neither these reductions nor the much larger savings which could be achieved if theannual average real growth planned for the aid programme were reduced from 5 per cent to say2 per cent need mean a departure from the agreedaid strategy. The Ministry of Overseas Develop-ment consider that the 2\ per cent and 5 per centreductions would make it impossible to maintain an unallocated margin adequate for the type ofcontingencies referred to in paragraphs 3 and 5above and at the same time continue to implement the agreed aid strategy. They would entail reducingPlanning allocations to individual countries and international institutions to an extent which theMinistry of Overseas Development would regard as unacceptable. The Ministry also believe thatthe much larger reductions implied by a 2 per centgrowth rate would require correspondingly greaterreductions in planning allocations and would resultin a totally inadequate contingency margin. Anyreductions would mean that there would be a greaterprobability that the United Kingdom performanceagainst the 0-7 per cent target would decline.Reductions of either of these magnitudes would be unlikely to lead to savings in administrative costs.Overseas aid administrationAdditional bid7. The Ministry of Overseas Development require an additional  0-1 million in 1979-80 and  0-5 million in 1980-81 for dispersal to East Kilbride.Review of overseas representation8. The four programmes dealt with in paragraphs9 to 24 below, either in whole or, in the case ofother external relations, in part, are the responsi-bility of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office(FCO). The policies underlying this expenditurehave recently been the subject of the Review of overseas Representation announced on 14 January,1976, the report of which is still being consideredby Ministers. At this stage, therefore, illustrativecuts of 21- per cent in 1978-79 and 5 per cent in later years are shown on a strictly pro rata basis for each sub-programme or element thereof.Overseas representationImplications of survey figures9. This expenditure includes the cost of the FCOin London, representation abroad and officialdelegations to international organisations and conferences. It also includes the cost of the passport offices, the communications organisationsupporting the Diplomatic Service and expenditure by the Property Services Agency (PSA) on the diplomatic estate. After an initial reductionbetween the first and second years of the survey period, forecast expenditure on this programme, withthe exception of that relating to the diplomaticestate, remains level throughout the period.10. In the case of the diplomatic estate, theprovision for 1978-79 reflects the hiatus in thebuildings acquisition programme resulting from theexpenditure cuts and uncertainties of the last threeyears. The higher level of provision in the later years of the survey period will, broadly speaking,allow the programme to resume its planned course.SECRET
11. The Treasury note that a reduction in the survey figures for the diplomatic estate has beenaccepted, but takes the view that further reductions could be made as follows:  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-822-9	5-4	5-4	5-4This is on the basis of what is likely realisticallyto be spent on the capital programme and the associated maintenance.12. There are also a number of small additionalbids for new developments rising to  1-9 million by 1981-82.Options for reductions13. On a pro rat a basis for the two main elementswithin this sub-programme, cuts in planned expen-diture of 2\ per cent in 1978-79 and 5 per cent in later years would be:  million	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82Diplomatic service, etc.	3-0	6-1	6-1	6-1Diplomatic estate	0-8	1-9	1-9	20Total  .	3-8	80	80	8-114. Options of this magnitude would be likelyto involve restrictions in the conduct of business with foreign governments and international organisations, as well as cuts in consular, passportand export promotion services leading possibly tosome post closures and staff redundancies. Whereand how such reductions might best be made is amatter for judgement. Any decisions would haveto be taken by Ministers in the light of the Reviewof Overseas Representation.15. Such cuts would also lead to a further slow-down in the ten-year acquisition programme for the diplomatic estate announced in 1971.Overseas informationImplications of survey figures16. This programme covers expenditure by theBritish Council (other than overseas aid); theBBCs External Services; FCO information staff at home and abroad; and supporting services of theCentral Office of Information (COI) and the stationery Office.   After a fall between 1977-78and 1978-79, forecast expenditure on the sub-programme is level throughout the survey period.Options for reductions17. Cuts in planned expenditure of 2\ per centin 1978-79 and 5 per cent in the following years,applied on a pro rata basis to each element within this programme would be:  million	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82FCO information staff	0-2	0-4	0-4	0-4FCO operational ex-				penditure	01	0-2	0-2	0-2BBC external services	0-8	1-5	1-5	1-british Council (FCO				share)   -	0-5	11	11	1-1COI/HMSO	0-2	0-4	0-4	0-4Total  .	1-8	3-6	3-6	3-618. As in the case of overseas representation,Ministerial decisions in the light of the Review of overseas Representation would be crucial in determining the effects of such reductions. Cuts ofthis order could not be made by general pruningbut might involve:(a) in external broadcasting, a significant re-duction in vernacular broadcasting and areduction in the effective operation of bothBBC and FCO relay stations carrying the external services;(b) in the case of the British Council grant in aid, withdrawal from some countries and major reductions in others, the indefinite post-ponement of planned expansion in certain countries and the reduction in headquartersservices;(c) reduction across a wide range of servicessupported by the COI and Stationery office in support of the information activities of diplomatic Service posts abroad.Other external relationsImplications of survey figures19. The main items of expenditure are: theUnited Kingdom&apos;s assessed contributions to inter-national organisations such as the United nations and NATO; other payments to meet Her Majesty&apos;governments other international commitments;provision for the United Nations Force in Cyprus;and the grant in aid to the Commonwealth war graves Commission.

The above sums are sought for the con-continuation of support to the United NationsEmergency Force in the Middle East which is likelyto remain in being for the foreseeable future.Savings of this magnitude could be found withinthe other external relations programme only bywithdrawal from one or more of the majorinternational organisations such as the Council ofEurope, OECD or NATO. Savings on FCOprogrammes as a whole are covered in paragraph of this section. There is also a small additionalbid not exceeding  1 million in any one year.Options for reductions21. Cuts of 2\ per cent in 1978-79 and 5 per centin each of the following years would amount to:  million	1978	1979	1980	1981	-79	-80	-81	-82Commonwealth War Graves				Commission .	0 1	0-3	0-3	0-other	0-8	1-6	1-6	1-622. The Commonwealth War Graves commission has already undertaken to make a further reductionin its staff by 25 (to 1,437) in 1977-78, followingreductions of 25 in 1976-77 and 250 during earlier years as a result of reorganisation from the thentotal of 1,687. The provision of  5-3 million in1977-78 reflects a saving of over  0-1 million.The savings shown in the table above could onlybe achieved by further staff reductions of about 35in 1978-79 (to 1,402) and another 35 in 1979-80(to 1,367) which would drastically affect theCommission^ power to carry out its duties.23. Since international obligations rule out uni-lateral reductions in United Kingdom subscriptionsto international organisations, savings of the aboveorder could entail: drastically reducing oreliminating the grant to the CommonwealthInstitute; reducing or eliminating other smallergrants in aid; severely restricting the use for foreignvisitors of VIP facilities at airports.SECRETMilitary aid24. This programme consists mainly of courses in the United Kingdom for overseas service personnel and to a lesser extent the loan of british service personnel to a few developing countries fortraining purposes. Programmed expenditure islevel throughout the review period. There is asmall additional bid in the years 1978-79 to1980-81.Contribution to the European Communities, etc.(net)25. This comprises United Kingdom contributions to the European Communities&apos; budget (excludingamounts attributed to aid and other programmes);capital contributions to the European InvestmentBank (following agreement, in July 1975, to increase its capital); and receipts by the United kingdom from the Communities&apos; budget. Conversions fromunit of account into sterling have been made at thepresent unit of account rate of 2-4 units of account to the  .26. In accordance with the guidelines approved by ministers the figures in the base line are thoseincluded in Cmnd. 6721. The figures for 1981-82have been entered at the 1980-81 level. They havebeen built up by applying the forecast UnitedKingdom percentage share of the Communities&apos;budget in each year to estimates of the cost ofcarrying out existing Community policies. these estimates take account of modifications which areexpected to occur in those policies. The UnitedKingdom&apos;s share of the budget is fixed at 19-24per cent in 1977 and will increase progressively inthe following two years as the United Kingdommoves to the full own resources system in 1980.Additional bids27. There is a possibility that a change in the unit of account from 1 January 1978 could lead to anincreased contribution to the Communities&apos; budgetby the United Kingdom. Also the way in whichown resources are made available to the Communitywill change from 1 January 1978, following theintroduction of the full own resources system.From that date member states will no longer con-tribute to the Community Budget on the basis of pre-determined relative shares but will pay over allagricultural levies and customs duties, plus VAT11b2
own resources (or if they have not been introduced a financial contribution based on GNP shares) threemonths after establishment. The Commissionconsider that, to give effect to this change, the cashflows in respect of the 1978 and earlier budgets mustbe kept completely separate; depending on the waythis change is put into effect, an additional contri-bution by the United Kingdom may be requiredto finance cash flow needs:  million	1977	1978	1979	1980	1981	-78	-79	-80	-81	-82Change in unit of account	_	500	 	 	 Cash flow needs	150-0	 	 	 	 Total	. 1500	50-0	-	-	-Possible savings28.

Expenditure inNorthern Ireland on price guarantees for sheepaQd potatoes, on production and capital supportmeasures, and on support in special areas isdeluded in programme 15.2- The Governmenfs objectives and priorities for agriculture remain as set out in the 1975 white paper &quot;Food from our Own Resources&quot; (Cmnd.6020). Virtually all IBAP&apos;s expenditure is manda-tory, implementing the system of market regulationunder the eec&apos;s common agricultural policy (CAP)and the eec&apos;s food aid programme. The main items are: the purchase of stocks into intervention;aids for storage; and the payment of &quot; monetarycompensatory amounts&quot; (MCAs) on certainimports from third countries, mainly sugar. Mostof the expenditure is funded by advances from the eec. Some of the expenditure on agricultural sup-port by MAFF and DAFS is similarly obligatoryunder e.c. regulations; the remainder implementsnational decisions, taken in the light of the annualagricultural reviews.
ADDITIONAL OR REDUCED REQUIRE-MENTS FOR THE MAINTENANCE OFEXISTING policy. The figures below are based on the latest fore-casts. However, expenditure on market regulation and some other forms of agricultural supportdepends considerably upon agricultural yieldsand the level of world market prices, so fore-casts for these items are subject to a widemargin of error. Main assumptions underlying the forecasts are mentioned below.Market regulation under the CAP4. No change has been assumed in the &quot; green &quot; at which e.c. prices and rates of subsidyetc. are converted from units of account intosterling; and no change in the relationshipexisting in early May 1977 between sterling andthe currencies in the &quot; snake&quot;. These two factors determine the percentage (32-3 per cent atthat date) from which the MCAs are calculated.Without prejudice to future policy decisionsit has been assumed that United Kingdom beef production will continue to be supported duringthe survey period by the payment of &quot; premiums &quot;to producers as well as by intervention. for years after 1977-78, equality has been assumed in the quantities purchased into and sold fromintervention.Price guarantees5. With the ending of the five-year transitionto the full CAP system, price guarantees can continue only for wool, which is outside the scopeof the CAP, and for sheep and potatoes, for whichCAP regimes have not yet been agreed. Forecastsmore than one year ahead are not very meaningfuland, following previous conventions, a constant levelof expenditure has been assumed, consisting of relatively small provisions for sheep and potatoes.Expenditure on potatoes is particularly uncertainbecause yields, and therefore market prices, canfluctuate widely.Production grants and subsidies and support in special areas6. The forecasts take account of the loss of value, due to inflation, of grants and subsidiesat fixed cash rates. The figures for 1978-79and later years reflect the decision to end thecalf subsidy for calves born after April 1977.Other assistance to agricultural production, foodprocessing and marketing; and central and miscellaneous services. The forecasts include continuing expenditure by MAFF and DAFS on research and develop-ment, advisory services and the eradication andcontrol of animal disease. Expenditure onanimal diseases is forecast to fall as theeradication of brucellosis nears completion.Fisheries support8. As a result of last year&apos;s decisions on public expenditure the figures provide for a continu-ation of grants and loans for new vessels andequipment at the exceptionally low level ofexpenditure in 1976-77. No provision has beenmade for any measures of restructuring requiredin the light of changes in access to fishingwaters.9. These and other assumptions result in thefollowing increased or reduced requirements:(i) Mandatory expenditure under e.c. regulationsIBAP&apos;s additional requirement, taking accountof decisions at the CAP price-fixing in April1977, is estimated at:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80     1980-81	1981-82-	18-9	20-5          20-5	20-5Of these	amounts,	about  18 million	in eachyear is funded by payments from the e.c. whichserve to reduce the United Kingdom&apos;s net contribution to the e.c. (programme 2) corres-correspondingly. The forecasts include receipts of 10 million in 1977-78 and  20 million in later years arising from the introduction of a levy on milk producers from September 1977. The deci-sions at the CAP price-fixing result in the following additional requirements by MAFF and DAFS, dueprincipally to new e.c. measures to encouragefarmers out of milk production:  million1977-   1978-   1979-   1980-   1981-78       79       80       81       82milk measures - -0-2 5-8 5-7 1-4 3-other measures 0-5     0-5     0-4     0-4     0-
Most of this expenditure, together with thecorresponding expenditure in Northern Ireland(see programme 15, paragraph 4), is similarlyfunded by the e.c. and, in addition, total EECexpenditure on agricultural support will be lowerdue to the reduction in milk production broughtabout by these measures. These two factorstogether are estimated to reduce the UnitedKingdom&apos;s net contribution to the e.c. (pro-gramme 2), compared with what it would other-wise have been, by the following amounts:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-8218-3	59-8	68-8	66-4	64-4---.-				These reductions can therefore be regarded asoffsetting the additional requirements.(ii) Other expenditure the following reduced requirements are forecastby MAFF and DAFS and the correspondingreductions for Northern Ireland (see programme15, paragraph 6) are added to produce a figure for the United Kingdom as a whole:__                                                                 million						1977 -78	1978 -79	1979 -80	1980 -81	1981 -82-Maff   . dafs     .	-11-7 -4-5	-11-2 -0-3	-0-6	-1-6 +0-7	_Northern Ireland	-0-1	-1-6	-2-1	-2-9	-Total   .	-16-3	-131	-2-7	-3-8	PROPOSALS FOR NEW DEVELOPMENTSjo. As part of the 1977-78 reductionsannounced in July 1976, the payment of capital grants under national grant schemes was deferredby three months. The reduced requirementsshown above are mainly due to lower uptake ofCapital grants and the agricultural departmentsPropose that they should revert to normalPayment procedures during the last quarter of1977 -78. It is also proposed to revert to thenormal timing of payments of allowances underthe e.c. directive on Less Favoured Areas. Theadditional expenditure under both proposals isas follows:  million1977 1978 1979 1980 1981-78       -79       -80       -81       -82maff anddafs 15-1 5-7       2-2Northern Ireland(programme 15) 1-2 0-6       0-5                 16-3       6-3       2-7       -        -and could therefore, on an United Kingdom basis,be met from the savings shown above.OPTIONS FOR REDUCTIONS11. The illustrative options required by theground rules are shown below and the impli-cations are described in the following paragraphs.However, the scope for significant reductions inthis part of the programme is now very limited.Much of the expenditure implements the CAPand is therefore governed by e.c. directivesand regulations; most of it, including virtually all expenditure on market regulation, cannotbe unilaterally adjusted by the United Kingdom.Savings in staff and administration were madelast year and substantial further savings couldnot be achieved without abolishing functions.12.   Given   the	mandatory	nature	of	IBAP&apos;expenditure,  no	reductions	are  feasible		the options   for  reductions  in		MAFF	and	DAFSexpenditure are:								  million	1978	1979	1980	1981	-79	-80	-81	-82(a) Research .	.    0-5	0-8	1-4	20(b) Fisheries  grants	and			loans	.    0-7	0-7	0-7	0-7(c) Reductions in agricul-				tural support	8-2	16-7	160	15-1Total ( = savings requiredby guidelines inmaff and dafs ex-penditure) .      .      .9-4     18-2     18-1      17-8Research13. Cmnd. 6721 reflected some postponement of  expansion  in  expenditure  on  research  and
development and the savings illustrated aboveassume no growth at all after 1977-78. TheWhite Paper &quot;Food from our Own Resources&quot;(Cmnd. 6020) pointed out however that the rapid growth in agricultural productivity hadbeen materially helped by the application of research findings and that there was need for a continuing investment in the scientific improve-ment of agricultural technology. The savings would be likely to hinder the realisation ofpotentially higher output, by curtailing the amountof new work commissioned.Fishery grants and loans14. The agricultural departments consider that further reductions in the availability of grants and loans would have adverse effects on the agestructure of the fleet, on modernisation plans tomeet new safety regulations, and on theGovernment^ negotiating position for the accessof United Kingdom fishing vessels to Communitywaters and to the waters of third countries.The effect of a reduction in loans only wouldbe similar though less severe.Reductions in agricultural support15. To provide the total illustrative savingsrequired by the ground rules, reductions wouldhave to be considered in the capital grants,guidance premiums or allowances paid in lessfavoured areas (LFAs). All the reductions would necessitate the amendment of the appropriateStatutory Instrument, which requires affirmative resolutions. It has not previously been thepractice to alter support levels except in thelight of the statutory annual reviews of theeconomic condition and prospects of the industry.DAFs consider (see paragraph 18) that thereduction in LFA allowances is not a feasibleoption.Capital grants16. The basic grant rates under the capitalgrant schemes for agriculture, horticulture andco-operation have never been lower than atpresent. The volume of capital investment has fallen over the last two years and is less thanneeded to achieve the expansion indicated inthe White Paper &quot; Food from our own resources &quot; (Cmnd. 6020). Any further reductionin  grants  would  be  likely  to  result  in  stilllower capital investment. The higher rates of grant payable for field drainage, and thoseintroduced as recently as 1976 for cattlebuildings, grass silos and certain other types of investment, are intended to give special encourage-ment where it will be of most benefit to theexpansion of economic production, eg. by encouraging the better use and conservation ofgrass and economic milk production. Unlessany reduction were applied to all schemes, i.e.including the e.c. farm and horticulturedevelopment scheme (FHDS), some farmers andhorticulturists would switch their investment plansfrom the national schemes to the FHDS whichhas preferential rates of grant, and this mightprevent the achievement of the required saving.Reduced FHDS rates would entail a correspond-ing reduction in the 25 per cent contribution from the e.c..Guidance premiums17. These are payable to farmers whose develop-ment plans under the FHDS are concentrated on cattle and sheep for meat production and therates are prescribed in an e.c. directive. TheUnited Kingdom has already proposed in Brusselsthat these should be maxima and not fixedamounts. If this proposal is accepted, therates applicable in the United Kingdom couldbe reduced. There would be a corresponding reduction in the 25 per cent contribution fromthe e.c..LFA allowances18. The e.c. directive on LFAs provides for thepayment of compensatory allowances on cattle and sheep. The rates are set nationally within pre-scribed maxima. In 1975-76 these allowancescontributed about one-third of hill farm income.The rates are set in cash terms and the surveyfigures imply that their real value is allowed to beeroded as prices rise. The level of assistance tohill and upland farmers is a sensitive area and areduction, which would not be feasible before thebeginning of 1979, would be controversial par-ticularly as the income of these farmers will beaffected by the ending of the calf subsidy. The25 per cent contribution from the e.c. would bereduced proportionately. DAFS consider that areduction in LFA allowances is not a feasibleoption as decisions on the allowances must have
regard to the economic condition and prospects ofthe LFAs and there is no certainty that a reduction would be compatible with the Government^objectives for these areas.Conclusions on options19. If the reductions referred to at (c) of the table in paragraph 12 were met wholly from capital grants, one way of achieving this would be toreduce most rates of grant by about five percentagepoints. However the agricultural departmentsconsider that this would have harmful effects on necessary investment throughout the UnitedKingdom; and that other options, namely reductions in the guidance premiums or LFA allowances,would be more damaging to agricultural incomes inthe major livestock rearing areas of Wales and scotland. Any of these proposals would have to bereferred to Brussels. The procedure for consul-tation would probably take some months and, asnoted above, a reduction in the guidance premiumswould require a change in e.c. directives.20. The agricultural departments consider thatimplementation of these options would be regarded by farmers and growers as evidence that theGovernment had abandoned the policies set outin the White Paper &quot; Food from our own resources &quot;, and that their resulting loss of con-fidence would seriously reduce the chances ofsecuring savings in our food imports. Theysimilarly consider that further reductions in the grants and loans for fishermen would put at risk the maintenance of our fishing catch.Additional Treasury option21. The Treasury suggest that consideration shouldbe given to the sale of agricultural land held by theSecretary of State for Scotland for Land SettlementPurposes, particularly in the light of any commentswhich may be made by the Public accounts committee.food subsidies22. The 1977-78 survey figure has been increasedby  67 1 million to meet expenditure by IBAP onthe new e.c. butter subsidy, for the period 1 May1977 to 31 March 1978, agreed in the 1977 CAPnegotiations. About three-quarters of the cost ofthis subsidy will be met from e.c. funds. Thebalance of the 1977-78 provision ( 43-4 million)reflects the phasing out of the United Kingdomfood subsidies programme in mid-1977.   No pro-vision is made for the cost of the e.c. buttersubsidy in the period 1 April to 31 December 1978,for which no subsidy rate has yet been fixed. Theexisting token of  2-3 million for 1978-79 has beenrounded up to  3-0 million as the amount requiredfor spill-over payments by IBAP for the known(1977-78) subsidy. Given the policy decision to end the United Kingdom subsidy programme during 1977, and the difficulty of forecasting realis-tically any expenditure on future e.c. subsidies,no useful purpose is served by retaining any pro-vision beyond 1978-79, and the token provisionby Department of Prices and Consumer Protectionof  2 - 3 million for each of these years has therefore been withdrawn.FORESTRY23. This item covers the Forestry Commission^activities in promoting the interests of forestry, theestablishment and maintenance of adequate reserves of growing trees and the production and supply of timber. The activities divide between the ForestryEnterprise (a Government trading service) and the forestry Authority. The expenditure figures corn-prise mainly the current expenditure of the ForestryAuthority (including the grants it makes to theprivate sector), the capital expenditure of the forestry Enterprise, and a subsidy to the ForestryEnterprise representing the difference between itstarget rate of return of 3 per cent set by theGovernment and a notional cost of capital employed measured by the ruling governmentlending rate. There are other subsidies onactivities which are not capable of producing the target rate but which are undertaken for socialreasons.24. The planting programme of the ForestryEnterprise set in 1972, and endorsed by ministers in 1973 and 1974, was 22,000 hectares per year,including about 18,000 hectares of new planting.Over the survey period the forest estate is planned to increase from about 840,000 hectares to 920,000hectares with a plantable reserve reducing to about85,000 hectares. Approximately 600 kilometres ofnew roads will be constructed and about 11 million cubic metres of timber harvested. Further recreational-tional facilities will be provided including campingsites and self catering accommodation, informationcentres, picnic places and viewpoints with asso-ciated parking facilities, forest walks and naturetrails.secret17
25. As the Forestry Authority, the Commissionundertakes research into all branches of forestry,controls felling in private woodlands and providestechnical advice to private woodland owners.The Commission pays grants for planting timber-producing species subject to the acceptance by theowner of obligations relating to the management of the woodlands designed to secure sound forestrypractice, good land use, environmental benefits and opportunities for recreation. Increases in thesegrants were announced on 30 March 1977 in thelight of the inter-departmental review of forestrytaxation and grants. These will raise the annuallevel of expenditure by some  1-8 million by1980-81.ADDITIONAL   REQUIREMENTS   FOR   THEMAINTENANCE OF EXISTING POLICIES26. Additional provision of  2-7 million isrequired for 1981-82 as follows:(i) Remission of interest. In accordance with paragraph 5 of the guidelines the surveyfigures for 1981-82 are the same as for1980-81. However, the remission of interest is calculated on the total value of the invest-ment, which includes the value added tothe plantations through expenditure on maintenance and protection and thus auto-matically increases each year. consequently the provision for remission of interest has tobe increased by  2-4 million for 1981-82compared with 1980-81.(ii) Increase in value of stocks. This provisionincludes interest at 3 per cent which similarlyincreases annually with the continuinginvestment in plantations. Additional pro-vision of  0-3 million is required for 1981-82compared with 1980-81, representing addi-tional interest ( 0-6 million) less the increasein the value of timber to be harvested inthat year ( 0 - 3 million).This additional provision for 1981-82 does not represent cash expenditure. To offset it wouldrequire a cut of 9 per cent in cash expenditure,which would involve a big reduction in capital investment in that year, including land purchases.The Commission consider that this would affectthe future planting and marketing programmes toa quite unacceptable degree.OPTIONS FOR REDUCTIONS27. The present survey figures, including the cutsmade after the 1976 survey, themselves involvereducing the previously approved annual planting programme of 22,000 hectares (see paragraph 24above) by some 2,000 hectares in 1977-78 and1978-79 and 3,000 hectares per year thereafter, i.e.some 9-14 per cent. Expenditure on forest manage-ment and recreation projects was also cut. Anyfurther cuts in expenditure would have to fallmainly on the planting programme. The Commis-sion consider this would be paradoxical at a timewhen private sector planting is being encouraged by the increased grants referred to above.28. Since some 60 per cent of the total forestryfigures relates to remission of interest, a reductionof these figures by 2\ and 5 per cent would involvecuts of up to 13 per cent in cash expenditure.Accordingly, as in the 1976 survey, the reductionshave been calculated on the cash expenditureelement only. The sums involved and their implications are set out below:  million1978 1979 1980 1981-79       -80       -81       -82Survey figures	72	5	75	1	78	5	78	5Less interest	37	2	40	1	43	0	43	0 planting subsidy   .	3	3	3	3	3	3	3	3Cash expenditure   .	32	0	31	7	32	2	32	2Options for reductions	0	8	1	6	1	6	1	6Activity implications								Planting and labour on-								cost                       -	0	2	0	7	0	7	0	8Land acquisition			0	3	0	2	0	3Administrative staffing and								costs ....					0	1	0	1Machinery and equipment	0	5	0	5	0	5	0	3Commercial recreation	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	0	8	1	6	1	6	1	629. If these cuts were made, the planting pro-gramme would have to be further reduced by 1,000hectares in 1978-79, 4,000 hectares in 1979-80 and1980-81 and 4,500 hectares in 1981-82. Added tothe previous cuts, this would mean a reduction ofsome 34 per cent in the original programme of22,000 hectares per year by the end of the survey period.   Some 30 industrial jobs would be lost in
1978-79 rising to 135 in 1981-82, which wouldinvolve redundancies. Land acquisition would be cut correspondingly. On the administrative side, afurther 20 posts would be lost by 1980, probablyinvolving redundancies. The cuts in machinery and equipment would involve delays in replacementand the modernisation of harvesting machinery; thiswould be likely to reduce efficiency and endanger the achievement of the increasing harvesting pro-gramme. The reductions in expenditure onrecreational facilities would entail suspendingcampsite construction entirely in 1978-79, and a reduced programme of campsite and forest cabindevelopment thereafter.19

Against these, the department have shown off-setting savings as follows (the order does notindicate the priority):  million1977 1978 1979 1980 1981-78    -79    -80    -81    -82Section 8 of the industry act, 1972.

These are discussed below but the reductionsdisplayed are, except in 1977-78, sufficient to offsetall the additional bids for existing policies and new developments. The proposed savings on research and development expenditure exactly match theproposed increases in expenditure on the spaceprogrammes.10. There is an additional requirement in 1977-78of  37 - 2 million but against this the department areunable to offer any offsetting savings beyond the 21-9 million shown. All programmes have been closely appraised and substantial reductions havealready been made in a number of instances. a major element in the increased requirement is a lateand substantial estimating change in the provisionfor refinancing of home shipbuilding lendingamounting to  27 million.Options for reductions11. In addition to offsetting savings, the depart-ment are required to identify option cuts as follows:  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-8226-9	47-3	45-3	44-212. It would be possible to meet these option cutsonly by resorting to further reductions in the rateof regional development grants (RDG): a cut of theorder of two percentage points would be needed.This cut, together with the two percentage pointscut already proposed, would reduce the rate of regional development grants by nearly a quarteroverall.13. By far the greater part of the expenditure ofthe department is accounted for by responsiveprogrammes, industrial support schemes for whichspecific sums have been announced, commitments to individual companies and the provision for theNational Enterprise Board. The total resources available to the department for the governments policies of regional development and the regenera-tion of industry under the industrial strategyalready decline in total over the period of the survey. The department consider that to berequired to find the offsetting savings and to meetthe option cuts required under the survey wouldbe very damaging to both these closely linkedpolicies. It would, therefore, in the departmentsview be entirely inconsistent with the general policyof giving greater priority in the Government spend-ing programmes to industrial strategy and to regional support, if savings were required or cutsimposed. Indeed the proposed expenditure on thenew subprogramme &quot; future industrial support&quot;is designed to offset, although only in part, thedecline over the survey period in the resources available. Any reduction of these resources would call in question the validity of the policies
designed to assist industry and regional develop-ment. If the offsetting savings and the savings tomeet possible option cuts were implemented therewould be significant consequences.14.  The reduction in the funds provided to british leyland under section 8 of the Industry Act, 1972would inevitably pre-empt more of the resources available to the National Enterprise Board, therebycircumscribing the Board&apos;s other industrial activitiesnotwithstanding the increases proposed  for theBoard in later years of the survey.   The savings from assisted area boundary changes would mainlyaccrue to the RDG sub-programme although therewould be marginal savings on regional selectiveassistance both for the department and the scottish and Welsh Offices.   Reductions in the rate of regional development grant may appear to be easychanges to make.  Industry does, however, set greatstore by stability in the Governments investment incentives and has been highly critical of thefluctuations in policies in the past.  Inward invest-ment could also be adversely affected by reductions on the scale which would be required to meet theoffsetting savings and option cuts.  Such reductions would have to be announced with adequate notice and this could harm investment prospects.15. Nor would these changes offer any savings in administrative costs or manpower. The cutsproposed are technically feasible, although no attempt has been made to assess their politicalpracticality. However, for the reasons advancedthe department do not believe that these or anyother cuts to its programme are acceptable.REGIONAL SUPPORT AND REGENERATIONRegional development grants16. Regional development grants under Part Iof the Industry Act, 1972 are made towards the costof buildings and plant and machinery to be usedm qualifying activities at the rate of 22 per cent inthe special development areas and 20 per cent in development areas. Grants are also made at 20 percent towards the cost of buildings in the inter-mediate areas.

The forecasts are based on the assumptionthat the rates of grant and the present extent of the assisted areas will remain unchanged and that therewill be no further changes in the industrial sectorscovered by the scheme beyond those announced inJuly 1976 (i.e. the exclusion of SIC Order II(Mining) and SIC Order XX (Construction) fromthe scheme from 1 April 1977 and a three months&apos;administrative deferment of all approved payments on applications received on or after 1 April 1977).18. The proposals are the departments best estimate of the provision required based onassumptions about the rate and scale of investment and as such could be subject to a wide margin of error. But this is essentially a responsive programme and the department consider that there is no obligation on their part to offer offsetting savingsfor anticipated increases over the survey period. Inthe last year of the survey the figures include an assumption of 3 per cent a year long-term growth.Additional bid to meet existing policies  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82-	30	10	6 0	19-0Provision of land and buildings19. It is assumed that the present policy of landacquisition and of announcing regular advancefactory programmes will continue, that the criteriagoverning the provision of new factories or exten-sions will remain unchanged and that the policy of seeking sales of factories will continue. It is alsoassumed that two-year rent-free periods willcontinue to be granted to most new tenants.20. The deferral from 1977-78 to 1978-79 ofpart of the programme of factory building in ship-building areas is reflected in the proposed increasein 1978-79. Decreases in net revenues result fromhigher administrative and maintenance costs andfrom revised assumptions about the phasing ofbuilding programmes affecting the rate at whichfactories are let. In the last two years of the survey the proposed increases reflect a widening ofthe subsidy element on &quot;notional rents &quot;, not offset by rental revenues.Maintenance of existing policies  million1978-791979-801980-811981-825-84-02-74-4
Selective assistance to industry in assisted areas21. Assistance under section 7 of the Industry Act,1972 is available on a selective basis for industrialprojects which provide or maintain employment inthe assisted areas. It is additional to other non-selective regional incentives such as regional development grants, for which projects may qualify.Assistance may be given in a number of forms, themost usual being loans or grants for new expenditure.22. It is assumed that section 7 of the Industry Act,1972 will continue to be the main instrument of selective financial assistance for employmentcreation and maintenance in the assisted areas. the forecasts are based on continuation of the presentcriteria. No provision is made for new &quot; rescuecases &quot; and any excess expenditure on this accountmay have to be considered as a claim on the contingency reserve.23. Expenditure in England is forecast to decreasesignificantly, roughly by one-third, as a once andfor all result of revised forecasting assumptions used by the Department of Industry.24. The Scottish and Welsh Offices have not adopted the new assumptions. The Welsh Officeforecast no change compared with Cmnd. 6721.The Scottish Office have an additional bid of 1-2 million for 1978-79, 1979-80 and 1980-81and  1-3 million for 1981-82 as a result of a lower forecast of revenue than previously expected.25. In the opinion of the Treasury, the scottish office should accommodate the forecast shortfall in revenue from within their existing provision.The Treasury also take the view that the scottish and Welsh forecasts could be reduced by using theEnglish assumptions. Actual levels of expenditure under this sub-programme are however largelydemand-determined.Maintenance of existing policies  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82-12-9	-12-6	-12-6	-12-5Assistance for publicity26. Grants are made to the North of EnglandDevelopment Council, the North West IndustrialDevelopment Association and the Yorkshire andHumberside Development Association towardsexpenditure on publicity to promote development.Grants have been approved for the three years ending 1979-80.Regional employment premium27. Provision is made in 1977-78 to meet residualclaims.Residual expenditure under repealed sections of theLocal Employment Act, 197228. Outstanding commitments to pay buildinggrants and grants under section 4 of the Act areexpected to be met by 1980. Estimated expenditureon grants during the survey period is broadly in line with the Cmnd. 6721 provision, although buildinggrant expenditure in England is expected to be lessas a result of fewer claims. In 1981-82 Depart-ment of Industry have a reduced requirement of 0-5 million and the Scottish Office an additionalbid of  1-5 million. The Welsh component is consistent with Cmnd. 6721. The overall figures are as follows:Maintenance of existing policies  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82-0-1	-0-7	-1-7	-1-1-0INDUSTRIAL INNOVATIONIndustrial research establishments and ComputerAided Design Centre29. This programme covers the net running costs of the industrial research establishments (IREs)including for the first time as an autonomous bodythe National Maritime Institute; and the ComputerAided Design Centre. Also included for the first time is provision for the British Calibration Servicetransferred from the Department of Prices and consumer Protection.30. Activities at the IREs are maintained at broadly the present level over the survey period to permitincreased support to be given to industry through
R&amp;D contracts. Inter alia, this has resulted in areduction in expenditure on capital items duringthe forecast years. Provision of  1 -3 million for the replacement of the National Physical Laboratory&apos;scomputer is made in 1979-80, and for the relocationof the Laboratory of the Government Chemist toCumbria in 1980-81 ( 2 0 million) and 1981-82( 2-5 million).Research and development contracts31. Research and development contracts, mainly on a cost-sharing basis, will be increasingly placed with industry and the industrial research associa-tions, and will take into account the objectivesidentified in the sector working party reports of theNational Economic Development CounciFs industrialstrategy exercise. Expenditure on these is expectedto grow by 40 per cent over the survey period withthe aim of improving the performance and com-Petitiveness of United Kingdom industry bystrengthening its technological base. It is intendedin particular to increase the involvement of industryin areas of manufacturing technology, energy con-servation and waste reclamation, and to encourage the transfer of existing technology into industry.Savings will be made by selective cancellation of projects not connected with the above high priorityschemes.32. The supply of technical and research informa-tion to United Kingdom industry will be improved by the introduction of on-line computer basedmformation retrieval services in science and technology.33. The forecasts provide for support to the DesignCouncil by way of grant in aid to remain constantat  2 1 million in each year over the survey period.investment. Receipts include sales of pre-production instruments and machinery and levieson sales.35. Provision of  450,000 over the survey period for the Clothing Productivity Centre is included for the first time. Because of the importance of developing new computing applications, expenditureon software, systems and applications developmentcontracts will be increased from  850,000 in1977-78 to  2 million in 1981-82.Maintenance of existing policies36.  1 - 5 million a year has been found from this programme in each of the years 1977-78 to 1980-81to finance the Tin Buffer Stock arrangement; the requirement ceases in 1980-81, and it is proposedto increase the resources available for sponsorshipby  1 -5 million in that year.Aircraft and aero-engine general research anddevelopment37. This programme covers the Department ofIndustry&apos;s support for aeronautical technology and,together with work funded by industry, is aimed at providing a sound base from which internationallycompetitive projects can arise in the airframe, aero-engine and aviation equipment fields. British Aero-space will in due course assume responsibility forfunding research work on airframes in direct supportof its commercial activities but the extent of thedepartments continuing responsibilities remainsuncertain. There is however likely to be a con-tinuing requirement for research related to, forexample, protection of the environment, safety and fuel economy.Technological and industrial sponsorship34.The programme covers cost sharing research and development contracts with industry, univer-necessities and other research bodies, including somejointly financed with the e.c. and other european countries; pre-production orders for advancedmachinery, instrumentation and equipment; work by the National Environment Research Council onminerals intelligence and reconnaissance pro-Srammes; and grants for mineral exploration andSECRETConcorde38. The departments proposals cover the UnitedKingdom share of the cost of the currentlyauthorised programme of sixteen aircraft, includingspares and in-service support. No allowance hasbeen made in the forecasts for possible receipts from the sale or lease of the five unsold aircraft, norfor the implementation of the payments provisionsof the Anglo-French inter-company agreements forairframes and power-plants.   The forecasts show a25
steady decline in net expenditure as the production programme is completed and costs become increas-ingly confined to in-service support. additional provision is needed in 1978-79 to 1980-81 for a variety of reasons, in particular to provide for the adverse effect of diminishing direct employment onthe overhead rates of the airframe manufacturerand for engine in-service development.Maintenance of existing policies39. The Department of Industry have submittedadditional (or reduced) requirements for:  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-820-4	2-3	3-7	-1-4RB21140. This programme provides for government support to Rolls-Royce Ltd for the development and production of the RB 211-22B Engine and themore powerful RB 211-524.Maintenance of existing policies41. The Department of Industry have submitted the following reduced requirements:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82-	-8-6	-8-5	-4-7	-4-other aircraft and aero-engine projects42. Provision is sought for payments to theMinistry of Defence (Procurement Executive) forheadquarters services on behalf of the Departmentof Industry, for certain miscellaneous expenditure and receipts from levies on sales of civil aircraft and engines. An increased estimate of the pay-ments to be made to MOD(PE) for HQ costsaccount for the departments additional bids.Maintenance of existing policies43.   The Department of Industry have submittedadditional bids for:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-820-9	10	0-9	1-3	1-3SpaceNational44. The purpose of the national programme is tomaintain an independent source of research inorder to support the competitive position of theUnited Kingdom space industry. The work is currently divided almost equally between collabora-tive ventures with private industry and support forspace work carried out by RAE Farnborough.Proposals for new developments45.   The department have submitted additionalbids for this programme as follows:  million1978-79 1979-80 1980-81 1981-820-9 10 10 1046. When the United Kingdom joined theEuropean Space Agency (ESA) it was assumed that member countries would put all their expenditureon space into the Agency. This has not happened,and so it is necessary to maintain the previous levelof support to the UK industry in order that it canremain competitive. The additional  3-9 million over the survey period is sought to restore the element of direct support to the industry whichwould otherwise have declined sharply from1978-79 onwards, carrying with it the strongpossibility of the permanent break-up of skilleddesign teams, and the subsequent loss of export orders.International47. The programme covers the main part of theUnited Kingdom contribution to the european space Agency (ESA); the balance of the UnitedKingdom contribution is paid by the science research Council and is included in the provisionfor the Research Councils. The United kingdom is formally committed to all existing ESA pro-grammes on civil applications for satellites.
Maintenance of existing policies and proposed newdevelopments48. The department have submitted the following additional bids:  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-8211	1-9	2-5	3-049.  In 1978-79 and 1979-80 a further  1 -1 million and  1-9 million respectively are required to meet our existing international legal commitments, inparticular for the telecommunications programme.Recent negotiations with our ESA partners have indicated that the technical content of this pro-gramme will result in the total cost being higherthan earlier expected; the timing of our con-tributions   will   also   change.    The   additional requirements of  2-5 million and  3-0 million for1980-81  and 1981-82 respectively are to allow for United Kingdom participation in new ESAprogrammes at a practicable level, in order tomaintain a credible United Kingdom capacity inspace work, needed to take advantage of thefuture industrial opportunities.   The programmes are Spacelab Utilisation, for which a decision hasto be taken in 1977-78; and Remote SensingSatellite, Earthnet and the New telecommunications-cations (including Direct TV broadcasting) Pro-grammes, for which a decision will be required in1978-79.    These are  logical extensions  of thecurrent programmes, and are regarded by thedepartment as important to the future of theUnited Kingdom space industry.Proposals for new developments51. The department have submitted the following additional bids :  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82-	-	32-4	34-5	31-9These are equivalent to bids in cash terms of 43-5 million,  50 million and  50 million respectively.52. Ministers decided in December 1976 to allo-cate a further  50 million cash to the national enterprise Board (not) in each of the years1977-78 and 1978-79. The proposals are intendedto secure that, in cash terms, the allocation is main-tained at this level in subsequent years. In 1979-80the not&apos;s requirements are reduced by  6-5 million,cash, as the repayment of machine tool stock-building loans is expected in that year. No account has been taken of the current review of british leyland.53. Under the Industry Act, 1975 total out-standing borrowings and guarantees by the not(and its wholly-owned subsidiaries) may not exceed 1,000 million cash. If expenditure by the board should match the provision proposed, new legis-lation would be required well before the end ofthe survey period.54. It is for further consideration whether in the published White Paper the provision for the NEBshould be expressed for the first time in survey prices or if the previous (exceptional) practice ofshowing cash figures is to be maintained.GENERAL SUPPORT TO INDUSTRYNational enterprise board50. The figures in table 4 (and below) have been expressed for the first time in survey prices. Thecorresponding cash figures for the baseline are asfollows:  million1977-78      1978-79      1979-80     1980-81      1981-82275 225 225Selective assistance to individual industries, firms and undertakings55. The forecasts in table 4 of expenditure undersection 8 of the Industry Act, 1972 include pro-vision for counter-cyclical investment under the accelerated projects scheme, to which  120 million in cash was allocated; a range of schemes to assistthe modernisation of key sectors of industry, towhich  205 million cash has been allocated, inaddition to the  15 million already made availablefor the Wool Textile Industry Scheme, begun in1973; and the first two years of expenditure underthe Selective Investment Scheme, announced by theChancellor on 15 December, 1976.
56. The forecasts provide for grants and loans to Chrysler (UK) Ltd totalling  40-5 million cash,but not for the contingent liability for furthergrants of up to  34 million under the terms of the1975 rescue agreement. Pending completion of thecurrent review, provision has been included forassistance to British Leyland at the same levels asin Cmnd. 6721:  60 million cash in each of thefirst two years of the survey and  50 million cashin each of the years 1979-80 and 1980-81.Similarly,  50 million cash has been included asthe provisional requirement in 1981-82. Thesesums are in addition to the funds assumed to beavailable to British Leyland from the national enterprise Board ( 350 million over the survey period).Maintenance of existing policies57.   The department have the following additional(and reduced) requirements to permit the main-tenance of existing policies:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82-15-3	-12-7	20-7	30	-24-1The additional resources in 1979-80 and 1980-81are required to cope with the rephasing of expendi-ture under existing industry schemes from previous years, when significant consequential savings areanticipated.Refinancing of home shipbuilding lending58. This programme provides for the refinancingof part of the guaranteed credit made available bythe banks at a preferential fixed rate of interest to united Kingdom purchasers of ships built in UnitedKingdom shipyards. The refinancing is worked inconjunction with similar arrangements for exportcredit financing (see paragraphs 130-131 below).The service is demand-determined, and the re-financing depends upon the level of net shipbuildingadvances, the level of export lending and thethreshold below which finance is provided solely by the banks.59. The estimates are subject to a considerablemargin of error, particularly so this year becauseof the forthcoming renegotiation of the banks&apos; re-financing arrangements (described in more detail inthe section below on export credit refinancing).Compared with Cmnd. 6721, the latest forecastsshow a large increase which has to be treated asan additional bid. In 1977-78, this is mainly theresult of changes in the estimates of export lendingand the banks&apos; share of total refinancing. In later years it reflects a higher level of estimated ship-building advances, as a result of measures of assis-tance to the industry and the general trend to more expensive ships.Maintenance of existing policies60.   The additional bid is as follows:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-8227 0	90	16-0	100	110Assistance to the shipbuilding industry61. In February 1977 Ministers agreed to intro-duce an intervention fund to assist shipbuilders inGreat Britain to obtain orders. The baselinefigures in table 4 include the provision that wasthen made for this in 1977-78,1978-79 and 1979-80.Maintenance of existing policies62.   The additional (or reduced) requirements forthis programme, which assume that Vesting day for British Shipbuilders will be on 1 July 1977 as announced, are as follows:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-8210-4	8-8	0-3	-1-3	-1-663.  3 million of the additional bid for 1977-78results from rephasing of intervention fund expen-diture earlier allocated to 1976-77. Ministersaccepted that the main control on this expendi-ture should be the agreed ceiling on cashcommitments to March 1978. That ceiling isunaffected by rephasing. Other significant ad-ditional bids in this year are as follows:  2-1 million grants for accumulated losses of GovanShipbuilders to be paid on or about Vesting Day(this figure is still subject to negotiation with british Shipbuilders);  3-6 million for a claim under the home shipbuilding credit guaranteescheme, incurred as part of a cash deal approvedby Ministers, which resulted in a net saving to
public funds; and  12 million for loans in respectof Cammell Laird&apos;s redevelopment programme which will need to be made before Vesting Day.64. The bulk of the additional bid for 1978-79is accounted for by a reduction in loan reflows asa result of the establishment of British Shipbuilders( 4-7 million); and an estimating increase in ex-penditure on the cost escalation scheme ( 3-4 million).Investment grants65. The winding down of the investment grants scheme is proceeding as expected and provision isfor outstanding commitments:deduced	requirements		  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-821-5	0-2	0-7	1-0support for nationalised industries(other than the transport industries)Other compensation66.

The department have submitted an additionalbid for:...__                                                                million				1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-822-3	250	57-0	57-0	5808- This is a new programme designed to providea source of funds not firmly allocated to designatedProgrammes of expenditure to allow the depart-ment  flexibility  and  continuity  in planning its programmes in support of the industrial strategy.The overall resources devoted to the Department ofIndustry industrial support programme decline overthe survey period. This new sub-programme is designed to redress this decline to some extent. Itis envisaged that the main calls on these funds willbe shipbuilding subsidies, new industry schemes and extensions to existing schemes, minor rescuecases, fluctuations in the programme of assistanceto Chrysler and certain unforeseen items to beagreed with the Treasury; the departmentsfuture calls on the contingency reserve will be correspondingly reduced.SCOTTISH OFFICE69. The Scottish Office component of this pro-gramme comprises the Scottish DevelopmentAgency (SDA), selective financial assistance (sfa),the Highlands and Islands Development Board(HIDB), and the Scottish Tourist Board (STB).70. The Scottish Office have an additional bid onthis programme of  1-2 million in 1978-79,1979-80 and 1980-81 and  1-3 million in 1981-82on selective financial assistance, against which theyoffer no offsetting savings. The bid reflects lower than forecast revenue. In the view of the Treasuryit could be offset by savings within the same sub-programme. The Scottish Office also forecast nilrevenue under the Local Employment Act, 1972 in1981-82 compared with  1-5 million forecast in cmnd. 6721.71. Standard percentage reductions applied to allfour activities would yield a total of  2-3 million in 1978-79 and  4-7 million in 1979-80 and 4-6 million in later years. A cut in selectivefinancial assistance could only be made on a UnitedKingdom basis. A cut in the SDA provision wouldbe controversial politically. The Scottish office would regard cuts to either sub-programme as in conflict with the Governments industrial andemployment policies.WELSH OFFICE72. The Welsh Office component of this pro-gramme comprises the Welsh Development Agency(WDA), selective financial assistance (sfa), theDevelopment Board for Rural Wales (DBRW) andthe Wales Tourist Board (WTB).
73. Standard percentage reductions applied to allfour activities would yield a total of  1-2 million in 1978-79 and  2-4 million in later years. A cut in selective financial assistance could only be madeon a national basis. A cut in the WDA provision would be particularly controversial. The welsh office consider that reductions in expenditure ofthis order would conflict with the government&apos;s policy of regenerating industry and reducingunemployment.REGIONAL SUPPORT AND REGENERATIONScottish and Welsh Development Agencies74. The forecast is based on continuation of thepresent range of activities and is for the same levelof expenditure as Cmnd. 6721.75. The main objectives of the Agencies are to accelerate the economic and industrial developmentof Scotland and Wales and to improve the environ-ment consistently with that objective. In particular,they have the task of establishing or helping toestablish new industrial enterprises; encouraging thegrowth of existing enterprises; and of planning,developing, maintaining, and managing industrialestates in Scotland and Wales and providing advance and purpose-built factories. The Agencies also have responsibility for derelict land clearance pro-grammes and major environmental schemes.Special assistance for rural and highland areas76. This provision covers the Highlands and islands Development Board (HIDB) and theDevelopment Board for Rural Wales (DBRW).Provision for HIDB and DBRW is in line withCmnd. 6721.77. Standard percentage option cuts have been identified for the two boards.SUPPORT FOR NATIONALISED ENDUSTRD2S(OTHER THAN THE transport industries)Other compensation78. Provision is made for payment by the scottish office in 1977-78 to the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board towards its losses under the 1968contract with the British Aluminium Company atInvergordon and, in subsequent years, for lossesexpected to be incurred.DEPARTMENT OF ENERGYINDUSTRIAL INNOVATIONGeneral industrial research and developmentImplication of survey figures79. The Department of Energy&apos;s restricted research and development programme will continue in the fields of offshore oil and gas technology, geologicalstudies, safety of offshore installations, energy con-servation and new energy sources.80. No calls for additional funds are being madeat present, but it should be noted that if the firstphase of the present programme proves successful,there will be a requirement for increased expenditure for work on alternative sources (wave power seatrials in particular). There will also be new pro-grammes in energy conservation, research,development and demonstration (RD and D) andpossibly increased participation in coal utilisationRD and D. These items cannot be accommodated within the existing allocation and a bid may wellbe made next year for an increase from 1979-80.Options for reductions81. In order to meet the reduction required onthe Department of Energy&apos;s non-nuclear expendi-ture as a whole, the following contributions wouldbe required from R and D expenditure:  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-821-6	30	2-9	2-882. Reductions of this order would mean an11 per cent cut in the level of expenditure only recently judged by Ministers to be the minimumlevel necessary to enable the department to dis-charge its responsibilities effectively in this area.To reduce the scale of effort immediately aftersignificantly increasing our commitment to expand-ing programmes of work would involve difficultdecisions in view of the importance of the work toour future energy needs.NuclearImplication of survey figures83.   These figures are derived from the 1974 survey and have never been fully adjusted to take accountof the decision in that year to base the next nuclear power station orders on the Steam Generating
Heavy Water Reactor (SGHWR). From 1978-79onwards the figures will be inadequate to maintaincurrent policies on the development of nuclearreactor systems.Additional bids84. Nuclear policy is currently under review. Ifit is decided that our main reactor programmes should continue on their present bases, the followingestimated additional provision will be required:  million1978-79 1979-80 1980-81 1981-8213-2 19-8 9-3 14085. Dropping the SGHWR in favour of the advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) or PressurisedWater Reactor (PWR) should reduce the size of this additional requirement, though not eliminate it.To keep within the survey figures it would probablybe necessary not only to adopt one of these alter-native systems, but also to modify current policy on the Commercial Fast Reactor (CFR). even then the survey provisions might be insufficient inthe early years because of the need to provide forthe redeployment or redundancy of United kingdom atomic Energy Authority (sea) staff, particularly if the fast reactor programme were to be severelycurtailed.86. Additional provision may also be needed inconnection with the Joint European Torus (JET)Project. If it is sited in the United Kingdom, theprovision that will be required on the nuclear energy Vote is estimated at:  million1978-79 1979-80 1980-81 1981-825-6 6-6 4-8 2-5The Council Secretariat have suggested an increasein projected costs of about 11 per cent to take account of inflation. If this materialises the esti-mated provision above may need to be modified.87. if the JET project is sited elsewhere, or doesnot go ahead, additional provision of about halfthe above amount will none the less be required, to restore the reductions which have been applied tothe sea&apos;s underlying plasma physics and fusionProgramme in anticipation of JET being located inthe United Kingdom.88. The cost of providing a school for scientists&apos;children if JET is sited at Culham, which theDepartment of Energy consider should be theresponsibility of the Department of Education and science, would be:  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-821-3	0-2	0-2	0-289. The National Nuclear Corporation (NNC)might require an injection of capital in 1978-79 ofabout  10 million for the development of a manu-facturing capability; and the possibility of increasingthe Governmenfs share in the equity of the com-pany, at a cost of perhaps  2 million, may alsoarise. The need for these will depend in part onthe outcome of reviews.90. Current provision for R and D on radioactivewaste management and related studies may need to be revised in the light of the recommendationsof the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollu-tion, and additional provision may also be requiredto meet an increase in the costs of plutonium needed by the sea.91. A further possible requirement is the provisionof additional Government capital for British NuclearFuels Limited (BNFL). This would arise if BNFLcould not raise future capital requirements from private sector or overseas.	It could	be of thefollowing order:				  million1978-79          1979-80	1980-81	1981-8250                 30	20	10Options for reductions		92. No proposals for possible reductions can be identified until the outcome of current reactorpolicy reviews is known.GENERAL SUPPORT TO INDUSTRYSelective assistance to individual industries, firms and undertakingsImplication of survey figures93.   The Department of Energy&apos;s offshore suppliesinterest relief grant scheme, which is the major
part of this provision, will continue as planned.Provision for other assistance under section 8 ofthe Industry Act, 1972 is limited to approved pro-jects. Further projects for assistance undersection 8 might have to be considered as claims against the contingency reserve.Options for reductions94. In order to meet the reductions required onthe Department of Energy&apos;s non-nuclear programme as a whole, the following contribution would berequired from the offshore supplies interest reliefgrant (OSIRG) scheme:  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81          1981-8210	2 0	2-2                2-395. Ministers have agreed there should be nine months&apos; notice to the operators of any significant change to the scheme. Since any such cuts couldonly be considered in relation to new projects, thescheme would be completely emasculated, particu-larly in 1978-79. Such changes in the forecastsas would be required to achieve these reductions could only be contemplated if there was anothermajor economic crisis which justified the virtualdestruction of the OSIRG scheme. The department,therefore, does not regard such reductions as acceptable.Other support services  million1977-78      1978-79      1979-80      1980-81      1981-822-4 1-3 1-3 11 1-5Implication of survey figures96. The Department of Energy&apos;s contribution tothe offshore protection force and the missile safetysystem on the Cardigan Bay range will be met, butthe energy savings loan scheme and regionalenergy savings advisory services are due to ceaseon 31 March 1978.Additional bids97. It is proposed that the Department of Energy&apos;sregional energy saving advisory services shouldcontinue beyond 1977-78, but it is considered thatthe costs involved could be absorbed. The intro-duction of an energy saving interest relief grantscheme to replace the energy savings loan schemeis being considered by the Department of energy and the cost may have to be considered as a claim on the contingency reserve, as would be payments under guarantees in connection with platform sites and to financiers of development of North Sea Oilfields, should the guarantees be called. As yet noarrangements for financing the gas gathering pipe-line have been determined and no provision fora possible Department of Energy contribution istherefore included.SUPPORT FOR NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES(OTHER THAN THE transport industries)Assistance to the coal industryImplication of survey figures98. The provision covers the contributions to theMiners&apos; Pension Fund on the assumption that the contribution will increase in line with inflation tomeet additional deficiencies resulting from cost ofliving increases in the relevant pensions. It alsocovers continuing payments in connection with pitclosures; the Redundant Mineworkers PaymentsScheme and early retirement benefits resulting frompast and future pit closures; and grants to theNational Coal Board to facilitate a new coalburnagreement with the South of Scotland electricity board.Additional bids  million1977 1978 1979 1980 1981-78     -79     -80     -81      -82Coal stocking aid	9	0	9	6	30	3	0		Coke stocking aid	7	2	6	5	4-0	3	0	3	0Regional grant	10	0	10	0	100	10	0	10	0RMPS improvement.			0	6	0-6	0	6	0 0		26	2	26	7	17-6	16	6	13	699. Any case for regional grants would be related to the maintenance of employment in assisted areas and, if agreed by Ministers, might need to be con-sidered as a claim against the contingency reserve-At ENM (77) fifth meeting, Ministers agreed thatstocking aid for coal would be made available i&quot;
1977-78 as necessary and that stocking aid for cokecould also be provided if a case were made whichsatisfied Treasury that the costs of stocking couldnot be met through higher prices. It may be neces-sary to consider the provision of stocking and for coal and coke each year as claims against the con-contingency reserve. The improvements in the RMPShave already been conceded and therefore represent an inescapable bid for years after 1977-78.Options for reductions100. The figures for grants above assume thatwhen the powers in the Coal Industry Bill (now before Parliament) expire in March 1981 the redundant Mineworkers Payment Scheme and grants connected with pit closures will be extended by Order for a year as provided for in the Bill. Itmight prove possible to reduce the scale of grants for March 1981 and their scope will be kept underreview. But it is unlikely to be politically practic-able to do away with them.Other compensationImplication of survey figures101. The Department of Energy will meet its com-commitment to compensate the Central electricity generating Board (CEGB) for the cost of acceleration-ting the construction of the Ince B power station.102. A claim by the CEGB for compensation forthe costs involved would almost certainly result from any decision to advance the Drax B power station to 1977.Other servicesImplication of survey figures103. Any form of assistance to poor energy con-sumers which was to be financed by the DepartmentQf Energy vote in the winter of 1977-78 and sub-Sequently might need to be considered as a claimagainst the contingency reserve.CENTRAL AND MISCELLANEOUS SERVICESImplication of survey figures104.  The Department of Energy can continue tocarry out their functions, even though further re-reductions over and above those of about 5 per centmiposed last autumn have been achieved.^05. A decision has still to be made on thequestion of payment by the Department of Energyto the Channel Islands of a proportion of theroyalty revenues from the Continental Shelf. this may have to be considered as a claim on the con-contingency reserve. The department believe the costs are likely to be negligible.Options for reductions106. In order to meet the reductions on theDepartment of Energy&apos;s non-nuclear programme asa whole, the following contribution would berequired from the departments staff and associatedcosts.  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-820-2	0-4	0-5	0-5107. Reductions of this order would reduce theefficiency and range of non-statutory services whichthe department maintains.DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENTFUNCTIONING OF THE LABOUR MARKETImplications of survey figures108. This programme aims to improve thefunctioning of the labour market through theservices provided by the Department of Employ-ment, the Manpower Services Commission and localauthorities. The expenditure of the Commissionand its two executive arms, the employment service Agency (ESA) and the Training ServicesAgency (TSA), is mainly financed by a grant in aid.Certain schemes for training, employment transfer,rehabilitation of the handicapped, and careerdevelopment of young people are eligible forassistance from the European Social Fund.Manpower Services Commission109. The Commission carries out its functionswithin a general policy framework agreed with theSecretary of State for Employment. Expenditureincludes temporary additional resources (some  80million in 1977-78 and some  36 million in1978-79) to provide additional employment andtraining facilities to mitigate the effects of high unemployment. These resources include provisionfor the work experience programme (run by theCommission itself) which aims to provide 30,000
unemployed young people with first hand workexperience. The Commission also operates the jobcreation programme on behalf of the department.Employment services and employment rehabilitation110. The main expenditure is on the placingservice of the ESA. The existing provision enables the Agency to continue with its plans for im-proving its services to the labour market and to employers and job seekers. Some 297 job centreswere opened by the end of 1976-77 and the surveyfigures will support about 100 new centres a year.Rehabilitation facilities are provided for about15,000 persons a year in various types of employ -ment rehabilitation centres. The forecasts covering the employment transfer scheme are based on thepresent grants and facilities for assisting labourmobility; the ESA is currently reviewing thescheme.111. A special grant of  1-5 million in 1977-78and  1-6 million in 1978-79 has been provided tostrengthen the careers service operated by localauthorities as part of the measures to alleviatehigh unemployment amongst young people. the forecasts of local authority expenditure allow fordemographic growth.  4-7 million has also beenprovided in 1977-78 for payment to employers ofa recruitment subsidy for young people who havebeen unemployed for more than six months.Industrial training112. Additional provision has been made in1977-78 ( 63 million) and 1978-79 ( 36 million) toassist apprentice and other training in a period of high unemployment. The continued effect of theimprovement in training allowances made as partof earlier measures in 1975-76 is reflected in the survey figures. In Cmnd. 6721 the TSA&apos;s target for direct training, mainly in skill centres and colleges of further education, was set at 85,000for 1977-78 rising to 100,000 in 1980-81. the survey provision could support a somewhat highertarget.Redundancy and maternity pay funds payments113. The survey provision is insufficient for current forecasts for basic payments from the redundancy fund and recent developments in thefund affecting 1977-78 and subsequent years. the survey figures for the maternity pay fund are sufficient to meet the payments expected to bemade to employers in respect of 185,000 women in1977-78 and 221,000 in each of the later years.Industrial relations and other labour market services114. This includes the Advisory, Conciliation and arbitration Service, the Office of ManpowerEconomics and Department of Employment staff engaged on manpower policy, incomes and in-dustrial relations work. Substantial extra provision has been made in this programme for temporarymeasures to alleviate the current high level ofunemployment.  226 million in 1977-78 and 130 million in 1978-79 have been providedfor the temporary employment subsidy payable to certain employers who are prepared to retainemployees who would otherwise be redundant. 60 million in 1977-78 and  28 million in1978-79 has been allocated for the job creationprogramme (run by the MSC) which supports pro-jects sponsored by local authorities, voluntary bodies and others to provide socially-useful workfor unemployed persons and particularly for unem-ployed young people. Two more recent measures are the job release scheme ( 53 million in 1977-78and  3 million in 1978-79) which provides for thepayment of allowances to certain employed andunemployed persons nearing pensionable age toencourage the creation of vacancies and reduce thelevel of unemployment; and the small firmsemployment subsidy ( 2 million in 1977-78 and 1 million in 1978-79) which offers grants for sixmonths to manufacturing firms in special develop-ment areas employing fewer than fifty workers foreach additional worker taken on. The grant to community industry has also been increased in1977-78 and 1978-79 to raise the number of placesprovided to socially-disadvantaged and unemployedyoung people from 4,000 to 5,500.Additional or reduced requirementsEmployment services and employmentrehabilitation  million1978-79 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82-5-2 - -0-6 -0-6

The savings are due to a revision of allow-ances for dependants, to remove sex discrimination,reduced needs for skill centre equipment and because of a greater proportion of young people on training courses for whom allowances are lowerand courses generally shorter.Redundancy and maternity pay funds payments  million1978-79 1979-80 1980-81 1981-8215-8 5-7 5-7 5-7117.   Additional provision is required because:(a) the fall in the number of basic payments overthe survey period is now expected to be con-siderably slower than previously forecast;(b) payments under the insolvency provision ofthe Employment Protection Act, 1975 are more than previously forecast;(c) the proportion of guarantee payments hasalso increased;(d) administration costs will be higher, in line with the new forecasts.118. No savings are possible within the redundancies-dancy fund to meet the additional requirements.But experience suggests that forecasts of eligibleredundancies are liable to considerable further changes.Industrial relations and other labour marketservices  million1978-79 1979-80 1980-81 1981-821-7SECRET119.

The Holland Working Party on young people and work has reported on the feasibility ofa new programme of opportunities for unemployedyoung people. The aim of the proposed pro-gramme is to provide a more coherent and extensive range of opportunities for unemployedyoung people aged 16-18 related to present and prospective levels of youth unemployment. Theabove figures allow for additional expenditure on some current temporary measures until the new programme. commences, and also for the presentprovision for community industry. The figuresfor the later years could be subject to annual review.  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-822-9	2-3	2-4	2-4121.

Expenditure on items (a), (b), id) and (e)is by central government; that on item (c) is bylocal authorities. There would also be some con-sequential staff savings with item (a). Theseoptions are from the MSCs activities. excluding the redundancy fund, further amounts of  5-5 million in 1978-79 and a little less than  3-million in each of the later years would be needed to meet reductions of 2\ per cent and 5 per cent from the rest of the programmes. By the natureof the expenditure other options would involve:(i) severe staff cuts which in practice would be slow to provide actual savings;(ii) reductions in grants to local authorities with the likely result of overspending;(iii) cutting back expenditure on special measuresintended to mitigate the effects of high unemployment.CENTRAL AND MISCELLANEOUS SERVICESEmployment124. This programme covers expenditure on services for the seriously disabled, international relations work (mainly the United Kingdom sub-scription to the International Labour Organisation),the Royal Commission on Distribution of income and Wealth and central and common services.The survey figures will support the present volumeof work and allow some savings in most years.125. Services for the seriously disabled consist mainly of grants to Remploy Limited, local authori-ties and other bodies providing training and em-ployment under sheltered conditions. The fore-casts support a modest rate of expansion in thenumber of workers until 1980-81.Additional	or reduced requirements			  million1978-79	1979-80          1980-81	1981-82-3-6	-2-9             -1-6	-126. The savings reflect a revised assessment of administrative costs.Options for reductions127. Reductions of  1-2 million in 1978-79 and 2-4 million in later years from this programmed could only be made by staff cuts, or by savings ongrants to local authorities and other bodies, withthe effect referred to in paragraph 123.HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK128. The Health and Safety Commission, and itsexecutive arm the Health and Safety Executive,carries out its functions within a general policyframework agreed with the Secretary of State for employment. The Commission is financed bygrant in aid, and the programme covers the detaileddevelopment of policies implicit in the Health and safety at Work etc. Act, 1974, which extendedprotection to some 8 million employees not pre-viously covered. The survey allows some pro-vision for increasing the staff of the factory inspectorate in accordance with Ministerial under-takings, but the Commission has had to delaycertain parts of its programme of developments andit will be some time before it is able to meet all its responsibilities under the Act.Additional requirements  million1978-79    1979-80    1980-81    1981-82Minor items     .       0-1 0-1 1-3 2-1Options for reductions129.

EXPORT CREDITS GUARANTEEDEPARTMENTINTERNATIONAL TRADERefinancing of fixed rate export credits130. The United Kingdom, like most of the mainindustrial countries, offers medium and long-termcredit at a fixed rate for major capital goods. Thescheme also covers shipbuilding. This expenditure is the Export Credits Guarantee Departments(ECGD) share of the cost of refinancing that partof the fixed rate credit extended by the clearing banks for exports and home shipbuilding whichexceeds 21 per cent of their non-interest-bearingsterling sight deposits in 1977-78 and 22 per centthereafter. The share attributed to home ship-building is met by the Department of Industry and shown separately (paragraphs 58-59 above). Theexpenditure recorded represents the net additionto refinancing in the relevant year.131.  Expenditure on refinancing in any one year&apos;s  determined by two main variables:  the net increase in the level of fixed rate export lending inthat year, and the level of the threshold below whichthe banks are required to finance the lending them-selves.   Over the past three years or so the levelof fixed rate lending outstanding has increasedrapidly involving very large increases in current andforecast  expenditure  on  refinancing.    Ministerstherefore decided in December  1976 that this expenditure   should   be   reduced.    Savings   of 100 million in  1977-78  and  200 million in1978-79   were   announced.    However,   forecastexpenditure had already risen above previouslyplanned levels so that to achieve these net savings,gross savings of  250 million and  350 million were needed.  These savings were to be secured in two main ways.   First, the clearing banks agreed tomcrease the unrefinanceable proportion of theirfixed rate export credit from 18 per cent to 21 percent of their sterling sight deposits with effect from1 April 1977, and to 22 per cent from 1 April 1978.Second, a ceiling was imposed on the additionalrefinancing which could be undertaken by thedepartment in those two years and steps have beentaken to encourage a switch to the use of foreign currency to finance exports since foreign currencycredits do not automatically have to be refinancedhy the Government.132. The table below shows the additional re-financing requirement for each year.  These figures are always highly provisional and the underlyingassumptions subject to major revision. This yearthey are particularly sensitive to the uncertaintiesconcerning the speed with which the measures toencourage foreign currency financing will take effect.Moreover, the forecasts assume the banks will from1978-79 onwards provide a contribution equal to22 per cent of the relevant deposits, but thisarrangement may be changed since the scheme isnow being renegotiated with the banks (see below):  million	1977	1978	1979	1980	1981	-78	-79	-80	-81	-82Revised estimates	514	468	425	435	470Cmnd. 6721	393	359	-	-	-Additional bids .	121	109	-	-	35133. There are additional bids in 1977-78 and1978-79 because the level of non-interest-bearingsterling sight deposits is now forecast to be lower than expected last December. Thus the contribu-tion from the banks will be lower. This is an element of the scheme which is completely outsideECGD&apos;s control and, at the time of the December1976 measures, it was agreed that the departmentscapacity to refinance sterling credit would not befurther restricted as a result of changes in the levelof these deposits. The additional bid in 1981-82arises because the guidelines do not allow the survey figure for 1981-82 to exceed the figure for1980-81. However, the forecasts show an increasein refinancing although, as pointed out above, thefigures are highly provisional.Options for reductions134. There are only two ways in which public expenditure on the refinancing scheme can be curtailed:(i) by obtaining or attracting a larger contribu-tion from the clearing banks or other private sector financial institutions which would notbe refinanceable with ECGD, and(ii) by restricting exporters&apos; access to sterlingfixed rate export credit.Both measures are already being applied as a partof the December 1976 public expenditure cuts.However, the agreement with the clearing banksunder which the scheme is operated expires inOctober this year and is currently under review.
Ways in which the scheme could be revised inorder to increase the amount of private sectorfinance contributed and to reduce expenditure onrefinancing by the Government are being urgentlyconsidered.135. Reductions of 2\ per cent in 1978-79 and5 per cent in later years could be achieved by either of the ways described in paragraph 134 above but(ii) produces results more slowly than (i) and,unless financing in foreign currency can bearranged, could curtail the level of capital goodsexports; (i) has to be negotiated with the institutionsconcerned.Cost escalation scheme136. The Export Credits Guarantee department is empowered by the Export Guarantees Act, 1975to provide insurance against increases in certaincosts of performing export contracts involvingcapital goods. These powers extend to 26 March1978 after which, if the scheme were to be continued,they would need to be renewed annually by Parlia-ment. The costs below relate only to present commitments and those expected to be given before26 March 1978.137. This expenditure represents the extent towhich payments to exporters under guarantees, and administration costs, are expected to exceed theincome from premia. From 1977-78 to 1981-82net expenditure of  7-4 million is forecast. Thisforecast, which shows lower net expenditure on thescheme than the Cmnd. 6721 figures, is howeverbased on present estimates of the rate of inflation,maintenance of the current level of demand fromexporters for the scheme and the extent to whichthey are succesful in obtaining contracts. All these factors continue to be subject to a great deal of uncertainty.Additional bids138. The following table compares the revised estimates with those in Cmnd. 6721:  million1977 1978 1979 1980 1981-78     -79     -80     -81     -821. Revised estimates . 0-6 1-4 1-3 3 7 0-42.

The only additional bid arises in 1980-81.Since this expenditure in large part relates to com-commitments or contingent commitments alreadyassumed by ECGD, there is no way in which this can be avoided.DEPARTMENT OF TRADE140.   Although the department are not proposingnew policies, they seek changes compared withCmnd. 6721 for the maintenance of their existing policies on programme 4 as follows:  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-823-2	30	4-0	-141. This is more than accounted for by a short-fall in receipts from Patent Office and CompaniesRegistration Office fees compared with those forecast in Cmnd. 6721.  The shortfall in fees amounts to:  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-813-3	3-5	4-0142. The department cannot recover the shortfallby raising fees because the two organisations are showing profits and higher fees would conflict with treasury policy and could be ultra-vires. Thedepartment takes the view that it should not berequired to identify offsetting savings for thisinescapable increase in its forecast net expenditure.143. Leaving on one side the Companies Registra-tion Office and the Patent Office, the departmentsoverall position on programme 4 becomes:  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82-01	-0-5	-	-These figures should be read in conjunction withthe departments position on programme 6.Options for reductions144. The only Department of Trade programmeswith any real flexibility fall on programme 4 rather
4.   Trade, Industry and Employmentthan programme 6. Out of the departments totaloption cuts on both programmes of  2-7 million in1978-79,  5-0 million in 1979-80 and  4-6 millionsubsequently, the principal contributions are fromtourism ( 1 million and  2 million) and exportpromotion ( 1-5 million and  2 million). (Furthersmall savings are however offered on shipping services and other civil aviation services from pro-gramme 6.) The department takes the view thatsuch cuts would be unduly damaging and could becounter-productive.GENERAL SUPPORT TO INDUSTRYPromotion of tourism145. Provision is made for the continuation of the grants in aid to the British Tourist Authority andthe English, Scottish and Wales Tourist boards and for selective assistance for tourist projects in development areas under section 4 of the Develop-rnent of Tourism Act, 1969. The forecasts are in line with Cmnd. 6721.Other support services146. Provision is made in 1977-78 for final pay-ments to the National Film Finance corporation under existing legislation and in 1978-79 forassistance under the proposed new legislation.INTERNATIONAL TRADEExport promotion and trade co-operation147. Provision is made for expenditure on exportPromotion services, which are managed by theBritish Overseas Trade Board, and for subscriptions-tions to international organisations. The pro-gramme covers a wide range of support schemes.The largest item consists of assistance to Britishexhibitors at overseas trade fairs. Other servicesinclude technical help to exporters, assistance withresearch and training, the overseas projects fund and grants in aid and selective grants to non-official trade organisations.REGULATION OF DOMESTIC TRADE ANDINDUSTRY AND CONSUMERPROTECTIONProtection of innovation148. Provision is made for the salaries andgeneral administration expenses of the PatentOffice, for the United Kingdom contribution tothe European Patent Office, and for certain inter-SECRETnational subscriptions. Forecast receipts exceedexpenditure but there is a decrease in the net totalof receipts compared with Cmnd. 6721. This is because the Patent Office is already showing anexcess of receipts over full costs, and fees cannot therefore be raised to match their revalued total.There is a small saving compared with Cmnd.6721 on expenditure on international subscriptions.A site in the United Kingdom has been offered forthe European Community Trade Marks Office, but no provision has been made for any expenditure inconnection with this.Regulation   of  trading  practices   and   consumerprotection149.   Provision is made for the Department ofTrade&apos;s expenditure on salaries and general ad-ministrative expenses, less receipts from fees, inconnection   with   the   departments   insurance,companies    and    insolvency    service    divisions,including the Companies Registration Office.   the forecasts from 1978-79 include receipts from feesto recover the cost of the Registry of BusinessNames; these will depend on the passage of thenecessary legislation.   Receipts on this programmeexceed expenditure, but the net total of receipts islower than in Cmnd. 6721.  This is mainly becausethe   Companies   Registration  Office   is   alreadyshowing an excess of receipts over full costs andfees cannot therefore be raised to match then-revalued total.CENTRAL AND MISCELLANEOUS SERVICES150. Provision is made for salaries, administrative and miscellaneous expenses of the department(except those of the Patent Office and insurance,companies and insolvency divisions, which areborne on the relevant sub-programmes).DEPARTMENT OF PRICES AND CONSUMERPROTECTION151. The total of additional bids by the Depart-ment of Prices and Consumer Protection onprogramme 4 is as follows:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82-	7-6	7-5	7-5	7-5(The department also has a minor additional bidon programme 8.)
152. About half is required for the price commission and Metrication Board which thedepartment considers necessary to carry outpresent Government policy. The department doesnot therefore believe it should be expected to identify offsetting savings to that extent. Thisleaves an additional bid of  3-7 million in 1978-79and  3-8 million in later years reflecting thedepartments bid to continue to make grants toconsumer advice centres, for which there is no provision beyond 1977-78. The department is notable to offer offsetting savings for this additional expenditure. (There is a reduction of  2-3 million in 1979-80 and later years as a result of thewithdrawal of the token provision for food subsidies in programme 3 but this is not a genuine saving.)153. The department has identified option cutswhich do not exceed  1 million in any one yearbut believes that the damage caused by such cuts would be disproportionate to the saving in expenditure.REGULATION OF DOMESTIC TRADE ANDINDUSTRY AND CONSUMERPROTECTIONRegulation  of  trading  practices  and  consumerprotection154. Provision is made for the Department ofPrices and Consumer Protection^ expenditure onthe Monopolies and Mergers Commission; support for the National Council of Social Service in con-nection with citizen&apos;s advice bureaux; the NationalConsumer Council; five nationalised industryconsumer councils; the Royal Society for thePrevention of Accidents; and for research into the safety of consumer goods. Provision is made in1977-78 for price comparison surveys and support for consumer advice centres.Additional bid155. There is an additional bid of  3-7 million in1978-79 and  3-8 million in later years, reflectingthe view of the department that support for con-sumer advice centres should continue at its present level through the later years of the survey period.The department is not able to find savings to offsetthese increases.Standards and quality assurance156. Provision is made for the grant in aid tothe British Standards Institution; for the Metri-cation Board; for quality assurance schemes; andsubscriptions to two international organisations.There is a small additional bid compared with theprovision in Cmnd. 6721, reflecting the need toextend the life of the Metrication Board to theend of the survey period.CENTRAL AND MISCELLANEOUS SERVICES157. Provision is made for the staff and generaladministrative expenses of the Department of prices and Consumer Protection, and for the price commission.Additional bid158. There is an additional bid of  3-6 million a year from 1978-79 onwards for the maintenanceof the Price Commission reflecting Ministers&apos; agree-ment to a prices policy on a continuing basis. Thedepartment does not feel it should be expected tooffer offsetting savings for this additional expen-diture and anyway is unable to find such savings.DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENTREGIONAL SUPPORT AND REGENERATIONProvision for land and buildingsSpecial assistance for rural and highland areas159. This provision is for the development commission.Additional bid160. There is an additional bid of  3-2 million in1978-79 and  3-8 million for 1979-80 and subse-quent years. Offsetting savings have not been identified. The increase is sought to enable theDevelopment Commission to carry out employmentcreation programmes through the provision of advance factories. The department and the Com-mission consider that these fulfil the objectives ofthe Ministerial decision of December 1974 that measures to stem rural depopulation should beincreased. A start has been possible during1976-77 and 1977-78 only through the provision of funds outside the Development Commission^ survey
provisions from the employment creation pro-grammes, Department of Environment savings else-where and the contingency reserve. without additional funds for subsequent years the Corn-mission will be unable to sustain their current levelof activity. Following a meeting held by theMinister of State at the Treasury in March 1977(when the Commission^ 1977-78 resources were increased to  2 million over the survey allocation)it was decided that the question of the development commission^ request for funds should be pursued by Ministers collectively in the context of the 1977survey.161. Standard percentage option cuts have been identified. In the departments opinion, the Cmnd.6721 Development Commission survey figures (anda fortiori any cuts in those figures) would involve a4.  Trade, Industry and Employmentsharp cut back in programmes, Government support for which was very recently confirmed and expanded.OFFICE OF FAIR TRADINGREGULATION OF DOMESTIC TRADE ANDINDUSTRY AND CONSUMERPROTECTIONRegulation of trading practices and consumerprotection162. The programme provides for the continuanceof the statutory functions of the Office of FairTrading with respect to monopolies and mergers,restrictive trade practices, consumer protection and consumer credit. Expenditure incurred in theadministration of the Consumer Credit Act, 1974 ismet from fees.41

The investment and financing of the nationa-lised industries is the subject of a separate review.The first line in the table shows the forecast totalsof net borrowing by the nationalised industries:that is, their loans, other than short term, from all sources and the public dividend capital issued tosome of them. The third line shows, after an adjustment in the second line for overseas and market net borrowing, the totals of net governmentlending to the industries.2. The totals, together with the figures for theindividual industries and options for reductions, are discussed in detail in the separate report to ministers on the investment and financing of the nationalised industries. The figures reflect the outcome of recent discussions which took place between depart-ments and the industries in preparation for the review: they thus differ in kind from the &quot; base-line &quot; figures shown for other programmes.3. The main reasons for the increase of  82million in net government lending in 1978-79 by comparison with Cmnd. 6721 revalued, are newprovision for British Shipbuilders, substantially increased provision for the British Steel Corpora-tion, and an allowance for new foreign borrowinglower than was assumed in Cmnd. 6721. Thereduction in 1977-78 reflects the higher level of netforeign currency borrowing now forecast. In the later years there are substantial reductions by comparison with the figures prepared, but not published, at the time of Cmnd. 6721. This is due mainly to revised figures for foreign borrowing andfor British Steel, British Gas and the Post Office.These are explained in the separate review.

The Governmenfs White Paper on transport policy is under consideration by Ministers. Thefollowing proposals are, therefore, subject to amendment in the light of decisions in that context.MOTORWAYS AND TRUNK ROADS, ANDLOCAL TRANSPORTENGLAND AND WALESImplication of survey figures2.   Cmnd. 6721 provides for a total reduction of 5per cent in these programmes between 1977-78and 1978-79, with some recovery at the end of the survey period. The provision allows only limitedscope for new motorways and trunk road schemes in England. In Wales, all of which has some formof assisted area status, effort is being concen-trated on improving east-west communications inview of their importance to industrial development3. Allocation of local transport expenditure inEngland and Wales will be subject to discussionwith the local authority associations in the light ofthe White Paper on Transport. Within the baselineprovision for local transport there is little scope
in the early years for new road schemes. Expen-diture on bus, underground and ferry subsidies isprojected to fall by 1980-81 to less than half the1977-78 level and the provision for concessionaryfares does not allow for any improvement in existing schemes. However, there seems little prospect of local authorities implementing the re-duction in subsidies. Some allowance may also need to be made for extending concessionary tares.It is likely, therefore, that the provision for these items will need to be increased by about  40million in 1978-79 rising to perhaps  100 million by 1980-81.4- To offset these increases, local authorities would be expected to reduce their current expen-diture on other items and hold back their capital investment in later years. But it would be neces-sary to find further savings from motorway andtrunk road construction. In the Department of transports view, it will be particularly difficult tofind sufficient savings in 1978-79 on English trunk roads to offset increased expenditure on subsidies,because of the low level of starts in that yearresulting from the public expenditure reductionsannounced in 1976. Thereafter, offsetting savingsare likely to be found only by holding the motor-way and trunk road programme to about  300million. The programme would then be running at the lowest level since the early 1960s.Proposals for new developments5- The Department of Transport consider that,as a consequence of the situation described above,an addition to the total provision for motorwaysand trunk roads and local transport in England isrequired to enable the subsidies for public trans-Port to be maintained at the 1977-78 level, whilemitigating to some extent the reductions in themotorway and trunk road programme. After taking account of offsetting savings within programme 6,the additional provision they propose is:  million1978-791979-801980-811981-8220202050ne Treasury consider that the existing provisionjs sufficient to allow for increased subsidies whileeaving an adequate motorway and trunk road programme. In their view, therefore, an addition tothe programme 6 totals would not be justified.6. Additional provision on local authority adminis-tration will be required to implement the health and Safety at Work etc. Act, 1974 in England andWales. The figures, which may need adjustment in the light of experience, are:  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82-	1-9	1-9	1-9Options for reductions7. The 2  per cent and 5 per cent reductions in1978-79 and later years respectively would be:  million	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82England	37-8	74-2	75-4	75-4Wales	3-4	6-9	6-9	6-98. Given that the changes in expenditure outlined above will require the motorway and trunk road programme to be held at about its 1978-79 levelin the later years, the Department of Transportconsider that there is no scope for further reductions,which would have serious implications for analready depressed road construction industry. the welsh Office consider that their motorway andtrunk road construction programme has laggedbehind that of the rest of Great Britain. The Welshprogramme has therefore been partially shieldedagainst cuts in the past and the Welsh Office believe it would be a false economy to reduce expenditurein this field. Savings that might be secured fromexpenditure on local transport in England andWales are likely to be needed to offset increased expenditure on subsidies. In the departments&apos;view therefore, the illustrative reductions would haveto be sought from a reduction in subsidies to localtransport, a policy which the local authorities are unlikely to implement.9. The Treasury agree that it would not be feasible to achieve any reduction in 1978-79, given the low level of road construction starts in that year. How-ever, they consider that the savings in later yearscould be achieved. Public transport investmentmight be expected to contribute  15-20 million a
year in the last two years of the survey as com-mitted works are completed, while economies in local authority administration might yield  5 million a year. The feasibility of these reductions would,however, have to be discussed with the localauthorities. The balance could be found from road construction. The Welsh Office programmes couldbe expected to contribute an appropriate proportionof any reductions required.SCOTLANDImplication of survey figures10. There is adequate provision for new motorwaysand trunk road schemes but as a consequence oflast year&apos;s public expenditure reductions someschemes have been delayed including motorways in central Scotland and improvement of trunk roadsrelated to oil developments. In contrast to Englandand Wales, there are unlikely to be significantswitches from motorway and trunk road construc-tion to local transport.11. The allocation of the provision for local trans-port will depend on decisions by regional and islandscouncils, who are free to decide their own priorities.The total is adequate but some adjustment betweensub-programmes is likely to be needed, in particularan increase for road maintenance offset by reductions in expenditure on transport subsidies and conces-commisionary fares. There is a small additional bid onthis programme for 1979-80 to 1981-82.Options for reductions12. The 2\ per cent and 5 per cent reductions in1978-79 and later years respectively would be:  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-826 1	12-6	12-8	12-8The application of the illustrative reductions to central government expenditure on roads wouldmean further significant delays to important schemes in the trunk road programme. The reductions in local transport current and capital expenditure would require restriction of the provision for passenger transport subsidies and concessionaryfares, and difficult further postponement of road schemes.CENTRAL GOVERNMENT SUPPORTBritish Railways Board13. The largest item in this block is support tothe British Railways Board. Passenger subsidiesenable the Board to meet the public service obliga-tion laid on it by the Government under theRailways Act, 1974 and, as proposed in Cmnd. 6721,are assumed not to increase in real terms over the survey period. The provision for 1977-78 was reduced as a contribution towards the cuts in public expenditure announced on 15 December 1976.Transitional grants introduced in 1975 to meetfreight losses are not expected to continue beyondthe end of 1977. The Board&apos;s historic pensionsliabilities are also supported, including from 1979-80provision for capital payments to put its pensionfunds on a properly funded basis. Total subsidiesare:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82465-2	418-8	430-7	430-7	430-7Implications of survey figures14. It is already clear that, unless operating costscan be reduced and revenue increased by higherfares and charges, maintenance and renewal ofinfrastructure, which is charged to revenue account,will fall increasingly into arrears. In time thiswould result in some services being curtailed and eventually withdrawn.Options for reductions15.   The illustrative reductions are as follows:  million1978-79 1979-80 1980-81 1981-8210-5 21-5 21-5 21-5As the pensions provision represents the expectedcost of existing statutory commitments, the railwaybusiness would bear the brunt of any such re-reductions. They could not however be immediatelyabsorbed by operating economies or price increases,the benefits from which only mature over a periodof years. The impact would therefore fall on maintenance and thus hasten any curtailment of services.
National Freight Corporation16. Since January 1976 the National freight corporation has been receiving transitional grantwhile a review of its future strategy and require-ments was undertaken. A report by consultants hasbeen completed and a draft corporate plan produced by the Corporation, and these together with theconclusions published in the Transport White paper should result in proposals for legislation during thenext session of Parliament. In the meantime, pro-vision for grant has been sought only until the endof 1977-78, for which specific statutory authority has been sought in the Transport (Financial Pro-visions) Bill. The provision for 1977-78, whichhas been balanced by a corresponding reduction inthe NFCs investment programme, is  27-9 million.Scottish Transport GroupImplications of survey figures17. Provision is made for the Scottish TransportGroup to continue to receive revenue grant related to the deficit of the shipping subsidiaries DavidMacBrayne and Caledonian MacBrayne, which runpassenger and freight services to the west coast ofScotland and which have no prospect of increasingrevenue sufficiently to cover costs. The Treasurybelieve that the existing level of support is toogenerous, being greater in all years than the Scottish transport Group&apos;s own forecasts.Options for reductions18. The percentage reductions specified in theguidelines would amount to  0 1 million in1978-79 and  0-2 million in each of the years1979-80 to 1981-82. The Scottish Office believethat this option might require increases in revenue from fares in real terms relative to costs. TheTreasury believe that much greater reductions would be feasible without significantly increasingreal fares and that, following the Group&apos;s fore-casts, the savings would be:  million1978-790-91979-801980-811981-821-21-41-6he Scottish Office consider that the forecastscannot be relied on and that significant real fare^creases would be required to achieve the Group&apos;s^recasts.New bus grants to nationalised industries and private operatorsImplications of survey figures19. These are 50 per cent grants made towardsthe cost of buying new buses for use on stageservices. Total investment in new buses by localauthorities appears as part of their public transportinvestment and only the grants to the National bus company, Scottish Transport Group, the Post Officeand private operators are shown here. Powers topay the grants expire in September 1980 and no provision is made beyond that date. Total pro-vision for roads and transport in 1980-81 and1981-82 is correspondingly lower. However, theDepartment of Transport have proposed an exten-sion of the life of the grants to 1985, on a reducingbasis.Proposals for new developments20.   If Ministers agree to the above proposal itwill be necessary to increase provision in 1980-81and 1981-82:  million1978-79          1979-80	1980-81	1981-82--                 -	10-3	16-6Options for reductions 21.   The   illustrative savings of:	reductions	would   involve   million1978-79          1979-80	1980-81	1981-820-5                1-0	0-5	-These could be achieved by reducing the number ofbuses eligible for grant. The grant to the localauthorities would have to be similarly reduced.Other22. Under the Railways Act, 1974 grants are madeto public and private bodies towards the provisionof their own facilities for loading or unloading railfreight. The proposed provision is  8-4 million a year for the survey period, the same as Cmnd.6721.SECRET49
Options for reductions23. The illustrative reductions would be 0-2 million in 1978-79 and  0-4 million a yearthereafter. Such reductions while not seriouslyaffecting the progress of the freight facilities scheme might be taken to imply a weakening in the Govern-ment&apos;s commitment to secure transfers of freightfrom road to rail where these are justified oneconomic, environmental or social grounds.PORTS AND SfflPPINGPortsImplications of survey figures24. The provision embraces port investment bythe independent public trust ports and by localauthority ports, and loans to ports in the private sector. If reflects the continuing needs of north sea Oil developments, in particular the further extension of the oil terminal at Sullom Voe in the later years, and various port developments requiredfor specific industrial purposes and the growth ofcontainerisation. The figures do not include any expenditure arising from the Governments pro-posals for public ownership of ports and portsbusinesses. No provision is made for government financial assistance to the Port of London Authoritysince it is now envisaged that its requirements willbe met by a loan from the private banking sector.25. The programme includes minimal provisionfor grants and loans to independent harbour trustsand local authority harbours. In addition there isprovision for a tanker jetty at Peterhead BayHarbour to service the nearby new power station,and for the possible export of ammonia gas liquids.Expenditure on the Peterhead jetty will be matched by contributions from the prospective users.Options for reductions26.   These would entail the following reductions:  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-821-2	2-4	2-2	2-2It would be	difficult to	sustain cuts	of this order and still ensure that supporting port facilities wouldbe available to meet industrial needs at the timewhen they are required.Shipping servicesImplications of survey figures27. This programme includes the cost of the coast-guard service, marine surveys, measures to combatoil pollution and measures for the maintenance and improvement of standards of safety at sea generally,including aids to navigation and the ChannelNavigation Information Service. Also included isthe United Kingdom subscription to the Inter-national Maritime Consultative Organisation(IMCO) and a number of miscellaneous services.Requirements for maintenance of existing policy28. The forecasts are lower than in Cmnd. 6721,because of the lower than expected rent for thepresent IMCO headquarters and because of reducedPost Office costs; these savings are partly offset bylower forecasts of receipts.Proposals for new developments29. Ministers have recently given policy approval for the building of IMCO&apos;s new headquarters tobe treated as a Crown project. A decision has yet to be taken on the site. Ministers have agreedthat any extra expenditure in connection with this project that might arise in 1977-78 should be a charge on the contingency reserve. Expenditurein later years will broadly be as follows:  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	7-7	6-8	2-1	CIVIL AVIATION SERVICESCivil Aviation Authority grant in aidImplications of survey figures30. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has been set the financial objective of recovering as soon aspossible its costs (including a reasonable return on capital) from those who benefit from its services.Meanwhile the Authority&apos;s deficit on revenue account is being met by a grant in aid.Requirements for maintenance of existing policy31.  The Department of Trade&apos;s present forecastsimply the following changes to the baseline:  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81-0 1	+ 3-0	+0-3The forecasts reflect slower progress than expectedtowards full cost recovery which reflects in turn
decisions reached by euro control in the autumn of1975 about the basis of cost recovery for en routenavigation services. The present forecasts assume that future negotiations on this question will yieldthe result sought by the United Kingdom.Capital investment by the Civil Aviation AuthorityImplication of survey figures32.  This programme is being considered in the separate report to Ministers on the financing andthe investment programmes of the nationalised industries.Requirements for maintenance of existing policy33.  The review of the programme has producedthe following savings:  million1978-791979-801980-81-2-9-20Local authority capital expenditureImplications of survey figures34.  The main project included in the programme is a new terminal complex for Birmingham airport.Requirements for maintenance of existing policies35. This programme has proved very susceptible toshortfall: the local authority forecasts of expendi-ture have therefore been reduced by the Departmentof Trade for realism in particular provision for asecond runway at Manchester airport has been removed. The resulting changes on the baselineare as follows:---		  million1978-79	1979-80	7950-97-11-1	-11	+3-1, o ui a u&amp;* aavmg ui uy mimonis offered, although there is an increase of 3 1 million in 1980-81 due to slippage in the birmingham terminal project. No allowance hasbeen made for any expenditure at local authorityairports which may result from recommendationsagreed in the Airport Policy Review which is dueto be completed later this year.SECRETOther civil aviation servicesImplications of survey figures37. Provision is made for expenditure on aviationsecurity; the United Kingdom&apos;s subscriptions toEurocontrol and to the International Civil AviationOrganisation; grants for airport development;research into aircraft noise; and number of other(minor) services in this country and overseas,including a subsidy from the Scottish Office toLoganair for operating third level air services to the highlands and Islands. The forecasts assume thataviation security expenditure will be recovered fromairport managements as from 1 April 1978.Requirement for maintenance of existing policies38.   There are minor increases on this programme in the three years 1978-79, 1979-80 and 1980-81.OVERALL POSITION OF DEPARTMENT OFTRADE-SHIPPING AND CIVILAVIATION SERVICES39.   The departments forecasts imply the follow-ing overall net changes to the baseline so far as their programme 6 expenditure is concerned:  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81+ 4^4	+ 8-0	+0-3The above figures however exclude local authorities&apos;expenditure on aerodromes which is not under the direct control of the Department of Trade. this programme shows the following changes:  million1978-79                1979-80	1980-81-111                  -1-1	+3-140.   The department have identified	illustrativeoptions as follows:		  million1978-79       1979-80       1980-81	1981-8201             0-5             0-3	0-3
41. These do not meet the required reductions of2\ per cent in 1978-79 and 5 per cent in later years;to compensate for this the department have indenti-fied extra option reductions on their exportpromotion and tourism services in programme 4.OTHER TRANSPORT SERVICESImplications of survey figures42.   This item comprises mainly expenditure oncentral government administration, as well as trans-port   research   and   certain   minor   items.    Bydint of strict economies, policies can be continued at the present reduced level within the surveyprovision.Options for reductions43. The illustrative reductions would be  1 million in 1978-79 and  2-1 million a year thereafter.Reductions in transport administration expenditure could not be achieved without a reduction in thepresent workload, while reductions in provision for transport research would significantly impair thedepartments ability to meet likely demands.

ENGLANDIMPLICATIONS OF THE SURVEY FIGURESSubsidies1- The baseline figures are those in Cmnd. 6721with an agreed reduction of  30 million in 1977-78(announced on 2 May 1977 and transferred to localauthority and housing association spending onimprovements); and a reduction of  27 million in1979-80 and subsequent years (transferred to the&quot; Inner Cities &quot; programme). There have also been- minor adjustments for classification changes.2- The Cmnd. 6721 subsidy forecast was based onthe following main assumptions:(i) a forecast of the local authority pool ratebased on the economic assumptions issued inSeptember 1976;(ii) in accordance with Cabinet decisions inOctober 1976, the average rent increase in1977-78 to be 60p and in 1978-79 80p perweek; thereafter rents were assumed to risein line with the consumer price index.3- A new forecast of local authority and new townhousing revenue accounts (HRAs) has been pre-Pared on the basis of the economic assumptionsfor the 1977 survey and using better information and methodology than was available last autumn.The most important change is in the projection of market interest rates; these are now forecast to be2i per cent lower in 1977-78 and 1^-2 per centlower in 1978-79. Taking into account methodo-logical changes, this brings the forecast pool ratedown by 1 per cent in 1977-78 and 1 - 4 per cent in1978-79, as compared with the pool rates assumedfor Cmnd. 6721. Other smaller but significantchanges are in the estimated cost of debt redemptionand of rent rebates (which are assumed to bemcreased following the recently announced upratingQf social security benefits).4- The new forecast including these changes butPreserving the Cmnd. 6721 rent assumption results in a reduced requirement for subsidies to EnglishPublic sector housing of  122 million in 1977-78and  192 million in 1978-79. One effect of the forecast reduction in costs debited to HRAs wouldhe to make it impossible without legislation in theSECRET1977-78 session to reduce Exchequer housing sub-subsidies in 1978-79 for any but the inner Londonauthorities (and about 50 others, accounting in total for 27 per cent of the local authority housing stock)to make a rent increase of as much as 80p a week in 1978-79 without infringing the &quot; no profit&quot; rule.Most authorities could make only very small rent increases in 1978-79 (half of them less than 30p aweek). If those authorities that could made in-creases of 80p, and the rest as much as they could,the average rent increase for existing tenantswould be 45p.5. The Department of the Environment suggestthat the prospective reductions in housing sub-subsidies call into question the need for an increase of80p in 1978-79. The figure was decided last october against the background of a prospectiveoverspend on housing subsidies of some 450 million (mainly due to forecast rises ininterest rates); and that estimate has now been greatly reduced.6. For the last two surveys it has been accepted that new housing subsidies legislation might be needed, following the conclusion of the housing policy Review, if the rent figures underlyingCmnd. 6721 (and Cmnd. 6393 before that) were tobe met. Legislation is required sooner if housingcosts rise more slowly and in particular if interest rates fall.7. Legislation to be effective in 1978-79 is nowrecognised to be impracticable, and an alternativeapproach it required. In the departments viewlegislation should be introduced in the 1978-79session (i.e. to be effective in 1979-80); andin 1979-80 and thereafter rent increases shouldbe assumed to follow the average earningsindex, rather than the prices index. On this basis the guideline for 1979-80 would beabout 60p (as in 1977-78) and it would be con-sistent with this to go for a 60p rent increase in1978-79 from high cost authorities, while recogni-sing that because of the operation of the no profitrule the national average increase achieved inpractice would be substantially less. On present estimates average rent increases for existing tenantsover the survey period would be as follows (the rent progression underlying Cmnd. 6721 is alsoshown for comparison):57

A substantial saving on the cost of this scheme will arise if building society mortgage interest ratescontinue to fall, and as a consequence of any reduction in the standard rate of income tax.Assuming that the building society rate falls to10 per cent in 1978-79 and 9 per cent in subsequent years, and that the standard rate of tax is reducedto 33 per cent, savings arise as follows:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-824-2	-15	-38	-39	-39LOCAL AUTHORITY INVESTMENT11. The baseline figures are those in Cmnd. 6721,with the 1979-80 figures reduced to a point midwaybetween 1978-79 and 1980-81.12. The figures for land and new dwellings in cmnd. 6721 were those estimated last autumn,following the introduction in July of control overtender acceptances and loan sanctions for landpurchase, as necessary for a programme of 90,000dwellings in tenders accepted for 1977 and 100,000for subsequent calendar years. The expenditureforecast is based critically on assumptions aboutthe phasing of work, and on unit costs of construction.13. Over the last six months tender acceptanceshave fallen well short of the numbers assumed inthe Cmnd. 6721 forecast the cumulative shortfallup to 1 April 1977 amounted to nearly 12,000dwellings. The reasons for this are not clear butfor present purposes it is assumed that this shortfallis made good over the period 1 April 1977 to31 March 1978. The effect is to push forward about
 50 million of expenditure from 1977-78, mostlyinto 1978-79. The most recent evidence on lagsalso has the effect of pushing about  30 million ofexpenditure from 1976-77 into 1977-78 and 1978-79.14. The Cmnd. 6721 forecast assumed some effect in 1978-79 and later years from the adoption of lower standards including a shift towards smallerdwellings mainly for elderly widows and widowers(reflecting the fact that over two-thirds of the net annual increase in households is now in single person households); this followed ministerial decisions in 1975 which were implemented in DOEcircular 24/75. But it now appears that thiscircular is not having the effect hoped for. TheProportion of smaller new local authority dwellingsstarted remains static and this is expected to increasethe cost of the number of approvals programmedby some  20 million a year.15. For these reasons the present approvedexpenditure provision for local authority new house-building is not sufficient for approvals running atthe rate of 100,000 a year.16. The baseline figures would support 100,000approvals from 1 April 1978 onwards if the shortfallQf 12,000 dwellings in 1977-78 (see paragraph 13above) is not in fact made good. Otherwise thefollowing additions would be required:	1977	1978	1979	1980	1981	-78	-79	-80	-81	-82New dwellings    .	.    -5	-1-67	f43	+9	-1l7- For acquisitions the survey figures provide fora gradual return from the low point in 1977-78 toa level of expenditure close to the 1975-76 outturn.The improvements figure for 1977-78 in the base-lne has been increased by  25 million following theannouncement on 2 May. The provision for thefive-year period is now a constant  360 million ayear, that is some 25 per cent below the averageexpenditure over the last five years, though abovethe level achieved in 1976-77, when the totalallocated for improvement spending was underspentby some  40 million.Housing investment programmes18. Under the system of housing investment programmes now being introduced authorities arebeing invited to submit plans for their areas inclu-ding proposals for investment and for other housingcapital expenditure, i.e. improvement grants, lendingfor house purchase and improvement and lendingto housing associations. In the light of thesesubmissions it may be necessary to alter the dis-tribution of the national totals of housing capitalexpenditure under the various survey headings.Furthermore, the system of capital allocations is such that local authorities will be given blockallocations covering several sub-programmes andwill be allowed during the year to switch a limitedproportion of their spending from one block toanother.SALES (NEW TOWNS AND LOCALAUTHORITIES)19. The baseline figures for sales represent theprice of houses and land sold by local authoritiesand new towns. As the majority of council housesales are made by instalments, it is necessary tonet off the associated lending to get the figures of net public expenditure consequential on any levelof sales.20. The baseline figures for sales by localauthorities and new towns net of associated lendingimply net public expenditure as follows: ----									  million1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82-187-5	-97-8	-42-0	-45-3	-64-0	-62-7	-158-1	-154-4	-150-7	-150.721- These figures include provision for sales ofland as well as dwellings. As they stand they imply that from 1978-79 onwards the number of housessold will rise from the 1976-77 level of around6.000 a year to around 20,000 a year; and that theProportion financed by private sources will increase to about 80 per cent from its current level of around25 per cent.22. The department believe this can be achieved.They point out (a) that 20,000 is about half thenumber sold on average each year between 1971and 1973, the last year when there was a vigoroush2
sales drive; (b) that the Governments views expressed in the Housing Policy Green Paper pavethe way for an increase in sales; (c) that building societies have expressed their willingness to play a larger part in the finance of council house sales,and that there is some evidence of moves in thisdirection.23. The Treasury however do not consider it pru-dent to continue to assume such a large increasein net proceeds from sales in 1978-79 and later years. The figures for these years have remained unchanged (apart from revaluations) since the 1975survey. They were based on the assumptionrepeated in the 1976 survey, that following theHousing Policy Review measures would be takento promote sales of council dwellings; or that ifsuch measures were not adopted a corresponding reduction would have to be made in new housinginvestment. It was accepted in the 1976 surveyreport (Part two, 7, paragraph 20) that &quot;with newguidance from the Government the projected levelof receipts in 1976-77 . . . might be achievedthroughout the period. ... To reach the higher level of receipts from sales assumed in later years will require wider initiatives&quot;. But no specificinitiatives are proposed in the Housing PolicyGreen Paper.24. It seems reasonable to suppose that a policyof greater encouragement for sales could lead tosome increase from present levels. Changes in local political control could also be relevant although there is no evidence yet of any marked increase insales following the widespread changes in controlof district councils in May 1976. But 1971-73 arethe only years when sales have ever exceeded 10,000dwellings a year, and there was then a combination of circumstances that is unlikely to recur. A changein policy made it possible to have a short and temporary peak in response to a demand that hadbuilt up over a number of years; and mortgage rates were relatively low, whilst it was announcedGovernment policy to achieve a steady increase incouncil rents. Nevertheless the Treasury would accept that sales might build up to a level ofperhaps 12,000 a year, by 1980-81 (i.e. double thepresent level) and that by that year the proportionprivately financed could rather more than double.The following additions would then be required tothe baseline figures.  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82+ 80	-1-65	4-50	+ 50NEW TOWNS INVESTMENT25. The figures for land and new dwellings in cmnd. 6721 were those estimated last autumn as necessary for a programme of 5,000 dwellings intenders acepted for 1977 and 12,000 for subsequentcalendar years. Since the 1976 survey, the Govern-ment have announced new measures to assist innercities, to be financed partly by a reduction of 2,000approvals in 1978 and subsequent years in the new towns housing programme. Such a reduction isestimated to yield savings of  10 million in 1978-79and  22 million a year in 1979-80 onwards. Thebaseline figures incorporate these reductions, witha subsequent adjustment for 1979-80 as part of the overall adjustment to the housing figures to give asuitable path between 1978-79 and 1980-81.26. A new assessment has been made of theexpenditure required to support 5,000 approvals in1977 and 10,000 a year in 1978 onwards. Increases(and reductions) from the baseline figures in the table would be required as follows:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81+21	-2	4-7	4-5The changes from the previous assessment are due partly to recent evidence that unit costs in relationto costs of other public sector housing are higherthan previously estimated, and partly to the expectation-tation that the time between starts and completionswill shorten. There is no offsetting action that canbe taken within new towns housing investment todeal with the excess in 1977-78.HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS27. The baseline figures are those in Cmnd. 6721with the 1979-80 figure reduced to the mid-pointbetween 1978-79 and 1980-81. The figures for1977-78 and 1978-79 reflect the decisions made inthe 1976 survey to reduce the housing corporationprogramme, and to seek private sector finance soas to secure a substantial contribution to the cutsmade in July and December.
28- The reduced programme of approvals to whichthe housing corporation are now working is asfollows:1977-7819781979Number of units in schemes approvedNew building Rehabilitation15,725 11,22016,650 11,88018,500 13,20029. The private sector finance so far secured is oftwo types; (a) temporary finance from the clearing banks direct to housing associations on overdraftterms (b) syndicated loans from the banking sectorprovided to a company in which the housing corporation have a minority interest, and on-lent to housing associations.30. Taken together with the private finance nowalmost certain to be made available in 1977-78 and1978-79, and assumed to continue to be availableover the survey period, the baseline figures are less than thought to be required in the early years to support this number of approvals, but more thansufficient in later years. The figures are as follows:  millionChange from baseline:Gross expenditure on corporation-sponsored programmeless:(a) temporary bank finance(b) syndicated loans       ....Net change in public expenditure on corporation schemesChange in public expenditure on local authority-sponsoredschemes    ........Total.......1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82+61	H-93	+ 17	-51	-4020	10	_		22	20	-	-	-+ 19	-f63	+ 17	-51	-40-5	-23	-31	-22	-22+ 14	+40	-14	-73	-62Local authority mortgage lending and repayments31- The baseline figures for gross lending reflect the very large reductions made during the 1976survey-these averaged  275 million a year (1976survey prices) in the four years from 1977-78 to1980-81. The provision of  120 million a year(1977 survey prices) from 1978-79 onwards com-Pares with an annual average expenditure of 427 million in the five years 1972-73 to 1976-77.However lending had already declined by 1976-77to an estimated  172 million.32. For 1977-78 the building societies have agreedto lend  145 million in England to applicantsreferred to them by local authorities under the&quot; replacement lending &quot; scheme. Applicants mustsatisfy the societies&apos; normal criteria of credit-worthiness; for this reason despite evidence ofmcreased willingness by the societies to lend onolder property there will continue to be many whowould have received a local authority mortgage inPast years, but will not now be able to obtain a mortgage from either a local authority or a building society.33. The figures estimated for repayments of localauthority mortgages were slightly reduced duringthe 1976 survey, but the reductions did not gonearly far enough to reflect the very large reductionin gross lending. Repayments are critically affectedby the number of mortgages repaid prematurely.Total repayments are now estimated to fall short of the figures in the table as follows:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82+31	4-44	4-46	H-66	-f-75SAVINGS AND ADDITIONALREQUIREMENTS34.

The department also draw attention to thefollowing prospective new developments:(a) savings bonus and loans schemes: ministers have agreed that the idea of savings bonusand loans schemes to help first-time purchasersshould be included in the Housing PolicyGreen Paper, subject to the cost being met from within the approved totals for housing.The savings bonus would be equivalent total paid at the basic rate in respect of interest,on savings of up to  1,000. The loan wouldbe of  500, interest-free for five years, avail-able to people who had saved  500 over atleast two years, and who buy a cheaper home.The loan would be repaid, beginning after five years, and with subsequent interest overthe remaining life of the mortgage.(b) The first results from the house conditionsurvey 1976 show progress in slum clearanceand   improvement   of   dwellings   lacking1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82-122	-192	-219	-208	-169+30	-	4-27	4-27	4-27-92	-192	-192	-181	-142_	4-73	4-55	4-38	+ 177	-10	-10	-10	-10-t-2	-15	-38	-39	-39+31	4-44	4-46	4-66	4-75-66	-100	-139	-126	-99-	4-80	4-65	4-50	4-50-66	-20	-74	-76	-49-5	4-67	4-43	4-9	-1+21	-2	4-7	4-5	4-5+ 14	4-40	-14	-73	-624-30	4-105	4-36	-59	-58amenities but an increase in dwellings requir-ing substantial repairs over 900,000 costingmore than  2,350 each to put right.

Theopportunity should be taken to make moreprovision for rehabilitation.(c) There may be pressure to increase the alloca-tions available to local authorities for private sector improvement grants for 1979-80 and fol-lowing years to provide for extra improvementwork following an up-swing in the economy-(d) The opportunity should be taken to makeadditional provision for mortgage lending.36.

37. The total of the prospective savings, increasedrequirements including the Treasury estimate of sales, and new developments set out in paragraphs34 to 36 is:  million1977-78      1978-79     1979-80     1980-81      1981-824-904-654-50+50It would be technically feasible to offset the increasein 1978-79 by reductions in the amounts availablefor local authority investment. If tender approvalsdo not pick up over the rest of the year this willindeed be achieved automatically. For later years the increase could be met by foregoing some ofthe new developments set out in paragraph 35.The department do not accept that increased pro-vision is required for a shortfall in sales; on theirbasis there is no net increase or reduction in any year, except in 1978-79. The total change would therefore be:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82-	4-10	-	-	-38. These figures show the net increase in housingtotals after taking credit for reductions in public sector subsidies (arising mainly from new interestrate assumptions) averaging about  200 million ayear. These are offset by estimating increases inother items, increases required to cater for previouslyPlanned numbers of approvals for new dwellings(but with fewer smaller houses), and proposed new developments.39- The Treasury&apos;s view is that it is for considera-tion to what extent the savings revealed by the newforecast of subsidies should be available to financeother housing expenditure. In October last yearMinisters took decisions about how to deal with anoverspend in English housing subsidies of some 450 million (1976 survey prices) a year then in prospect from 1978-79 onwards, mainly due to forecast rises in interest rates. Cabinet decided thatsome  280 million each year should be met fromlhe housing programme (higher rents, and cuts inmortgage lending and investment); and  170 million a year was met by reductions in other programmes.4o- The additional requirements and new develop-ments set out above include proposed furtherencouragement to private sector housing investment and a net increase in public sector housing invest-ment of around  100 million in 1978-79 and1979-80. In considering the results of the housing policy Review a small majority of Ministers inGEN 65 took the view that it would on the contrarybe right to look in future for a modest reductionin the level of housing investment, although therewas a consensus against making any such commit-ment in the Housing Green Paper.41. In the Treasury&apos;s view there is no case for increasing the provision for future housing invest-ment. They draw attention to the following points:(a) There is no longer a gross housing shortage,but a growing crude surplus of houses overhouseholds. Unsatisfactory housing condi-tions persist in many areas and continuedinvestment in new building and improvementwork in both public and private sector housingis required to deal with them as well as toprovide for the projected increase in thenumber of separate households. But it wouldbe possible to maintain a significant rate of progress in improving conditions with a lowertotal of public and private resources.(b) The Green Paper proposes a shift of emphasistowards owner occupation, and that should further reduce the need for investment in thepublic sector. Moreover the new savingsbonus and loans scheme for first-time pur-chasers was approved on condition that itscost was met within agreed public expenditureon housing.(c) The Green Paper emphasises that future levels of investment, and their distribution betweennew building, improvements, acquisitions andlending, must be determined in the light ofneeds identified by local authorities in their housing investment programmes. So it iswrong to imply that there are &quot; present policies&quot; e.g. to approve 100,000 new localauthority houses a year, from 1978 onwards.(d) A &quot; projection of present trends &quot; carried out during the Housing Policy Review, andincorporating less than 100,000 new localauthority dwellings a year, threw up an im-plausibly large increase in the total numberof vacant dwellings (rising to 1  million by1986).
42.  In the departments view, the above threeparagraphs give an incomplete picture of the truenature of the housing situation and of Ministers&apos;decisions in connection with public expenditure on housing as recorded in GEN 65 discussions.  Somesurplus of dwellings is necessary to allow forvacancies inevitably required in the working of a housing market on account of such factors as movesbetween houses and houses standing empty under repair or conversion; the crude surplus figure con-ceals the fact that a substantial number of dwellingsare second homes.   A better indication of thehousing situation comes from a look at the netdeficit of decent housing after taking account of households in slums, sub-standard housing, over-crowded  housing  and  sharing  involuntarily  indifficult circumstances.   On this basis there areat least two million households in England andWales in very bad and unsatisfactory conditions,and others who, although housed in less bad con-ditions, are living in circumstances which shouldbe improved.   These national figures however donot reveal the amount of disrepair in the housingstock, nor differences in conditions between areas,nor the suitability of the housing stock in house-holds in particular areas.43.   The department contend that:(a) Ministers agreed in GEN 65 by a clear con-sensus that there should be no commitment in the Green Paper on the Housing policy review to reduce the level of investment in housing the Lord Chancellor (in his capacity as Chairman of GEN 65) recorded in his note to the Cabinet that the proposals involved no commitment on the future level of housinginvestment, except to say that we still need asubstantial level of investment in both thepublic and the private sectors to help withthe backlog of poor housing conditions and special needs and to provide for future house-holds: and that the level of investment mustbe determined in the light of the needsidentified in the local authorities&apos; housinginvestment programmes;(b) in the light of the changed interest rateassumptions(i) adjustments should be made to accom-accommodate the changed requirements tomaintain existing policies, and(ii) part of the cuts made last autumn in thehousing capital programme are no longer required and the programme should be restored so far as possible without adding to overall public expenditure on housing;and(c) there is ample evidence of bad housing con-ditions to justify expenditure on the new developments as proposed in the Green paper and those described in paragraph 35.OPTIONS FOR REDUCTIONS44.  The survey rules require illustrative optionsto be shown giving the following minimum savings in the English programme:  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-8298-2	204-4	211-3	211-345. These amounts are all well within the margin of error of estimates for the total housing pro-gramme. But if the savings were to be sought as amatter of policy, the following are technicalpossibilities:(a) Subsidies. The only major determinant of subsidies which Ministers can hope to in-fluence effectively is the average increase inrents from year to year. On the assumptionthat legislation is obtained to be effective in1979-80, the average rent increases obtained for this and later years could be higher thanthe simple &quot; with earnings &quot; formula from thatyear onwards suggested in paragraph 7 above.For example, a rent increase 5 per cent aboveearnings in 1979-80 and 1980-81 (whichwould be required to achieve an average rentrise broadly in line with earnings over theperiod from 1974-75) would yield savings of 40 million in 1979-80 and  90 million in subsequent years. This would mean rent increases for existing tenants, in place of those set out in paragraph 7 above, as follows:Pence per week1979-80	1980-81	1981-824-78	+90	4-75(b) Local authority capital expenditure. Althoughmuch of the expenditure in 1978-79 is already committed, savings of 2\ per cent in that year.
and 5 per cent in later years would be feasible.The amounts allocated under housing invest-ment programmes could be reduced by thesepercentages to give roundly, savings of 50 million in 1978-79 and  100 million in subsequent years;(c) Housing associations and new towns. Cuts inthese programmes of similar severity mightbe made to yield  15 million in 1978-79 and 30 million in 1979-80 and subsequent years.An additional  35 million in 1978-79 and 1979-80would be needed to meet the full savings required.These might be met by an additional cut in localauthority capital expenditure. Drawing the above figures together produces the following table ofoptions:Summary of options, England  million1978 1979 1980 1981-79     -80     -81      -82Subsidies (extra rent increase) . -Local  authority   capital  ex-Penditure .... 85Housing associations and new towns      ....       15401353090100309010030Total10020522022046. The precise effect of cuts in capital expendi-ture programmes depends on where they are concentrated. But, for illustration, if all the cutswere applied to new building programmes, a re-duction of about 12,000 approvals a year isrequired starting in 1977 and continuing over thePeriod. If the extra rent increase were not judgedPracticable the shortfall could be made good by further reductions in capital expenditure pro-grammes.SCOTLAND^PLICATIONS OF THE SURVEY FIGURESSUBSIDIES47- A new forecast of local authority and newtown HRA expenditure has been carried outfollowing the changed economic assumptions andmethodology. The result is to throw up prospectivereductions on Cmnd. 6721 rent assumptions asfollows:SECRET  million7977-75    1978-79    1979-80    1980-81    1981-82-31-6-53-5-63-8-63-8-59-8The reductions result in part from the lower pro-jection of interest rates, and in part from takingfull account of the impact on subsidies of reductions in capital investment agreed in the course of the1976 survey.48. If Ministers agreed to the revised rent approachfor England proposed in paragraph 7 above theScottish Office would also propose a revisedapproach for Scotland, assuming rent increases tofollow the earnings index from 1978-79 withaverage rent increases as follows:outturn prices	1977	1978	1979	1980	1981	-78	-79	-80	-81	-82Cmnd. 6721:					Pence a week .	+50	+70	4-38	4-42	4-46Per cent	14-4	17-5	8	8	8Revised progression:					Pence a week .	4-50	4-40	4-44	4-48	4-52Per cent	14-4	10	10	10	1049.

The baseline figures for local authority newdwellings are those in Cmnd. 6721 for all yearsexcept 1979-80. The Scottish Office chose to take in this sub-programme the entire reduction requiredin their programme to give a suitable path between1978-79 and 1980-81. (There is moreover a difference of view between the Treasury and theScottish Office about the appropriate size of thisadjustment. The path in the baseline is calculated in the same way as for England and Wales, andrepresents the arithmetical mid-point between1978-79 and 1980-81 figures for the aggregate of most items of housing expenditure other than sub-subsidies.   The Scottish Office claim that equity of65
treatment with England would require reductions in1979-80 in the same proportions as departments&apos;shares of the December 1976 cuts. This would have produced a reduction of  16-4 million for Scotland;and have given a total for Scottish housing 10-2 million higher than the baseline figure for1978-79.)51. Increases are required to meet the level oftender approvals that emerged from the 1976 survey of 7,500 units in 1977, and 11,500 a year thereafter.Apart from the figure for 1979-80, where theincrease would also offset the mid-point adjustment,these are needed to take account of the failure, asin England, to achieve smaller house sizes, andeconomies; a substantial increase in the unit costhas occurred instead. The bids are set out inparagraph 55 below.52. The baseline figures would be sufficient for a programme of tender approvals as follows:Numbers of dwellings1977	1978	1979	1980	19815,500	8,000	9,000	10,000	10,50053. The baseline figures also provide for a pro-gramme of approvals for new town dwellings of:1977	1978	1979	1980	19812,750	2,250	2,750	2,750	2,750and 3,250 approvals a year for Scottish special housing association new dwellings.54. For housing associations the Cmnd. 6721figures were based on a programme of approvalsof:	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81New building	2,200	2,200	2,400	2,400Rehabilitation  .	3,200	3,200	3,200	3,200A re-estimation	of the	cost of	this programme	suggests that either the rate of approvals will haveto be cut by about a fifth, or increased provision is needed as set out in paragraph 55 below.SAVINGS AND ADDITIONALREQUIREMENTS55.

The Scottish Office also propose, in additionto provision required for the new savings bonusand loans schemes, the following additional bids:(a) an increase in spending on improvements tolocal authority housing to provide for anannual level of expenditure on modernisa-tion and rehabilitation of  70 million a year from 1978-79 onwards;(b) a  10 million a year increase in localauthority mortgage lending, from the presentprovision of  14-2 million, to permit furtherlending on properties that the building societies find difficult;
(c) a substantial increase in rehabilitation activityby the Scottish special housing association(SSHA) in inner Glasgow, partly offset by areduction in the association^ new building pro-gramme to the following level of approvals:1977	1978	1979	1980	19812,400	2,500	2,500	2,500	2,50057.

These figures show the net change after takingcredit for subsidy savings of  30 million  60 million a year arising mainly from lower interest rates;and proposed increases in housing investment andmortgage lending of up to  40 million- 60 million a year.   As for England, in the Treasury&apos;s view itis for consideration to what extent the subsidysavings should be available to finance such increasedhousing investment, although the Scottish Office didoffset their excess on housing subsidies last autumnwithin the housing totals.   In Scotland the surplusof houses over households is proportionately larger than south of the border, and the trend to owner occupation from a much lower starting point isexpected to be relatively stronger.  In that contextsome increase in funds available for mortgage lend-ing makes sense; but to continue to plan to startover 17,000 public sector new dwellings (excludinghousing associations) each year does not.   an assessment carried out by Scottish DevelopmentDepartment (and published in the Scottish HousingGreen Paper), based on a variety of assumptions about growth of numbers of households, owner occupation and vacancy rates, suggested that on thebasis of present trends a programme of about half that level should be sufficient.  Whilst the ScottishOPTIONS FOR REDUCTIONS60. The survey guidelines require illustrativeoptions to be identified to give the following savings in the Scottish programme:  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-8215-2	32-1	33-5	33-5Reductions of this order from 1980-81 onwardswould require the level of approvals for new public sector dwellings and housing associations to bereduced by 3,000 a year from 1978. It would nowbe difficult to restrict approvals in 1977 below thelevel of 5,500 required, as indicated in paragraph 52above, to hold expenditure on new dwellings to thebaseline figures. To achieve cuts in the earlier years, therefore, there would also have to be sub-stantial reductions in local authority and SSHAimprovement investment, and probably also in localauthority mortgage lending. Alternatively someof the shortfall might be made up by higher rent increases in 1978-79 and 1979-80 than proposedin paragraph 48, but this could not be guaranteedwithout legislation.SECRET67
WALESIMPLICATIONS OF THE SURVEY FIGURESSUBSIDIES61. The baseline figures are those in Cmnd. 6721with an agreed reduction of  2-5 million in 1977-78(transferred to mortgage lending and improvements).A new forecast of subsidies based on the surveyeconomic assumptions and new methodology showsreductions in all years for the same reasons as inEngland and Scotland. A very approximateestimate has also been made of the effects on Welshsubsidies of lower increases in rents as proposed inparagraph 7. These are shown in the table follow-ing paragraph 64 below, together with estimatedchanges in rent rebates and allowances (which areassumed to be increased following the recently announced uprating of social security benefits).Using the same assumptions as in England savingsalso arise on the option mortgage scheme.LOCAL AUTHORITY INVESTMENT ANDSALES62. The present provision is sufficient to accom-accommodate approvals of between 4,500 and 5,000 newdwellings a year; improvement works to some 2,000local authority dwellings a year; and improvement grants for some 8,000 properties a year. The welsh office believe that the forecast of proceeds fromcouncil house sales is unlikely to be realised (forthe reasons set out in paragraphs 23 and 24 above)and that extra provision of  5 1 million a year isrequired on that account. In addition, mortgagerepayments are now estimated to fall short of thebaseline figures.HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS/NEW TOWNS63. The baseline figures provide for a level ofapprovals for around 1,000 housing associationnew dwellings a year; 500 rehabilitation approvals;and about 200 new dwellings a year in CwmbranNew Town.SAVINGS AND ADDITIONALREQUIREMENTS64.

The Welsh Office consider that these savingsshould be applied to raise the Welsh housing pro-gramme nearer the levels of earlier years and that further additions are also required. The presentprovision for local authority housing investment(taking account of lending and sales) averages 79 million a year over the survey period comparedwith an average of  135 million over the last threeyears. Details of further provisions sought are asfollows:(a) local authority investment. The Secretaryof State for Wales believes there is a con-tinuing backlog of need for new local authority housing in Wales, and for the improvement of older property in both the public and private sector; and that, although there has been somenet decline in local authority activity rates inthe last two to three years, Welsh localauthorities are capable of sustaining a pro-gramme of at least 1976 proportions. he believes that the provision should be increasedto enable local authorities to reach a target of 8,000 new dwellings a year by 1981-82.(b) mortgage lending. Additional provision is sought in 1977-78 together with a smoothertransition to the more adequate level in1980-81.(c) slum clearance. Increased provision isproposed.

The Welsh Officebelieve that housing conditions in Wales justify anincrease. 44-5 per cent of the stock was builtbefore 1919 compared with 32-1 per cent inEngland.67- The Treasury point out that it is for con-sideration to what extent the subsidy savings shouldbe available for housing. As in England subsidyoverspends in prospect last autumn were offsetPartly by reductions in other programmes, including a  5 million (1976 survey prices) reduction inother Welsh programmes. The Treasury do not inany event believe that any net increase is justified:7.  Housing(a) in the course of the 1976 survey an increaseof  20 million (1976 survey prices) a year was agreed for Welsh housing from the contingency reserve;(b) in 1976-77 Welsh local authorities&apos; housinginvestment including improvement grants fellsome  22 million short of the  134 millionthat was available;(c) the comments in paragraph 41 above apply equally to public sector housing investment in wales;(d) the principal housing problem in Wales towhich the Welsh Office draw attention is theage and fitness of their housing stock. 96 percent of unfit houses in Wales are in theprivate sector; whereas the proposed increases in expenditure are designed to raise the rateof public sector new building, and of im-improvements to public sector dwellings.OPTIONS FOR REDUCTIONS68.

Since their establishment in 1974 the regionalwater authorities (RWAs) in England and the welsh National Water Development authority have been reviewing the capital expenditure pro-grammes they inherited and preparing to producemedium term plans which they will be required tosubmit annually to the Government in an agreedformat. The first such plans have recently beenreceived and are still under discussion with thewater authorities.2. As the table below shows, the aggregate ofthese plans (including adjustments made in the lightof consultation so far) falls substantially short ofthe survey baseline figures for the last three yearsof the period.  million	1977	1978	1979	1980	1981	-78	-79	-80	-81	-82Survey base line					RWAs	438-0	399-9	470-7	541-5	541-5WNWDA   .	45-7	45-6	49-7	53-8	53-8Authorities&apos; present					plans					RWAs	431-3	398-9	424-7	426-6	430-1WNWDA   .	41-6	45-3	48-3	49-1	50-23. The plans clearly reflect the Governmenfsdeclared priorities for the provision of services tomeet urgent public health needs, for new housing and for industrial development. It is less clearhow far the plans provide for other work.4. For example they make no provision for com-compliance with the e.c. directive on bathing water.They appear to make little or no allowance for implementation of the Control of Pollution Act,1974 and continuing the policy for provision off first time rural sewerage schemes. Some provision is made for the replacement of worn out pipes and sewers, but the basis of planning for this work is uncertain. Where the immediate priorities do notapply it may not be practicable even to maintainpresent standards of water and sewerage services-The authorities are statutorily required to maintain and improve the quality of their rivers but theirpresent plans may imply some deterioration iDquality. The potential for additional expenditureon these categories of work is very large indeed-5. In the view of the Department of the environment the conservatism of the authoritiesexpenditure plans has been largely influenced bythe effect of the high cost of borrowing on the levelof charges.  Despite that effect, it does not appe^
to the department that the urgent need for additional expenditure referred to in paragraph 4should be neglected for the remainder of the survey period.6- The Treasury point out that the plans sub-mitted by the RWAs represent the most informedassessment available of the costs of providing the basic requirements for these services as establishedduring the 1975 survey. The Treasury considerthat the plans show a proper, but not an undue,concern over the impact of the costs of new invest-ment on charges. They note also from theauthorities&apos; assessment of the purpose of theirPlanned investment up to 1981-82 that 20-25 percent would be on improvements in the level ofservice although the department have argued thatthose are largely incidental to expenditure to meetthe immediate priorities. The Treasury thereforebelieve that, unless Ministers wish to go beyond their declared priorities for these services, the aggre-gate figures in the plans represent a valid reducedrequirement.British Waterways Board7- The British Waterways Board receives grants which enable it to meet its deficit on revenue account and to bring up to modern traffic standardsroad bridges over its waterways (Bridgeguard).The Board&apos;s future is under consideration in the context of the review of the water industry.8- A consulting engineers report has shown thatthe level of financing made available to the board is inadequate to meet its statutory obligations forthe present network under the Transport Act, 1968.An exceptional increase in grant, offset from otherwater industry programmes, has been made for1977-78 for particularly urgent items of work.Scotland9- Provision is included for capital and current expenditure by regional and islands councils inScotland on water supply and the disposal and^eatment of sewage to match domestic andlndustrial requirements, and for expenditure byrrver purification boards.CapitalProvision continues to be sufficient only to accommodate projects essential for the servicing ofSECRETnew housing and industry or to avoid serious publichealth risks. The provision for 1977-78 and1978-79 was reduced as part of the cuts announced in December 1976 and a consequent reduction hasbeen made in the survey baseline figure for1979-80. The reduced provision for these years will be insufficient to enable desirable and in-increasingly urgent schemes to improve or preserve the quality of the environment to proceed. In the later years it will become more difficult to maintainstandards and the need to accommodate important new water supply and sewage treatment schemes which have so far been deferred will become morepressing. The Scottish Office consider that thefollowing additional bid is required to make adequate provision for longer-term needs at theend of the survey period and to allow a very limited improvement of effluent standards.Additional bids  million1978-79	1979-80   1980-81	1981-82Water services in		Scotland      	1-0	2-0Current11. Provision now includes support by contri-butions from general rates for the cost of watersupply which were not hitherto included. Thepresent baseline would require local authorities to contain current expenditure to the level assumed in the rate support grant settlement for 1977-78.For water supply this should be practicable if thelocal authorities maintain realistic levels of metercharges and domestic water rate poundages. Forsewerage, present provision is below the level ofactual spending and although the local authoritiescan be expected to make some efforts to contain the revenue consequences of the continuing capital programme, the Scottish Office consider the follow-ing additional bid, which includes  0-2 million tocover the extra costs of the Health and Safety atWork etc. Act, 1974 from 1979-80, is required toestablish a realistic profile:Additional bid  million	1977 -78	1978 -79	7979 -80	1980 -81	1981 -82Sewerage and sewage treatment in Scot-land		3-0	3-2	3-2	3-273k

It is expected that capital expenditure onthe Thames tidal flood protection scheme andon other arterial drainage will be containedwithin the survey figures, as follows:  million1977 1978-78     -791979-801980-811981-82Survey figuresThames tidal scheme:Regional water authorities  49-9    39-4    29-5    16 0    16-0Local authorities    .   49-8    35-3    44-2    32 0    30-other arterial drainage:Capital:Regional water authorities   30-4    29-6    29-4    29-8    28-local authorities      8 0     7-6     6-9     6-9      6-6138-1   111-9   1100    84-7    81-3Reduced requirements for the maintenanceof existing plannedstandards:Capital:Regional water authorities -7-3   -20   -2-9   -2-9     -Local authorities    -6-3   +0-5   -1-2-2   +1-5     -124-5   110-4   109-3    83-3    81-313. The reduced requirements in 1977-78include about  9 million for the Thames tidalscheme due to slower progress than forecast in cmnd. 6721.LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES14. These services include refuse collection and disposal; the provision of parks and recreational facilities; the provision of municipal offices andadministrative services; activities under the Townand Country Planning Acts; and a miscellany ofother services. The forecast of local authoritycurrent expenditure is subject to consultationwith the Consultative Council on Local Govern-ment Finance and the Convention of scottish local Authorities in the course of the annual rate support grant negotiations.england and walesCurrent15. The 1978-79 provision is 4 per cent (Le.some  45 million) lower than the provision for1977-78. The rate support grant (RSG) settlement for that year was in turn 2\ per cent below the expected outturn for 1976-77. It implied an allround reduction in the standard of services pro-vided and further economies in the use of staff.Savings were sought, in particular, throughincreased charges and reduced activity in existingrecreation facilities and deferment of opening ofnew areas; and reduction in the level of activity and in the number of staff engaged in administration and town and country planning. The settlementrecognised that a significant reduction in the levelof spending on refuse collection and disposal andon environmental health could not be achieved without a risk to public health. It also assumed that charges would be made for all services where-ever possible and that consideration would begiven to widening the scope of charges from1977-78 onwards.16. While authorities should be able to reduce their expenditure in 1978-79 to the Cmnd. 6721level, this will require a very real and sustainedeffort on their part. The difficulties of keepingexpenditure to these reduced levels are compoundedby additional costs arising from changes in thenumber and pattern of distribution of dwellingsand by the ongoing consequences of recent capital projects ( 21 million in 1978-79, and an additional 17-5 million,  16 million and  14 million in1979-80, 1980-81 and 1981-82 respectively).Additional provision of  2-5 million will be needed for 1979-80 to cover the cost of implementing theregulations and safety representatives and safetycommittees under the Health and Safety at Worketc. Act, 1974.17. In considering the scope for further reductionsit has to be remembered that this expenditure is not within the Governments control and that theservices concerned are subject to considerable localpressures. Savings in town and country planning(requiring compulsory redundancies of staff) couldjeopardise the development planning councils mustby statute undertake. The scope for further increases in real terms in charges is limited by   local   authority   attitudes   and   consumer
resistance. The only service on which signifi-cant savings might be sought is recreation.An intensification of the measures suggested for1977-78 of increasing charges, cutting openinghours, and cutting maintenance could make somesavings. But local authorities may well be un-willing to reduce standards much further than theyhave done in 1977-78. On the other hand thedesire to avoid substantial rate increases may provide a powerful incentive. Authorities may therefore manage to make substantial reductions in their total expenditure even though optionsmay be difficult to identify centrally. It must be assumed that some of these reductions willfeed through into local environmental servicesexpenditure.18. It follows that it is possible to take two different views about local authority expenditureQn local environmental services in 1978-79 and later years. The Treasury do not consider thatthere are strong grounds for assuming that localauthorities cannot be persuaded to hold their expenditure at the reduced 1978-79 level. TheDepartment of the Environment, however, believethat the pressures on local authorities not to letservices drop below current levels will be such that additional provision will be required in1979-80 and beyond to reflect what authorities will actually spend. The department thereforemake the following additional bid:  million1978-79     1979-80     1980-81      1981-82153045There is a requirement by the Department ofPrices and Consumer Protection for additional expenditure of  1 million in each of the years1978-79 to 1981-82 in connection with new regula-tions to be made under the Consumer Credit Act,l974 and the expected demands for advice. Thedepartment have not offered offsetting savings.scotlandCurrentIn recent RSG settlements, this programme^as been used to some extent as a regulator tor&apos;ng aggregate local authority spending downto the level of spending acceptable to the^0vernment, by setting survey and RSG provisionat a level substantially lower than that shownSECRETin authorities&apos; outturn and budget returns. Thelatest local authority budget estimates for 1977-78show that planned spending on these servicescontinues to be well in excess of provisiondespite local authorities&apos; evident efforts to contain the increase. However in real terms the levelof planned spending is less than that originallyplanned for 1976-77. Although continued efforts to achieve savings may be made, these will notbe sufficient to do more than offset increased expenditure arising from population movement,additional responsibilities under domestic andEEC legislation and the revenue effects of bringing new capital facilities into use.Additional bid21. The following additional bid, including 0-4 million for extra costs of the Health and safety at Work etc. Act, 1974 requirements from1979-80, is required on the assumption that localauthorities will contain expenditure at the levelplanned for 1977-78	in the	later survey	years :			  million1977-78     1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-827-6	8-3	8-3	8-3england and walesCapital22. Most of the services in England and Walesfall within the locally determined sector arrange -ments for controlling capital expenditure whichallow for a block borrowing approval to localauthorities. Within their block allocation theyare free to spend at their own discretion togetherwith funds from revenue or capital receipts. the sector covers a wide variety of programmes and it is not possible to forecast exactly how muchwill be spent on particular services. In the past,capital expenditure by local authorities on localenvironmental services has exceeded forecasts, butthis has been balanced by underspending on other services.Implications of the survey figures23.  The present provision, which reflects a trans-fer of  9 million from 1979-80 onwards to the urban programme represents greatly reduced levels of expenditure in comparison with recent years, i.e.75K2
  million1974-75     1975-76     1976-77     1977-78     1978-79     1979-80     1980-81440-2        418-2        288-4        137-3 128-4        142-128-3 30-9 14-9 10-6 11-8 12-5EnglandWalesWithin the locally determined sector the cumulative effect of these reductions will be to compel localauthorities to concentrate their resources on already committed projects and other unavoidable itemssuch as the replacement of refuse collection and disposal facilities which are essential on publichealth grounds. After allowing for expenditurecommitted on projects started or contracted during1977-78 and for planned replacement of equipmenta rough approximation of the 1977 survey figuresfor the locally determined sector which can beregarded as uncommitted in England and Walesare: for 1978-79 about 34 per cent (some 48 million) for 1979-80 about 65 per cent (some 100 million), for 1980-81 about 80 per cent (some 140 million); the higher proportions of uncom-mitted expenditure in the later years being con-tingent on a complete standstill on new capital projects after 1977-78.24. The particularly low provisions for 1977-78and 1978-79 will require the deferment of urgentexpenditure, with consequent additional pressure on resources for subsequent years. It is doubtfulwhether any services will escape a lowering of standards. Among the more vulnerable activities are the provision and improvement of parks and recreational facilities which are important for new housing areas as well as in many of the older urban areas, and the provision and servicing of industrialestates, which could have implications for the government&apos;s industrial and employment policies.The forced retention of inefficient or uneconomicequipment and facilities can lead to higher levels of current expenditure. At best, the Cmnd. 6721 pro-vision can only increase the difficulty for authorities of providing an acceptable level of services and administration but a continued lack of capital for replacement and renewals over the full forecastperiod could lead to serious difficulties in some services.25. In the derelict land key sector, 100 per centgrants in assisted and derelict land clearance areas were introduced in December 1975, and it was announced that reclamation in England would beincreased to match the programme proposed forScotland and Wales. The English programme was, unlike those in Scotland and Wales, caught bythe December 1976 moratorium and suffered a 2 million reduction in 1977-78. Any further reduction would be seen as a repudiation of the december 1975 announcement. The incidence ofcoast protection work is unpredictable as it tends to be determined by the effects of the sea andweather rather than by long-term planning. TheCmnd. 6721 provision is already on the low side and there can be no guarantee that this would be adequate if much major work had to be carried out.scotlandCapital26. In Scotland, local authority capital expenditure for these services is now included in a &quot; generalservices &quot; block allocation as part of a new systemof financial planning. Local authorities are nowfree to determine their own priorities within the block allocations which were given for the first timein 1977-78. After the December 1976 cutsprovision is well below the level of expenditureplanned by the local authorities for 1977-78 and1978-79 spending proposed by the local authoritiesexceeded available provision by approximately40 per cent. There will be a severely curtailedmargin for new starts in 1977-78 and a further cut-back of overall provision in 1978-79. There is strong pressure for additional expenditure orlessential replacements particularly of vehicles,plant and tipping facilities for refuse collection and disposal. Overall, provision may be sufficient to accommodate essential needs at the absolute mini&apos;mum but only by imposing a continued severeconstraint on other less essential services, such asadministrative buildings, factory buildings andadvances to industrialists. There will be much reduced scope for recreational and town planningprojects.76secr t
Additional bid27. The Scottish Office have submitted the follow-ing additional bid to relieve the backlog of demand in later years.level projected for 1978-79 in Cmnd. 6721 (resulting in a very restricted rate of new commitments duringthe rest of the survey period) the following sumswould be available for additional bid offsets and /or					  million	policy options:			  million	1977 -78	1978 -79	1979 -80	1980 -81	1981 -82										1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82General services.	-    -	-	-	10	2 0	30	40	75	75Offsetting savings and options for reductionsEOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATERSERVICESengland and wales28. Bearing in mind the circumstances described in paragraph 17 above, which give rise to theadditional bid for current expenditure on localenvironmental services, it would be unrealistic tomake further reductions, even for illustrative pur-Poses, to the Cmnd. 6721 current expenditure figures.29. In the Treasury&apos;s view it is therefore necessaryto look to the capital expenditure within the localenvironmental and water programme to offset theadditional bid, and to provide the policy options,which are as follows:  million	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82Additional bids Policy options .	41	15 86	30 91	45 9130- Reductions in the water programme within the margin between the present survey provision andthe aggregate of the authorities&apos; plans amount in total to:  million1978-79     1979-80     1980-81      1981-8247120115E In the Treasury&apos;s view, these reductions should^e applied in full to offset the additional bid and tonelp provide the sums necessary for the policy0Ptions. In addition, if the local environmental services capital programme for the years in question were to be cut back to about 80 per cent of the32. The above reductions in provision for waterservices and local environmental services capital would be more than sufficient to offset all theadditional bids.33. In the departments view the severity of the cutsmade to arrive at the Cmnd. 6721 figures makes itunrealistic to consider any further reduction in localenvironmental services capital during the forecastperiod. In particular the much reduced provisions for 1977-78 and 1978-79 will require the defermentof many essential projects for new schemes and the replacement of outworn facilities which will leadto additional pressure on resources for the later years. The wide range of activities within localenvironmental services and the flexibility of thelocally determined sector, which permits local auth-orities to switch provisions between services withinthe sector, enabled local authorities to absorb the30 per cent cut between 1975-76 and 1976-77, butthe December 1976 cuts have already reduced theprovision for these services to the minimum toler-able level and, in the departments view, there isnow no margin for option reductions.34. On water services, the departments view isthat there is no scope for a further reduction in theprovision for 1978-79. As regards subsequent years it is impossible to say, in view of what has gone before, that it is impracticable to make the5 per cent option reductions although, particularly as regards 1979-80, this would mean an undesirabledelay in the build-up of the essential additional expenditure described in paragraph 4 above.British Waterways Board35.

Reductions required to achieve savings of 2\per cent in 1978-79 and 5 per cent in later years would be:  million1978-79   1979-80   1980-81   1981-82Thames tidal scheme .     1-9        3-7        2-4        2-other arterial drain-age:Capital -    0-9        1-8        1-8        1-82-8        5-5        4-2        4-137. There are no possibilities of reductions in expenditure on the Thames scheme without delay-ing the completion of downstream defence works,thus exposing these areas to increased risk of flood-ing if the barrier had to be operated. Savings on capital expenditure on other arterial drainage couldmean delaying land drainage and flood protectionwork carried out by regional water authorities, in-cluding the provision of flood protection for existing urban development and for new housingsites, as well as work to improve the drainage ofagricultural land.LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATERSERVICESscotland38.

The Scottish Office are sceptical about the feasibility of reductions on local environmental and water services to offset the additional bids for capital and to meet the policy options set out above.Water and sewerage capital40. The Scottish Office maintain that reductions in the Cmnd. 6721 provision would create mountingpressure on treatment standards and delay progress on major new schemes. They could be achievedonly by deferring water supply schemes requiredto meet increasing industrial and housing demand and relieve seasonable shortages and by furtherdeferring important sewage treatment schemes in-volving narrower choices regarding location ofindustry or acceptance of lower treatment standardswith consequent health risks.Local environmental and sewerage services current41. On local environmental services current ex-penditure the Scottish Office consider that provision in the survey figures is already so far short of actualspending that further policy reductions are notfeasible. Any further savings the local authoritiescan achieve by way of increased charges or more economic provision of services will be required to offset inevitable increases arising from recentcapital expenditure. Greater savings could not beachieved without new legislation to direct localauthorities on levels of services and charges.Similar arguments apply to current expenditure onsewerage.Local environmental services capital42. On capital expenditure for local environ-mental services the Scottish Office point out that the survey provision already assumes a severe curtail-ment of less immediately essential services suchas administrative buildings and even provision of factories by local authorities which it is now policy to encourage to a limited extent in inner cityareas. Any further reductions would leave a verysmall margin for new starts in 1978-79 and would leave many authorities with little scope for anythingbut essential replacements of vehicles and urgentunforeseen requirements. It might also requireclosure of some facilities such as recreational facilities and public halls needing repair.The Treasury view43. The Treasury point out however that formulaoption reductions on water services capital would,proportionately, be considerably less than the reductions implied by the plans of the English
and Welsh water authorities after a more comprehensive analysis of investment than has yetbeen undertaken in Scotland. Formula reductions would provide:  million1978-79     1979-80     1980-81      1981-821-53-13-23-244. If the balance of the required offsetting savings and option reductions were applied to localenvironmental services capital expenditure cuts ofthe following order would be required:  million1978-79     1979-80     1980-81      1981-825-510-912-814-845. Even after cuts of this size, capital expen-diture on local environmental services in scotland would, on a per capita basis, be over one and a half times as great as that provided in Cmnd. 6721,for England and Wales by the end of the survey period or three times as great if the England andWales provision is reduced on the lines described in paragraph 31.THE URBAN PROGRAMME46. This covers the expenditure on an expandedurban programme which was agreed recently by ministers. A more detailed description includingthe resources to be made available to it fromother programmes is included in supplementaryanalysis 5.england47- Expenditure shown in programme 8 repre-sents a significant proportion of the expandedurban programme for England. First, it drawstQgether expenditure from several existing sources.*t includes the Department of the Environmentcomponents of the existing urban programme, therest of which will now be included in the pro-Srammes of those other departments which haveCQntributed to the urban programme in the past.*t also includes resources transferred from the new towns programme, local authority housing and localenvironmental services.48. To those existing resources have been addedthose which were announced in the 1977 budget statement for construction works in inner citiesduring 1977-78 and 1978-79 ( 76 million).49.   The	programme	in total	is:					  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-8230-1	55-9	62-7	62-7	62-750. The sum of  76 million for construction workin inner cities has been allocated in full to this programme on a provisional basis until it can bedetermined how much should be allocated to other programmes. It is divided between the two years in the ration 1:2 (i.e.  25 million and  51 million)because it is unlikely that many starts could bemade before the third quarter of this financial year.wales51. The Welsh share of the package for construc-tion work in inner cities ( 2 - 3 million in each of theyears 1977-78 and 1978-79), has also been allocated to this programme on a provisional basis. Thesesums are to be spent on roads, health and schoolprojects bearing on urban and deprivation problems and will eventually be transferred to thoseprogrammes.scotland52. Cmnd. 6721 made the following provision forthe urban programme in Scotland:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-825-6	7-9	101	101	10153. Further enlargement of the programme was announced in April to give effect in Scotland to theGovernment^ decisions to devote more resources to the alleviation of problems of multiple depriva-tion in inner city areas. The higher level of pro-vision will enable assistance for individual projectstraditionally included in the programme to be con-tinued and an increasing contribution to be made to new comprehensive programmes such as the joint
8.  Other Environmental Servicesscheme for Glasgow eastern area renewal com-menced last year.   In addition the programme for1977-78 and 1978-1979 has been boosted by theconstruction package for the inner cities announced in the Budget speech which is being met from the contingency reserve.  In order to fulfil the commit-ment to provide further resources to allow localauthorities   to   plan   co-ordinated   rehabilitationschemes for large areas of urban deprivation, theScottish Office propose to raise the total provisionfor the programme to about  20 million by 1980-81.This will be achieved by adding the sum of 2-2 million a year from 1979-80 which cabinet decided should be charged against the contingency reserve together with a redeployment of resources from other Scottish programmes (not yet includedin the baseline figures).NEW TOWNS, INDUSTRIAL and commercial DEVELOPMENTOptions for reductions54. Reductions, particularly in later years, couldimpair employment prospects to the extent thatindustrialists still depend on readily availablefactory space. Recent policy changes towards new towns, which will produce substantial savings in housing investment, will not affect the need for this expenditure during the survey period as it is alreadylagging behind the provision of housing and otherinfrastructure. Although difficult, the option re-reductions would not be impracticable relative to themore straightened local authority position and on a percentage basis would be:  million	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82England Scotland  .	1-0 0-4	20 0-8	20 0-9	2-0 0-9COMMUNITY OWNERSHIP OFDEVELOPMENT LAND55. This expenditure provides for the purchase,administrative and interest costs of the localauthorities and the Land Authority for Wales of buying and making available land for privatedevelopment in their areas. The provision is net of receipts for land disposals. The scheme is beingcontrolled initially by separate borrowing approvals.56. The expenditure forecasts are shown on a netbasis so that although the provision levels off in1981-82, increasing receipts from land disposalswill allow for continued growth in that year. During1976-77, the first year of the land scheme&apos;s opera-tion, authorities were slow to acquire communityland and expenditure fell below the provision made.This was largely because of the general state of the economy, the sluggish market and the newness ofthe land scheme itself. The growth provided for in subsequent years should enable authorities to makesteady progress towards meeting a substantial pro-portion of the developers&apos; land needs, althoughprogress will be slower than had been hoped forearlier because of the cuts in 1977-78 and 1978-79announced in December 1976.Options for reductions57. The 2-i per cent and 5 per cent option re-reductions will slow down the rate of build-up of thescheme. Any larger cuts would affect the credibilityof the scheme.   The figures would be:  million1978-79    1979-80    1980-81    1981-82EnglandWalesScotland1-401013-50-30-44-30-40-44-30-40-4ROYAL PALACES AND PARKSImplications of survey figures58.  The provision reflects broadly the same levelof work as in 1977-78.   There are no bids for additional  expenditure.    Policy options do  notexceed  1 million in any one year.HISTORIC BUILDINGS AND ANCIENTMONUMENTSImplications of survey figures59. Expenditure on this item maintains broadly the same level of work as in 1977-78 in grants fofthe repair of historic buildings, other related servicesand the purchase, maintenance, repair and displayof ancient monuments and the excavation 0^archaeological sites before they are developed orotherwise destroyed. No specific provision has beenmade for the introduction in England and Walesfor repair grants for historic churches in use.60.  There are no bids for additional expenditure-
Options for reductions61- Reductions in England of 2\ per cent in1978-79 and 5 per cent in the later years would produce the following savings:  million1978-79     1979-80     1980-81      1981-820-61-21-21-2The expenditure currently available for the pro-tection and preservation of the archaeological andarchitectural heritage is already insufficient to meetgrowing demands and any reduction in the level of funds would result in the loss of some important part of this heritage which could otherwise havebeen saved. For this reason any reduction ofexpenditure would have to be concentrated on the plans for the provision of car parks, toilets andother facilities for visitors and administration costs.It is not possible to regulate the number of visitors to ancient monuments; and if reasonable facilities are not provided for visitors, public safety andhygiene and sometimes the monument itself will beat risk. The policy is to increase admission chargesregularly but not to an extent that would detervisitors.62. The bulk of expenditure on historic buildingsis in the form of grants to owners of historic build-ings. The demand for grant continues to increase and any reduction would seriously impair the workof preservation of historic buildings. Control one*penditure is exercised by way of a commitmentration which allows neither an increase in volumenor revaluation of cash committed, although thisration will be revalued annually from 1977.CENTRAL AND MISCELLANEOUSENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES63- This covers expenditure on departmentaladministration, on environmental research and on environmental bodies (including the sports councils,the Nature Conservancy Council and the country-s&apos;de commissions) and a number of other smallitems.4dditional bidsEnvironmental bodies64- An additional bid of  2 million in 1981-82 isrequired for a contribution by central governmentSECRETto enable a start on renewal or replacement ofHampden Park, Glasgow, as a Scottish nationalstadium. The scale and method of financing the project have yet to be worked out in the light ofthe Scottish Sports Council&apos;s recommendationsexpected later this year. The department are unableto identify any offsetting savings within theprogramme.Options for reductionsEnvironmental research65. The illustrative reductions for the environ-mental research programme would amount to 0-5 million in 1978-79,  1-1 million in 1979-80and  1-2 million a year thereafter. However, theprovision for environmental research has been sub-stantially reduced by the 1975 and 1976 surveys,and by cuts in civil service manpower. Further cuts would significantly reduce the capacity to respond to the increase in demand for research into environ-mental questions particularly in the fields of buildingdesign, planning and pollution. Nevertheless,despite these qualifications the cuts are regarded asrealistic and feasible.Environmental bodies66. The total illustrative reduction under thefollowing four headings amounts to about 0-5 million in 1978-79 and  1-0 million a yearthereafter. Such a reduction however distributedwould be disruptive to some of the bodies con-cerned but not impossible given a need for some general retrenchment.(i) Sports councilsPrevious cuts have already foreclosed anyearly prospect of growth in the overall level ofsports councils activities. We expect a significantfall-off in claims on the councils for grant-aid tolocal authority projects except in deprived areas but this is unlikely to account for the whole ofthe option cuts. The balance would fall inthe main on the maintenance of national sportcentres and their adaptation to changing require-ments. In Scotland the balance might fall mainly on grants to local voluntary sports clubs.(ii) Nature Conservancy CouncilPrevious cuts have already foreclosed any earlyprospect of the Nature Conservancy Council being able to carry out adequately the full statutory81
8.   Other Environmental Servicesremit given to it on its establishment in 1973.Any reduction in its current level of activitywould necessarily fall in the main on the care ofexisting national nature reserves and especially on maintenance work there. There is already a heavy backlog of such work (dating from beforethe creation of the necessarily) which is only just now beginning to be made good. The effects wouldbe serious and cumulative over the years.(iii) Countryside commissionsNearly half of the allocation goes to supportrecurrent expenditure on information and visitorfacilities and represents commitments from whichthe commissions could not very well escape. the impact of the illustrative reductions on the commissions&apos; experimental work and on grants to non-public bodies would therefore be dis-proportionately severe; and (given the extremesmallness of the commissions&apos; budgets bothabsolutely and in relation to their responsibilities)would be very hard indeed to absorb.(iv) other the impact of cuts on the small budgets ofthe other miscellaneous services would be veryhard to absorb. If the illustrative reductions hadto be made in this group it might be necessary to terminate one or more of the services rather than to attempt to make significant adjustments inthe few that are capable of reduction without legislation or breach of a commitment.

About 80 per cent of this programme is localauthority expenditure, mainly on manpower-intensive services subject to specific grants. In thelight of information obtained from rate support grant negotiations it seems likely that Cmnd. 6721levels of expenditure for the later years will be exceeded on police (goods and services, pensionsand school-crossing patrols) and on fire service pensions.2. For 1978-79 onwards there is insufficientprovision in the programme for current expenditure to maintain existing policies for the basic law andorder services; and provision for capital expen-diture is already reduced to a level which it isconsidered would meet only the absolute minimumneeds. As the fundamental law and order services are manpower-intensive, savings can be made only by reductions in staff, with detrimental effects onthe efficiency of police, courts, probation, fire, andthe risk of a major breakdown in the prison system-
Given the powers and duties of police, courts andprobation committees under existing law, and the formal basic obligations to maintain acceptablestandards in the prison service, significant reduc-tions in law and order expenditure merits apart would require main legislation of a controversialkind.3- Against this background the Home Office havenot been able to identify sufficient realistic savings to offset their additional bids. Nor is there anyway in which illustrative reductions under the survey guidelines could be achieved except by reducing essential protective services. In particular,the Home Office see no practical scope for furthercuts in capital expenditure.Implications of the survey figuresADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICELord Chancellor^ Office4- The Lord Chancellor is responsible for thecapital and current expenditure in the highercourts in England and Wales; for legal aid in allcivil cases and in criminal cases in the magistrates&apos;courts; for legal advice and assistance; and for aid to certain law centres.5- With the exception of the court building pro-gramme, it has been possible to meet existing policy requirements within Cmnd. 6721. the forecast rise in criminal business coming before theCrown Court (from 57,200 in 1977-78 to 66,500in 1981-82) suggests, however, that it will bemcreasingly difficult in the later years of the surveyto maintain current expenditure at a constant level.?&apos; The moratorium on new building intro-duced in December 1976 affected the higher courtsbuilding programme disproportionately because ofthe large number of schemes that would have been started in the years concerned. Without further provision waiting time will rise in some courtcentres to a year or more. An additional problemls that the Crown Court may not be able tocontinue in occupation of a number of court roomswhen the &quot; rights of user &quot; afforded by the courts act, 1971 expire at the end of 1981.ttome OfficeMagistrates&apos; courts* Provision in the survey for expenditure onMagistrates&apos; courts is inadequate to match the continuing rise in the volume of business forecastby the local authorities which provide the service.But revenue from fines and fees, which is includedin the survey for the first time, exceeds the costs,and the additional expenditure would be matched by increased revenue.8. The survey figures for capital expenditure will cover the completion of court houses already under construction but no major work thereafter.Legal aid9. The scope of the scheme is fixed by statute andthe level of expenditure is related largely to thenumber of applicants. The survey figures shouldbe sufficient to meet the expected continuing increasein the cost of legal aid but the Home Office is considering further changes in practice which would help to ensure that expenditure is held within presentprovisions.Criminal Injuries Compensation Board10. The Board is required to assess compensationbroadly on the basis of common law damages. the survey figures are inadequate to meet the expected increase in cost resulting from the growth in thenumber of applicants and real increases in the levels of award (despite a recent increase in thelower limit for awards from  50 to  150).TREATMENT OF OFFENDERSPrisons11. The average inmate population for 1976-77was 41,550, about 400 more than assumed in Cmnd.6721. The average number does not indicate themaximum number the prison system may have tohold at any given time, which could be about1,700 more. The population is forecast to rise overthe period to just over 44,000. Most current expenditure is on wages of prison staff and additional provision is required to cover the man-power costs of containing the rising prison popu-lation and the maintenance of existing standards ofcontrol and security. The manpower implications of the custodial care of offenders are the subject ofa current programme analysis and review, but theHome Office view is that restrictions to the basiclevel of survey provision would require manyprisoners to spend more time in their cells with consequent further reductions in the value of out-put from prison industries, and greater risk of
serious unrest among the prison population andthe staff. In the view of the Civil Service Depart-ment, the additional provision for 1981-82 needed to maintain existing standards is no more than 3 - 2 million.12. The expected receipts from prison industries have fallen seriously below forecasts, due mainly to reduced availability of supervisory staff in prisonworkshops on account of several factors: restric-tions on overtime working; disturbances, such asthat at Hull, which affect the system widely; and increased demands of the courts. The poor currentperformance of prison industries is expected to affect their future markets.13. The survey figures will allow building schemes already started to be completed and these willprovide a net addition of nearly 3,500 places.Probation and after-care14. The survey figures provide for the number of probation officers to rise from 4,700 to 5,025 bythe end of 1980-81. This does not allow fully forthe potential growth of work (and hence staffrequirements), but may allow some extension of community service schemes, and for 314 places inadult probation hostels and 305 in adult bailhostels in addition to the present 759 and 75 respec-tively, which are lower rates than envisaged in cmnd. 6721. Grant-aided after-care hostel placesprovided by voluntary bodies will rise to 2,270 atthe end of 1978-79 and remain at that level.GENERAL PROTECTIVE SERVICESPolice15. In the last twelve months the rate of recruit-ing of police officers has been lower than expected and the rate of wastage has been higher, with theresult that the actual number of police on 31March 1977 was 109,500. Thereafter the surveyprovision assumes that police manpower will con-tinue to grow, but more slowly than had been assumed in Cmnd. 6721, to 113,000 by 31 March1980 with no further growth in the next two years.The Home Office assume that Ministers will con-tinue to take the same view of the priority attachedto police recruitment as they have in the past(reflected in Cmnd. 6721 in the statement that, ifnumbers should exceed the estimated growth,provision will be made for additional expenditure within authorised establishments).16. The survey figures assume a sharp reductionin the number of civilians, including traffic wardensand cadets, from 43,500 on 31 March 1977 to38,620 on 31 March 1982.17. On the capital side the survey figures allow for a start on two new police headquarters in1977-78, one at Merseyside and one at Manchester,and a very small margin for other operationalbuildings. Provision is also made for the replace-ment police national computer in 1978-79, for two larger forensic laboratories to replace threeexisting ones, and for some redevelopment of thepolice training centres. By the end of the survey period the scale and standard of many buildingswill be far short of the requirements of the service.Fire services18. The survey base figures reflect the assumptionthat the numbers of whole time firemen, of part-timefiremen and junior firemen and of civilian staff,would remain constant at about 32,400, 14,000and 5,300, respectively. To limit numbers to these levels depends upon the co-operation of localauthorities. On 31 December 1976 the actualnumber of whole-time firemen (including controlroom staff) in post was 32,600, lie. 200 above thelimit provided for in the survey figures.19. The figures for capital expenditure assumed limited and sharply declining building pro-gramme. This will mean the continuance in serviceof out of date fire stations and will require further postponement of replacement programmes for fireappliances. The cumulative effects, year on year,of cutting or postponing these replacements will inevitably lead to a serious loss of operational efficiency with consequent risk to life and property.Other protective services20. Most of this expenditure is concerned withthe administration of the naturalisation service andcontrols of immigration, but the programme alsocovers the immigration appeal system and a grant in aid to the United Kingdom ImmigrantsAdvisory Service. The Home Office hope to contain expenditure on these services within the survey figures.CIVIL DEFENCE21. Annual expenditure by the Home Officeamounts to about  8 million covering (in order of
priority): warning and monitoring, central training,grants to county councils, policy, administration and scientific work and stockpiles. Reductions in less urgent stocks of equipment and the restrictions in local authority expenditure should enable expen-diture to be contained within the survey figures.22. The civil defence provision also includesexpenditure by some other departments, in par-ticular on the oil storage and pipeline system(Department of Energy) and emergency and strategic reserves of food (Ministry of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food).23. By Treasury direction, the Department of energy&apos;s provision for the oil storage and pipelinesystem has been reduced to nil. The future ofthe system and the method of financing is underreview and until this is resolved the costs will bemet by receipts from the sale of stocks of oil.24. The survey provision for food stocks, whichis included partly under civil defence and partlyunder civil emergencies, rises to  4-0 million in1978-79 and drops to  3-4 million a year, there-after. The additional requirement which theMinistry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food con-sider necessary to turn over stocks economically and maintain them in good condition is less than 1 million in any year.COMMUNITY SERVICES25. Cmnd. 6721 made provision for financing theEqual Opportunities Commission and the new commission for Racial Equality, and the surveyfigures will allow these commissions to functionat the planned level. Provision is also made toenable the Home Office to continue grants to voluntary organisations at their present level of activity. (Provision for the urban programme isno longer included following the transfer of respon-sibility to the Department of the Environment.)Rhodesia26. No provision was made in Cmnd. 6721 fordealing with a possible influx of refugees from rhodesia.CENTRAL AND MISCELLANEOUSSERVICES27.

The application of the specified percentagesWould require savings of  2-6 million in 1978-79, 5&apos;7 million in 1979-80 and  5-8 million in1980-81 and 1981-82. Any reduction in the levelof expenditure on court building would further increase the waiting time for trial. The remainingoption is to raise the fees for civil litigation. a move to full recovery of costs would require anincrease in fees by one-third, and this would increase receipts by  11 million. The Treasuryaccept, however, that it would not be feasible tomove to full cost recovery during the survey period, and that, if the offsetting saving in para-Sraph 29 is taken, there would be no scope forfurthereconomies   on   the   Lord   ChancellorsProgramme.the anti-discrimination bodies are ruledbecause they would require main legislation.out*fome Office1978-197932-  The requirement for 1978-79 is a total of 2\per cent off the present provision of  1,593 million,Which is  39-8 million.  Options, even if they wereasible, for reducing legal aid or expenditure onSECRET33. The requirement could be found by closinga quarter of prison establishments, with an appro-priate scale of remission and an amnesty, andredundancy of staff. Much, but perhaps not all of this, could be done by the exercise of the prerogative and subordinate legislation. the savings would probably be more than offset by thecost of lump sum redundancy payments and neces-sary maintenance of establishments while they werebeing disposed of.34. An alternative option would be to reducethe manpower of police forces. 1,000 police officerscost  5 million a year, so a cut of 8,000 wouldbe sufficient, taking the service back over a decadeand reversing the much publicised policies of suc-sucessive Governments. Abolition of the trafficwarden and cadet services would produce further savings which would enable the cut in police officers to be less drastic. None of these proposal is really feasible, and, save in the unlikely eventof the local authorities co-operating, legislation toreduce police establishments and to control civilianestablishments would be necessary.89m
1979-80 to 1981-8235. The requirement for 1979-80 to 1981-82 isa total of 5 per cent off the present provision of nearly  1,590 million in each year i.e. about  80million a year.36. Savings of this order are even less practicablethan those discussed above but had measures beentaken to close a quarter of prison establishments in1978-79 (at no net saving in that year as explained)a saving of about  50 million would be possible ineach of these later years (the continuing commit-ment to redundancy pensions might begin to be offset by the sale of quarters and some of the sites). Coupled with the saving on police man-power suggested for 1978-79, the requirementcould be achieved. Again, it is very doubtful if all this could be done without some main legislation.scotlandImplications of the survey figuresADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE37. The expenditure on court services, Crownprosecutions and other legal services is expected tobe broadly contained within Cmnd. 6721 figuresexcept for the last two years when more capitalexpenditure would be necessary to meet the cost ofa new Glasgow Sheriff Court House. For legal aid, the present provision is insufficient to meetthe latest forecasts of demand. The scope of thescheme is fixed by statute and because Scottishdivorce law differs from English, there is no possi-bility of making offsetting savings by withdrawinglegal aid from undefended divorce cases as hasbeen done in England and Wales.Criminal Injuries Compensation Board38. The Scottish Office meet a fixed proportionof the cost of the scheme. For the reasons give in paragraph 10 above, the survey provision is inadequate.TREATMENT OF OFFENDERSPrisons39. It is estimated that the total number ofprisoners held in custody in Scotland will increase by about 8 per cent over the period, from anaverage of 5,125 in 1977-78 to about 5,525 in1981-82, continuing the trend assumed in Cmnd.6721. The survey figures imply no new startson major buildings, which would lead to a worsen-ing of standards and accommodation.GENERAL PROTECTIVE SERVICESPolice40. Assessment of the latest trends in recruitment and wastage suggest that the number of policemenin post will now rise more slowly than was assumed in Cmnd. 6721: from 12,300 to 12,600 over theperiod. This would mean that strength in oneor two areas will remain considerably belowauthorised establishments which total 13,164.Should the net rate of growth exceed the estimateprovision will have to be made for additional expenditure within authorised establishments.41. These reduced manpower forecasts are theresult of an increased retirement rate in 1976-77which is likely to continue for some years. the resulting increase in the level of pension payments(including commuted sums) can be contained withinthe survey figures when the reduction in cost of active strength is taken into account, except in1981-82.Fire services42. The survey base figures assume that thenumbers of full-time firemen will remain at 3,900,that numbers of part-time firemen will remainconstant and that there will be some reduction in civilian staff by natural wastage over the period.Local authorities appear to be keeping within theselimits. Provisional outturn figures for 1976-77and budget estimates for 1977-78 have howeverconfirmed that the provision made did not allowsufficiently for the effects on support costs of theintroduction of the 48-hour week and the provisionfor pension payments is also inadequate. Theprovision also is insufficient to cover the opera-tional costs of stations being built or extended asa consequence of North Sea oil developments.43. Capital expenditure provision has already been cut to a level which, after allowing for necessarypurchases of equipment, will allow for only theminimum of building projects.Additional bids44.

The possibility of finding offsetting savings tothe above bids is being considered in the context of overall Scottish programmes.Options for reductions46. The illustrative options of 2\ per cent and5 per cent would require total savings of about 4-4 million in 1978-79 and about  8-4 million in later years. Because these services are manpowerintensive, savings can be made only by severereductions in staff with very detrimental effectsQn the efficiency of police, courts, fire and prisonservices. Significant reductions in law and orderexpenditure would require major and controversiallegislation. Police, fire service and prison man-power have already been severely restricted andwill continue to be so. With the police serviceaccounting for over 60 per cent of the total pro-vision on this programme, cuts of this magnitudecould be obtained only by massive cuts in policeexpenditure, possibly by reducing strengths toabout 10,800 (compared with an authorised estab-lishment of 13,164) i.e. reversing the policies ofrecent years and putting the police back to wherethey were in 1971. It would probably also benecessary to make correspondingly severe cuts in prison establishments and manpower. Again it isvery doubtful if such cuts could be implemented,even if practicable, without some main legislation.91m2

Provision was made in Cmnd. 6721 for national average staffing standards in schools to be main-tained, though not improved, up to 1980-81.  this approach, continued from the 1976 public expen-diture White Paper (Cmnd. 6393), was a response to the need to contain local authority expenditure as a whole within acceptable levels.   With fallingnumbers of pupils, it will progressively generatedifficult problems and strains for the staffing of the schools.   Teacher numbers will not fall exactly in line with school rolls in areas, such as inner cities,where the child population is falling rapidly.   Ifthe overall ratio were to remain constant, theimprovement  in  staffing  ratios  in  these  areas would need to be matched by worsening standardselsewhere.    Differences    in   standards    betweenauthorities would increase as time went on, a development unlikely to be acceptable to the localauthorities concerned.   Continued low wastage andturnover among teachers will add to the problemsof some local authorities in adjusting staffing to match changes in the pattern of demand and in recruiting teachers for specific purposes (for ex-ample, to relieve the shortages in mathematics,science and handicraft and to meet the needs ofdeprived children and ethnic minorities).    Somemargin of flexibility is needed to mitigate the worst of these effects.4. Cmnd. 6721 provides for the expansion of in-service and induction training which the Depart-ment of Education and Science regards as essentialto improve the quality of the teaching force and tomake good the shortage of specialist teachers.Allowing for this expansion, the continuation in1981-82 of the existing policy of no improvementin national average staffing standards would involvereducing the number of teachers in that year by20,000 (4 per cent) below that in 1977-78 to match the falling pupil numbers. The random impact ofthis reduction means that enforced redundancymight be necessary to achieve it in some areas.5. To help accommodate these strains, the surveyfigures have been so deployed as to allow aneasement in existing policy to provide 3,000additional teachers in 1981-82. This would diminish the reduction that would otherwise berequired in that year from 11,000 to 8,000. (Aproposal to go further in this direction is recorded as item 2 (a) in paragraph 25.)
Non-teaching costs6. Increases in non-teaching unit costs in schoolsare likely to occur both as pupil numbers fall in both primary and secondary schools during the survey period and as the proportion of older pupilsincreases. The survey figures for 1980-81 and1981-82 do not provide for this in full.Building7. The existing policy requires places for under-fives in nursery and primary schools to be heldconstant at their 1976-77 level. A building pro-gramme of  3-3 million starts a year from 1978-79would continue on a limited scale a policy of allowing local authorities to provide specificnursery accommodation to replace existing places in primary schools in areas of greatest need.8. The component in paragraph 2 for basic needs in primary and secondary schools is intended toprovide the extra places to cope with the movementof population from one area to another. the schools improvement programme, suspended in1977-78, will enable only modest progress to bemade towards remedying deficiencies in pre-1903primary schools in areas of special need and will include a very few secondary improvements thatcontribute towards secondary reorganisation. Theprovision for special education will just enablethose projects, totalling  8 million, which were cancelled in 1976-77 to be restored to the pro-gramme; and will leave a substantial backlog ofwork to replace the worst old buildings.Meals9. The savings implied by Cmnd. 6721 in theadministration of the school meals service are under discussion between the Department of Educa-tion and Science and the local authorities. Theintention is to lower the unit cost of themeal without reducing its nutritional content.It is not yet possible to say what the final outcome of these discussions will be but, even if thesesavings are achieved, the present policy of reducingthe percentage subsidy by 1980 from its present levelof 70 per cent to something under 30 per cent would,on price assumptions used for the survey, requirethe following run of charges for a school meal:Autumn	1977	1978	1979	1980	1981	25p	39p	48p	50p	57pThe increase	from the	present	charge	of	15p to25p in Autumn 1977 has been announced.Higher and further education10. Revised demand projections for non-advancedfurther education take account of:(i) students whose maintenance is provided from the trade, industry and employmentprogramme (TOPS and TSA courses);(ii) a proportion of students who might other-wise have trained as teachers; and(iii) additional demand created by continuinghigh unemployment among 16-19 year olds.11. The survey figures also reflect the conse-quences of the announced increases in tuitionfees for academic year 1977-78, the further savings from this source in 1978-79, and the pro-posed limitation on overseas student numbers(although the last two of these still have to besecured). For higher education the figures are consistent with a figure of 560,000 full-time andsandwich course students in Great Britain in1981-82, of whom 310,000 are expected to findplaces in the universities. The reduction in teacher training places is expected to be compensated byan increase, over the survey period, in studentnumbers in other forms of advanced further education where the increase is expected to be 28per cent. The corresponding increase in universitieswould be 12 per cent.Libraries12. Some growth in current expenditure for theBritish Library will be needed to meet the inevitable increase in its collections. The smallgrowth in current expenditure on public librariesis required to reflect local authority capital expen-diture on new library buildings.13. Provision has been made to enable a start in1979-80 on the new building for the BritishLibrary at Euston as follows:  million1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	0-1	1-8	3-0	In 1981-82 this provision falls short of the expen-diture required by  4 million. The present total estimated gross cost of the first phase is  ^5 million. A decision is needed this year 00whether to start the project in 1979-80.
IMPLICATIONS OF SURVEY FIGURES14. For the period up to 1979-80 the base figures are sufficient to sustain existing policies provided the required savings on school meals, tuition fees and overseas student numbers are obtained (see paragraphs 9 and 11 above) and provided that theschool meal charge is actually increased as inParagraph 9. By 1980-81, however, the savingsattributable to the fall in the number of pupils of compulsory school age are likely to be more than offset by the additional costs of meeting risingdemands from the older age-groups (including 16 to19 year olds in both secondary schools and non-advanced further education). Subject to theProvisos mentioned, the continuation of present policies in those years (together with the easementProposed in paragraph 5) would require anadditional  20 million in 1980-81 and  88 million in 1981-82 above the survey figures.15. If these additional resources were not avail-able, it would be necessary to make the following main adjustments to existing policies:  millionReductions in cost1980-81 1981-82(a)(6)(e)id)although there would be room for themin terms of building and plant, it wouldbe necessary to restrict admissions to higher education institutions by some5,000 students in the autumn of 1980and a further 15,000 in the following year(3 and 9 per cent respectively of thoselikely to be qualified for entry)the school meal charge which is toincrease annually over the survey period(see paragraph 9) would have to beraised by a further 2p from April 1981(unless further savings could be obtained in unit costs); allowing for the latestforecast of inflation, the charge in schoolyear 1981-82 would then be 59p .local authorities would be obliged to restrict educational transport facilities(an alternative would be to make a flat-rate charge of say, 6p a journey butthat would require legislation)regulations under the Education Act,1976 enabling local authorities toProvide milk otherwise than as pre-scribed in the Education (Milk) Act, 1971Would have to be further deferred (theyare at present deferred in 1977-78 and1978-79)  ......411315  millionReductions in cost1980-81 1981-82(e) a start on the construction of the BritishLibrary&apos;s new building in Euston Roadwould have to be delayed makingnecessary continuing temporary accom-modation and increasing the difficultyof providing efficient operation of thenational archives       ....(J) public libraries would no longer be ableto provide for the running costs of facilities coming into use or the highercosts of book acquisitions  .ScotlandPRESENT POLICIES16.

17. The building programme in Scotland is con-trolled by expenditure and not, as in England andWales, by starts. The programmes consistent withCmnd. 6721 are:  million7977 7975 7979 7950 7957-75    -79    -50    -57    -82Under rives      .      . .0-7 0-7 0-6 0-6 0-6Primary and secondary:Basic needs   -      - -   41-9 32-5 28-6 28-4 28-4Improvements       - -     6-4 2-8 2-3 2-2 2-special schools .      . .2-6 2-1 2-1 2-2 2-2Further education -   11-1 9-7 8-2 8-2 8-2Schools (and under fives)Current expenditure18. During the survey period the decline inprimary pupil numbers is expected to continue and secondary pupil numbers will start to fall formingthe basis for the reduced requirements identified inparagraph 24. However local education authoritiesare unlikely to be willing to achieve the pro-portionate reductions in expenditure implied bycontinued rigid adherence to existing policies onpupil/teacher ratios and on the allowance fornon-teaching expenditure. They will expect toimprove staffing standards, in particular to allow for some increase in in-service training, and toprovide for an increase in non-teaching unit coststo offset the continued diseconomies of reducedschool numbers.19. The survey figures do not provide for the achievement of the recommended staffing standards in special schools. Nor do they provide for the implementation of the recommendations of thePack Committee on truancy and indiscipline or ofthe Munn and Dunning Committee on secondarycurriculum and assessment (all expected to reportlater this year). There is no commitment to imple-ment these recommendations but each is likely torequire substantial expenditure.Capital20. The expenditure limits would permit the policies announced in Cmnd. 6721 to be continuedbut at the cost of deterioration in the state ofexisting buildings.Higher and further education21. The survey figures provide for the con-continuation of existing policies, except in the case ofteacher training. In colleges of further educationthey imply a reduction in staffing standards belowexisting levels from 1979-80. No provision is madefor the implementation of the Alexander Report (onadult education in Scotland).22. In teacher training, the rundown in staff hasnot kept pace with the rapid rundown in studentnumbers from 12,700 in 1975-76 to 8,800 in1977-78. The student/staff ratio in 1977-78 will therefore be considerably below the ratio on whichthe survey figures are based (6-4:1 compared with10-0:1); with increased provision for in-service training the ratio will increase to 8 - 3 :1 but this will still require a quarter of the teaching force in this field to be made redundant. The survey figures donot provide for compensation payments to thesestaff but the amount required for a gradual run-down to 8-3:1 could be met within the marginidentified in paragraph 24 below.Libraries23. Provision is made for a continuation of current expenditure at Cmnd. 6721 levels.IMPLICATIONS OF SURVEY FIGURES24. Assuming that the revised assessment of demand mentioned in paragraph 16 could be accompanied by the continuation of existing poli-cies which, as indicated in paragraphs 18 and 22,the Scottish Education Department consider to be impracticable expenditure could be reduced asfollows:  million_1978-79 1979-80 1980-81 1981^Current:LA expenditure  .	-4	0	-3-9	-4-2	-11-6Central government ex-					penditure	-4	5	-3-5	-40	-3-capital:					-4-0LA expenditure  -	-1	4	-3-3	-40	Central government ex-					penditure			-0-4	-0-4	-0-4ADDITIONAL BIDSEngland and Wales25. In addition to the sums required to maintainexisting policy in 1980-81 and 1981-82 (see para-graph 14 above) the department propose the follow-ing new developments although they are unable to
identify any offsetting savings within the pro-gramme. Some of these items would lead to a potential saving in public expenditure on social security benefits, depending on the employment situation. There is one other, minor, additional bidof  1 million in each of the years 1979-80 to1981-82 which is not included in the table below:  million1978 1979 1980 1981-79    -80    -81    -821- Education of the 16-19 year-oldgroup: complementary measuresto those proposed by ManpowerServices Commission Report onYoung People and Work(a) Improved educational mainten-ance allowances (LA)(6) Allowances for students in non-advanced further education(subject to parental contri-bution) (LA) ....(c) 40,000 additional pupils and students:Current expenditure (LA)Capital expenditure (LA)2.

Ifthe potential reductions of expenditure set out inparagraph 24 were used to offset the cost of these,they would cover about 90 per cent of additionalbids for 1978-79, and between one-half and two-thirds of those in later years. The departmentattach priority to the items in the list below. Theyhave not put forward parallel bids to those by theDepartment of Education and Science for new developments, i.e. allowances for students in non-advanced further education and abolition of parentalcontributions, but any decision to adopt these policies would inevitably lead to additional expendi-ture in Scotland:  million1978 1979 1980 1981-79    -80    -81    -821.

OPTIONS FOR REDUCTIONS27.   The Treasury and the education departments have discussed the options described in the sectionbelow but have not reached agreement on all ofthem.England and Wales28. Reductions in public expenditure by 2\ percent in 1978-79 and 5 per cent in each year there-after would require the following total savings onDepartment of Education and Science and, whererelevant, Welsh Office programmes:  million  million	1978	1979	1980	1981	-79	-80	-81	-82Total ....	.   179	360	362	362Education and libraries	.   170	341	345	34529. The options which follow have been devisedand costed on the assumption that the measures inparagraph 15 would already have had to be taken.Because of the reductions made in earlier public expenditure surveys, the option savings could bemade only by cutting deeply into the fabric of the educational system given the labour intensive natureof the service. Such a course would mean sub-stantial redundancies with a lowering of standards in the compulsory sector and restriction of access to higher and further education. In the depart-ment&apos;s view, the following options can be regardedonly as illustrative and would entail long and difficult negotiations with local authorities and theunions concerned. The actual savings achievedwould be likely to be considerably below the maxi-mum figures shown because of the need to makelarge numbers of redundancy payments.Summary table education and libraries  million7975 1979 1980 1981-79    -80    -81    -82Schools(a) Halt the transfer of under fivesto specialist accommodation(LA):Current .... 2Capital     ....    17975		1979	7950	1981	-79	-80	-5/	-82(b) Building programmes (LA):				(i) Reduce basic needs by 50				per cent ....	25	50	65	65(ii) Suspend   special   school				starts    ....	2	5	6	6(iii) Suspend schools improve-				ment programme	7	13	15	14(c) Reduce non-teaching unit costs				in schools by 5^ per cent (LA) .	59	61	63	65(d)   (i) Increase by 5p each year the				planned level of school meal				charges (LA) (DES option) or (ii) Change nature of school	34	28	25	8*				meal (LA) (Treasury alter-				native)   ....	30	45	45	45(e) Reduce school transport pro-				vision (LA)   ....	 	14	13	 -(/) (i) Stabilise the teaching force				at 445,000 by 1980-81 (LA)				(DES option) . or (ii) Reduce    teaching    force	15	55	56	25				earlier to planned 1981-82				level (448,000) (LA) (Treas-				ury alternative)	12	27	16	3(g) No expansion of induction and				in-services training (LA) (Treas-				ury option) after:				(i) 1977-78 ....	8	20	36	36or (ii) 1978-79 .... or (iii) 1979-80	-	8	23	24	-	-	12	12Higher and further education				(h) No expansion in higher educa-				tion numbers (LA and central				government) ....	12	31	43	52(0 Reduce   provision   for   non-				13advanced further education (LA)	8	13	13	(./) (i) Reduce FE building starts				by 50 per cent (LA) (DES				20option)  ....	3	10	18	or (ii) Suspend FE building starts				40(LA) (Treasury alternative)	6	20	36	(k) Reduce provisions for univer-				necessities&apos; furniture and equipment				grant by 50 per cent (central				20government) ....	18	17	19	* The 5p increase is assumed to include the 2p rise in 1981-82postulated in paragraph 15 (b).

This option would not reduce thenumber of places for the under fives but it would preclude such transfers and would end the underfives building programme. It would mainly affectmner city areas.50(b) The effect of (i), reducing basic needs by1 per cent, would be not only to produce over-crowding in areas where new school places are needed, but also require the transport of some pupilsQver greater distances thus increasing transport costs which would reduce the savings attributed tothis option. Its impact would be particularly serious as cost constraints in recent years have led toEductions in the space per pupil provided in newschools.  Suspending special school starts (ii) would^ake it more difficult to provide adequately for thePhysically and mentally handicapped.   To suspend the school improvement starts (iii) after cuts in1976-77 and the suspension of the 1977-78 pro-gramme would mean a standstill for nearly six years in replacing or remodelling the worst of the primary schools: one-fifth of whose places date from beforel903 and suffer from multiple deficiencies. It wouldalso   mean   the   deferment   of   secondary   re-Organisation where this depends on rebuilding. Thenew starts figure underlying these options and0Ption (a) would be (Cmnd. 6721 provision inJackets):1978-79 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82				Under fives .

It would mean a 20 per cent reduction eachyear in costs related to pupil numbers and equip-ment, and worsening the already reduced standards of provision. This option would involve about,000 compulsory redundancies among non-teachingstaff.(d) The departments alternative (i) wouldaccelerate the existing policy of reducing the subsidyby increasing charges to:1978-79 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82September   .      .      .     44p(Compared with the levelsimplied by Cmnd. 6721     39p53p55p50p62p57p)In the face of such steep increases, the assumeddecline in the take-up of school meals would very likely be exceeded, thus reducing the estimatedsavings. In the Treasury&apos;s view the prospectivecharges produced by this option are not credible.The alternative at (ii) would substitute a cold mealall year round in place of the midday dinner.Catering staff might be cut by 30 per cent (butcontracts, compensation and redundancies would affect implementation). Savings at the levels indi-cated would mean reduced nutritional standards.It would probably mark the end of the schoolcatering service in its post-war form. Loss of attracted-tiveness would increase the numbers bringing theirown food.(e) Local education authorities are at presentrequired to provide free transport in cases wherethe pupil&apos;s home is outside the statutory walkingdistance of 2 miles for pupils under 8 and 3 milesfor older pupils. Additionally they have dis-cretionary powers to assist pupils who live justwithin the statutory limit, and others (including
those in further education). This option requires the Government to ask authorities to restrict such provision to the statutory requirements from1979-80 (some two years earlier than under paragraph 15 (b)).(f) The option at (i) would produce a worseningof staffing ratios in 1979-80 on average by about  per cent. Some schools would become difficultto operate and might be forced to restrict theircurriculum. Moreover more than half of the teachers emerging from initial training that year would be unable to find employment in schools.Local authorities could not be expected to co-operatewillingly, either from conviction about educationalstandards or, more pragmatically, because they couldforesee that to do so would provoke industrial action from the teachers&apos; unions on a large scale.Even if they were willing to adopt this policy,authorities would be challenged at every possiblepoint under the existing employment protectionlegislation, and there is no certainty that dis-missals for which notice would have to be givenby May 1978 entailed by a deliberate policy ofworsening staffing standards could in practice beachieved. The pace of rundown under the alter-native at (ii) would be less severe but the accelerateddecline in the size of the teaching force in 1978-79and 1979-80 would exacerbate local educationauthorities&apos; problems in matching demand. Therewould be little scope for making good existingdeficiencies in provision e.g. for shortage subjects and the requirements of disadvantaged pupils.(g) This option is entered at Treasury request.The postponement of induction training and in-service training would reduce employment of qualified teachers, particularly among the newlytrained. The department consider that expandedprovision in this area is essential to an improvementin the quality of education, and that, if undertaken in addition to option (/) (i), the unemployment ofnewly trained teachers would be unacceptable and compulsory redundancies increased.(h) Under this option planned expenditure on higher education would be cut back to existinglevels. The effect would be that about 7,000qualified candidates in 1978 and 8,000 in 1979 some 5 and 6 per cent respectively of the intakes and somewhat smaller numbers in 1980 and 1981would be refused admission. These reductions to-gether with those for 1980-81 and 1981-82 outlined in paragraph 15 (a) would lower the planning figure for higher education places in Great Britain from560,000 to 519,000 in 1981-82, thus halting theexpansion in student numbers.(0 This option would allow an increase of only,000 places in non-advanced further education in1978-79 and 1979-80, compared with an estimatedadditional demand of 16,000 each year. Therewould be correspondingly lower numbers in 1980-81and 1981-82. Such reductions would have serious consequences in relation to youth unemployment:although some 16 year-olds with no jobs mightchoose to stay on at school where there should beplaces available. This would, however, increaserecurrent costs.(j) The effect of reducing further education build-ing starts by 50 per cent (i) would be a shortfall inthe provision of new places to meet the increasing demand from 16 to 18 year-olds for post-schooleducation. The effect of suspending building startscompletely (ii) in the wake of the reduced building programme in 1976-77 and 1977-78 would mean that colleges could not maintain the substantial increase in enrolment of the last two years, par-ticularly for students taking non-advanced full-timeand sandwich courses where the majority are inthe 16 to 19 year-old age group.(k) This option would meet only about a quarterto a half of the University Grants Committee&apos;sassessment of universities&apos; needs. The cumulative effect would be to postpone replacements and improvements over a long period. It would damageboth teaching and the universities&apos; contribution toscientific and technical research.(0 A reduction of some  0-7 million in 1978-79and  1-6 million in each of the subsequent years would result in a slow-down in the British Library&apos;sconservation programme, and entail severe accorn-modation difficulties. The Library&apos;s capacity fofproviding support for other libraries would belimited. It would mean postponing the starting 0^the new building at Euston Road in 1979-80-Further interim accommodation arrangements wouldbe necessary and the cost of efficient operation ofthe national archives would be increased.(m) Reduction of  4-1 million in 1978-79 and 8-2 million in 1979-80 would amount, in each ofthese years, to a real cut-back of some 1^ per cent over the preceding year.   That would result f*

The baseline figures for expenditure by the research councils are as follows:  million1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82248-0	246-8	248-7	246-5	246-533.   The figures for the first two years of the survey period reflect the reductions announced during 1976.   The sharp reduction in the science research Council&apos;s (SRC) support for big science(high energy physics, space science and astronomy)which began in 1974-75 will continue.   In 1981-82total  expenditure  in this  field,  including  inter-national commitments, will be about 25 per centlower than in 1977-78 and domestic expenditure will fall by up to about 50 per cent.   On present plans full implementation of the Northern hemisphere-sphere Observatory project will be deferred until after the end of the survey period.   This cut-backshould make room for some new initiatives in those areas of basic science where the work of research councils underpins such Government priorities asthe exploitation of North Sea oil, the improvementof agricultural productivity, and the training of post-graduate students for careers in industry.  Even so,
the survey limits will not allow the research councils to take full advantage of the opportunities for new initiatives in such areas.ADDITIONAL BID   million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-822-0	7-0	12 0	17-034. Of these sums some  2 million in each year&apos;s  needed to maintain the planned level of activity.The remainder represents a cumulative increase inthe Science Budget of 2 per cent a year. The SRCwould accelerate the expansion in their engineeringprogramme, and they and other councils wouldhave scope for undertaking more research yieldinglong-term economic and social benefits.OPTIONS FOR REDUCTIONS35.   Reductions of 2\ per cent in 1978-79 and 5per cent thereafter would require the followingsavings:  million1978 1979 1980 1981-79     -80     -81      -82(a) Further curtailment of SRCbig science      ...    2        3 3 3(b) Reduction of SRC support for science and engineering,and other research coun-cils&apos; programmes in agri-culture, health and environ-mental research 4       10        9        9Total     ...    6       13       12       1236.   The effect of these reductions would be:(a) SRC big science. There would be further restrictions in SRC support for universities.It would also be impossible to use thefacilities of international organisations to thefull extent of what we are entitled to expectfrom the contributions to which we are com-mitted and the capital expenditure in whichwe have shared. Savings above  3 million could not be made without unacceptable dis-location or the breaching of internationaltreaty obligations.(b) SRC engineering and science and otherresearch councils&apos; programmes. There wouldbe no room for new initiatives; existingactivity would have to be reduced; the pros-pects of redundancies would increase; and support for university research would fall.Even the SRCs engineering programme would have to be curtailed. This would weaken the country&apos;s potential for economicand social advance. Another serious conse-quence would be the risk of permanentemigration of outstanding younger scientists.ARTSIMPLICATIONS OF SURVEY FIGURES37. Apart from making available the additionalmanpower needed for new extensions currentlyunder construction, the planned provision for1978-79 and later years in respect of the nationalmuseums and galleries would do no more thanenable existing policies to be continued. It wouldnot enable much needed maintenance work on existing buildings to be carried out. The capital programme has been substantially reduced from1979-80 onwards.38. The provision for the Arts Council and otherarts will be enhanced by  0-5 million in each yearup to 1979-80 by a transfer from the provision forlibraries. As only  0-2 million will be available from this source in 1980-81 and nothing in 1981-82a further  0-3 million and  0-5 million would berequired in 1980-81 and 1981-82 respectively tomaintain existing policies. Continued restraintwould in the departments view lead to reduced sup-port for regional arts associations and support forany new artistic activity could only be financed bycompensating reductions.39. No specific provisions have been made for possible increases in the final cost of the con-struction of the National Theatre from 1979-80onwards, for implementing public lending right offor introducing Government help for museumschemes of more than local significance.ADDITIONAL BIDSEngland and Wales40.   Additional bids are proposed as follows:(a) National museums and galleries(i)  4-5 million in 1979-80 and subsequent years over and above whatever is allowed in the forthcoming review of annualpurchase grants in aid. The department
10.   Education and Libraries, Science and Artsconsider that this is needed to enable thenational collections to cope with the ex-pected increased availability of nationalheritage objects in the United Kingdom,as a result of capital transfer tax and theincreased attractions to sellers of theinternational market, and(ii)  2-0 million in each year from 1979-80 to restore the level of essential maintenance work on the galleries housing thenational collections.(b) Local museums 0-1 million in 1979-80,  0-3 million in1980-81 and  0-5 million in 1981-82 toenable the area museums councils to expandtheir services, including conservation, to localmuseums.(c) Arts council the department consider  1-1 million is needed from 1979-80 onwards over and aboveany increase needed to maintain existing policies to enable the Council to providegreater support for the development of exist-ing activities; new theatre ventures outside london; the Royal Shakespeare Company&apos;smove to the new theatre in the Barbican; anda higher level of capital grant in aid for theimprovement of facilities, largely to improve the scope for touring by national companies.E  The departments maintain offsetting savingsCannot be found, notably because of the system ofdeficit financing of artists&apos; activities.   If savingsWere imposed this would lead to a reduction inactivity.

The policy options below cover England andWales while those for Scotland are included withinthe education block see paragraphs 31 and 48.A 2\ per cent cut in 1978-79 would yield 2-5 million and the equivalent 5 per cent in later years  5 - 0 million a year. This could be achieved by some combination of the following:  million1979-801978-79 to1981-82Museums and galleries:(a) Shorter opening hours/week-endclosures at national collections 0-6(&apos;)        0-7(l)(b) Reduction in current expendi-ture on local  museums and galleries        ....   0-5 10(c) Reduction in purchase grants for national collections        .      .1-0 1-0Arts:(d) Curtailment of support in the regions.....0-4 0-4(1-4)(-)(e) Reduction in support for national companies .2 0 2 0(4 0)(2)(&apos;) includes  0 1 million and  0-2 million respectively for Wales.(2) for deeper (5 per cent) cuts.England45. A reduction of  2-4 million in the arts andmuseums provision in 1978-79 could, in the depart-menfs view, be obtained by a combination of:shorter opening hours and week-end closures at thenational collections; lower acquisition grants, whichimplies the possible risk of a higher level of exports105
of national heritage objects; a reduction in the arts Council subsidy to the regional arts associa-tions; and withdrawal of support from one majornational company.46. A 5 per cent reduction of  4-8 million from1979-80 onwards would require deeper cuts still;and in the Arts Council view, given they considerthat shading of individual grants would not be a cost effective solution and cause greater damage to artistic standards, would require withdrawal oftheir support from two major national companies(e.g. the Royal Shakespeare Company and covent garden). The Council maintain substantial andsudden reduction of support for any one suchcompany would necessarily render them unviable.In the department^ view a package on these lines would seriously undermine the existing system ofnational support for the arts.   It would rule outgrowth in expenditure on local museums and galleries and bring expenditure on the maintenanceof buildings below an acceptable level.47. With the exception of the reduction in the levelof support to local museums and galleries, theabove options affect central government expenditure and subordinate legislation would not be required.Scotland48. In order to meet the required reductions forthe total education, libraries and arts programme inScotland, one of the Scottish Office policy optionsis to postpone until 1981-82 a start on the con-struction of a building to house the Burrellcollection. The Secretary of State for Scotland hashowever already made a formal offer of grant to Glasgow City District Council towards the cost ofthe building and has agreed to a start in 1978-79.

Off-setting savings of  1-7 million have beenfound in 1977-78 from current expenditure on other health services in England.(b) Current expenditure on the family practitionerservices has been reduced by  5-7 million from 1979-80 onwards as the continuing effectof the December 1976 measures.(c) Transfers have been made to the personal social services programme from employment for costs arising in 1978-79 from regulations made under the Health and Safety at Work etc.Act, 1974 and from the law, order and pro-tective services programme for expenditureon urban aid in England and Wales.&apos;  With these adjustments, the basic survey figureslrnply the following percentage growths:(Per cent)1977-78    1978-79    1979-80J^^rogrammepsf CH current .current (local authority)^ capitaly?Pital (local authority)1-31-81-32-21-9-2-71-32-24-2nilFor the National Health Service, these growth ratestake account of the changing structure of the popu-lation and permit the spread of new methods oftreatment to a limited extent. For the personal social services, they allow for the increasing numbers of children in care but the departmentsconsider that, because of unavoidable increases inunit costs, they are not sufficient both to maintainstandards and allow for the increasing number of people aged over 75. Family practitioner services would generally increase in line with customerdemand and with the numbers of doctors and dentists. Capital expenditure is considerably belowlevels of a few years ago.3. The figures for 1980-81 and 1981-82 arevirtually identical to those for 1979-80, in accord-ance with the decision taken in the 1976 survey and the guidelines for the present survey. Thedepartments consider that this provision implies a significant fall in standards.Additional requirements for the maintenance ofexisting planned standards4. The departments consider that the following provisions are needed in 1980-81 and 1981-82 tomeet an expected increase in demand for the family practitioner services, the additional demand for health and personal social services arising fromdemographic factors and also the growing numberof children in care. For Wales, an additional pro-vision of  1-5 million and  1 -9 million respectivelyis required for 1978-79 and 1979-80 to take accountof a review of needs on the family practitionerservices.
  million	1980-81	1981-82Family practitioner services	39-4	77-8H &amp; CH current expenditure	26-7	57-4Personal social services current expendi-		ture (excluding children&apos;s services)	11-9	24-1Children&apos;s services (growth at 2\ per cent		for children in care)	9-7	19-5Following the last survey, Ministers agreed that the1980-81 figures for health current and personal social services current were subject to increase ifthe demographic projections were confirmed. Thedemographic projections have now been reviseddownwards and the figures in the table, calculated on the latest 1976-based population forecasts,provide just over \ per cent increase on hospital and community health current expenditure and 2 percent for the personal social services, to take accountof demographic factors and the expected rate of increase of children in care.5. The health departments consider that in orderto maintain the standard of services to patients, pro-vision should be made for the expenditure incurred on the May Day holiday and the additional day inleap year, on committees statutorily required underthe Health and Safety at Work etc. Act, 1974 and in implementing the e.c. directives on the trainingof midwives. Current expenditure on hospital and community health services therefore needs toincrease by  11-9 million in 1978-79,  15-4 million in 1979-80,  21-4 million in 1980-81 and 17-8 million in 1981-82.6. Health departments also consider that furthergrowth in health current expenditure is needed totake account of the unplannable costs falling uponthe NHS as advances in medical knowledge lead tothe spread of more modern methods of treatment(including the treatment of conditions previouslyincurable or inoperable). Provision of  20 million in 1980-81 and  40 million in 1981-82 is consideredthe minimum required.7. Capital programmes in both the health and the personal social services programmes have been severely reduced. Old buildings are having to beused for longer than was expected yet much of thehospital bed provision is pre-1900; expenditure on maintaining the capital stock and on equipment isthereby increased. In addition, provision for the care of the elderly is falling behind that requiredto keep pace with demographic increase. Thedepartments   consider  that  additions   of  about 24 million to health capital and about  12 million to personal social services capital expenditure arerequired in 1980-81 and 1981-82. In addition, afurther  1 million in both 1980-81 and 1981-82 is needed in Scotland to provide residential accom-modation in the form of youth treatment centresnow urgently needed for extremely difficult cases which cannot be adequately dealt with in the typeof currently available establishment.8. The departments believe that local authorities will, within their overall expenditure, give higher priority to personal social services than is allowed for in the 1977-78 baseline for these services, andthat this implies increased expenditure in later years. With a 2 per cent annual growth rate fromthe revised baseline, the increase would be:  millio&quot;1978-79       1979-80       1980-81       1981-8222-2_19-2_19-7_20-3___In addition, the departments also believe that pro-vision for a growth rate of 3 per cent per annumfrom 1979-80 would be more realistic. Contri-butory factors include the increase in unit costsreferred to in paragraph 2 and the increasing pressure of demand for community care. The costin 1980-81 and 1981-82 of the additional 1 percent growth would, on the original baseline, be 10-8 million and  22-1 million respectively; onthe revised baseline, a further  0-3 million and  0-7 million will be needed over and above thoseamounts.Additional bids9. The health departments consider that by 1980the effects of severely restricting programmes overseveral years will impose considerable strains uponthe NHS and markedly affect patient care. Capitalstock will be deteriorating or unused because oflack of revenue; general standards will not matchup to international developments; staff trainingmethods (including those for doctors and nurses)will not have been developed in line with modernrequirements. These problems, examples of whichare given in paragraph 12, will have been aggravated by increases in unit costs arising from, for examplefire precautions and implementation of health and safety at work legislation.10. Even more important will be the effect ofincreasing numbers of old people who make more numerous demands on the NHS, particularly those
11.  Health and Personal Social Servicesaged 75 years and over on whom expenditure per head is estimated to be more than seven timesgreater than the 15 to 64 age group and more thantwice as much as for those aged 65 to 74 years. InEngland, for example, the current norm of provision is 28 geriatric beds per 1,000 compared with a1975 figure of 23-7 and an estimated 21-8 by 1986even if current spending plans are fulfilled.   if additional geriatric provision is not made, otherbeds will be used creating blockages and increasedwaiting lists for all groups of the population.  Butquite apart from geriatric provision, old people putParticularly heavy demand on almost all parts ofthe ordinary services, especially hospital medical and surgical facilities.   As a result, the treatmentof old people now forms a noticeably higher pro-Portion of hospital work than used to be the case.The overall effect is a major shift in the nature ofthe NHS, for which the present type and scale of provision is inadequate.U- Priorities will vary throughout the country and departments would not propose to put in specifichids to implement specific parts of the programme.The cost of full implementation would be high; to begin to make an impact would require a growthQf at least 3 per cent per annum in expenditure on health services (excluding the demand-basedfamily practitioner services). In Scotland, becauseof the smaller size of the programmes, they can bemore vulnerable to unforeseen contingencies, e.g.the need which may arise at the State Hospital atCarstairs to make special provision for improvedsecurity following the recent public enquiry.The   examples   given   below   illustrate   thegeneral problems in more detail.A-   Buildings(a) Under -use of new buildings.A number of new capital projects, begunwhen current expenditure on health serviceswas increasing more rapidly than now, will soon be ready to come into commission.These new buildings, built to higher stan-dards and providing better facilities, are more expensive to run. There is evidence thathealth authorities will not be able to make full use of these new buildings without afurther increase in revenue,(k) Increasing age of capital stock.In England, for example, a survey in 1972showed that, despite a substantial building programme since the late 1950s, 65 per cent of hospital floor space was in accommodationbuilt before 1918. Many of the &quot; temporary &quot;hospitals built during the 1939-45 war arestill in existence and essential to the service,but are reaching a stage where the conditionof the fabric and engineering is a cause for concern. A survey of engineering plantrevealed a backlog of replacement work esti-mated by regional works officers to amountto  210 million, whilst the present level ofcapital provision permits very little marginfor new hospital building. This margin willbe eroded as more of the capital has to beused to sustain ageing stock that has not been replaced.B.   Service(c) Overall standards will fall well behind thosein comparable countries.For example, twenty years ago this country had one of the lowest infant mortality rates;now we have fallen behind such countries asSweden, the Netherlands, France, Switzerlandand Japan. Again this country is behindmost European countries in providing carefor chronic renal failure. To bring us into line the numbers of renal dialysis units wouldhave to double, involving an annual cost ofabout  10 million and an initial capital andtraining cost of  25 million.(d) Little progress will be made in preventivemedicine.A screening programme for spina bifida, forexample, would cost about  800 per casediscovered as against the very large costsinvolved in treating and subsequently caringfor these cases. Similarly a screening pro-gramme for mongolism could save more than 1 million per annum. Both these estimatesexclude any savings resulting from the overalldemand on HPSS of the other members ofthe family because of the presence of a handi-capped child. At the other end of the agespectrum,  1 million spent on total hipreplacement for the elderly would preservemobility and reduce the need for long-termcare, perhaps generating an annual return of 0 - 6 million for an average five years in termsof reduced HPSS expenditure.
C.   Training(e) Lack of improvements in staff training.The Government have accepted the recom-mendations in the Briggs Report for a newpattern of nurse training. The pace ofimplementation will depend upon the timing of legislation and the adequacy of resources to make progress in introducing the new arrangements. An additional cost of about 1 million would be incurred immediatelylegislation had been passed: subsequent im-plementation would cost  5-9 million in year1,  10-7 million in year 2, rising to  40million in year 7. Similarly, the MerrisonReport makes important recommendationsconcerning the training of doctors, on whicha start ought to be made in the 1980s, if thereis to be a more co-ordinated programme ofpostgraduate medical education. The costs would be  5-9 million in year 1,  8-2 million in year 2 and  12 million in subsequent years.13. A growth rate of 3 per cent for the health services (excluding family practitioner services)from 1979-80 would permit a modest start on someof these activities. For example, in 1980-81, therewould be an additional  73-8 million which couldpermit:(i) year 1 of the Merrison and Briggs proposals,(ii) the growth of current expenditure onhospital and community health services tobe raised to 1\ per cent, and(iii) an increase of  17 million in the capital programme.In Scotland, like provision would go some way to-wards enabling urgent priorities to be met, such asincreased facilities for the mentally handicappedand for half-way houses for psycho-geriatric cases.14. As regards the personal social services, fivespecific items are identified:(a) promotion of social work training  2-million in 1978-79,  4-4 million in 1979-80and  7 million a year thereafter;(b) implementation of further sections of theChildren Act, 1975- 8-1 million in 1980-81and  9-2 million in 1981-82;(c) costs arising from the regulations under the health and Safety at Work etc. Act, 1974 forsafety   representatives   and   committees  2-2 million a year in 1979-80 and later years;(d) development in Scotland of services for theadult offender, including the community services scheme  1 million in each of1980-81 and 1981-82;(e) running costs of proposed Scottish youthtreatment centres  0-5 million per annumfrom 1981-82.15.

The overall cost could well be of theorder of  17-5 million spread over the years from1980-81 onwards.16. In the Treasury&apos;s view a higher level of localauthority spending on the personal social services in the first two years as well as a growth rate ot1 per cent over and above that required for demo-graphic reasons (see paragraph 8 above) would notbe consistent with the current policy for controllinggrowth of local authority spending, unless therewere compensating savings elsewhere. It should therefore be considered as an additional bid fofresources. As regards the overall growth in healthexpenditure (paragraph 13), in the Treasury&apos;s view this could be modified if implementation of theBriggs and Merrison reports were deferred of savings were made by cutting out expenditure of lower priority.Offsetting savings17. The health departments take the view that thenature of the programme is such that no specific112secret
11.  Health and Personal Social Serviceshems of expenditure can be identified to be cutout in order to accommodate the additional bids.The only way of so doing would be by overallreductions of equivalent amounts which would reduce existing standards or by raising charges (seeParagraph 20).Options for reductions&apos;8. A reduction in expenditure on the health and personal social services of 2\ per cent in 1978-79and 5 per cent thereafter would imply cuts of:  million1978-79        1979-801980-811981-82187380380380such cuts for 1980-81 and 1981-82 were made from a starting point which excluded bids necessaryto maintain standards, they would imply a reduc-tion of 7 per cent from the level of resourcesnecessary to maintain those standards. The health departments therefore consider that those bids for1980-81 and 1981-82 should be incorporated inthe survey figures before cuts are considered.Even so, coming on top of the cuts made in cmnd. 6721, and in Cmnd. 6393 before that, theEductions could only be achieved by drastic measures, including some that might be seen asrepugnant to the basic principles of the NHS. Thescope for increasing charges is considerably reducedby the charges already made, so that almost all ofrhe cuts would fall on services. Important priori-les for relatively deprived services for the mentally ill, the mentally handicapped and thee&apos;derly-would have to be postponed whilstSei vices in the acute sector would be seriouslyrestricted with consequent constraint on the treat-ment that could be provided for individual patients.^- Possible measures that could be consideredn circumstances where there was an overridingused to reduce expenditure are shown in the tableelow and explained briefly in the notes thatlow. Together the measures amount to 2\ per^m of the expenditure in 1978-79 but fall short ofe 5 per cent target for subsequent years by  81^ulion. it must be emphasised however thatUone of these measures is recommended by thedePartmerits.SECRET  million1978-79   1979-80   1980-81onwards(a) Increased charges:Increases in yield from pre-scription charges from April1978 (maximum 50p)Family planning items athalf price from April 1978 .49 049-047-9(6) Cuts in services:Health capital .Health current growth i percent to zeroPersonal social services:CapitalCurrent growth cut to1 per cent per annumCuts in welfare milk .Grand total9	-3	9	-3	9-358	3	58	-3	57-223-	-35	70		7034-	-56	70-	-114	48-11431	2	31	5	31-511	2	24	5	24-54	6	4	6	4-6104-	138	200	6-	178-6-		244	6	244-6162-	196	259-	303	236-302prescription charges21. The net cost of drugs prescribed in the NHScould be reduced by increasing the present 20pprescription charge across the board: the additionalyield from a charge of 40p (less than the real valueof the charge in 1971) would be about  32 million;that from 50p, about  49 million. However, theGovernment has not so far been willing to take this step.family planning items22. A cost-related charge for items supplied underthe family planning service could save  9-3 million.However, if the charges led to no more than anincrease of about 7,000 unintended births a year the savings would disappear.cuts in services23. Overall reductions on the scale indicated inparagraph 12 would make it impossible to main-tain even the reduced &quot; standstill &quot; situation which emerged from Cmnd. 6721. With capital cuts andwith current expenditure frozen or growing at only\ per cent a year health departments considerthat the health services would decline progressivelythroughout the survey period. In such a situation the departments&apos; first aim would be to try tomaintain services for the elderly, mentally ill and113
mentally handicapped. This could only be donehowever by putting the acute services under severeconstraint and measures would be needed to limitexpenditure on new equipment (with serious effects on the industry and its export potential) and to induce reductions in the average length of stay of patients in hospital. The health departmentsbelieve that the result would be greatly extendedwaiting lists and a general decline in standards of care and that hospital closures and staff redundancies-dancies (many in areas already suffering high unemployment) would be unavoidable.24. The capital cuts shown would also have a severe effect. They would require a moratorium onall new capital schemes, including health centreprojects and inner city developments, and restrict-ing capital expenditure to the minimum requiredfor maintenance and for contractual obligations.25. In the personal social services, as already indicated, departments consider that a growth of3 per cent a year is the realistic requirement.There would be serious problems if local authorities were obliged to reduce their capital and current expenditure as shown in the table and to acceptthe political and other consequences of the seriousshortfall in service of all kinds especially thoseneeded for the elderly, for children in care and forthe disabled.26. A small saving could be made by withdrawingwelfare milk benefits from large families not need-ing it on income grounds and by withdrawing the^ pint of milk per child per day supplied free in private day nurseries. The remainder, about  81million, could only be found by reducing current expenditure in absolute terms, with consequentdrastic curtailment of services.

The presentation of the baseline table (part Iof table 12) has been changed this year to bring it into line with that used for the public expenditure white Paper. Expenditure for each benefit in allyears is expressed in terms of the average level ofbenefit during 1977-78 which amounts to assuming that all benefits are increased from year to year atthe same rate as prices increase. On this presenta-tion differences from year to year in the cost of individual benefits reflect changes in the number ofbeneficiaries.2. Expenditure on social security is largely deter-mined by two variable factors: (i) the numberswho qualify for and claim benefit and (ii) the ratesof benefits, and in particular the size of upratingsfor which a minimum is laid down in legislation.Both of these factors are influenced by the courseof the economy. Numbers will be affected by thelevel of unemployment as well as demographicfactors; and the rates of benefit will increase inthe light of the Government^ commitment regard-ing upratings. To provide a basis for these calculations, the Treasury supply the economicassumptions to be used. The figures in part I of table 12 are based on the assumptions providedfor last year&apos;s survey. The line of figures described as &quot; estimating margin &quot; provides for the inevitableuncertainties of the assumptions together with the likely real improvement in benefits, on thoseassumptions, over average 1977-78 benefit levels.The main change authorised since Cmnd. 6721 isthe increased real improvement due to the fact thatthe November 1977 uprating exceeds the movementof prices. Part II of table 12 shows the revisedassumptions provided for this year&apos;s survey andthe total expenditure required to maintain existingplanned standards based upon these assumptionsand other estimating changes.Additional requirements to maintain existingplanned standards3. Legislation requires that national insurancelong-term benefits, i.e. pensions, are increased atleast annually in line with the movement of earningsor prices between upratings, whichever is the higher-while short-term benefits are increased in line with prices. Consolidated Fund benefits are similarlyincreased: it is normal practice for the scale ratesof supplementary benefits to be increased at eachuprating by the same cash amount as the associatednational insurance long-term and short-term benefits. Although the Secretary of State for social services is required to review the rates of childbenefit and mobility allowance annually, the cabinet have not decided on an uprating policy for these benefits. No provision for uprating these benefitsis included in the programme and a real decline intheir value is assumed, as has also been assumedfor the national insurance death and maternitygrants which are not required by legislation to hereviewed.
12.  Social Security4- Child benefit was introduced in April 1977 asa tax-free benefit of  1 a week for the first or onlychild in a family and  1-50 a week for second and subsequent children to replace family allowances.One-parent families receive the child benefit increaseof 50p a week for the first child to maintain thetotal benefit they got with child interim benefit.At the same time part of the child tax allowances(CTAs) was withdrawn and the Government are committed to completing the phasing out of the under 11 CTAs in April 1978 and April 1979.The real improvement of benefits5- The following table shows the cost of the realimprovement in social security benefits after taking account of the new economic assumptions andestimating changes. The comparison is with theaverage levels of benefit in force in 1977-78:  millionLong-term benefits^&quot;t-term benefits .Chf benefit (net of change-over)U,her benefitsTotalCTA1978 -79	1979 -80 -	1980 -81	1981 -82304	411	536	65567	47	37	31-56	-129	-173	-206-2	-5	-7	-9313	324	393	4716- The following factors account for the total netreal improvement in benefits shown above. On the survey assumptions the four upratings from november 1978 onwards will lead to improvementsln the real value of long-term benefits, becauseearnings are expected to increase faster than prices.Moreover, some of the improvement in both longa&quot;d short-term benefits is accounted for by the facttnat the November 1977 uprating is expected to&quot;icrease these benefits by more than the require-ments of the statute dictate, on the basis of the assumed movements of prices and earnings (though these assumptions are subject to significant margins of error). Without provision for uprating childbenefit the real value falls as indicated; and asimilar decline applies to death and maternity^ants. Finally, the major factor in the big^provement in 1978-79 is the sharp decelerationm the rate of inflation assumed in that year com-thePared I&quot;u&apos;lllU11 assumed in tnat year com-the    Wlth 1977-78- which produces an increase incom,!Vera8e real value of benefits in 1978-79 as&quot;Pared with 1977-78.^cretT7.   As already explained, this programme is criti-cally dependent on the assumptions made aboutprices, earnings and the numbers of beneficiaries,particularly  the  unemployed.    Where  these  as-sumptions are changed, as happens every year,this  has  the  effect of  automatically  increasingor  decreasing  forecast  expenditure  as  the  up-ratings are directly tied by legislation to earnings and   prices   movements.    This   year   the   effectof  the  revised  assumptions   is  to  change   thetotal   expenditure   provided   for   in   part  I   ofthe table by the variations  shown in part II.Provision for the additional cost of the November1977 uprating over the amount required by pricemovements is included in part I.   The economicassumption changes in part II therefore take accountof the effect of the new assumptions on subsequentupratings, as well as the effect of revised inflation and unemployment assumptions (and of changesin the provision in the &quot; estimating margin&quot; forthe uncertainty inherent in the assumptions) on thelevel of the programme.   The estimating changesreflect later forecasts of the numbers (other than ofthe unemployed) expected to claim the variousbenefits.Proposals for additional expenditureChild benefit8. The Child Benefit Act, 1975 requires the ratesof child benefit to be reviewed each year and adecision taken on whether or not to increase themhaving regard to the national economic situation as a whole, the general standard of living and such other matters as the Secretary of State thinksrelevant. Now that CTAs are being phased out,increases in family support, which used to comelargely through increases in CTAs, would need tocome through increases in child benefit. such increases would involve an increase in public expenditure and a claim on the contingency reserve.9. The value of family allowances /child benefit and child tax allowances has declined in recentyears. It is now below the levels which appliedduring the present Governments first year of office(1974-75), despite the introduction of the new childbenefit scheme. The department are convinced,therefore, that more resources must be devoted tochild benefit with effect from 6 April 1978. their view is that child benefit should be increased fromthat date to a rate which will be high enough:  
(a) to implement the original intention of the child benefit scheme that the rate for the firstchild should be the same as for other children;and(b) to restore the level of family support for thegreat majority of families to at least the level which applied in 1974 during the presentGovernments first year of office.10. To achieve these objectives, and any con-sequential changes in other benefits, the departmentbelieve that net extra expenditure of at least  320million at 1977 survey prices will be needed in1978-79. (If the &quot;conditional&quot; reduction of thestandard tax rate to 33 per cent takes place, thiswill have the effect of increasing the net cost by  17million.) The figures through the survey periodare as follows:  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82320	290	260	240Extra expenditure of this order would enable the child benefit rate to be increased to  2-50 if under11 CTAs are reduced to  85 or  2-40 if CTAs arereduced to  100. The precise details and a fullerrange of options will be set out in papers for separate consideration by Ministers.11. Mobility allowance, at present  5 a week, willbe uprated to  7 a week in November 1977. Thereis a statutory obligation to review that rate in thefollowing year, but no commitment to linking the allowance to any particular index. The Govern-ment have introduced a policy of phasing-out invalidtricycles (&quot; trikes&quot;) and substituting the cashmobility allowances. This policy has met increasingopposition, on the ground that the allowance,especially after taxation, is nowhere near sufficientto enable new claimants to purchase for themselves the degree of mobility formerly offered by the trike.The department consider therefore that if the policyis to be maintained (and the expense of being forcedto provide cars avoided) the allowance will need tobe substantially increased, so as to bring it some-what nearer the cost of running a car at the presenttime. The proposal is therefore that the allowance should be further increased in April 1978 to  10 aweek and subsequently uprated, but not startinguntil November 1979, in line with the movement of earnings.   The extra cost of this would be:  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-8211	15	18	., 22Pressure for increases in expenditure12. Although no specific bids for extra expendi-ture under this head are being made, it is included,as last year, to give an indication of some of the pressures that are likely to build up for increasedsocial security expenditure. If these pressures arenot resisted any extra expenditure incurred in meeting them would be a claim on the contingency reserve in the absence of offsetting savings.(i) The department are of the view that more generous upratings of national insurance and related benefits are likely than those stipulated-lated by legislation and implied in the expen-diture projections. This would arise becauseof (a) the necessity to announce new rates ofbenefit months ahead of their coming intoeffect based on projections of current trendsof earnings and prices, so that a safetymargin for possible underestimation in thoseprojections might be desirable; and (Wgeneral public pressure for improvements inthe social security benefit rates.(ii) The new pension scheme comes into forcein April 1978 and introductory work is well advanced. In the White Paper on &quot; BetterPensions&quot; (Cmnd. 5713) the government undertook that, with the introduction of thenew scheme, the position of existing pen-sioners would be further reviewed in thelight of the development of the economy-The department foresee that the higher pen-sions paid from April 1979 to those who have contributed to the new scheme will lead to pressure for higher rates for existing pen&apos;sioners, probably through some system ^providing modest &quot; credits &quot;. As in Cmnd-6721, no allowance has been made in theprogramme for the result of this review-(iii) The department consider that the positioncannot be maintained indefinitely of denyingthe unemployed the financial advantage 0^the long-term scale rate of supplementaryallowance. If the long-term rate was madeavailable to all the unemployed after tw&quot;
years the cost would be  22 million a year: 11 million if the extension was restricted to the unemployed over the age of 50; and 6 million if the extension was restricted tothe unemployed with dependent children.Options for reductionsIt is not possible without main legislation tomclude options to reduce expenditure by 2\ percent ( 340 million) in 1978-79, and 5 per cent( 675 million) in later years in the social securityProgramme. The only savings which have been&apos;dentified which would not require main legislationape listed below, but in view of the difficulties experienced recently in attempting to defer the&quot;Production of socially desirable measures or tomake any adverse changes in existing benefits,the department do not consider that either of them could in practice be implemented.DeFERMENT OF THE NEW PENSION SCHEME&apos;4- The new pension scheme is due to start inApril 1978 and improved long-term benefits willbecome payable from April 1979. Deferment ofs major social reform would immediately raise questions about whether the scheme was to be abandoned. If the scheme were to be deferred for0ne year there would be savings of  34 million in1978-79,  31 million in 1979-80,  73 million in1980-81 and  56 million in 1981-82 and staffsavings in excess of 1,000. Whilst in theory the0Ption of deferring the scheme will remain openUntil October 1977, in practice leaflets and instruc-l,ons are already being printed and the effect of deferment on employers who are currently con-sidering whether or not to contract out and arechanging their schemes to comply with the require-ments would be traumatic and lead to generalconfusion. The starting date of 6 April 1978 isspecified in the Social Security (Contributions)(Consequential Amendments) Amendment Regula-tions, 1977 and a revision of these would require an affirmative resolution.REMOVAL OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT FOR THE first six DAYS OF ANY PERIOD OF TEMPORARYSUSPENSION15. Such a measure would necessitate a com-mencement order requiring an affirmative resolu-tion. The saving in benefit expenditure would depend on the number of workers involved andtheir eligibility for unemployment benefit in theabsence of such a measure. The government actuary is unable to give a quantitative estimate,but the saving would probably be within the range of  10 million- 20 million a year. There would inaddition be some administrative savings, possiblyof the order of 150 staff. It would only affect thosestill in jobs.STAFF OF DHSS16. Between April 1977 and April 1982 the non-industrial staff of the department (including thecentral administration of the National health service) will decrease from 92,200 to 90,700. the staffing allowance made for the maintenance ofexisting policies, the increase of work on the newpension scheme and a forecast variation in demanddetermined work has been off-set by the measures required of the department as a contribution towards reducing the cost of the civil service.

This includes payments from the consolidate fund and from Votes for the Queen&apos;s Civil list and other members of the Royal Family, RoyalHousehold and Civil List pensions. The plannedprovision is contained within the limits of theguidelines but further reductions could not beachieved without reducing the scale or style of royal occasions and appearances, contrary to therecommendations of the Select Committee on theCivil List 1971-72.2. The present programme barely maintains theexisting level of essential work for the provision and maintenance of accommodation and services for the Houses of Parliament. For 1977-78 and1978-79 provision has been made for the additionaloffice accommodation for MPs and accommodation for broadcasting as agreed by Ministers. A majorair conditioning scheme has been deferred beyond1981-82 to allow priority for essential and longoverdue modernisation of the heating system &apos;&quot;the Palace of Westminster.3.   There are no bids for additional expenditure.4. Policy options do not exceed  1 million in anyone year.Parliamentary election expenses5. The forecast covers only bye-election expend&apos;&quot;ture and the replacement of election equipment; &apos;1does not include provision for the costs of thegeneral election which must take place not latefthan October 1979. Nor is any provision made ioTthe cost of elections to the European Parliament.ECONOMIC AND FINANCIALADMINISTRATIONTax and rate collectioninland revenue and customs and exciseImplications of survey figures6.   This expenditure consists almost entirely 0^wages and salaries and related administrative costs-
Economies which would lower existing plannedstandards carry the risk of a serious loss of revenue and of damage to the departments&apos; control of taxcollection. The survey figures allow for nochanges in the staffing level or for any increase inthe overall volume of activities during the period.Additional requirements for expenditureINLAND REVENUE7- (a) There are no net additional requirements for the salaries and administrative expenses of thedepartment. There is a need for additional man-Power to deal with rating revaluation and child benefits; basic provision for overtime to be worked in connection with future Budgets has been in-cluded. These commitments however are coveredby manpower savings arising from the 1977budget, further savings in postal costs stemmingfrom rationalisation and economies and by variousnet estimating changes. The overall savings com-Pared with the survey figures are:  millior1979-801980-811981-82-7-5-9-5-9-2(b) Provision is required for the public expen-diture portion of payments for tax relief bydeduction from life assurance premiums.

The cost over the survey period and the cost of replacing existing vessels which cannot be further delayed will amount to 11-6 million. The remainder of the additional requirements relates mainly to replacement andnew telephone exchanges which cannot be avoided;radio equipment for investigation work and revenue control; and agency staff for the phasing inover an extended period of a new computercomplex.9. The Treasury and Civil Service Departmentbelieve the additional expenditure should be met by offsetting savings.SavingsINLAND REVENUE10. The savings achieved by normal administra-tive measures, as noted in paragraph 7 (a), areavailable to set against the new requirements for life assurance premium relief in paragraph 7 (b).Options for reductionsINLAND REVENUE11.   The options for reductions would producesavings of:  million1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-828-6	19-2	19-2	19-2Some of the options included would offer poorvalue for money in terms of the relationship be-tween the staff savings and the loss of revenueinvolved.CUSTOMS AND EXCISE12. Significant economies in addition to the contribution towards the previously announcedsavings cannot be achieved without considerably greater loss of revenue and seriously damagingCustoms and Excise&apos;s capacity to collect revenue and exercise import and export controls. Whatfollows is a number of measures which would haveto be adopted to achieve the 1\ per cent and 5per cent targets. These measures were considered and rejected by Ministers in the context of thepreparation of last year&apos;s proposals to reduce expenditure on the civil service.121180416
1978-79(i) Reductions in the standard of customscontrol of goods and passengers below acertain level could save  0-7 million a year.The loss of revenue and the effect on, forexample, the importation of prohibitedgoods and animals cannot be accuratelyquantified. It is relevant to note that from1 January 1978 customs controls are exer-cised on behalf of the European economic community and any substantive changes will be subject to Community scrutiny andultimate agreement (our controls are already at a lower level than other e.c. countries).(ii) A reduction in the scale of VAT controlvisits by about 20 per cent would save  3-1 million a year. The revenue loss is estimatedat  30 million a year.1979-80 onwardThe measures outlined above plus:(iii) There could be a further reduction in thestandard of control over goods and passen-gers to save an additional  2-3 million ayear. It is questionable whether the remain-ing level of control would be viable. Also,there would be serious difficulties with theCommunity.(iv) Raising the VAT exemption limit to themaximum permitted under the e.c. 6thdirective would save  1 million a yearstarting a year after the introduction of thenew limit; but only if the department weregiven additional powers, which might wellbe controversial, to de-register defaultingtraders below the new limit and EECrequirements did not impose a significantadditional burden. The revenue loss, whichwould start to accrue immediately, is esti-mated at  12 million a year.(v) A consequence of other reductions could provide a further saving of  0-6 million in administrative overheads.DRIVER AND VEHICLE LICENSINGImplication of survey figures13. Driver and vehicle licensing and the collectionof vehicle excise duty are undertaken by the centre at Swansea (DVLC) and its local vehicle licensingoffices (LVLOs), and also by the Post Office andlocal authorities (LTOs) under agency agreements.Most of the expenditure is demand-determined.Additional requirements14. The survey figures, while adequate in other respects, are insufficient to cater for forecast liabilities-ties in respect of the agency services. Ways to meetthe shortfall are under discussion. The additional requirements sought by the Department of Trans-port are:  million1978-791979-801980-811981-820-70-71-21-9Options for reductions15. Within existing legislation governing the licensing, registration and taxation of road vehicles,there is no scope for reductions in the level ofexpenditure.Other financial administrationDEPARTMENT FOR NATIONAL SAVINGSImplications of survey figures16.   This expenditure is largely determined by thestaff needed to administer the existing savingssecurities and by contractual arrangements with thePost Office.Additional bid17. The department claim that the following additional provision is required to cover deferredexpenditure, due to building delays, needed to corn-plete the conversion of the Premium Savings Bondscheme to computer working:  millio&quot;1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82-	0-6	2-3	1-1The department maintain that savings of this ordercould only be achieved by the withdrawal from saleof a major savings security (see also options fotreductions below).18. However, the Civil Service Department andTreasury do not support this bid: they considerthat the required savings could be achieved by thefollowing methods.  First, the postponement of the
BUCKETcomputerisation of savings certificates proposedby the department; second, a modest slowing downin the computerisation of Premium Savings Bonds;third, a reduction in the departments advertisingbudget; and finally, the relinquishment of a &quot; pro-motional force&quot; proposed by the department.These savings, which the department regard as unacceptable, amount to:  million1978-791979-801980-811981-82-1-7-2-5-1-4Options for reductionsl9-  The  illustrative  reductions  would  prodisavings of:-^^^   millionluce1978-791979-801980-811981-820-81-61-71-6The CSD and Treasury consider that a small partof these reductions could be achieved by the savings mentioned in paragraph 18, i.e. by the excess of those savings over the bid in paragraphl7&quot;. and that a further small contribution couldbe made by savings from publicity expenditure, inaddition to those suggested in paragraph 18.   Butthey agree with the department that the remainder,&apos;e- the major part, could only be achieved by thewithdrawal of savings securities.  For example, thewithdrawal of British Savings Bonds and the twoindex-linked securities (SAYE 3rd issue and theNational Savings Certificate Retirement issue) by31  March   1978  would  save   0-7  million  in1978-79 rising to  1-5 million in 1981-82.   Afurther  0-2 million a year could be saved byPolishing the  25 prize on Premium SavingsBonds, leaving  50 as the minimum prize; thisWould increase the odds against winning a prizefrom the present 10,400-1 to 14,000-1.BANK OF ENGLANDl,nPlications of survey figures20- Expenditure by the Bank which falls withinthe survey is in respect of the provision of thefollowing services note issue, debt management,exchange control and the management of the ex-Criange equalisation account.   The level of serviceSECRET18041613.   Other Public services required is in each case largely determined byfactors outside the Bank&apos;s immediate control, suchas:(a) the public demand for bank notes;(b) the Government borrowing requirement andthe obligation to service outstanding debt;(c) the level of activity in the gilt-edged andforeign exchange markets;id) the need to carry out effectively any measuresof exchange control which may be requiredby Government.21. There are some minor additional requirements for expenditure in 1978-79 and 1979-80 due toslippage in the Bank&apos;s capital programme.Options for reductions22. A reduction in note issue costs could beachieved if the number of new notes printed wereto be reduced. This is not recommended sincesuch a course would involve accepting a markeddecline in the overall quality of the notes in cir-speculation below the level of general acceptability.The possibility of a  1 coin remains an option forthe longer term but this would involve increasedshort-term costs.23. As mentioned last year, the possibility ofrelocating most of the debt management work out-side central London is under consideration. this could lead to substantial savings in annual running costs in the long term, though there would be con-siderable once and for all costs during the periodof relocation.24. As regards exchange control, a number of possible relaxations and other technical changes are currently being examined but any consequentialsavings would be marginal.NATIONAL LAND FUND25. Provision is also included in this sub-programme for payments from the National LandFund.ROYAL MINTImplications of survey figures26. Except for 1977-78, where there is additional expenditure of less than  1 million, the forecasts are within the Cmnd. 6721 provision. Percentageoptions would produce amounts of less than  1 million in any one year.123Q2
CENTRAL MANAGEMENT OF THE CIVILSERVICE AND ROYAL COMMISSIONSImplications of survey figures27. This expenditure covers the management func-tions of the Civil Service Department, royal commissions &amp;c, government hospitality, andthe Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. Expen-diture at the level above would enable existing policies to continue but some developments would need to be deferred or abandoned. No additional requirements are foreseen for the maintenance ofexisting planned standards. Percentage options donot exceed  1 million in any one year.BROADCASTING (CAPITAL)Implications of survey figures28. The programme covers the capital expenditureof the BBC Home Service and the IBA, and alsoHome Office expenditure on completing the modernisation of the monitoring station and theprovision for satellite monitoring. The surveyfigures allow for the continuation of the programme at previously planned levels.RECORDS, REGISTRATIONS ANDSURVEYS29. This includes expenditure by several govern-ment departments (the Office of population censuses and Surveys, the General Register Office(Scotland), Land Registry, Ordnance Survey, andother minor departments) and some local authority expenditure. Provision is made under the Officeof Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) for social surveys carried out as an allied service forgovernment departments.Implications of survey figures30. The allocation in Cmnd. 6721 for the Office of population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) and theGeneral Register Office (GRO) (Scotland) included the following provisional estimates of the cost toOPCS and GRO(S) of preparatory work for a 100per cent census of the population in 1981 requiredby e.c. directive (74/403/e.c. of 22 November1973 :  million1978-79    1979-80    1980-81    1981-82OPCS      .      .       0-9 1-5 5-6 5-6GRO(S)   .      .       0-2 0-6 0-8 0-831. It is clear from the level of expenditure in1976-77 that the provision for registration of electors in England and Wales is insufficient tomeet the cost of running the register according to statutory requirements.32. The Goodman CommitteeY proposals, ifimplemented, would place additional functionsupon the Charity Commission which could result inan application for extra manpower and finance.33. Ordnance Survey receipts have fallen moresharply than was forecast in Cmnd. 6721, butadditional savings on expenditure are being made which will ensure that net expenditure is un-changed, declining from  11-8 million in 1977-78to  10-2 million in 1978-79 and subsequent years.Additional or reduced requirements to maintainexisting planned standards34. It is now estimated that the following amend-ments to the provisions in Cmnd. 6721 will berequired to meet expenditure by a number of departments (OPCS; GRO(S); HMSO; PSA; COI;CCA) on the 1981 census designed to meet theminimum e.c. requirements. The new year con-tains census day and covers the peak period ofcensus expenditure.		  million1978-79	1979-80    1980-81    1981-82OPCS      .      .       0-2	-         -0-7        17-7GRO(S)   .      .        -	-           -           2-8	.  35.

Options for reductions36. Reductions of 1\ per cent in 1978-79 and 5Per cent in the following year could produce thefollowing savings:  million1978-79   1979-80   1980-81   1981-82S^SS&amp;GROfS)    .    0-20-50-50-6Any reduction in the allocation for OPCS andGRO(S) would require a decrease in manpower.The option shown would require staff to bereduced by 63 in 1978-79, 99 in the following twoyears and 127 in 1981-82. Percentage options forthe Ordnance Survey produce less than  1 million in any one year.37-  Assuming that additional manpower will be allocated to meet the needs of the 1981 census,the implementation of such reductions to theremainder of their part of this programme wouldmean that the departments would have to curtailQr abandon some of their functions on which thePublic and other government departments rely.   Itwould lead to: reduced quality control of the localmarriage and registration service which in the long-term will involve greater expense; deterioration inthe provision of the birth, death and marriagecertificate and verification service centrally; reduc-tion or elimination of some of the advisory services0n status and freedom to marry; a curtailment ofwork on social and medical statistics jeopardisingcontinuity and comparability; and in the case of0pCS a reduced capability to undertake ad hocsurveys for government departments and the riskof having to cut the sample size on the continuousgeneral household and family expenditure surveysWllh consequent loss of quality.0THER SERVICES38- This provides for a number of minor items.The heading also covers the capital expenditure programme of Cable and Wireless Ltd. which is discussed in the separate report to Ministers on nationalised industry investment and financing.IlnPlications of survey figuresftevolutiionScmT          &quot;---	1977 -78	1978 -79	1979 -80	  million 1980 1981 -81       -82\A,   &apos;and    -Wales	1-1 01	 	-	-        -39.   Following the defeat of the timetable motion on the Scotland and Wales Bill, Ministers decidedthat work on the Royal High School should secure an adequate standard of physical protection for aGrade A listed building, but omit all preparationsspecific to an Assembly use.   In the case of theCardiff Exchange it has been decided not to let the main contracts, but to retain the lease andconfine expenditure to the minimum necessary forthe security and preservation of the building.  the reduced level of expenditure on the Assemblybuildings is well within the provision for such expenditure in Cmnd. 6721 and is the only expen-diture on devolution included in the 1977 survey.All other expenditure is being regarded as a potential claim on the contingency reserve.   It willnot be possible to quantify the amounts involveduntil the future of the Scotland and Wales Billbecomes clearer.Advances to the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation40. It is not possible to predict accurately theamount of exchequer advances which will berequired to enable the Corporation to meet thedemand for loans. Provision of  2 million a year&apos;s  included in the survey but actual requirementsmay vary above or below this figure in any par-ticular year. Any option for savings on theprovision would be less than  1 million.Requirements for additional expenditureCurrent expenditure by local authorities (Scotland)-_   million1978-791979-801980-811981-823-63-63-63-641. Refinements in the classification of expendi-ture returns for local authorities reveal that their expenditure on this programme (which covers ratecollection, valuation for rating, registration of electors, births, deaths and marriages) have beensystematically understated; it is not yet clear howfar this additional expenditure represents a genuinenet addition to public expenditure or how thebalance has been classified in the past but it islikely that much of it has previously been appor-tioned to other programmes as part of the costs of central  administration.    The Scottish Office
accept the obligation to seek compensating adjust-ments in other programmes as soon as more detailed information becomes available later in thepublic expenditure round.Welsh OfFae administration  million1977-78	1978-790-2	0-242. Half of the manpower reductions for welsh office, agreed as a contribution to the cut in civilservice staff, has been postponed until 1979-80 sothat implementation will not adversely affect the government&apos;s plans for devolution. No offsetting savings are identified.Broadcasting43. There is a minor requirement for additional expenditure for extra administrative costs by theHome Office.Options for reductions44. Percentage options for this sub-programmeamount to less than  1 million in any one year.

Withinnew construction, expenditure on dispersal will take an increasing proportion of expenditure.Additional bids2- An additional  3-4 million has been put for-Ward for new works in 1979-80 to sustain the instruction programme at an adequate level tomeet the operational needs of departments and to house staff satisfactorily, particularly the Depart-SECRExment of Health and Social Security (DHSS). the requirement that the total provision for 1979-80should be half-way between 1978-79 and 1980-81has had a particularly severe effect on this pro-gramme because the 1978-79 level was relativelyheavily reduced by the imposition of a 12-monthrather than a 6-month moratorium on starts ofnew construction. Of a total reduction againstCmnd. 6721 of  12 million,  8 million has had tobe found from new works.3. Whilst the Treasury accept that Cmnd. 6721has had a severe effect on the planned construction programme and the imposition of a midpoint figure for 1979-80 creates particular difficulty, the amount available in the survey figures for that year for theprogramme as a whole should, in the Treasury&apos;view, suffice to maintain priority constructionexpenditure without this additional bid.
4. An extra  1-1 million has been submitted forrents in 1979-80. Due to the moratorium and consequent delay in completing new buildings, the timetable for surrendering leased accommodationhas been set back and this, combined with a re-assessment of rent savings in London consequent upon dispersal has increased the rent bill. TheProperty Services Agency (PSA) have been ableto offset the increase in most years, but in 1979-80an increase of  1-1 million over and above the half-way mark, which is  1-8 million below theoriginal provision, is in their view unavoidable.5. The Treasury, however, consider that this isan area of expenditure in which it is possible tomake substantial reductions by deferring newhirings; the amount required is in any case withinthe margin of error of forecasting the requirementtwo financial years ahead.6. An additional  1-2 million a year has beenmade for administration costs from 1979-80 to1981-82 to meet an increased deficit on work forthe United States Forces. In 1971 Ministers agreedthat this programme rather than the Defence Budgetshould bear that part of the costs that cannot be recovered under the international agreement. Thisdeficit has increased from  1 million in 1974-75 to 1-5 million and is forecast to rise to  2-7 millionbecause of the additional work to be carried out.Although PSA have been able to absorb the pastincrease, they consider they cannot absorb thefurther  1-2 million because of increased costs and reduced receipts elsewhere on administration, andthe cuts in other provisions.7. The Treasury point out that inter-departmentaldiscussions are now in progress at official level onthe PSA&apos;s proposal that the Ministerial decisionof 1971 should be changed and that in future this expenditure should be a charge on the defence budget. The Treasury do not consider that adecision can be taken on the additional bid madeby the PSA until their proposal concerning respon-sibility for the expenditure has been settled.Offsetting savings8. If the three additional bids were allowed, thetotal sum required could only be found from withinthe programme by reducing the option cuts belowthe minimum level of 5 per cent for 1979-80,1980-81 and 1981-82.Options for reductions9.  The options would involve cuts as follows:  million1978-79 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82New works   ... 2-4 9-5 9-4      10-3Furniture . . . 1-0 2-0 2-5 1*6Maintenance and running costs .... 3-5 2-8 2-8Transport     ... 0-2 0-4 0-42-80-4Total7-114-7      15-115-110. These reductions would involve loweringstandards of maintenance; deferring replacement offurniture; severely restricting the office improvementprogramme (despite Staff Side feelings on thissubject); deferring local office construction includingfurther integration of DHSS local offices; anddeferring also the Government Conference centre and other major London projects. There would beno provision for new major schemes outside london to provide computer buildings or meet departmentalreorganisation needs (including Inland Revenuemanagement changes). Minor works would be cut,drastically reducing funds available for alterationsand improvements to meet departments&apos; operationalneeds.Stationery and printing (home)Options for reductions11. Departmental demands for Stationery Office(HMSO) services have fallen over the past yearpartly because departments have been pressed to restrict their demands upon HMSO in the interestsof economy, and to enable HMSO to keep within its cash limit. On the assumption that continuingeffort will allow this reduced level of departmentalrequirements to be maintained HMSO are preparedto accept reductions of:  mill&apos;0111978-791979-801980-811981-8280(8-1per cent)10-5(10-3 per cent)9-6(9- per cent)10-6(10- per cent)12. These figures subsume the 2\ per cent and5 per cent options. The run of figures is based 011the currently expected levels of civil service activity-If decisions were taken to reduce those levels thereshould be scope for some consequential addition3&apos;saving on HMSO expenditure.
Computers and telecommunicationsImplications of survey figures13.  The survey figures for computers are, accord-ing to the  Central  Computer Agency&apos;s  (CCA)assessment of departmental requirements, belowthe level necessary to maintain existing govern-ment operations by  amounts  rising  from  over 3-5  million  in   1978-79  to  over  15  million in 1981-82, and amounting to over  30 million inthe period as a whole.   As a result of last year&apos;ssurvey the CCA have been taking steps to extend the life of existing equipment wherever possible andthis year&apos;s figures make allowance for the effects of this; the scope for further deferment of replace-ment systems is thus limited.   The implication isthat by 1979-80 the programme will be unable to accommodate any new projects, even though theyare designed to achieve economies in departmentaloperations and improve efficiency.   Thereafter, itwill be unable to provide all the essential replace-nients of existing systems; this will involve thecontinued use of ageing equipment, and ultimatelyconversion to manual methods might have to becontemplated.   Examples of operations that wouldhe affected are the premium bonds system atLytham, the VAT accounting system at Southendand the payroll centre at Chessington.l4-  For telecommunications, the figures mean that(he CCA could not provide various types of com-munications   facilities   which   are   required   for efficient work by dispersed staff.4dditional bids  million^0niPuters^communications1978-79   1979-80   1980-81   1981-820-20-77010-0An additional bid has been put forward for1978-79 to cover expenditure on computers and telecommunications. The computer item relates toenhancement of an Inland Revenue system, follow-ln8 an agreed change in the basis of local ratingValuation ( 0-2 million). The telecommunicationsltem is the replacement of secure speech telephones( 0-7   -ill&quot;.      -       -million).   To keep within the survey figurese department will have to find savings of over&apos;5 million in 1978-79 and in their view no further&quot;setting savings can be found within the surveyres to meet the sums for which additional bidsnave been made.S CREl14.   Common Services16. The Treasury do not accept on presentevidence that these amounts cannot be absorbed.There is some doubt about the need for anotherInland Revenue item within the programme figures,and in the Treasury&apos;s view there might also be scope for further adjustments of priorities and defermentsto make room for this relatively small extraprovision.17. For 1979-80 CCA propose to meet an esti-mated additional requirement of over  5 million more than is provided in the survey figures by attempting to defer some major computer replace-ments. Thereafter the extra amounts are such that even with the maximum economies they cannot bemet within the survey figures. The additionalbids of  7 million and  10 million for the last twoyears are the minimum amounts required for essen-tial replacements; to maintain existing computeroperations; and for outright purchase of equipment which it was previously assumed would be hired.The increased programme would allow nothing for new projects except in one case where commitmentshave already been entered into.Options for reductions  million1978-79 1979-80 1980-81 1981-82Cancellations and defer-ments of computer and telecommunications pro-jects .      .      .      .1-12-22-22-218. The cuts would have to fall on the purchaseof computer equipment but the basic figures alreadyimply cancellations and deferments which will have serious consequences for government computing.Further cuts would increase the extent to whichessential replacements for existing computer opera-tions could not be provided especially in the later years of the survey.Home publicity19. This covers expenditure on publicity campaignswhich are carried out by the Central Office ofInformation and Scottish Office for other govern-ment departments, and includes the related printingcosts on the HMSO Vote. Publicity is directedprincipally at audiences in the United Kingdomthrough press and television advertising, films,exhibitions and publications in support of depart-mental policies.   The reductions for 1978-79 and129
following years will necessitate economies in all departments&apos; publicity programmes; this includes the major continuing campaigns.Additional bids20. The Department of Energy consider that a sumof  0-9 million in addition to the  1 million ear-marked by COI/HMSO should be spent on a&quot;Save It&quot; campaign in each of the years 1978-79and 1979-80. This is a cost-effective campaign andvital to the energy conservation policy.Options for reductions21. The percentage reductions would mean re-reductions of less than  1 million in any one year.Civil superannuation21. This programme covers expenditure on thepensions, lump sum benefits and other superannua-tion benefits (including transfer payments to other schemes) payable to civil servants and their depen-dants; offset by contributions payable by certainfunds and organisations, by civil servants towardsthe cost of widows&apos; pensions, transfer paymentsreceived from other schemes and certain otherreceipts.22. The 1977-78 figure includes additional Voteexpenditure of  27-3 million, which has beenaccepted by Ministers as a claim on the contingency reserve. This additional expenditure is due to revision of the estimate of the number of retire-ments expected in the year and to increases in theamounts of pensions and lump sum benefits thatwill become payable as a result of last year&apos;s pay increase and of the smaller deductions now needed to meet outstanding widows&apos; pension contributions.It does not include, however, an offsetting increaseof  3-3 million in receipts from the contributionspayable on an accruing liability basis by theNational Insurance Fund and other funds towardsthe cost of the superannuation benefits of the staff engaged in the work of those funds. Nor does itinclude a payment of  3-7 million, which was madeto the Civil Aviation Authority on 7 April onaccount of the transfer of 6,522 civil servants tothe Authority in 1975. Although a payment of 40 million was made in 1975-76 and a furtherpayment of  30 million was made in 1976-77, final agreement on the terms of the settlement was not reached until 15 February 1977 and no provisioncould be made in the 1976 survey or in the 1977-78Estimate for this final payment. The net result isthat a further  0-4 million will be required in1977-78.23. Although it is to be expected that the annualretirement rate will decline in the long term, itseems likely that the present high level of some27,000 new awards a year will continue over thenext few years. The forecasts for the years 1978-79to 1980-81 therefore need to be increased by 25-4 million,  26-4 million and  26-8 million respectively, to produce the following run of figures:  million1977-	-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	300	6	324-1	353-5	384-1	It is assumed that this upward trend in expenditure will continue into 1981-82 and the forecast for thatyear is now  416-5 million.24. No specific provision has been made in theseforecasts for the redundancies or premature retire-ments that could arise from the decision to reduceor restrict the size of the civil service in 1978-79or in respect of the decision to enforce retirementfrom the civil service at age 65 but the assumption of continuation of the present high level of retire-ments can be expected to take some account of the superannuation consequences of these policies.25. In a programme where expenditure is related to the numbers of people eligible for benefits under existing provisions, options for reductions are notpractical. Even if it were possible to reduce thebenefits of the scheme, the reductions could apply only to those who retired in future and the bulkof the expenditure arises from the payment of benefits to people who have already retired or whowill have reserved rights to the existing benefits ofthe scheme.Other common services26. These cover the cost of legal services; theGovernment Actuary and the civil service cateringservices.27. The Treasury Solicitor anticipates that theprovision made to meet the cost of providing leg3&apos;services for other government departments will heinsufficient and has therefore made an additional hidamounting to less than  1 million in any one year28. Similarly, percentage options for reductionsamount to less than  1 million in any one year.130seckE?

Implication of survey figures2. Basically the figures represent little change inthe level of expenditure envisaged in Cmnd. 6721and, in the main, provide for a continuation of services at the standard envisaged in that white paper. Emphasis continues to be placed on employ-ment; on the maintenance of law and order; andon those programmes of social significance such aseducation and health, and particularly on housingwhere there is the greatest need to remedy deficien-cies and improve standards. In education, existinglevels of expenditure are being maintained, whilethe health and personal social services and housing programmes show some growth. The programmeprovides for a house building programme whichwill cater for population changes and additions tothe number of households. It also places a greater emphasis on replacement of unfit houses; on dealingwith overcrowding; on the repair and improvementof older houses; and on arresting the decline of thetwilight areas, particularly in Belfast. In fulfilment of the Governments security policies, the figuresreflect the need to provide for the effectiveness ofthe police in resources and manpower which are essential requirements, as are also the provision ofcellular prison accommodation to replace corn-pounds, and the building of a new prison. Asshown in paragraphs 9-10 in programme 3, reducedrequirements for that part of Northern Irelandagricultural expenditure which is within the controlof the United Kingdom Ministry of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food, have been assimilated to theUnited Kingdom programme as a whole. no additional requirement on a United Kingdom basisarises in respect of this expenditure. It is, however,subject to the uncertainties mentioned in paragraphs and 5 of programme 3.3. The economic situation of Northern Irelandremains very serious. There are (April 1977) over56,000 unemployed, which represents 10-6 per cent of the labour force. The Governmenfs economic strategy is being reviewed in the light of the 1976survey, the Economic and Industrial Strategy for northern Ireland; efforts are being made to con-concentrate more resources in areas of special socialneed.Additional bids4. There are the following additional bids for themaintenance of existing planned programmes and standards:  million	1978	1979	1980	1981	-79	-80	-81	-82Northern   Ireland   depart-				ments   and   Northern				Ireland Office:				Criminal injuries compen-				sation	6-4	6-4	6-4	6-4Employment schemes	14-8	7-6	-	 Security staff grants				scheme	4-5	-		 Redundancy fund   .	11	11	1 -1	1-health and personal social				1-9services	1-5	 	-	Superannuation	 	0-8	1-6	2-3Total Northern Ireland de-				partments and Northern				Ireland Office	28-3	15-9	9- 1	11-7MAFF:				0-4CAP price fixing	0-5	0-5	0-3	Grand total	28-8	16-4	9-4	12-1				_____There are also minor additional requirements of between  1 and  3 million in the years 1978-79 to1981-82.Criminal injuries compensationThe costs of payment for compensation for criminal injuries depend on the incidence and size of claims. Whilst forthcoming legislation should indue course lead to some reduction, the most realisticestimate, based on a reappraisal of the pattern of settlement of outstanding and current claims,coupled with the uncertain level of future violence,justifies the expenditure forecast in the bid.Employment schemesThese schemes provide employment for about ,000 workers and, apart from Enterprise Ulster,are reviewed year by year. Short term prospects of improved regular employment are poor and it isconsidered essential that sufficient funds should beprovided in 1978-79 to enable the bulk of these schemes to be continued for a further year. Fullprovision for Enterprise Ulster which has to plan on a longer time scale, has been extended to1979-80.Security staff grants schemeIt is also appropriate to review expenditure onthe security staff grants scheme year by year, j0the light of the security situation. In presentcircumstances, it is expected that continuation 0^this scheme will be necessary in 1978-79.
Redundancy fund the additional bid for this item results from asubstantial rise in the forecast number of redundancies-dancy payments.Health and personal social servicesProvision for expenditure on health and per-sonal social services reflects demographic and socialfactors, in particular the rising proportion ofelderly people in need of care. Accordingly thisD&apos;d is needed to allow for steady growth over thePeriod to 1981-82.SuperannuationThis is a demand-determined service. the revised estimate takes account of an expected peakln civil service retirements in the next five years,resulting from the level of recruitment in theTnmediate post-war period.CAP price fixingThis additional bid results from the April 1977CAP price fixing round.Social securityAs a result of revised economic assumptions thefollowing additions are required to the social security programme:  million1979-80      1980-81     1981-8212-42-64-5additional expenditure is excluded from thee of bids at the beginning of this paragraph;&quot;either are offsetting savings shown (see paragraph 6).There are the following additional bids for new developments:*----______   million1977 1978 1979 1980 1981-78    -79    -80    -81    -820rt^n   ireland   dments:i0SnlW?&apos;kingParty &apos; &apos;5 45 6 0 6 0 6 0MAFf. mort8aSe scheme. 0-5    10    1-5    2-0A8ricuitural dpifcj grants1-2    0-6    0-5    -TotalTh2-7    5-6    7-5    7-5    8-0 l-o   .fe also a number of minor bids rising tomillion by 1981-82.SIcuEx15.

The estimates of expenditure on the scheme have been based onexperience of take up in Great Britain.Agricultural capital grantsThis is the Northern Ireland share of the cost ofa proposal to end the deferral of agricultural capital grants see paragraph 10 of programme 3.Offsetting savings6. The Treasury point out that there have beenpersistent shortfalls on the Northern Ireland pro-gramme in recent years ranging from  60 million to  90 million between 1974-75 and 1976-77.

Department of Finance agree, therefore, that thereshould be no increase in the baseline figures to accommodate the proposed additions. The follow-ing savings fully offset the main additional bidsfor the maintenance of existing planned pro-grammes and standards detailed in paragraph 4(except social security for revised economic assump-tions) and for new developments detailed inparagraph 5 (except for the Holland report where no offsetting savings have been identified for thecorresponding bid in Great Britain):(see table page 133)Apart from some reductions in housing and education mainly at the beginning of the survey period, and in fuel at the end, the major reductionsare in provision for industrial development. Thisis money that would otherwise have been paidin grants and loans to encourage industrialists toundertake new investment and to create new em-ployment. If efforts to stimulate investment and reduce unemployment prove successful, it will benecessary to restore these allocations. The savings in the law and order field are met mainly from thepolice and prison building programmes. Theadditional bid resulting from the April 1977 CAPprice fixing round is offset by reductions in theUnited Kingdom net contribution to the e.c. setout in paragraph 9(i) of programme 3. The costof the proposal to end the deferral of agriculturalcapital grants (see paragraph 10 of programme 3)can be contained within the United Kingdomreduced requirement. The other additional bidsmentioned in paragraphs 4-5 (except social security and the Holland report) can also be met fromoffsetting savings.Options for reductions7. The total of options at the required level is setout below. The options do not take account of possible changes in the treatment of public cor-porations in public expenditure.  million	1978	-79 1979-80 1980-81 1981	-82Northern Ireland depart-			ments   and   Northern			Ireland Office	42-	5      84-8      85-6      85	5MAFF ....	0-	6       1-2       1-2       1-	0Northern Ireland public expenditure provides fora wide range of social and environmental services.It is also designed to offset severe economic diffi-culties, and to deal with unique problems in maintaining public order. The following analysisshows the effect of the required option cuts. Thefinal form of any reductions would have to beconsidered in the light of reductions required inGreat Britain for comparable services.8. The effect of having to apply the option cutsto the provision for law, order and protectiveservices would be wholly unacceptable. It would entail, for example, reductions in prison staffing,closure of some penal establishments, deferment of essential capital expenditure for the police andprison services, and cuts in Royal Ulster Con-stabulary target strengths. Consequently, if optioncuts had to be made in the total Northern Irelandprogramme they would have to be taken entirely from social, environmental and economic expendi-ture programmes, which are in turn part of theGovernments response to the situation in NorthernIreland. The largest such expenditure programmerelates to social security in which exact parity ismaintained with Great Britain. Reductions init would have exceptionally severe consequences,because Northern Ireland have the highest unem-ployment rate and the lowest average personalincome of any United Kingdom region. Theother major programmes relate to healthandpersonal social services, education, libraries andarts, and housing. The option cuts would create a marked falling trend in health expenditure,even though demographic and other factorsrequire such expenditure to increase. their main effect on education would be to cut backheavily on all capital programmes (including thosein areas of special social need) but there wouldalso be serious implications for the future levels of employment of teachers in schools and insti-tutions of further education. In addition, few 01the other education services could remain at then&quot;present levels if the full reductions were imposed-The effect on housing would be, for example, t0require substantial rent increases beyond those already planned and reduced expenditure 00rehabilitation.9. The options for expenditure on NorthernIreland agricultural services by the UniteC*Kingdom Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and food would be determined in the light 0^agricultural policy for the United Kingdom as 3whole.
SECRET-------_______ Supplementary Analysis ACurrent expenditure  - Table A 1 brings together from the individualtables in Part 2 figures for total local authoritycurrent expenditure in survey terms in England andWales and in Scotland. It also shows the adjust-&quot;lents which are necessary to move from current expenditure on the survey basis to relevant expendi-ture as defined for rate support grant (RSG)Purposes. These adjustments are shown separatelyby programme in tables A2 and A3.2- As the table shows, the very rapid rate of growth in the early 1970s was sharply reduced in1975-76 and 1976-77. For the future years of the survey period, the table repeats the Cmnd. 6721Provision for a broad stability of expenditure.3- Figures for 1974-75 and earlier years are out-turn figures and those for 1975-76 near finaloutturn figures. For 1976-77 the estimates for england and Wales are based as far as possible onthe provisional outturn figures in the recently received DOE/CIPFA returns of expenditure and rates, which broadly confirm the size of the over-sPend last year at about the same level as thatSUPPLEMENTARY ANALYSESLocal authority current and capital expenditurepostulated in the 1977-78 settlement. The budget estimates for 1977-78 contained in the same returnsimply a further overspend of around  50 million.This has not been included in the figures for thecurrent year in tables Al and A2, which assume that local authorities keep their expenditure to therate support grant level. In the past actual expen-diture has tended to fall somewhat short of budgetplans. But it is not known whether this experience is likely to be repeated in 1977-78. Budgetestimate returns in Scotland imply planned expen-diture there very close in total to that postulatedin the settlement.4. The projections of local authority current expenditure for the later years of the survey periodhave been prepared by departments in the light ofthe guidelines. The implications for the mainlocal authority services of holding expenditure tothese levels are described in the programmechapters of Part 2.

For England and Wales the reductions shown for housing reflect the effect of lower interest rateassumptions on housing revenue accounts. the apportionment of these effects between savings inrate fund contributions (which are what are scoredabove) and in central government subsidies is onlyapproximate. For other services the additionalbids show the extent to which, in the view of departments, the baseline figures need to beincreased as follows:(i) For transport the bids are mainly theamounts which the department expect to berequired on grounds of realism for localtransport subsidies after allowing for off-setting savings within local transport, someof which may, in the event, fall on capitalexpenditure.(ii) For other environmental services they are almost entirely the departments estimates ofthe extent to which, in the light of experienceof recent years, local authorities will find itnecessary to incur expenditure in order tomaintain existing levels of service in areas where, although the central government doesnot lay down minimum standards of service,nevertheless there are inescapable commit-ments, e.g. for refuse disposal. The minorexception is the provision of  2-5 million ayear from 1979-80 onwards to meet the costof safety representatives and committeesunder the Health and Safety at Work etc.Act, 1974 which is a new development.(iii) Law, order and protective services were left,in the view of the Home Office, with in-sufficient resources as a result of previouspublic expenditure decisions to maintainexisting standards from 1978-79 onwards.The bids reflect this and are almost entirelyestimating changes caused by revised fore-casts, notably of the cost of police pensionsas a result of a changed view of the numberof early retirements. Again the exception isthe Health and Safety at Work etc. Act, 1974( 3 million a year).(iv) For education, apart from  14 million in1980-81 and  62-5 million in 1981-82 tomeet the cost of continuing existing policies,the bids are entirely in respect of new developments including the Health and safety at Work etc. Act, 1974 (for details seeparagraph 25 in programme 10).(v) Finally, of the additional bids for the personal social services,  2 million in1978-79,  4 million in 1979-80,  14 million in 1980-81 and  15 million in 1981-82 arein respect of new developments (including 2 million a year from 1979-80 onwards forthe Health and Safety at Work etc. Act&apos;1974). The remainder includes  19 million in1980-81 and  39 million in 1981-82 to allow for demographic factors in maintaining exist-ing standards and a further allowance of 20 million in 1978-79 rising to  38 millioDin 1981-82 to reflect what the health depart-ments regard as a realistic forecast of theextent to which expenditure by loca^authorities is likely to exceed that otherwise provided for.6. As to the realism of the total baseline figureSfor England and Wales, it is always difficult toprovide a reliable assessment. Policies andpressures designed to restrain the level of loc3^
Supplementary Analysis Aauthority current expenditure have been remark-ably (even if not wholly) successful in recent years;and it may be that even the prospective excess of 50 million in 1977-78 will be avoided. But theGovernments ability to influence the level of localauthority current expenditure can vary withchanging circumstances, and an important point to hear in mind in making any forward assessmentnow is that the Government may be operating against the background of a return to 2 per cent ayear growth in public expenditure generally.7- Against that background, and even assuming that there is no overspending in 1977-78, it must beconsidered whether it is realistic to envisage thattotal relevant expenditure will fall by around 1 percent between 1977-78 and 1978-79 and be held ata reduced level for the following three years-asimplied by the baseline figures. Moreover, exami-nation of the prospects for individual services showsthat there will be strong pressures for higher levels01 expenditure.8- On the other hand, there is evidence of a newrealism abroad in local government about the effects01 expenditure decisions on rate poundages and a^cognition that the Government will not necessarilymcrease its grants to local authorities in order totake away the burden of rate increases. past experience suggests also that it can take some timeI0r changing government attitudes to the growth ofpublic expenditure to be fully reflected in localauthority attitudes. It may be therefore that theco-operation which local authorities have alreadyshown in reducing their expenditure will still be inevidence over the next two to three years in spite01 an increase in public expenditure generally.9- Taking these considerations into account, thedepartments responsible for the main local authority services in England and Wales are agreed that itwould not be unrealistic for the Government toP&apos;an for total relevant expenditure in 1978-79 andl9?9-80 at the levels implied by the baseline&quot;figures. Nevertheless, in order to ensure that expenditure levels are held, it would be necessaryt0r the Government to maintain a strict line on expenditure and, above all, not to accede to rate support grant settlements which remove from theratepayer the burden of rate increases needed tomeet additional expenditure. Looking furtherahead, however, to 1980-81 and 1981-82, depart-ments are agreed that, particularly in view of theSECRETstrong pressures within individual programmes, itwould be unrealistic to assume that total expendi-ture could continue to be held at the baseline level.10.   The main additional bids for Scotland reflect the following views of the Scottish Office. The addi-tion for other environmental services is primarilyan adjustment to bring the survey provision into line with probable expenditure levels after taking into account substantial reductions (e.g. in leisureand recreation provision) to a level which localauthorities are unlikely to be able to reduce further.Even with the additional bid, local authorities willhave to adhere to the severe cuts in expenditureinitiated in 1976-77, in particular in order to meetthe revenue consequences of projects under con-struction.   For education and libraries additionalbids have been proposed, partly to secure themaintenance of existing policies against the dis-economies  resulting  from  the  decline  in  pupilpopulation, and partly to secure improvements in standards, with particular reference to areas of social deprivation.11. In Scotland, present indications are that totalrelevant expenditure in 1977-78 will be consistent with the survey figures. In the Treasury&apos;s view, thissuggests a similar assessment of the realism of thetotal baseline figures for future years as for Englandand Wales (paragraph 9 above). The scottish office agree that it would be unrealistic to assume that total relevant expenditure could be held at the levels implied by the baseline figures for 1980-81and 1981-82. They envisage that some transfersfrom capital may be appropriate in 1978-79 and1979-80; but they consider that since the scope forthis is limited there will be acute difficulty in meeting the baseline figures for those years also.Discussion with local authority associations12. Arrangements begun last year to involve thelocal authorities in England and Wales more fully in the public expenditure survey process are being continued this year. These involve the considera-tion by joint groups of central and local government officials of the implications for local authority ser-vices of the figures for future years in the public expenditure White Paper published last February(Cmnd. 6721) and the possible application of illus-trative cuts of 2\ per cent in 1978-79 and 5 per centin 1979-80 and later years, as required for all pro-grammes by the survey guidelines.   The results of
this work, both for 1978-79 and for later years,will be discussed by the Consultative Council on local Government Finance in July. At that stageit may be possible to make a better assessment ofthe possibilities of holding to the survey figures for later years. In Scotland similar discussions arebeing held with the Convention of Scottish LocalAuthorities.The financing of relevant expenditure13. With the volume of expenditure growingstrongly throughout the period, and a rapid rate of inflation, relevant expenditure in Great Britain asa whole grew very substantially in cash terms from 5,300 million in 1972-73 to  12,830 million in1976-77. There is no change in volume terms in1977-78. But in cash terms there is a further increase of 9\ per cent to  14,070 million. Rateshave slightly more than doubled over the period covered by table A5, from  2,415 million to 5,170 million, an increase which is almost exactlyin line with the forecast rise in the retail price index.Despite the fall in grant percentages in 1976-77 and1977-78, the burden of financing the increase inthe volume of expenditure has fallen entirely onthe aggregate exchequer grants, which consequentlyalmost trebled from  3,200 million in 1972-73 toan anticipated  8,740 million in 1977-78. the table below shows aggregate exchequer grants asa percentage of the approved level of relevant expenditure for the years covered by the table:England and Wales Scotland1972-73   .       58 66i1973-74   .       60 681974-75   .       60i (4-special) 68 (-f- special provision = 65 \) provision = 71)1975-76   .       66i 751976-77   .       65* 72*1977-78   .       61 68i14. For 1972-73 to 1975-76 the estimates used intable A5 have been obtained from returns madeby departments, from estimates made by theDepartment of the Environment and the scottish office, from local government financial statistics(for the first two years only) and from other pub-lished sources. In principle the differences betweenincome and expenditure should be identical toreported changes in local authority balances. Butthe figures shown for England and Wales in line 15in the table also appear to reflect some small dis-crepancies between the sources of the variousestimates which it has not been possible to resolve.15. The estimates of expenditure and income for1977-78 are the settlement figures, revalued to1977-78 outturn prices using the assumptions aboutinflation underlying the cash limit and assuming that the additional amounts payable in respect ofloan charges and specific grants which are ex-cluded from the cash limits will conform to theestimates made when the cash limits were announced. If inflation proves to be higher thanassumed for cash limits (and local authorities donot make corresponding reductions in their current expenditure in volume terms) or if current expendi-ture in volume terms is more than was accepted in the settlement, the estimated deficit of incomeover expenditure for England and Wales( 110 million) will be greater, and the estimatedsurplus of income over expenditure in Scotland( 11 million) will be reduced or turned into a deficit. The DOE/CIPFA returns suggest that inEngland and Wales authorities have provided both for an additional volume of current expenditure andfor additional inflation thereon ( 50 million onthe first count and  100 million on the second).Capital expenditure16. Table A 6 brings together the figures for localauthority capital expenditure. The profile showsvery clearly the effects of the cuts affecting 1977-78and 1978-79 announced last December, with sub-stantial falls in both years following the alreadylarge reductions made in 1976-77. There is somerecovery in 1979-80 and 1980-81. But, even so, by1981-82 capital expenditure in Great Britain as awhole is equivalent to only 61 per cent of its peaklevel in 1974-75. This substantial fall has resultedpartly from bringing housing capital expenditure under better control and partly from the decision that, because it was impracticable to cut current expenditure, all reductions on local authority ex-penditure had to fall on capital. The estimates for future years do not reflect a considered viewof what would be the best balance between current and capital spending.17. In England and Wales total provision fal&apos;from  4,816 million in 1974-75 to  2,546 milli011in 1978-79, a fall of 47 per cent, before rising t0 2,789 million in 1981-82. The only substantialprogramme not showing a fall over this period lSkey sector expenditure on other environmental services.   This is because of the effect of the

D.   Employment and training measures1. Since the 1975 Budget the Government have introduced a series of temporary measures to mitigated-gate the worst effects of high unemployment,especially for hard-hit groups such as young people.These measures are aimed at maintaining and improving the level of training, particularly inskilled trades; assisting firms to retain employees;providing recruitment subsidies; and giving unem-ployed people temporary jobs and work experience.The resources made available for the various schemes are shown in the following table:  million	Scheme operative	Closing date for application	Termination of scheme	1975-76	At outturn and 1977 survey price 1976-77    1977-78     1978-79		Job creation programme .

It also includes the in&apos;1provision for improving training allowances and ETS grants but does not reflect any continuing effect of those improvements,table does not include measures administered by other departments, e.g. schemes to assist the construction industry and indusschemes generally.)2. Consideration is now being given to proposalsfor a continuing programme intended mainly toreplace the work experience and job creation pro-grammes.   They would roughly double the pro-vision for young people and come fully into effeCby 1 September 1978, after a build-up over t epreceding 12 months.secret

Extensions of the current terminal dates of the job release scheme (30 June 1977) and the youthemployment subsidy (31 August 1977) are underdiscussion. The future use of incentive traininggrants is also being considered, but any costs arisingfrom proposals in this field may be met to alarge extent by existing provisions.4. In the case of most of these measures, the netcosts are likely to be substantially less than the gross costs because of the savings on unemployment and supplementary benefit, and the maintenance of tax and national insurance flows. It is difficult tomake an accurate assessment of such savings as there will be possible displacement and sub-stitution effects with some of the schemes, and because benefits payable vary according to the age and responsibility of claimants. At the same time there is some saving on redundancy payments.
E.   The Urban ProgrammeBackground1. Following the review of inner city problemsinitiated by the Prime Minister, the Secretary ofState for the Environment announced on 6 Aprilthat the Government had decided to recast the urban programme to cover economic and environ-mental as well as social projects, and to increase it.He said that a large measure of priority would begiven in the early years to the regeneration of the inner areas of the major cities, but that other citiesand towns would have access to it on an increasingscale in later years.2. The enlarged urban programme-responsibilityfor which in England and Wales has been trans-ferred from the Home Office to Department of the environment and Welsh Office is an additional programme of current and capital expenditure bylocal authorities (operating sometimes throughvoluntary bodies). In the past it has supportedprojects mainly in the fields of education, personal social services and housing. The scope is now tobe widened to include industrial, environmental and recreational provision.3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced inhis Budget statement that  100 million (at 1977-78outturn prices  92 million at 1977 survey prices)would be made available for construction works ininner cities in the United Kingdom during 1977-78and 1978-79. The Secretary of State for the environment said in the House on 6 April thatthe urban programme in England and wales would be expanded from its present level of about 30 million to  125 million (at 1977-78 outturn prices  115 million at 1977 survey prices) by1979-80. Ministers have agreed that this increase should be found from savings in the new townsprogramme, from savings on existing localauthority expenditure programmes and through alimited provision of additional resources. Also on6 April the Secretary of State for Scotland an-nounced an expansion of the urban programme in Scotland to over  20 million by 1980-81. this increase also will be largely met by savings inother programmes.152england and walesComposition of urban programme resources4. Table E 1 below shows the composition of theresources which are to be devoted to the expandedurban programme. Until this year the urban programme has been shown as part of programme  (law, order and protective services) but with thetransfer of responsibility to the Secretary of Statefor the Environment the central element of theexpenditure arising in England and Wales is nowshown in programme 8 (other environmental services). Other elements of expenditure are beingretained in the appropriate functional programmes-Use of resources5. Resources under the expanded urban prc&quot;gramme may be put to a variety of uses. Thiswill depend on the bids for urban aid contained inthe inner area programmes to be prepared byselected (partnership) local authorities, and whichwill be approved by the Government, together withother bids from the other local authorities withurban problems. So far as education, social services and transport provision is concerned lJwill also depend on the availability of resources inthe functional programmes. At this stage it lSenvisaged that projects will include educational and social service projects, hostels, and communitycentres, as in the existing urban programme, hutthey could also extend to include such projectsas preparation of sites for industry, environmentalimprovement, transport and traffic projects, recreational-tional schemes, work on waste and neglected land and careers advisory schemes. This is illustrativeof the new dimension the Government want to giyeto the urban programme, recognising the overalleconomic and environmental problems of the innefcity areas.6. The precise allocation of resources to differentlocal authorities cannot yet be made.

Ministers intend thatoutside these areas the total provision should beon an increased scale in the later years.SCOTLAND7. Since 1975 greater priority has been given tothe problems of urban areas within Scottish Officeprogrammes. In 1976 a joint scheme withStrathclyde Regional Council, Glasgow DistrictCouncil, the Scottish Development Agency and theScottish Special Housing Association for the com-prehensive renewal of the east end of Glasgowwas announced. Last year also provision for the urban programme in Scotland was augmented bytransfers from other Scottish Office programmes.8. On 6 April the Secretary of State for Scotlandannounced a major expansion of the resources available under the urban programme on the basisof Ministerial decisions. The urban programme would be built up from a present level of  6 milhorlper annum (at 1977-78 outturn prices  5&apos;million at 1977 survey prices) to over  20 rnilh011by 1980-81 ( 19-8 million at 1977 survey prices)-Part of the increase was to be provided from tnecontingency reserve and the remainder from savings on other Scottish Office programmes. The addi&quot;tional resources so provided would be deployed on major rehabilitation projects in large areas of urbandeprivation in co-ordination with local authoriti6^but assistance would still be continued for the kmof individual project traditionally assisted under tb6programme. In addition, Scotland&apos;s share of &amp;epackage announced in the Budget statement, &apos; 10 million ( 9-2 million at 1977 survey prices) Isbeing provided for additional construction work &amp;inner city areas during 1977-78 and 1978-79.154secret
Composition of urban programme -  The urban programme in Scotland will con-tinue to be co-ordinated by the urban renewal unit of the Scottish Development Department.  Theanlysis which follows is illustrative because respon-ses have not yet been received from the local andother authorities invited to put forward schemes under the  construction package.    Major  com-Prehensive schemes to give effect to the announce-ment of 6 April will have to be worked out withthe local authorities.  Questions still to be decidedare whether the expenditure under the programme should be allocated to a single public expendituresub-programme or among the various functionalsub-programmes relating to the services concerned,and where the offsetting savings are to be made.Meantimeexisting provision for the urban pro-gramme in programme 9 (law, order and protectiveservices), together with the provision for the con-struction package, are shown under programme 8(other environmental services). In addition to theexpenditure shown in the following analysis, it isproposed in paragraph 26 of programme 10 that within the education programme  4 million a year should be allocated for the employment ofadditional teachers in areas of social deprivation.Use of resources10. The greatest incidence of urban problems is in glasgow, but the resources will be used to dealwith urban problems generally. The balance ofexpenditure between services will reflect the differ-ing needs of particular areas selected for a comprehensive approach. Particular emphasis willbe given to encouraging local initiatives within thecommunity.

SECRET---____ Supplementary Analysis FF.   The Construction industry the present position- Output in the construction industry has fallen20 per cent from its peak in the winter of 1972-73.Margins on tender prices appear to have been fallingand to be very tight now. Employment in theindustry is now about 1,630,000-300,000 below the1973 peak. Unemployment in February was run-nmg at 215,000 (seasonally adjusted) equivalentto 15 per cent of the labour force, higher than inany other industry, and is 17 per cent of totalunemployment.2- Although employment has fallen sharply, pro-productivity is well over 10 per cent below its peak of 1972. Thus there is under-employment and, inthe absence of any recovery in demand, employersmay further reduce their labour forces so cuttingtne present spare capacity. Any recovery in output would not immediately increase employment but would first raise productivity.The immediate prospectJ- Total new orders rose slightly (5 per cent) in1976 but remained nearly 25 per cent below the1972 peak. Orders for private industrial and com-mercial construction started an upward trend at thebeginning of 1976, which is expected to continue,however the industry&apos;s prospect of further recoveryln total orders this year was eliminated by theecember 1976 measures, including the moratorium0n some public sector programmes, which, with the^ly 1976 measures, cut planned construction expen-diture in 1977-78 and 1978-79 by  1,000 million.^ Output in 1977-78 is therefore expected to bePer cent lower than in 1976-77, the sharp fall in public sector more than off-setting the recoverywhich is expected to begin in the private sector,ere should be a slight improvement (perhaps0r 2 per cent) in 1978-79.^ Employment is expected to fall another 100,000y the end of 1978 as much through adjustment toe Present level of output as to the further fall,&quot;employment is expected to rise to about 300,000.The future prospect: 1979-80 and beyond6. Private sector demand should build as the economy strengthens. Unless interest rates haveto be put up sharply, the flow of mortgage money should support some growth in private sectorhouse-building. Commercial development isexpected to rise 15 per cent or a little more, whilethe rise in investment in industrial building couldbe as much as 40 per cent. By 1979-80 total output for the private sector is forecast to be 10 to20 per cent higher than in 1976-77.7. In contrast, present public sector forecasts shownew housing and works each declining 14 per cent from 1976-77 to 1979-80. Allowing for a marginalincrease in repairs and maintenance, total public sector output is expected to fall 10 per cent duringthe three-year period.8. Combining the two sectors, construction output in 1979-80 should be no less than last year and could rise by up to 5 per cent. This would mean that after the expected fall in output in 1977-78and the slight recovery in 1978-79 output shouldbe on a gently upward trend. Because of thepresent spare capacity, growth of 5 per cent couldbe wholly absorbed by improved productivity;therefore employment cannot be expected toincrease during the coming three years.9. Civil engineering, nearly all of which is publiclyfinanced, was particularly hard-hit by the cutsannounced in 1976 and prospects for this section ofthe industry in the two years are extremely bleak.The forecast recovery of civil engineering in1979-80 back to the 1976-77 level largely stemsfrom rises in the investment programmes of water authorities, the British Gas Corporation and theBritish National Oil Corporation (BNOC) whoseinvestment forms a substantial proportion of newcivil engineering output.10. Prospects after 1979-80 are even more un-certain. However, the likelihood is that construc-tion for public sector clients will expand gradually,while output for the private sector will continue to grow although at a slower rate than in the previousthree years.157

1977 PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEYMAIN REPORTIntroductionThe purpose of this report is to provide the basic material on which ministers will take decisions in the 1977 public expenditure survey.2. The report has been drawn up in accordance with the instruc-tions approved by Cabinet in March (reproduced at Annex 9). Thegeneral principle of these ground rules was that the figures includedin the report are derived from the expenditure plans already approved. Any proposals for additional expenditure for whateverreason are separately identified for Ministerial decision before they can be incorporated in the plans. Where additions are pro-posed, departments were asked to indicate how, if necessary, theycould be absorbed within the programme. In order to enable ministers to consider different choices, and priorities, departments were also asked to identify further options for reductions, amountingto 2\ per cent in 1978-79 and 5 per cent in later years.3.   Thus the report contains three basic components:(i) the &quot; baseline &quot; levels of spending for each programme;(ii) proposals for additional expenditure;(iii) options for reductions.4. The &quot; baseline &quot; is meant to provide a convenient benchmarkfrom which all subsequent decisions can be measured. For1977-78 and 1978-79, it reflects the expenditure plans in Cmnd.6721, which also underlay the Chancellor^ letter of 15 December1976 to the International Monetary Fund. The figures have how-ever been adjusted to take account of Ministerial decisions to commit the contingency reserve since Cmnd. 6721 was published;and the figures for the contingency reserve have been correspond-ingly adjusted downwards. The figures for the nationalised industries have also been adjusted in the light of a preliminaryappraisal of the separate review of their investment and financingrequirements see paragraphs 10-12 below.5. For the later years, the Cabinet agreed that the baseline for1980-81 should be similarly derived from the Cmnd. 6721 figures.There was however a problem about the intervening year, 1979-80,
which showed a sharp increase over 1978-79 (which had been affected by the December 1976 cuts). The guidelines therefore pro-vided for this to be treated as a transitional year, and for a suitablepath to be constructed between 1978-79 and 1980-81. Finally, for1981-82, which is covered by the present survey but was not covered by Cmnd. 6721, the guidelines provided generally forthe 1980-81 figures to be repeated, leaving Ministers to decide whichprogrammes should share in the available growth in that year.6. The fact that the baseline figures have been constructed in thisway means that they do not, by themselves, indicate any major problem (except to the extent that the contingency reserve has been drawn down by past decisions). The issues for decision are drawnout in the various additional proposals. These are of different kinds. First, there are estimating changes in demand-determinedservices which the Government is obliged to provide under existing law. These changes may be upwards or downwards, and in either case are listed with the additional proposals for their respectiveprogrammes: they are however always liable to further change as new information comes in. Second, there are other additional requirements for the maintenance of existing planned standards.Third, there are proposals for new developments. However, theinclusion in this report of proposed additional expenditure, or ofoptions for reductions, does not carry with it any presumption thatthey will be implemented: this is the essential issue for ministers to decide on the survey.7. The detailed analysis of programmes under the headings in-dicated above is set out in the programme chapters in Part two ofthis report. The remaining sections and annexes of this main reportsummarise the results and seek to clarify the main issues which ministers have to decide.SECRET

The figures given in volume 2 for individual programmes in later years were more provisional than usual, since they had not been reviewed in thelight of the developments leading up to the Chancellor of the Exchequers statement on 15 December 1976.Baseline8. The baseline figures emerging from the new survey are shownin table 1.9. It is assumed that Ministers will want to maintain a contingency reserve in the current survey of a broadly similar magnitude to that adopted for the corresponding years in other recent surveys. Thefigures shown in table 1 for 1979-80 and subsequent years reflectthat assumption. For 1977-78 and 1978-79, the figures are simplythe uncommitted balances of the contingency reserves with whichwe are already operating for those years. The resulting level ofthe reserve in 1978-79  659 million is rather low by paststandards, and it would seem desirable to reconstitute it to a level
SECRET Main Reportof around  900 million. This would mean finding room for a claim of some  241 million.10. As table 1 shows, the baseline figures rise rather sharply in1979-80. This is partly due to a jump in government lending tothe nationalised industries. Table 2 gives the relevant figures. Theindustries are due to repay large amounts of foreign currencyborrowing and market stock in 1979-80 and subsequent years (table2, line 1). To finance these repayments, they will need to increase their borrowing from the Government in 1979-80 (line 2) eventhough their total borrowing requirement (line 3) is projected to fall in that year.TABLE 21977	1978	1979	1980-78	-79	-80	-81685	65	-886	-496664	1,072	1,939	1,8191,349	1,137	1,053	1,3231981-821.

The increase in government lending to the nationalised industries which results from the need to repay market and foreign currency debt is large enough to affect the baseline series in table1 significantly. In the Cabinet discussion in March, it was suggestedthat it would be unreasonable to allow this special factor to distortdecisions on other programmes.  The distortion can be removed by adjusting the baseline series so as to include the total net borrowing requirement of the nationalised industries rather than their borrow-ing from the Government (that is, line 3 of table 2 rather thanline 2).  The resulting adjusted baseline total is given in table 3.TABLE 312. The capital programmes and financing requirements of the nationalised industries are the subject of a separate review, whichwill be considered by Ministers. The figures included in thepresent report reflect the outcome of recent discussions which tookplace between departments and the industries in preparation forSECRET
that review. As table 1 shows, the estimate of the nationalised industries&apos; call on government lending exceeds the Cmnd. 6721figures in 1978-79, so that the survey baseline also exceeds theCmnd. 6721 total in that year. The main reason for this is that the survey figures include new provision for shipbuilding and aerospace.The figures are however subject to the decisions which Ministers will ultimately take on the review.Comparison of baseline with 2 per cent growth scenario after1978-7913. The plans published in Cmnd. 6721 reflected the understand-ings reached with the International Monetary Fund about the planned level of public expenditure in 1977-78 and 1978-79. Forthe later years, it was suggested in the Cabinet discussions inFebruary / March that, apart from the special problem of lendingto refinance maturing nationalised industry debt, planning should proceed for the time being on the basis of a growth in public expenditure of 2 per cent a year. Table 4 compares planning figuresconstructed on this basis (line 2) with the adjusted survey baseline(line 1), calculated as in table 3. The difference (line 3) indicatesthe scope for increasing expenditure above baseline levels in the later years of the survey period, while keeping within the 2 percent annual growth path.TABLE 4		  million at 1977		survey prices		1979-80	1980-81	1981-821.

The survey guidelines provided for departments to showproposals for additional expenditure and options for reductions.Within the former category, the programme chapters in Part twoattempt to distinguish between adjustments (in either direction) tomaintain existing planned standards and proposals for new develop-ments. The options for reductions were intended to be sufficientnot only to offset the proposals for additional expenditure but alsoto produce net reductions in programmes of at least 1\ per cent in1978-79 and at least 5 per cent in later years.
15. The Part two programme chapters provide detailed information on all the above items. Annexes 2-5 below bring this materialtogether, programme by programme and department by department.Table 5 shows total proposals for additional expenditure and totaloptions for 2\ per cent/5 per cent reductions.0 It also shows for1978-79 the amount needed to reconstitute the contingency reserveas indicated in paragraph 9.TABLE 5  million at 1977 survey prices.

For 1978-79, the baseline total shown in table 1 is some  49million above the Cmnd. 6721 figure. The higher total is not incon-sistent with the plans set out in the Chancellor&apos;s letter of 15December 1976 to the IMF because it reflects a higher figure forgovernment lending to the nationalised industries, and this wasspecifically excluded from the totals mentioned in the IMF letter.On the other hand, the contingency reserve, which does come within the total used in the IMF letter, is already rather low, andthe case for raising it by  241 million has been mentioned already(paragraph 9 above).  Any increase in the contingency reserve, andlikewise any decisions to accept proposals for additional expenditure,would have to be offset by savings from among the options forreduced expenditure if the plans described in the IMF letter are notto be exceeded.18. For the years after 1978-79, comparison of tables 4 and 5shows that only a proportion of the proposals for additional expen-diture could be met compatibly with a 2 per cent annual growthpath.   If a significant number of these proposals were to beC) This report does not deal with changes to expenditure plans in the current financial year. These are charged, when appropriate, against the contingency reserve, on which the Chief Secretary to the Treasury reports periodically to theCabinet.SECRET
accepted, it would be necessary therefore to look at the options for reductions in annexes 4 and 5. These have been drawn up in thelight of the guidelines; but in some instances the departmentsconcerned have not been able to identify sufficient options to covertheir additional proposals and the 2^-5 per cent level specified in theguidelines.Population and the social services19. As noted earlier, the proposals for additional expendituresummarised in annexes 2 and 3 include some revised estimates ofthe cost of demand-determined services as well as a substantial number of proposals for new developments. Some expenditure programmes are particularly affected by changes in the size of theage groups with which they are concerned. In such cases the relevant demographic projections have been examined in the courseof the discussions between the Treasury and departments, with duerecognition of the uncertainties involved, and the implications for the programmes concerned are suitably noted in the relevant Part twochapter. Account has been taken in this connection of materialpublished in the recent study by the Central Policy Review Staff onpopulation and the social services.Public service manpower20. Annex 8 gives estimates of the levels of public service man-power implied by the survey baseline programmes.21. As regards the civil service, the level of expenditure on the programmes set out in this report implies a civil service strengthremaining just below 750,000 until 1 April 1978 and falling there-after to between 735,000 and 740,000 by the end of the survey period. Acceptance of all additional bids would add a further3,000 in the later years; acceptance of all the Z  per cent and 5 percent options with consequences for civil service staffing levels would reduce numbers by 9,000 to 10,000 in the later years of the survey.22. These numbers take account of the  95 million saving inplanned civil service expenditure (at 1975 prices) agreed by Ministers,and announced, last year. Firm pruning of the figures, includingwhere applicable further substantial &quot; good housekeeping &quot; savings in the years after 1978-79, has made it possible to offset to a largeextent revised assumptions affecting demand-related services. Asa result, there is a good chance that the totals will be no higherthan was publicly forecast in mid-1976.
SECRET----.__Main Report23. The baseline projections for national health service manpowerindicate some increase in 1978 and 1979 followed by a broadlyconstant level thereafter. This matches the overall expenditureprojections. The local authority manpower projections fall in 1977,rise somewhat to 1979 and then fall progressively thereafter. Thefigures for the armed forces do not correspond exactly to the base-line expenditure totals but suggest falls in 1978 and 1979 and a constant level thereafter.24. The overall picture is of a modest decline in public service manpower between 1979 and 1982, offsetting the modest increase between 1976 and 1979. The slight decrease in the manpowerfigures may appear to contrast with the slight increase over the survey period in total wages and salaries at constant prices. Thereare some differences of coverage which hamper comparisons butthe picture is consistent with the past tendency for average realpay to rise, reflecting changes in the mix of skills employed.Debt interest25. In addition to the programme figures examined above and the contingency reserve, the White Papers include estimates of debt interest. This requires no decisions. It is not directly controllable,and forecasts of it are unreliable. As now defined, however, the debt interest total measures amounts which need to be met from taxation or government borrowing, and the figures are thereforerelevant as background to public spending decisions, as well as being included in the White Paper definition of public expenditure.Table 6 gives the latest available projections and compares thesewith the estimates in Cmnd. 6721.TABLE 6_  million at 1977 survey prices1976-77  1977-78   1978-79   1979-80   1980-81   1981-821.

In the new White Paper presentation of public expenditure,no provision is made for shortfall. It is not feasible to programmeshortfall into planning or control totals. Account is taken of possibleshortfall and longfall, however, in preparing forecasts of the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) and the economy.SECRET
27. Provisional estimates suggest that shortfall was unusually heavylast year. Spending was generally well within cash limits, and pricesrose faster than had been assumed when the cash limits were set.Last year&apos;s experience may have reflected the process of adjustment to a new control system, and it should not therefore be assumed tobe typical. In addition, net government lending to the nationalised industries was also substantially below Cmnd. 6721 levels. Thiswas largely due to higher than expected overseas borrowing.New treatment of public corporations other than nationalisedindustries28. Ministers have recently agreed, subject to consultation withthe Expenditure Committee, to extend the new public expenditureclassification of nationalised industries agreed last year to certain other public corporations. The proposal is that government grants and lending to these corporations, rather than their total investment programmes, should in future be scored as public expenditure, thoughthe functional programme chapters will continue to comment, as necessary, on their planned investment programmes.29. If the Expenditure Committee agrees, the new treatment willbe used in the next public expenditure White Paper. Pending con-sultation with them, however, the old treatment is retained in thepresent report. The change of treatment would reduce the baselinetotals by a little since some of the capital expenditure of thesecorporations is financed from internal resources or borrowing from sources other than the Government. The difference is small some 70 million next year rising to some  100 million at the end of the survey period and since it would reduce the illustrative planningtotals by similar amounts the scope for additional expenditure within any given planning total will not be significantly affected.Other aspects30. To help Ministers reach their decisions, this report contains a number of annexes and supplementary analyses in addition tothose mentioned already.31. Annex 6 breaks down the baseline figures by economic category.Expenditure on goods and services is distinguished from expenditureon transfers, and for the former category a breakdown betweencurrent and capital expenditure is provided.32. Annex 7 converts the baseline programmes into &quot; cost terms &quot;.Because of the tendency for public sector prices to rise faster thanthe generality of prices, the ratio of public expenditure to gross
SECRET Main Reportdomestic product (GDP), both measured at current prices, tends torise over time independently of volume changes. The annexattempts to quantify this effect.33. The degree of Government control over public spending variesfrom programme to programme. Expenditure on demand-determined programmes cannot be controlled as closely as other programmes, and expenditure by local authorities raises special problems. Supplementary analysis A in Part two discusses the implications of the survey for expenditure by local authorities.Detailed breakdowns of local authority expenditure and additionalbids are provided.34. Supplementary analyses B and C bring together expenditure for which the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales areresponsible.35. Supplementary analyses D, E and F bring together expenditureincluded within the survey on employment and training measures,inner cities and construction respectively. These matters werementioned in the recent Cabinet discussions as being of especialinterest.36.   Finally,  supplementary  analysis  G  describes  changes  to expenditure programmes since Cmnd. 6721.Summary and conclusion37. This report is intended as the point of departure for Ministerialdiscussions on the 1977 public expenditure survey. The purposeof those discussions is:(i) to take firm decisions on expenditure allocations for1978-79 as the basis for the control of expenditure inthat year (including the fixing of cash limits, estimates and the rate support grant);(ii) to reach provisional decisions on the level and composition of expenditure in 1979-80;(iii) to take a preliminary view on the development of public expenditure plans in the two subsequent years.38. The position in 1978-79 differs in some respects from that inthe subsequent years. For 1978-79, complete plans were published in Cmnd. 6721, which embodied the expenditure decisions under-lying our application to the International Monetary Fund. the contingency reserve provided for that year in Cmnd. 6721 hasalready been reduced to a level well below the scale adoptedSECRET 11
for the corresponding year in past surveys; and a large number ofadditional requirements and proposals for new developments havebeen put forward. Any decisions to approve additions, or toreconstitute the contingency reserve, will need to be offset by savingsif the plans to which the Government is publicly committed arenot to be exceeded in total. Ministers will therefore need to decide which of the additions for 1978-79 listed in annex 2 should beaccepted; how far these should be offset within the programmesconcerned; how much the contingency reserve should be recon-stituted; and which of the options for reductions in annex 4 shouldbe adopted.39. The level of expenditure in 1979-80 and later years was not covered in the application to the IMF. The Cabinet gave provisional approval in the spring to a planning assumption that the total ofexpenditure programmes and the contingency reserve (excluding therefinance of maturing nationalised industry debt) should grow at 2 percent a year, although the possibility of a decision on a higher growth rate from 1979-80 was not ruled out. The additional requirements and new proposals in those years greatly exceed the headroomwhich this planning assumption provides. If such additions wereto be approved on any significant scale, the maintenance of the 2 percent growth path would require offsetting savings to be found.Here again, therefore, Ministers will need to decide which of the additions should be accepted; the size of the contingency reserve;and which of the options should be adopted.

ANNEX 7Public expenditure in cost terms and the relative price effectGeneral1. The main figures in the survey report express the growth ofexpenditure in volume terms that is at the prices of a base period.In practice however relative prices change and, for reasons set outin paragraphs 4-8 of this annex, it is likely that the growth in volume terms underestimates the growth in the real cost ofexpenditure.2. In the four years from 1972-73 to 1976-77 expenditure increased from 38^ to 44 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) at market prices. Much of this increased share was due to the factthat the volume of expenditure grew by over 10 per cent, andGDP only by a little over 3 per cent. But even without any growth in the volume of expenditure, the share of GDP would still have risen to nearly 40 per cent in 1976-77. This is because the average price of the things which public expenditure buys rose by nearlyd\ per cent more than the average domestic prices generally (as measured by the GDP factor cost deflator).3. Similarly, on current projections, GDP would need to increase by nearly 3 per cent between 1976-77 and 1981-82 merely in orderto offset the effect of future movements in relative prices. Puttingit another way, if the volume of expenditure over that period increasesat a given percentage rate GDP would have to grow about \ percent a year faster than that if expenditure is not to represent a growing proportion of GDP.Detailed analysis4. Most of the figures in this report (&quot; at 1977 survey prices&quot;)represent the &quot; output&quot; of public expenditure as expressed by the quantities of goods and services valued at the survey base date.0Taking current prices to represent the relative costs of differentitems of expenditure, it is clear that the volume measurement ofpublic expenditure, at unchanging prices, does not adequatelyrepresent the increase in the real cost of expenditure over this period.A separate series of figures is therefore prepared &quot; at constant prices in cost terms, including the relative price effect&quot;. These take account of price movements relative to the GDP deflator and thusbear the same relation to GDP at constant prices as does public expenditure at current prices to GDP at current prices.   TheO Because the bulk of the public sector&apos;s output is not marketed it cannot bevalued in terms of market prices. Instead its value is equated with the cost ofthe associated inputs at the survey base date. This means that any growth in output due to a more efficient use of the inputs is not revealed.
expenditure is at constant prices in that the effect of general inflationhas been removed, but it reflects how input costs have moved inthe past, and may move in the future. The difference betweenexpenditure in these terms and expenditure at survey prices is called the relative price effect.5. The movements in the relative prices of various economiccategories of expenditure are shown in chart A, and the effects ofthese movements on some expenditure programmes in chart B.There is a general tendency for pay and procurement costs to risefaster than prices in general. Public sector pay increased sharply in1974-75, following the relaxation of the statutory incomes policy,but two further rounds of pay restraint have led to a relative fall.In 1973-74 procurement costs began to be affected by the worldincrease in commodity costs; in 1974-75 they were further affectedby the increase in oil prices, and more recently by the decline in sterling. (The GDP deflator only reflects home costs and is not affected directly by import prices.) The defence, education and health programmes in particular reflect these movements in pay andprocurement costs.6. A general trend is not so apparent in the case of land prices:the outstanding feature here is the explosion between 1972-73 and1973-74, and the subsequent collapse which gave rise to a largenegative relative price effect (RPE) in 1975-76. Construction con-tract prices also rose sharply in 1972-73, but there was a delaybefore this fed through into construction costs. After a peak in1974-75 prices declined in relative terms, as contractors cut theirprofit margins in view of the depressed market. These price move-ments are clearly reflected in the relative prices experienced by theenvironmental programmes.7. It is a hazardous business to predict relative price movements.For the first two years of the survey, recent short-term economicforecasts provide a guide; thereafter only limited and formalisedassumptions have been made. It is assumed that there will be afurther round of pay restraint. For later years, the projections take into account the general tendency for pay to rise faster than theGDP deflator; the same is also true of procurement costs. for construction it is assumed that the present very depressed profit margins will be restored to normal by about 1979.8. The effect of these projections upon public expenditure as a proportion of GDP was given above. They imply that while in volume terms the expenditure shown in the survey base line growsby 7 per cent between 1976-77 and 1981-82, in costs terms it islikely to grow by 10 per cent.

SECRET -_ Main Report: Annex 8Public service manpower1.  Table 1 gives projections of manpower for the main sectors ofemployment in the public services corresponding to the baselinelevels of expenditure programmes. 0 Because of difficulty in obtain-ing appropriate data the figures in this table are not on a fullyconsistent basis. For the same reason most of the public employees in Northern Ireland and staff in research councils and a numberof other smaller central government financed bodies in GreatBritain are excluded.   The totals in the table should therefore not be interpreted as estimates of total employment in the public services or of the total number whose wages and salaries are includedin the definition of public expenditure.  They should only be takento indicate the broad trend of employment by the public servicesimplied by the baseline level of expenditure.  Details of the figuresfor each sector are given in tables 2 to 5.2.   The broad picture which emerges is of a modest decline in publicservice employment after 1979.Civil service3. The figures in table 2 were prepared by the Civil Service Depart-ment and represent the agreed numbers of staff underlying thebaseline provision. The figures are in whole-time equivalent terms.National Health service. The figures in table 3 were prepared by the Department ofHealth and Social Security and by the Welsh Office and the scottish home and Health Department. In line with the conventions usedin Health and Personal Social Services Statistics 1976 the figuresfor hospitals, community health services and other health services are in whole-time equivalent terms, whereas the figures for the familypractitioners service are the numbers of general medical practitionersand dentists.5. The figures are projections from the estimates of the remunera-tion content of the survey provisions and they should be treated asbroad estimates only. For hospitals and community health services in England, the growth in whole time equivalents over the period is expected to be less than the growth in wages and salaries, reflecting,for example, a relatively higher increase in the number of medicalstaff.O The armed forces figures are drawn up on a rather different basis seeparagraph 7 below.SECRET
6. The figures for England and Wales exclude civil servants whosepay is allocated to the health programme including those working at, for example, special hospitals. The figures for other health services in Scotland include the common services agency, providing the blood transfusion services, etc, and also staff at the StateHospital.Armed forces7. Table 4 gives figures for personnel in each branch of the Services.The figures for 1977 onwards come from the 1977 long-termcosting forecast of tri-services manpower (February 1977) andare consistent with a level of expenditure above the baseline. those for 1976 are actual numbers in post at 1 April 1976. Figures forlocally engaged personnel represent men recruited outside theUnited Kingdom for full-time service including, for example,Gurkhas. The &quot; paid reserves &quot; comprise the part-time membersof the Paid Reserve Forces and the Ulster Defence Regiment.8. Figures for the civilian defence staff, excluding locally engagedstaff, are included in the table of civil service manpower.Local authorities9. The manpower figures in table 5 are in whole-time equivalentterms and take account of part-time employees who make up about one-third of total local authority employment in Great Britain ofabout three million. The figures shown include employees in localauthorities&apos; revenue-producing undertakings, e.g. housing and passenger transport, as well as those in rate fund services. Theestimates for individual services are based on departmental returns,except for some small programmes where estimates were made bythe Treasury.10. The figures relate to the baseline figures in the survey report,and therefore do not take any account of additional bids for expendi-ture or reductions which might be achieved by the adoption of lowerexpenditure options.11. Local authority staffing in England and Wales has beenmonitored since the middle of 1975 by the Government and localauthority associations through the joint manpower watch groupreporting to the Consultative Council on Local Government Finance.A similar watch on staff numbers in Scotland was instituted in con-sultation with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. with only a few exceptions these manpower watch figures have been used as the base for the projections in the table.
Main Report: Annex 812.   For England and Wales the joint manpower watch returngave whole-time equivalent totals of 2,059,000 in March 1975 and2,093,000 in March 1976.   This compares with the figures in the table of 2,065,000 for 1 April 1975 and 2,105,000 for 1 April 1976,but these figures include about 14,000 part-time firemen who are excluded from the joint manpower watch.   The latest joint man-power watch return available, that for December 1976, showed aslight decrease from the March 1976 return to a figure of 2,091,000.This compares with the decrease shown in the table to a figure of2,101,000 for 1 April 1977.13. In aligning the 1975 and 1976 figures more closely with thoseof the manpower watch, the figures for several of the major pro-grammes have been substantially revised from the table on localauthority manpower in the 1976 survey report.table.at,0nal Health Servicef^Kd forces .Loca&apos; authorities     \Total of a houpPublic services manpower projections-summaryThousands						1976	1977	1978	1979	1980	1981	1982748 953 337 2,361	746 971 330 2,353	746 980 324 2,359	742 991 319 2,365	739 992 317 2,359	738 993 317 2,354	738 993 317 2,344

SECRETMain Report: Annex 9ANNEX 9Basis for preparation of 1977 survey reportIntroduction1. The purpose of the 1977 survey is to enable Ministers to decide the level of public expenditure programmes as a basis for control in 1978-79; and to review the programmes for later years, and extendthem into 1981-82, for provisional planning purposes.The starting point2. The 1977 survey takes as its starting point the levels of expendi-ture programmes which emerged from the 1976 survey, as amended by the decisions announced on 15 December 1976 and any sub-sequent collective decisions on the use of the contingency reserve.Special treatment will however need to be accorded to the transi-tional year 1979-80.3. For the years 1977-78, 1978-79 and 1980-81, the figures to beincluded in the survey tables are those which emerged from the 1976survey and the December decisions, adjusted for:(i) revaluation to 1977 survey prices;(ii) any changes approved by Ministers as a charge on theCmnd. 6721 contingency reserve up to 31 May 1977, andany offsetting savings agreed in connection with such changes;(iii) for 1977-78, any reduction in the volume of expenditureagreed during the examination of Estimates;(iv) any reductions after 1978-79 which flow from policy changes announced in the December statement, or otherdirect consequences of the measures taken to effect the december cuts;(v) any approved classification changes.4. For 1979-80, the figures to be included in the survey reporttables, for those services not reduced by the December cuts, shouldbe calculated as in paragraph 3 above. For those services whichwere reduced by the December cuts, the Treasury and departments should seek to agree figures providing a suitable path between1978-79 and 1980-81. Failing such agreement, a figure midwaybetween those for 1978-79 and 1980-81 should be inserted in theprogramme tables as a benchmark from which subsequent changescan be measured, but the options (see paragraphs 10-11 below)should indicate possible alternative paths.
5. For 1981-82, the survey figures should be equal to those for1980-81, except where it is agreed between the Treasury and thedepartment concerned that some lesser figure is appropriate. Anyrequirements going beyond the 1980-81 level should be identifiedfor Cabinet decision.The survey report6. The survey report should set out for each spending programme the information shown in the annex. 0 The main components of this information are:(a) the survey figures;(b) any additional (or reduced) requirements for the main-tenance of existing planned standards;(c) any proposals for new developments;id) options for reductions.Only in exceptional circumstances should proposals for additional expenditure be included under (b) or (c) before 1979-80.7. The report on each programme should describe the implications-tions of keeping expenditure on the services concerned within the survey figures. Each of the items under (b), (c) and (d) should alsobe briefly described. This description should include an indication of the spending authority concerned (i.e. central governmentdepartment, local authorities, or public corporation). Any con-sequences for civil service or local authority manpower should be clearly stated.8. In the case of items under (b), the description should identify the nature of the additional (or reduced) requirements, i.e. whetherthey reflect revised demographic or demand estimates or changesin the underlying economic assumptions. It should also indicatewhether the level of the expenditure concerned is governed by existing legislation or regulations or is within the Governmentsadministrative control.9. If any additional requirements are included under (b) and (c),the report should describe how, if necessary, offsetting savings couldbe found within the departments programmes as a whole.10. In the options under (d), the aim should be to illustrate themaximum feasible reductions in 1978-79 and later years, amountingto at least 2\ per cent in 1978-79 and 5 per cent in later years, overand above those required in paragraph 9. The responsible depart-ment and spending authority should be identified in each case.For 1979-80, if the path has not been settled by agreement,O See enclosure to PESC (77) 9.
the options should also illustrate possible alternative paths for ministerial decision.11. Options for reductions should not be included if they wouldrequire new main legislation. The report should indicate whethersubordinate legislation is required or not. The inclusion ofparticular options in the survey report does not carry any impli-cation that Ministers will necessarily adopt them, but is intendedto enable them to examine choices and priorities if they wish to finance unavoidable increases elsewhere, or (in 1978-79) if it isnecessary to provide an expenditure component to the &quot; fiscaladjustment &quot; mentioned in the December statement.12. In those instances where additional requirements or optionsfor reductions do not exceed  1 million in any one year, they neednot be displayed separately in the survey report but will be for separate discussion between the Treasury (and CSD where appro-priate) and the departments concerned.13. The nationalised industries will be the subject of a specialexercise. There will be a separate interdepartmental report to ministers on the investment programmes and financing of each industry, including appropriate options in respect of individual industries. The financing figures for the nationalised industries asa whole will be summarised in the survey report, and if the pro-posals for total net government lending are higher than the surveyfigures in programme 5, the reasons for this will be summarisedand options for offsetting reductions will be set out.14. The presentation of public corporations (other than the nationalised industries) is at present being reviewed, and the surveyreport should reflect the decisions which will be taken on that review.In the meantime, figures should be established both for investment by these corporations and for the government finance provided to them, so that any presentational changes can be made smoothlyas soon as the decisions have been taken.
