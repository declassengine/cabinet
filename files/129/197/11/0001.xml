CABINET

DEVOLUTION

Note by the Lord President of the Council

1. We need to respond, before the Recess, to the detailed representations

of the Liberals and announce our intentions for legislation on devolution next

Session.

2. In a long process of consultations, the Liberals have been persuaded

not to insist on a number of their most important proposals which would

either not be acceptable to us or which could diminish support for legislation

in the House of Commons.    In particular they no longer insist on revenue

raising powers for the Assemblies and accept that their essentially

federalistic approach for Scotland and Wales would not secure support in

Parliament.    On proportional representation, we reached agreement in

March that there would be a free vote in any further debate.    This remains

the position.

3. A sufficient measure of agreement is in prospect on the basis of a

number of other changes to the provisions of the Scotland and Wales Bill

and these have all been agreed by the Ministerial Committee on Devolution

Strategy.    The more important are broadly described in the draft

Statement attached to this note (Annex A).

4. The draft Statement includes the commitment to introduce separate

Bills for Scotland and Wales.    I have reluctantly concluded that separate

Bills are essential, despite the representations of the Labour Party in

Wales.    This decision would provide an important component for agreement

with the .Liberals, has been urged on us by the Scottish Council of the Labour

Party and in the previous debates in the House and should provide a better

prospect of progress being made on devolution.    The Ministerial

Committee on Devolution Strategy has agreed this course.    It would be

essential, at every stage, to make clear beyond doubt that we are fully and

equally committed to the passage of both Bills.


5. Also attached (Annex B) is the draft of a Whice Paper on financing

the devolved services which I propose to publish on the day of my Statement.

This will be of great importance in explaining why no revenue raising powers

have yet been found practical and the further measures we have in mind to

ease the working of the block fund arrangements.    This will allow a much

better informed debate on these important and contentious matters and

should help win support for our conclusions.    Part I of the draft is

summarised in paragraphs 61 to 65;  and Part II in paragraphs 91 +o 93.

6. I 3eek the Cabinet&apos;s agreement to:-

i. the Statement I propose, including the announcement of

the decision to introduce separate Bills for Scotland and Wales;

ii. publication of the White Paper on the same day.

DRAFT STATEMENT

With permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to make a Statement on devolution.

In the light of the debates in the House and other representations, the

Government have concluded that changes can he made to improve the schemes

we proposed for devolution.     I wish to inform the House of the main changes

we now propose.

The Government will introduce two Bills next session to provide, respectively,

for devolution to Scotland and to Wales.     The Government have always heen

fully and equally committed to the achievement of devolution for both countries

and we will present the two Bills to the House on that understanding and on

the same basis.     We believe that the House would welcome the separate

consideration of what are dissimilar proposals.

For any question relating to the interpretation or application of the devolution

statutes, we will now propose that the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council

should be the final court of reference, as well as undertaking the pre-Assent

scrutiny of Scottish Assembly Bills.     The Judicial Committee will thereby

finally be the sole court determining questions on vires.

We believe that it is possible to dispense with certain of the detailed controls

on the actions of the devolved administra.tions to provide more clear cut

arrangements.     We will propose that the Government&apos;s general reserve powers

should be available only in cases where a matter is prejudiced for which there

is no devolved responsibility.     The powers will remain as an essential safe-

guard to protect matters which are not to be devolved, for example defence,

trade, the economy and industrial relations.


We will drop the proposed statutory powers to limit rents and prescribe model

rent and rebate schemes.     We will also drop the need for the Secretary of

State&apos;s consent for changes in the pay and pensions of Scottish teachers and

for the pensions arrangements of a number of public bodies in both Scotland

and Wales.

We will also propose the reservation of responsibility for the pay and pensions

of teachers and for the health service in Wales.

Given the expressed concerns about the structure of local government in Wales,

we will propose that the Welsh Assembly should have a statutory duty to review

the structure of local government.

As for the Assemblies themselves, we have concluded that it is unnecessary to

regulate so precisely the way they axe to conduct their business.     We will

also propose a power of premature dissolution for the Scottish Assembly

dependent, on a vote of at least two-thirds of its members.     We no longer

propose the creation of Assembly Commissioners for the investigation of

complaints against the new administrations and their officials and will

propose that the Scottish Assembly should be able to legislate on this matter.

The Government are continuing to develop these and other proposals for inclusion

in new legislation for introduction next session.     The House will, of course,

wish to consider them fully when they are expressed in legislative form and

can provide the basis for debate.

In our review we have paid particular attention to the arrangements for financing

the devolved services,     A White Paper is being published this afternoon setting

out our conclusions and the background on them.     The House will wish to know

________ /Annex 1


that we have not identified any satisfactory form of independent revenue

raising power for the devolved administrations.     But the White Paper makes

clear that we are ready to discuss with the devolved administrations if they

wish whether it is possible to find an acceptable supplementary tax power.

The White Paper also sets out measures which we have in mind to improve the

working of the block fund arrangements.     First, we intend to propose to the

devolved administrations the possibility of setting up an independent advisory

board with the task of improving the information base for financial discussions.

And secondly, we shall explore with them the scope for settling devolved

expenditure for a period of, say, four years ahead as a fixed percentage of

comparable expenditure elsewhere in the country.

Additionally, on the establishment of the new administrations, it is the

Government&apos;s intention to seek their agreement to the establishment of Joint

Councils for Scotland and for Wales, on which representatives of the Government

and the new administrations could consult as necessary on matters of common

concern.     These would provide a valuable means of ensuring continuing

co-operation and consultation.

The Government believe that the changes&apos; now proposed will result in simpler

and more clear cut arrangements for devolution and firmly secure the interests

of the people of the United Kingdom as a whole.


DEVOLUTION : FINANCING THE DEVOLVED SERVICES

INTRODUCTION

1. This White Paper sets out the background to the Government&apos;s proposals for

financing devolved services in Scotland and Wales, principally by means of

block funds approved by the House of Commons,  and explains how the arrangements

for settling the block funds are expected to work.

2. Part I discusses the Government&apos;s reasons for preferring a system based on

expenditure needs rather than revenue raising capacity.   And it examines the

scope for conferring some limited tax powers on the devolved administrations to

enable them to supplement the block funds.   It explains why none of the possible

devolved tax powers is considered suitable for inclusion in the forthcoming

legislation;    but makes clear that the Government are prepared to discuss with

the devolved administrations, if they so wish^whether it is possible to find

acceptable supplementary tax powers.

3. Part II explains the need for consultations about the spending plans of

the devolved administrations and the Government as part of the continuing

process of planning public expenditure;    and the need subsequently to divide

devolved expenditure between the components to be paid for from the block fund,

from local authority rates and from borrowing for capital expenditure by local

authorities and public corporations.   It also provides information about the

scale of the finance which the devolved administrations are likely to require.

4. It would not be right for the Government to settle unilaterally the

procedures to be followed in their dealings with the devolved administrations

on these matters;    the views of the devolved administrations will themselves

be one of the main determinants.   Part II, however, describes arrangements

which the Government intend to propose with a view to facilitating the operation

of the system.   These include basing expenditure allocations on a relationship,

to be fixed for a number of years at a time, between expenditure on the devolved

services and corresponding expenditure in the country as a whole;    and the

appointment of an independent advisory body to assist the Government and the

devolved administrations with statistics and other information relating to

comparative needs and standards in the public services concerned.


PART I.    THE BASIS FOR FINANCE

The policy &quot;background

(1)

5. The Kilbrandon Commission on the Constitution v &apos;identified two main methods

of financing devolved services -

a. the revenue basis under which a devolved administration would be given

certain sources of revenue and would be obliged to finance the devolved

services out of the income those sources produced; and

b. the expenditure basis under which the expenditure requirements of the

devolved services would be measured and the devolved administration would

then be furnished with the income needed to meet them.

6. In the Government&apos;s view this distinction is fundamental, it is possible

to devise various systems in which features of both a revenue basis and an

expenditure basis are present.    But each such system belongs primarily to one or

other of the two main categories.   It will be revenue based if taxation decisions

by the devolved administration are the main determinant of the total of devolved

expenditure, even though part of that expenditure is met by government grant.

It will be expenditure based if the main determinant is a central contribution

from United Kingdom resources, even though the devolved administration may have

limited powers to augment that contribution from revenues of their own.

7. The Kilbrandon Commission pointed out that the system of finance prescribed

for Northern Ireland in 1920 was the revenue basis but that the system which came

to be used in practice - because revenues in Northern Ireland did not prove

sufficient to sustain parity of services with the rest of the United Kingdom at

common rates of tax - was the expenditure basis.


8.     The allocation of public expenditure between different geographical areas

of Great Britain has traditionally not been determined by the amount of revenue

raised in them but by their relative needs.   This has long been the basis on

which the Government has managed such expenditure programmes as industrial and

regional assistance.    The same principle governs the distribution of rate support

grant between local authorities to enable them, despite wide differences in

local resources, to provide comparable levels of service.

(2)

9-     The Government, in their White Paper of September 1974     , proposed an

expenditure based system of devolution in Scotland and Wales.   This was to take

the form of a block fund voted by Parliament under arrangements which would

take account both of local needs and of the desirability of some uniformity of

standards of service and of contributions in all parts of the United Kingdom.

10.   The further White Paper of November 1975^ which set out the Government&apos;s

letailed proposals for devolution in Scotland and Wales endorsed the case for an

expenditure based system.   It explained that economic unity required a system which

considered the expenditure needs of the whole United Kingdom, including the claims

of regions with special problems: and that such a system required the continued

pooling of all the resources of the United Kingdom, wherever and however they

arose - in particular, there could be no question of devolving any entitlement to

revenues from off-shore oil.

11    The Government&apos;s proposals have been criticised on two main grounds* First, it is

claimed that discussions between the Government and the devolved administrations about

the appropriate level of public expenditure on devolved services will become annual

occasions for dispute. Secondly, it is seen as a disadvantage that the

devolved administrations will not be responsible for raising the revenue to finance

their expenditure.

 2.   Even if these criticisms were justified, they could not be met by conferring

revenue-raising powers within a system based on the assessment of expenditure needs.

If public expenditure on devolved services is to bo determined by needs and not by

the amount of revenue raised in Scotland or Wales, then the revenue raised from

devolved taxes would still have to be topped up by a block fund voted at Westminster

l* it proved inadequate to meet these needs J and if on the other hand, the revenue

raised from devolved taxes proved excessive, +he excess would have to be surrendered

the centra,! poo! of resources.   In each case the overall level of expenditure

 n devolved services would still have to be discussed and assessed against need3.

(2) Democracy and revolution: Proposals for Scotland ovd Wales (Cmrid 5732)

\i) Cur Changing Democracy* Devolution to Scotland and Wales (C.und 6348)


13.   The criticisms in paragraph 11&apos;could be fully met only by relating devolved

expenditure to the amount of revenue raised in Scotland or Wales. However,

such a system would suffer from serious disadvantages.   It would be incompatible with

the distribution of resources to the different parts of the United Kingdom according

to their needs, as the great majority of people consider desirable.   Substantial new

Scottish or Welsh taxes (or significantly different levels of national taxes) would also

have a distorting effect on the location and operation of industry and commerce and on

the private affairs of many individuals.   And a system which involved a legal division

of tax powers between the Government and the devolved administrations would import into

the distribution of resources a lack of adaptability which an expenditure-based system

avoids 

14    A revenue-based system would tend to lead to wide variations between standards

of public services in different parts of the country.   The poorer areas would come

off worst.   It is doubtful if this would be generally acceptable.   Moreover,, it is

not practicable, in the Government&apos;s view, to identify in advance a group of taxes

whose proceeds, at acceptable rates, would be likely, even for a short time ahead,

to match changing expenditure requirements.   This is demonstrated by the progressive

move away from the original revenue based system in Northern Ireland and by the

various methods adopted in many federal systems (which make a formal division in

tax powers) to transfer financial resources to states or provinces whose local


resources are inadequate to meet their needs (often in the form of support to

specific &quot;devolved&quot; programmes which the national government wishes to encourage).

The maintenance of political stability in the United Kingdom would not be

assisted by a legal division of tax powers which had regularly to be adjusted in

order to avoid unequal distribution of burdens or excessive disparity in the

standards of public services.

15*   Separate systems of taxation in Scotland and Hales, involving different taxes

from England (or different levels or other conditions of payment for the same

taxes), would result in greater collection costs falling on the public sector

and larger numbers of collection staff.   Many businesses would also face higher

administrative costs.   The additional costs falling on the public sector could

be recovered from Scottish and Welsh taxpayers but where the taxpayer was in

business the costs would be liable to be passed on to customers generally.

16.   In an expenditure based system, by contrast, it is possible, through continuing

consultation on the needs of the devolved services as these vary from time to time,

to ensure a fair distribution of resources as between these and other public

services at any given time.   The arrangements which the Government have proposed

produce a clear division between the block funds and the financing of non-devolved

services.   They avoid provision, for example, for central grants, such as are

found in many federal systems, tied to particular devolved services, since they

could be used to interfere in spending decisions of the devolved administrations*

17    The Government&apos;s view therefore remains that an expenditure-based system is

clearly preferable to a revenue-based one.   However, as the White Paper of

November 1975 made clear, allocating resources according to needs does not mean

that the expenditure basis must be applied rigidly: it would not be incompatible

to give the devolved administrations powers to levy limited additional taxation

in order to finance extra expenditure which they might think especially important.

The White Paper proposed a power to levy a Scottish or Welsh surcharge on local

rates for this purpose but this was later witbdwn    ill the light of comments

received.


Assignment

18.  A suggestion made for reducing the dependence of the devolved administration

on block funds voted by the House of Commons is that a share in United Kingdom

revenues should be assigned to them, as of right.   The essential difference between

such assignment of revenues and the devolution of a tax power is that assignment

would give no discretion to vary the level or other conditions of payment of the

taxj    but resources would be transferred without any vote procedure in the

House    of Commons.

19    Assignment could relate to the amount raised in Scotland or Wales from a

specified tax or taxes; or to a percentage of the total yield of all national

taxes; or to a percentage of a given element in total public expenditure; or simply

to a specified sum.   Under an expenditure based system, however, resources are

allocated in accordance with assessed needs.   So long as it is intended to relate

funds to assessed needs it would be necessary to enable the resources assigned

to the devolved administrations to be topped up - as under the Northern Ireland

Constitution Act 1973 - to match the predetermined total of expenditure arrived

at on the basis of needs.   And if the arrangements made it possible for revenues

to be assigned in excess of relative needs there would have to be scope for

adjustment in the other direction.   An expenditure based system is designed to be

fair not only to the areas with devolved administrations but to the rest of the

country as well.   It would not be justifiable to treat the assessment of needs

as a floor below which the revenues of the Scottish and Welsh administrations would

not drop but above which the administrations could keep any excess which the

system of assigned taxes might produce.


20..   A primary purpose of assignment would be to give the devolved administrations

a sense of possessing revenues for which a case did not have to be approved by

the House of Commons every year.   This would be effective only if the amounts

assigned represented a very substantial proportion of the expected expenditure

on devolved services: but if assigned taxes covered a very hig proportion of

devolved expenditure there would be a considerable risk that sums would have

to be recovered whenever taxes turned out to be more buoyant than expenditure.

2.1     To determine whether assigned revenue ought to be adjusted in any particular

year a block fund total for the devolved services would have to be calculated,

exactly as under the Government&apos;s original proposals; and the final say on marginal

expenditure by the devolved administrations would continue to rest with the

Government and the House of Commons since they would determine the amount of the

topping up or recovery.

22.   A system of assigning United Kingdom revenues to the devolved administrations

would not make it easier for them to vary the level of public expenditure on the

devolved services nor make them in any way accountable to their electorates for the

raising of the revenues concerned.   At the same time assignment would introduce

new administrative complexities and would create further scope for political

contention.   The Government accordingly do not believe that it would improve the

devolved financial arrangements.-

Supplementary tax powers

23-   As was made clear in the November 1975 White Paper the Government would see

no difficulty in principle, and certain advantages in practice, if the devolved

administrations wore to have powers to raise limited additional revenue to

supplement the block funds.   In contrast to assignment of IJK revenues this would

mean that the devolved administrations would themselves nave the final say on the

amount of additional expenditure at the margin while the Government and the House

of Commons Would continue to settle the block funds as the appropriate contribution

from the pool of national revenues.


&apos;24.   In proceedings on the Scotland and Wales Bill in the 1976-77 Session of

Parliament Ministers emphasized that they were prepared to consider a replacement

for the Scottish or Welsh surcharge on the rates, provided that a tax could he

found which would operate fairly and economically.

25. Speaking in the Second Reading debate on the Bill (Hansard, 14 December 1976,

col. 1275) the Secretary of State for Scotland set out eight criteria against

which any such supplementary tax would have to be judged.   These are:

i.     the tax must be operable as a marginal supplement, capable of being

turned on and off as needed;

ii.     it must be cheap to collect in relation to the revenue to be raised;

iii. it should fall on Scotland or Wales only and not be paid directly or

indirectly by English taxpayers; conversely it should not permit evasion

by a change of business location;

iv. it must be compatible with European Community requirements;

v. it must be broadly based and not restricted to special groups;

vi. it should not significantly affect the management of the United Kingdom

economy;

vii.     it should be seen by those paying it as a tax imposed by the Scottish or

Welsh Assembly and not be lost in the mass of general taxation;

viii     it must be politically possible and not just technically practicable.

26. As the Secretary of State explained, the Government had already examined

existing taxes with these criteria in mind.   The possibilities have since again

been reviewed to reconsider the scope, within the broad framework of the criteria,

either for Scottish or Welsh supplements to existing national taxes or for

entirely new Scottish or Welsh taxes.


27-?   The first two   criteria    axe particularly important.   The block funds

will in any case represent Scotland&apos;s and Wales&apos;s fair sha,re of national resources

for the devolved services.   There is no call for Scottish or Welsh taxpayers

to carry a higher permanent burden of taxation than elsewhere.   What is at issue

is a power for the devolved administrations to levy a limited additional tax from

time to time to meet special additional expenditure for which there may be a

particular demand.

28,..   Ease and cheapness of collection are especially important for a tax to be turned

on and off in this way, possibly at relatively short notice.   The need to establish

and dismantle arrangements involving substantial numbers of staff could in practice

make a devolved power useless.   And the cost of collection would have to ba a

charge on the proceeds of the tax itself and not fall on the whole body of United

Kingdom taxpayers.   It was these factors which led to the original proposal for a

power to surcharge local rates - the only form of taxation in the United Kingdom

related to place of residence - since the exercise of this power would have involved

a minimum of special machinery. 1

_2q.   The following paragraphs surmarise, in relation to particular taxes or groups

of taxes, the factors identified in the Government&apos;s review and the conclusions

which the Government has reached.

Income Tax

30* Income tax is a broadly based direct tax, with the highest yield of any

individual tax.   A small supplement in Scotland or Wales could produce a sizeable

revenue for the devolved administration.   It is clearly a first candidate for

consideration as the basis for a devolved supplementary tax.


31.   Taxes on income are frequently shared, between federal governmenta and provinces

(United States, Canada, Australia,) and between local authorities and central

government (Sweden). Either two separate systems operate side by side (eg USA)

or the two elements are combined in a single organisation (eg Sweden).   But in all

these cases the tax is a permanent feature of the revenue raising capacity of

both levels of government        It is nowhere treated as an optional source of

supplementary revenue.     None of these countries, moreover, has a sophisticated

PAYE system like ours, which is largely self-regulating and which currently accounts

for 50 per cent of total tax revenue, as well as 90 per cent of NI contributions

(in all, about  l8,000m). A supplementary income tax would impose a heavy new

burden on the PAYE system   and would reduce its efficiency as the Government&apos;s

main revenue collector.   Furthermore, because &apos;&quot; m marginal tax would be at a low

rate, the cost of collection could represent as much as 20 per cent of the yield.

32..   These costs are high because the changes needed in order, first,to identify

taxpayers resident in Scotland and WaJ.es, and then to ensure that they pay the

supplements, would affect the whole UK   tax system.   As things now stand, the

Inland Revenue needs only an address at which it can reach a taxpayer; it does

not need to establish in which country within the United Kingdom he resides.

Before a supplementary tax could be operated enquiries about rp&apos;jidence would be

needed, and these could not be limited to tax offices in Scotland and Wales. This

is because for the great majority of taxpayers (those dealt With under PAYE) it is

the location of the employer *s payroll that determines which&apos;.tax office deals

with their affairs, regardless of where the employee lives.

33.   Many large employers with branches all over Great Britain have on their

payroll employees resident in England, Scotland and Wales.   If there were a Scottish

and/or a Welsh supplement to income tax all Inland Revenue tax offices in the UK

would need to find out year by year where taxpayers whose affairs were dealt with

in their district lived.   They would then have to instruct employers to deduct the


supplement as well as the UK tax for all those who were liable to pay it as

residents in Scotland and/or Wales.

34. Because income tax is an annual tax, and the weekly or monthly deductions

from earnings under PAYE are made on a cumulative basis, it would not be possible,

when collecting the supplement, to take account of changes of residence during

the tax year or for some time before it began.   In order to deduct the supplement,

employers would have to be told before the start of the tax year of the residence

status of their employees, and for this to be done residence status would have to

be determined some time earlier, probably on the basis of a statutory declaration

of residence made by individual taxpayers.   Accordingly, the supplement would,

apply not only to current residents in Scotland and Wales (wherever they worked)

but also to any employe  who had moved from Scotland or Wales since the qualifying

date.   An employer in any part of the UK might therefore be required to deduct

the supplement since he might have an employee who had lived in Scotland or Wales

on the date on which residence for the tax year concerned was determined. An

employer based in say Sheffield or Birmingham would need to apply different PAYE

deductions depending on the &quot;residence&quot; of particular employees. Employees

resident in England would come under one deduction scheme, and if both devolved

ad-ministrations had decided to levy supplements at different rates there would be

separate deduction schemes for residents in Scotland and Wales.   Employers based

in Scotland or Wales would similarly need to make special provision for employees

resident outside that country.   About 530,000 of the 2&amp; million taxpayers resident

in Scotland are dealt with by tax offices south of the border; and &lt;a much&apos; larger

number of taxpayers living outside Scotland are dealt with by PAYE C entre 1- at

East Kilbride and other tax offices in Scotland.

35. Tha application of the supplement to the self-employed (who are not within

PAYE) does not present the same problems, since they are in general dealt with by

the office relating to their place of business, and tax liability is assessed after

the end of the year concerned. But there would be difficulties in applying a

supplementary tax to investment income. At present, in most cases, tax on invest-

ment income is paid at source.   This would not be practicable for Scottish and

Welsh supplements and new arrangements would be needed for collection case by case

by direct assessment at the end of the year.


3(5, The Inland Revenue estimate the annual cost to the public sector of a

collection system for Scottish and Welsh taxes on the basis described above

at about  15 million a year, representing 3,500 staff; about half of this

staff would be taken up with the issue and receipt of residence returns, the

determination of liability and the issue of codings and instructions to

employers in relation to PAYE, and additional assessments and appeals in respect

of investment income would account for perhaps a further 15 per cent of the

additional staff.   This cost (which would fall on Scottish and&apos;Welsh taxpayers)

would have to be incurred to enable the tax to be levied at all and the bulk of

it would continue to arise every year even if the tax was not imposed in any

L      -, i   -,   , /  SuDolemcntary

particular year.   If machinery was set up to levy a Scottish/tax only tne cost

might be about a quarter less, representing say 2,500 staff.   The cost to

employers might be roughly as high as to the Revenue.   A.ny one of them might

have an employee living in Scotland or Wales, or liable to Scottish or Welsh

income tax because he had lived there on the relevant date.   As many as three

different tax deduction   schemes could thus be in operation simultaneously.

The extra complications would add considerably to the work which PATE, value

added tax and the national insurance system already require from employers and

increase the possibility of errors, thus hindering the efficient collection of

taxes and contributions of all forms.


37. A. tax applying to persons employed in Scotland or Wales (including the

self employed) rather than persons resident there would require rather fewer

staff to administer it - about 2000 for a tax relating to Scotland alone.

A tax related to place of employment would, however,  seem less equitable

than a tax related to place of residence since it is the residents of Scotland

or Wales who constitute the electorate there and who would be affected by the

policies on housing, health,  education and so on for which the devolved adminis-

trations would be responsible.

38. An alternative approach has been suggested under which there would be a

wholly Scottish or Welsh income tax.    On this basis, personal reliefs .and

allowances, and the tax base generally, would be the same for the United

Kingdom as a whole but the Scottish Assembly would determine the rate of tax

chargeable on the incomes of Scottish residents, and receive all the revenues

from them.   The operational problems of such an arrangement for both the

Inland Revenue and employers, would be similar to those of a supplementary tax,

but the Revenue staff requirement might be slightly smaller, perhaps about 2,200;

this reflects the fact that an integral Scottish tax would be marginally simpler

to administer because there would be no need to split the liability into two

components.

39    It is olear that, although a supplementary income tax seems an attractive

candidate, at first sight because of its high yield and broad coverage, it

would have serious disadvantages as a marginal tax, let alone one whioh could

be turned on or off*    Similar objections would apply to a scheme under whioh

the Assembly fixed the rates and received the whole yield from income tax

applicable to Scottish (or Welsh) residents.   In either case the staff require-

ment would in general be a continuing one, and although the volume of work

might be reduced in any year in which the devolved rate &quot;was the same as in the

rest of the United Kingdom, numbers of trained staff could, not be readily

adjusted at short notice.

l JLuP. Added Tax (VAT) or a general Sales Ta :

 -lO.   Just as income tax is a broadly based direct tax so is VAT a. broadly

baseu indirect tax.   As with income tax a small supplement could produce a

substantial yield, although a.t considerable cost to the private as well as

the public sector.   The conclusive objection to Scottish and Welsh supplements

to VAT is however the fact that they would not be compatible with the .&apos;European

economic Community&apos;s Directives on VAT, which are designed to harmonise

turnover taxation in the Coorounity*


41.,  Even if international obligations did not rule out such supplements there

would be similar objections within the domestic common market of the United

Kingdom, because these supplements could produce serious distortions in trading

patterns.   Moreover, in addition to the international and domestic problems of

distorting competition,  supplements in Scotland and/or Wales would create

problems at all stages in the chain of production and distribution at which

VAT is applied.   At present there is no need to make distinctions between

different parts of the United Kingdom.   At each stage input tax paid on purchase

i3   recovered by the trader when he accounts to the tax authority for the output

tax charged to the customer.   If supplements were levied those engaged in trans-

actions with other parts of the United Kingdom would need to recover input tax

and account for output tax not only for VAT but also for the supplement. This

would pose severe problems for traders accounting now for VAT alone.

4-2* a general sales tax in Scotland and/or Wales would also be incompatible

with the European Economic Community&apos;s Directives on VAT.     Apart from this

overriding objection such a tax might avoid some of the practical problems of

supplements to VAT.   But the introduction of taxation additional to VAT at the

retail stage would impose severe and possible unmanageable difficulties for

retailers.   Such a tax would require a large offi vial control staff   and would

lead to a degree of distortion in consumers&apos; buying habits;   Mail Order and

similar firms based outside Scotland or Wales might be given a competitive

edge over retailers based there.

Sales Taxes on particular commodities

43-- Even if a general sales tax is ruled out, the possibility remains of

providing pc^er to place a tax, or an additional tax, on the sale of particular


commodities which, already bear a United Kingdom excise duty,  such as tobacco,

alcoholic drinks and hydrocarbon oils, the production and initial distribution

of which are already adapted, to varying degrees, to the requirements of the

taxation system.

44-.   In the case of tobacco, a differential tax in Scotland or Hales on

cigarettes is ruled out by the EEC First Directive on Tobacco which provides

that throughout each Member State both the proportional excise duty and the

specific excise duty must be at the same rate for all cigarettes.

45* Differentia], taxes on hydrocarbon oils and alcoholic drinks would

create severe practical problems.   Given the high proportion of duty in

relation to the cost of these goods the rewards of evasion are considerable.

The present systems of revenue control reduce the risk of evasion by charging

the duties at an early stage, either at importation or when the goods concerned

leave bonded premises for distribution on the home market.   The points at which

the duties are collected bear no necessary relationship to the point of final

consumption.   Special arrangements would therefore have to be made to identify

and isolate supplies destined for Scotland or Wales. Alternatively the duties

would have to be applied at the point of entry into or at retail sale in that

country.   The complexity of. these arrangementswould rule out the adoption of

supplementa.ry taxes on these goods, or of new taxes on other commodities,

as marginal sources of additional income suitable for turning on or off

from year to year.

A tax on the occiination of property

46. Taxation related to the occupation of property is, in the form of local rates,

a major source of finance for local government expenditure, and second only to

income tax as a source of public revenue.   The Government originally proposed

that the devolved adminisira/tion* should have power to surcharge on the rates

hut this did not find public favour.

47. Different forms of devolved property tax would no doubt be feasible and if

applied within the general framework of local taxation in Scotland and Wales, which

defines local residence without introducing costly new procedux&apos;cs, they could be

economical to operate.   There could, however, be difficulty in achieving full

accountability if the local taxpayer was not able to distinguish between the

components in his tax payment imposed by the local authority and by the devolved

administration.

15


Taxes on Companies

48.   The main forms of company taxation are      corporation tax (which also falls

on the capital gains of companies)   and the surcharge recently imposed on employers*

national insurance contributions.

49    A supplementary corporation tax would give rise to a number of serious problems.

It would not fall specifically onthe Scottish or Welsh taxpayer and it would be

difficult to police effectively where a company operated not only in Scotland or

Wales but also in other parts of the United Kingdom.

50.   Differentially high taxation for companies in Scotland or Wales   including

surcharges on employers&apos; national insurance contributions   would operate in direct

opposition to regional policies designed to encourage investment and create jobs and

could frustrate sectoral industrial policies.   Such policies will remain the respon-

sibility of the United Kingdom Government and it would be wrong to devolve taxation

powers which,  if operated, must inevitably lead to conflicts of purpose.

Taxes related to off-shore oil

31.   Companies engaged in off-shore oil operations are liable to corporation   tax and

also to petroleum revenue tax, a specialised form of corporation tax payable on profits

from United Kingdom oil.   Royalties   which are not a tax but are payable in return

for the extraction rights conferred in licences issued by the Government   also form

part of United Kingdom revenues from offshore oil.

52.   The Government have repeatedly made clear that all these revenues will continue

to accrue to the United Kingdom as a whole.   They form part of the national pool of

revenues from which resources provided for the devolved administrations will be

drawn.   To the extent that Scotland and Wales receive above-average shares of public

expenditure generally they will derive particular benefit from these - as from other-

United Kingdom revenues, but there can be no question of making any part of these

revenues directly available to the devolved administrations.

I i      -...-.-I + &apos;^C3

In addition to the major indi&apos;/idual sources of revenue discussed in preceding

I I Paragraphs a number of possible minor sources have been identified^   Most suffer

I ^oni the difficulty that collection costs would prcbably be high in relation to

II yiel-d.   A. problem affecting their use in combination is that the greater the

I I  -umoer of sources of revenue the higher the collection costs for any given total

I collected.


_54  Possibilities which have been examined include supplements to existing

1  cting and gaming taxes; a supplement to vehicle excise duty on motor cars;

a tax on overnight stops in hotels and guesthouses; a tax on television licences;

and a tax on premises which require to be licensed - chiefly those selling

alcohol or motor spirit or used for betting and gaming,   Rough calculations

have been made of the yield to be expected from such measures.

55. Supplements to betting and gaming duties would not produce much revenue

since pool-betting is substantially based in England, while the transfer of

off-course betting through the &apos;laying off* of bets could equally disperse

any tax base for a Scottish or Welsh supplement.   As to other duties in this

field, a 10per cent supplement on the taxation of casinos, bingo, gaming machines

and on course betting would produce as little as  0.4m in Scotland and  0.2m in

Wales.

56. A supplement of  10 a year on vehicle excise duty on private motor cars

would on current registrations produce, without deduction for collection charges,

a revenue of about  10 million in Scotland and  7 million in Hales. (Because

of industrial policy and ESC requirements, vehicle excise duties on commercial

vehicles need to remain the responsibility of the Government.)

57    A surcharge of 25per cent on television licence fees, again without

allowing for collection charges, would bring in about  5 million in Scotland

arid  2.5 million in Wales*

58*   A charge of 20p per night spent in hotels or guest houses might produce, a

gross yield of  4*5 million in Scotland and  3-4 million in Wales, but a

large part of this would almost certainly be offset by the cost of the collection

arrangement s.

59 The turnover of premises licensed to sell alcoholic liquors is estimated at

 510 million in Scotland and  240 million in Wales: a tax equivalent in total

yield to 2 per cent of sales would accordingly produce about  10 million in

Sootland and  4*5 million in Hales*


50.  All of those figures are small in relation to the total of devolved

expenditure*   If the Government&apos;s proposals had been in operation at the time

this would have been over  2600 million in 1975-76 in Scotland and over

 1100 million in Wales.   Moreover, the Government have concltided, after

careful consideration, that each of these &quot;minor&quot; possibilities is subject to

cogent objections - whether of unfair incidence on the people of Scotland or

Wales; of administrative complexity, or of prospectively high collection costs

in relation to likely revenue.   Indeed, each of these possibilities seems likely

to fail c-   the final test listed -.jji paragraph 25, the test of political possibility

Summary of Part land Conclusions

61%   The Government intend to provide for block funds to be voted by the House of

Commons to finance thd devolved services.   The Government believe this expenditure

based system of finance to be compatible with continuing political and economic

unity whereas a system which related spending on the devolved services to revenue

raised in Sootland and Wales would not be. (Paragraphs 5 - 17).

62. It would be possible in theory to assign certain United Kingdom revenues to

the devolved administrations as of right. But this course would create a number

of difficulties and the Government   see no advantage in it. (Paragraphs -\Q - 21)

63. The Government are not opposed in principle to providing the devolved

administrations with marginal ta.x powers for supplementing the block funds.

There are criteria (set out in paragraph 23)with which marginal tax powers

would have to conform if their use was to be politically&apos;practicable. (Paragraphs

23-23)


64.   The Government have again reviewed the scope for devolving

marginal tax powers including a supplementary income tax (paragraphs

30   39), a supplementary value added tax or sales taxes (paragraphs

40   45)t a ^ 3&quot;y- on ^he occupation of property (paragraphs 46 and 47) &gt;

supplemento.ry taxes on companies (paragraphs 48   50) .and a mix of

minor possibilities (53 - 59) 

65.   The Government&apos;s conclusion is that,  on balance and talcing into

account the general practicability and likely public acceptability of

each tax method examined, the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.

They accordingly have no proposals for devolving specific tax powers as

a means of supplementing the block fund.   However, if the devolved

administrations wish to have available a limited supplementary tax

power and are ready to meet its administrative cost then the Government

would certainly be Killing to consider sympathetically any such proposals,

other than in relation to offshore oil.


PART II:   EXPENDITURE ARRANGEMENTS

66. As explained in Part I, the Government are convinced that the level of

devolved expenditure in Scotland and Wales must he determined according to

relative needs.   The remaining paragraphs of this White Paper discuss the

assessment of needs and how the level of devolved expenditure might he related

to comparable expenditure elsewhere; as background information, they also give

some relevant figures of expenditure on services proposed for devolution, and

set out the ways in which it is financed.

67. The detailed working of the new arrangements will have to be discussed

with the devolved administrations.   At this stage, proposals must be tentative

only, and they may well need modification in the light of experience.

Assessment of NeecL

68. Since the basis for determining the level of devolved expenditure is to

be an assessment of needs, it is clearly desirable that this assessment should

be as objective and as generally acceptable to Parliament and public opinion

as possible.   Assessing needs and relating them to expenditure are not exact

sciences: a good deal of room for political judgement will always remain. That

is one reason why the Government rejected, in the White Paper of September 1974i

the proposal by the Kilbrandon Commission for an appointed Exchequer Board to

allocate expenditure between the various parts of the United Kingdom: it is

essential that the allocation should be made by democratically elected

representatives.


69    But it would be quite wrong to conclu.de that, because there will be scope

for argument and legitimate differences of view, the determination of the level

of devolved expenditure must be totally subjective and a lasting cause of

argument and disagreement.   No modern federation runs its finances on a pure

revenue basis of the sort described at the beginning of Part I of this Paper.

All attempt :to provide sdme compensation for disparities in resources.   There.may

.frequently be a lively debate about the results of these attempts, but this does not

normally threaten political stability.

70.   Similarly, in the United Kingdom, expenditure has already to be allocated

between the different parts of the country and between different local authorities

and other spending agencies within them.   It must also be allocated between

different expenditure programmes; and this presents problems which are in some

ways analogous to those of regional and local distribution,   All these tasks

involve a great deal of political judgement and offer ample scope for debate.

The results   may be.criticised by various interested parties. But they

are also reasonably acceptable to a wide range of opinion.

71    These considerations suggest that theoretical niceties are much less

important than the existence of a willingness to make the system work, and a

general acceptance that it give?3 broadly fair results.   Without this willingness

and this acceptance constitutional and financial refinements are likely to bo

wasted labour.   The Government are confident that all partners in the devolution

settlement will approach their responsibilities in a spirit of co-operation.

Collection of Data

72.   Nevertheless, it is clearly desirable that discussion of the appropriate

level of devolved expenditure should be_ informed to the greatest possible extent

by objective data and a mutual understanding of needs and problems. Studies

are now being undertaken within Government Departments with the aim of collecting

objective information on needs and standards of public services in all four

countries of the United Kingdom.   The Government hope this information will help

them and the devolved administrations to make informed judgements on levels of

expenditure and to explain them publicly.


73. The Government consider that the provision of a basis of information about

needs and standards of public services could be much assisted by the creation of

an independent advisory body which would collect such information and advise the

Government and the devolved administrations on its implications.   The kind of body

they have in mind would have no executive or arbitral responsibilities.   But they

believe that it would with time become a focus of expertise on the assessment and

comparison of needs and that its guidance could be of great value both to the

Government and to the devolved administrations.   The Government intend to consult

the devolved administrations as soon as they are elected about the possibility of

setting up such a body, the uses which might be made of it and the terms of

reference it might be given.

74. There will in any case have to be regular exchanges of information between

the Government and devolved administrations about the future plans and polices

of both.   Such exchanges are intrinsically desirable as a way of ensuring

that both the Government and the administrations take account of the possible

effects of their plans on other parts of the country, or on national policies.

They will not be a basis for intervention by the Government in decisions

by the administrations, but will be part of the background to the determina-

tion of devolved expenditure, ensuring that the Government has a fair under-

standing of the policies and programmes to which it relates.

AJFonmala Approach

75. The Government recognise that there has&apos; been concern that annual

discussions of levels of devolved expenditure would lead in practice to

detailed scrutiny by Government Departments of individual devolved spending

proposals,   Because at any time the bulk of planned public expenditure in

the near future is already committed, annual discussion of allocations, it

is argued, l^cald tend to concentrate on changes at the margin in devolved

expenditure, and how these compared with similar changes elsewhere in the

country.   Such changes would frequently stem from changes of policy; and so

the Government viould be drawn into discussion of particular devolved policies

or priorities*


76.   Although the Government &quot;believe that these fears have been exaggerated they

accept that it is desirable to build as much stability and certainty as possible

into the financial arrangements for devolution, so as to give the devolved

administrations a firm basis for independently deciding their own plans and

priorities, but without insulating them from the economic and other factors which

are bound to affect public expenditure generally.   A promising approach would be

to relate the total of devolved public expenditure in Scotland or Wales to

comparable expenditure elsewhere in the country   on the basis of relative need,and

to express it as a percentage of comparable expenditure in the country

as a, whole.   The oercentage would be maintained over a stated period, after which

of relative needs.

it would be determined afresh on the same basis/ The period might be four years,

corresponding to the term of the devolved Assemblies.   During that period, it would

not normally be open to a devolved administration to propose an increase, or to the

Government to propose a reduction   in the percentage; but increases or decreases

in the level of comparable expenditure outside Scotland and Wales would automatically

lead to corresponding increases or reductions in devolved expenditure.

/of this sort

77* / It would not be practicable to incorporate    a. formula/in statute* To

V

try to do so would lead at best to extremely cumbersome provisions of doubtful

validity and effectiveness.   Moreover, it would hardly be acceptable to make

increases in devolved public expenditure on account of, for example, major

natural disasters illegal, as they would be if they were inconsistent with

a formula with statutory force.   On the other hand, to write escape clauses

into the legislation would rob the formula of much of its purpose and effect.

78,   .Any formula would therefore have to be non-statutory.   The Government

believe that on this   basis it could well have a valuable influence on the

financial arrangements of devolution.   They therefore intend to   prppose an

approach on the lines set out in paragraph 76 above   to_, the devolved admini-

strations as soon as they are elected.   It is important that their views on

both the general acceptability and the detailed operation of a formula-based

system should be taken into account in the working out of the procedures to

te followedj


Expenditure, on Deyo 1 ve.d Sergioe s

79.   Procedures cannot be judged separately from the job they are designed to do.

On the basis of the proposals in the Scotland and Wales Bill the public expenditure

to which the arrangements with the devolved administrations will relate falls for

the main part within the following programmes:

Roads and transport

Housing

Other environmental services

Law, order and protective services

Education and libraries, science and arts

Health and personal social services

In addition, the devolved administrations will have some responsibilities within

the agriculture, fisheries and forestry programme; and they will be responsible

for expenditure by the Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies, for tourism

and, in Scotland, for the Highlands and Island   Development Board, and, in

Wales, for the Development Board for Rural Wales.   Within the local authority

field the main exception to the sen/ices proposed for devolution is police.

Among other services &apos;-rithin the programmes listed above, but not proposed for

devolution, a.re ports, Crown Prosecutions, universities and science.


80. Table 1 shows that in 1975 76 public expenditure on services proposed

for devolution in the Scotland and bales Bill amounted to about  2,640 million

in Scotland and about  1,160 million in Wales.

    - This represented about 60 per cent of identifiable public expenditure

in Scotland and about 55 per cent of identifiable public expenditure in Wales.

Under the Government&apos;s proposals, the Scottish Executive and the Welsh Assembly

will become responsible for allocating expenditure between devolved services.

Because the extent to which services are proposed for devolution to Scotland

and Wales differs, the figures shown for Scotland are not always precisely

comparable with those for Wales.   The main difference relates to expenditure

within the law, order and protective services programme.   This programme is to

be devolved in Scotland, only, except for some local a.uthority services, such as

fire services, which are also to be devolved to the Welsh Assembly.

81. To put the figures in context and to allow the scale of prospective devolved

expenditure to be compared both with total identifiable expenditure in Scotland

and Kales and with expenditure on individual programmes, Table 2 sets out the

(5)

relevant figures     .   Similar figures are also given for other parts of the United

Kingdom and for the United Kingdom as a whole. These must be interpreted with

caption since the causes for the differences between them are varied and complex.

For example, geographical or demographic factors or differences in economic

structure may affect the amount of expenditure in the case of programmes such as

health and personal social services and agriculture, fisheries, food and forestry.

Similarly differences in the levels of economic activity and unemployment affect

levels of spending on regional and industrial assistance in the trade, industry

and employment programme.

(5)

&quot;Identifiable public expenditure&quot; means expenditure which can be identified from

official records as having been incurred in each country, but excluding

expenditure on defence, overseas services and debt interest. This is excluded

because much of it cannot be identified from official records as having been

incurred in a particular country and because, even where it can, it would be

misleading to attribute expenditure incurred on behalf of the United as a whole

to particular parts of it. The extent to which expenditure on other services can

oe identifed varies between countries, and the coverage of the figures may

therefore vary even where similar services are being provided


82. Even within each programme, the.figures for each of the four countries

undoubtedly take account of a mass of variations between the different regions

within them.   Detailed figures for individual regions are not available, but the

differences between them might well turn out to be as great or greater than

those between the four countries each taken as a whole.

FINANCING DEVOLVED EXPENDITURE

83. The block funds to be paid to the devolved administrations will not be the

only source of expenditure for the devolved services; and in order to determine

the amount of the block funds it will be necessary to break planned expenditure

down&apos;into different components and to take account of the sources of finance

available for each.   The main sources (other than the block fund itself) are

local authority rates, borrowing, and the internal resources of public corporations.

It will slso be necessary to take account of cash flows which are excluded from

public expenditure: by far the most important of these are local authority loan

charges.

84. The methods for determining what part of devolved expenditure is to be met by

the block funds will need to be discussed with the devolved administrations. This

will involve assumptions as to the amounts of capital expenditure by local

authorities and public corporations to be met by borrowing and as to the total

contribution to be expected from local authority rates.   In assessing the

assumed contribution from rates the Government will need to decide whether it is

fair, compared with the expected level of rate income in England, and allowing

for any special circumstances.   It will then be for the devolved administrations

in further discussions with their own local authority associations to determine

what assumptions should actually temade about rates in the statutory settlement

of rate support grant.

85. After consulting the devolved administrations the Government will need to

determine two sets of figures and they intend that the devolution legislation

should provide for securing the approval of Parliament for them.   The first

will be the block fund which will cover primarily the current and direct capital

expenditure of the devolved administration itself (including it3 expenditure cn

rate support for local authorities). The second will be a limit on total caoital


expenditure on devolved services by local authorities and public corporations,

which is financed from boirowing and requires authorisation by the Scottish

Executive or the Welsh Assembly.

86. The devolution legislation will provide for the Government to announce

the results of their decisions on these matters in reports to be presented to

the House of Commons when approval is sought for draft orders making the

necessary provision.

87. It would be idle to speculate on the results of this system in future years

since it is impossible to anticipate the outcome of discussions with the devolved

administrations.   However, it is possible to bring together figures for a past

year as a rough indication of how the proposed arrangements might work. Obviously

there are problems in attempting to calculate from historical data how expenditure

on devolved services would have been financed if the Government&apos;s proposals had

been in operation in the past.   But it is possible, by assuming that expenditure

on devolved services would have been equivalent to the expenditure which was in

fact incurred in a given year and that the same patterns of financing would have

applied, to make rough estimates of the amounts of the two block funds.

88. Table 3 presents estimates for 1975-76 calculated on these assumptions. It

divides public expenditure by spending authority and then shews how it was

financed in 1975-76.   Since some expenditure on non-devolved services will be

borne by local authorities, and so fall on the rates, it will be necessary

to take account of it when calculating the block funds so far as it is not met

from specific grants from the Government.

89. On this basis, it is estimated that if the proposed system had been in

operation in 1975-76 the block fund for Scotland would have amounted to about

  1,870 million and the block fund for Wales to about  870 million. Thu3,

about 70 per cent of expenditure on devolved services in Scotland and about

75 per cent of expenditure on devolved services in Wales in 1975-76 would have

been met from the block funds.

90. Under the Government s proposals    local authorities in Scotland and Wales

will continue to have access to the Public Works Loan B)ard and to financial

markets in the United Kingdom and overseas.   However, public corporations

operating in devolved subject fields will borrow from the Scottish or Welsh


Loans Funds instead of.    from the National Loans Fund.   The amount of borrowing

which in 1975-76 would have counted against the annual limitc;   on capital

expenditure financed by borrowing is shown in Part E of Table 3.   The devolved

administrations themselves will have no long-term borrowing powers; their

capital expenditure will be met out of the block funds.

Sa-5.IA.PY OF PART II AND CONCLUSIONS

91.   The Government see no reason why determining the level of devolved

expenditure in Scotland and Hales according to relative needs should be a cause

of especial political dispute.   Nevertheless, in order to minimise any risks,

studies are in hand on the collection of objective information on needs and

standards of public services.   The Government intend to explore v/ith the devolved

administrations the scope for an independent advisory body and for a formula under

which devolved expenditure would be settled for a period of, say, four years ahead

as a percentage of comparable expenditure in the country as a whole, (paragraphs

66 to 78).

in the Scotland and Hales Bill

92. Expenditure on services proposed for devolution/amounted to about  2640

million in Scotland in 1975-76 and about  1160 million in Wales. Scottish

and Welsh shares of United Kingdom public expenditure vary as between different

subject programmes (paragraphs 79 to 82, Tables 1 and 2).

93. Public expenditure on devolved services will be met not only from block funds

to be approved by the House of Commons but also in part from local authority-

rates, borrowing and the internal resources of public corporations.   It is

estimated that in 1975-/6 the block fund would - on certain assumptions about

spending and financing - have covered about 70 per cent of devolved expenditure

in Scotland and 75 per cent in Wales, (paragraphs 8.3 to 90, Table 3).

notes pit table 1

(1) In most cases it is relatively easy to provide estimates of

expenditure on services proposed for devolution since much of

it now falls within the responsibilities of the Secretaries of

State for Scotland and Wales.   However, this statement is subject

to two qualifications.   First,  some expenditure,  for example on

office accommodation and stationery, has hitherto been provided as

a &quot;common service&quot; without payment by the recipient Government

department.   The allocation between countries cannot be precisely

estimated and the estimates included in this table are therefore

approximate.   Secondly, some programmes are run for England and

Wales together.   Teacher training and further education are the

main examples.   This presents some problems of estimation which do

not apply to the Scottish figures.

(2) Because the extent to which services proposed for devolution to

Scotland and Wales differs, the figures shown for Scotland are

not always precisely comparable with those for Wales.   As noted in

paragraph 79 of the White Paper, this programme is to be devolved

only in Scotland except for some local authority services, such

as fire services, which are also to be devolved to the Welsh Assembly.

(3) In this table public corporations&apos; capital expenditure relates

mainly to capital expenditure by the New Town Development Corporations,

the Scottish Special Housing Association and the Welsh National Water

Development Authority..    It excludes capital expenditure by nationalised

industries.
