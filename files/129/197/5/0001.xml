CONFIDENTIAL19 77 PESC REPORTTHE AID PROGRAMME 1978-9 TO 1981-82MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENTSUMMARY1.      If we are to meet all existing aid commitments, to make at least a reasonable minimum response to the new demands that are bound to arise in the present international climate,  and to show that we aremaking visible progress towards the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNPfor aid flows, the volume of our aid must be increased above the levelscontained in the current PESC Report.    It is also in our economicself-interest to be able to increase our aid as part of theinternational effort to combat world-wide deflation stemming from theOPEC surpluses.2.      The effect of the December cuts of around 10 per cent  ( 50 million)in the aid programme for 19 77-8 and 19 78-9 has been to reduce toa&apos; minimum, my ability to deal with new demands this year and next.    Afterproviding for the commitments we already have, the unallocated reserve in the programme is barely adequate to meet normal contingencies.I have agreed to set aside  25 million of the bilateral aid programme for projects related to our commercial interests, and I have also hadto meet several unforeseen demands upon the programme, to which - fora combination of political and economic reasons - the Governmentnaturally wished to respond,3.      I expect others.    Their timing and size is uncertain but among those that can be foreseen are:-(i) the Zimbabwe Fund (a potentially very large commitment,where the first contributions may arise next year)  and otherincreases in assistance in Southern Africa related to the rhodesian situation;(ii) assistance to countries not normally justified under our aid strategy, such as Portugal  (where I have agreed to provide$15 million)  or Gibraltar;(iii) any aid elements arising out of the UNCTAD integratedcommodity programme and possibly some subsidy for the poorest countries in any extended scheme of export earnings stabilisation.
We originally accepted the Special Action proposal in CIEC(under which we agreed to contribute $115 million of quick disbursingaid through IDA)  on the basis that the sums needed could be foundwithin the existing programmes.    Not only will this be difficult,given other new demands, but we are increasingly being pressed inParliament and various international bodies to show that this reallyconstitutes additional aid.    It is impossible to show this without some increase beyond the present run of PESC figures.5.      At the various major meetings this year - notably the downing street Summit, the CIEC and the Commonwealth Heads of Governmentmeeting, we - with other donors - have accepted publicly the need toincrease aid flows substantially.    Since we accepted in 1974 theUN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for official aid, we have been ableto make very little progress towards it.    In 1974 we achieved 0.37 percent and in 1976 we had only got to 0.38 per cent (as far back as .1964we were at 0.52 per cent).    Other major donors, notably the japanese and Americans, have stated their intention to make substantial increases over the next few years.    We risk being left well be(The American intention at the moment is to try to double the;.:, aidover the next four years.)    It will also be harder to continue toshift the balance of our aid further towards the poorest if we haveto accommodate the new demands I have listed within the PESC proposals-6.      I believe that increased assistance for third world development is critical for the world economy as a whole, and for our own prospects of recovery from recession.    The OPEC surpluses create correspondingdeficits elsewhere, and given the unwillingness of OECD countriescollectively to run such deficits, they will fall on the developing countries, leading to low rates of world economic growth.    Our ownprospects lie in increased exports, and in higher world growth rates.Aid, and UK aid in particular, cannot resolve this problem.    But itis one element, and an important one, and the benefits we shallderive from my proposals are likely to be significantly larger interms of our own self-interest than the expenditure involved.conclusion.      The run of figures shown in the PESC Report: m at 19 77 prices1978-9        1979-80        1980-81        1981-82663.1 711.1 756.7 756.7is not enough to meet the calls likely to be made on the aid prooramroeand provides little, if any, scope for new commitments or initiativesbefore 1980-81.    (Any further reduction in the aid programme wouldmake it impossible to maintain an unallocated margin adequate for eve^the likely priority contingencies.)    /although my officials have putforward estimates of the additional funds required to meetdisbursements on new developments over the period 1979-80 to 1981-82within the PESC guidelines, those additions, even if agreed by mycolleagues, would not meet the additional demands I have outlined.My conclusion is that if we are to be able to meet them, and are tocontinue to implement the agreed aid strategy, and be seen to be/making
making a credible contribution to increasing aid flows, we need to restore the 1978-79 cut and to move on upwards from there and thatthe run of figures in the Survey Report should be amended to:Em at 1977 prices1978-79        1979-80        1980-81        1981-82730 775 820 870On this basis, and taking conservative assumptions concerning our owngrowth of GNP, we could hope for a possible progression to 0.6 per cent of GNP in 19 81/82  : still short of the target, but at least makingreal movement towards it.J H4 July 19 77
