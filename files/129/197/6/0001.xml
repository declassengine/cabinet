document is the property of her britannic majestvs government cp(77) 76v   &apos; copy no      g 25 July 1977cabinetRHODESIA: A NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENTNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs. At the recent meeting of Heads of Commonwealth Governments theAnglo/United States initiative received a grudging welcome.    It is evidentthat we are being given one last chance to promote a negotiated settleme nt.If we fail, the pressures on us will grow to apply a full range of economic sanctions against South Africa and to back the armed struggle.    We couldlose control of the situation.    The United States Administration may wellsupport calls for action against South Africa which would place us in anappalling dilemma. We might have to choose between putting at risk ourvaluable economic relationship with South Africa or our economic links with black Africa.2. On the surface, the white Rhodesians may appear confident that theycan hold nut for some considerable time.    In reality, however, the moodamong Europeans is one of increasing despondency.    This is evidenced bythe growing rate of white emigration.    The Smith regime are continuing to plan attacks similar to the ones which they mounted recently againstMozambique, and recently came vary close to attacking Zambia.    Thisescalation of the violence enhances the chance of expanding existing Cubaninvolvement in Mozambique and the Cubans have offered to put troops intoZambia.    This can only further increase Soviet influence.3. We may have time to continue to negotiate on the basis of constitutional changes passing through the House of Commons in the 1977-78Session and an orderly transfer of power in the middle to end of 1978.However, events may move far more rapidly than this.    There could even be a collapse of the existing Rhodesian Front.    This would place us in avery difficult position.    We could not be compelled to assume power in rhodesia, but the political pressures on us to intervene would be very great.The way would be open for the guerillas to seize power by force and therival armies might start fighting it out among themselves.    In addition, theSouth African Government might come under domestic pressure to intervene.Anarchy, or an international!sation of the war, could be the result.1
4. Despxte the difficulties, it is in our own national interest to workfor a negotiated settlement and we must now move as rapidly as we car todecide on a settlement package, at least in outline, by the middle of July.I here are four elements to any settlement package: -i. Constitutionii. Transitioniii. Independenceiv. Sanctions5. The United States and ourselves are close to total agreement oni. and iii.    The Constitution will be based on universal suffrage and willhave a justiciable Bill of Rights, backed up by an independent judiciary.As part of a constitutional settlement a Zimbabwe Government wouldformally take over the pension obligations and formally guarantee somesecurity of tenure for farmers who did not take Zimbabwe citizenship.A Zimbabwe Development Fund, hopefully totalling $1.2 billion, would beestablished on lines agreed by Cabinet in 1976 and involving the same UnitedKingdom contribution.    It would be designed to be as similar to aconventional aid operation as possible.    It would, however, be enabled toprovide balance of payments support through &quot;programme aid&quot; which wouldmake it possible for a Zimbabwe Government to pay pensions in foreign currency and allow other remittances abroad.    It would be our intention that, if a future Zimbabwe Government failed to fulfil its obligations, then the resources of the Fund could be withdrawn.    This is likely to be a stronger safeguard than any blocking mechanism in Parliament, whichexperience shows can easily be repealed or overruled.6. The fundamental assumptions for any negotiated settlement are thatall the parties namely Mr Ian Smith and the Rhodesian Front regime, thePatriotic Front and the other Nationalist Groups, Bishop Muzorewa and theReverend Sithole will agree to a package which will include all of thefollowing five elements: -i.       Agreement on the terms of the independence constitution for Zimbabwe.ii.       Agreement to the appointment of a British resident commissioner to govern the country from Transfer day andsupervise an election prior to independence which must takeplace within six months.iii. Agreement that Mr Smith will leave office and that theRhode sian Front will vacate power by Transfer day.iv. Agreement from the Rhode sian Armed Forces and the liberation Armies that they will accept the authority of the resident Commissioner and that there will be a cease-fire atTransfer day.
v.       Agreement from the Front Line Presidents that as fromTransfer day at the latest they will not harbour or give support to guerillas who engage in warlike activity.The South African Governments attitude is crucial.    At present it is clearthey want a negotiated settlement and, if the package is reasonable, thereis a good chance that rather than risk United States support for united nations sanctions they would bring pressure on the Rhodesians to settle.7. The other remaining major issue before being able t&amp; pie sent a balanced settlement package is hqw to ensure law and order during the transition period.    The existing Police force is broadly acceptable to theNationalist leaders bat the Rhodesian Armed Forces is not acceptable.There are two main options which are being discussed with the PatrioticFront and the Rhodesiau Front and in interdepartmental working parties:-i.       Direct negotiations between the Rhode sian Armed Force cand the Liberation Armies prior to Transfer Day.    Rhode sianArmed Forces would be progressively reduced to an agreedresidual strength and would be progressively integrated with the liberation Forces to form a single Zimbabwe Defence Force withan agreed strength by Independence Day.ii.       Rhodesian Armed Forces would be suspended from activeduty on Transfer Day and disbandment begun under the directionof the Resident Commissioner.    Re-establishment of selectedelements prepared to accept the authority of the resident commissioner and to serve in the armed forces of an independentZimbabwe.    The Liberation Army guerillas to be enlisted on similar terms.Direct negotiations (7 i. ) are unlikely to be feasible although a somewhat similar arrangement was negotiated in Mozambique.    The white Rhodesiansare likely to be very resistant to losing the protection of the presentefficient armed forces.    Prominent Generals have made clear that they owetheir allegiance to any legitimate government and are not political.    Itseems Mr Smith would agree that some elements:  Senior Commanders andthe three SAS squadrons and the Special Branch would have to be dismantledeven prior to Transfer Day.    The Patriotic Front leaders and LiberationArmy Commanders, however, demand total disbandment and replacementby their guerilla forces and are likely to be supported by the Front LinePresidents and other African leaders.8. Consideration is now being given to providing transitional military support, either from the Commonwealth or the United Nations.    The size of the support, whether purely command and training, or with a wider lawand order role, is being carefully considered in an inter-departmentalworking group and preliminary soundings are being taken of the Nigerians,whose attitude is crucial, and the United States for transport and logisticalsupport.    In any Commonwealth option the British contribution would not be
dominant.    This would be the role given to the black Africans and we would need contributions from the white Commonwealth to match our own.    TheUnited Nations option would be less acceptable to white Rhodesians and could run up against a Soviet veto.    It would be hard, but theoreticallypossible, to resiot demands for British troops to participate.9. Sanctions (4 iv.) to enforce a negotiated settlement, demanded as aresult of escalating violence, pose very great problems.    The only seriousadditional sanction which is likely at some stage to be supported by theUnited States and probably France is the imposition of some form of oilsanctions on any country which supplies oil to Rhodesia.    There is already a Chapter VII determination saying that Rhodesia constituted a threat to international peace and security.    For Britain alone to veto such aresolution at the Security Council would provoke severe criticism at homeand abroad and run a risk of retaliatory actions from other Africans.    Thefull implications of sanctions in relation to South Africa are beingseparately studied and my recommendations will come before Cabinet.CONCLUSION10.       We face mounting problems in Southern Africa and there are norisk-free solutions.    Inaction and a refusal to run any risks now couldmean that we face a far worse situation in a few months time.    cabinet is asked to:-a. note the situation over the negotiated settlementpackage (paragraphs 5 and 6) and in particular the difficultissue posed in paragraphs 7 and 8;b. note that a detailed study is taking place over united nations sanctions in relation to Southern Africa (paragraph 9);c. note that any final decisions will come to Cabinet.D A L OForeign and Commonwealth office July 19774
