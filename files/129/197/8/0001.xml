f O     f** n TT^ Wednesday 13th July,X-. io.uu noursMAINTAINING THE ATTACK ON INFLATION1.     The Government is determined to create a fairer and more-prosperous Britain.    We can only succeed in this objective if wedefeat -inflation.    We do not pursue the defeat of inflation becauseof some theory held in Government or as an end in itself.    It isthe necessary precondition to success in all our other policies andendeavours.    It is essential if we are to secure the stablefoundations for the future economic prosperity and social cohesionof this country.2.      In the last two years, Government, trade unions, employers andall other sections of our people together have brought this countryback from the brink of runaway inflation which followed the oilcrisis of 1973.    The annual rate of inflation has been reduced by10 per cent from its 1975 peak.    From a situation where Britonswere spending far more than they were earning, living standardshave been restrained into line with what can be afforded.    Thisachievement owes much to the remarkable self-discipline and publicspirit of the British trade union movement which nas earned theadmiration of the entire democratic world.3.      Between the first half of 1976 and the first half of 1977real take-home pay fell by 5 per cent.    Millions of working people and their families shared in this sacrifice.    The Government actedto help the most vulnerable in our society during this harshPeriod:    the living standards of the very poorest, the old, the sick and the unemployed were deliberately maintained, and those atwork contributed to this.    The way in which these burdens havebeen accepted is a great tribute to the restraint, the maturityand commonsense of the British people.^ -      Our success in countering inflation so far has greatly improved our economic prospects.    Combined with the other measures taken by the Government, international confidence has been restored.    The exchange rate has been stabilised.    Britain&apos;s foreign exchange reserves have risen dramatically.    Interest rateshave declined rapidly this year.    Our balance -of payments has improved, not only because of the growing benefits from North sea:i-l, but also because of increases in earnings from exports otherthan
5.     This year, however, there have been setbacks in our attempts further to reduce the level of price increases.    The main reason has been the depreciation of sterling, which has added at least ^ per cent to pricesover the last 12 months.    The cuts in the public sector borrowing requirement necessary to restore confidence and give priority to industry, have made it necessary to reduce subsidies and raise someindirect taxes, and have thus led to a once-and-for-all addition to someprices.    Higher world food, prices, most strikingly tea and coffee, andthe effects of last year&apos;s drought which alone added 5 per cent to britain&apos;s food prices, have been additional, and in most casesuncontrollable, developments.    As the table at Annex B shows, all thishas meant that our inflation rate is still far above those of our maincompetitors, who are themselves making every effort to curb their more moderate rates.favouryuie.    The 1976 depreciation of sterling is by now almost fullyreflected in prices, and since the autumn the exchange rate has beenstrong.    In recent months world commodity prices have stopped movingagainst us.    We can hope to avoid again the extremely high prices ofvegetables arid other fresh foods which resulted from last year&apos;sdrought.    We are getting the benefits of lower interest rates;    lowerbuilding society mortgage rates have already helped millions of peopleborrowing to buy their own homes.1.     The period of falling living standards now lies behind us, and atime of great opportunity faces this nation.    We can achieve a period ofsustained higher economic growth.    This will offer benefits to our people:    higher living standards, and more jobs;    more prosperity for0Ur industries.    To this Government such growth would provide thepfcsources necessary for its policies aimed at creating a more just, as&apos;&quot;ell as a more prosperous society.8.     But the opportunities and benefits which could be open to us all,could equally be thrown away.    The main threat is a resurgence of higherlriflation, eroding the competitiveness of our industries, creating^employment, hurting the most vulnerable section of our community, and, 6ven threatening the political system and social fabric of this country.
9.    Pay settlements are not of course the sole cause of inflation, as our experience in 1976-77 demonstrated.    Butinflation will follow excessive settlements as surelyas the night follows day.10.    The Government accepts and has anticipated that a thirdyear of closely structured pay policy is not practicable oracceptable.    There must be scope for reducing the rigiditiesarid distortions which have accumulated over the past twoyears.    Thus the problem which faces us in the year aheadis how to secure moderate wage settlements at a time when thereis a return to orderly free collective bargaining.    ThatReturn to collective bargaining must be managed in such away that it does not throw away both the great achievementsin countering inflation since 1975 and the great prospectsfcr this nation-in the years ahead.    It is a problem whichfaces us all.    Its solution will involve us all.    If wefail the price will be paid by all - though most of all by those who are least able to bear it.H.    The rest of this White Paper sets out how the Governmenttafter consultations with the trades unions and the CEI?1sees the path to further progress in defeating inflation inthe year ahead.
THE YEAE BEGINNING AUGUST 1977PAY[The following section is being substantially revised]12.    If we are to secure the deceleration of inflation to singlefigures during the first half of 1978, with all that means forthe country and its economy, the earnings increase in the year from August 1977 should not exceed 10%.      In the last two years the guidelines on pay which the TUC have been able to issue inagreement with the Government, and which have been loyally observecby the trade union movement, have made a major contribution to thedeceleration of inflation.    In particular, the single figureearnings increase we are likely to achieve under the  2.S0/3%/ 4relic-&quot;- &quot;ill give us single figure inflation in the first half cfnext year-, provided earnings increases remain moderate after July13.   It was not to be expected that there could be a third year ofrigid and closely structured pay policy on the lines of those of1975 and 1976.    It has been the policy of the TUC, which theGovernment accept, that the period after July 1977 should be oneof orderly return to normal collective bargaining.14.   The TUC General Council have however published guidance on the strict maintenance.of settlements made under the  2.50/5%/ 4- policy as a means of securing fairness between groups of workers and ofSiving effect to the orderly return to free bargaining.J-2jlonth I nt e rvjaJ^ Bet we c n J3 e 111e ment^s^15.   The Government fully endorse the TUC guidance about adherence^o the 12 month interval between settlements which is set out at annex A to this White Paper.     The guidance says that negotiatorsshould not reopen settlements made -under the  2.5G/%/ A policy^ter 31 July in breach of the 12 months rule;    and should rot deferSJf -F&quot;&quot;1 gioi   ipe. manI v. E*ra     
pa t/trtlm &apos;   m      .   u*-&amp;     it&apos;&quot;&apos;settlements due under that policy until after 31 July in the hopeof securing an advantage by doing so.   Observance of this guidance,which should be adhered to by all those concerned with paydetermination in both the private and the public sectors, is ofcardinal importance for the avoidance of an excessive rate of earnings increase in the year from August 1977*Improvements in Occupational Pension J3chjsjne ^IS.    The TUC guidance provides for two exceptions to adherence tothe 12 months interval between settlemets.    One of these relates to occupational pension schemes and provides that improvements inthese should be negotiable at any time after 31 July 1977*    TheGovernment endorse this removal of limitations on improvements in-^ odnctivity Agreements17.    The other exception to the 12 months interval betweensettlements relates to productivity schemes.   However, such schemesffiust be fully self--financing and in particular must not add to costsso as to give rise to or add to a price increase.     The Governmentis in agreement with this exception also, including the strict-requirement that schemes should be fully self-financing.   VeilPhased and genuine productivity agreements can contribute to theimprovement in productivity and in the utilisation of existinginvestment which the country needs, but they should not be a meansQ  securing pay increases without genuinely matching productivity&apos;Rains.      Agreements of that kind would be unfair to consumers or to0ther groups of workers, and damaging to employment and investment.-General Ley^l^ofJSe^S^ 1977__IS.   In addition to the guidance they have issued on the 12 monthinterval between settlements, the TUC have made clear the importanceQf avoiding a pay explosion   in the period ahead and of achieving
a climate favourable to moderation in pay settlements.  Add reference to any further TUG statement made following meeting with Ministers on lS JulyJ7.19.    The Government consider that it is their responsibility togive some further guidance to all those concerned with paydetermination, and to working people generally, on the level of pay settlements which is in the best interests of our economy and&quot;therefore in their best interests also.    The Government has a dualresponsibility here for the health of the economy as a whole and for&quot;the management of the public sector.20.    If we are to achieve an earnings increase not exceeding 10%in the year ended July 1978, the general level of settlements wil*need to be well within single figures.    The Government recommendthose concerned with pay determination in both the private and thepublic sector to be guided by this requirement.    New settlementsshould be made on the basis that they will last for 12 months.21.   A period of strict pay guidlines has meant that a number ofanomalies in pay arrangements have inevitably accumulated.    Inaddition, negotiators will wish in due course to consolidate existingPay supplements.    It will not be possible to deal with the whole range of these matters in the next 12 months, or even to make a start with all of them.    Only the most serious difficulties can be tackled in the coming year, if necessary on a phased basis and taking full account of the need to keep the general level ofsettlements well within single figures.22.   With an earnings increase not exceeding 10% in the coming yearVJe can expect the annual rate of inflation to reach single figuresduring the first half of 1978.   This would of itself ensure theMaintenance of average living standards for working people, provided the real burden of taxation was not increased&quot; in that period.    In fact&quot;kne tax reliefs and price action described later in this White Paper,Which will take effect in the early autumn, will give substantial
additional protection to living standards, especially to families with children and to those with earnings well below the average.The Government now forecast that by the end of this year prices willbe less than 4% higher than they are now;    and for the greatmajority of workers the tax reliefs end price action will fullyoffset - in many cases by a large margin - that 4% price increase.23.   The guidance for pay settlements in the preceding paragraphsis intended to apply equally in the public and private sectors.The Government will do all it can to secure the application of thisPolicy throughout the public sector.   /&quot;The CBI have informed theGovernment that they are prepared to commend this guidance to memberemployers in both private and. public sectors^&apos;24.    jv, setting the pay of the armed forces, doctors and dentiststurn top bcslaxy groups in the public sector the Government has formany years had A^aluable assistance from the three Salary Reviewbodies.    The task of these bodies has been made more difficult byt*he general pay limits in recent years, and bhe need to reconcile&quot;the national requirement and the interests of the groups concerned.The Government will ask the Review Bodies to continue their taskwithin the context set by this White Paper.JEhe Remuneration, Charges and Grants Act 1975__25The Government will make an Order adding a reference inSection of g  the Remuneration, Charges and Grants Act 1975 *o thelimit represented by the 12 month rule as described in paragraph 15^d in Annex A of this White Paper.    This will release employersfrom any contractual obligations they may have entered   into to theextent that they would breach /&quot;the 12 month rulej7.   /&quot;It will alsomean that the full range of sanctions set out in Cmnd 6151 will appl;&quot;Co breaches of that rule.J7   Moreover, where a firm has reached asettlement which is quite clearly inconsistent with the policies set0^t in this White Paper, the Government will take this into accouir!in tv.v-1.:- -ng p0]icv and the planning of contracts, and. also inlei industrialf c cr p Etm
0 BDIVIDENDS26.   An Order in Council will be introduced to extend dividendcontrols for a further year.    The statutory limit will again be 10%.PRICES2?.   Following many months of heavy increases in prices, especiallyfood prices, the underlying rate of price increase is now easing..During the autumn we can expect to see this reflected in a fall inthe annual rate of inflation.   The Government cannot reinforce thisoy freezing prices generally, last of all the prices of fresh food,or imported goods.    It can however take some steps to bring forwardpart of the benefit of the lower rate oi pri.ce increase, ana tnns toffialce it easier for negotiators to conclude moderate and. responsiblePay settlements in the months immediately ahead.28.   The Government have therefore decided to take action on certainPrices which are directly affected by decisions in the public sectora&amp;d which are particularly burdensome for people on low incomes or with family commitments29.   MiljK is an important item in family budgets especially wherethere are several children.    The Government are therefore increasingthe mil(&amp; subsidy in order to avert the need for an immediate furtherPrice rise of l^p a pint.    The cost will be about  100 million,falling in the financial year 1977-78.30.   Secondly, the Government have decided to raise the incomethreshold for eligibility for free school meals^    The effectv;ill be to increase the number of eligible children to&apos; over1s million,     which will be about one-quarter of those who takeschool meals.     A family with two children will be free of paymentfcr school meals up to earnings of  62 a week,&apos; or about three-quarters of average earnings.    It is estimated that over half a million
additional children and about a quarter of a million extra familieswill benefit.    The cost is estimated at million in 1977-78and  27^ million in a full year.    This proposal will be includedin Regulations to be laid before the House and the Government willbe consulting the local authorities about the financial implicationsand the best method of recompensing them for their additional outlay.31.   An electricity discount scheme will also be operated again this winter in order to relieve households in receipt of family income supplement or supplementary benefits of 2% of one quarter&apos;selectricity bill.   /&quot;Possible addition indicating estimated costand distribution.Jy52.    The total cost of these measures in 1977-78 will be  150 million,35.   The relatively large increases in nationalised industries&apos;Prices price&quot; which were necessary to phase out the massive subsidiesof the early 1970&apos;s and to restore the industries to a more economicfooting are now behind us, and the industries&apos; trading performanceis reflecting the benefit of two years of successful pay policy,With continued, moderation on pay, the industries&apos; future price increases should be much more moderate,   and there are no firmPlans for further major increases before the end of 1977J7. Telephonesubscribers will benefit this autumn from the recently announcedrebate of  7 on their telephone bills and there will be no further increase in charges before April 1978 at the earliest,   The price commission/told the British Gas Corporation that an excess profit of  56.6 million for the year ended 51 March 1977 above the referencelevel permitted by the Price Code must be eliminated before there canbe any further increase in gas prices.34.   The effect of the measures will be to reduce the increase inthe RPI f        per cent below what it would otherwise have been inthe fourth quarter of this year.- gice Control35.   The Price Commission Bill, now completing its Parliamentarystages, provides a more powerful and effective, instrument for
Government intervention against unjustified price increases than has been possible under the system built up since 3-973 by successivePrice Codes.   The new Price Commission will be able to freezeparticular prices for up to 3 months during an investigation, andif the Commission so recommend, the Government will have power toextend the freeze to a year in all.     Distributors&apos; margins may alsobe reduced on the recommendation of the Price Commission after an investigation.     These are tougher powers than the Governmentpossesses at present, and they can be used rigorously in particular cases which call for them without bearing down indiscriminately upontrade and industry.    The Government will also be able to direct theCommission to examine prices and charges across a whole sector,, andwill have powers to order a price freeze or price reductions wherethe Commission so recommend.xn addition the Government will lay before Parliament an order under the Bill to extend for one year the present control over the profit margins of manufacturers, service firms and distributors.This Order will back up the new investigatory powers by providing a general control over prices and a check against any inflationarywidening of profit margins during the coming year.37.    The Price Commission Bill provides an addition new powers to prohibit the abuse of &quot;recommended retail price&quot; recommendations andto require the display of the prices of goods and services.   AnOrder has already been made under existing powers dealing with thedisplay of petrol prices in garages.TAXATION*8&quot;   A number of amendments have been made to the Finance Bill sinceue Budget.    Some of them would have major effects on the revenue.Government have now considered these amendments as a whole inbe light of the economic situation and prospects and with particular reference to the need to keep within the PSBR limits described intb-e Budget statement.idRe 1 )6.
39*     &apos;he reduction in petrol duty to its pre-Budget level will take effect from 6pm on 8 August, and the Chancellor of the Exchequerdoes not intend to look for matching tax increases elsewhere.   TheGovernment accept in principle the view of the House of CommonsStanding Committee which considered the Finance Bill that the incometax personal allowances should he increased further.    In reachingthis conclusion they have also taken account of views expressed tothem by the TUC   However, they consider that the balance of the increases proposed by the Committee is not right and conflicts withthe original intentions of the Budget.4-0,    The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained in his Budget speech in March that he thought it right this year to increase the marriedallowances substantially in order to help the family man during thetr&amp;riRi t i on to the Child Benefit Scheme *   The Standing Committeeamendments however would provide a greater increase in the singlePersonal allowance .     The Government therefore propose to increasethe single personal allowance by  40 and the married person1sallowance by  70 over and above the increases in these allowancesannounced in the Budget speech.     There will be corresponding increasin the wife&apos;s earned income relief, the additional personal allowance for single people with children and the age allowances.     ParticularsQf the changes proposed are set out at Annex C.4-1.   The cost of these changes in a full year over and above the increases proposed in the Budget will be  491 million.     In addition,the Chancellor of the Exchequer will propose a reduction in theDasic rate of income tax by Ip from 35p to 34p.   The. cost of thisdeduction in a full year will be  480 million.    The effect will beto increase to  2?- billion in a full year the income tax reductionsiri this year&apos;s Finance Bill, which is in line with the original intention in the Budget.^- The further income tax reductions will be generally reflectedln Pay packets next month. The reduction in basic rate and in the fate of advanced corporation tax will take effect from 6th April as
Kill the personal allowance changes.    The Inland Revenue willpress notices giving full details.[To be added: A reference to new Annex with figures forthe detailed implications of the pay/tax policies rathe:along the lines of last year&apos;s White Paper.].
SOCIAL BENEFITS4-3.    The policies described earlier in this White Paper on prices and tax reliefs, and indeed on the whole attack on inflation, havebeen designed to give special&apos; help to the low paid, to families,to pensioners and other specially vulnerable sections of thecommunity.   Policies on benefits have been directed to the sameobjectives.Child Benefit;44.    The Government have decided to increase family support in1978-79 by a substantial improvement in the rates of child benefitas part of the further phasing in of the child benefit scheme.Prom April 1978 child benefit rates will be increased from thepresent  1.00 for the first child and  1.50 for subsequent children to  [   ] for all children.   The new rates will result in part from afurther step in the phasing our of child tax allowances, the basiclevel of which will be reduced to I     3 at a net exchequer cost in1978-79 of some [       Jmillion.   Regulations for the new childbenefit rates will be laid shortly and a fuller statement on thelevel of child tax allowances in 1978-79 will be made in due course.45.    This improvement in child benefit will contribute to maintainingor improving the living standards of families in the later part ofthe^period up to July 1978, to which the pay guidance in paragrapht   3 applies.    The child benefit increase will give most help to lower-paid working families who either pay no tax now or will betaken out of tax by the further increases the Government now proposein tax thresholds. ens a10 ns46.    The Government have substantially raised the living standards of retirement pensioners, widows, and the long-term sick and disabled*ue National Insurance pension uprating in November last year broughttbe single pension to  7*55 above its cash level at the time of the
last uprating of the previous administration, representing anincrease in real terms of some 15 per cent.    Over the same period the real value of average pay for -working people remained more0? less constant.    The Government have already announced further increases in National Insurance pensions to.take effect inNovember 1977? which will bring the pension for a married coupleU-P to  28.00 a week, and that for a single person to  17.50.    the increases this autumn should full compensate pensioners for therise in the cost of living over the preceding twelve months.    In   .addition introductory work on the new pension scheme (Better Pensions)which comes into force in April 1978 is well advanced.EMPLOmENT AND THE INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY^7*-    Since the White Paper of November 1975, we have made greatstrides in developing the industrial strategy.    This is based ontripartite working parties, which have examined the opportunitiesJ-0r improving domestic and export market shares in their sectorsQ  manufacturing industry, and the implications for output, investment*r*d manpower.   They have already made a considerable impact on government thinking, and will be producing their first full reportsat the end of the year. There has been a useful improvementRecently in the competitive performance of manufacturing industry;ljl the second, quarter there was a strong increa.se in the volume of manufactured exports, whilst imports of finished goods (excludingspecial North Sea equipment) fell.The Government is assisting industrial investment through the*r*dustry Acts and the National Enterprise Board, and manufacturing^Vestment is now expected to be 6 - 10% higher this year than last.,^ere has been a review of requirements for early additional^Penditure provision, in support of the industrial strategy.   As ae.sult, a further cash sum of  70 million wall be provided, to be. *awn down over the next few years.    Of this,  40 million will be allocated to the Ferrous Foundry industry scheme, where the response*W    1*0..   \Mi
from firms has opened up the prospect of important industrialmodernisation.      Secondly, a further  10 million will be allocated to the Machine Tools industry scheme, reflecting an increase in theindustry-s response.      (Following discussion with the e.c. Commissionon these two proposals, agreement to their introduction is expectedshortly.)      Thirdly, a Produce and Process Development scheme is to- be introduced, for which  20 million will be made available in thefirst instance, to provide more widely based support in this area.The Secretary of State for Industry is issuing separate detailedguidance on this new measure, which responds to a need identified in anumber of Sector Working Parties.]&apos;9.    On the employment side; while unemployment remains too high,in the UK as In many other countries, the - Government has taken anumber of steps to ameliorate its worst effects particularly amongthe young.      In manufacturing industry, over the past year to April,the number of people employed has risen by about 100,000, andthis has helped to offset the rise In the working population.      Inthe construction industry., however, emloyment has fallen.      InEdition to the  100 million for inner cities announced in.VhBudget3 the Government has therefore decided to approve up tofurther-   C -i rvn     s -   -x.^; uctmeu go approve up to aurther  100 rnil.li.on for expenditure on construction in the currentnancial year.      This will help to maintain employment at a difficultme before &quot;one effects of the forecast rise in private sector demandieit m the industry.PUBLIC EXPENDITURE^&apos;    The Government will maintain firm policies concerning publicctor expenditure.      This is a key element in the campaign against1hfination.   .The additional expenditure in the current financial year onthe&apos; *   measures announced in this White Paper will be found fromim the contingency reserve.      No change will therefore be required*n fh.    ine planned total for public expenditure in the current year.elementary Estimates will be presented to Parliament as appropriate.
rsn tagM \EZ    eSu. EZ 8 )52.   The expenditure programmes Tor 1978-79 will be affected by thedecisions now announced concerning child benefit and school meals and the industry schemes.   The Government1s provisional plans forthat year were published in the January public expenditure white paper (Cmnd 6721).    For total public expenditure that White Paperremains the basis for planning.   The programmes will be reviewed in detail in the regular annual survey before publication of thenext public expenditure White Paper.^sh^i^itgThe cash limits which apply to extensive areas of public expenditure will be set consistently with the policies of thi-WUite Paper.For 1977-73, the cash limits have already been, fixed and published in. Cmnd 6767.    No general changes are planned in thelimits.   Per 1978-79 the Government will be announcing the cashlimits in time for the start of the new financial year.    the assumptions used will reflect the Government&apos;s policy on pay.Spending authorities will not be able to rely on supplementaryprovision beyond, the cash limits.T^PUBLIC SECTOR EORROWINGJ^T^Tjtf^55.   nnle Government forecast last spring that, if their budget proposals were implemented in full, the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBP,&apos;) for 1977-78 would.amount to some  3.5 billion,well within the limit of  3,7 billion announced last December at^e time of the agreement with the IMP.    Developments in the economy-nee the spring point to a reduction in the original forecast.Si56,meThey estimate that, after allowance has been, made for all theasures announced, in this White Paper, the PSBR will not exceed .Budget estimate of  8.5 billion.    As explained above, theEditions to public expenditure this year will be found from within&quot;the contingency reserve.    The tax measures outlined, in this White^Per imply a net addition of [    J to the PSBR for the current year*s compared with the Budget proposals.    In deciding on the
SECRETof tax reliefs they could propose the Government have taken accountof the progress achieved on the balance of payments since the budget of the guidance given by the TUC for a phased and orderly return to normal collective bargaining and of the revised, prospect for thePSBR in 1977/78.[THE BALANCE OF PAYTIENTS AND THE RESERVES57.   Last year, with confidence at a low ebb, the current account-deficit of  AX billion was swelled by over  2 billion of outflowsreflecting a jack of confidence in our ability to run our affairsProperly and get a grip on inflation.    The exchange rate againstthe dollar was at one time as low as 01.55 and the reserves declined to an all time low of  2J billion.    This year the position has beentransformed.    The current account is now roughly in balance and theresurgence of confidence has been such that we have already made up all the ground lost in. 1976.    The exchange rate has recoveredand stabilised at around the present rate and the reserves standat an all time high of  6  billion.]MONETARY POLICY58.The Government will maintain the limits they set last Decrepeated in the Budget for the PSBR and foremberExtmansion (ECE&quot;)Domestic credit for the year to mid-April 1977 Domestic Credit Expansion was 4.6 billion compared with the limit of  9 billion and the. growth0- Sterling M3 8% compared with the forecast range of 9% - 13$.&quot;bo outcome for DCE in the second half of 1976/77 was due partly tothe ending of Sterling finance for third country trade and partly^0 the unwinding of &quot;loads and lags&quot; built up earlier in the year.
(secret)60.    For 1977/73 the Budget forecast was that DCE for 1977/78 wouldbe comfortably within the limit of  7-7 billion.    The correspondinggrowth ot Sterling M3 was forecast to be in the range 9% - 13%.During the first 2 months of the financial year the outturn for therjCE and for Sterling M3 has been closely in line with the Budgetforecasts.CONCLUSION:    THE OPPORTUNITY AHEAD6l.    The prospects for the UK economy have been transformed as aresult of the adjustments of the past two years.    Sterling, isstable, input prices to industry have actually fallen in the lasttwo months, interest rates are down, including mortgage rates,.andwith the increasing flow of North Sea oil we can look forward to aPeriod of years when it. should be possible to avoid balance ofPayments crises and the consequent cutbacks in demand which have1 inhibited investment and growth.Lc-    None of these gains can be held unless inflation is brought down to a tolerable level in line with our industrial competitors,hut if we succeed in the attack on inflation we have before us the prospect of a sustained period in which we can combine steady- growth of our cutout, of employment, and of our living standards.The measures we have presented in this paper underline theGovernment&apos;s determination to achieve those goals and we are sure that trade unionists in preparing their negotiating positions- -for -the next round will take account of them and will realise thatModeration at this stage is in the continued interest of their* embers.    If they are ready to settle for moderate pay risesL&apos;hen there is a real prospect of steadily rising living standardsrom next year onwards.    If, on the other hand, settlements wereto escalate into a free-for-all the benefits would be fritteredK&amp;y and there would Vie no guarantee that living, standards couldc sustained.    We are faced with an opportunity which the British economy has not seen for very many years.    With the support of thetrade union movement, employers and of the ordinary working people0f Britain we are confident that a great prize is within our grasp.
ANNEX   ATUG PAY GUIDANCEThe 12 month interval between settlementsOn 22 June .1977 the General Council of the TUC issued thefollowing statement, which the   Government fully endorse the General Council attach the utmost importanceto the continued observance by negotiators of theguidelines of the  2.50/5%/ 4 policy adopted by-Congress and without exception honoured insettlements so far reached by affliliated unions,including the requirement of a 12 month interval between settlements.    It would not be compatible with those guidelines for negotiators to reopensettlements reached under them after July Jl in breach of the 12 month rule;   nor would the general council - accept that negotiators could defer duesettlements under the current policy until afterJuly 51 in the hope of securing an advantage over -the majority of workers who have already settledunder the policy.

v.       Ministers from the non-industrial Departments should attendNEDC from time to time to discuss their contribution to theindustrial strategy.10.        We propose that the long-term problems which should in the firstinstance be the subject of further consideration should be:i. Employment of graduates by industry (paragraph 1. 9).ii. Public sector manpower policy (paragraph 1.15).iii. Social security and tax in relation to work incentives(paragraph 1. 22).iv. Effect of standards and specifications on export potential of products purchased by the public sector (paragraph 10. 3).v. Civil Service/industry mobility (paragraph 12. 5).vi. Burdens on industry (paragraph 12. 6).CONCLUSION11.        We recognise that NEDC may find this only a modest contribution,even as a first step.    But we must not underestimate the importance ofshowing that we meant exactly what we said about industrial priorities in the1975 White Paper.    The fact is that there is no single, simple remedy forour problems within the field of industrial policy.    We need to make and goon making a whole series of undramatic but, over the longer term,important adjustments to our policies with a view to giving United kingdom industry the same degree of support as its competitors get from their ownGovernments.     The proposals in the officials&apos; report are a firstcontribution to this with suggestions about how it can be carried forward.If we are to keep the support of both sides of industry in the development ofthe industrial strategy we must be able to convince them that all parts ofGovernment are fully committed to it,D W HE G VTreasury Chambers19 July 19776

For the immediate^ture this will mean giving priority to industrial development over consumptionANNEXDraft NEDC paper the WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE INDUSTRIAL STRATEGYHgrcorandiam by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for IndustryIntroductionThe relative decline in the performance of British manufacturing industry inthe post-war period has been associated with a climate of opinion in the UK   whichhas been at best indifferent and at worst hostile to the role of industry ineociety.   There has been a widespread failure to recognise the key wealth-generatingfaction of industry.   This tendency is deeply rooted in our history, social5tructure and culture.   Against this background, Governments more often than nothave given priority to social objectives over industrial objectives, with theresult - though unintentional - that industry has found it more difficult to function effectively and competitively.   This tendency has meant that the men and&quot;omen who work in our manufacturing industry - at all levels - have not beenSiven adequate recognition of their importance by society, and that much of thebest of our national talent has been directed towards non-industrial employmentsuch as education, the public service, the City and the professions.   although^h^other th&amp;jfc manufacturing,     . such as parts of the service sector, createWealth and contribute to our trading performance, it is our manufacturinglndustry, despite its concentration of capital, skills and traditional dominance,vhich has lagged most conspicuously behind our major industrial competitors.
CONFIDENTIALor even our social objectives.   There is no other way of developing theindustrial base on which the Government&apos;6 whole programme of economic andsociial reform depends&quot;.3.    The attached paper is a first survey of the broad areas of government policy (other than those directly covered by the work of the Sector working parties) which bear in one way or another on industrial performance and efficiency.   The various policies have been grouped to reflect an industrialviewpoint* rather than to reflect Departmental categorisation.   It alsodescribes certain action already taken or now proposed to give a higher priority to the needs of industry, and makes proposals, subject to the views ofthe Council, on how this problem should be tackled in the longer term. It willbe no easy matter to change the deeply rooted attitudes, and the accumulatedpolicies, which have contributed to industrial decline, and the change will takemany years:   but tiie Government is determined to continue with this work.   the objective is to ensure that Government policies as a whole give British industry at least the same degree of support, and as favourable an environment, as is givento their own industries by competitor countries.Future Actionit.     The Government proposes, subject to the views of the Council, to carry outfurther reviews of areas of policy posing long-term problems for industrial efficiency.   The long-term problems which should next be the subject of furtherconsideration, as proposed in the attached paper, are:(i)   employment of graduates by industry (paragraph 1.9);(ii)   public sector manpower policy (paragraph 1.15);(iii)   social security and tax in relation to work incentives (paragraph 1.22)*(iv)   effect of standards and specifications on export potential of productspurchased by the public sector (paragraph 10.3);(v)   civil service/industry mobility (paragraph 12.5);(vi)   burdens on industry (paragraph 12.6).5*     In addition it proposes that:(i) Ministers from the non-industrial Departments should attendNEDC from time to time to discuss their contribution to theindustrial strategy.   A start was made last month when the

LABOUR1&apos;      The Supply of Labour to  industry*1    It is essential that a fair share of the nation&apos;s most ableManpower - at all levels -  is employed in manufacturing industry,and that their education,   training and motivation are  such thattheir ability can be fully utilised in industry.    There  is good reason to believe  that this is not happening,  and has not happenedfor a long time  in the UK.    A decisive  shift of some of our mostable manpower  into manufacturing must be  looked for if the regener-ation of industry is  to be achieved and  sustained.1*2    Schools Education.    The  influence of the education system onthe economic performance of the  country has been an importanttheme  in   the  current  public  debate  on  school  education,   in whichrepresentatives from both sides of industry have played a full part.  /The Secretary of State for Education and Science has justPublished a consultative  document  &quot;Education in Schools&quot;,   setting0ut conclusions and proposals for further action.    Among the pointsln this document/which are particularly relevant  to  the  industrialstrategy are the following:i. although there  is some public  criticism of the  schoolsthere  is no  clear evidence of a general decline  in standards.In some  schools the  curriculum may have become overloaded tothe detriment of essential  skills,   including literacy andnumeracy.    No other aims  should divert attention from theseessential elements of the curriculum;education area willii. the balance and breadth of the  school curriculum in each locabe reviewed by local education authorities and their teachers,and industry and commerce   will      be involved in this process;to do more toiii. schools need/ prepare pupils for the  transition to  adultand working life,   in particular by equipping them with abasic understanding of the functioning of the  economy and activities,   especially manufacturing  industry,  which create the nation&apos;s wealth;iv. attention   will      be   given to the development of methodsof monitoring the performance of the  school  system,   especiallyin English,  mathematics and science;
v. various steps will be taken to improve the quality of the teaching forceeg by requiring applicants to teacher training to have minimum qualificationsin mathematics and English, and by developing in-service and induction training-(In this connection the Secretary of State recently announced a special pro-gramme to train serving teachers or unemployed qualified teachers in subjectsimportant to the industrial strategy);vi. encouragement will be given to the recruitment to teacher training of people who have had experience outside education;vii. attention must be given in initial teacher training to acquaintingteachers with the national importance of industry and commerce and to helpingthem to convey this to their pupils;viii. local education authorities will in general need to develop moresystematic approaches to the recruitment, career development, training anddevelopment of teachers, including procedures for assessment advice, and where necessary, early retirement;ix. communications between employers, trade unions and the school need tobe improved especially at the local level.   Joint efforts should relate tosuch matters as improving understanding of the importance to our national life of productive industry and trade; the provision of work experience as partof a school course; increased opportunities for people in industry to visitschools, and teachers and pupils to visit factories; and the appointment ofmanagers and trade unionists from industry as governors of schools;x. local education authorities, schools and industry should considertogether how careers guidance   can   best be developed to ensure that young people get correct and up-to-date information about jobs and trainingopportunities in local industry. . Many schools will need to adjust theirpriorities to make room in the curriculum for careers education for all pupilsnot later than the age of 13.1.3   Higher and Further Education.   As far as higher education is concerned, theevidence suggests that the intake by manufacturing industry of graduates falls shortin both quality and quantity.   ^The recently published consultation document&quot;Industry, Education and Management&quot;, reviews in detail some of the evidence forreaching such a conslusion^.   Many SWPs have also drawn attention to shortages insupply of skilled manpower, particularly qualified engineers and scientists.
1*4    While there has been a substantial increase in the output of graduatesentering employment over thepast 25 years, the proportion entering employment inthe manufacturing sector has decreased from, a 196lnpeak of 4.1% to 25.9^ in 1975*The actual number of graduates&apos; recruited by industry has increased over the samePeriod from 4611 to 6098, but in recent years has varied widely from year to yearreflecting such factors as the fluctuations in the economic cycle and the fall inemployment in the manufacturing sector: the general level of recrutiment in the1970&apos;s has been lower than in the peak years of the late 1960&apos;s, .(o238&apos;in 1969).figures.do not,  however,  reveal the final destination of the verylarge number of graduates who  do not directly enter employment.The table below summarises an attempt  to  identify the   sectorsentered by all of those  1971 graduates known to have enteredemployment  in the United Kingdom whether after obtaining theirlrst qualification or later.     It  still relates to only about two-thirds of aXX  1971 university graduates:Percentage entering:Public Service 17Education 40Manufacturing Industry 18Other Industry 8Commerce 10Other 61001 ^The  evidence  covering the  supply to industry of highly qualified^&quot;power is,  however,   complex and difficult to interpret.     It must6 noted,  for example,   that the  stock of graduates in industry hasSe*i markedly and that graduates are  spreading into occupationaleVels not traditionally associated with them.    Supply considerations&amp;1?e  Likely to be prominent among the matters covered in a  specialfQrt commissioned by the British Association for the advancement of o   .science with Government support,  which will be published thisJtnmer.    The  Government for its part is making a detailed factualUcTyr making use of all available data including the experienceUniversity Appointments Boards.Of1.6St-It is,  however,   generally agreed that the  quality of thereCrUitGd by i*dusrry should be improved;  manufacturingtry in particular has not been attracting its proper share of
confidential the most able young people in the country.   Engineering graduates,of whom the large majority take jobs in industry, have tended in thepast to have on average   poorer A level qualifications than those inmost other subjects.   While industry gets its full share of the moreable amongst these graduates, a variety of factors including socialattitudes and the fluctuating patterns of recruitment by industry have contributed to keeping the overall quality lower than it should be.There is, however, evidence that the trend is beginning to change.    Anapparent shift in attitude has led to both a marked upturn in thenumber of applications for courses in engineering and science in higher education, and an increased willingness on the part of graduates to seek employment in industry.    There is also evidencethat industrial recruitment now is steadier and more buoyant, whilethat of the public sector has abated.    The institutions of higher education for their part have at present some spare capacity onthe science and engineering side, and though this may be fairly quicklytaken up, the opportunity exists for developing more courses witha clear industrial slant.1.7   The long-term objectives for ensuring an adequate supply and use of highly-qualified manpower in industry must therefore be:i. to increase the quantity and quality of the graduateoutput seeking industrial employment;ii. for industry - particularly small and medium-sized firms -to alter its recruiting patterns to absorb more of the outputof higher and further education;iii. to increase the account taken of industrial needs in the planning of degree courses in universities and polytechnics;iv. to increase the knowledge and understanding of industryamongst teachers in higher education.1.8   The following first steps towards these long-term objectives hasbeen taken:i.       the DES has announced two financial incentives intendedto attract able students into courses of particular value to industry:a     a scheme (still to be worked out in detail) ofindustrial scholarships to be run in collaboration with industry.    The full support of industry will berequired if this scheme is to be successful, and theGovernment hopes that progress can be made as fast as possible;
b        a modification of the awards arrangements to  enableemployers to give  students financial  support up to 500  (in addition to present disregard of  185)  withoutreduction of grant;ii. in the post-graduate  sphere priority is being given tothe development of courses designed and run in close association with industry;iii. the University Grants Committee  (UGC)  has inviteduniversities to make proposals for a number of first degreecourses  of very high quality,   perhaps lasting  k years,  witha pronounced orientation towards manufacturing industry,   anddesigned for students likely to become leaders in theirprofession and to move  into senior levels of management;iv. the UGC  and the Council for National Academic Awards arealso  considering what kind of degree  courses  can best meetthe needs of the growing number of students who will find their way into a broad range of jobs in industry not traditionallyfilled by graduates.1*9    These  are,  however,  only the first  steps,  and far-reachingaanges in attitudes and practices may be required before thelong-term objectives will be reached.    The Government will give further consideration to these problems in the light of thetatistical survey mentioned/above,  and the British AssociatiorisReport. The enquiry under Sir Montague Finniston into the engineering profession&apos;ftlch was announced on k July will also be relevant.&apos;10 Public Sector Manpower Policy.    Many SWPs have expressed concern**hat the public  sector is absorbing too great a share of able man-Power,  particularly the well-qualified.    So far,   the Governments not  sought to adjust the  intake of qualified manpower to  thePublic  sector on the grounds of its impact on the  supply availableto industry.1 11&quot;Al As far as graduates are  concerned,   the proportion directlycering employment who entered the public  services  (excluding6cJUcation)  rose from lk.8% in 1965 to 26.2% in  1975 but fellack to 21.1% in 1976.    The recent decrease in the intake ofaduates by the public  sector caused by public expenditure0nstraints has been associated with  (although not necessarily the0Te cause of)  an increased number of graduates  seeking industrial employment.
1.12 Statistics relating to other qualified people enteringpublic  services are not available,  but estimates based on the  1971Census of Population suggest that whereas ^7 per cent of those with degree and equivalent qualifications are employed in thepublic  sector  (ie public  services plus nationalised industries)60 per cent of those with qualifications not of degree level butusually obtained after the age of l8  (a high proportion of whichare in teaching and nursing but also include HNC  and HND)  were employed in that  sector,   as were  28 per cent of those with GCEA level or equivalent qualification but no higher qualifications-For  comparison,   slightly over a quarter of the  total populationwere employed in the public  sector in 1971-    The  skills exercisedat the technician and craft levels are much more  specific andjob-related  than those  possessed by newly-qualified graduates.The public and private  sectors are,   generally speaking,   in competition for those people only at a point when they leave  schooland before they are trained.1.13 SWPs have in particular argued that,   in many cases,  manufacturindustry is unable to compete with the pay and conditions offered by the public  sector.     If this were widely the case,   there wouldbe a formidable  combination of market and cultural forces whichwould lead to the public  sector pre-empting qualified manpower indisproportionate quality and quantity.1.lk This  is,  however,   an area where facts are difficult toestablish,  where  care must be taken to examine  comparable jobs,and where generalisations are unlikely to be valid.    It is also necessary to take account of the relativities between manufacturing industry and other parts of the private  sector.1.15 The Government believes that there  is reason to be  concerned at the possibility of pre-emption by the public  sector of resourcesof able manpower at the  expense of industry.     It  considers     that much more account must now be taken in public  sector manpowerpolicies of their implications for the  supply of labour to industry,  and of relativities between the public  sector andindustry where they are  competing for the  same  type of manpower-It proposes to conduct a more  searching examination of the factsabout public  sector recruitment of qualified manpower  (includingpay relativities and other factors).
1.16    Incentives to Work.     It  is  important  from an  industrialviewpoint  that  the  taxation  system does not  distort  the  labour market to the extent that the normal wage  structure  fails toprovide  an adequate  incentive  to  work and to  gain skills andpromotion.    Yet there  is widespread feeling - at all levels -that the present taxation system has weakened the incentive towork throughout the  economy.1*17    As far as the lower end of the labour market is  concerned,a problem which has received much attention recently is that ofthe relationship between  social  security and welfare  benefits  for those  out  of work and earnings in work.     This problem is  limited in  size,   and  its  effects have been exaggerated.     But   situationsdo  exist  in which the net  income of those unemployed or absent  throughsickness  can,   at  least  for a period,   exceed their net  earningswhile  in work,   and  that  for others,   the  net additional reward  fromWorking is very  small.     This problem is  caused not only by thelevel  of benefits,   but alse by features  of the  tax  system  (lowthreshholds,   and refunds  of tax  for  those  out of work).     As wellas the disincentive  effect on those not  in work,   the perceptionof this problem can be  demoralising for those  in work.1.18    A  closely related,  but  separate,   problem is  that of the&quot;poverty trap&quot; which affects  those  in work,   and which flows  fromthe  combination of current  taxation levels and means-testedbenefits.     This  does not  in practice  mean,   as  is widely supposed,&quot;that those  affected derive  no net benefit from normal pay increases,because  the  income  limits  for means  tested benefits are regularlyuprated and thus move up as pay moves up.     But it  does mean thathere  is a wide band of low earnings over which net  income increaseslittle if at all.    For example,  for a married man with 2 young children claiming all the available benefits,   total net incomedoes not increase at all between gross earnings of  30 and  ^5a week,  and increases by less than  5 between  45 and  60.    Thereis therefore little  incentive in this income range  for a workerto increase his earnings -  for example through working overtime,Qr through gaining skills or promotion,   or through a  change  of job.in post-tax pay&apos; 19    There has been a long-term tendency for differentials/betweenbilled and less  skilled work to be  compressed.    As far asManagerial pay is concerned,   several  surveys have  shown thatManagerial pay,   in the UK,   is in general  substantially lower thanin other major industrial  countries;   though a large part of this
simply reflects the overall difference in GDP per head, it has undoubtedly made overseas employment and emigration increasinglyattractive to the more mobile and talented managers.   The DOI&apos;scontacts with both US and UK multinationqU confirm that they are havingincreasing difficulty in persuading UK nationals to return to the UKafter service abroad because of the weight of direct taxation and lowersalaries common here.1.20     International comparisons of income taxation are never straight-forward, partly because of the difficulty of establishing an acceptablebasis of currency translation and partly because of the variation inthe distribution of earnings.   The relative importance of social security contributions, the tax treatment of the family unit and other allowances will also vary widely.    It is fairly clear, however, thatUK marginal and effective rates of tax are high by internationalstandards, particularly for earnings substantially below and above theaverage.    For example, in the UK a married man with two children,earning half the average production worker&apos;s wage, will be paying taxalthough his counterparts in France, West Germany, the Netherlands,the USA and Japan pay no tax.    Similarly, in the UK a family man onfive times average earnings surrenders nearly 50% of his income intax (assuming the complete package of reliefs proposed in the Budget),at a marginal rate of 75%* while the equivalent taxpayer in Francepays only 16% and in Germany, the USA and Japan about 35% (includinglocal income tax where appropriate).    At this level of earnings theNetherlands is closest to the UK with about the same average rate buta slightly lower marginal rate.    Only in Sweden are marginal andaverage rates higher than in the UK.1.21       The long-term objective must be to restore a situation inwhich - at all levels - the labour market can operate effectivelyand provide adequate incentives to work, while continuing to giveprotection to the poorer members of society.   The inter-relation of social security benefits and tax is, however, an area of greatcomplexity, where generalisations can be facile and where solutionsmay be difficult to find.1.22      The Chancellor of the Exchequer has given a commitment, as faras circumstances permit, to reduce the burden of income tax at all leveland to increase the level of personal tax allowances to the point wherethey stand above the levels of the main social security benefits, and a start was made in the last Budget.    Moreover, the Government intends togive further consideration to the question how far the interaction of tax and social security system creates disincentives to work at lowerCONFIDENTIAL    4&quot; levels of earnings.
2.1    The  Government remains  committed  to  its  efforts  to  ensure  throuregional policy that  jobs  can go to workers  in areas of high unemployment.     But even in an economy with no regional  imbalances,it would remain necessary to  ensure  that workers with particularskills  can eaBily move  to the particular vacant  jobs requiring thoseskills.    Even with the present high levels of unemployment,  manycases are being reported by SWPs of shortages of key  skilled workers the machinery exists in the Employment Service Agency forcirculating particulars of vacancies and of available labourthroughout  the  country and this machinery is  at present beingmodernised using the latest computerised techniques.2.2    Housing and Industrial Mobility.     Housing policy can greatlyassist industrial regeneration by making it easier for people tomove house to new jobs.    This was recognised in the recent green paper on housing policy.    Many of its proposals \ill help;   inparticular,  wider access to home ownership;  more flexible allocationand transfer policies in the  local authority sector  (especially the ending of residential qualifications for access to waiting lists);further support for the growth of housing associations and new formsof tenure;   and measures  to  sustain the   supply of   &apos;quick access&apos;accommodation in the private rented  sector.    Local authorities will be  encouraged to  think comprehensively about the needs of labourmobility in preparing  the new local housing  strategies  each year;and central Government will be able  to take their proposals intoaccount  in allocating capital resources.     A pilot  scheme  is being set up to link local authority housing with vacancies for keyworkers  so  that these  can be advertised by the ESA in other areas with an offer of local authority accommodation;   and the RoyalCommission on Legal Services  is  examining the  cost  of  conveyancingof owner-occupied houses.2-3    Transferability of Pensions.    While  there are no  statutoryobstacles to voluntary transfer of pension rights,   there are certainPractical difficulties which may,   in some  cases,   impede  occupationallabour mobility.    The  Secretary of State  for Social  Services  intends to invite  the Occupational Pensions board to  study the question oftransf erability as  soon as practicable.
3.1 Recent years have seen a large amount of employment legislati011&apos;such as:Equal Pay Act,   1970;Industrial Relations Act,1971;Contracts of Employment Act,   1972;Employment and Training Act,   1973;Health and Safety at Work Act,   197MTrade Union and Labour Relations Act,   197^  and   1976;Sex Discrimination Act,   1975;Employment Protection Act,   1975&apos;Proposals for occupational pensions and industrial democracylegislation are  also under  consideration.3.2    The Government  is  convinced that  its major reforms  are bothnecessary and desirable.     If employees - and unions -  feel moresecure,  they are more likely to  co-operate to increase productiviand  efficiency.     However,   given the  volume  of these  measures,   aperiod of adjustment is required by both management and trade uni0and the Government will take  full account of this  in considering any proposals for further legislation in this field.    The Departmel1of Employment has also arranged for two pieces of research to becarried out  on the  impact of recent measures on employers,   inparticular to establish whether there  is validity in the viewthat  these measures have made  employers more reluctant to take on new labour.CAPITALk.

s4.2    The Government is,  however,   concerned that the banks  should show a proper understanding of the needs and importance ofindustry,   just as  (as is discussed elsewhere in this paper)  it isconcerned that the civil  service and education should show a properunderstanding of industry.    The Government therefore wishes to seean increasing involvement of the banks in the industrial  strategy and welcomes the addition of bank representatives as members of SWP5.      Taxation5.1    Detailed questions on taxation  (such as  the  future  of the  stockrelief scheme)  are not appropriate  to a discussion of the widerimplications of the industrial strategy.    However,   it is appropriatehere  to  emphasise  that  the  Government1s  long-term taxation objectivesinclude:i. maintaining  stability and  continuity of the  corporatetax system,   to  strengthen business planning and  confidence;ii. reducing the burden of direct personal taxation at all levels,  and achieving a better balance between direct and indirect taxation;iii. reducing the  complexity of the  tax system  (which atpresent places a heavy administrative burden on industry andMoon Government),reover,   the Government considers  itan important objective  tocreate an environment which promotes innovation  (eg by measures toassist  small firms).    These objectives constitute an appropriatefiscal background to the industrial strategy.PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTIOND&apos;      Infrastructure6.1    Planning and Land.    A number of SWPs have drawn attention toth-e danger that planning procedures may obstruct the industrialstrategy,  either because too little priority is placed on the needfQr industrial development or because of the  slowness and complex-itY of planning procedures    (which,   it has been alleged,   delay industrial-ial development much more than is the  case in other countries).The Government has taken the following steps:CONFIDENTIAL-i -i
i. as described in the paper put  to the Council lastmonth by the Secretary of State  for the Environment,   ithas asked local authorities now to  give  industry toppriority in the handling of planning applications and inmaking land available for development and to be particularlysensitive to the needs of small firms in both urban and rural areas;ii. as far as the Department of the Environment itself is concerned,  matters relating to industrial  development,   including appeals and building regulations jurisdiction,  will nowbe given first priority.    While average times for the handling of planning appeals by the Department have almost halved inthe  last two years,  the  Government is determined to achievean even greater improvement.     The Department  therefore proposesfor the  future  to  give priority to  the handling of allindustrial planning appeals.     It also aims to transfer toinspectors all industrial planning appeals relating to building-up to  1500  sq metres,   as opposed to the existing upper limit of 500  sq metres.    With  these  changes,   the  Departmentconsiders that it could work to a period of 5 months as thenormal maximum for the handling of most  industrial planningappeals,   with not more  than about one  case  in five  exceedingthat  figure.    That  proportion cannot be  eliminated becausethe handling of a planning appeal  depends on co-operation bythe  local authorities and the applicant,  and also on the amountof local  opposition that may be  generated.     Highly contentiousor large applications for industrial planning permission are often called in by the Secretary of State as the most satisfactory way of handling them.    The times for such cases are not included in the references above and they would normally exceed five months.    Special  considerations applyalso  to mineral extraction cases.    Steps are being takenwithin DOE to  speed up the handling of such cases but many ofthem are  complex and will continue  to present difficulties?iii.  the Secretary of State for Scotland has published aconsultation paper on the  general operation of the planningsystem in Scotland:   this includes possible means of speedingup the handling of planning applications.    He also proposesdiscussions with the local authorities,  STUC  and CBI on theindustrial  strategy which will include,   among other things,
CUiMFlDEN TlALconsideration of the ways in which the planning systemmight assist industry;iv.     similar steps   to those  of DOE are being taken by theSecretary of State for Wales.6.2    The Government is considering whether research can beundertaken  to monitor the  effects of the  above measures.6.3     Industrial Development Certificates   (IDC 1s)   and office development Permits   (ODP&apos;s).     While  the  Government  is  committed to retaining these instruments as an essential part of regional policy,   it made relaxations  in the IDC  scheme  in 1976,  and hasnow announced relaxations in the ODP scheme  (which also impingeson manufacturing industry).     It undertakes to  operate both  schemes in as flexible as possible  a manner  in the  interests  of theindustrial strategy.6.4    Building Regulations.     Industry also has a  close  interest  inthe  speedy handling of applications for building regulationsapproval.     Work is at present being undertaken:i. to develop a more flexible and time-saving procedure for building regulation;ii. to examine  the  scope for rationalisation of the buildingregulations and other legislation relating to buildings,particularly in respect  of measures  against fire.6.5    Roads.     One  of the principal objectives for future transport policy  set  out  in the  Government 1s White  Paper   (Cmnd  6836)   is  tocontribute  to  economic  growth and higher national prosperity by giving industry and other  sectors of production an efficienttransport  service.    To this end the Government will give priority within the national road programme  to  improvements onroutes which serve the main industrial areas and the ports.Industrial traffic will also benefit from the road schemes chosen to  serve regional needs and those designed to take heavy trafficout of built up areas.     As  far as  local Government  is  concerned,authorities have been asked by the Government to reflect  the priority for industry in their traffic management policies and intheir choice of road schemes.
6.6    Public Transport.    Adequate public transport  services are essential  if the  labour force  is to be  properly matched withavailable  employment,  and if shift working is to be feasible.    Inits White Paper on Transport Policy,   the Government re-affirmsits belief that the maintenance of an effective network of bus services is an important aim of its transport policy and makes provision for a substantial and continuing commitment to financial support.    The White Paper rejects any notion of imposing majorcuts  in the railway system,  and  sets out the main tasks for therailways,   of which the  carriage  of people to and from work inLondon and  the major  conurbations,   and the  carriage  of bulkfreight especially between  sidings,  are particularly material to this paper.7.      Production and Distribution Costs7.1    Pollution Policy.     The UK1s  geography and  climate  gives itan environment which can more  easily absorb and disperse pollutionthan the  environments of many continental countries.The Government thereireaffirms its determination to resist e.c. and other internationalproposals for uniform emission standards in place of the existingUK quality objectives approach, which is preferable on both econonii0and environmental grounds.7.2 As far as existing UK practices are concerned, the Governmendoes not consider that these in general are imposing an unreason3burden on industry.    However,  there may have been cases where tootabrupt  changes or   inconsistent decisions have been to the detrimenof industry.    The Government:i. has asked local authorities to  cease imposing planningconditions in an attempt to deal with problems which are  thesubject of controls under separate legislation;ii. will make greater efforts to keep export industries intouch with international moves towards higher environmentalstandards.7*3 Energy Policy. General energy policy issues have recentlybeen the subject of separate discussion in NEDC. A Green paper on Energy Policy will be published later this year.
7.4    A matter of  concern to  a number of SWPs has been that of energy pricing policy.     In general,   the Government  considers  thatthe prices  to  industry of electricity,   coal,   gas and oil  do notcompare unfavourably with price levels in other European countries,and that the  objective of proper economic pricing is in the bestlong-term interests of industry as well as  the  economy in general.7.5    It  is  sometimes argued  that,   in order to hold down prices  forthe domestic  sector,   there has in the past been a degree of cross-subsidisation   within     energy tariffs and prices against industrialconsumers.     In fact for a number of years both domestic andindustrial tariffs were well below economic levels.    The move towards proper economic pricing has,  however,  been accompanied bya better general balance between industrial and domestic prices and tariffs.    The Government welcomes this move,   and would notvish for the future to see   discrimination against industrialconsumers.7.6    The real price of energy is,  however,  bound to rise over the longer term.    The return to industry from energy conservationprojects is  therefore  equally certain to be increasingly large.Th-e Government hopes that the Council wi 11 use its influence toPerthesuade  industrialists of the benefits for them,   as well as fornation,   in undertaking investment  in energy conservation.7 7*&apos; Transport Costs. Two e.c. issues could have important consequences0r transport  costs:i. the new proposals  for harmonization of maximum permittedlorry weights and dimensions  (which,   if agreed,  would reducethe  costs of road freight);ii. the introduction of e.c. rules on commercial drivers&apos; hours(the increase in costs will be severe unless we can achieve thestaged programme of implementation for which we are negotiating).6 Government will attach particular importance to the  industrial^Plications in its approach to these two issues.? oThe Government&apos;s intention to increase taxation on heavy lorriesl*i line with the principle of covering full economic  costs,ever,   it will continue to give full consideration to the views
of industry in deciding on the  pace  of increase  in thistaxation.7.9    Water Charges.    Water authorities are under a  stautory obligation to  set charges high enough to break even.    They arealso required to fix charges with regard to  costs,   and to avoidundue  discrimination between different  classes of consumers.This effectively precludes them from discriminating in favour ofindustry:   nor is it reasonable that they should,   since  theycould only do  so at the  expense of the  domestic  consumers for whom water  services charges are already a  sensitive  issue  in the context of counter-inflation policy.     Some  industries havecomplained of particular  difficulties  arising from increases  in trade  effluent  charges,   especially where  charges had been keptartificially low in the past and are now being increased as aresult of the general move  towards equalisation within regionsindustries(agreed in principle with the CBI).   These/ are  consideringjointly with the water industry ways and means of solving these problems.8 .       Research and Development8.1    A number of recent policy initiatives have borne out theGovernment 1s determination to encourage R&amp;D in industry.    Selectiveassistance under Section 8  of the  Industry Act   1972,   has  includedprovision for product  development  assistance,   and /this  is beingextended under the Process and Product Development Scheme whichhas recently been announced/.    On a smaller scale,   the ManufacturinAdvisory Service announced in April,   to which  8 million has been allocated over 5 years,  will help smaller and medium sized firms in manufacturing industry,   especially those engaged in metalworking and assembly,   to make better use of proven technologies.8.2    Through such schemes the Government aims to assist industryto  carry through its own research and development.    The management of the Governmenfs own research and development  also has animportant role  to play.     In the research council  sphere  special efforts are being devoted to  the development of research in areaslikely to be  of special value to  industry.     For example,   in science the resources devoted to  &quot;big science&quot;   (high energy physics,astronomy and space  science)  are being cut back by 25% to preservescope for initiative in other fields  (eg polymer engineering,marine technology and mineral  exploration).CONFIDENTIAL
8-3    The   eight   Requirements Boards which commission research workon behalf of the Department of Industry aim to  increase  the numberof contracts placed  in industry or  industry supported research associations,  rather than &quot;in-house&quot;.     In aggregate  the BoardsPlan to  commission from  industry k1% of the work over  the nexttew years.    This  can be  compared  to  the  following proportions over&quot;the last  4 years:1973-74 1974-75 1975-76 1976-7712.7% 12.9% 17.2% 21.9%Some work will of course continue to be done by the department&apos;sown Industrial Research Establishments. However, the Governmentrecognizes the importance of getting the fruits of this work out into industry for industry to develop as early as possible.8.^1    Moreover,  all Government departments which sponsor technicaldevelopments have been asked to review arrangements to ensure thatas much as possible of the work is done  in industry rather than&quot;in-house&quot;.8.5    The Advisory Council on Applied Research and Development   (ACARD)has now been established under the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s chairmanship.Its work programme is  specifically directed towards the  industry-delated aspects of R&amp;D.     It will,   inter alia,  be  considering theGovernments role  as a  commissioner of R&amp;D and how full  industrialbenefits can be gained from this.SCALES9 *      Marketing9*1    Metrication.    The Government has now put forward a metricationProgramme as a basis for consultation,  and recognizes the  industrialimportance of the implementation of metrication being completed as^Pidly as possible.9*2    Standardization.    The Government is urgently following up the^commendations addressed to  it in the Warner Report,  which will^e the  subject of a separate report to the Council.
9.3    Consumer Protection.    In general consumer protection measuresoperate at  the point of sale and thus have no direct  effect  onmanufacturing industry.    Proposals on product liability,  under whichproducers would be automatically liable for damage  caused by their products,  may have implications for insurance  cover needed bymanufacturers in certain sectors  (notably pharmaceuticals,  machine tools,  motor cars),  but at present there is insufficient evidence toquantify/       the&apos; effect in relation to other costs.-10      Public Purchasing10.1 The  scope for further increases in the proportion of publicpurchases made from UKmanufacturersis limited,  given that nearly 95%by value of current purchases are made from UKmanufacturers(excludingraw materials where  certain imports are inescapable and international-defence collaborative projects which are  designed to be  self-balancing.    However,  the Government:i. is introducing new machinery to look for ways of reducing yet further the amount of public purchases whichcome from abroad;ii. will  consider ways in which the UK content of purchases from UK suppliers can be maximised.10.2 An area in which greater progress can be looked for is thatof the  impact of standards and specifications on the exportpotential of products purchased by the public  sector.    attention has been focused on problems here by the Warner and Brown Reports 1as well as by SWT reports.    The Government is determined to make substantial progress here,  and hopes that industry will take  every opportunity to draw attention to the possibilities of coicreteaction in specific areas.IO.3 The &quot;arner Report noted a number of specific areas whoseexport potential might thus be enhanced.    By way of a pilotexercise,   the Department of Industry proposes to  examine indetail     the  supply of broadcasting equipment  .    The department will discuss with purchasers and manufacturers whether there isscope for export efforts to be improved by action along the lines recommended in the Warner Report.
ireBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT11-       Competition Policy11.1    Competition policy has an important role  to play,   as part ofthe  industrial  strategy,   in improving the performance of Britishindustry.    The Government is reviewing,   in particular,   theconsideration to be given to mergers resulting from restructuringinitiatives which are consistent with the  industrial  strategy and will be providing guidance on this  to  industry.12.       Relations with Government12.1    Civil  service/industry mobility.     It  is widely held  that  theBritish practice of offering a full life  career in the CivilService,   and of little mid-life recruitment,   leads  to a lack of mutual understanding between the  Service  and industry,   and therefo]a failure  to  give  enough weight  to industry1s interests andconcerns when policy is being formulated.     Recognising that  thereis a degree of truth in this,   the Government and the GBI alike for more thana decade have accepted interchange postings between the Civil Service andmdustry as an aim of policy. Bycontinuous  effort on both  sides  something has been achieved,   butnot on a large  scale.12.2    Between   1973  and   1975,   for  instance,   some  35  civil   servantsnave  undertaken  exchange  postings  to  industry and  commerce,   andsimilarly some 70  people  from the private  sector have  done  spellsin the Service - mainly at middle management level.    On top ofthese figures,   some  60 recruits via the direct entry Principalcompetition have joined the  Service in the  last  5 years in mid-lifeafter industrial and  commercial experience.    Despite  strong opposition from the Civil Service unions this line  of recruitment  is being maintained even in present  circumstances of manpower cuts.     Itsbenefits are  cumulative,  and nearly all of those recruited stay inthe Service,   so the total from this background continues to grow.Further industrial and commercial experience has also been importedby recruitment from outside  for posts where  specific prior experience*S necessary or highly desirable.2*3    Nevertheless,   the Government  considers that  it  is very important to  achieve a much higher degree of interchange betweenCONFIDENTIAL
the Civil Service and industry,  and to promote a much greaterdegree of mutual understanding on both sides.    Although thereare very real difficulties in    arranging exchange postings,   they represent the best  short-term prospect of further improvement.The Government therefore proposes to achieve a sharp and substantial increase in the number of civil  servants  seconded to  industry.More  secondments of businessmen into the Civil Service would alsobe desirable   (although the flow of secondments need not balanceeither locally or  generally).     This  is  likely to prove moredifficult than secondments in the other direction because ablebusinessmen run greater risks than civil  servants of jeopardisingtheir careers if they leave  them for crucial periods,  and problemsof pay and conflict of interest can also arise.    These aims cannot,however,  be achieved without the active  co-operation of industry,and the Government therefore proposes to hold talks with the CBIand leading firms to seek their assistance  in achieving substantial increases in the number of secondments.12.k    There are attractions in making the  secondments rather  shorterthan the usual 2-3 years.    This can usefully increase  the number of people who have had direct experience  in commerce and industry,while also reducing the  degree of sacrifice the parent organisation has to make.    This change  can be associated with linking thesecondment to a  specific project,  which has a number of advantages-This approach has  already been tried  successfully on a  small  scale-It could well be a  significant component in the further expansionof secondments.    The use of joint  seminars  (which have alreadyproved useful)  will be  extended.    The wider use of trainingprocesses,  within the Service or in co-operation with the businessschool,  is in hand.12.5    However,   the Government  considers that the  question ofcivil  service/industry mobility requires further consideration inthe  longer term.    This may involve rethinking of issues whichgo much wider than the matter of secondments.12.6    Burdens on Industry.     It is frequently alleged byindustrialists that the  cumulative burden of Government requiremensuch as collection of information,  the  complexity of the tax system&quot;1&apos;planning delays and legislative requirements - imposes unreasonablecosts on industry,  particularly on smaller firms,  and damages
efficiency.    The Government therefore proposes,  as a first step,   to  arrange  for a fact-finding exercise  to be  carriedout to assess the total burden of Government legislative andadministrative requirements on some representative firms.
