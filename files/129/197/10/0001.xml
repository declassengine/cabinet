DRAFT STATEMENT ON COUNTER-INFLATION POLICY

FRIDAY 15TH JULY

With permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a

statement about the further measures which the Government

proposes to take in the fight against inflation and

unemployment in the light of discussions it has held with

representatives of the TUC and of the revised prospects

for the economy.      The Government continues to regard the

mastery of inflation as the pre-condition for success in

its other objectives.

2. In the last two years the nation has derived immense

advantages in this regard from the guidelines on pay

which the TUC has formulated in agreement with the

Government.      These guidelines have been fully observed

by the whole of the trade union movement and have made a

major contribution to the fight against inflation. The

Government and TUC have always recognised that the period

after July 1977 must bring an orderly return to normal

collective bargaining and that there must be no free-for-

all or pay explosion.

3. On the 22nd June the TUC General Council made a

major contribution towards these objectives by publishing

guidance on the strict maintenance of settlements made

under the current policy, with two reservations, relating

to occupational pensions and self-financing productivity

schemes.      The General Council said that negotiators

should not re-open settlements made under the current policy

after the 31st July in breach of the 12 months rule; and

should not defer settlements:due before 31st July in the

hope of securing an advantage by doing so.      This guidance

is the keystone for an orderly return to collective

bargaining.      It must be observed by all those concerned

with pay determination in both the private and public sectors.

It means that the Phase 2 policy will continue to affect the

level of the nation&apos;s earnings until the last settlement

made under it expires at the end of July, 1978.

H.      The effect is to produce a phased return to normal

collective bargaining.      For most people the next settlement

will not come until the first half of 1978.      By that time

there is a good chance that, thanks to the strict

adherence to the TUC pay policy in the past year, the rate

of inflation will be approaching, or will have reached,

single figures.      That will provide a better climate for

settlements which can be reinforced by any measures which

the Government is able to take.


Pay discussions

5. I regret to say that the Government has not succeeded

in reaching agreement with the TUC on what guidance

should be given on the level of pay settlements in the

next round when the 12 months has expired for the

bargaining group concerned.    Since the Government

has a direct responsibility for the health of the

economy as a whole and for the management of the

public sector, it has a duty to the British people to

state its position on this matter.

6. The country now faces a choice which will determine

whether by getting a sustained fall in the rate of

inflation we can profit fully from the new

opportunities opened up for us by the success of our

other policies and the flow of North Sea oil.    On the

best forecasts now available of the other factors

which may contribute to inflation, the prospect

for prices in 1978 and after will depend critically

on the rate of increase in the nation&apos;s wage bill.

To take three examples:-

(a) if the rate of increase in earnings is not more

than 10 per cent, inflation should fall below 10

per cent well before this time next year and stay

there throughout the year;

(b) if the increase in earnings is as high as 15 per

cent, we shall not get inflation down to 10 per

cent at all, and it will be rising steadily

through the second half of next year and into

1979;

(c) if the increase in earnings were as high as 20

per cent, it is probable that the   would

plummet and interest rates would soar.    So prices

  would rocket and unemployment would rocket too.

We would be back in the situation we faced just

over two years ago.


The rate of increase in earnings takes account of overtime,

job changes, and other factors which contribute to what is

called wage drift.      The House will recall that the  6 policy,

representing an average increase in wage settlements of nearly

11 per cent, produced an increase in earnings for the year of

lH per cent.      So the earnings increases of 10 per cent, 15 per

cent and 20 per cent which I have mentioned imply that the

general level of settlements should be significantly below

these figures.

7. So the choice before us is plain.      We can choose a

moderate level of pay settlements in the next twelve months and

get inflation under control again.      Or we can take the

superficially attractive course of higher money settlements now

which would actually reduce people&apos;s living standards even

faster than they have sujfered in the last 12 months. Paced

with this choice the Government has a clear duty to urge all

concerned to base their approach to pay negotiations on getting

inflation into single figures.      It must therefore choose the

first of the three alternatives and urge that the general

level of pay settlements should be moderate enough to secure

that the national earnings increase is no more than 10 per cent.

8. In a period which must mark an orderly return to normal

collective bargaining the Government cannot stipulate a

single figure at which individual negotiators should invariably

settle but it must seek to ensure that the national target is

achieved.      This means that the general level of settlements

must be well within single figures.

9. The Government therefore recommend those concerned with

pay determination in both the public and private sectors to

be guided by these considerations and to make new settlements

on the basis that they will last for 12 months.      It will

do everything possible to secure that full account is taken

of this guidance throughout the public sector.      [The CBI

have informed the Government that they will commend to member

employers in the public and private sectors both this guidance


on the level of new settlements and the Importance of

maintaining Phase 2 settlements.]

10. In settling pay in important areas of the public sector

the Government has long had valuable assistance from the

Salary Review Bodies.      Their task has been made more difficult

in recent years by the need to reconcile the national requirement

and the interests of the groups concerned.      The Government

value their help and will ask them to continue their task within

the context for pay I have described.

11. It will not be possible in the next 12 months to deal

with the whole range of pay anomalies and other problems that

have inevitably arisen during a period of strict pay

guidelines.      Only the most serious difficulties can be

tackled in the coming year, if necessary on a phased basis and

taking full account of the need to keep total settlements within

single figures.

The Remuneration, Charges and Grants Act 1975

12. The Government will make an Order adding a reference in

Section 1 of the Remuneration, Charges and Grants Act 1975 to

the limit represented by the TUC guidance on the 12 month

interval as set out at Annex A of this statement.      This will

release employers from any contractual obligations they may

have entered into to the extent that they would breach [that

guidance].      [it will also mean that the full range of

sanctions set out in Cmnd.6l51 will apply to breaches of that

guidance.]      Moreover, where a firm has reached a settlement

which is quite clearly inconsistent with the policies set out

in this statement, the Government will take this into account

in public purchasing policy and the    placing 0f contracts, and

also in the consideration of industrial assistance.


Dividends

13. An Order in Council will be introduced to extend dividend

 

controls for a further year.      The statutory limit will again

be 10 per cent.

Government measures to support its counter-inflation policy

14. The Government will of course wish to continue

discussions with the TUC over the whole field of the social&apos;

contract.      Meanwhile the Government recognises that it must

improve the climate for observing the guidance laid down by

the TUC and itself with measures which give working people

confidence that their living standards can be generally maintained

by moderate settlement at 12 month intervals.      These measures

are designed to give special help to the low paid and to families

with children.      The improvement in the economic prospect since

the Budget - in particular the improvement in the balance of

payments make it possible for me to make the following

proposals in the field of taxation, prices and employment.

Taxation

15. I propose that the reduction already agreed in petrol duty

should take effect from 6.00 p.m. on 8th August.      I do not intend

to look for offsetting tax increases elsewhere.

16. The Government also accepts the principle expressed in

certain amendments made at Committee Stage of the Finance Bill

that the income tax personal allowances should be increased

further.      However, as I explained in my Budget Statement, I

wish to concentrate    relief this year particularly on families.

By contrast, the Committee Stage amendments would tilt the

balance in favour of the single personal allowance.      I shall

therefore be proposing at Report Stage of the Finance Bill to

substitute an amendment, which will increase the allowances,

but restore the balance of my original proposal in favour of

families.      It will increase the single personal allowance by

 ^0 and the married person&apos;ls allowance by  70 as compared with

the increase in these allowances which I originally proposed in

my Budget Speech, at a cost of some f490 million;    and there


will be corresponding increases in other allowances.      At the

same time, I will propose a reduction in the basic rate of

income tax by lp from 35p to 3^p, at a cost of some  480 million.

The total costs of the income tax reliefs in this year&apos;s

Finance Bill will thus come to some  2J billion - closely in

line with my original intention in the Budget.

Child Benefit

17. The Government have also decided to increase family

support in 1978-79 by a substantial improvement in the rates

of child benefit as part of the further phasing in of the child

benefit scheme.      From April 1978 child benefit rates will be

increased from the present  1 for the first child and  1.50

for subsequent children to  2.30 for all children, together

with a doubling of the present premium for the first child

of one-parent families to  1, at a net Exchequer cost in

1978-79 of some  288 million.      The new rates will result in

part from a further step in the phasing out of child tax

allowances the basic level of which will be reduced to  100.

A fuller statement about the level of child tax allowances in

1978-79 will be made in due course.      [Regulations for the new

child benefit rates will be laid very shortly.]

Prices

18. The Government have decided to prevent certain increases

in the cost of living which would otherwise take effect before

the end of this year and which are particularly burdensome for

people on low incomes or with family commitments.      Milk is an

important item in family budgets, especially when there are

several children.      The Government has therefore decided to

increase the milk subsidy so as to prevent an immediate further

price rise of l^p a pint and keep the price of milk unchanged

until the end of the year.      The cost will be about  110 million

falling in the financial year 1977-78.


19, . The Government have also decided to raise the income

limits for eligibility for free school meals.      This will

provide over half a million more children with &apos;free school

meals and increase the total number eligible to over one quarter

of those children who take school meals.      The cost will be

 171 million in 1977~78 and  271 million in a full year and

local authorities will be consulted about how this should be

reimbursed.  &apos; &quot;  

20V  The electricity discount scheme will also be operated

again this winter, in order to relieve households receiving

Family Income Supplement or Supplementary Benefit of 25 per cent

of one quarter&apos;s bill.

Employment and the Industrial Strategy

 21-.&apos;-- The Government announced last month a programme of

training and work experience courses for young people at a

cost building up to  160 million a year;    and a Special Temporary

Employment Programme providing jobs for adults at a cost of

 68 million a year.

?S     The Government have also decided to approve up to a further

 100 million for construction in the current financial year,

so as to assist employment in the construction industry, which

is now going through a particularly difficult time.      This is

in addition to the  100 million for inner cities which I

announced in the Budget.      The Government is considering in the

course of hhe normal annual review of public expenditure whether

further help may be required for the construction industry in the

next financial year.

  23.   The Government have also reviewed the requirements for

additional expenditure in support of the industrial strategy.

As a result, a further cash sum of  70 million will be provided,

to be drawn down over the next few years for schemes in the

ferrous foundry and machine tools industries and for a new


product and process development scheme.

The total cost of all the measures T have announced is

 /J~ 37 million in the current financial year. The

resulting stimulus to demand in the economy will in itself

generate substantial additional employment.

2^7    The cost of the Public Expenditure measures will be

found from within the contingency reserve&apos; so that no change will

be required in the planned total for public expenditure in the

current year.

2^.     The individual expenditure programmes for 1978-79 will

also be affected by the decisions now announced concerning child

benefit, school meals and the industry schemes.   However for

total public expenditure the White Paper published last January

(Cmnd 6721) remains the basis for planning.    The programmes

will be reviewed in detail in the annual survey.

Cash Limits

2^.     Por 1977-78 the cash limits have already been fixed and

published in Cmnd. 6767.   No general changes are planned in

the limits.   Por 1978-79 the assumptions used will reflect the

Government&apos;s policy on pay.   Spending authorities will not be

able to rely on supplementary provision beyond the cash limits.

Public Sector Borrowing Requirement and Monetary Policy

2$.     Token by themselves, the tax measures which I have

announced this afternoon imply a net addition of  /J~ J

million to the Budget estimate for the PSBR for the current

year.   On the other hand as I have said developments in the

economy since the Spring point to a reduction in the original

forecast.   As I have explained, the additions to public expen-

diture this year will be found from within the Contingency

Reserve,.and imply no additional change in the PSBR.    I am

satisfied that the measures I have announced will not increase

the PSBR above the level of  8.5 billion I forecast in the


Budget - that is, a figure within the limit of  8.7 billion

which I announced last December at the tine of the IMF agreement.

Zj.     Equally, I am satisfied that the measures which I have

announced this morning are consistent with the limit which I

have announced for DCE and forecast range for sterling and M3.

The Government intends to maintain its DGE limit and related

control of M3.

The Government will shortly publish this statement,

together with supporting material as a White Paper.

Conclusion

^0.     Mr Speaker, in deciding on the measures which I have

announced this afternoon, the Government has taken account

of the progress achieved on the balance of payments sincei-the

Budget, of the guidance given by the TUC for a phased and

orderly return to normal collective bargaining and of the

revised prospects for the PSBR in 1977-78.

They will give substantial additional protection to

living standards for working people generally, and especially

for   families with children and those with earnings well below

the average.   Indeed for the great majority of workers they will

themselves be enough or more than enough fully to offset the

price increase of less -than 4- per cent which the Government

expects between now and the end of this year.

3$&apos;     As I have said, an orderly return to normal collective

bargaining - with settlements implying an increase in average

earnings of no more than 10 per cent - is essential to our

objective of getting inflation down to single figures and

keeping it there.    These measures will ensure that such

settlements will not lead to any fall in the living standards


of the average family through the next twelve months - in

many cases there should be a small improvement.

[Particularly among the lower paid]      I believe- that the

Government have given the necessary guidance to those concerned

with pay negotiations and that these measures will help to

create the conditions in which it could be observed. The

Government look to the trades union movement, the employers

in the public and&apos;.private sectors and to the country as a

whole for continued support in the common enterprice of

conquering inflation and ensuring a sound basis for the

future growth of output. employment and living standards.
