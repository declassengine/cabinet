LEGISLATION ON ROAD SAFETY

Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Transport

1. In 1976 nearly 6, 600 people were killed on the road.    Of these 2, 500

were travelling in cars or taxis, 2,300 were walking, and 1,000 were riding

motorcycles.    In addition 80, 000 were seriously injured.    The main cost of

road accidents is the pain, grief and social disruption they cause.    But the

economic loss is aleo high.    In 1976 the loss of production, the cost of

repairing damage to property and the cost to the health and police services

of dealing with accidents is estimated at  777 million.

2. We have a large and continuing road safety programme, which

includes systems for regulating driver licensing and for ensuring acceptable

standards of vehicle safety.    We spend  2 million a year on publicity with

the largest element devoted to pedestrian safety and focused on the Green

Cross Code.    We are about to publish a revised version of the Highway

Code.    But there is increasing pressure to tackle those areas of the

problems which need fresh legislation.

3. In our last Election Manifesto we promised to bring forward

measuies to improve road safety.    We have made only one attempt to do so.

A Bill to make the wearing of seat belts compulsory was carried over-

whelmingly on a free vote in the House of Commons in 1976 but failed to

complete all its stages by the end of the Session.    There is a widely held

view that this failure owed as much to lack of purpose on our part as to the

real strength of the opposition to it.    The absence of the Bill from the

current legislative programme has confirmed this feeling.     There is

increasing criticism of the Government&apos;s apparent indifference to road

safety legislation.    Our failure on seat belts is compounded by the absence

of legislative proposals on drink and driving, despite our commitment to

implementing the Blennerhassett report;  and growing concern about the

rising number of casualties amongst motorcycle riders.

4. A proposal for dealing with the motorcycle problem was considered

by the Home and Social Affairs Committee (HS).    On that occasion, apart

from doubts about aspects of the particular proposals (which I have since


changed), there was a strong feeling that it was wrong to impose

restrictions on motorcyclists while we failed tc tackle the larger problem

of seat belts.    However The Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future Legislation

Committee had already taken the view that a Bill including random testing

and seat belts was probably not suitable for the run-up to a General Election,

if the logic of these two positions is maintained, there is no prospect of

legislation on road safety in this Parliament, despite the appalling level of

casualties, tho pressure of informed public opinion, a clear majority in the

House of Commons, a commitment in our Manifesto and, as I understand,

strong support amongst Ministerial colleagues.    I do not believe th2t this

position makes sense.

DRINKING AND DRIVING

5. Drinking and driving kills about 1, 000 people a year, more than half

of them under ?0.    The situation is now worse than before the introduction

of the breathalyser in 1967.    Last year we announced that we had accepted

the report of the Blennerhassett Committee as a basis for legislation. Its

main proposals are:-

i. Allow police to carry out spot checks to detect drinking

and driving offences.

ii. close the technical loopholes in the procedure for screening

and arresting drivers and taking samples for analysis.

iii. Introduce breath analysis instead of blood or urine analysis.

iv. Introduce new &apos;high risk&apos; procedure for dealing with repeat

offenders and those with alcohol levels about 200mg/100ml.

6. The first of these will be represented as random testing, although

I do not believe that will be its general effect.    I have considered whether

there is an alternative way of increasing police discretion to test drivers

without removing all the present restrictions, but I am satisfied that none

is practical.    The second proposal has been generally welcomed.    As for

the third, technical problems of finding a suitable instrument for reliable

breath-testing have not yet been wholly overcome, but these proviaions could

be brought in by regulation, following the passing of the Bill.    Finally, the

proposed procedure for dealing with high risk offenders has been welcomed.

MOTORCYCLING

7. In each of the la?t two years motorcycle mileage has increased by

over 20 per cent, and casualties have risen in proportion.    A recent study

of a sample of motorcycle accidents found that nearly three-quarters of the

riders injured had not passed a motorcycle driving test, and that the risk of

being injured in the first six months of the riding career is 5 times as high as

2


it is after a year&apos;s experience, and in the first month it is 10 times as high.

At present, provisional licence holders may ride mopeds and the lower

powered motorcycles indefinitely and without serious restrictions. There

is little inducement to take the driving test, and less than 10 per cent of

riders receive any formal training.

8. Having reviewed all the options and taken account of the views

expressed in discussion at HS, I believe the two most promising measures

are:-

i. To impose a speed limit of 30 mph on riders using

provisional licences.

ii. To create a power to make regulations which would require

applicants for provisional licences to satisfy the licensing authority

that they had attended an approved training course.

The first of these measures would be applied as soon as the Act was passed

and would affect all learner riders.    I understand that the police dc not see

any particular difficulty in enforcing it.    The creation of a power to require

applicants for provisional licences to demonstrate that they had received

some training would of itself induce more riders to take training.    But I am

satisfied that provided we give sufficient notice of our intention to implement

this proposal, training facilities could be provided for the vast majority of

riders without a significant increase in public expenditure.

SEAT BELTS

9. About 30 per cent of drivers and front seat passengers wear their

seat belts.    If they all did, another 1, 000 lives and 10, 000 serious injuries

would be saved each year.    This is the single most effective action we could

take to reduce casualties on the roads.    Legislation would create the power

to introduce compulsion and would set out the grounds on which exemptions

would be allowed, leaving the Government free to decide the timing of

regulations bringing it into effect.

10. A Bill on seat belts is ready for immediate introduction (last year&apos;s

Bill, with amendments arising from the Committee stage).    In the case of

drinking and driving and of motorcycling, detailed proposals would have to

be considered by HS but could be put forward without delay.    I see no

problem in having a Road Safety Bill to deal with all these matters ready

for introduction early in the next Session, following a reference to this

intention in The Queen&apos;s Speech.


RESOURCES

11. None of these proposals has significant implications for public

expenditure.    The measure to require provisional licence holders to submit

a training certificate would eventually have some manpower implications, it

it has to be implemented.

RECOMMENDATIONS

12. These three proposals, although they have the same purpose of

saving human life, may provoke different reactions.    In terms of results,

seat belts is the most important but arouses freedom-of-the-individual

arguments.    This is not the case with drink-and-driving where the victim

is often not the driver but a wholly innocent pedestrian.    As for motor-

cyclists, legislation might be thought simply to introduce measures of

ordinary prudence which are taken for granted in other areas.    I appreciate

the problem of priorities for the legislative programme, especially in the

run-up to a General Election.    I nevertheless believe that the balance of

advantage lies strongly in proceeding with comprehensive legislation as

soon as possible.    Accordingly, I invite the Cabinet to approve such

legislation in principle with a view to proceeding in the next Session.
