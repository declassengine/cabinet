MAINTAINING THE ATTACK ON INFLATION

1. The Government is determined to create a fairer and more prosperous

Britain.    We can only succeed in this objective if we defeat inflation.

We do not pursue the defeat of inflation as an end in itself.    It is

the necessary pre-condition to success in all our other policies and

endeavours.    It is essential if we are to secure the stable

foundations for the future economic prosperity and social cohesion

of this country.

2. In the last 2 years, Government, trade unions, employers and al3

ether sections of our people together have brought this covin try

back from the&apos;brink of runaway inflation which followed the oil crisis

of 1973.   The annual rate of inflation has been reduced by-10% from

its 1975 peak.   From a situation where Britons were spending far.more

than they were earning, living standards have been restrained into

line with what can be afforded.    This achievement owes much to the

remarkable self-discipline and public spirit of the British trade union

movement which has earned the admiration of the entire democratic worlo

3. Between the first half of 1976 and the first half of 1977

real t3ke borne pay fell by This W3s the delayed but unavoidable

adjustment to the 5% fall in cur real national income imposed by

the oil and other commodity price increases of 1973 

Millions  of working people and. their families shared in this

sacrifice.   The Government acted to help the most vulnerable in ov-r

society during this harsh period;    the living standards of the very

poorest, the old, the sick and the unemployed were deliberately

maintained, and those-: at work contributed to this.   The way in which

these burdens have been accepted is a great tribute tc the restraint,

the maturity and commonsease of the British people. .

*&apos;&apos;     Our success in countering inflation so far has greatly improved

our economic prospects.   Combined with the other measures taken .

fcy the Government, international confidence has been restored.

      e exchange rate has been stabilised.    Britain&apos;s foreign exchange

I   reserves   have risen dramatically.   Interest rates have declined

rapidly this year.    Our balance of payments has improved, not only . .

because of the growing benefits from North Sea oil, tut also because Oj

^Hireases in earnings from eyoorts other than oil.


5.    In the past year, however, there have been setbacks in our attempts

further to reduce the level of price increases.    The main reason has bees

the depreciation of sterling, which has added at least 4 per cent to

prices over the last 12 months.    The cuts in the public sector borrowing

requirement necessary to restore confidence&apos; and give priority to

industry, have made it necessary to reduce subsidies and raise some

indirect taxes, and have thus led to a once and for all addition to some-

prices.   Higher world food pr:ices, most strikingly tea and coffee, and

the effects of last year&apos;s drought have been additional, and in most

cases uncontrollable, developments.    The drought alone added 6 per cert;

to Britain&apos;s food prices (or 1-J per cent to the Retail Price Index).

As the table at Annex B shows, all this has meant that our inflation

rate is still fax&apos;&apos; above those of our mai-n competitors, who are

themselves making every effort to curb their more&apos;moderate rates.

6.   However, the outlook for the UK in the year ahead is much

more favourable.   The 1976 depreciation of sterling is by now almost

fully reflected in prices, and since the autumn the exchange rate has

been strong.    In recent months world commodity prices have stopped moving

against us.   We can hope to avoid again the extremely high prices of

vegetables and other fresh foods which resulted from last year&apos;s

drought.   We are getting the benefits of lower interest rates; lower

building society mortgage rates have already helped millions of people

borrowing to bo;y their own homes.

7c   The period of falling living standards now lies behind us, and a

time of great opportunity faces this nation.   We can achieve a period

of sustained higher economic growth.   This will offer benefits to our

people:    higher living standards, end more jobs;   more prosperity for

our industries;    better public services.    To this Government such

growth would provide the resources necessary for its policies aimed at

creating a more just*, as well as a more prosperous society.

8    But the opportunities and benefits which could be open   to us all,

could equally be thrown away.   The main threat is a resurgence of higher

inflation, eroding the competitiveness of our industries, creating

unemployment, hurting the most vulnerable section of our community, and

even threatening the political system and social fabric of this country-


9. Excessive pay settlements are not of course the sole cause of

inflation, as our experience in 1976-77 demonstrated.   But inflation

will follow excessively high wage settlements as surely as night

follows day*

10, The strict and standardised pay policies agreed between the

TUG and the Government for the last two years have mode a major

contribution to fighting inflation.   But there must now be scope

for reducing the rigidities and distortions which have inevitably

built up and the Government accepts, and has anticipated, that a

third year of closely structured pay policy is not practicable or

acceptable,   9?hus the problem which faces us in the year ahead is

how to secure moderate wage settlements at a time when there is a

return to orderly free collective bargaining.   That return to &apos;

collective bargaining must be managed in such a way that it cioes

not throw away the great achievements in countering inflation since

1975 and the groat prospects., for this nation in the years ahead.

It is a problem which faces us all..  Its solution will involve us all.

If we foil the price will be paid by all - though most especially by

those who are least able to bear it    Success will not only be

valuable in itself but the hey to achieving all our other objectives,-

both economic and social.

11. This White Paper sets out how the Government, after cor:sulfations

with the TUU and the OBI, sees the path to further progress in

defeating inflation in the year ahead,

THE YEAP BEGINITHTG AUGUST 1977   .  

PAY

12, The indispensable foundation for an orderly return to free

collective bargaining is the guidance issued by the TUC. This

guidance is set out at Annex A to this White Paper.   The Government

fully endorses the maintenance of settlements under the  2.50/5^/^4

&gt;     policy after July 1977 and the strict observance of the twelve

j     months interval between settlements.   If the twelve months interval

is properly observed, a largo majority of workers will not make new

|     settlements to follow the  2.50/l#/ 4 policy until 1973.   Most of.

]     these settlements could well he made at a time when the rate of


inflation has fallen to single figures, or is. very near to it.

This single figure inflation will itself &quot;be to a large extent

the product of the single figure earnings increase we are likely

to get under the  2 5Q/5%/ 4 policy.

13.    [Not used]   .   &apos; &apos; ;

IJ^Konth. Interval Between Settlements

The/guidance says that negotiators should not reopen Phase 2

settlements after 31 July in breach of the 12 months rule; and

should not defer settlements due under that policy until after

2&apos;1 July in the hope of securing an advantage by doing so. This

guidance&apos; should be adhered to by all those concerned with pay

determination in both the private and the public sectors.

.^^gyA^nts. In Occupational Pension Schemes

1.5. The TUC guidance provides for two exceptions to adherence to

the 12 months interval between settlements. One of these relates

to occupational pension schemes and provides that improvements in

these should be negotiable at any time after 31 July 1977. The

Government endorse this removal of limitations on improvements in

occupational pension schemes which have applied since the  8 policy

was introduced in July 1975. .

|     i^Ciduc&apos;&apos;.ivity .Agreements&apos;             ,            * &apos;   

16.   The other exception to the 12 months interval between

settlements relates to productivity schemes.   However, such schemes

must be fully self-financing and in particular must not add to costs

so as to raise prices. .   The Government

is in agreement with this exception also, including the strict

requirement that schemes should be fully self-financing. Well

phased and genuine productivity agreements can contribute to the

improvement in productivity end in the utilisation of existing

     investment which the country needs, but they should not be a means

of securing pay increases without genuinely raatcJiing productivity

I    Sains,   -Agreements of that kind would be unfair to consumers or to


other groups of workers, and damaging to employment and investment.

Earainp,&apos;S Increase and Inflation

17. The guidance the TUC have issued on the 12 month interval

between settlements   should go a long way towards avoiding a &apos; ;

pay explosion in the period ahead.   But the level of new settlements

will decide whether we can sei^e the real chance we now have of

securing a fall in the rate of inflation Which will endure and will

lay the foundation for a permanent and continuing rise in living

standards.   How pay agreements at a moderate level will also

buttress observance of the 12 months interval between settlements

under the TUC&apos;s guidance.

18. The Country now faces a choice.   On the best forecasts now available

oif the other fa s ers which may contribute to inflation,

the prospect for prices in 1978 and after depends critically on the

rate of increase in the nation&apos;s wage bn&apos;ll:-

(a) if the rate of increase in earnings is not more

than 10 per cent, inflation should fall below 10%

well before this time next year and stay there

throughout the year;

(b) If the increase in earnings is as high as 15%,

wo shall not get inflation down to 10% at all, and

it will be rising steadily in the second half of

next year and into 1979;

[ (o)     if the increase in earnirgs were as high&apos;as 20%,

I the S would plummet and interest rates would scare.

So prices would rochet and imeirploymenfc would rochet

too.   We would be bach, in the situation we faced just

I over two years ago.

I     1: . earnings increase by 10%, 15% or ?0% the general level of

I     settlements would have to be significantly below.

I 80 the choice .before us is plain.   We can choose a moderate

II level of pay settlements in the next twelve months, with inflation

11 coining under control again.   Or we can take the superficially


attractive course of higher money settlements now, which would

actually erode people&apos;s living standards even faster than they

have suffered in the last 12 months.   Faced with this choice,

the Government has no doubt what it should do.    It should urge

everyone to base their approach to pay negotiation on the first of

the three alternatives and accept that thegeneral level of pay

settlements should be moderate enough to secure that the national

earnings increase should be no more than 10%.

19.    If the right choice is made we can now not only maintain

living standards in the year ahead but, by securing a fall in the rate

of inflation which will endure, we can lay the foundation for a

permanent and continuing rise in living standards thereafter.

We cannot attempt to recoup the reduction in living standards of the

last 2 years which is ultimately attributable to the oil crisis

without throwing away the economic progress we have made.   We must

look ahead.   With an increase in average earnings not exceeding 10%

in t?he coming year we can expect the annual rate of inflation to

reach single figure-S during the first half of 1978.   This would of

itself ensure the maintenance of average living standards for

working   people* provided the real burden of taxation were not increased

in that period.    In fact the tax reliefs and price action described

later in this White Paper, which will take effect in the early autumn,

will give substantial additional protection to living standards,

especially to families with children and to those with earnings well

below the average.   We now expect that by the end of this year

prices will be less than 4% higher thsn they are now;,  and for the

great majority of workers the tax reliefs and price action will

fully offset - in many cases by a large margin - that 4% price

increase,

&apos; 0.   The proposals set out later in this White Paper will mean that the

lower-paid family of a married man, wife and 2 children earning  &gt;0

a week will only ne^d a     % rise in earnings to maintain its standard c

living.    The family on average earnings of around  80 a week will find

that it can maintain its real standard of living with an increase of

pr-ly    % in earnings. &apos;

^1.   All this meansit is perfectly realistic to aim at an earnings

--&apos;&apos; crease of about 10% on average since this is consistent with

Maintaining and indeed j.rp.provi np: living standards in the year ahead.


General Level of New Settlements after July 1977

22. In addition to the guidance they have issued on the 12 month

interval between settlements, the TUC have made clear the importance c

avoiding a Pay explosion in the period ahead and of achieving a

climate favourable to moderation in pay settlements.

23. The Government consider that it is their responsibility to give

some further guidance to all those concerned with pay determination,

and to working people generally, on the level of pay settlements

which is in the host interests of our economy and therefore in their

best interests also.    The Government has a dual responsibility here fo:

the health of the economy as a whole and for the management of the

public sector. &apos; &apos;

24. If we are to achieve an earnings increase in the year ended July

1978 compatible with achieving single figure inflation, the general

level of settlements will need to be well within single figures.

The Government recommend those concerned with pay determination in botl

the private and the public sector to be guided by this requirement,

New settlements should be made on the basis that they will last for

12 months.

25. A period of strict pay guidelines has meant that a number of

anomalies in pay arrangements have inevitably accumulated. In

addition, negotiators will wish in due course to consolidate existing

pay supplements.    It will not be possible to deal with the whole

range of these matters in the next 12 months, or even to make a

start with all of them.    Only the most serious difficulties can be

tacklefl in the coming year, if necessary on a phased basis&apos; and

.  , . ,l;otal

talcing full acount of the need to keep the/settlement well

within single figures.

26. With an earnings increase not exceeding 10% in the coming

year wo can expect the annual rate of inflation to reach single

figures   &lt;j u r i n g   the first half of 1978.   This would of itself

ensure the maintenance of average living standards for working people,

I provided the real burden of taxation was not increased, in that period.


In fact the tax reliefs and price action described later in this

White Paper, which will take effect in the early autumn, will give

substantial additional protection to living standards, especially

to families with children and to those with earnings well below

the average.    The Government now forecast that by the end of this

year prices will be less than 4% higher than they are now;

amd for the great majority of workers the tax reliefs and price

action will fully offset - in many cases by a large margin - that

4% price increase.

27. The guidance for pay settlements in the preceding paragraphs

is intended to apply equally in the public and private sectors.

The Government will do all it can to secure the application

of this policy throughout the public sector.    [The CBI have informed

the Government that they are prepared to commend this guidance to

memeer employers in both private and public sectors.]

28. In settling the pay of the armed forces, doctors and dentists

and top salary groups in the public sector the Government

has for many years had valuable assistance from the three Salary Review

bodies.   The task of these bodies has been made more difficult by

the general pay limits in recent years, and the need to reconcile

the national requix&apos;ement and the interests of the groups concerned.

The Government will ask the Review Bodies to continue their task

within the context set by this White Paper. ,    . ..

The Remuneration. Charges and Grants Act 1975

29. The Government will make an Order adding a reference in

Section 1 cvf the Remuneration, Charges and Grants Act 1975 to the

limit represented by the TUG guidance on the 12 month interval as

set &quot;rout at Annex A of this White Paper.   This will release employers

from ony contractual obligations they may have entered into to the

extent that they would breach [that guidance], [It will also mean that

the full range of sanctions set out in Cmnd 6151 will apply to breaches

of that guidance*] Moreover, where a firm has reached a settlement .

which is quite clearly inconsistent with theipolicies set out in this


White Paper, the Government -..&apos;ill take this into account in public

purchasing policy end the planning of contracts, and also&apos;in the

consideration of industrial assistance.

DIVIDENDS

30. An Order in Council will be introduced to extend dividend

controls for a. further year.   The statutory limit will again be

10%.

GOVEiM-ruHT MEASURES 32T SUPPORT

OF HOpKfiATE PAY Mggffl^

31. The Government recognise that, as the TUC have said, measures

vihich give working people confidence that living standards generally

can be maintained can improve the climate for pay negotiations.

These measures can also be designed to give special help to the

low peid end to families with-children.   The following paragraphs

describe measures which the Government propose to take to achieve

these objectives.     These measures will represent in total a

stimulus to the economy building up over a period to  [ ]billion.


PRICES

32. Following many months of heavy increases in prices, especially

food prices, the &quot;underlying rate of.price increase is now easing.

During the autumn we can expect to see this reflected in a fall in

the annual rate of inflation.   The Government cannot reinforce this

by freezing prices generally,least of all the prices of fresh food

or imported goods.   It can however take some steps to bring forward

part of the benefit of the lower rate of price increase,and thus to

make it easier for negotiators to conclude moderate and responsible

pay settlements in the months immediately ahead.

33. The Government have therefore decided to take action on certain

prices which are directly affected by decisions,in the public sector

and which are particularly burdensome for people on low incomes or

with family commitments.

34-.   Milk is an important item in family budgets especially where

there are several children.   The Government are therefore increasing

the milk subsidy in order to avert the need for an immediate further

price rice of 1 p a pint.   The cost will be about  100 million,

falling in the financial year 1977-78.

33.   Secondly, the Government have decided to raise the income

threshold for eligibility for free school meals when the price

gees up to 25p next term.   The effect will be to increase the

number of eligible children to over 1  million, which will be

about ore-quarter of those who take school meals.   A family with

two children will be free of payment for school meals up to

earnings of  52 a week, or about three-quarters of average earnings.

It is estimated that over half a million additional children and

about a quarter of a million extra families will benefit.   The cost

is estimated at  174- million in 1977-73 and  27$ million in a full

year.   This proposal will be included in Regulations to be laid.  

before the House and the Government will be consulting the local

authorities about the financial implications and the best method of

recompensing them for their additional outlay.


36. An electricity discount scheme will also be operated again this

winter in order to relieve households in receipt of family income

supplement or supplementary benefits of 25% of one quarter&apos;s

electricity bill.    [Possible addition indicating estimated cost and

distribution.]

37. The total cost of these measures in 1977-73 will be  150 million.,

38. The relatively large increases in nationalised industries&apos;

prices which were necessary to phase out the massive subsidies of the

early 1970&apos;s and to restore the industries to a \?.OTe economic footing

ore now behind us, and the industries&apos; trading performance is

reflecting the benefit of 2 years of successful pay policy.

With continued moderation on pay, the industries&apos; future price

increases should be much more moderate,  [and ther.3 are no firm

plans for further major increases before the end of 1977.3

Telephone subscribers will benefit this autumn from the recently

announced rebate of  7 on their telephone bills and there will be

no further increase in charges before April 1978 st the earliest.

The Price Commission have told the British Gas Corporation that an

excess profit of  36.6 million for the year ended 31 March 1977

above the reference level permitted by the Price Code must be

eliminated before there can be any further increase in gas prices.

 gicg. .Control

39. The Price Commission Bill, now completing its Parliamentary

stages, provides a more powerful and effective instrument for

Government intervention against unjustified price increases than

has been possible under the system built up since 1973 by successive

 ^rice Codes.    The new Price Commission will be able to freeze

particular prices for up to 3 months during an investigation, and if t&apos;

Commission so recommend,  the Government will have power to extend

the freeze to a year in all.   Distributors&apos; margins may also

be reduced on the recommendation of the Price Commission after an

investigation.   These are touaher powers than the Government possesses


at present, and they can he used rigorously in particular

cases which call for them without bearing down indiscriminately upon

trade and industry.    The .Government will also be able to direct the

Commission to examine Prices and charges across a whole sector, and&apos;

will have powers to order a price freeze or price reductions where the

Commission so recommend.

40.    In addition the Government will lay before Parliament an Order

under the Bill to extend for 1 year the present control over the

profit margins of manufacturers, service firms and distributors.

This Order will hack up the new investigatory powers by providing

a general control over prices and a check against any inflationary

widening of profit margins during the coming year.

&apos;(-1.    The Price Commission Bill provides ia  addi.tion new powers to

prohibit the abuse of &quot;recommended retail price&quot; recommendations and

to require the display of the prices of goods and services.

An Order has already been made under existing powers dealing with the

display of petrol prices in garages.

142.   Following a Government reference, the Price Commission have

reported on retail margins on instant coffee in the light of the very

large increase in coffee prices.    The Government have decided in the

light of this report to make an Order limiting to 8p the retail

margin on a 4-0Z rjar of instant coffee.   The Government will&apos;make &apos;

further referencef; in appropriate coses.]

TAXATION

45.   A number of amendments hove been made to the Finance Bill since

the Budget.   Some of them would have major effects on the revenue.

The Government have now considered these amendments as a whole in

the light of the economic situation and prospects and with particular

reference to the need to Keep within the PSBR limits described in the

Budget statement.

12


&apos;Vl-.    The Government propose that the reduction in petrol duty to its

pre-Budget level should take effect from 6 pm on 8 A\igust, and the

Chancellor of the Exchequer does not intend to look for matching

tax increases elsewhere.

4-5.    The Government accept in principle the view of the House of Commons

Standing Committee which considered the Finance Bill that the income

tax personal allowances should he increased farther.    In reaching

this conclusion they have also taken account of views expressed to

them by the TUC.   Ha\*ever, they consider that the balance of the

increases proposed by the Committee is net right and conflicts with

the original intentions of the Budget.

4-6.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained in his Budget speech

in March that he thought it right this year to increase the married

allowances substantially in order to help the family man during the

transition to the Child Benefit Scheme.   The Standing Committee

amendments however would provide a greater increase in the single

personal, allowance.    The Government therefore propose to increase

the single personal allowance by&apos; SAO and the married person&apos;s allowance

by  ?o ever and above the increases in these allowances announced

in the Budget speech.    There will be corresponding increases in the

wife&apos;s earned income relief, the additional personal allowance for

single people with children and the age allowances.    Particulars of the

changes proposed are set out at Annex C. .

&apos;+?.   The cost of these changes in a full year over and above the

increases proposed in the Budget will be  4-91 million.    In addition,

the Chancellor of tiie Exchequer will propose a reduction in the

basic rate of income tax by 1p from J&gt;5p to 3&apos;+p.    The cost of this

reduction in a full year will be  430 million.    The effect will be

to increase to  ?4 billion in a full year the income tax reductions

in this year&apos;s Finance Bill, which is in line with the original

intention in the Bud-ret.


48.    The further income tax reductions will be generally reflected

in pay packets next month.   The reduction in basic rate and in the

rate of advanced corporation tax will take effect from   6. April as

will the personal allowance changes.   The Inland Revenue will issue

press notices giving full details.

[To be added:    A reference to new Annex with figures for the

detailed implications of the pay/tax policies rather along the

lines of last year&apos;s White Paper.]

SOCIAL BENEFITS

/&apos;x).    The policies described earlier in this White Paper on prices

and   tax reliefs, and indeed on the whole attack on inflation, have

been designed t0 give special help to the low paid, to families,

to pensioners and other specially vulnerable sections of the

community.    Policies on benefits have been directed to the same

objectives.

Child Benefits

50. The Government have decided to increase family support in

1978-79 by a substantial improvement in the rates of child benefit

as part of the further phasing in of the child benefit scheme.

Prom April 1978 child benefit rates will be increased from the

present  1.00 for the first child and  1.50 for subsequent children

to  [      J for.all children.    The new rates will result in part from a

further step in the phasing out of child tax allowances, the basic

level of which will be reduced to [ &apos;] at a net exchequer cost in

1978-79 of some [        ]million.   Regulations for tho new child

benefit rates will he laid shortly and a fuller statement on the

level of child tax allowances in 1978-79 will be mode in due course.

51. This improvement in child benefit will contribute to maintaining

^ improving the living standards of families in the later part of the

Period up to July 1978, to which the pay guidance in paragraph [ J

sPplies.   Hie cnild benefit increase will  ,give most help to


lower-paid working families who either pay no tax now or will be

taken out of tax by the further increases the Government now

propose in tax thresholds.

Pensions

52. The Government have substantially raised the living standards

of retirement pensioners, widows, and the long-term sick and disabled.

The National Ins\irance pension uprating in November last year brought

the single pension to  &apos;&apos;7.55 above its cash level at the time of trie

last uprating of the previous administration, representing an

increase in real terms of some 15%.   Over the same period the real

value of average pay for working people remained more or less constant.

The Government; have already announced further increases in National

&apos;Insurance pensions to take effect in November 1977, which will bring

the pension for a married couple up to  28 a week, and that for a

single person to  17.50.   The increases this autumn should fully

compensate pensioners for the rise in the cost of living over the

preceding 12 months.    In addition introductory work on the new pension

sscheme (Better Pensions) which comes into force in April 1978

is well advanced.

SFiPLOYMENT MID THE INDUSTRIAL STRATEGY

53. Since the   Vrhite Paper of November 1975, we have made great

strides in developing the industrial strategy.    This is based on

tripartite working parties, which have examined the opportunities

for improving domestic and export market shares in their sectors of

manufacturing industry, and the implications for output,

investment ana manpower.   They have already made a considerable impactc

Government thinking, and will be producing their first full reports

at the end of the year.   There has been a useful improvement

recently in the competitive performance of manufacturing industry;

in the second quarter theie was a strong increase in the volume of

manufactured experts, whilst imports of finished goods     . . 

(excluding special North Sea equipment) fell.    


54-.   The Government is assisting industrial investment through the

Industry Acts and the National Enterprise Board, and manufacturing

investment is now expected to he 6 - 10% higher this year than last.

There has &apos;been a review of requirements for early additional

expenditure provision in support of the industrial strategy. As

a result, a further cash sum cf  70 Bullion will he provided, to

he drawn down over the next&apos; few years.   Of this,  40 million will he

allocated to the Ferrous Foundry industry scheme, where the response

from firms has opened up the prospect of important industrial

modernisation.   Secondly, a further  10 million will he allocated

to the Machine Tools industry scheme, reflecting an increase in the

indtistry&apos;s response,    (following discussion with the EEC Commission

on these two proposals, agreement to their introduction is expected

shortly.)   Thirdly, a Produce and Process Development scheme is to

ho introduced, for which  20 million will be made available in the

first instance, to provide more widely bo.sed support in this area.

The Secretary of State for Industry is issuing separate detailed

guidance on this new measure, which responds to a need identified

in a number of Sector Working-Parties.

55. On the employment side, while unemployment remains too high,

in the IE as in many other countries, the Government has taken a

number cf steps to ameliorate its worst effects particularly among

the young.    On 29 -lane a Youth Opportunities Programme was announced,

to be rue by the Manpower Services Commission, providing a range of

training and work expsrience courses for young people at a cost

building up to  160 million a year;   and a Special Temporary

Employment It-ogramme providing jobs for adults at a cost of .

 68 million a year.   Together these schemes are expected to

provide about 160,000 places for those who would otherwise be

unemployed.. .

56. A large number of extra jobs is needed year by year to meet

the present rapid growth of the labour force, which is at present&apos;

running at [       ] a year.   In manufacturing industry, over the

past year to April, the number of people employed has risen by about

.100,000, and this has helped to offset the rise in the working

population.    In the construction industry, however, employment  

has fallen.    In addition to the  100 million for inner cities

announced in the Budget, the Government has therefore decided to


approve up to a further . 100 million for expenditure on construction

in the current financial year.   This will help to maintain employment

at a difficult time before the effects of the forecast; rise in

private sector demand are felt in the industry.    

[Anytliiilg on construction for 1978/79?]

PUBLIC lgPEftDCTURE

57. The Government will maintain firm policies concerning public

sector expenditure.   This is a key element in the campaign against

inflation.   ,

58. The additional expenditure in the current financial year on

the measures announced in this &apos;White Paper will be found from

within the contingency reserve.   Ho change will therefore be

required in the planned total for public expenditure in the current

year.   Supplementary Estimates will be presented to Parliament as

appropriate.


59. The expenditure programmes for 197&amp;-79 will be affected by the

decisions now annoxuiced concerning child benefit and school meals

and the industry schemes.    The Government&apos;s provisional plans for

that year were published in the January public expenditure White

Paper (Cmnd 6721).    For total public expenditure that White Paper

remains the basis for planning.    The programmes will be reviewed

in detail in the regular annual survey before publication of the

next public expenditure White Paper.

Gash Limits

60. The cash limits which apply to extensive areas of public

expenditure will be set consistently with the policies of this

Wnite Paper.

 1     For 1977-78, the cash limits have already been fixed and

published in Cmnd 67&amp;7     No general changes are planned in the

limits.    For 1978-79 the Government will be announcing the cash

limits in time for the start of the new financial year. The

assumptions used will reflect the Government1s policy on pay.

Spending authorities will hot be able to rely on supplementary

provision beyond the cash limits.

TIP3 PUBLIC SECTCjg BORROWING REQUIREMENT

62,   The Government forecast last spring that, if their Budget-

proposals were implemented in full, the public sector borrowing

requirement (PSBR) for 1977-78 would amount to some  8.5 billion,

compared withthe limit of  8.7 billion announced last December at

the time of the agreement with the IMP.    Developments in the economy

siuice the spring point to a reduction in the original forecast.

     They estimate that, after allowance has been made for all. the

measures announced in this White Paper, the PSBR will not exceed

the Budget estimate-of  8.5 billion.   As explained above, the

additions to public expenditure this year will be found from within

the contingency reserve.    The tax measures outlined in this White

I   Paper imply a net addition of [    ] to the PSBR for the current year .

1   as compared with the Budget proposals.    In deciding on the scale


of tax reliefs they could propose the Government have taken account

of the progress achieved on the balance of payments since the Budget,

of the guidance given by the TUC for a phased and orderly return to

normal collective bargaining and of the revised prospect for the

PSBR in 1977/78.

[THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND THE RESERVES

G&apos;!-.   Last year, with confidence at a low ebb, the current account

deficit of  1-5- billion was swelled by over  2 billion of outflows

reflecting a lack of confidence in our ability to run our affairs

properly and get a grip on inflation.   The exchange rate against

the dollar was at one time as low as 01*55 and the reserves declined

to an. all time low of  2  billion.    This year the position has been

transformed.    The current account is now roughly in balance and the

resurgence of confidence has been such that we have already made

up all the ground lost in 1976.    The exchange rate has recovered

and stabilised at around the present rate and the reserves stand

at an all time high of  6  billion.j

MONETARY POLICY

p5    The Government will maintain the limits they set last December

and repeated in the Budget for the PSBR and for Domestic Credit

Expansion (PCE).

06.   por the year to mid-April 1977 Domestic Credit Expansion was

 4.6 billion compared, with the limit of $9 billion and the growth

of sterling M3 Q% compared with the forecast range of 9% -&apos; 13J&amp;.

The outcome for DCE in the second half of 1976/77 was due partly to

the ending of  sterling finance for third country trade and partly

to the unwinding of &quot;ieaas and lags&quot; built up earlier in the year.


67. Pox 1977/78 the Budget forecast was that DCE v;ould .

be comfortably within the limit of  7.7 billion.   The corresponding

growth of sterling M3 was forecast to be in the range 9% - 13%.

During the first 2 months of the financial year the outturn for the

DCE and for sterling 113 has been closely in line with the Budget

forecasts.

CONCLUSION:    THE OPPORTUNITY AIIEAI)

68. The prospects for the UK economy have been transformed as a

result of the adjustments of the past two years.   Sterling is

stable, input prices to industry have actually fallen in the last

two months, Interest rates are down, including mortgage rates, and

with the increasing flow of North Sea oil we can look forward to a.

period of years when it should be possible to avoid balance of

payments crises and the consequent cutbacks in demand whichhave

inhibited investment and growth.

69. None of these gains can be held unless inflation is brought

down to a tolerable level in line with our industrial competitors.

But if we succeed in the attack on inflation we have before us

the prospect of a sustained period in which we can combine steady

growth of our output, of employment, and of our living standards.

The proposals in this white Paper, including the substantial measures

or living standards end employment taken within the Government&apos;s

monetary and financial targets, underline the Government&apos;s

determination to achieve those goals.   We are sure that both

employers and trade unionists in preparing their negotiating positions

for the nerd; year will take account of them and will realise that

moderation at this stage is in their continued interest.

70. .    If they are ready to settle for moderate pay rises then

there is a real prospect of steadily rising living standards from

next year onwards.   If, on the other hand, settlements were to

escalate into a free-for-all the benefits would be frittered away

  and there would be no guarantee that living standards could bo

I sustained. &apos;    


7&lt;1    we are offered an opportunity which the British economy has

&apos; not seen for very many years.   With the support of the trade

union movement, employers and the ordinary working people of

Britain, we are confident that a great prise is within our grasp.


TUG PAY; GUIDANCE

The 12 month interval between settlements_

On 22 June 1977 the General Council of the TUC issued the

following statement, which the   Government fully endorse:-

The General Council attach the utmost importance

to the continued observance by negotiators of the

guidelines of the  2.50/5%/ 4 policy adopted by

Congress and without exception honoured in

settlements so far reached by affliliated unions,

including the requirement of a 12 month interval

the majority of woi&apos;kers who have already settled

under the policy.   Self-financing producitivity

after July 31*

DRAFT STATEMENT ON COUNTER INFLATION POLICY:  FRIDAY 15 JULY

With permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to make&apos;a statement

about the outcome of the discussions between the Government

and the Trades Union Congress about pay during the 12 months

beginning on 1 August next, and about the further measures

which the Government propose to take against inflation.

Pay Discussions

2.    In the last two years the guidelines on pay which the

TUC have been able to issue in agreement with the Government

and which have been loyally observed by the Trades Union

movement, have made a major contribution to the attack on

inflation.    And for the period after July 1977, the TUC have

been concerned to ensure an orderly return to normal,

decentralised collective bargaining.    In this context, the

TUC have emphasised the importance of avoiding a pay explosion

in the period ahead and of achieving a climate favourable

to moderation in pay settlements.    As a major contribution

towards these objectives the TUC General Council published

guidance on 22 June on the strict maintenance of settlements

made uner the  2.50/5#/lA policy.    Subject to two special

exceptions, relating to occupational pensions and genuine

self-financing productivity schemes, the TUC guidance says

that negotiators should not re-open settlements made under


the  2.50/5^/ ^ policy after 31 July in breach of the

12 months rule; and should not defer settlements due under

that policy until after 31 July in the hope of securing

an advantage by doing so.    Observance of this guidance,

which should be adhered to by all those concerned

with pay determination in both the private and the

public sectors, is of cardinal importance for the

avoidance of an excessive rate of earnings increase

in the year from August 1977.This means  that the

effect of the Phase 2 policy will last until the end

of July 1978.

3. The Government has a dual responsibility for the

health of the economy as a whole and for the

management of the public sector.    The Government consider

that it is their responsibility to give some further

guidance to all those concerned with pay determination,

and to working people generally, on the level of pay settle-

ments in the next period when the 12 months has expired

for the bargaining group concerned.

4. If we are to secure - as we must secure - single

figure inflation early next year, and to maintain it

throughout the year, the rate of increase in earnings

in the next round must not exceed 10$. This


in turn means that the general level of settlements must

he well within single figures.    The Government will he

guided by this consideration, in determining those

settlements for which it is responsible as an employer.

They strongly recommend others concerned with pay

determination in both the private and the public sectors

to be guided by the same requirement.   New settlements

should be made on the basis that they will last for 12

months.   /CBI: TUG response/

,5.     It will not be possible in the next 12 months to deal

with the whole range of pay anomalies and other problems

that have inevitably arisen during a period of strict pay

guidelines.    Only the most serious difficulties can be

tackled in the coming year, if necessary oh a phased basis

and taking full account of the need to keep total

settlements within single figures.

6.    The outcome of the Government&apos;s discussions with

the TUC, and the development of the economic situation

since the Budget, now enable me to put before the

House my considered proposals for taxation this year,

and for certain further measures to improve the current

prospect for prices and employment.    The Government has

made these decisions in order to improve the climate for

pay negotiations in the coming round, and has been

particularly concerned to protect the position of

families and the low paid.


Taxation

7. The reduction already agreed in petrol duty

will take effect from 6.00 pm on 8 August.

I do not intend to look for offsetting tax increases

elsewhere.

8. The Government also accept the principle expressed

in certain amendments made at Committee Stage of the Finance

Bill that the income tax personal allowances should he

increased further.   However, I explained in my Budget

Statement why I wished to concentrate relief this year

particularly on families.    By contrast, the Committee Stage

amendments would tilt the balance in favour of the single

personal allowance .    I shall therefore be proposing at

Report Stage of the Finance Bill to substitute an amendment,

increase the allowances, but

which will/restore the balance of my original proposal in

favour of families.    It will increase the single personal

allowance by  4-0 and the married person&apos;s allowance by  70

as compared with the increase in these allowances which I

originally proposed in my Budget speech,at a cost of some

 4-90m; and there will be corresponding increases in other

allowances.   At the same time, I will propose a reduction in


the basic rate of income tax by 1p from 35p to 34p, at

a cost of some  /\&amp;0m.    The total costs of the income tax

reliefs in this year&apos;s Finance Bill will thus come to some

 2-J billion - closely in line with my original intention in

the Budget.

Child Benefit

9   .    The Government have also decided to increase family

support in 1978-79 by a substantial improvement in the

rate of child benefit as part of the further phasing in of

the child benefit scheme.   From April 1978 child benefit

rates will he increased from the present  1.00 for the first

child and  1.50 for subsequent children to /~~   J for all

children, at a net Exchequer cost of some  /~   _7 million.

Prices

1&apos;0      The Government have decided to take action on certain

/cost of living

increases in the directly affected by decisions in the public

sector which would otherwise take effect this year, and which

are particularly burdensome for people on low incomes or

with family commitments.

11.    Milk is an important item in family budgets, especially

when there are several children.    The Government are

therefore increasing the milk subsidy in order to avert the

an immediate

need for / further price rise of 1-Jp a pint. The

cost will he about  110ra falling in the financial year

1977-78.


12.    The Government have also decided to raise the income

threshold for eligibility for free school meals.    This will

with free school meals

.provide   over half a million more children&apos;and increase the

total number eligible to over- one quarter of those children

who take school meals.    The cost will be  17 m in 1977-78

and  27-5-m in a full year.

Employment and the Industrial Strategy

13. ,   The Government announced last month a programme of

training and work experience courses for young people at a

cost building up to  16Cm a year; and a Special Temporary

Employment Programme providing jobs for adults at a cost

of  58m a year.

ity.    The Government have also decided to provide up to a

further  100m for construction in the current financial year,

to maintain employment in the construction industry, which

is now going through a particularly difficult time.   This is

in addition to the  100m for inner cities which I announced

in the Budget.

15.    The Government have also reviewed the requirements for

additional expenditure in support of the industrial strategy.

As a result, a further cash sum of  70m will be provided,

to be drawn down over the next few years for schemes in the

ferrous foundry and machine tools industries and for a new

product and process development scheme.


Public Expenditure

,16.    The new measures which I have just announced will add

an estimated     m to public expenditure in the current year.

This sum will be found from within the Contingency Reserve,

so that no change will be required in the planned total for

public expenditure in the current year.

17. The individual expenditure programmes for 1978-79 will

also be affected by the decisions now announced concerning

child benefit and school meals.    However for total public

expenditure the White Paper published last January (Cmnd 6721)

remains the basis for general planning.

Cash Limits

18. For 1977-78 the cash limits have already been fixed

and published in Cmnd 6767.   No general changes are planned

in the limits.    Nor 1978-79 the assumptions used will

reflect the Government&apos;s policy on pay.    Spending authorities

will not be able to rely on supplementary provision beyond

the cash limits.


Public Sector Borrowing Requirement and Monetary Policy

19-    Taken by themselves, the tax measures which I have

announced this afternoon imply a net addition of     m to

the Budget estimate for the PSBR for the current year. On

the other hand developments in the economy generally since

the spring point to a reduction in the original forecast.

As I have explained, the additions to public expenditure

this year will be found from within the Contingency Reserve,

and imply no additional change on the PSBR.    On balance, I

am satisfied that there is no reason to increase the Budget

estimate for the PSBR of  8.5 billion - that is, a figure

within the limit of  8.7 billion v/hich&apos;I announced last

December at the time of the IMF agreement.

2Q.    Equally, I am satisfied that the measures which I have

announced this afternoon are consistent with the limits

which I have announced for DCE and the money supply (M3),

and which the Government will maintain.

White Paper

21&apos;.    Further details of these measures and of the Government&apos;s

policies for the attack on inflation, are contained in a

White Paper which is being published today, and which is

now available in the Vote Office.


Conclusion

22. Mr Speaker, in deciding on the measures which I have

announced this afternoon, the Government have taken account

of the progress achieved on the balance of payments since

the Budget, of the guidance given by the TUC for a phased

and orderly return to normal collective bargaining and of

the revised prospects for the PSBR in 1977-78.

23. These measures will give substantial additional

protection to living standards for working people

generally, and especially for families with children and

those with earnings well below the average.    Indeed,they

will themselves be enough or more than enough for the

great majority of workers to offset fully the price

increase of less than k% which the Government expects

between now and the end of this year.

2k.    As I have said, an orderly return to normal collective

bargaining - with the increase in average earnings not

exceeding 10$ - is essential to our objective of getting

inflation down to single figures and keeping it there.

These measures will ensure that it is also consistent

with at least maintaining the average family&apos;s living

standards through the next 12 months.    I believe that the

Government have given the necessary guidance to those

concerned with pay negotiations and that these measures

have created the conditions in which it can be observed.

The Government look to the Trades Union movement, to

employers in the private&apos;/sector? and to the country as a

-Q- /


whole for continued support in the common enterprise

of conquering inflation and assuring a sound basis for the

future growth of output, employment and&quot; living

standards.
