DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77) 72 COPY NO     g 4 July 1977CABINETFAMILY SUPPORTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. A Ministerial Group under my chairmanship have considered thegeneral case for improving family support and the methods by which this might be done.    I attach a summary of the paper by officials, which provided the comprehensive basis for our study, and two important tables(1 and 2) showing respectively the development of net income in real terms inthe quarter following each Budget since 1974 and a range of options for thesecond phase of the Child Benefit (CB) scheme starting in April 1978.2- The Group saw a strong case, both on the merits and on political grounds and not confined to poor families, for increased family support in1978-79.    Although, as paragraph 3 of the summary indicates, the figures in Table 1 do not show families at a significant disadvantage compared withsingle people or couples without children (and in the case of the few familiesat the lowest income levels protected by upratings of means-tested benefits,they have done relatively well), we considered that in practice all familieshad suffered diaproportionately from the fall in living standards by reasonof their smaller margin of discretionary expenditure and, most oftenperhaps in the case of larger families, by the wife&apos;s inability to earn.CHILD BENEFIT3. The Group considered that high priority should be given to anincreased CB rate as a means of improving family support.    Although thecost of this is high in relation to the individual benefit received( 6 million per lp increase per child), the benefit for larger families is appreciable;a^d it goes directly to the wife.    We did not favour as a means ofalternau&quot; tatonal support the option of retaining child tax allowancesat their current level in 1978-79.    This would represent a further change ofcourse in the phasing-in of CB for which, with the help of the Trades UnionCongress (TUC)/Labour Party Working Party&apos;s recommendations lastyear, there is now wide support.1
4. On the rate to which CB should be increased, the Group felt that this could only be determined by the Cabinet in the context of the public expenditure review.    Of the options set out in Table 2 (to the costs of which 17 million must be added in each case if the standard rate of tax is reducedto 33 per cent, thus reducing the tax offset), the Minister for social security argued very strongly for  2. 40 (option 7) as the absolute minimum required to counter the charge that working families with children have hadless help from Labour than from the Tories.    This would restore the over-all level of direct family support for the families to at least the level of1974-75 at a cost of  320 million.    The overall level would still be significantly lower than the Conservative peak provision of 1971-72 buthigher,, by about the eame amount, than their relatively low provision in1973-74.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury, foreshadowing the difficultiesreferred to in paragraphs 14 and 15 of CP(77) 69, did not believe that itwould be possible to justify a higher rate than  2 per child with a premiumof 50p for children in one-parent families at a cost of  112 million (option 3).In the view of the large majority of the Group, however, this would be too low to make a sufficient impact.SCHOOL MEALS5- The Group also considered the possibility of giving further help tofamilies with school meals.    Out of 5. 9 million children (about 70 per cent)who take school dinners, nearly 900, 000 receive the meal free of charge.The other 5 million at present pay 15p a meal for which the average cost is50p.    The charge is to be raised by lOp at the beginning of the autumn term1977;  the entitlement to free meals and the take-up will then increase inconsequence.    The increased charge has been announced and the relateddecrease in local authority expenditure has been taken into account in the fixing of Rate Support Grant.    A reversal of this decision would be highlyunpopular with local authorities and add to the resentment about educationalcuts in other directions.    The group s view was that a suspension of theincrease in school meal charges should not be regarded as a substitute for ahigher rate of CB and could only be justified in the separate context of asettlement with the TUC over the third pay round.SCHOOL TRANSPORT6- The Group did not consider that it would be feasible in the short termto provide for increased assistance through school transport arrangements.Without legislation, which would be contentious, the Government cannotdirectly influence these arrangements, although consultations with localeducation authorities are in train to see whether agreement can be reached on an acceptable scheme.2
FAMILY INCOME SUPPLEMENT7. Last year Home and Social Affairs Committee approved in principlea proposal that the full-time work condition for claiming family income supplement should be reduced from 30 to 24 hours a week for one-parent families in order to provide more incentive for lone parents to take a job.The Group favoured this proposal but it is not a factor in determining therate of CB.    It is costed at  1. 5 million a year and the Chief Secretary,Treasury&apos;s view is that it should be accommodated within the Department ofHealth and Social Security programme.conclusions. The Group were agreed that there was a strong case for increasedfamily support in 1978-79 and that this should be given, as a major priority,through CB.    They felt that thy appropriate rate could only be determined bythe Cabinet in the context of the public expenditure review, but the consensusof view was that the rate mentioned by the Chief Secretary, Treasury(option 3) was too low to make a sufficient impact.M RHome Office4 July 19773

The case for devoting additional resources to family support at the next stage of phasing in April 1978 must depend partly on the actual development of family incomes under thepresent Government.   The general picture is that living standardsfer all family types (with and vn^hout (g^l^fii:^flat between. 1974 and 1976 but/have &quot;since fallen sharply except c&quot; mmlowest income levels where families with children have been protected by upratings of means-tested benefits, notably family income supplemenAt other income levels couples with children have generally doneslightly worse than couples without, but this is probably lass signifi-cant - than the fact that, since these with children are committed toa higher level of.essential expenditure,.they have a smaller margin of discretionary expenditure and may therefore be more conscious qjthe squeeze on living standards (which,-however&apos;,, is not expected tocontinue).
&apos;!-c   This could be relevant to the discussions on a third round of pay policy.   But, apart from a reference in the TUG EconomicReview, there has as yet teen no direct evidence that familysupport will feature in these discussions.    If past experience is any guide, the TUG may he more interested in price.subsidiesthan in child benefit.If Ministers wish to take any action in the light of this generaposition, they will wish to consider which policy instrument canbeet achieve their specific objectives.   If the aim is to relievepoverty among low income families, then improving universal familysupport would not be a cost-effective approach, since only 15 per c^lof child benefit expenditure is of assistance to poor families(and even this figure does not include those who get no net benefitbecause of the interaction of child benefit with means tested bens 31However, the purpose of. universal family support is to achieve equi&apos;3between those with different family responsibilities at given income levels (ie 1 horizontally1).   What constitutes equity is a matter for political judgement, since it involves weighing the personalsatisfactions which lead parents to choose to have children (whichargues that they should bear some of the cost) against the benefitto the whole community of another generation (which argues for a community contribution).   But political judgement may be influenced by the effects of the recent fall in living standards described inparagraph 3 above.6c    The constraint on political choice lies in the general public expenditure situation.    While during the phasing in period for chit3benefit the.tax saving from the withdrawal of child tax allowancesis being set against the additional expenditure on child benefit,any increase in child benefit beyond the straight transfer from CTAjwould count as an increase in public expenditure for which there isat present on provision in PESO.   Ministers will therefore wish toconsider this and any other proposals for directing additionalfinancial help to families in a PESO context, so that they can beweighted with other claims on the limited resources -available.7.   Proposals for action to help families other than through childbenefit include withdrawal of next September1 s increase in schoolcharges and help with children&apos;s fares.   But the Sub-Group (other tflthe Department of Prices)
nave concluded that action through child benefit is to be preferred(not least because there can be no certainty that these optionswould in practice be alternatives, rather than additions, to actionon child benefit).   Nor were they attracted to the option ofregaining CTA&apos;s at their current level in 1978-79.    Since, however,the level of elite support is a natter for political judgment(paragraph 5 above), the Sub-Group have not made any recommendationeither on whether there should be an increase in child benefit in-April 1978 or on the amount of any increase,.   A number of optionsranging between just the next stage of phasing in the child benefitscheme at no net cost, to expenditure of  J20 million a year to restore the 1974-75 level of child support are, however, presented for consideration by Ministers.8.xhe Sub-Group therefore conclude thata,tho purpose of child support is to achieve equity between those with different family responsibilities rather than to relieve poverty;d.   the right vehicle for any additional help to familiesgenerally (as distinct from poverty relief) is child benefit(the Department of Prices, however, reserving their position);Co   decisions on any increase in child support should betaken in a PESO context;the level of child support is a matter for political judgement.Ministers are therefore invited to decide whether there is a prima facie-or devoting additional resources to child support, and if so to. ***** cnat the form and amount of any such help for families should hesi ered in the context of tho public expenditure review.COEKEMSSTIili
